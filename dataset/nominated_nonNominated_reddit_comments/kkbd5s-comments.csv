gh1jyxb,"if anyone lives in nyc.... this movie was unbelievably touching in its attention to detail. the subway trains, the fences around the little gardens on the sidewalk, the streets, the buildings. even the blue note reference. it was pretty emotional seeing my city bursting with life, especially during these trying times.",kkbd5s
gh1kuhb,I loved the contrast between the first time they show all the mundane things Joe does and he says ‘my life was meaningless’ and then the ending montage shows him finding joy in all of those mundane moments.,kkbd5s

gh1j3fj,"To just live is enough. Such a great message. Life being full of ups and downs is OK. The journey is better than the destination. Live in the now. I dig it.

gh8du1p,"I see a lot of people crying foul with how abruptly it ends. I felt that the ending was designed to be ambiguous. 

It's not about what career path that Joe chooses.

It's about the fact that *whatever* career he chooses, he'll be living life to its fullest.

He starts off as a man unable to walk down the street without getting killed because of his massive tunnel-vision, and he ends as a man who has learned to embrace the present.

I dug that they went with an ambiguous ending. Many other animated films would have spelled things out for the audience.

This one trusts the viewer.

Edit- The filmmakers actually cited multiple different endings that they tried. Here's a link:

gh2hjeu,"On a side note, that bug-zap sound effect when souls entered the Great Beyond was absolutely fucking horrifying.",kkbd5s
gh1k647,22's lost soul inner dialogue was a whole mood and I identified a little TOO well with those voices in her head.,kkbd5s
gh1mpmy,"I'm genuinely interested to see if kids like this movie. I can usually separate the two in Pixar movies where there's the kid's movie and the parts for grown-ups sewn into it. This feels distinctly the opposite - there's the cat/guy buddy movie, sure, but it really mainly feels like a movie for adults with kid stuff thrown in

Edit: I LOVED the movie, and I think it's an interesting move for Pixar, potentially starting a push toward making mainstream animation for older audiences - I wish this was in theaters (not just because it's gorgeous to watch) so that we could see how it did monetarily compared to others. It's almost like something Laika would do, but Pixar",kkbd5s
gh5qvtq,At the end of the credits you Terry comes out and yells “the movies over! Go home!” Even though everybody is home,kkbd5s
gh1j6jn,I just want to give a shout out to Terry.  Just an unappreciated cosmic accountant trying to do their job the best they can.,kkbd5s
gh1j9nw,The scene toward the end of Joe remembering seemingly insignificant yet beautiful moments of everyday life was the highlight for me. Really thought he'd realize his spark would be teaching. Good overall.,kkbd5s
gh1lx48,"This movie's portrayal of jazz is astounding. The call and responses between Joe and Dorothea in their first song, to the blues of the next, to the swing of the next, just took everything about the genre that I adored.

Connie going to Joe (really 22) to tell him how much she hates band, followed by her saying how much it sucks, playing a minute-long solo, and then deciding to stick with it, with 22-Joe just saying ""hey you're really good at that"" was such a teenager thing to do. Loved that moment especially.

When they showed Joe playing in front of his father, with him just nodding to the music with his eyes closed, I was practically bawling. It was just the silent approval of Joe's calling that his father seemed to notice struck all kinds of nerves.

10/10. Amazing in all aspects.",kkbd5s
gh1kg0a,"""Hands are hard!""

I'm sure they are, considering how insanely impressive the hand movements in this movie are during the musical instrument scenes. 

Cute inside joke!

Also, **Pizza Planet Truck** is in the Hall of Everything.",kkbd5s

gh1jjoq,"The message of ‘your spark isn’t your purpose in life, it’s what makes you want to live’ was one that hit me right in the existential gut.",kkbd5s
gh1iyy8,"The knicks joke was hilarious. 

But also man what a movie, the Jerry’s were hilarious. Pretty sure one of them was a headspace guy. Very deep movie, well made and a great combination of entertainment and depth",kkbd5s
gh1lvph,"Shout outs to Rachel House who absolutely knocked it out of the park as meticulous bureaucratic stickler Terry. Great comedic delivery, stole the scene every time for me.

""aw yeah, Terry Time...""",kkbd5s
gh1j7y6,"That scene of Joe playing while he has flashbacks of all the beautiful, tiny moments in life (feet on the beach, enjoying a great dessert, etc.) will go down as one of the all-time best Pixar scenes, mark my words. Such a beautiful depiction of the film’s message that life isn’t always about being hyper passionate about something and making your life revolve around it, you can be perfectly fulfilled by just enjoying the beauty of life, and that’s a message I really needed to hear.

Definitely a top 5 Pixar film for me, which is a huge accomplishment for the studio that has most of my favorite films!",kkbd5s
gh1j02o,[deleted],kkbd5s
gh1iyp8,"Absolutely loved it. I wasn't expecting that between this and WW84, Soul was the movie I wished I could have seen on the big screen.",kkbd5s
gh1ja8f,"That scene where 22 (in joe's body) is sitting outside on the steps watching the people nearby, and the leaves in the wind, with that little leaf falling to her hand, just enjoying her life, teared me up, not gonna lie.",kkbd5s
gh1niis,"I cant get over the lighting in this movie. I feel Pixar made a huge jump in general with this movie in regards to animation, but the lighting looked as close to real life as I could imagine an ""animated"" movie being.",kkbd5s
gh80yd2,"WOW Pixar has done it again. I was waiting for something on par with Inside Out (Pixar’s best imo) and this gets in that ballpark. Just wow. How many times is Pixar gonna make this grown man learn something about himself

The scene where Joe is looking through all of the dark mentors that caused 22’s soul to be lost and at the end he sees himself... chills man

The movie was also clearly taking a stab at the education system (You Seminar). Criticizing its failure in actually finding student’s “spark”. Making sure we place a bigger emphasis on experience rather than education

I also loved how this movie struck a balance in its message. Usually movies cater to the “follow your dreams, not what society/school tells you to follow” audience , but this movie takes it a step further and says, “be careful in following your dreams, dont become so obsessed and arrogant about them that you miss out on the simpler things”. So fucking good man

Also, that ending sequence where Joe sees all the memories that made his life worth living, that shit was straight out if American Beauty. Made me shed a tear",kkbd5s
gh1izqr,Having Graham Norton as a hippy soul pirate/spiritual sign twirler was the greatest Xmas present I ever received,kkbd5s
gh3hf3a,"Am I the only one who feels bad for Robert, the pianist who almost got the quartet gig instead of Joe? Hopefully he had the same epiphany about life & not being obsessed with one purpose",kkbd5s
gh1uld2,I felt Pixar finally got the signoff to say the word hell and they were trying to get their money's worth,kkbd5s
gh3fng5,Anybody else think the 14 minute credit sequence would have a post credit scene?,kkbd5s
gh1iypp,"When Joe Gardner is playing the piano at his home near the end of the film, he has all the stuff 22 collected scattered on the top, and he just remembers his whole life. 

Memories that seems small, but mean so much more when you really think about it. 

This year has been more than difficult, and we take a lot of things for granted. 2020 has been life changing. 

So seeing Joe just remember the simplest of things, and loving every second of it was beautiful. 

That scene hit differently, moreso than even Pete Docter or Kemp Powers intended.

10/10",kkbd5s
gh1iva7,"""You can't crush a soul here, that's what Earth is for"" /r/2me4meirl. Also it's suitably crushing that all of the woes of the Knicks are due to 22 (and James Dolan).

Also the intro felt like Disney's take on the [Fox recorder intro](https://youtu.be/XCPj4JPbKtA)",kkbd5s
gh1lgw9,22 landed in the middle of Nepal or some shit. Hope she turns out ok,kkbd5s
gh1izay,"Soul is a very good movie. It kinda showed me the meaning of life. Classic Pixar movie where I felt like life is worth living after watching it.
Also the barbershop was pretty good representation as expected from the trailer",kkbd5s
gh3v6hn,"I noticed the camera ever so slightly and gently moving in some scenes, giving the film a much more natural feel; like someone is holding a camera. It occurred to me during the barbershop scene, and now I'm having a crisis trying to think if this is new for animation or if they've done this before and I've only just realised!",kkbd5s
gh1jmf8,I can’t remember the last time I resonated with someone more than I did when Joe was running away screaming “why aren’t you running!?” And the one soul just shrugs his shoulders,kkbd5s
gh1jfqz,"I actually liked how the ending ended abruptly. Shows how we don’t know what Joe will do now because he himself doesn’t know what he’ll actually do, but just enjoy his life. 

Also, shouldn’t that cat be dead because it was seen he was going into the great beyond?",kkbd5s
gh1jz26,Pixar should be arrested for murdering every Knicks fan on the planet,kkbd5s
gh1iwxb,"This film floored me in many many ways... but that score from Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross, and Jon Batiste!

It’s crazy to me that out of all the characters in the film, whenever Terry’s theme would play, you would automatically know who it was. That honestly shouldn’t come as no surprise from Reznor & Ross, but they really outdid themselves with this one. 

It has a sense of euphoria to it, yet it’s playful, then it’s intense, and then it makes you bawl like a damn baby. I don’t know how they do it, but they seem to do it every time!",kkbd5s
gh1jfm7,I can’t see kids really enjoying this movie. But it felt like therapy for me and really challenged the way I think about things. I love how philosophical it was. So creative and thought provoking and exactly what we need in cinema right now!,kkbd5s
gh1jg85,One of the best movies of the year. Loved the scene where Joe in the cat can’t stay awake in the sun,kkbd5s
gh1kalx,"For some reason it really bugged me that he took a cab from the hospital to his apartment, but he had no money.

Cabbies in such competing with Uber that they're giving free rides now?",kkbd5s
gh2lj6c,"The show with Dorothea was such a great scene. I was on the edge of my seat, expecting something to go wrong, for him to blank under the pressure or something. But when the concert goes fantastically, afterwards we see that the problem was that it DID meet expectations: it was awesome. So then the problem is ""now what?"" Or ""was that it?"". In the end we realize the message - that living in the moment and letting go of great expectations of destiny is the way to see the true beauty of life. All accompanied by that sweet sweet JAZZ. Wow",kkbd5s
gh4lknq,OKAY BUT WHICH SOUL HAS BEEN FUCKING WITH THE DETROIT LIONS ALL THIS TIME,kkbd5s
gh1wyvp,"Watched this movie with my mom, and when Joe starts remembering his whole life and realizes that the little moments are what makes life worth living - the whole point of the movie - my mom goes “Why is he remembering these things now? What’s this got to do with anything?” And I just thought I’d share that because it’s such a Mom thing to say.",kkbd5s
gh2y4yt,This movie was absolutely fantastic. It really hit it out of the park and I think it’s cool Disney sort of bit a bullet here and released what is obviously a huge production film to streaming. Everything about the film was a home run and my god the animation was out of this world.,kkbd5s
ghp0bh5,"I don't think this movie would have hit as hard if I weren't depressed. A few weeks ago, I would have killed myself if I had the nerve to do it. Recently, I've just felt more indifferent towards life. I wouldn't have cared if something killed me. This movie, though... This movie made me want to keep on living. There is no true purpose in life besides just living - and living is beautiful. I haven't felt this way for months - if anything, my head has been exactly like 22's was close to the end of the movie since this summer. I truly hated myself and life until now. It made me cry and cry and cry at the end, but in a good way for once. This movie has made an impact on me like nothing else recently has been able to, and I applaud it for that. Thank you, Pixar, for showing me why life is worth living.",kkbd5s
gh5d481,"*Finally accomplishes his dream.*

Joe- ""I thought it'd feel different.""

Dorothea- ""There's this story. A young fish tells an old fish, ""I want to reach the ocean."" The old fish says, ""Young fish, the ocean is *water.*"" The young fish responds, ""I know, but I wanna reach the *ocean.*""

Joe stands there dejected.

Dorothea- See you tomorrow. (She gives him a wry smile, as if she knows that every night is a grind)

That shit got me good. Joe realizes that his life has already started a long time ago. Reaching his dream wasn't the beginning of it. 

There was no magic pill that was ever going to make him feel fulfilled.

The only way out was to embrace the life that was already around him. 

As an artist, I felt that hard. Always imagining that there would be a 'day' when I would be famous. 

Until realizing that there would be no 'day.' The grind never stops. Life doesnt stop just because you 'made it.'

And Joe had to reckon with the notion of, ""what now?""",kkbd5s
gh1ixqm,"This movie was exactly what I needed right now. 

Throughout this year, I’ve been wrestling with feelings of inadequacy and anxiety about trying to jumpstart my career during Covid, fixating on the successes of people I graduated with, and making sure I’m productive enough so that I don’t throw away my potential. I feel like so many of us allow our passions to become toxic obsessions and take over our identities. 

I found that my success in my field or lack thereof came to determine my self-worth, and this movie teaches a valuable lesson in not missing out on the life that happens in between. I rewatched ‘It’s a Wonderful Life’ with the family yesterday, and this is a worthy companion piece. I have no idea if kids are gonna understand what the fuck is happening in this movie, but as an adult man I am glad to have it in my life.

Pete Docter and Pixar know just how to poke me right in the feels every time. They can’t keep getting away with it.

Also damn RIP Knicks fans lmao",kkbd5s
gh1iwbz,One of my favorite Pixar movies ever. Just so good on every level. I would have loved to see this in theaters.,kkbd5s

gha9lw4,This may be the most existential movie Pixar released to date. The scene where it pans out to the entire universe just shows how we really aren’t anything other than small organisms in space and should just enjoy the short time we have in this universe.,kkbd5s
gh1z6bl,The trying to hail a taxi as a black man in NYC is gonna be one of the most adult jokes Pixar has ever done.,kkbd5s
ghb9zzr,Towards the end I finally realized the “catch 22” as they tried to catch 22. Your life has purpose when you give your life purpose.,kkbd5s
ghbaocr,"Joe was so focused on his goal of being successful in Jazz, so that his life could start, that it shaded his memories of the rest of his life. Moments unrelated to his jazz career felt like moments of failure to him. Meanwhile he minimized the pain that his journey for a jazz career caused him, because of his passion for it. So when he and 22 are in his memory hall, it shows some memories that should/could be positive ones as sad, and he is surprised to see some of the jazz memories are not so positive when he sees the specifics. Later on at the end when he is realizing his life was always happening, and there were always good things in it, he re-sees some of the memories that had felt sad to him (i.e. eating a piece of pie), with a new gratitude that shows him life is worth living, not just for jazz.  I could go on and on about the message of this movie and how beautiful and meaningful it is. Loved this movie.",kkbd5s
gh1tm60,[deleted],kkbd5s
gh48ny1,"This movie hit me in my existential crisis. Almost reaching my 30s (still young, I know), with no real purpose in sight, dealing with depression and struggling to find any meaning in my existence...I think I needed this movie and the message it's trying to send.






You gotta give meaning to those little moments, as trivial as they may seem, because even if you think that you don't have a place in this world that's definitely not true. Life is worth living, it can be hard to realize it sometimes I know, but it's worth it. Thank you again Pixar, you managed to bring tears to my soul once again.",kkbd5s
gh1ixdg,[deleted],kkbd5s
gh1mqiz,Absolutely blown away by this. Gave it a shot with our 6 year old girl and she was asking questions in the first few minutes. Wife and I were like uuuuuuuuh. This was just such a deep look at life. Held back the usual Pixar tears at the end. There was so much to unpack I can’t wait for more viewings.,kkbd5s
gzc7gtz,"That one scene where he's playing the piano with all of the objects from 22's day in front of him and he was FEELING the emotions SHE felt. That childlike bliss and wonder that modern society and the 9-5 grind tends to make you forget about. And then he was able to flashback and remember moments in his life when he was in the moment again, and how beautiful they are. 

That hit me like a ton of bricks. Probably the most beautiful Pixar scene. I'm still slow crying, it's like it threw me back to the moment where I realized and remember those childlike feelings of bliss and awe and then had my own flashbacks of moments in my life that meant the world to me. It happened on a deep shroom trip and I'm forever thankful for that and I'm forever thankful for this movie for reigniting that. Unreal.",kkbd5s
ghcojnp,"I attempted suicide a couple weeks ago due to a LOT of things (not having a purpose in life, trauma, losing a relationship that spanned almost a decade, etc) and just got out of the psych ward and I..... god. This movie was so visceral to me. I remember the cold wind hitting my body as I stepped out of the psych ward for the first time. I felt actually cold, not slightly colder than room-temperature due to wearing short sleeved scrubs cold. I felt the sun, I saw it, not fluorescent lighting in my room and in the hallway that got turned off at night. I realized I’d been alive but never *lived in the moment*, never felt alive. I felt like I was a new person dropped into my body, as I shivered in the street clothes I had tried to kill myself in the week prior. I felt like.... I felt so much in that moment. I still do. I can feel myself falling back into my old depressive patterns, but shit. 


Pardon me. I’ve been crying since I finished the movie 10min ago and writing this made me cry more.",kkbd5s
gh2zkl4,"That poor kitty soul getting kicked out and sent to heaven!

*Sad meow*",kkbd5s
gh1jmtx,"I went into this movie fully expecting to end up bawling. And while I did cry a bit (when 22 as Joe gave his speech to his mom about if I die today will my life have been worth living?), I honestly have never felt so optimistic finishing a movie. As a single guy in his late 20s still doing his best living through a pandemic and trying to be happy while I see everyone’s achievements of marriages and kids and trying to pursue your one passion, a movie who’s message was “it’s ok if you don’t know what your passion is. Live your life, even the simple things can give you purpose.” Really hit hard. Maybe we need a passion, maybe we don’t, but the ups and downs of life along the way make your life passionate. Honestly I’ve never felt this way from a movie. 

My only complaint is that Daveed Diggs has like three lines. Also I’m glad I didn’t pay 30 bucks to see this, but it would’ve been worth it.",kkbd5s

gh9895t,"This is, by far, the best rendition of New York City in any animated movie that I’ve ever seen.

The Pixar crew absolutely nailed the following things that every animated movie (and most live-action ones) miss, usually by a mile:


-	the little shops in Queens
-	Basically Queens in general
-	*dirt on the subway walls*
-	subway *routes* (Joe lives in Queens. He takes the M to go home. The M ends in Ridgewood, which is in Queens. He also takes the 7 from the school that he works at, which connects to the M at Court Square...which Soul also nails with the curve off near Silvercup)
-	the *propulsion sound* of the new subway trains (which the 7 uses, but they animated an older train...which I can forgive)
-	the stream of lights that you see in the subway tunnels as you are moving
-	the annoying fucking spinner things that fall from trees, and
-	the tiny ass apartment that most people actually live in

My wife and I moved away four years ago. This is the first movie that made me miss NYC. It’s the little things I miss, and Soul fucking nailed them.",kkbd5s
ghc2v1c,"I saw many comments on Pixar subreddit that they wanted a longer ending, montage of Joe’s and 22’s lives or something like that.

I think ending is brilliant. It isn’t a film about overcoming some kind of obstacle after which your life would be purposeful and great, so we can see our characters living happily after that. 

It’s about realizing life happens in every moment, that you won’t find your meaning in one particular moment but in realizing that every day is special and not to be taken for granted.

Didn’t think Pixar would done it again, thought no way this could be close to Inside Out or Coco. I was wrong.

Thank you Docter. Thank you Pixar.",kkbd5s

*Pixar was mindful of the history of racist imagery in animation, and set out to create characters who were recognizably black while avoiding the stereotypes in old cartoons. Acknowledging this effort, Peter Docter stated that ""There's a long and painful history of caricatured racist design tropes that were used to mock African-Americans."" According to Kemp Powers, the animators used lighting as a way to highlight the ethnic diversity in the living world. Pixar sought to capture the fine details of these black characters, including the textures of black hair and the way light plays on various tones of black skin.

I’m enjoying Pixar toying with big questions of mortality and purpose. This experiment within the crossroads of black culture, jazz, and “life’s purpose” play out fairly well - the jokes don’t go on too long, the seriousness of the film sits well between lighthearted frame-altering conversations, and seeing the value of black communities really made this film more of a standout than I guessed.

But. 

The first Jerry mentions that she is a being beyond the comprehension of humanity. So what we see is a form that we can comprehend. Our minds kind of mash her into the shape that she’s in so she makes sense to us. (Literally how the true form of Pennywise works, which is hilarious)

Anyways. 

The form they take is like cubism. In cubism artists try to step beyond the theory of forms to represent a subject from as many viewpoints as possible. 

The being we cannot comprehend is smashed into a form that is every possible view of the form itself. The object without form, is represented by being every form. 

That’s a really neat philosophical/art reference I enjoyed. Haven’t seen it mentioned yet. 

Amazing flick. Cried four times. Love jazz. I was doomed from the beginning.",kkbd5s
gslr9kz,"Before I begin this hastily typed ""review"", I will preface with this: I understand that this movie is made for Western audiences, and that it is a kids film. 

Upon finishing the film, I was left wondering whether 22 would have arrived at her ultimate feelings about living if she'd instead had been placed inside the body of a person living in destitution in the slums of, say, a city in India. Statistically, a great number of the souls falling out of the Great Before and down into Earth will end up living in severe poverty, many starving throughout their life. This even applies to many living in New York City. Now, I'm not trying to put down people who live in these situations, and I'm sure many would say that they still enjoy their life overall (everything is relative, right?). However, a single man who had a good upbringing and can afford to live an expensive American city (i.e., Joe) is living a quality of life much better than the quality of life that billions of people experience—Joe's life wasn't a fair representation of what 22 could likely expect living a life on Earth. 

What's my point in writing this all up? Well, I certainly don't consider myself a nihilist or antinatalist, so I'm not trying to say that 22 shouldn't have jumped into Earth. Nevertheless, I think the message of the movie was a little off. Instead of making the moral of the story be that one should simply focus on their journey in life, not the destination (if I'm misrepresenting the moral, please let me know), I think there could have been an acknowledgement that not everybody's going to have a journey in life that affords them the opportunities to enjoy a lot of the nice things Joe does like playing the piano, eating a slice of pie in a diner, have parents who love you, etc., and that perhaps this means that people like Joe **should** have a purpose in life: making the world a better place so that every soul on Earth is actually able to enjoy life in the way that Joe inevitably is able to do. 

Perhaps that's a little too deep for a kids film, but I think they could have incorporated this idea by having Joe realize that his teaching job is a way to influence others' lives in a positive way. Or maybe he discovers that playing live music is an excellent way to bring joy into other people's live. Instead, the message at the end of the film seems very self-centered; Joe is left really only caring about *his* life and *his* enjoyment of it. There's just too much focus on individualism and not enough on what we as humans can do to make sure that everyone's soul maintains that spark that allows them to truly enjoy life. 

With all that said, I recognize that Soul was produced by mega-corporation Disney, and so I could never really see such a message existing in its films.",kkbd5s

gh9wwy8,"You ever just watch a movie, and you know it changed you? Soul did that for me.

The realization that your spark isn't your purpose in life, was by far one of the greatest messages a film has delivered in a long time. Just because you love doing something, that isn't what makes you, you. And I think we can all learn from this and this is by far, one of, if not the, greatest pieces of animation I have seen.

The music, the animation, the humor, and the overall tone of the movie hit all the right places for me, and I will be rewatching this again and again. I loved it and was thoroughly surprised that Mr. Mittens wasn't Joe's cat. I mean, he was apart of every piece of merchandise, I just thought it was funny that he wasn't a bigger part of Joe's life.

Not to mention Dorothea's fish metaphor really stuck with me. Everyone thinks that they'll be happy when they finally get something they don't have, but true happiness comes from where you are now. All that matters in life, is to live every second of it. 

If you love great music, great animation, and a great overall message that you can carry for the rest of your life, go see this movie.",kkbd5s

gs8wd49,"Christ. I went into this movie blind other than “jazz and feelings from music”. 
This movie had NO BUSINESS being this metaphysical. Well, it’s literally the name, so I guess it does lol. 

Straight 10/10 for me. I feel so personally attacked. I have a passion for music, I feel like it’s one of my only “sparks” or will to live. Went through what I thought would be a career but left me feeling suffocated. Music lets you be free from all that. I’m getting close to my 30s and I still feel like I’m so directionless in life. Nothing feels good enough to be called a true path in life. So this movie was spot-on relatable. From Joe’s and 22’s perspective. 

So.. I’ve recently had a.. “metaphysical trip” (lol) and it all came down to.. nameless ants. In a society. Working in a straight line like we’re supposed to do. But some branch out and do what they want as opposed to being a mindless drone. Mine was music. 

I truly FELT what Joe was feeling whenever he played music and got into the zone. The color of his aura was spot on. The fact that you’re just a spirit in the brain of a body is TOO damn deep for a Pixar movie I watched spur of the moment. It plays the metaphysical card SO hard, and so well. It makes you feel.. hopeless, but hopeful. Life. Souls. Purpose. Pixar.

-End Spoilers ahead-
. 
. 
The end of the movie was open for interpretation. I think that’s why I loved it so much. 
It could be the deep Pixar route. One soul finds another soul as a friend. Play the rest of the movie. 
Or it could be perceived as super existential. Joe had an accident, went on life support with drugs. Had a “mental breakdown” or what people would say is just a crazy trip. Had a truly out of body experience and we were there for the insanity and truth. 22 was his inner feelings coming to light and them finding their purpose was also Joe finding his will to live. 

They didn’t prove otherwise.

So I’m happy they kept it open-ended. Provokes the mind into deep thought. And honestly, if a movie can truly accomplish that and make me tune out the rest of the world, it’s a 10/10.

gj5m4ki,"The movie was eh.

I think it's because the set up was weak. The initial conflict came from him finally on the verge of ""making it"" in the business, but we were never there for the struggle and passion. We were simply told for a few minutes that it was his life's spark. Then we're jerked away from it by all of a sudden landing dead in purgatory?

The world of souls also never felt like there was any heart in it. Birth and death are things that inspire spirituality and deep emotions, and I felt like Coco did this beautifully. There was so much detail and color. It took only a glance to feel and see that it was a rich, vibrant world.

In Soul, everything you see feels so plain in comparison. It's an assembly line managed by abstract cosmic beings who randomly assign personalities. While not dealing with birth or death, Inside Out does an excellent job of playing around with deep subjects of loss, transformation, and complex emotion and even lightly touching on concepts we're familiar with: random jingles that play in our heads, dreams, lost memories, trains of thought, abstraction, imagination. Soul does not build this world well at all.

And to skip ahead, after every painstaking effort Joe goes through to play with Dorothea, he just doesn't ""feel it"" anymore? In the beginning of the film, we see him come alive when he plays for his students and at his audition with Dorothea. It's never clear what the relationship was between a newfound appreciation for what we many of us may dismiss or mistake for ""plain living"" and a passionate pursuit of a dream.

The film falls apart at that point for me.

Side note: The land of lost souls was such an interesting topic, and I wish they had given this more loving attention. Becoming mired in doubt and meaningless endeavors or getting lost in ""flow"" can both lead to a loss of connection with the world. This needed more emotion.

(These qualities in themselves actually constitute the grand message of the movie as they shed a lighthearted joyous impression throughout). I think it is also brilliant how our Average ""**Joe!**"" was the one to guide this poor lost soul out of misery. It wasn't any of the great and reputable philosophers and people in history who we typically look to for guidance, but in fact it was within the  life of an ordinary man with a resoundingly familiar problem who ironically by his own fault taught both himself and this soul the great question of life: ""What is the meaning of all this?"" ...

I have enjoyed Pixar movies since seeing the first Toy Story at the theater when I was a kid, but I actually think this might be the best Pixar movie. It's not as funny as some of the others, but by the end of the film I cried so much from how powerful it's messages were that I have watched it about 5 times this week alone. I never re-watch Pixar movies as much as I have with Soul. 

Especially once Joe and 22 are about to perform at The Half Note, and 22 has that realization that she actually enjoys Earth. That music from Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross, John Batiste, and drumming from Questlove thoughout the movie was definitely the best music I have ever heard from Disney, and I got The Lion King soundtrack after seeing the movie in 1994. The music in the Great Before is so beautiful that I felt tears in my eyes. 

Not a lot of movies makes you appreciate the moments you go on a subway and almost get your ass kicked by another passenger.

giiy2rq,"Just watched this movie after a recommendation from my friend to watch it. I was not expecting an adult movie disguised as a kids movie. 

The themes of existentialism and purpose in life were done quite well and it’s something a kid won’t understand. I think all of us who are adults can really relate to someone like Joe. Life is more than just your one passion or your job, it’s about all of the different experiences and making the most of it, such as spending time with family, nature, doing what you love, food, all of the good times you have. You won’t get the most out of life just fixated on your main hobby or job and when things don’t work out, just enjoy it. 

The barbershop scene, the fish in the ocean analogy, Joes flashbacks of his life and his realization that life is about the journey and not the destination were brilliant.

gh6s0hd,"I just read a review on INSIDER on ""Soul"" by Kirsten Acuna. She didn't understand the basic plot points of the movie ([https://www.insider.com/pixar-soul-movie-review-2020-12](https://www.insider.com/pixar-soul-movie-review-2020-12)) and went on berating the movie.

Honestly, her review was so rubbish, and I couldn't help but wonder how did such a rubbish review find a place on INSIDER?

***1. a bratty ""unborn"" soul (Tina Fey) who has the ability to go to Earth, but doesn't want to take the trip because she can't see the point in living.***

22 didn't have the ability to go to Earth because she was unable to find her spark, hence she didn't have an Earth pass and couldn't pass it to Joe. And what Joe did was to help 22 find her spark, so 22 could have an Earth pass, and then the ""ability"" to go to Earth.

***2. In its final moments, ""Soul"" is set to sacrifice its Black lead so a white woman can go and live out her life on Earth. Joe decides he's fine with dying because he was able to live out a dream.***

It was never stated in any way that 22 is a white woman; the author inferred that because 22 is voiced by Tina Fey, a white woman. 22 only ever appeared in the form of a soul, and later in Joe's body; there was no suggestion that 22 was White or a woman. The author inferred that because she knew 22 was voiced by a white female in real life.

I disagree that Joe decided he's fine with dying because he lived out a dream. I think it's the opposite: the Earth pass belonged to 22, it was 22's pass! Joe took it from 22. Joe decided to do the right thing, to give it back to its rightful owner and let 22 experience a life on Earth, instead of taking it away selfishly from 22.

***3. First, Joe is killed the moment he gets his big break within the first 10 minutes of the film. What kind of message does that send to young children watching this film who see themselves in Joe?***

I struggle to understand why any young child would see themselves in a quasi-struggling middle-aged school music teacher. Also, accidents happen in real life. Did the author think young children are too dumb to know that?

***4. Eventually though, ""22,"" predictably, leaves Earth so Joe can continue living. It begs another question: Why does a dying Black man have to help a white woman live?***

Again, where did the author draw a conclusion that 22 is a white woman? 22 didn't leave Earth; they were caught by Terry and were sent to The Great Before.

***5. I wish the film focused and channeled more of its energy into that relationship and Joe's own life rather than his bump in with ""22.***

The author misunderstood the plot. The plot is about Joe's journey leading to the epiphany. There needs to be an inciting incident, and a trigger, that propels him into a journey of getting to the epiphany. Meeting with 22 is a construct, for Joe to understand the relationships (with Joe's Mom, with Joe's barber, with Joe's students, etc.)

**6.** ***Also, Pixar's first Black-led film should celebrate a Black man's experience and solely focus on his dreams and desires. Instead, Joe's life takes a backseat in order for a white woman to figure out what she wanted from life.***

The author misunderstood the movie. The movie does the exact opposite, telling you not to solely focus on dreams and desires, but enjoy the ride. Joe definitely didn't take a backseat for 22 to figure out what 22 wanted. If anything, Joe was using this as a leverage so 22 agreed to help return Joe to his body by preparing for the big night (the haircut, the suits, etc.)",kkbd5s

gh1yt6j,"I think this movie couldn't have come at a better moment. The rush of chasing your talent and doing everything to achieve your ""purpose of life"" was one the main drivers before the pandemic. 

This has some major pitfalls, such as people without a ""talent"", a ""purpose of life"" fall out of society and feel like a stranger, are scared because they won't achieve anything like other people do. Second, if you have a talent, you might go in some sort of overdrive and become one of these dark guys.

The pandemic made it crystal clear that the small things are the things you need to appreciate. Social media is focusing way too much on people with talent and everybody who is not like this, falls out. This movie is finaly a movie that shows that work, or money, or social media status are not the most important things in life. People with almost nothing can be equally happy or even happier than rich, hard working people. The grass is always greener on the other side.

I can't really find much to criticize, honestly. Even though much of the film takes place in a very real looking NYC, the time spent in the Great Beyond/Before, etc. has a lot of great visuals. I loved the design of Jerry/Terry and how they behave on screen. I Thought it was a very creative and unique character design for Pixar. And moments like when Terry pulled characters into The Great Beyond (I think that's what it was, when they were suspended in black and white?) looked amazing. 

But really though, the story, and specifically the message you take away from it is incredibly powerful.

This movie hit hard for me. I lost my older brother in October (my mentor) and it was a story about me jumping in to the world to handle a life without him as a guide. It’s my birthday today, would have been his tomorrow. Glad to have experienced this today.",kkbd5s
gh9dh17,"I like how the movie used sand as the body for the lost souls - once you get buried in it, it's hard to get out from it, like quicksand. And when you get inside (like the scene with 22), it's like a sandstorm - there's a lot of chaos.",kkbd5s
gh9hohf,"There are so many layers to love, its amazing it feels coherent imo. 

The philosophical message and sci-fi like presentation of flow states, memories, etc. was great.

The jazz scenes, music, and animation during the performances were awesome. 

The Trent score in the beyond was amazing.

The 2D-ish style of Jerrys/Terry and the journey to the great before looked so rad.

The photorealism and atmosphere of New York.

There's just so much to love. Super ambitious and somehow a tight and coherent film, thats Pixars MO",kkbd5s
gh9qchj,"Upon first watch thru on Christmas Day I immediately picked up on a familiar tune throughout the Terry sequences of the film that was extremely reminiscent & emoted a strong sense of familiarity, but couldn’t quite put a finger on it upon first watch. The curiosity & urge to know why it sounded so familiar was killing me. But after further examining of the tracks titled ‘Terry Time’ & ‘Terry Time Too’ on the Soul soundtrack, it clicked... 
 Considering the soundtrack was in part produced by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross of Nine Inch Nails for the more electronic/ambient tracks of the film, I presumed the ‘Terry Time’ sequences had to have originated or been inspired by a song from their own catalog... but which song?? 
 So I jumped over to NIN on Spotify & played their top hit ‘Closer’. This immediately solidified my theory. ‘Terry Time’ at its core has the same ascending melody line as ‘Closer’, specifically the ascending synth line starting around 1:26 of ‘Closer’. Playing the two tracks back to back, it’s almost undeniable. Both are even in the same key. ‘Terry Time’ is obviously more toned down, muted & minimal tonally in nature comparatively to ‘Closer’. But this, in my opinion, is a blatant homage to ‘Closer’, the ol’ tip of the hat from Trent & Atticus to their own hit from the 90’s. Although this seems pretty glaring & obvious to me, I’ve combed thru the web & can’t seem to find anyone talking bout it. Anyone else here notice the similarities? Thoughts??",kkbd5s
ghum1f5,"It was a good movie, although the ending did feel like it was missing something. It almost feels like a short film, and not like a full-on Disney/Pixar movie. For the ending,  I don't like that he gets a second chance at life. It's almost like it doesn't fit into the main theme of the movie. He realized from 22 that regular old living was beautiful. Life wasn't about pursuing jazz, it was the little things like being able to get up in the morning, watching the sun through the leaves, pizza.  As viewers, we should get to see more of that reiterated at the end:

&#x200B;

As 22 and Joe are falling towards earth, the camera pans in on the two of them smiling at each other. Sad Pixar style ending music starts playing.

There are flash backs of Joes time on earth as 22 doing silly things, mixed in with parts of Joes life we never got to saw (relationship with dad, others, the girl on the trombome, genuinely happy moments he had that were not related to jazz, shots of regular old living)

On the final note, its a gorgeous shot of  Joe opening his eyes in the morning, and its ambiguous whether its a memory or he gets a second chance - roll to credits C: just my thoughts",kkbd5s
ghwgu0m,"This movie hit super hard and I loved it. 

I've been searching for a bettee teaching job for 7 years now and for some reason continually get shot down at interviews and chances (just like Joe). Then in November I was diagnosed with cancer and I constantly think about my life/purpose/legacy, if things go south.

This movie about getting a second chance to live life appreciatively and not let your career become an obsession but instead a labor of love, really spoke to me.

I enjoyed the ending because the gut punch of him dying when he finally patched things up with his mom and getting his break would have been depressing in a way I don't think would be healthy to a lot of people, even though death is a certainty of life.",kkbd5s

gj7barg,[deleted],kkbd5s
ghccplg,"Loved this movie - the music and animation alone give this a 7/10. The ambitious ideas and hilarious moments bump to a solid 8/10 for me.  My only critiques were:

1. The themes/messaging is a bit heavy handed and too obviously explained (while also jumping around quite a bit from mother/son issues, life and death, teaching versus doing, etc. - each one of those themes can be its own movie)
2. I thought they were building up that teaching/inspiring others was a spark/important theme. For example, it seemed a bit out of character for Joe to ignore Connie's solo on their stairwell early in the movie when he was a cat freaking out. It seemed to be building to that theme but never quite got there

If you are a musician, you will understand just how fucking well done this was. Questlove, Jon Batiste, Trent Rezonor, and Herbie Hancock involved really shows here. The call and response/quoting each other in the performance is so spot on, I was very impressed. I also loved the original score for the escape scene out of the hospital. Reminded me of the music for old showtunes/cartoons but not being too cheesy and having a great modern twist to it. To work that in must have taken so much effort and talent. The music in this movie is what I wished the music in Whiplash *would* have been. Whiplash is held back so much by just some outrageously ridiculous moments and being a movie about music/jazz without knowing anything about jazz/music - anyway, that's aside the point here.

The visualizing of afterlife/personalities and all that stuff was just so fun, funny, and just straight up cool. Definitely felt a lot of emotions during the movie so I think it's up there with some of the best Pixar movies - not quite the best, but definitely worthy of being discussed next to Coco, Toy Story, Up etc.",kkbd5s
ghsuzjx,"Wow - this movie is incredible. Most I’ve felt from a movie in a long time. 

I’m a US millennial and often find myself, as I think many in my generation do, seeking for a greater purpose to live up to. I recognize this is a blessing but it’s also something that can drive you mad or make you over analyze everything at very least. This movie really summed up that living is an incredible thing within itself. My generation gets to enjoy life, can there be anything greater than that?",kkbd5s
gixsgnb,I just don't get why Joe got a second chance to live. I get that it's a movie but it would've been more powerful if he realized that his life was his life. Like why do he get a do-over? We live our lives and that's our life and we don't choose whether when we die. That's ~mindfulness~.,kkbd5s
gjjl4xz,"Was anyone curious about the great beyond? This for me is one of the questions the movie never answers. The old souls are on a conveyer belt leading into the great beyond, which looks like a giant sphere, and whenever any of the souls enter it there is a small “bug zapping” noise. Is anyone curious as to what the great beyond actually is? Is it Heaven? Is it Hell? Is it Limbo? Is it nothing? Is the great beyond literally just a giant recycling machine that breaks down the old souls into energy and then turns that energy into new souls? Is the true existential nightmare that when we die our experiences, our personalities, our feelings, the very essence of everything that we are, gets blasted apart into a million pieces, and then molecule by molecule are reformed into something brand new that isn’t us? Effectively wiping our existence from the universe until nothing of us remains?",kkbd5s
gkkpvhe,"Probably the only movie to actually hit me with its ""life lesson"". As outlandish and supernatural as it gets it still feels very real, very connected. Its not laugh-out-loud funny but honestly i dont even watch movies to laugh. This was crafted to be a piece of art of a movie and it was. The animation, the environment, and the music, oh the music. And as a sucker for piano music this was an awesome experience.",kkbd5s
glnyk1o,"I just finished it and it took me a minute to realize why Connie took up the trombone anyway. 

When Joe is mistaken for the other guy (who and where is he?), 22 thinks it's reverse psychology.

Joe tells the other kids it's great Connie gets into the groove and despite the kind words, she rebuffs him (bringing up her age). 

As 22!Joe talks to Connie, she agrees that she should quit, and Connie goes against him once again (keep at it! ""I'm twelve""; great, quit! ""Uh lemme play first and convince me"").",kkbd5s
gu3ht2y,"Just wanted to mention that ""Lisa"" was probably some lady that Joe never pursued because he was kind of just letting life happen and waiting and waiting... Kind of like that fish swimming in the ""water"" metaphor and dreaming of the sea. My guess is that in his second chance of life he's going to pursue that love interest.",kkbd5s
gi1txam,"Beautiful film. 
I read that a lot of people disliked the ending. Personally, I didn’t mind it, seeing that Joe finally learned what the true “meaning” of life is. By giving him a second chance, he gets to truly live, rather than chasing after false realities. 
Also disney barely kills protagonists, so I wasn’t shocked when he lived",kkbd5s
gh2y3ie,"this movie is amazing, loved it. Only wish we got to see it in the theater. 

This is like the counterpart of Inside out, or the ""WHY"" to its ""What""..and I love it for that.

Favorite scenes has to be the barber shop and his speech to his mother...really great scenes, thought provoking. 

absolutely loved the jazz score as well.

The final line about living life...wow that hit home and the feels hard. Makes me appreciate life a little bit more.",kkbd5s
ghd55bb,I already had a lump in my throat the first time they show Joe playing piano in front of the kids and at so many other moments during the movie. I love the way Jazz is used to tie to the greater theme of not needing to know your purpose. “Jazzing” is referenced often as a shorthand for just sort of winging your way through something and isn’t that what we’re really all doing in life? It’s okay to not know where you’re going next or how you’ll get there.,kkbd5s
ghd5sk0,"I practice mindfulness meditation and work towards being mindful all day everyday, as much as I can. So many aspects of this movie expressed very complex ideas, thoughts, feelings etc. that is exactly what mindfulness is. I study psychology and have been exploring the benefits mindfulness alone has on people, and I’ve got to say that it’s definitely experiencing a rise in western psychology for good reasons. I’ve been working on how to pass the information to people who are new to this in a way that they understand it. I loved and laughed when he met the first “Jerry” and asked who she was. Her explanation is how I feel when explaining the practice. Lol! I think this movie did a great job explaining it in a way that was not only kid friendly, but easy to comprehend for anyone new to this way of thinking. It was also comical and beautifully pictured. Plus, any movie with a hippie named moonwind blasting thru on a sail boat with tie dye sails listening to Bob Dylan automatically catches my attention. 🤪",kkbd5s
gj2vd7s,"As a lost soul myself, I appreciated the depiction of lost souls and how obsession and anxiety can lead to disconnection. The animation itself was beautiful too- looked like it was actually NYC with the designs and details in every scene on Earth

Liked the barbershop scene too! It’s funny how the little moments in the movie made it special which parallels with the theme itself",kkbd5s
gj4cjge,"Personally, I really liked this movie it's not my favorite, but really enjoyed it. I was kinda hoping that Pixar would take a different direction with the story of a jazz musician, something a little more like Ratatouille. But at the end of the day, I really think that this is Pixar's most mature film (theme-wise). I had never seen a film deal with such existential themes as life, death, personality, purpose, and passion like this film does. I think it had some pretty funny moments and it was light-hearted when it needed to be. But the most remarkable scenes to me were the scene in which Joe gets to wear his late father's suit and the montage while he plays the piano. This is Pixar at it's best! These moments are what makes the film so special. In the beginning, I was kinda annoyed at the fact that it reminded me of Inside Out, but they actually balanced out pretty well the time they spent in the Great Before and on Earth. I would have really loved to see more of Joe himself, more of his life, and more about Jazz! Definitely would have loved to see more stuff like the barber scene, those community moments are so dope and I wish they would have been more incorporated in the movie. I feel like the themes are SO deep, that they could never dive into them completely so it kinda leaves you wanting more. But I really love the ending and the montage scene! The ending is so cool because it leaves you kind of in a cliff-hanger, we don't know what will happen to Joe but that's exactly how life is.",kkbd5s

The movie makes you really realize that we get do caught up in the doldrums of life we forget to just enjoy the beauty and joy of life and living. We are so consumed with finding purpose and meaning that we forget the purpose of life is just the experience of life itself and appreciating the simple things around us. Especially in today's busy world. A pretty big parallel to Wall-E if you ask me, but also tried to face on difficult subjects like Inside Out.",kkbd5s
gh1jax5,"I loved it. Watching this and Another Round in quick succession was the greatest tonic I could get to deal with 2020- a bubbling mix of down-to-earth cynicism enveloped with a vivid joyousness and lust for life.

The score was amazing, the animation was amazing and it was pretty funny. Having Joe figure out life as a cat and 22 having Joe's corporeal body was hilarious. And the final act, with >!Joe trying to make it up to 22 and get her to the Earth realm, and Joe being given another chance!< - well, I thought >!Barley reuniting with his dad in Onwards!< was Pixar's most tearjerking scene of the year, but this takes the cake.

My older brother played videogames throughout, my mom tried talking the whole time, and my dad was watching intently until I heard him snoring about an hour in.  I loved it.

Parents who are hesitant but still supportive of your life choices? Check.

Younger folk you've mentored and encouraged going on to do great things? Check.

ig3uvri,"After watching it again for what seems like the millionth time, I'm realizing the subtle undertones of depression that was touched on throughout the film. Of course I was going through depression at the time of release, and although I liked it, I did for the surface level ideas. Now that I'm coming out of my depression, I'm able to receive the message better and it's honestly true. 

I remember I used to wrap my value in my job and career. Now that I'm unemployed due to my mental health literally leading me to self sabotaging behaviors, I'm learning to actually live a life outside of that. I'm starting to build a meaningful life that was different than what I expected my life should go or how it should be. Wrapping your value around a job, skill, or talent to the point where you're obsessed with it will run you down eventually if you don't balance it with the things you love to do.

Overall though, I think this movie had a lot of great ideas but didn’t necessarily explore them as deeply as I would’ve liked. The character of 22 was also a bit thin. They established her (it?) as being extremely difficult to work with but nothing she did or said in the movie really backed that up.

I think the art/designs within the movie were the best part. I guess I mean just the entire animation work as I’m not very familiar with animation. But the designs like “the beyond” were so trippy, reminded me of an acid trip. Just absolutely loved every little thing about this movie. I’ve been thinking about it nonstop for the last day.

When so much seems to be going wrong and we all fixate on the negatives, remembering that life is about living and treasuring the moments of happiness we share is more important than ever. 

As a Pixar film I have to say this felt the least made for younger audiences to date, sure there was some whimsy and colourful design, but the heart of the film felt decidedly geared towards an adult audience. But wow, what a visual feast, from the surreal opening scenes, the beautifully realised NYC, the scenes in the jazz club, and a surprisingly delicate and interesting Trent Reznor/Atticus Ross score. 

10/10 for me, life affirming and joyous and poignant and just magical.",kkbd5s
ghtvxdp,"Incredibly good and mature, definitely not a kids movie. It really has nothing for kids besides 22 being goofy, and even teens will probably find it boring since it's a drama at heart.

But they didn't need to hold back if the target was adults. He should have died at the end in a tear jerker scene, felt like a cop out that Terry just sends him back to life against the rules like a gag scene while the other Terry isn't looking. 
That's not what the movie made me expect so I was like ""Okay?"" and it ends

Really, from the way he obviously had issues accepting that he died in his luckiest day and Terry telling him that death can be abrupt, it totally was building up to him accepting that he could have lived life better but the gut punch would be that he's still dead like it or not.
They even introduced the mentor thing so he could have joined that and help others.",kkbd5s

So after saying goodbye to 22 why is he suddenly heading towards the Beyond because for all intents and purposes he isn't dead, his body is still alive playing piano.

I really enjoyed the scene at the barbershop or when Joe's student comes to his house, plays the trombone and decides not to quit after all. Those moments about community really spoke to me and I loved it. All the cutesy soul stuff was ground they already covered in Inside Out and detracted from the film for me.",kkbd5s

There's so many fantastic scenes of NYC on here.  The view from LIC with the 7 train heading towards Manhattan past the Silvercup Studios sign.  

The jazz clubs, especially, really made me miss the nightlife since I swing / blues dance to live music and that's where I spent most of my time off.  I have a lot of friends who are musicians that I miss seeing perform. 

The subway scenes!  My favorite was the one with the busker...There are some damn good musicians busking here and I miss seeing them in my day to day.

The business of the sidewalks...I may have a love / hate relationship with it, but Joe telling 22 he can't just stop made me laugh.  I had the very same thought. lmao.",kkbd5s

From an audience point of view it makes sense that the main character doesn’t end up dying. From an emotional impact/ usual Pixar film point of view it didn’t do as much as it did with other Pixar films for me. It’s different in that sense but I feel like it’s too “ohohoh he went back to life isn’t that swell”. It would’ve made much more of an impact if he really just accepted the fact that he died. Just my opinion though, it’s probably not that important anyways lol. Movie overall is great, I’d say a 8/10 or 7.5/10",kkbd5s
i86pzl1,"Beautiful animation and story. A thought provoking film.

I think my favourite moments of the movie was 22 in Joe's body and how present and in the moment she was and how the viewer (and Joe cat) slowly start to see that Joe's jazz obsession had had unintended negative consequences in other parts of his life. I also like how the problem wasn't jazz for Joe, in fact music and jazz were incredibly important in Joe's life. It was that he had obsessed and gambled his happiness on his success as a jazz musician. In turn, he had missed out on the life that had been happening around him. He hadn't paid full attention to his teaching job even though it's evident he had connected with some of the kids he taught. He framed his mother's advice to take the permenant position at the school in a negative light but only later realised that there was more depth and concern from her answer; she wants him to have some stability for him after seeing him struggle with many gigs that interfere with what she sees as another good career path (teaching), she realises she is old and can't support him forever and she knows the tough realities of being a musician (Joe's dad). He also misses out on relationships: his relationship with his barber is lacking the human connection that 22 brought out in her willingness to ask him questions other than jazz; he doesn't take into mind 22's view and uses her as a means to get his goal and therefore misses the awe and wonder of her experiences on Earth; he misses out on romantic relationships that are hinted (Lisa).

Overall the film speaks about slowing down a little and enjoying and being present in the smaller moments in life. It's also about everyone's unique life journey and understanding and appreciating that (e.g. 22's frankness with Joe's mum has the unintended consequence of revealing her thoughts and emotions around her actions even if it initially causes some tension - in turn Joe realises that his label of 'failure' has been given to him by himself and that his mum is mostly driven through care and support of him). I feel like by the end of the movie Joe will be ready to have better relationships, he'll be more open and more willing to reciprocate, he'll find joy in the smalller moments of life and not just the grander ones like his moment on stage. I think ultimately this will let Joe have more fulfillment in life, regardless of what he chooses to do at the end of the film.",kkbd5s
gj705dn,"The ending, with Joe being given a second chance, feels like a cheat to me (as if they weren’t brave enough to stick with a resolution that’s totally earned, maybe fearing the film would be perceived as too depressing). Because the character totally gets the epiphany that his life was not in vain and was made to appreciate the small moments that made it worth it. It's not a great movie (it has a great concept, but a so-so execution IMO), but it would definitely be elevated by a more courageous approach.",kkbd5s

gh4w0c6,"I loved the film's depiction of NYC, jazz, and how it's really the small things/moments of connection in life that make life worth living. The jazz scenes were my favorite, truly captured the energy of being in a jazz club and watching someone nail a solo (or playing music yourself). 

I wondered if the metaphysical aspects would be too much for children. There was a lot of kind of intense content about death in there. But - loved the joke about too many narcissistic personalities being made",kkbd5s

gh1lgnk,"So this is straight up a Pixar movie for adults and that’s beautiful. Admittedly there was some moments that dragged in the first 2/3rd despite some great comedic moments (the Knicks joke had me dying). It took a huge step after the show. Of course immediately after that was the traditional “get me to cry like a fucking baby” with that incredible dialogue free sequence at the piano. They way they were able to have the emotional climax that furthered the story and showed they whole lesson of the movie in one go. Masterful. Even if this isn’t in my personal top 5 Pixar, that moment is. Really the overall focus on the importance of teaching and mentorship was a beautiful message. As well as finding the spark that makes you want to live

Other things: 

- Great voices cast for the supporting characters. Rachel House (one again in pursuit of a troublesome duo in the name of law and order), Richard Ayoade, Daveed Diggs, Wes Studi, Phylicia Rashad, and of course Angela Bassett all great. 

- loved the somewhat ambiguous ending. I would guess he’s going back to teaching, but it is possible that he decided to join the band. 

- the animation was completely insane. Not just the earth stuff and how well the animated NYC. The afterlife bridge with the white void and the stuff in the pre life area was stunning. I have a good set, but that really made me wish I was able to watch it in theaters. 

- Reznor and Ross’s score was beautiful. The piece at the piano and when they’re falling to earth together being the stand outs. 

- very strong Don Hertzfeldt vibes throughout the movie. Especially with Jerry and Terry. 

- huge huge props for trusting the audience to understand the themes and moral of the movie without spelling it out completely. 

Overall it cracks my Pixar top 10, but not my 5. Edit: it’s number 6 on the strength of the final act.",kkbd5s

Sometimes I feel like walking is the only thing I'm good at too.

I didn't love every part of this film but the message is very good and I'm glad they didn't just stop at, ""Everyone has a purpose if you look hard enough."" No one belongs anywhere. Life is random. Go watch some TV with your family and enjoy what you're given.

And I loved how they didn't need to make heartbreak as a way to tug on our heart. It cut me really hard when Joe laments ""what next?"" when he finally reaches his goal, not knowing that he has already reached the sea.

I also thought it was brilliant how they used Joe's pieces were played. When he first auditioned, we can feel his heart and soul (hehe) poured into the music. But when he finally reached the performance, he played a great piece to go with the quartet, but you can feel as if his heart isn't there. And when he played one more time as he came home, that's when my tear ducts just flooded. He reached the top, but he came there lonely.

Especially the discussion of a singular purpose vs. the purpose of solely living to be alive and take in all the beauty in the world.

I don't know how but this hit me harder than Coco, and I was an absolute mess during that. I just see so much of myself in Joe. 

I still think Coco might be the better overall movie, but this definitely ranks among the best Pixar films.",kkbd5s
gh9oedm,"I really loved this movie and it had me questioning the importance of my life. As most others have agreed, this movie has alot of mature concept and this could quite possibly go over children's heads. The brilliance I thought was the strongest point was the switch-swap of the joe and 22 souls into different bodies. Joe see's and begin to see a different perspective (ironically in a physical way) of his life while 22 lives his from the interactions of others who know Joe that makes him questions the importance of the way he lived his. While 22 begins to conclude a realization as to why they living on earth is well worth living.

22's previous mentors that told them (even though the voice is feminine I believe there is no associated gender of any soul in the great before) they were a trouble maker and wouldn't really amount to anything for thousands of years and create an isolating ideology about the way they view the world. This ideology is slowly broken by the experiences and interactions in Joe's body with the interaction of people and reactions towards the environment.

22's interaction with the trombone girl in questioning about her decision to drop trombone only to find they don't want like drop the trombone give 22's the an new understanding  that you can like something and have a passion for something without questioning the need of as to why you like it. A lesson Joe mentioned early was slowing being understood by 22.


From both these character's newly developing perspectives, 22 learned to appreciate not just the little things in life but life as an experience and just simply being alive. Their perspective is totally changed by the end of the day. This is realized by Joe during a self reflection moment after playing the gig of his life when he see the things 22 kept in Joe's pocket. He questions his motivation in the ways of what did it amount too and the importance of what his life actually meant to himself.

Joe was so blinded for his one greatest desire in life that he neglected the little things in his life that emote to purpose were just as important (if not more), which I believed was simply enjoying the present of what life gives while you attempt to reach a meaningful purpose. 

It was only realized through 22's response to their environmental responses and interactions with other with Joe's body did he understood. The barber wanted to a veterinarian by but due to family matters and priorities he became a barber. However, even though he wanted to be a veterinarian, it didn't stop him from enjoying the things he does as a barber. Doing something different in life from your dream goal doesn't necessarily take away associated purpose or joy of life.

However, while Joe's passion was the determinating motivation was his passion for jazz and ultimately the big gig, he has a self reflecting moment that is never spoken but is emoted into his passion for music (a really beautiful scene). The viewer is not exposed to Joe's passion but the key moments of where he lived for the sake of living and not simply for a purpose or driven goal. Through good times with family, enjoying life through bike rides, and even mouring loved ones.

The way Joe's mother cares about his well being for having a stable job instead of relying on gig work (a non-stable income) because of they way it affected Joe's father also gave a good perspective in The burden it took on Joe's mother while his Dad's idolized passion for music. It gave a sense that Joe has a well established life from a story standpoint  but also a conflicting one where he's driven by passion and not by his awareness (which is ironically how he died to begin with).

There were so many life lessons to take from this movie and self reflect from as viewer that it definitely questioned the importance of life goals/purpose vs simply living from my view. Life has no definitive meaning. It's okay to be driven by goal as most people are and it's also okay to not have any sort of definitive goal as well. There is no right or wrong way to live life. Living life can give anyone a joyful purpose but we determine whether we hold our reasons for life in high regards or not through the perspective we live, for just simply living can amount to joyous reason.",kkbd5s
gha4fqs,"The Mr. Mittens thing confused me. It seemed like the cat died which is how Joe was able to take its body. We even saw the cat’s soul ascending to the great beyond. But after Joe was booted from its body, it was alive again?",kkbd5s
ghd4z0a,"I'm really blown away. Beautiful music, gorgeous visuals, and a really ambitious story. It felt very similar to Inside Out at times, but more philosophical. I really love how they were ultimately pretty ambiguous about what Joe learned. We know he learned that a spark is not a purpose, and that he needs to stop waiting for life and start living it, but they still left some things unknown - does he continue playing with Dorothea? Does he focus solely on teaching? Does he do both?

We don't know, and we don't need to - Joe learned that he finds meaning in both of these areas, and that spending his time on those things is meaning*ful*. 


I definitely put this around the top tier of Pixar films.",kkbd5s
ght6b8y,"Loved the jazz, loved some of the interpretations of things like lost souls and the zone, but I felt like this movie needed to just slooooow down at times and just let things marinate.

gh5oh3g,"First off, Disney really held off when it came to the marketing of this film. It really went places I didn't expect. Second, this is definitely a more abstract and out-there concept for a kids' movie than usual. ""What is the meaning of life?"" essentially. I wonder what kids might get out of this?

As a budding college artist, this movie really resonated with me. Maybe it's okay to be pulled by two different passions, unsure of which path to take.

And *my god* Pixar knocks it out of the animation park again with this movie! Those Earth environments, clothing, and character designs were gorgeous! Made me cry twice in this film because of the beauty. And the behind-the-scenes extras about crafting such an abstract and unexplainable world such as the afterlife was also really cool!

gh71gdo,"By the way, I read a few comments that said 22 is a White woman. This is plainly incorrect. The conversation between Joe and 22 at the beginning was:

*Joe: ""by the way, why do you sound like a middle-aged white lady?""*

*22: ""I don't. This is all an illusion.""*

*Joe: ""Huh?""*

*22: ""This whole place is a hypothetical. (in male voice) I could sound like this if I wanted to. (in kid's voice) Or sound like this instead. (in normal voice) I could even sound like you. (in Joe's voice) Life is so unfair. I don't wanna die. Somebody call the wambulance. Wah! (in normal voice) I just use this voice because it annoys people.""*

The exploration of black culture was really nice as was the exploration of jazz. 

Music was excellent, both the live jazz parts, and the Trent Reznor background music. 

I really enjoyed the ending. Not knowing where 22 ends up was nice because we can decide ourselves what they would become. Also, letting Joe, who throughout the movie learns all these new things about people he has known for years, to have a second chance, a second life with these same people was a nice touch. 

Why let Joe go to the great beyond and not get to live this newly discovered life? I mean for most of it, he was a damn cat!

gij03xs,"I've been hearing great things about this, but I wasn't expecting to love it this much. The animation was amazing. It was so incredibly detailed and realized that it bordered on photorealistic sometimes. The people and New York looked so incredibly real. The designs were also great, especially the Jerry's and Terry. The lost souls also had great designs.

The soundtrack was amazing as well. I liked the mixture of Jazz and techno-music. Really interesting combination.

I really liked the message of the movie. It seems a lot of people interrupted it differently, but for me, it was kind of a optimistic nihilism. Life may have to real purpose, or a moment where you finally achieve ""fulfillment"", but the journey itself is full of life-affirming moments, many of which we probably don't even realize or think about.

It's not my favorite Pixar movie ever, I don't think it quite has the grand world building and emotional rollercoaster (at least for me) that some of other films have had.

gh874p2,"Well, I guess they've done it. Pixar has figured out the meaning of life and they've put the answer into movie form. I always knew they were 'gods of animation' but never took the whole God thing literally... until now. 

Joking aside, this is absolutely beautiful. Not only is it a love letter to Jazz, but it's a love letter to life. To finding one's purpose, and realizing life is worth living. The story is fun, exciting, hilarious in some parts, and like most Pixar movies, extremely touching. I loved all the characters they all feel fleshed out, and the imagination of it is incredible. 

I think it's the little details too that make me appreciate the film even more. They really nailed what New York City is like. From the look of the metro pass, to the detail of the streets– it's all there.

I think there is some faint resemblance to Inside Out, though I 100% enjoy this movie more. But I think some people may find that distracting and think Pixar is treading familiar ground (I don't agree with this really). It also is probably a little too infantile? Like maybe a little too happy and positive? I think for some, life really isn't enjoyable. It's a very big topic and because this movie was made for everyone, I don't blame it for taking such a positive approach to everything. But it does kind of tie it all in a bow, without some of the nuance that life actually brings. I hope I explained that right? 

I still love the film though and I think it's a piece of art. The animation is incredible, so is the music. This is a love letter to life and no doubt Pixar's most mature entry of their filmography. This will win best animated feature no doubt and I honestly think it deserves to win best picture. Great movie to show aliens to show the best side of humanity.",kkbd5s

It's also super cerebral. So while I found it scintillating and thought-provoking, I didn't feel moved by it. However, my sister who is a very experiential person compared to me found it very moving.

ghqgikt,"I wanted to love this movie, but it didn’t quite hit all the marks for me. 

Don’t get me wrong. I still think this is a pretty good movie. It goes above and beyond what you’d see in a typical Pixar film. But something about it just doesn’t resonate with me as much as other films. And no, it’s not the abrupt ending, which works well enough I think. 

If I had to put my finger on it, I think the story structure was a bit off. The movie sends out the message that it’s okay to just live life. You don’t have to focus on just one thing, you don’t have to be consumed or defined by a single purpose. This is all well and good, but I don’t think the story cemented it well enough. It almost felt like the film was building up towards Joe accepting his death and/or becoming a mentor, but this was changed at the last minute. And it’s fine that the movie didn’t head in that direction. Makes it less predictable and preachy, but to me, it felt like there was less of a pay off. I didn’t feel satisfied. But maybe that’s the point. Still, I think that with some tweaks to the story, the ending could have resonated much more strongly with the audience and really hammer in that message they wanted to send. A longer run time would have also helped solidified things, I feel. 

I’m glad this movie has resonated with and helped out so many. I wished it did for me, but it didn’t. And that’s okay. Still a good film. The art and animation departments, in particular, deserve a raise. The voice acting and music were top tier too.",kkbd5s

Lol. I had no idea who the actors were behind the characters.

I really feel like this movie had the opportunity to be great for kids who may have experienced loss at a young age when it can be so difficult to process.

Isn't it strange to leave the education(??) of the souls on the hands of a company? I thought the movie explained how the soul is something essential (no soul->no birth). If Pixar was going for a ""neutral"" thing...is a corporation the new neutral?

You could say that it's just a way for the mentors to understand how it's organized. But if that's the case, why would the Jerrys gaslight Terry at the end? Or why would Jerry have the authority to take the trophy from Terry??

gh6n9xn,"So I personally loved it, I think its one of the better Pixar films, I will have to rewatch to find its place, but its pretty high up.

I loved the intro, and was a bit worried of the thematic change when he went into the afterlife, but it all came back together nicely.

Few thoughts I had during the watch.

\- The scene at the end where he plays the piano hit me bang in the feels. Pixar at its best.

\- if you told me 20 years ago that Trent Reznor would score a Disney cartoon I woulda laughed in your face.

\- The visualisation of depression and burnout that you see while on the pirate ship is so beautifully spot on, and also the imagery of being present and still as enriching your soul. You can just tell how much work they did with psychologists and sufferers. Incredible work.

\- Love their bravery of focusing a film on a single middle aged man for a cartoon. I'm guessing its been done many times before, but it just felt very brave for a Disney film. Also I appreciate the fact it was authentically black, without being in your face about it. 

\- the bit where the guy from the barbershop got jumped in the alleyway was pretty dark

I fully expected it to end with Joe realising that it was entirely okay for him to not have achieved anything of note before actually passing on. While I'm still on-board with the *It's a Wonderful Life* type ending, it does almost feel to me like it pulled a punch I guess, especially with Jerry appearing at the last moment.

I dunno, maybe that would've been a bit too much of a downer to end on.",kkbd5s
ghd7diz,"Pixar sometimes includes details referencing the geographical area where the movie is played.   


I saw this movie in Singapore, and it seemed that 22's soul was going towards China. Out of curiosity: Was this the same for people who watched it in the US, or anywhere else in the world?

gh1sq7e,"I’ve seen a couple people saying this didn’t resonate much with them, but this one really or me deep down. For a long time I’ve been measuring my value by my successes in my career. Chasing rung after rung on the ladder of what I want my life to be, comparing my successes to the achievements of others, and each time I achieve something for myself that I was aiming for, I’ve felt that empty feeling. Joe’s “what’s next?” moment. 

His arc was painfully relatable to me, and for those who didn’t think so I’m very jealous. It sounds like you’re already living and enjoying life right. 

Story aside, it was absolutely gorgeous. Top notch art directing and character design. As much as I enjoy movies like Coco and Up with fairly standard character animation it’s so nice to see a studio like Pixar kicking out movies with unique art styles that set them apart.",kkbd5s

gh4b8s5,"i feel like in the past decade or so, pixar has leaned into a sort of predictable style of animation in their films. i expected this film to follow suit, but soul really showed us something new and creative.

the animation style of the characters in 'the great before' really floored me. the fluid, glowing lines of the jerrys and terry were so gorgeous and artistic; parts of it didn't feel like disney/pixar at all, which i loved. there was also the absolutely stunning animation of nyc (a city i love), and that one part with the collage of all these small moments that bring you peace in life which really, really resonated with me. it made me think about how the purpose of life is to just... live. and that hit home harder than i expected it to, especially after this year.

i went into this film with very low expectations, and it was way more touching and beautiful and existential than i expected. what a lovely film to watch on xmas. or anytime, really. i definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone.

this film was a reminder that life is not just the big, burning passions and the true calling so many of us search for, but also the small things, like sunlight coming through the orange leaves in the fall, or the sting of saltwater air and sand between our toes. and those small things, however small they might be, may be worth living for.",kkbd5s

gh2tvbr,"I really appreciate how they left Joe's ending ambiguous in regards to what he intended to do with his 2nd chance at life, as well as what 22's spark turned out to be, and what her life on Earth would be like.

There were some hints and it would've been *very* easy to try and give a canonical ending to what Joe could/would do when he returned (i.e. the feel-good route to give up on the gig life to take the teaching job afterall to inspire new musicians, etc). But they made a great choice in deciding to hold it back here and really reinforce the message: that the ""spark"" isn't a purpose but rather the joy you find in living a life, regardless of what you do.

That's why we don't need to see what 22's life turns out to be or what her spark was, that's why we don't need to see what Joe ends up doing: it doesn't matter. What does matter is that we see our 2 protagonists find their ""spark"" for living.

gh1l9qy,"I give Soul an 8/10. I liked it, didn’t love it. Aesthetically impressive, and arguably the most mature Pixar film out there. 

The biggest issue I had with the movie though, is Joe Gardner. I didn’t really connect with him at all. A central message of the story is LIVING LIFE. Just because you have a talent for something, or love to do something, doesn’t necessarily mean you are LIVING. Living is more than that, it’s moment moment, day by day, in many aspects of life. 

And Joe at the end, promises to “live”. The thing is, we don’t ever really see him “not living”.  He ends up in the hospital like 10 minutes into the movie. He gets his dream job very early on, and we don’t really see him not living moment to moment. 

I think I would’ve been able to connect with him more, if it devoted some time in the beginning, showing him actually coasting through life. He comes home and sits on the couch and watches tv until he falls asleep after playing hours of piano. A stranger outside tries to spark a conversation with him, and Gardner brushes him off. He always orders take out from the same place and never goes to different restaurants and tries different foods. 

Just simple things like that. I’d like to have seen him being overly structured, pretty reclusive, refusing to be open to people and his environment, and only cares about playing the piano, going to his job, then playing piano some more, without making space and time for much else. I think if I saw him live life like that at first, it would’ve made me feel for him more at the end. The impact of him promising to live each moment and be more alive, would’ve been more profound imo. 

Also..that Knicks joke. I can’t remember the last time a Pixar joke made me laugh so hard. You know it’s bad when a freakin Pixar movie roasts you.",kkbd5s
ghaxmxl,"Excellent! Beautiful, funny, wonderfully paced and life affirming. Perhaps the studio’s best work since *Ratatouille*. Can we take the time to appreciate all the things the script *doesn’t* do that a lesser movie would? It doesn’t do some kind of contrived ticking-clock setup for artificial tension as a few more recent Pixar movies have done. Okay, it sort of does, but it’s low stakes and doesn’t cramp the pacing. Likewise, the movie doesn’t do the cliche “Oh no, my jazz performance and my student’s trombone recital all are at the same time!” thing. No villains or obvious antagonists. It ends exactly when it needs to. The characters don’t coincidentally meet up in the mortal world and it leaves their futures totally open-ended. In a world where every big movie I see these days feels bloated and overlong, this was refreshingly tight and efficient.",kkbd5s
ghw9sth,"I see a lot of people saying that they wish they could've seen Joe and/or 22 living life on Earth, but I disagree. Showing his life afterwards would've diminished the message - that no one thing on Earth makes up someone's whole ""purpose,"" and one's purpose (or supposed lack of one) shouldn't affect one's approach to life. We really didn't need to see Joe enjoying his life - we already knew that, and leaving it up in the air for the viewers to imagine for themselves just made more sense given the movie's message.",kkbd5s

gjb1xoa,"I'm not sure what it is about jazz as the symbolic genre for love and life in movies but I can't seem to get enough of it. La La Land, Whiplash, and Soul use jazz and its many nuances to represent theatrical themes with staggering success. Though of course, in Soul the many technicalities of what makes jazz so great is passed on to talk more about *ahem* soul and passion. But I'm not complaining. If more movies want to come along and bring in more jazz I'm all for it. And I don't usually listen to jazz all too often.

As for my thoughts on the movie; I think it's brilliant. Jamie Foxx, Tina Fey, Graham Norton, Rachel House, every actor that spoke anything in this film was perfect. Excellent voice work, great dialogue, perfect sets of humor, and of course outstanding animation and visual work.

In regards to the story; it seems to line up with my expectations quite well. I can see for the people who criticize it the most they were looking for a more single character focused film where Joe rediscovers his passion for music again after a near-death experience. And it's probably because of the trailer. Oh well.

Overall I'd give this movie a 9/10 or 9.5 even. If I was to give any constructive criticism it's that it could've been a little bit longer. Especially the part where Connie visits Joe for her lesson, plays a beautiful song, reconciles herself and then leaves. It also should've been made more clear that maybe Joe wasn't worried about Connie actually quitting because he knows she always rediscovers her love for music after playing again. In the movie it made it seem like Joe was just being selfish when in reality he's not really like that.",kkbd5s

gi2i29o,"Watched this movie with no prior knowledge of it other than it was about jazz music. Some of the best movies I’ve seen are because I knew nothing about them going in and this one is no exception.

I was blown away with the movies depictions of the before/after life and the visualization of self doubt and loathing. I’m not sure if I was supposed to, but I found deeper meaning in this movie in regards to themes like depression(and suicide by extension) that at times could have brought me to tears if I had let it.",kkbd5s
gh3u5k2,"This film may have come from the people at Disney and Pixar but it is as far from being just a kids film as a movie could possibly be, Soul is a deep dive into serious philosophical areas and this isn't something you'd expect to see in a story that would seem to be aimed at kids. *Inside Out* tried to tackle some interesting ideas about the human condition but then it decided to settle on a standard formula, on the other hand, you have Soul which actually challenges the viewer to think about their own life and how they are living it. This is a powerful film and should be seen by anyone who has ever questioned *""What am I supposed to be doing with my life?""*",kkbd5s

gh4dp3d,"I think Pixar should consider making some films that are purely for adults. I think the medium is more than mature enough, audiences are open to watching animation with deeper themes, but more than that I think the films are suffering for having to cater to younger audiences. I thought this with Wall E and I thought it again here, the meat of this story was in Joe's interactions with the world and the childish aspects of the spiritual world detracted from that.

I thought the film was alright but predictable, and while there were scenes that I thought were very spiritual, almost transcendent (those where Joe was at a piano) they happened too infrequently for me - I would have liked his relationship with music to have been the focus of the film and have that really be explored, rather than his perception of his life.",kkbd5s

A quote from Pablo Picasso came to mind when my family and I were watching the movie: “The meaning of life is to find your gift, the purpose of life is to give it away”

Not sure if the creators of the movie had that in mind but I thought it was funny that all the Gerrys (not sure the spelling) all looked like some of Picasso’s art styles",kkbd5s
gh54bmu,"I like the concept of learning to live life each day, etc... the issue I have is based on childrens perspective... my husband passed away at 42, leaving behind me his wife and our 3 yr old daughter. She has gone thru the grieving process at each turn of maturity..so several times in her life. From the start I told her her father was dead, he's gone. I never said he was ""sleeping"" or any other bullshit that confuses kids. I did this along with a therapist, which was the smartest thing I ever did for my kid. This movie can cause and or add to confusion of death for kids. They do think deeply, grieve deeply..any movie that shows a person dying, but then for some reason is able to come back to life, is so incredibly confusing and heartbreaking for kids that know the loss of a loved one. Especially if it's because the person that died in the movie did some deed that grants them back to life. My kid saw a movie that did that and asked ""was dad not able to do something right so he could come back?""
Trying to tell a kid that ""it's just a movie, that can't really happen"" is heart wrenching.. they don't get it... they understand it's a movie, but in their head, it must be based on something real? 
Every time my kid went thru another set of grief stages, I went thru this..
I just think perhaps they should have thought about another way to end the movie.. maybe Joe still dies, but by sending 22 to earth, he goes to heaven and lives life there? I don't know.. I only know coming back to life?  Sends kids that know loss, and heart wrenching message that their loved one wasn't good enough to come back.",kkbd5s

gh9vecn,"This movie has a lot to talk about and does it's best in the space it has -- but my emotional response to this movie was much stronger than I thought it would be.

For years now, I have always understood and practiced the fact that life is the experiences that we have, big and small ever since being in a production of ""Our Town"". So I went into this film thinking that the entire message of the movie wouldn't surprise me, and just reassure my views.

I was not at all expecting the whole concept that your passion alone does not amount to your life as a whole. 

I've been at a low point recently. I was a senior in highschool really diving into my passion for theatre when covid hit. It left me feeling like I suddenly woke up in a world that wasn't my own, at a different school with different people. I couldn't figure out what was wrong, because I am now in college pursuing theatre and succeeding from a technical standpoint. Straight A's. Every day was focused on training and learning and doing the thing I loved so much -- but it felt like routine and felt empty. I started to question if it was really theatre that I loved, or that specific set of circumstances I had in highschool where I could make friends who I would continue to act with for four years. Was this really the only thing I had to live for? Or did I really feel alive because of the people around me, making performing feel-- worthwhile. Sharing myself and creating something together with people I care about. 

I thought that I could solve all my problems by moving my education internationally -- to finally ""start living"" if I am able to wake up somewhere cooler than where I am now.

I think this movie made me realize that -- while it's my choice to make these decisions that will give me more opportunities -- etc. etc. (Joe performing was never shown as a BAD thing, it was just displayed as not the ONLY thing there is to life) I can't expect it to solve all my problems.

The woman who played the sax summed it up really well after that performance -- not with her anecdote about the fish -- but her mentioning something along the lines of ""After 100 shows, one really stands out"".

That really clicked to me -- this whole time I've been expecting myself to feel the high I've felt when under the stage lights 24/7 -- dismissing any other form of neutrality because THIS is what I am passionate about so why should I feel anything differently about it? ""This is what I do -- this is who I am""  -- dismissing how simply sitting on the floor before class with a Starbucks made me feel just as happy and full. 

He expected himself to feel different. This was the night of his life after all -- and it was clear that he had been living up until then. As an artist, honing in everything he has perfected and loved through his life, he expects to feel that high and ride it out for the rest of his life but that's not the reality of it. It's the faulty idealization of passion and success. 

While a movie is a movie, and is human and capable of coming up with its own philosophies -- I have taken this to heart.",kkbd5s
ghae1mz,"This movie was absolutely breathtaking. I wish I had watched this before WW 84. 

I loved the idea of your spark being more than purpose or talent. I always get hung up on t doing enough. It sends me into a self loathing spiral leaving me unmotivated. I have to remember that the quiet moments are just as important as the loud ones.

ghgotbn,"Weirdly, for a Pixar movie, I did not cry even once in the movie. But I thought this was up there with the best of Pixar. Beautiful story and great voice acting.

Animation was incredible, the world which was created was done with a lot of attention paid to the small things. Great repeatability.

I loved Terry's voice actor. And I did not even realise that Moondream was Graham Norton! That was a clever casting choice.

This is an absolute 9/10 movie.",kkbd5s
gh5f11w,"Insider wrote a review of this movie that criticized it for making the black main character take a back seat to a white character in a movie advertised as the first Pixar movie with a black lead. They went on to suggest that the movie would have been better if it focused less on 22 and more on Joe’s connection with his parents, and further complained that it’s a bad move to kill the lead character ten minutes into the movie.

I definitely disagree with that last criticism, but I’m wondering if the fact that I’m white is preventing me from taking the other criticisms as seriously. I loved the movie and thought it was gorgeous. Does anyone who isn’t white have thoughts on the movie or the Insider review?",kkbd5s

The last half of the movie absolutely wrecked me. The piano scene alone would've been worth it to see it in theaters. Trent reznor and atticus ross created such a perfect soundtrack. 

Loved the ending, even though i thought it was gonna go a different and more darker route. I liked how it wasn't just about the beauty of life but also the reality and acceptance of it.

It's been a tough time in life and this film really arrived when it was needed. Easily in my top 3 pixar movies.",kkbd5s

Of course the abstract world was also every bit as visually accomplished and interesting, formed and formless at the same time, dimensionless but still seemingly rounded and squishy. 

Putting those two side-by-side and layering it on top of a story about passion, life and purpose, with a jazz undercurrent. Top shelf stuff.

When he initially died I was really worried that it would be another Inside Out and try a little too heard to he profound (my opinion), but it was such a good look into the human experience. I lost all of my work due to COVID this year (events industry), and this movie is practically written for people in my position. 

I really liked the few parts that showed how little self awareness Joe had throughout his life. The barber shop, looking back at his life museum thing, really makes you think how we distort out own memories to make ourselves feel better about our own lives. 

Finally, I think this may have been Pixar's most cinematically ambitious movie so far, and it's *such* a shame its the one that had to be released on streaming. 

There's a lot to chew on here.",kkbd5s

I've been really annoyed by the unnecessary dialogue in Pixar movies of the last decade, and instead of just beating Joe's realization down our throats and over-explaining it, they use a very effective and beautiful visual sequence that allowed the audience to think.

Reminded me of the Ratatouille/Wall-E/Up era where they didnt lean heavily on dialogue.",kkbd5s
gi0ytpp,"So I feel like I really related to 22 the most (funnily enough I just realised I am 22 years old too lmfao what a coincidence), the whole being so cynical and hating the idea of doing anything and scared to just try to the point that I end up just doing nothing and get trapped in a cycle of self hatred, anxiety and feeling like life isn’t worth living.

If the answer is to enjoy the little moments, which I feel like I knew on paper, how do I like, do that? Often times the little moments don’t actually give me joy like they did when I had that childlike wonder of everything being new like it was for her when she was on earth. I’m just too caught up in my head and can’t appreciate them. I wish I could appreciate my life a lot more but often it feels like there’s not much to appreciate and the little moments don’t really mean much to me even if I try stop and appreciate them as they come.",kkbd5s

This is a masterpiece that I don’t even want to call a ‘children’s’ film because it’s literally for anyone and everyone who’s ever questioned their role in the world.

My favorite part of the movie was when as Joe gave his earth pass to 22, she said, ""But that means you'll.."" and he replied, ""I know, I already did."" This was such a huge step forward for Joe because he said that his life was about to start after playing with Dorothea Williams. After playing, I don't think he still felt his life hasn't started. Then, when he had an Epihphany (also the name of the soundtrack where Joe reflected on his life), he finally realized that he had been living all this time, he just forgot to appreciate it.

Man, this was such a great movie and was released at the right time. We had a rather interesting year, and there's still a lot of questions for 2021. Nevertheless, let's live every minute of it

Edit: Corrections for quotes",kkbd5s
ghccwu5,"Movie had some sweet moments, but overall felt uneven in its messaging.

It felt like the scene in the barbershop setup the idea that, on some level Joe was a lost soul, obsessing over his desire to get his shot in the music business, at the cost of ignoring his personal relationships.  It felt like it was setting up an ending where he doesn't get ""in the zone"" to save 22 by playing music, but instead he gets ""in the zone"" interacting with his students and teaching them music.  Like, he learns from his experience guiding 22 that he really enjoys teaching and mentoring.  Instead the movie just kind of abandoned those plot threads.

Still a pretty decent movie.",kkbd5s
ghdcfx1,"Looked amazing and the music was great. But I just feel it lost so much of its point towards the end. I mean, what’s the actual message? He was too focused on the dream of being a musician he forgot to appreciate life? I feel it’s trying to be too deep and missed the mark.",kkbd5s

I obviously don’t expect movies to parent my child, and I’m not afraid of deconstructing movies with children (I’m a middle school teacher and typically do a lesson on bioethics), BUT if I were a young kid that just had a close relative die(like from COVID-19 for instance) and was presented with the possibility that my loved one died just because they didn’t choose to or fight hard enough to come back to Earth, I’d really struggle with that.

Overall though, a beautiful piece of entertainment. I also really liked how in the ""Musem of Life"" we saw Joe sitting all alone and sad in cafe, but then near the end he remembered that moment fondly. What I liked is the quick line by 22 that this is him who set up all those scenes in the museum, so we saw it from his perspective back then.

Also, LMAO at all the comments that are like ""Would've been great if after a whole movie teaching about enjoying life they would've just killed MC"".

Though it would be awkward if 22 gets born as a person in some war torn country or shitty favela after all these life realisations.

Between the heartwrenching montages and the absolutely breathtaking music, the two films would make a perfect double feature.

Great NYC tributes, outstanding animation, and such lovable characters. As someone who gave up on my big dream a while ago and had to slowly learn to be content with the life stuff, this movie just hits me in the feels. What I love too is when Joe had his epiphany, he was ready to die, because he realized he HAD lived. At least that's my takeaway. The second chance was just gravy, which is they didn't need to show us what he did. It's incredibly profound and, after such a rough year, it made me so grateful to be alive.

Yeah it would've been great to see this in the theaters, but I'm glad they released this now. What a great holiday pick-me-up. Also, Jon Batiste deserves the world, truly.",kkbd5s

gh35g1f,"What a beautiful, beautiful film. I love that Trent Reznor did the score. It still stood out among the amazing John Batiste jazz and that’s no easy feat. He’s done so many amazing scores the past few years. He was so unhappy doing just NIN for so long. Looks like he’s found his spark.",kkbd5s
gh3rwgm,"This movie definitely needed to be seen in theaters...everyone looks for a ""spark"" and sometimes they spark can stop you from enjoying life.

Sometimes you simply have to *live*. In 2020 with so much craziness, I think the message would have resonated with so many people on different levels.

Life is so confusing and sometimes we try to rationalize it and understand it. At the end of the day, you just have to live.

I absolutely loved this movie. Oddly enough, it's the one movie from Pixar than didn't purposely get you to cry.",kkbd5s
gh3t8yi,"Just watched it, i think is a really good movie.. The whole message of living everyday day its fullest was good.
Probably the best are the visuals, the animation while is not risky and is just hyper realistic is so beatiful, the textures, the lights and colors damn *chef kiss* and like how the beyond world characters were created only using straight lines that was clever ...but while i think the movie was really good there is something that keeps it away from being great and i dont really know what that is..
I think while i did enjoy the whole other world concept visuals but i find myself that i didnt care to know much about it, like i was waiting for more exploration with it like they did with coco or inside out,i just wanted to watch joe life and his realization to really live and enjoy life..bjt everytime he was in his soul form it kind of takes away from that 
So yeah, is a really good movie with a good message and doesnt try to manipulate your feelings and is visually beatiful but i think it could have been  much much more y'know..",kkbd5s

gh5exs2,I couldn’t get through WW84 so I switched to this instead and **MAN** I wish I could have seen this movie in full IMAX the animation is absolutely STUNNING! Soul didn’t feel like a kids movie at all and I loved every second of it. 22 & Joe are kindred spirits trying to figure out what life means to them and I related to that so much. 10/10!!,kkbd5s
gh5l9jd,"As a teacher, this one had me crying real quick",kkbd5s
gh9btvo,"Such a great movie. The flashback scene playing the piano near the end of the movie is some of the best stuff Pixar has ever done. Right up there with the opening of Up, maybe even better. The shot of him at the beach with the water hitting his feet was just an animation flex, and I loved it.


I don't know how to feel about the ending though. At first I hated it, but after thinking a didn't mind it. Right now I don't think it's *bad* but I feel like it will be seen as controversial.",kkbd5s

gi12cp0,"This movie was beautiful & left me with a feeling of renewal. It certainly hit me in the feels & made me think about mindfulness in my own life.

It’s right up there with Ratatouille in terms of quality, in some ways even better. The soundtrack is gorgeous and it’s so cool seeing Trent Reznor behind it. Highly recommend to anyone and everyone!",kkbd5s
gh2xwrk,"I'll be honest, I was quite underwhelmed. Visually, it's beautiful but as a story, I wasn't particularly engaged. 

I feel that the 'exploring philosophy through a colourful landscape' side of things is becoming a bit of a comfort zone for Pixar which both Inside Out and Coco did in much better ways. Those films did pose questions like 'what makes us who we are', 'what is important in life', or 'what happens after death' but only as themes that went alongside a story that was more gripping and characters that were more instantly appealing. And the big emotional pay off at the end here was just 'dude decides to enjoy the little things'. 

I was impressed with it visually - the musical scenes, the city landscapes, the character designs, there's an enormous level of detail that's gone into it - but the story structure was weaker than similar things Pixar have done on related themes. I feel like there was a lot of explaining rules for the 'other' world which turned out to be pretty irrelevant for the rest of the film which was mostly back on earth. 

Anyone watched it with young kids? I don't know if it would appeal to children as much as other works where there is a clearer 'adventure' to follow and less navel-gazing.",kkbd5s
gh3knwf,"One thing I think should be mentioned more is how Jaime Foxx is probably the best actor to voice actor I've seen. Usually it's obvious who the celebrity is like Tina Fey in this movie or Pratt and Holland in Onward, or even inside out where the celebrities are embellishing things from their voices(it works there a lot though compared to something like Onward), while Foxx just didn't sound like himself he was just playing Joe. I really don't like that a lot of animated movies now have less unique voices because it's just Jason Batemon as a Fox or the Rock as a god I'm glad they found a celebrity who actually voice acted and didn't just do Jaime Foxx, I literally forgot it was him until the credits.",kkbd5s
gh447qo,"I thought this movie was just okay, which is a bummer because Pete Docter is my favorite Pixar director/writer.  To me, it felt like Inside Out but not nearly as good.  The characters weren't as funny or charming, with the exception of Terry who is underutilized.  There are some good heartfelt moments, but none of them feel as poignant or relatable as the ones in Docter's other work, like Up and Inside Out. 
 The setup is VERY similar to Inside Out, but not as fleshed out.  Instead of your personality being shaped by memories and personified emotions in your head, it's shaped by metaphysical Picasso drawings shepherding souls through buildings that stamp them with a personality trait.  They rightfully focused on the only part of that process with any nuance, the development of your ""spark,"" but then kind of muddy what your ""spark"" actually is.  The message of the movie seems to be that your spark isn't your reason for living, but all souls are required to have a spark before they can live.  And your spark can apparently be the act of living itself.  They also establish that souls can't smell, taste, or touch, but can apparently hear fine and be inspired by music.  What about the chefs whose spark is cooking?

I know it seems like I'm nitpicking and going out of my way to find plot holes, but I'm only pointing these things out because I'm comparing it to Inside Out, which did an amazing job of creating an internal logic that governed how all of these abstract concepts worked and played off one another.  Even though it was all fantastical and made up, it felt like everything made sense in the universe they'd invented.  Soul felt kind of slapped together by comparison.

That said, there are some genuinely awesome things about this movie.  Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross have cranked out yet another amazing score, cementing their place amongst the legendary film composers like Hans Zimmer and John Williams.  The art direction of the Great Before is fantastic (though the souls do look a bit too similar to the emotions in Inside Out).  In fact, all of the metaphysical stuff looks really cool, which makes it it all the more disappointing that most of the movie takes place in New York, which looks pretty plain by comparison.

Anyway, that's my review.  It's worth watching, but it definitely doesn't sit at the top of the Pixar pantheon with Inside Out, Up, Monsters Inc, Toy Story, or The Incredibles for me.",kkbd5s
gh4rvqz,"I feel like this is the movie Inside Out should have been. It might be that I relate to this movie more being Black myself. But I felt that Inside Out lacked an actual connection to the main human character because at no point does the characters we see the majority of the movie and Riley ever interact. This felt like Pixar realizing that they could push it further. 

I also really liked the portrayal of Black American culture in the film. A lot of it was NYC specific but it still resonated with me even though I'm from the south.",kkbd5s

All three have neurotic and hyper focused jazz protagonists but either learn to improvise life the same way you improvise in jazz (Soul), give up everything else in life to achieve greatness (Whiplash), or learn to love the dream (La La Land).

I find Soul to have the message that resonates the most about the spark being the thing that drives you to get up every day and live life.",kkbd5s

So he goes into the zone to save 22 and left her live and the jerries decide to give him a second chance. So if the Jerries hadn't done that and he had just went to the great beyond, he would have just died at his piano? Or was the entire movie just something that he made up in his head to justify his life choices?  Did 22 and the whole great before really exist? Did he actually die? So many loose ends that while I enjoyed the ride, it didn't blow me away as I expected.",kkbd5s

gh1j6lb,"This movie really exceeded my expectations! I was really worried that it was going to be ""Inside out but with souls instead of emotions"" but it actually found a really good balance between the soul world and the human world. I don't think I watched any trailers for this one except for the first one, so I didn't expect the body switch/cat twist halfway through. This one also had a good amount of mature themes in it and I think it's definitely one of those Pixar movies that adults can get something out of as well which I loved. 

Pete Docter is one of the best directors that Pixar has (I may be biased because Monsters Inc is my favorite Pixar movie) and he really knocked it out again with this one. I think I actually rank Soul higher than Inside Out because I think it handled the fiction world vs human world balance much better!",kkbd5s
gh35l4a,"Overall, the movie was pretty good. Great, but not top tier Pixar great.

The voice acting was amazing, like the CGI (I would like to see an animated movie aimed at adults with that kind of CGI quality) and I liked how they combined many different themes, like optimism/pessimism, physics, acceptance/rejection of death and what a good life consists of.

However, the best thing about the movie was the directing. It was amazing. They showed so many different things in an amazing way. Also, that montage on the end, damn, this movie deserves an oscar nomination for best directing.",kkbd5s

gh4r8jx,"I honestly think the original ending to this movie was Joe walking into the great beyond. Joe getting a second chance seemed so sudden followed by the movie ending which makes me think they changed the ending.

I know Pixar movies have mostly happy endings but given that Soul talks a lot about death, I figured having the main character accept his fate was the proper ending",kkbd5s
gh1lz9t,"This was a big meh for me. The story feels like two movies fighting, one movie about a struggling musician and the other movie about the concept of the human soul, with neither side getting the necessary attention. For a movie that is about a jazz musician, there is way too little jazz music. Even for a kids movie, its handling of life, death, and the soul itself was toothless and lacking. The humor is hit or miss (with more misses than hits). And the story feels underdeveloped and hollow. I especially didn't need the entire body switch section, which just makes it feel more like a typical subpar kids movie than a Pixar movie. This movie was a disappointment and a huge waste of potential. However it's not completely terrible, the animation is breathtaking and when there is jazz music, it's great. But the animation and music can't save an overall disappointment of a film.

2.5/5.0",kkbd5s
gh1jxem,"Overall it was one of the best movies I’ve seen this year. As usual from Pixar it has unbelievably good animation and score. My biggest complaint with it is the very last minute or so of the movie, it felt like it should have ended as Joe was accepting death and going into the great beyond, but instead they just last minute revived him (albeit with a good message). I’d say it’s a 9/10 overall, I’d definitely recommend watching it, especially if you love jazz, it has an incredible score. One of the best Pixar movies in a long time.",kkbd5s
gh1kvzr,"Thought the movie was very good but was dissapointed by Pixar standards. Pacing seemed off and expected more jazz. The New York scenes were so gorgeous that I was dissapointed whenever the film was in the afterlife. 

Barber shop and the Knicks jokes were the best part",kkbd5s
gh1l1fl,"Wow, that was great. I can't help but think this was a risk for Pixar, as it seems oddly un-marketable as a Disney kids' movie. Aside from the marshmallow souls who are mostly the same, there's no goofy characters or critters to turn into toys or plushes. There's no singalong songs to get stuck in kids' heads. And the themes, though some are even explicitly said aloud, seem like they'd go over kids' heads- whereas with Inside Out kids could still grasp emotions, the crushing weight of living, mental burnout, depression, and mortality probably doesn't quite register with them yet. Heck, there was even only like 2 butt jokes, and they were funny.

All that said, I'm glad they made the movie they did. It's visually fantastic, incredibly creative, and a wonderful representation of some heavy topics in fun animation.

Nothing the souls do seems to phase them or create an emotional response till the very end. Humanity is a giant experiment with no purpose or end game.

gh3aypy,"I thought the film had some great parts, specifically the visuals and some of the philosophical discussion pieces, but by the end I felt whatever message or meaning I was supposed to take from it was a little nebulous. It never quite sticks the landing. The characters never seem to fully feel comfortable in their story either. The movie felt more cerebral than I care for in my Pixar films, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing if the film brings itself full circle. Soul felt like an incomplete circle for me.

gh4s6gk,"My review:

I just watched Soul with my parents and sister. We were all blown away with how good this movie was. I expected it to be a deep movie, but it was much deeper. I don’t think I’ve seen such a life-affirming movie since 127 Hours, where it reminds you to not take your life for granted. And to really hold on to it, and cherish the memories you make with the people you love. When the credits were playing, I was breaking down and telling everyone in the room that I really love everybody that’s in my life. I try to remind those messages to myself when I can.
The animation was one of the best I’ve seen in a Pixar movie, the music was great, and Jamie Fox and Tina Fey give excellent performances. If there’s a perfect movie we need in 2020, Soul is it.",kkbd5s
ghv2sfc,"I think the concept they were going for could have been more impactful if I liked the character 22. I loved the art style of the Jerry’s and the animation of Terry when he was sliding around on the walls. The Jazz music was beautiful. I really wanted to be moved by this movie but for me it just felt like it was lacking something. Still, I love Pixar for always coming up with unique ideas and for trying to portray deeper meanings in what are considered ‘kids’ movies.",kkbd5s
gh3uxcf,"It was good, not great imo. Ending was very abrupt. Would've liked to see where 22 ended up, unless I missed it",kkbd5s
gh4f05e,"I watched this on a whim hoping it would alleviate the awful aftertaste WW84 left in my mouth. 

Man, I was not expecting this to be such a refreshing mint. 

Before I even mention the story and writing here, this film is visually GORGEOUS. I mean I know, it's Pixar, and they simply don't miss with their animation stylings. But still, I was just constantly floored with some of the shots here, you can tell how much love and care when into the making of this. It perfectly rides that line of balancing realistic and cartoonish styles, which also serves to complement it's mature existential themes explored here. And then the ""soul world"" is this wonderfully imaginative blend of spiritual and tech aesthetics, enough to keep all ages engaged. I could keep gushing forever about the visuals but man, they absolutely nailed it here. 

The film tells two stories, one of a lost soul searching for their ""purpose"" or ""meaning"" in life, and another experiencing a mid-life crisis who thought they already had their ""purpose"" only to learn that it wasn't all they thought it would be. And it executes these two narratives with such grace and thoughtfulness that it's hard not to feel the tears swelling up at certain scenes. It attacks questions we've all encountered by the time we've reached adulthood, and I love that it doesn't try to beat you over the head with some cliche message, but instead (somewhat) leaves it up to you to decide what you want to take away from it. 

Very few ""children"" films have this tight of a script and explore this many dark adult themes. Toy Story comes to mind. But this was better than any Toy Story movie imo. The film is just straight up inspiring. It's about chasing your dreams but also not chasing them. The whole ""just appreciate life"" subject matter is typically so heavy-handed that it just feels condescending for a movie to spoon-feed it to you, especially when it comes in the form of a children's film, but this does it right. This is really something special. 

Lastly, I *LOVE* the way they handled representation in this movie. Joe being black was not a focal point of the story whatsoever. It was a piece of who he was, but it didn't define him. His story could've been told through a white, asian, hispanic, middle eastern, whatever protagonist and it still would've worked. That's the beauty of this. Like yes Joe is black, and here is the parts of his life influenced by black culture. But Joe isn't who he is *because* he's black. God it's refreshing to see minorities represented in this way in a big movie. It wasn't about Joe's struggle versus society. It was about Joe's struggle versus himself. Not that the society movies aren't important, but the market has been so saturated with them lately that it feels like pandering. This was simply a story where the character happens to be a minority, and that's it. And I absolutely adore the movie for that. When Joe talks about needing to get ""lined up,"" it doesn't feel like they're forcing it. He's just talking about how he needs a haircut. Man, I really wish films follow suit with this. I'm not black but it was nice to see a minority lead just tell a human story, and not a story about them being a minority. 

This film is almost a 10/10 for me. It still has it's flaws, like the characters of Terry and the hippie guy. Although I understand they're there for the children. And sure there are some loopholes here or there, but at the end of the day it tells a powerful spiritual journey that also doesn't come off as religious whatsoever, which is just another tremendous feat. 

And I haven't even mentioned how good the music is in this either. Man it's just a beautiful movie. A very touching way to end 2020.",kkbd5s
gh1iy4h,"The ending was so underwhelming to me.

1. The lost soul version of 22 was way out of left field. The climax feels so similar to Ralph Breaks the internet, whose 3rd act was also just a weird tone shift.
2. There seems to be a motif of teaching throughout the movie, seeing as Joe is a teacher for band but he also mentors 22 through the Great Beyond and through life. However, nothing about this is raised in the ending. Connie is no longer in the picture. Maybe this is nit picky, but I wish there was some payoff in some way through teaching.
3. While 22’s ending is ambiguous, which is fine as the viewer can guess what happens next, Joe’s ending is so abrupt. Not only does he get a cop out ending of “You can go back because you did good lmao” make his choice to give the badge to 22 meaningless, but it also makes it frustrating that the film just ends 5 seconds after that. This may be wanting too much, but we never see Joe apply the lessons he learned in his life. He just goes back and credits roll immediately. Something just felt off.

However, the rest of the film is quite good. Very engaging and interesting characters. The movie is very unique visually and music-wise. However, for a sort of spiritual successor to Inside Out, that films ending is far superior to that of this movie.",kkbd5s
icdnn2h,"This movie is great! The message really resonated with me because I was once a person who lived from moment to moment, appreciating what I have. It reminded me of what I was before. 

This might be nitpicking but I was confused how Joe Gardner couldn't hold a regular job and do gigs. Did I miss something? Did they explain this in the movie? A lot of music teachers do gigs as well, so why couldn't he?",kkbd5s

Then he sets on the path to finding her spark musically all over.!< Seemed a real missed opportunity, and honestly would have been the emotional payoff that I felt the movie lacked overall.

Also the Great Beyond & Before aspect seems really disconnected with what other movies seem to do with the cultures they are representing. Coco, Moana, Brave, etc. they all have some aspect of relation to mythos of the culture the characters belong to, but Soul was just like ... ""Black Americans believe in Heaven but we can't do that, so ... let's do this thing instead.""

Terry raises the rogue soul issue and rather than owning it,  the Jerrys 'champion' Terry with solving it in a classic 'not my job' move.  Terry then runs with the investigation with zero assistance and is resented for demanding recognition when efforts yield success - only to have the token reward yanked away when first opportunity when Jerrys, not Terry,  drop the ball again.

Then the final adjustment to the count completely undermines Terrys dedication to accuracy and his role just to suit their agenda despite protocol/policy.

I've been reading and listening about how we all think happiness is right around the corner, when we get that promotion, finish college or for Joe: get the gig that's going to change our lives. But there's always so much emphasis on that one moment that we often miss out the present and the now, and the happiness we already have (which amused and amazed soul 22 so much in the movie). 
This movie maybe isn't really for kids because at some points in life, we perhaps need the focus of having a target, a moment to be achieved. But as a lost 20 something (not 22 though, lol), this warmed my heart. ❤️",kkbd5s

The message is one that I assume many of us, including me, fail to realize in real life until a form of art like this comes along and shows us.

The sound is the standout of this film, mainly because I’ve never heard a Pixar film sound like this. I was expecting the jazz (which is great, thanks to Jon Batiste), but I wasn’t expecting the amazing electronic elements found within Reznor and Ross’s score. It’s an odd combination on paper, but it works really well.",kkbd5s

Essentially my whole life is up in the air and I have been spending these past 5 months finding myself. I have done a good job thus far but what has really been bothering me especially the past 2 months is the “what is my purpose” question. Like ..okay all this happened but what for? What am I supposed to do? Seeing 22 become obsessed with that. Seeing her spiral. Those voices telling her she wasn’t good enough. If that wasn’t exactly where I was at yesterday I would be lying. Straight lying. I am so grateful for this movie for if anything reminding me to just LIVE. Live and enjoy every moment not consumed with reason or purpose or needing to make it count or any of that. Just live and enjoy it. Be present. Anyhow- that’s what it spoke to me.",kkbd5s
gh1v0d6,"The metaphysics world did not work for me at all in this movie.  The rules are very loosey goosey compared to, say Inside Out, and really can't stand any scrutiny.

* How is Joe the only one with unfinished business in hundreds of years?  The movie didn't establish him as special in this way.
* Why is the Zone-state part of the Great Before?
* Why is a only a completed Earth pass transferable?
* Why would giving it up kill Zone-state Joe? He can just go back through the box and oven and have Moonwind throw something at him.
* Why is Terry so obsessed with Joe's tally, but then blasé about the further mistakes when Joe replaces the cat,  and the cat dies?
* Why is the cat still alive when we saw its soul go up the treadmill?

I would have preferred the removal of all of the Jerry and Terry stuff, and had 22 do a very short ""Here's how this Great Before seems to work, we don't know why.""  Then spend way more time on Earth developing  Joe's early obsession with and later dissatisfaction with Jazz as a purpose in life.

Some of my favorite things were the world building too from the before life stuff. The hippies being the ones that could transverse between worlds was so genius!

The initial subject is pretty heavy to begin with and I think Pixar crew have done their best to break it down for general public to understand, but it's really one of those movie where the best description we could give to a curious kid is, ""You will understand the movie better when you're old enough."".

Idk man, this is probably my trance-brain talking, I'm still rearranging my thoughts after finishing this movie.",kkbd5s
gh1z3o4,"This is certainly Pixars most ""adult"" movie. I would say it even surpasses Ratatouille in this regard. So much is lent to simple dialogue about life and it tackles things in a very subtle and mature way. I never understood why people complained about the trailers depicting the ""other world"" as the main focus of the movie (I personally don't see why anyone wanted a Pixar movie about regular human events occurring--why even have it be animated at that point?) but incredibly I came out of this movie with that world being the last thing on my mind. The jokes are there but it's so sparse that I even found my 3 year old nephew bouncing up and down out of boredom while I was entranced with everything. The visuals are there and a lot of it is cute but there almost doesn't seem to be anything remarkably marketable about this movie either. I don't see kids buying plushies or merch flying off the shelves of these characters especially because they don't necessarily have qualities that could appeal to a young kid. This movie just oozed passion for the sake of it. It is a testament to the beauty of life and in that regard I think adults could especially appreciate what the movie is trying to say.

I haven’t see it in anyone’s comment but I want to highlight that Pixar has been making animated movies since ‘95. That’s right, 25 years. So for many people who look like me, who have enjoyed Pixar for years, it means so much to see people like us just existing. The truth is, American cinema (animation too) has not been diverse and the default has been normalize for far too long. 

The small details of Joe having clippers to edge up his hairline or having to go to the barbershop. This movie being consumed by everyone (because D+ has a huge market/audience) makes critics seem less important because I know this movie will make so many young kids life easier. I think people need to be seen, especially as humans because we are... we just have unique backgrounds.",kkbd5s
gh27fpe,"Well, I ugly cried towards the end of the movie. When Joe was at the piano looking at all of 22s memories during her time alive, just an all time greatest Pixar moment. What a beautiful and poignant message about how it’s okay to just be. 

Also, that soundtrack was incredible. I never thought that I’d see Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross on a Pixar movie but it was an amazing match, the music even out of context of the movie is emotional. The song by Jon Baptiste that played during the credits was beautiful too.

Coco and Moana are examples of movies that have magical settings that are culturally consistent with the movies' real world settings.

ghi7f37,"I think this might just be my favorite Pixar movie of all time. It was so beautifully designed, written and executed. Joe's arch is phenomenal. It starts off showing this guy who is so driven by his own dream, but hints at his current life (as a band teacher, when Carly starts going off on her tangent. It shows her spark and Joe feeling elated). It hints at there being more than just one spark. 
I bet howt would have been one of the lost souls had he not died. Him growing and realizing that his passion for music could be used in other ways (like when he's chilling in Jays chair and Jay says he's just doing this to help h his family, and he enjoys making people's days much more). It all hints back to Joe's full time offer. Taking 22 under his wing, showing her (and the audience) that all the theoretical knowledge in the world might be well and great, but unless you can learn to live in the moment with a childlike curiosity, there is little to gain for your soul. 
It seemed that the jerries were indicative of some educators, well intentioned but misguided. It showed how all the mentors were super passionate about their thing, like Joe was about Jazz, and how that could be used for good (moulding future souls or people). 

I loved the message that it wasn't too late for Joe to essentially view his own life in a different lens, have genuine conversations with the people around him, and rediscover a new passion for life.",kkbd5s
ghsepn7,"I liked the movie, it's cute, but it's probably my least favorite Pixar movie (at least of those that I've seen). I just felt that it was too preachy for my taste. Most Pixar movies have some kind of message behind them, but it's usually pretty subtle and takes a back seat to the story. This movie on the other hand felt like it was 90% message and 10% story. It's like they were constantly beating me over the head with this existential pondering of purpose and that kind of sucked the enjoyment out of it for me.

gh3rm6k,"It's crazy how bad the initial trailer for this movie was, and how brutally people responded to it. I forgot the cowboy dance thing completely until I revisited it. I didn't really have any expectations for this film other than that it might be similar to Inside Out, but let's just say it blew those expectations out of the water. The artistic style of this movie is absolutely incredible, particularly the real world. I am genuinely gagged over the character designs of this film. This film takes the boring Frozen-eque same face syndrome their previous films have suffered from and pisses all over it with hundreds of unique and distinct faces and bodies. I sincerely hope Pixar continues in this direction of character design. The dialogue is also brilliant and obviously customised to an authentic experience, nothing in the film really feels like a standard kiddy film trope. It hardly feels like a kids film at all, nor an adults film, it tackles themes of existentialism in such a tactful yet gentle manner that it allows its message to transcend the designations of demographics. I watched this with my family and it seems the more mature audiences will be hit much harder by this film, which I think is a fantastic quality for the kids watching this now who get to revisit this film as adults with the additional nostalgia. If there's one thing I can say about this, it's incredibly unique and unlike anything Pixar has released recently, even Inside Out or Coco. The plot is so tranquil, with gorgeous art and the jazzy soundtrack too, I just wanna watch this again and again. I haven't really digested the film fully yet, but this might be the greatest thing Pixar has done in a long time.",kkbd5s
gh4zwyc,"I like that the theme of the movie is that life is not about obsessively pursuing a purpose; that it's more important to enjoy the little things in the moment that spark joy. It's a great message, although not really practical in terms of real-world application in a society where we're constantly judged by every single thing we do (or don't do). I think about that scene where the lost soul is riddled with anxiety and then he finally ""wakes up"" and quits his job as a hedge fund manager. Coming from a mega-conglomerate like Disney, it's a message that feels kind of hypocritical. I still enjoyed the movie though, and shed a tear at the end. It's a very nice sentiment, even though I think we've seen it done better before.

Also, I find it kind of amusing going through the comments and seeing how some kids love it and find it inspiring while other kids hate it and find it boring. It kind of shows you what type of adults they're going to become. This is a very deep, spiritual, heady film, so if your kid ""gets"" it, they're probably an old soul themselves.",kkbd5s

So, how come Terry is only looking for Joe and not the Professor or the cat's soul? I can excuse the cat if you say he's only accounting for human souls, but still... If the Professor went to the afterlife and Joe didn't, the total number should stay the same and he would not have caught it.

gh1j0og,"This one *really* fell flat for me, especially as Pixar goes.

I feel like the movie absolutely refused to commit to its premise, which led to some serious pacing issues, as well as what I’d call an identity crisis halfway through.

We got, what, maybe three minutes of Joe’s life before he falls through the manhole? It felt like we were thrust into the Great Before almost immediately. I hardly knew Joe, hardly knew his life. Just the very bare bones. We know Pixar can do a lot with a little, but I don’t think the very beginning minutes of this movie is a good example of that.

So Joe’s dead, but why do I care? I barely know him from when he was alive. Plus, *nobody else* on the treadmill to the Great Beyond seems to really care? Surely Joe isn’t the only one with unfinished business. It all came together to really not give me a sense of urgency or stakes about Joe’s situation at all, save for Joe screaming “but my gig!” at me over and over again.

Then, they hardly spend any time really exploring the ins and outs of the Soul World, especially compared to, well, the obvious comparison - *Inside Out.* Inside Out really took the time to explore the world within Riley’s brain, and get creative with it. I feel like *Soul,* on the other hand, just again gave us a bare bones “this is where the personalities happen, this is where they go to earth, this is the treadmill to the Great Beyond,” and so on, without taking a lot of time to really explore the world. It felt so rushed to me, in fact, that before I knew it, I was suddenly watching a body swapping movie about a man and a cat. That was a *strange* leap, to me. The thread of 22 helped tie one premise to the other, but not particularly *strongly* in my opinion.

Then, the ending. Is it just me, or is it *incredibly* obvious that they were driving toward one particular ending for Joe, and then just completely abandoned it at the last second with the “one more chance” thing. It seems to me that the original script had Joe discovering that his real spark was *teaching,* and ultimately staying “dead” to remain a mentor for more new souls. Everything, and I mean *everything,* pointed at this being the natural conclusion to Joe’s story here. He starts off as a teacher, is immediately encouraging toward one of his students, had an enormous impact on an old student’s life to the point where that student, as an adult, is reaching out to let him know about that impact on multiple occasions, the scene with the trumpet girl where he immediately understands her strengths and weaknesses, the fact that he’s mentoring 22 the entire movie, the thing with the barber not becoming a veterinarian but still feeling fulfilled and like he’s saving lives with what he does, the fact that being a mentor is even a plot point to begin with, the fact that 22’s climactic scene is all about her relationships with past mentors, as well as her relationship with Joe, Joe seeing 22 off as she finally enters the world. It was all leading up to Joe staying dead so he can continue to impact people the best way he knows how - teaching and mentoring, despite music being another obvious passion. But then, out of nowhere, sparks don’t actually mean anything concrete, it’s just a nebulous “when you’re ready to live” type thing, he’s suddenly granted another chance at life, and it ends with him saying the most cliche “I dunno what I’m gonna do in life but I’m gonna live every second of it” line, and the credits roll? Honestly, what a letdown.

All that said, there was plenty I liked about it - the visuals were astounding, NYC in Pixar’s style was great. The music was great. The sequences of Joe losing himself in his music were great. The message was good, if a bit vague and muddled. 22’s insecurities hit pretty close to home and resonated well. Really liked the fast paced, Pixar style humor woven throughout the film. Jaime Foxx and Tina Fey gave excellent performances as leads, as did the rest of the supporting cast.

Overall, I enjoyed it enough, but frankly once the credits rolled I found myself thinking a lot more about the bad than the good, which is *not* the case with my favorite Pixar movies. I’d be surprised if I ever watched it again.",kkbd5s
gh2c2q1,"I don’t know, to me, the overarching message seemed pretty shallow considering this movie was dealing with themes of existence, purpose, death. ""You can find meaning and happiness in the little things in life"" isn’t actually a very original message, and in today’s era it almost feels condescending, but maybe people will appreciate the reminder. Also did anyone else feel like the storyline with 22 was just really artificial? The foundation for it was extremely cliché and I just never cared about it. And the end just retcons the whole reason for why little things are important and valuable in life… because they come to an end one day and part of living is accepting that. I know it’s a kid’s movie so I understand, but if I’m judging it as a movie without the “Kids” caveat, it makes its own message a little bit weaker. To me the movie tried to make something out of deep themes and falls short. 3/10.",kkbd5s

ghka6ca,"Overall I definitely enjoyed the movie. It didn't make me cry like other pixar films did including Onward or Up, but the message was simple and resonated with me. 

The design of the souls was very generic and basic but I'm fairly sure that's intentional to make the real world more visually appealing which you could guess from the first trailer.

I do agree that the ending was a bit forced with Joe being given a second chance, if it ended with Joe's death it would have probably made a better ending but it felt like Disney changed the script last second.",kkbd5s

But Soul... oh God, Soul. It's like I found a new meaning to what a DP film should aspire to be: deep but accessible, mature but friendly, and overall important. If I had to gush about the many different things I loved in Soul, it might take a wall of text to fully articulate how much it spoke to me on such a personal level.",kkbd5s

Eh what do I know though. They know their target audience well",kkbd5s
gh1jlrw,"I really liked how the ending left a lot of the potential threads unresolved. 

Does he actually become part of quartet or does he realize that teaching music is meaningful? They kept referencing some potential love interest, Lucy, and she was only on screen for like 20 seconds in the whole movie (at least I think that was her in the tailor shop in the beginning) and we never know if they end up together. They also never tell your where 22 ended up once she became a human (I thought she would end up coming into his classroom years later or maybe even pulling some timey-whimey crap and making her is future daughter). 

All of those things would have been nice to know, and I think other children’s movies would have gone that route where he chooses to live the simple life and be more than just a jazz musician but that would have missed the more important message: The point of life is not to settle for simple dreams but rather to breath in every moment of it into your very soul.",kkbd5s
gh44kff,"I felt as though the message of the film got convoluted towards the end. I posted this elsewhere but feel like I would like the movie if the main character got some perspective on his life and saw how he inspired people like Curly and trombone girl and decided he lived a good life even if it didn't work like he wanted. He could let Tina Fey ghost live out his life or he could just accept death but that's just what I expected the movie to go. Where we ended up was decent, but he basically gets a second chance that no other corporal being has ever had before. It felt like a copout because in the end he didn't really make any sacrifices and got bailed out. Compare this with like Monsters University where Mike is told that he isn't scary and that fact remains true to the end. 


I also felt as though the movie was jumping from plot point to plot point instead of being a collection of scenes. Compare this to some of their other movies and it's a little too frantic in getting places instead of emotional moments. I don't remember a lot and believe it's going to be next to Brave on the Pixar tier list.",kkbd5s
gi5hhsg,"Joe should have died in the end, it would have been a much better movie and a lesson about life.",kkbd5s
ghjan4w,"As someone who is dealing with existential dread and thinking that achieving success makes me less sad when I actually die, this movie made me cry like 3 times. Obviously the carpe diem message has been done many many times but this movie still managed to get to me. Honestly, when Joe felt empty after getting his dream job and when he said ""those aren't goals, that's just normal life""(or smt like that), it really resonated with me because those are literally things I have felt multiple times. The best scene in the movie is Joe's realisation scene, which really made me cry. The movie depicts Joe's life at the beginning of the movie as empty, where he does not achieve big goals like the doctor guy he was impersonating. He is the conductor in a school band, he sits around in cafes, etc. But this is turned around in his realisation scene where him eating the cake in the cafe is depicted as being an enjoyable moment in life, and Idk why but I just started bawling after that. Obviously this movie doesn't explore deeper meanings but like come on, Zootopia gave a really shallow message on racism and everyone still loved it. And ofc I was left thinking about what happened to that guy in the movie who said the cliched ""What am I doing with my life"" line. I mean like, you do know you still need money to literally survive right? Still a 10/10 tho",kkbd5s

gljvqcv,"Soul was funny at times and had good music but was anyone else completely unsurprised with the ""you have to enjoy the little things in life message""? Isn't that kinda obvious?! The movie was so hyped that I honestly thought I would get a good philosophical message so this was disappointing. So if you already enjoy the little things, what value does Soul even bring?",kkbd5s
gh1l113,"Hated it. Breakneck pace with no idea of what it wanted to be. A million ideas with not even a second to explore one. Was hoping for a ratatouille, felt like i got something trying to be it without an idea of what made Ratatouille great. There are amazing moments in here, watered down by terrible pacing. A waste of potential",kkbd5s
gh4kkbf,"An admirable misfire. I appreciate what Soul was trying to say - life is worth living even if your dream doesn't come true - but they fumbled the execution by trying to have it both ways. Joe gets back to his body and achieves his dream… only to find it hollow after ONE NIGHT. Come on, that’s just silly. It’s also disingenuous coming from Pixar artists who do what they love for a living. 

You can show the beauty of ordinary life without downplaying the joy of chasing (and achieving) your dreams. Not to mention you can chase dreams AND enjoy the little things in life. It's not either/or. I also thought Soul got lost in its own world-building. I don’t mind a few logic leaps here and there, but this time, there were so many head-scratching moments that it took me out of the story. For example...

- If Joe's fall was so severe that he was dying in a hospital, then why was he perfectly fine to walk around town when his body regained consciousness? 

- How did Terry “lose count” of Joe? He can see everything from his two-way mirror platform and Joe was frantically running the wrong way through a crowd.

- Why would the Jerrys mistake Joe for Dr. Borgensen? They clearly know who he is - they even have footage of him. And where is Borgensen anyway? Why isn’t he there to point out the imposter?

- If “22 Joe” has all of his knowledge and memories, then why does she not know what pizza/hunger is? Also, when speaking to Joe’s mom, why does 22 need Cat Joe feeding her lines if she has access to his brain?

- Speaking of which, the film makes it clear that when Cat Joe speaks, the cat meows. But when he’s telling 22 what to say to his mom, the cat is suddenly silent. They just established that rule 10 minutes ago and now they broke it.",kkbd5s
gh36hao,"Didn't like it at all. It just felt.....without any solid idea what it wants to be about? Like, as if someone at Pixar had a vague idea of what they wanted out of it, and then no one really followed through - the moments which I think were supposed to be somber and poignant fell...flat? The ""funny"" moments we've seen done a thousand times..... The only really good scene was the one in the barber shop, that actually had some soul(ha!) in it. Me and my wife watched it today and it was just boring as hell. Save yourself the 2 hours and watch something else.

Edit: I love that since it seems to be a generally liked movie if you voice any opinion disagreeing, it immediately goes into negative points. Great discussion guys, someone dislikes something that you do? Downvote. Galaxy brain stuff.",kkbd5s
ghg5t9y,"The film to me was wasted potential. Amazing concept, but needed a few more years in re-write to land the execution. 

The biggest miss is obviously the message, very generic ‘carpe diem’ that’s been done a thousand times but even less ambitious and less impactful than Dead Poet’s Society. The message was ‘enjoy the little moments’ but the movie was clearly rushing plot point to plot point, only exploring the message when it needed to during 22’s body swap and the flashback. To really develop that message, the movie itself needed to slowdown and show how to ‘enjoy the little moments’ and the beauty in everyday life. 

I think what happened here was the payoff from the body swap was extremely lackluster for the time invested. Sure, Joe learns that he didn’t handle his relationships well. But he doesn’t learn much from that, and it doesn’t necessarily relate to ‘enjoy every second of living’, disconnecting a large portion of the movie to the main message. 

As others mentioned, I think they really dropped the ball by not exploring mentoring as the primary message. Mentoring would have tied in much better to the relationships theme, and gave Pixar a path to explore what it means to live through relationships, to provide for the next generation and the cycle of life and death. It’s a much more difficult story to tell, but I think with the pieces they had it’s where they should have went with this story overall instead of shoe-horning their intended message.",kkbd5s
gh5vudm,I dont really know how I feel about this one tbh. I never really got into it and then it just ended abruptly.,kkbd5s
ghcdgx0,This is an S tier Pixar movie. I’m seeing way too many people shitting on it in here.,kkbd5s
ghhdxk6,"I enjoyed the movie but man, I felt like it was REALLY depressing. The ending was just hurtful. It felt like they tacked on the 2nd chance at the end because they figured it was too much. He accepts death after having what should be the night of his life and still feeling unfulfilled. Maybe it just hits too close to home. This was not an enjoyable or beautiful kind of sad.

gh4lb7j,"Just finished watching Soul and absolutely loved it! wondering if anyone else thinks there is significance behind the number ""22"" being chosen for the character 22. Do you think it is referencing a ""catch 22""? As in your spark cannot become your purpose nor can your purpose become your spark. 

Joe's purpose on earth is to be a teacher as he teaches 22 how to live and attain her spark. however Joe's spark is jazz but his spark is unable to be his purpose. similarly his purpose of teaching can not be his spark.",kkbd5s

gihql33,"I am a music teacher and I didn't like Soul. I am trying to understand why. I think it's the part of the film that backhanded his experience in being a teacher.

ghl1mhu,"Within 25 minutes into the movie, and I already loved it. It was different for Disney to talk about topics normally avoided with younger audiences. In this case, death, finding your purpose in life, and how to live your life. In fact, for anyone lost in this world, I'm certain this would resonate with them. In particular with 22's spark, it was more hard hitting. Your spark in life can come from little things and at an abrupt time regardless of age. The graphics were amazing.

I did have issues with the ending. I think it would have been more emotional had they let Joe die. Also, I did have a particular problem with Terry. Although, my question is this: if what Joe did is considered cheating, would a patient being resuscitated back to life be considered cheating?",kkbd5s
ghl59ug,"This movie was incredible. There are a few things that really stuck out to me and they were:

So many movies have the goal to be something like a successful artist or something, but living is so much more than your end goal. Even if you reach your goal, you need to keep living.

Also, when he was having the heart to heart with his mom, 22 in his body had him doing the motions like he was talking,  he was staring as the cat, focusing on what to say.",kkbd5s

ghy46p3,"So, the plot of this movie in a literal sense: 

Joe gets the gig of a lifetime, has a major accident and ends up in a hospital (presumably with some degree of traumatic brain injury with being unconscious), elopes from the hospital and wanders around NYC acting strange and manic, collapses on a subway platform, plays the gig but feels unfulfilled after, goes home to play piano and consider not going on with life anymore.  

Joe needs some help.  He may have a slowly spreading brain bleed, be in a post-concussive state, or just straight bipolar.",kkbd5s
gh772wn,"It's hard not to rate this as a ""good"" movie on a binary good/bad scale. While I loved the animation and a handful of scenes, this movie just didn't do it for me. My thoughts:


- Everything having to do with ""the before"" or ""the after"" was substantially less interesting than anything in New York. That world was visually boring, and it's rules and purpose were really convoluted. We didn't see anything that wasn't done better in Inside Out. These parts really hurt the movie for me, and I think it'd be a better film set entirely in NYC or at least less in the before/afterlife... or if they did better with that world. I did like the line drawing Terry and Jerrys.




-At best the messages were mixed and trite and at worst they were contradictory and just plain bad. The main takeaway of ""enjoy every moment"" ""find joy in the mundane"" has been done to death, and is hardly something that will resonate with kids. The messaging on pursuing your dreams was mixed, and I actually felt like the movie undersold the importance of and satisfaction that comes with working hard to achieve a goal. There were some other passing lessons about personal relationships that felt half baked. Overall, you could make a convincing argument for the message to be ""pursuing your dreams ans working hard doesn't pay off, just be a bum and be happy with that."" That might be an effective message for depressed adults, but I don't think it's valuable for most people, especially kids.




- There just wasn't enough of the good parts. I loved the scenes where Joe was interacting with other living people - the barber shop scene, the scene with his mom, the scene with the trombone girl... those were by far the best part of the movie. A more character and relationship driven movie in the same world would have been soooooo much better. 


I guess a TL/DR of my points would be the movie would have been way better without 22 and the before/after world, and with a better core message. There is a much better movie hidden somewhere in Soul.",kkbd5s
ghhye88,"Even now Pixar  and its storytelling formula of two kind of selfish people learning to be better people together and forming a friendship still can make me tear up.

It captured everything about my culture so well. The barbershop conversations, Joe's mother reminded me so much of one of my grandmother's too. ""We gotta get to bed,we old!"" is such an older black person thing to say. 

The animation was fantastic and Joe's character journey as well as 22's were very well told and emotionally pulled at me, even if like I said before they've done this same ""opposites who are what the other needed"" thing before.  

Animation was on point, music was on point, setting was accurate and perfect. I loved every minute of it and my only regret is that Disney didn't do any theatrical release here even as a limited thing.

Not even fully pandemic’s fault, but general career building and imposter syndrome phase of life. Been thinking about life and death way too much and having this movie visualising my thoughts was something I really needed. I was really emotionally exhausted after watching it but it was super satisfying and now feeling more optimistic about my perspective on life. It’s one of those movies where I want to become a better person after watching it. Comic relief worked super well on me so kept switching from laughing and crying. 

Compared to other Pixar movies, this ending was definitely short but I think that’s part of the message and I guess audiences or myself may not be used to open endings? I do prefer it over Onward’s structure, where I love the ending but don’t feel like rewatching because the build up isn’t interesting to me. I like the idea of ‘Inside Out is made for children, Soul is made for adults’. I did have a similar but lighter reaction to Inside Out, but over the years I kinda stopped caring for that movie (still like it). Soul currently shot up into my Top 3 and do hope it ages better than Inside Out did for me.

As someone who has tons of hobbies, I’m ready to call my future space ‘Hall of Everything’ lol. Other random thoughts include how 22 was most likely supposed to be some caveperson, that Mr. Mittens lost one of its 9 lives and if ‘annoying middle aged woman voice’ is a Karen joke. Last night I coincidentally got in a reddit rabbit hole after reading that TrueOffMyChest post about children with psychotic symptoms and kept thinking about that while 22 was introduced. Visual details were amazing, from the reflection of the sax to the bended shelves of Joe’s bookcase. I like sewing so Joe’s mom being a tailor was also really enjoyable to watch.

I think there’s so many movies that say “artists are better than everyone else, if you’re not an artist you don’t get it”, it was cool to see a movie that treated not being a creative as being equally valid.

I really think the movie was very smart, well-acted, and gorgeous, but since I get really affected by second-hand embarrassment, I wasn’t as able to enjoy the film as I would’ve liked

Edit: Another thing. I liked how abrupt the ending was. We don’t get to see if he chose being a gig musician or being a band teacher, because it doesn’t really matter. He has learned to take life as it is and to really enjoy his life even if he’s not having great success. We’re given multiple reasons for either choice, so either seems likely enough",kkbd5s

Here’s a better alternative ending IMO: Joe ascends towards the Great Beyond. He enters, we see his eyes light up in wonder and tranquility, then cut to black. It would have conveyed the message that death isn’t something terrible and sparked a debate about what Joe really saw.",kkbd5s

ghqz2le,"I was fortunate enough to watch this in the cinema and mannnnn the movie is gorgeous. As soon as it started I was just in awe with the details, the lighting, how photorealistic everything is. The animation and lighting are also incredible especially the musical instruments and peoples faces and how the light changes with movement. And as someone pointed out, the hand movements during piano and sax play is just so fascinating to watch! Amazing! 

22 is hilarious. I love the message in the movie. It just reminded me of Zombieland Rule 32: Enjoy the little things. There’s one thing tho, I’d like more closure?? Like did joe continue with the band or goes back to teaching? But it’s not a huge issue 
cause at that point I was already bawling.

gh1od27,"Its too bad that Disney basically chose money over writing. Even though the animation and art style were absolutely flawless, it felt like the writing just fell through. This movie feels like someone tried to create a serious animated movie about a man who realizes that his life’s goal wasnt everything he wanted, but still finds happiness, but then Disney was like “ if we do that we cant sell cute little toys and merchandise!” and then they tried to add elements to appeal to a younger demographic so they could milk it for all of the money that it is worth. Like why how is him turning into a cat affect the plot like at all. I feel like many of the scenes were unnecessary and I would have really liked it if they would have focused a little more on the internal struggle of the main character and less on this wacky new world that they wanted to introduce. I personally liked the main character and the most of the side characters, they all felt like people who could actually exist. Their problems were real, they showed that even though sometimes you arent able to follow your dreams, as said by the famous disney motto, doesn’t mean that you have to lead a sad life, that sometimes the things you want to do are not the ones that will necessarily make you happy. Over all decent film, but i cant help but be just a bit disappointed.",kkbd5s

I am a creative currently under parental pressure to choose a life of stable drudgery over my preferred creative outlet, living in relative poverty and instability, and debating my choice on an existential level. Never, *never* has a Pixar movie struck home like this one did. 

Have I been touched by Pixar movies in the past? Of course. *Finding Nemo* is a top tier narrative. *Toy Story* has been great, repeatedly. *Inside Out* hit emotional development in all of the right ways.

I couldn’t help but think about the striking resemblance towards the ideology most people think of when they have a shroom trip, the way 22 acted in Joe’s body and how they were just in awe of the beauty of just being in this world and looking around. Also, the realization that just simply *being* alive is amazing in and of itself, how amazing the world can be if we could stop for a moment and realize how lucky we are to have this opportunity, to live. 

They captured that so well in this movie, for anyone who hasn’t tried shrooms I’d genuinely say the message behind this movie is a close second to how you come out of a trip.",kkbd5s

gh4s89w,"This movie absolutely broke me and not in a good way. **I absolutely hated this movie.** 

I love almost every single movie Pixar has ever made (Cars 2 excluded), but - for me - this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  We have a main character who has been struggling to achieve a personal goal his entire life and the movie just completely shits on him like that's just the worst thing. I get that sometimes achieving a goal after fighting for so long can feel underwhelming and even deflating, leaving a sense of ""What's next?"", but the messaging here is all over the place. 

In one scene Joe defends his dreams to his mother and the movie implies that this is some sort of breakthrough - fighting the world to achieve a dream. She points out that chasing dreams doesn't necessarily create financial security or guarantee health, but he presses on. The message is that it's okay to hold on to your dreams. After Joe hits his goal he's left with emptiness - which happens. But then the movie decides that a person's ""spark"" isn't really anything that you work towards. He shouldn't have been working so hard towards his dreams because he was missing enjoying life! Are you kidding me?

Then we have the fact that apparently you can cheat death if you just really want it badly and walk the wrong way on an escalator. Good luck explaining that one to my kids. Oh, your loved ones wouldn't have died if they just **wanted to walk back badly enough.**

The rules of the world make no sense, as if the writers were inventing magic buttons to move the plot along. Oh, want to get back to the real world? Well we have people who meditate and can reach the soul plane. Or play the piano. Or play basketball. Not so hard to speak to the dead now, is it?

I work so hard for my family and I try to cherish life when I can. I am beat down every single day of work to try to make ends meet for my family and the message of this movie is ""Well, don't, just be happy, no need to chase those dreams."" After watching this movie my family told me ""see, you work way too hard, you need to stop and enjoy life!"" I work hard because I need to support them and I have professional goals I'm trying to achieve. This movie makes me want to not ever work towards any goals ever again. Why have goals if they are completely meaningless? My career, goals, and stability for my family are all on the same track and then this movie comes along to make me feel like garbage.

I am truly happy for everyone if this movie was life-affirming for them. For me, it made me feel awful for every working hard towards my personal goals.",kkbd5s

gh1o6r2,"Did anyone catch Joe’s hint to NYC racism? While 22 was in Joe’s body trying to hail a cab- Joe mentioned how now hailing a cab with 22’s uncoordinated movements was even harder than usual.

The “than usual” is a nod to cabbies looking over giving him a ride because of what he looks like. 
I really liked this comment because this movie was not about Joe being black by any means. Yet, since Joe IS black there was still a nod towards the everyday hoops he has to jump through just because he is black. I liked that small comment and it made me appreciate Pixar a bit more.",kkbd5s
gh1q6mw,"*Soul* felt to me like it was missing a piece.

We have these plot points:

* Joe doesn't feel fulfilled by teaching; he dreams of performing
* Then he sees the impact that a little encouragement can have on a student's morale
* And he achieves his dream of performing ... but he doesn't feel the joy he expected, and he seems a little dejected by the idea of doing this again night after night
* Meanwhile, he turns out to be a really good teacher
* And the Great Before appears to need good teachers

All of this seems to be leading up to something. The simple way out would be ""Joe realizes that a life of teaching is more fulfilling than a life of being a performer."" Other directions could be ""Joe realizes that the mundane things that fill up the rest of his life off stage are the truly important things"" (i.e. *Mr. Holland's Opus*), or even ""Joe comes to accept that the dull and mundane parts of life are important because they pay the bills so he can do the exciting parts"" (y'know, the tradeoff of being an adult).

But instead ... there's no resolution to Joe's plot arc. He's just sent back to Earth. What does he do now that he's landed the gig of his dreams? Notice that his teaching job is hardly mentioned at all after the first few minutes of the film.

Also - I would have liked a better explanation of why Joe loves Jazz. What about that music style speaks to him? They could have substituted classical music, and the plot wouldn't have skipped a beat.

Wish we would have gotten to see just a little bit of his ""new"" life, I had predicted that since his big shot didn't make him happy he would go back to teaching because he could inspire folks.

One criticism I read about that I hadn't even thought of was it being problematic that this Black character spends the majority of the movie being ""voiced"" by a white lady.

I could definitely see how it was problematic to some folks.

ghml8ru,"This was a weird one for me, finished the movie thinking it was one of my favorite Pixar films to waking up the next morning thinking it’s one of the worst just like Inside Out. I loved the animation and how NYC was portrayed (despite it being a weird mish mosh since they threw my neighborhood in Queens in the east village, but I digress), and I really liked the start of the film. I liked the portrayal of purgatory essentially and the whole moving on tunnel. Annnnd that’s about all I liked.

Having Joe finally attain his goals and for that to mean absolutely nothing is just such a shitty message the movie has. It’s basically trying to oppose appreciating the little things with having a goal and fuck that nonsense, you can do both simultaneously. The movie even shows Joe enjoying the little things to us but also shows that he has a goal he hasn’t attained yet essentially and he’s frustrated over that. Having goals doesn’t make you bad and having him instantly go to disappointment after he achieves his goal is insanely out of character. It’s also the opposite of the real world — many strive to achieve goals and get jobs they truly love and while they have to do it every day they still love it. That’s the real thing we should strive for in life, but instead the movie basically boils it down to, “goals bad, return to monkey.” The message gets so muddied because of poor execution.

Speaking of poor execution, I’m also really not a fan of the film setting up foreshadowing of Joe feeling fulfilled musically because he’s creating sparks in his students and continuing the spread of music appreciation. All of the story beats are there, it’s a perfect angle especially since the movie also wants that story beat of Joe being disappointed after his amazing performance, but it never comes. Joe *was* living his goal all the time and just didn’t know it, but the movie even fails to consider this as an option despite going out of its way to set it up as a possibility. It feels like remnants of an old script that were left as a result and makes the film come off as incredibly disjointed.

I also really hated the whole swapping bodies stuff. I wish Pixar could for once just make a straightforward movie. From the trailers for this it looked like that’s what we’d be getting for once and instead it was just standard Pixar one character helping out the other nonsense. It’s fine, but overdone, and, I know they do it so that the film appeals to children, but here it’s done at the expense of the movie as a whole, sadly. And while we’re on that point, 22 as a character just creates a LOT of off beats with the film. Yeah, 22 spent a lot of time with famous people, but what about souls that don’t? The messages of the film don’t apply universally and it’s trying to speak on something universal: souls. 22 was also just kind of a grating asshole in ways too and, I dunno, just more that really needed to be re-written and fleshed out better.

I dunno, there’s a fantastic film buried in here that got lost and muddied along the way due to trying to wear way too many hats at once. By being a kids movie it weakens the message as this is squarely a message aimed at a 30+ crowd, by doing the body switch stuff it kiddifies the message, and by having Joe attain his goals only to not care was just kind of the tipping point for me the same way Inside Out is just like, “get over your depression,” in the end when you step back and look at the message it’s actually giving versus what it’s trying to say. I’ll give it a re-watch at some point, but man, I really did not like this film since it just had such poor execution of its messages.",kkbd5s

Musical score was AMAZING though, and it looked so good.

Expected the film to end with an epilogue where he's an old man and the soul comes to watch him play.",kkbd5s
ghdolfn,"I thought the movie checked all the boxes for a classic: great cast, gorgeous animation, interesting concepts and characters, and an original story. 

However, I just didn’t connect with any of the characters or the story. I didn’t have any emotional investment with any of the characters, not sure why. For example, my favorite Pixar movie is Coco, because I felt for Miguel and his family, as if I personally knew them. I also love toy story because I felt like I knew buzz and woody my entire childhood. 

For some reason, the characters in this movie never struck that chord with me. As I’m writing this down, I don’t even remember the Main protagonist’s name. I didn’t hate the movie, but I didn’t love it. Just lukewarm to it, I guess.",kkbd5s
ghg2les,"Honestly this has to be one of my favorite movies of all time. Just everything about it was perfect, the animation, the comedy, the dialogue, and most of all, the message. I'm glad I watched it alone because I allowed myself to cry twice during the movie.

Not really sure how much kids will enjoy this one though because at face value, without the message there wasn't too much adventure like a classic Pixar movie. The real adventure was experiencing one's own self which just hits more the more you live and I hope no kid can relate to the movie the same amount that adults can connect with it.",kkbd5s
ghdsqkn,I laughed out loud quite a bit - I love the way they drew Mr. Mittens and introduced the fact that he's a therapy cat. Every little cat movement of his was cracking me up.,kkbd5s
gh2r4zk,"I thought this was cute but I was overall underwhelmed by it. I mean, I didn't even cry.

I just found a lot of the Earth stuff sweet but not all that interesting. I loved the animation of the otherworldly scenes though and the Jerrys and Terry. They were fantastic and I would have gladly watched a whole film about that wildly incompetent bunch. The initial shot of The Great Beyond with the giant ball of light was just gorgeous. It is definitely visually similar to Inside Out but was much more visually interesting to me than that film. I did appreciate the message though as a 30-something stuck in a job I hate, still trying to figure out ""what I want to do with my life"" before I make a career change. I think the message will hit a lot of people. 

Fantastic soundtrack though. Loved the music for the Great Before. 

Poor cat though. It wasn't his time.",kkbd5s
gh6msij,"This was easily Pixar's most visually inventive film and incredibly funny but the concept is too ambitious and broad to be dealt with in a conventional kids film narrative (the basic formula is the same as most other Pixar films). By the end, I felt like they did very little with the concept and themes and many moments felt unearned because it's too caught up with the more conventional story here. I think Pixar films work best when they try to deal with more personal themes rather than existential ones. That's why I preferred Onward to this. The narrative is built on the idea of brotherhood and that works well with the formula. If they want to go for ambitious rather than personal, they need to ditch the buddy-comedy formula.

gh73rsx,"I had been in bands for over fifteen years, chasing that dream of writing and performing music for life. And like Joe in this movie, I ultimately found it unsatisfying. I still get sparks of inspiration; times in my life where music feels like the answer, where I just need to pick up an instrument and lose myself. But my soul was already crushed by it all. I have suffered for a number of years now with my relationship with music, how I don't find it fulfilling any more, how the emotional investment and hard work outweighs the satisfaction and joy I received from it. Theoretically this movie should hit me like a freight train of emotion, arguably moreso than it should for most people, but it doesn't. I already went through the same journey as Joe does in this movie, but instead of finding a new appreciation for the little things and enjoying life for what it is rather than what you want it to be, I found that to just weigh on my depression more. The idea that I've wasted the best years of my life chasing something unattainable, that my hopes and dreams were just as meaningless as simply existing, it's overwhelming. I don't agree that purpose and passion is fluid for everyone. It certainly isn't for me. What interests have shifted into the void left by music are no better. I still can't earn a living or establish a career out of them like Joe can with teaching. So where does that leave me and millions of others? Are we doomed to just roam the dark roiling plains of The Zone as lost souls?",kkbd5s
ghfvt2g,"It was a let-down on many fronts. The concept was over-explained and generally uninteresting, the film felt really rushed and strangely structured and had no where near the payoff of films like Inside Out or Coco. Compare the creativity of the land of the dead from Coco to the bland and sterile soul world. Even on the exploration of music and death Coco is far better than Soul. I didn't like the focus on 22 and I felt no emotional engagement to her story. I cared about Joe but I felt like he was neglected in favour of 22.

ghtssc5,"am i the only one that thought this movie was very shallow? like that beyond the message of life is great etc. there wasn't much depth to it all? maybe they thought they could fill in the gap with black representation to make the movie look a little deeper?  


I didn't get amazing characters (buzz and woody, bing bong, wall e, Carl in Up, Mike and Sully) , I didn't get enthralling worlds I wish were true (monstropolis, bug's life, etc), I didn't get particularly impressive scenes or shots (the door chase, ""so play nice"", dancing in space).

That one was really good.",kkbd5s
ghetb9v,"I was really enjoying the film but I don’t feel like it stuck the landing.

IMO, after Joe argues with 22 and she runs off, he should actually be concerned for her not just jump straight into the earth hole. Then he should have been so concerned and regretful that he messed up his gig, or at least have some moment where he realises his errors. Just would’ve added more emotional impact to him returning to the great before to help 22",kkbd5s
ghw6o0j,That ending didn’t pay off. I thought Joe’s real passion was mentoring and that’s where it would lead as him leading the You Seminars. So where did 22 wind up? Just alive? I thought she was going to be a tree lol. Inside Out was way better IMO.,kkbd5s
gh34nn7,"Idk, I thought it was ok, but the whole montage of just living life fell flat to me. Especially since most of us now miss that kind of lifestyle (normal). The whole soul thing felt too much like inside out, and it was obvious either 22 or joe was gonna become a lost soul. 

I understood joe's frustration with him finally having his dream gig, only to die, cause a lot of people work towards something like that in their lives/building their career/etc. So when he was asked to come back again, most would be like ""hell yea!"" not ""oh gee, I guess I was always living the dream!""

Also, I wish pixar/disney would have real villains again. Not those stupid twist villains, we need a real villain with understandable motives. I understand not every movie needs a villain, especially with a movie like this one, but something like frozen 2, where the main character can use magic spells (action), yeah, that needed a real villain.",kkbd5s

Doing the things that you dream about (playing trombone, performing music, having your own sewing business, etc) is way more fulfilling than being content with just living

I would’ve loved a message about how your dreams can change, and that’s perfectly fine. For example, the barber who wanted to be a vet but instead was able to take care of hisdaughter, or the mom who dreamt about a life about her husband, but when he died, is able to continue his legacy and dreams through her son. Instead it was just... doing nothing in life is okay, and even glorified? Meh

I don't know that Joe should have died necessarily, but for him to go through an incredible existential journey for the whole story only to be given a second chance at life and then when asked what he was gonna do with his life he basically just shrugged with an ""I dunno""...I really wanted his end story to pay off more about being a teacher. HE'S BEEN TEACHING 22 THE WHOLE MOVIE! I actually wouldn't have minded an extra 20-30 minutes runtime to see how he ends up, staying with teaching, performing professionally or both.

gh1qo3n,"Well I really didn’t like Soul that much. Joe didn’t get enough screentime before the accident to get invested in him and I dunno to me the Soul World stuff was pretty lacklustre and not all that visually appealing. The humour was very hit and miss for the most part and once the cat body swap plot happened it just felt very generic and by the numbers for a big chunk of the runtime. I feel like the Pixar formula is starting to get repetitive and I was thinking it was kind of repeating similar beats to Inside Out. They then ruin the potentially good ending with him going back to his body once again! Everything with Joe and 22 was setting up for him to leave with his soul, but nope just give him a happy ending out of thin air. I was so annoyed by that I dropped my rating from a 5/10 to a 4/10.

gh4rc33,"So is ""your spark"" an actual thing or is it just the joy of life?  Like is your spark specifically ""piano"" because it makes life worth living for you, or is ""piano"" just one of life's many wonders that helps awaken your spark?  

I don't know how best to phrase it but maybe someone understands what I'm asking.  Basically is ""piano"" or ""pizza"" the spark or does ""finding your spark"" mean ""finding the will to live"" and the things that get you there aren't the spark; the feeling is the spark?",kkbd5s

gh9e2fv,"Is it just me but when 22 decided they wanted to keep Joe’s body when they’re supposed to meet up with Moonwind, it was fucked up right? 22 was sending the message their new life was more important than Joe’s ACTUAL life. That killed my sympathy for 22 pretty fast.",kkbd5s
gh1ygul,"I felt like the whole movie was building up to that line by Jerry, “Your spark isn’t your purpose.” I loved this movie, but I was a little thrown by this message.

gh1v67e,"What was the meaning of the movie though? What was 22's spark? She just loves living? I'm sorry but loving living doesn't pay the bills. Once she discovers how corrupt the system is and how the poor stay poor. She will have another meaningless life full of sadness just like Joe Gardner did when they were both inside his memories. 22 legit called his life sad. So why did she all of a sudden change her mind? The movie and animation are great, but I think the messaging is sloppy. People will still be confused on who they are and what they want to be in the world. And it doesnt help when the government doesn't give a crap about their own wellbeing of their citizens.",kkbd5s

gh4ptq3,"i feel there was a version of this movie where it was centered on 22 (voiced by a white woman) a soul that didn’t want to live a life, only to discover the magic of life with the help of a recently deceased black man. 

basically driving miss daisy in the after life. 

i’m glad instead of getting all tropey with the magical black man , they instead reframed the story to focus on the character who would usually be the supporting role in the past, and that was a nice twist.",kkbd5s
gh79x2n,"This was a big disappointment for me. Not even the best Pixar movie of the year.

Inside Out did such a great job blending the fantasy world with the real one, but with Soul it kinda feels like two seperate realities being forced together. There is no cohesion. The entire soul thing didn't make much sense since joe wasn't even close to being dead. How can he just zone out and go back to the soul world?

I wouldn't say the characters were very good either. There was some decent chemistry between Joe and 22 but I didn't find myself rooting for either of them.

The big epiphany moment felt a bit forced. After one night he has that realisation? They could have done a little montage or something. It felt really rushed. It's a shame because the moral of the story was great in principle, but I wasn't invested enough for it to have much of an emotional impact.

I did enjoy some of the humour and the barber shop scene was excellent. Overall though,  just an okay movie and near the bottom of the Pixar catalogue for me.",kkbd5s
gh38ui6,"Bawled so hard my head hurt afterwards. Just turned 30 this year and this movie hit very close to home. When Joe realizes his spark doesn’t equal his purpose, and that “living” can be comprised of the seemingly small moments in your day-to-day life... really resonated with me.",kkbd5s
ghh1vmo,"Just watched it. Is it just me or it's very patronizing/pandering?

This is pretty much saying ""don't push yourself too hard"", ""accept your limitations"" ""enjoy the little things"" then ""you'll feel much better about your life"". Are you kidding me? We live in a society where the rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer, inequality, racial/social injustice, climate crisis the list goes on and on. There are so many problems we need to solve and you are telling people to feel good for what they have and just ""enjoy the little things"" and ""you don't need a purpose""?

The most ironic thing is when clearly the black/brown communities are at the center of inequality/racial injustice and you are telling us they just need to ""enjoy the little things""?

Things like the barber’s beard and the wood of Joe’s bass in his apartment were just stunning. One of my favorite Pixar films in a long time. Really beautiful and a lot of fun.,kkbd5s
gh1juwt,Just want to say Reznor and Ross absolutely killed it with the score. All the music in general was top notch.,kkbd5s
gh1ko4j,I loved this movie because I think it really makes you take a step back and examine your own life. It’s a great reminder that we shouldn’t get too caught up in the daily stressors.

There were things I had to ignore—like presumably he hit his head when he fell, yet there was no indication of bodily harm, nor was his mother alerted by the hospital when he’s basically dying (assuming she’s his medical contact). There were a few instances like that, but it’s such a beautiful film that it’s easy to ignore these things. It kind of felt like a spin-off to Inside Out, or existed within that universe, albeit a bit more complex. Also, I need to know if the cat spirit got yanked out of the great beyond and thrown back to earth.",kkbd5s

gh1wp8e,Idk if anyone has mentioned this but I was waiting to see how 22 would look like as a person when her soul got to earth. Such a bummer they didn’t show that but such an amazing movie overall. 10/10 for me,kkbd5s
gh1x1n6,"This is an amazing movie. Reminded me a lot of Coco. People are saying it's an adult movie and wouldn't have succeeded in theatres but I disagree. The lessons about enjoying life are great for children and it makes the concepts of death, souls, and life easy to explain. 

Also love the portrayed of Black culture in NY. It hasn't heavy handed or in your face about it, it was just straight forward good background and plot design. Not a big fan of Jazz or piano but I liked the music too. 

It's a 9/10 for me easily. I really did enjoy it a lot, the marketing sold it short and I'm glad I gave it a go. Plot was a bit fast paced but I liked it. 

For anyone who hadn't seen it yet, go for it. You'll enjoy it a lot.",kkbd5s

gh1y6f2,Can anyone tell me if kids can watch it? I know it is animation but wondering if it is appropriate for little kids.,kkbd5s
gh1y9pu,"Wow what a great movie to end the year. When he starts playing music and he remembers not only his time with 22 but the small things in life that 22 appreciated, he harkens back on the same little things that made him happy. As a person approaching their 30s who’s always struggling to find ‘their purpose’ you could say, this film really resonated with me. There’s much to gain from just living rather than pursuing a results oriented lifestyle. Love this movie!",kkbd5s
gh1ynws,"I loved this so very much. It's masterful on so many levels: the perfect balance between gorgeous photorealism (what a love letter to NYC) and beautifully expressive character animation, the wonderful writing (packed full of both jokes and wisdom), and fantastic music throughout (the climactic performance at the club! goddamn).

If I could nitpick one thing, it might be that the ending felt a bit abrupt. Part of me wonders what it would've looked like if Pixar really swung for the fences and ended with Joe's sacrifice instead of giving him a second chance. Too dark on paper, I know, but what if he lived out more of his life before his epiphany/sacrifice? We could see a montage of Joe getting a bit disillusioned with his new life as a successful performer, maybe a time skip to a noticeably older Joe, who then has his epiphany to go and save 22. Letting Joe live out more of his life could soften the darkness of making his sacrifice permanent.

That said, I totally understand why they didn't go that route, and I still can't wait to watch it again. I just can't help thinking how ambitious and powerful it could be if Pixar pulled off giving an optimistic outlook on being at peace with death after a fulfilled life.",kkbd5s

I think this movie just saved my life...",kkbd5s

gh239fa,"I'm curious if kids will really love this one or resonate with it. It asks a lot of interesting questions about purpose, personality, and what happens to us before and after. Personally, I loved it and thought this went the Ratatouille route of what is art and what drives us to pursuit it. It's beautiful and fun. 

I'm sad that I couldn't see this in the theater to admire the wonderful animation on the big screen.",kkbd5s
gh23kg1,"So it took me 2 viewings to truly appreciate the film.

My first viewing, I thought it was good. The only issues I had with it were that I thought the middle of the plot dragged a bit, and that the ending was abrupt. The message of the film also had not really hit my core yet. I got what the film was trying to say, but it didn't;t hit me in the gut like other have.

However, on my second viewing, I loved the film even more. Going into the movie, know what to expect really made easier to digest everything and pick up on some of the cues I may have missed. This time I around, I didn't think the middle part of the plot dragged. The barbershop scene hit me especially hard, because there are most people who want to pursue their passions in life, but other circumstances come up that prevent them from doing that. And near the end, when Joe is told ‘your spark isn’t your purpose in life, it’s what makes you want to live’ hit me in the gut like no-one else's business. It showed me that you can enjoy the beauty of life without making something revolve around it. 

Now when it came to the end the second time around, I still felt it was abrupt. I think if Disney really wanted to give everybody a true gut punch, they should've let Joe die, but I get why they didn't do that. 

Overall, this really felt like Inside Out, but for adults. Soul is something that we really needed right now during this hell-scape we call 2020. It for sure deserves all the love and praise it gets.",kkbd5s
gh24kh0,"What an amazing movie. At least for me, it was the most personally touching, (but not the most emotional) Pixar movie, as a person with depression. It makes me look inwards at myself and my life and it truly does give me a different perspective on life. I feel like the character work was a little rushed and not super developed, (except for that of Joe, of course) but it’s portrayal of the theme is absolutely great. 10/10, although it won’t, it totally deserves a best picture nomination, especially since this is a weaker year for movies",kkbd5s
gh24qjj,"Holy crap this movie is a masterpiece. I did not expect to have that powerful an experience watching it. But that’s the thing, you don’t just watch a movie like this. This is the kind of film which engages many other senses beyond vision. I am blown away. That scene right after the “Disney Pictures” text at the beginning where Joe’s soul falls through the void on its way to the before world was genius. Watched it 3 times in a row lol.",kkbd5s

gh24vs4,"Such I shame I won't see Soul on a big cinema screen.

I also think Soul was the best Pixar since Inside Out, that was also directed by Peter Doctor.",kkbd5s
gh26eq6,"As someone who is dealing with depression and been trying to avoid looking at others' successes on social media and online... This movie hit pretty hard. 

Thank you Pixar for delivering a wonderful movie. I went in expecting to not like it as much as other movies but it's definitely near the top for me.",kkbd5s
gh2bdd2,"

I've been looking forward to see this one pretty much all year, sad I didn't get to see it in cinemas, since it is no doubt top tier Pixar.

The visual style of warmly lit New York and The Great Before are top notch, I was worried that the film was going to ignore one in favour of the other, but the movie splits it time between them very well, loved the score as well.

It's also the funniest film Pixar have made in a long while, and they blend the comedy really well with the mature themes. The ending and message of the film took a direction that I wasn't really expecting. I think I'll need to rewatch it to know how I fully feel about it.",kkbd5s

gh2tkmt,"The movie was amazing, at the beginning I had my doubts (the thing about Big Before and Later sounds a little weird), but later the interactions between 22 and Joe changed my mind, it was pure gold, it's like Inside Out but with a deeper message and I loved it, life is beyond goals, you can enjoy it without worrying about these and the movie does a great job explaining it",kkbd5s

ghdhdzq,"Very conflicted about this film.

It’s gorgeous, thought-provoking, has wonderful sound design, and interesting concepts and characters. The pacing, structure, and focus are where it struggles for me.

Joe does not work for me as a protagonist. We spend the entire movie trying to get what he wants, and it turns out to be as unimportant to him as it is to the audience. It’s like if Buzz Lightyear had been the focus instead of Woody. I think making 22 the protagonist would have improved all the issues and made for a stronger film, but it’s still a pretty good watch regardless.",kkbd5s
ghif858,"This is a movie that won't get a lot of attention or maybe isn't as perfect as it could be.  But this is 100% one of those movies that will get better with time.  Think ""Christmas Story"" type of popularity arc.

The viewers who don't relate to the story jist haven't quite hit that point in their life where they wonder ""What was it all for?"" because they are smack middle in driving for their goal or are too young or whatever.


But the thematic lessons of the movie will eventually apply to everyone as they go through life.",kkbd5s
ghjno7v,"I’m gonna come back to go deeper into this but I gotta get this off my chest. 

22 is not a pitiable character at that end. They’re a little terror who’s taken extreme pleasure in making others miserable, being difficult, and hurting feelings. They mock everything Joe likes, then have the nerve to attempt to steal his body. I felt like it was super shitty that he was illustrated as the biggest monster. What he said was more ignorant than cruel. Not to mention everything said to 22 in all the flashbacks was AFTER 22 treated them horribly because of their own insecurity that they wouldn’t be good enough for earth.",kkbd5s
gh1tz63,"Just finished watching, I thought it was actually pretty good but Coco was probably better. A few things I had to kinda critique as a nobody who likes animated movies.

1. I was glad they didn’t spend “too” much time in the animated world, I liked the whole concept of things but wished they went a little more complex with the animation, it felt idk.... simple? Which is the point but I kinda wish it was more daring you know?

2. Joe being the cat obviously had its narrative purposes but it was super eye rolling to have another black character turning into an animal or something, maybe just make him a voice in his own head or something? Idk small critique.

3. It felt a little too safe and predictable. It was done really well with an amazing score and animation but i could see every message coming a mile away. The movie never did anything “surprising” to me, like it felt like they had a concept and went with the most safe obvious rout with it. Not a bad thing, but again, it just felt like it was missing something. 

Overall a pretty good Pixar movie. Maybe not up there with the greatest ones but I’d recommend it to anyone who liked Inside Out.",kkbd5s
gh1z55i,"The funniest joke to me wasn't the Knicks joke, but the George Orwell joke. Its the truth, man. This movie was low key a scathing criticism of our education system. It's more concerned about making us into perfect little cogs to fit into the capitalist machine (like that lost soul hedge fund guy). Where do you think we get the ideas of ""success = happiness"" and ""you need to have a life's purpose in order for your life to have meaning"" come from? 

Those ideas are suppose to make us work harder in society, but at what cost? You lose sight of the stuff that's important in life, outside of working and success.",kkbd5s

It's technically well made, and has some great ideas. I loved the idea of the zone and the funk being essentially the same thing. I really think it feels like a lecture on how you should feel. Idk it's not exactly that but a similar feeling. I'll probably vet a pixar movie next time, instead of blindly trusting it to be great

This was a good movie, but not the level of good I have come to expect from the makers of coco",kkbd5s
gh41gib,"I thought the exposition at the beginning of the film was too rushed, to the point where I didn’t really care that much about Joe’s desire to return to the living world. I fee like the movie should have spent more time at the beginning showing us why Joe is unhappy with teaching, where his passion for music comes from, and why the gig with Dorothea is so important.",kkbd5s
gh2yi7h,"About 15 minutes into the movie, I literally turned to my mother and went “whoa this movie is adult”. I was really surprised how this movie really was heavily geared towards kids. This, to me, was for the adult Pixar Disney fans. They concepts in this movie really are something you don’t start to grasp until you get more mature. I really appreciate that they didn’t pander. It was a great film. I love jazz and I have been waiting for this movie since I saw the first teaser 1.5 years ago. They also did a great job with all of the historical references and pop culture references as well. My parents, who are pretty anti-animation, were transfixed. They really loved it. 

I have to say this movie probably landed a bit different, if not better, because of this year.",kkbd5s

Is the great beyond the place the people from Coco go when they die? Or is that just for Mexican people who partake is Dia De Los Muertos? 

Also, if the seminar is where they get their personalities,  then how are the islands of personality created like we saw in Inside Out? Also, where would the emotions come into things, I assume just after birth like we saw in Inside Out",kkbd5s

gh8kr2p,"I wasn't a big fan of this film, unfortunately.  I had a lot of hope for this film, but by the end I was left wanting.

They brought up Lisa twice in the film, but that seemed to go nowhere.

The cats soul was displaced and seemed to be heading off to void, but when Joe leaves the cats body, the cat just returns to normal.

Ultimately this felt like Tina Fey's version of Inside Out, but for me it didn't strike the same chords where I'd watch it multiple times to see subtle things like the color of emotional or placement of emotions.",kkbd5s
gi04mhr,"Not so much moved to tears as bored to tears. I found the soul-administration conceit tedious, the plot painfully obvious, the characters dull, the jokes weak and the ending a dud. 22 is one of Pixar's worst characters, a stubborn misanthrope I feel like we've seen a hundred times before, and Joe is nothingy, a collection of a few traits that don't come together as a cohesive character. Even the wordplay in the film's title is incoherent, as the film isn't about soul music at all, it's about jazz! But hey, both are Black music genres, right guys?

My biggest gripe is with the plotting. It was implausible that Joe was instantly bored with his new pianist gig, an absolutely ridiculous plot point that they shoved through before you could think too much about it. It's work! Work is by its very nature repetitive. For god's sake Joe. That's life! Then Joe becoming the first and only soul to get a second chance at life is an insult to the millions of people who have died before they got their chance. I felt like he really, really needed to accept his death. Also, the way Joe deliberately fell into the Zone and then jumped off stood out as being painfully inconsistent with the netherworld's logic.

The things I liked included Richard Ayoade and Rachel House's performances; Dez the barber; some much-needed Black representation in the Pixar canon; and the cut-away gags, which got a few laughs out of me.

Overall, I found *Soul* is Pixar at its most saccharine and over-elaborate. The film's aim to draw out a universal truth about humanity was instead expressed as something simplistic and reductive.",kkbd5s
ghwulyi,"I think they tried to have too many things going on in this movie. They have established two different worlds (living and the great before). Then we start exploring the great before which contains other “worlds” and characters which we don’t really explore further, just leave there. So we go back to the alive world without having explored much further. 
So we are back on earth for some unclear purpose for 22, and a very clear purpose but vague means to it for Joe. How in the world can he imagine get to his gig in the evening while stil being a cat? But at the same time 22 is enjoying life, fair enough. But still thought it was unclear to the audience what was happening all along with 22. 22 needs a spark? No; but seems to enjoy est a pizza and listening to music; but is it because she/he is inside of joe? 
There are just too many question marks all the time. 
I was watching the movie with my boyfriend and we usually try to give guesses at how things will resolve along the movie. None of our guesses happened. Many of them just never got a solution by the movie plot and just stayed hanging. 
Too many doors opened and never closed. 
The end did not feel satisfying. Watching a Disney/Pixar in my world should make me feel wholesome and satisfied at the end of the movie. Here, we just felt incomplete and full of questions. Thst is not the usual feel; I would rather have that watching a thriller movie, not Disney Pixar.
However, I salut the great animation work; all the textures from the pullover of Joe to the glance of the saxophone 😘👍 also the creativity of the artists working in this movie, creating all these different styles of worlds and and characters. Incorporating 2D characters in a 3D world; how brilliant !
Working myself in UI, I was amazing of the colors in each world. 
Uncanny valley also was interesting to see on earth; between high level of detail of the world itself and the clearly unreal human visual definition.
It is a great piece of work guys; I must admit. But plot wise left me and my boyfriend uncomplete.",kkbd5s

gh1o6qa,"I’m a jazz musician who lives in NYC so this was absolute magic for me.  My favorite Pixar film and honestly my favorite movie I’ve seen in as long as I can remember.  It was conceptually brilliant, the afterlife was so gorgeously animated, it had just the right balance of humor and heft, and the portrayal of New York was so spot-on.  

I also absolutely loved that it offered such a refreshing, nuanced message, especially for a kids’ film (though I’d say this may be Pixar’s most adult entry - on similar footing to Inside Out in that regard, I think).  It was an honest subversion of the played-out “if you don’t have one true passion, your life is meaningless” and “you are a failure if you don’t truly follow your dreams” narratives, but it never came across as cynical or defeatist.

Also, I know this movie really made me cry and I’ve heard others say the same, but the viewing experience felt quite personal.  There were the scenes at the end with Joe reflecting on his life and saving 22’s lost soul at the end, but it didn’t have the one huge tearjerker moment like, say, the opening montage in Up or Miguel singing to his dying great-grandmother in Coco - just a lot of really great emotional beats throughout.  The first scene where he’s improvising at the club and the scene where the trombone player shows up to Joe’s apartment to quit and then psychs herself out of it really spoke to me, so it makes me wonder if there are more of those scenes that other people noticed or that will stand out during a rewatch.",kkbd5s
gh279g1,"I checked out just after the bit with Joe and the Cat. Went and took a nap instead. 

The asides with 22 and the other mentors were gold, same with the ""Zone"" people, and I really liked how Terry and the Jerrys resembled the abstract Disney cartoons from the 1950s, but from what I saw, it felt like a bunch of disconnected set pieces. The overall story was kind of ""meh"".

Wall-E, Up and Toy Story 2, for me, are peak Pixar, all else is lesser.",kkbd5s
gh2epsj,"Thought this was incredible, and it easily places amongst the top tier Pixar for me. There wasn't as strong of a ""cry"" moment like Coco or Inside Out, but man that scene at the piano with 22's trinkets... just a wave of melancholy washed over me, so moving.

I was in TEARS by some of the jokes. All the mentor bits were really good, with Abraham Lincoln being my personal favorite. Loved the throwaway line with the hippie's names, Dreamflower flowerdreamer or something. The joke about the new soul being a megalomaniac I took as an indirect shot as Trump (especially with the imagery of 22 in the Oval Office just a couple of minutes later), but I could be reading too much into it.

As a cat owner I loved all the cat jokes as well. That narrative twist took me completely by surprise, but I was really happy it did. Staying in the soul world would have felt too much like Inside Out for me, and I'm glad we got a chance to explore NYC and the black neighborhood. 

The only thing that didn't completely work for me was how Joe calmed down 22 from her lost soul form. The ""lesson"" resonated strongly with me, but I think the execution of it was a tad bit wonky. Minor gripes at the end of the day, everything else worked so well. Absolutely beautiful. 9/10",kkbd5s

gi4kzw9,"i didnt really get the movie. Seemed like Joe at the end realised music wasn't the end goal in life, and he was going to appreciate life itself or ""regular old living"".

Seemed contrary to the entire setup of the movie e.g. the tired people on the subway, people rushing to their jobs on the streets of NY like drones, Joe realising that accepting a full time job would likely be the end of his dream to become a full time musician. 

The ending just seemed like a cop out, the idea that the solution was just to express gratitude for the little things seemed like it came from some sort of fairy land...

givfdzg,[removed],kkbd5s
gqqg2tq,"If you enjoyed the movie, please don't read what I have to say.

You've been warned.

So let's talk about the highlights first:

- obviously, the animation was beautiful. It was visually creative, the human and even cat movements were incredibly lifelike, and they clearly paid a lot of attention to detail on expressions, skin tones, hair texture, etc.

- the music was a great representation of jazz culture, and helped narrate the story of unexplainable passion and connection to something metaphysical deep within ourselves

- the clear message of how damaging it can be to disregard how big or how little a passion or purpose can be to someone still in the journey to finding themselves

..... K, now that the Disney ""feel goods"" have been mentioned, here's where I have a LOT of issues with this movie:

1. If you're going to be so bold to call out that 22 is voiced by a ""middle aged white lady"" then let me dig at this a little bit because to me, that explanation of her using her voice to ""annoy people"" has a purpose for being added into the script.

Disney clearly made a conscious choice to use a ""white lady"" to represent a soul that houses pretty much all of human knowledge throughout time, and doesn't care -- much like how white people are responsible for colonizing and indoctrinating the whole planet and don't care about how it damaged indigineous and sovereign countries everywhere.

You even get to see 22 ""mess with"" souls that are ""in the zone"" -- the Knicks joke especially -- cute way to joke about how white supremacy basically controls who advances and who doesn't even when they're fully in their element.

She's clearly unappreciative of all of her experiences and knowledge because she ""doesn't have a purpose"" because for her, she needed to be physically in touch with the planet to start giving a shit about it.

Sorry, but if that didn't give out ""Get Out"" vibes to anyone else, then perhaps the glittery Disney magic did its job by blowing magic and meme references at you to distract you.

2. You really can't convince me that this was written from a ""poor man's"" perspective, because that man is working 80+ hours a week just trying to SURVIVE. Even Joe Gardner doesn't fit the ""every man"" in 2020 (try maybe 1995 when there was still a middle class) as relatable as they tried to make him by being a middle school band teacher.

ALSO --- this weird false narrative that teachers are looked down on in the music industry like theyre jokes is a bit caricaturistic and outdated -- with most of the working class being the millennial generation now, none of us who have made it into the music industry would ever roll our eyes at a teacher breaking out. This is a toxic and hyperbolic representation of how musicians are with each other (speaking as a musician and music teacher my damn self) and people who act like Dorothea are QUICKLY getting phased out and are irrelevant precisely for that gatekeeping attitude. Way to show how ""in touch"" you are with the people, Disney. You did so great with Mulan.

3. Delving deeper behind the Disney ""warm and fuzzy"" mirage -- stop fucking telling people they need to ""stop and smell the roses"" when you CLEARLY KNOW the level of stress and anxiety that people get to DEBILITATES THEM from seeing the ""bigger picture.""

You know what thats like? That's like the emporer telling the pillars of an empire to ""take a break"" but not let the empire fall. It doesn't work like that. And giant conglomerate companies like Disney who have the power to vacuum up every other independently standing creative industry out there -- you fucking know this, and its disgustingly sick and twisted.

Why did you make light of the megalomaniac soul? Why did you make 5 insecure souls and 12 arrogant ones? Why do you keep subtly pointing out that the assholes and jerks and powerful are the ones that get all the benefit of human suffering -- INCLUDING 22??

This whole movie felt like a passive aggressive stab from the delusional 1% down to the ""lowly people"" to be grateful they get to smell B.O. on a subway cause ""that's what living is all about"" -- if that's the case, THEN REDISTRIBUTE YOUR FUCKING WEALTH so we can ALL enjoy the spinny leaf falling from the autumn tree and NOT think about how we're going to keep our family together or our rent paid.

This isn't coming from a perspective of someone ""poor"" btw. I come from a long line of generational wealth that has been complicit for centuries on hammering in this idea that ""life exists for us"" and that we're here to simply experience it all.

Yes, this is true -- the problem is, YOU, THE WEALTHY AND UNBOTHERED, are the ones setting the narrative and agenda for EVERYONE THE FUCK ELSE to live as YOU would see as ""fulfilling"" and ""meaningful"" because you think that people are just ""ungrateful"" for their mediocre lives.

No. JOE GARDNER was ungrateful. He doesn't get to represent people who love music for music. He represents people who use music to validate their egos.

The fact that he gets a ""second chance"" AFTER SUBMITTING HIS LIFE TO A BRATTY WHITE WOMAN IS NOT FUCKING INSPIRING.

ghtvv2p,"Even with Pixar films that are considered duds, the attempt to create something unique was present. They tried something, and mostly it worked great, sometimes it failed, but it's ok.

This film really made me feel like they took the most formulaic plot and just decorated it with typical Pixar elements. The emphasis on Black culture didn't feel integral to the film's message, and I really wanted to see more of it. 

There was no deeper elaboration on the fact that everyone has predetermined main emotions, and they just make hundreds of kids depressed, or happy and it's totally random. I would've loved to see the thought process in The Great Before too.

The lead characters, while likable, didn't stand out at all for me. Maybe that's the point with Joe, but the fact that 22 hated Earth life and then came to Earth for a few hours and saw the common beauty and loved it, is just the most straightforward result and is very forgettable.

Soem really touching moments but you could always see what was going to happen, think it would've been better if he didn't get a 2nd chance but it's not a good ending.

One thing for sure is that they're pushing the limits of animation, the ending montage especially was amazing to see.

Man, that ending would have been just so perfect and I was so ready for it.

I don't know if it's because I'm a lecturer at a university and I was just grading papers before I saw the movie but it kinda sends the message to kids that you can always make exceptions and while it seems like the right and humane thing to do at first glance, it totally breaks down at scale and quickly evolves into corruption.

This was definitely an extremely ambitious project with the subject matter but it turned out beautifully.

gh2zjsr,Really enjoyed this one.  Whole family was into it.,kkbd5s

gh3dobx,Man this movie was super spiritual and powerful. I loved it!,kkbd5s
ghftyfn,"I really liked the movie. I have It at 8/10 

The story or message was kind of confusing at times and certain implications were kind of bizarre, but it’s a kids movie so It gets pretty silly to overthink It.",kkbd5s
ghmcqoz,"Was a great film! That montage towards the end of the film where he reminisces about his upbringing was emotional as hell and I loved it. 

https://youtu.be/Mwkj3JaWCIA  

Check out this review it was great",kkbd5s
gh3v1ms,One of Pixar’s best films. Pete Docter is a fantastic director and this is probably his best directorial Pixar film. The voice acting is all really well done across the board and it is one of the most visually impressive Pixar films,kkbd5s
ghf5cvo,This movie replaced Up and Monster's Inc as my favorite Pixar films. I got super emotional and cried during the little moments scene. The soundtrack with Trent and Atticus was dope too.,kkbd5s
gmc8tkq,The movie is literally a copy and paste of wreck it ralph's story,kkbd5s
gh1jx0y,"It might be too early to say this, but I think this is top 3 Pixar for me, along with Coco and Inside Out. Absolutely loved the barbershop scene and the scene where Joe composes the song while looking at 22's objects / the purpose of life. Brought me to tears multiple times. Loved it and can't wait to rewatch.",kkbd5s
gh1jx8a,honestly featuring one of the best Knicks jokes I have ever seen,kkbd5s
gh1kdhm,"Great movie. 

The wife and I watched it and the film’s answer to purpose resonated very deeply with both of us. Especially with everything going on these days. Loved it.",kkbd5s
gh1ko47,Great movie. Enjoyed the concept and the follow through. Took the horrible memory of wonder woman out of my head,kkbd5s
gh1kozc,Goddammit Pixar. 🥲,kkbd5s
gh1ky6g,"The score was beautiful and the animation did an amazing job at displaying something indescribable. I love how they were able to portray the fact that one’s passion does not necessarily translate into their purpose. We aren’t predestined with a path laid out for us, everyone has to find their way in this world even if it requires a lot of help along the way. What a beautiful sentiment.

There were also some hilarious jokes in the mix to keep it light, it was great imagining the main character talking to himself while a cat was mrowling right next to him!

What a ride.",kkbd5s
gh1l026,I'm sure people will pick at it but me and my family loved it. Really enjoyable. Honestly didn't know which way it was going to land and I was happy to be along for the journey. Great stuff.,kkbd5s
gh1l3mg,"Man, absolutely amazing film. I felt like the ending could have used more of a resolution, but overall it was one of Pixar's finest. The visuals were incredible, they capturing the spirit of NYC perfectly, and the jokes were funny too.",kkbd5s
gh1l8zc,This is one of my favorite movies. Just amazing,kkbd5s
gh1ldmf,"This movie has really touched me. I always find myself to struggle with what I want to do in life, what my passions are. In a way, like a lost soul. I feel.. Free for some reason. As that I should not take life so serious. What an impact this movie made. I'm a big Pixar fan and they hit it out of the park. Easily one of my favorites now. It may even be my #1 fav. Wow!",kkbd5s
gh1le71,"Amazing movie. I was really impressed by how well it tackled the perceived corporeal trippiness of higher planes of existence and the heady message of taking even the most minor joys and frustrations of real life in stride. My only complaint is that there were maaaaaybe one too many Family Guy-style cutaway gags that didn’t really fit in with everything else? But in all in all it’s a minor quibble in regards to everything else on display here.

I should also mention that the animation on the Jerrys (and Terry) was PHENOMENAL for a mainstream animated film. It’s neat to see Pixar finally start to step out of its comfort zone under Pete Docter’s reigns!",kkbd5s
gh1ljkx,"Man. They changed a lot do this from the early synopsis. 

I swear I read something about Joe going to
Be a dad. Daveed Diggs was going to be Joe’s rival. 

But I digress.  


It was a pretty good movie.",kkbd5s
gh1mq7u,"Evidently, John Ratzenberger isn’t in this film. Which marks the first time he isn’t in a Pixar film. Unless he’s under a pseudonym, he’s completely absent.

It’s a shame, but I think there have been times where his presence took me out of the film (Onward being a good example) but, others where it really helped the film, like in Inside Out where it sort of sets a mood for the film wrapping up.

Sooner or later he wouldn’t have been in a film, so it’s not a huge deal.",kkbd5s
gh1mxyd,"If you enjoyed this film and it’s message of enjoying life for all its little moments, you should check out Patterson. Similarly beautiful and life-affirming. Plus it has Kylo Ren!",kkbd5s
gh1nfh6,"Dangit Soul, thanks for reminding me of all the tasty food I’m missing out on at NYC!",kkbd5s
gh1nrn8,Bravo Disney. I wish I could have seen Soul in the theater but I have to give props to Disney for allowing Pixar to make a film that's made purely to be a good film and not a vehicle to sell toys. Just what I needed for 2020.,kkbd5s
gh1ntae,Worth it for the Knicks and Piss cup jokes.,kkbd5s
gh1nuk7,"Watching Soul with my family was a unique experience that I'm greateful to have had. I've struggled with ambitions and coming to terms that I am unlikely to be famous/successful, however it's the small moments with my family and closest friends that make life truly happy.

The scene after Joe returns from his music performance and relieves his memories with his dad, mum and friends, accompanied by the stellar musiv was absolutely beautiful. 

I really liked how they focussed on music for Joe, as traditionally music is thought to be part of a humans soul. However Pixar, Pete Docter and his team moved away from only music and focussed on the bigger aspects of life.

An absolute 10/10 from me and I loved every minute of it.",kkbd5s
gh1nuwe,Rare where we get a real happy ending. Pixar usually hits us with the cold hard truth.  Glad he got a second chance though. 10/10.,kkbd5s
gh1nz9o,I want to know what the drug budget was for whoever designed the before and characters models.,kkbd5s
gh1o20k,"I’m glad the writers decided to let Joe live in the end. The movie’s core message would have worked whether he lived or died, but that brief ending scene of him stepping outside his door with a new outlook was a necessary call to action for the audience, especially younger viewers who may not be able to fully apply a less concrete ending to their own lives. 

In any case, I think that straightforward message is exactly what we all needed in these times. We were all Joe in that moment.",kkbd5s
gh1o5bh,"What stuck out for me in this film was how even if you fulfill your purpose that moment won't feel as momentous as you imagined it would be. Just another day in your life. A highlight sure, but the next day will arrive, with changes, and yet your experience of it all is relatively the same.

I also wanna point out that people who have acid trips put random stuff in their pocket cause they are fascinated by every minute detail of life.",kkbd5s
gh1o74p,I want a full feature length film of 22 pissing off every single historical figure,kkbd5s
gh1ob5g,the pivotal scene is basically another version of the this is water anecdote david foster wallace uses in that graduation speech,kkbd5s
gh1occ8,"This might be the first movie since Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind that I just felt completely emotional throughout the whole film.  I did not know what the movie was about except that it was related to jazz and music so I was completely blind to the fact that the movie was about death. The way they handled the topic and the philosophy on the purpose of life was masterfully done. And the animation was just brilliant from how photo realistic NYC looked to the before/afterlife and transcendental beings, just fantastic! I didn’t think it was possible for me to cry that much and have an existential crisis from one movie.",kkbd5s
gh1oj8v,"Amazing film. As someone who just had their first child a month ago I had it hit me especially deep. Just looking at his face and seeing an already full personality makes you really question: ""Where did we come from, why are we here, and where are we going?""

Whether or not you believe in religion or spirituality it really makes you take the message though of living every moment.",kkbd5s
gh1ol96,"I get what the movie was trying to do, but I think either A. joe should stay dead or B. Show more what he does after.

I am sure people will disagree but think he should have taken one of those 2 paths and by trying to do a middle ground it made for a weaker ending.

Film was still brilliant and beautiful though.",kkbd5s
gh1ow28,"Really want sure what to think going in, and I also wasn’t really planning on watching it.

My dad had it on and I decided to sit down and watch it.

The scenes that really got to me were 22 just soaking in the little things of life, Joe at his piano after the gig, and Joe finishing the gig and going “now what?”.

The scene where Joe finally reaches his goal of landing and playing the gig and then feeling empty when it’s over really spoke to me.

I was up last night writing in my journal, and one of the things I was writing about was how I think that while goals are important to have in life, they shouldn’t be your primary reason for living.

So Joe coming to a similar conclusion was a weird coincidence hahaha.

I need to rewatch it, but from what I saw I really enjoyed it.",kkbd5s
gh1p4ds,"I loved this movie, to me it’s Pixar’s strongest film since probably ratatouille or up. Though, and I don’t say this as a critique at all, I can’t really imagine kids being super into this movie. It feels less like a kids movie that adults can also enjoy, and just feels like a “real film”. I’m sure stuff like 22 ripping Joes pants will get a laugh out of kids, but I can’t imagine kids latching onto these characters like I did with Finding Nemo and The Incredibles.  I’d love to hear from parents who watched this movie with their kids about how their kids reacted to the movie.  Pixar films have always been smart as well as funny and cute, but this, coco, even toy story 4, have begun to show Pixar has the ability, and also trust in their audience, to get into some pretty intense themes.  I think what’s most impressive though is how well Soul manages to stick the landing. It raises so many questions, lays out so many possible paths for Joe to take, and the way it plays out manages to be both extremely satisfying without sounding contrived at all. Like even though “jerry” starts off as basically comedic relief, by the end we can understand why they, an incomprehensibly powerful being, would care about Joe’s fate.  Between the way it conveys being in the flow and exploring 22s insecurities, the amount of *genuine heart* in this movie cannot be understated. Can’t wait to watch it again.",kkbd5s
gh1p4q9,"Okay, I've been waiting all day for this thread to ask this but, you know that bloopy music that plays whenever Terry is in pursuit? I swear I've heard that before in various youtube videos. Is this some well known piece of music or did Pixar use one of the royalty free youtube songs for Terry's theme?",kkbd5s
gh1p95g,Best movie i seen this year. It had me feeling happy and loving life when it ended. Such a beautiful movie....already in my top 3 of all time for pixar...been thinking about since i watched it 10 hours ago.,kkbd5s
gh1p9oa,I found this move so beautiful and exactly what I needed to see/hear at the end of 2020 <3,kkbd5s
gh1pdzk,"Graham Norton and Richard Ayoade were wonderful surprises!

I loved hearing Tina Fey...but..she is struggling being not racist..wow

Otherwise-
I miss Jamie sounding like himself..but it was great to hear him do a dramatic performance!",kkbd5s
gh1pha9,"""I've been messing with this team for years!"" - That joke was the highlight of the movie for me.",kkbd5s
gh1pobg,"I thought it was mid-tier Pixar, which is still great of course, but it's not one of my favorites. But I'm so impressed with how subdued the soundtrack is for almost the entire movie. Some of the music during the ""spirit world"" scenes was hauntingly beautiful and the Earth scenes aren't filled with wacky, over the top tracks either. It's a lot of mellow ambience and city sounds instead, and it works so well to sell this movie's environments. I can't see younger kids getting that into it because it is fairly low on comedy for a Pixar movie and talks about some big concepts they wouldn't really understand, but this is aimed at an older audience first by including a middle aged guy going through issues a middle aged guy would face, which I really appreciate. But Pete Docter also did Up which had some similar themes, and I adore Up, so he definitely deserves more love.",kkbd5s
gh1pry0,Damn this movie felt short but it packed quite a bit into it. Pixar knows how to get you in the feels. Great casting on the voice actors.,kkbd5s
gh1pxr9,That was the most beautiful animation I’ve ever witnessed in my life. Can’t wait for what Pixar does next!,kkbd5s
gh1q95u,"First movie I've watched in a while where I didn't reach for my phone once. 

Just a beautiful movie.",kkbd5s
gh1qmr5,Really loved this movie. Felt like Pixar not caring about it being kids entertainment but just wanting to tella story. I also think this movie has the opposite message of Whiplash and La La Land. No spoilers for either film but their messages seem to be your passions give life meaning and are the highest goal. While this movie is trying to say life gives your passions meaning and living (or jazzing) is the highest goal. Loved this movie just for making me really think about life like this.,kkbd5s
gh1qv64,I still can’t believe Pixar decided to go Tree of Life at the end,kkbd5s
gh1r854,"Definitely the best Pixar movie since Ratatouille. I felt like I really related to the main character. I really need to find joy in the little things of life. I may work retail, not get along with my family, and feel like a failure, but there are other things i need to appreciate more.",kkbd5s
gh1rdgp,"The fast pacing of the movie makes this a perfect film to reflect on because so much ground is covered. The theme that the spark isn't the meaning or the purpose, it's just a source of inspiration is certainly a lot to chew on, but characters like the Dez who was able to find meaning in something he never intended on doing, or moments like when Curley off handedly mentions that Mr. Gardner was the only reason why he graduated high school while Joe thinks his life was meaningless really leaves a lot to contemplate.

This film I think ends up being a very good complement to Inside Out, both leaving you examining deeper feelings and meanings while still being fun and enjoyable movies.",kkbd5s
gh1rg1g,What a great film!,kkbd5s
gh1rk58,"It’s crazy how Pixar created a movie like this, during the pandemic we’re going through. I literally just finished watching the movie & at the end I had tears coming out of my eyes. This movie shows the audience to appreciate the small things in life. Don’t take “boring old everyday things” for granted. Who’s to say we’ll be here tomorrow. I feel like this movie captured the beauty in saying “hey everyone’s got a purpose in life, enjoy it & don’t take it for granted”. It’s been a rough year for most of us, but we’re almost at the end. Appreciate those little things in life & enjoy your purpose.",kkbd5s
gh1rn8z,I thought this movie was going to go the Inside Out / Coco route and I'm 100% glad it did not. This movie was surprisingly very creative with the real world and after life concept,kkbd5s
gh1rpt1,Great pic.  Love when new Pixar films come out.  It’s usually the only time my family can all really be pulled into a movie together and nobody on their phones.,kkbd5s
gh1s4wv,"Pixar always knocks it out of the park when it comes to their movies' storytelling and aesthetics but wow the lighting in this was absolutely breathtaking.

It truly felt like they were just flexing what they were capable of during some of the city shots. Can't imagine what they'll be showcasing in a few years' time",kkbd5s
gh1s8mr,"I’m in love with this movie. Just visually stunning, powerfully written, and incredibly optimistic. 

I can’t recommend this enough.",kkbd5s
gh1s9ur,I learned I should be enjoying pizza and soda more.,kkbd5s
gh1sbyq,Pretty pretty pretty good! I really enjoyed it as an accidental Christmas movie,kkbd5s
gh1t469,This was absolutely wonderful and I do not understand any of the detractors. It’s a lovely movie,kkbd5s
gh1t96q,"I teared up at the scene where he plays the piano with 22’s stuff. Love the message of this movie. I felt something wake up in me and now I really want to just live life. This movie along with Ratatouille, The Incredibles, Wall-e, and Monsters Inc are the best of Pixar. I wasn’t a huge fan of the freaky Friday thing but it grew on me very quickly and ended up being amazing. Also the lost souls are terrifying. Best joke was when the sign flipping dude implied he was doing drugs, and when that one dude on the escalator was asked why he wasn’t running and he was like “iunno”.",kkbd5s
gh1tesu,Joe having Haitian Fight Song by Charly Mingus as his ringtone was really cool.,kkbd5s
gh1teyx,"Why was John Ratzenberger not in this?

They could've easily made him one of the cosmic beings or 22's voice when they say ""I could sound like this"" when Joe asks why they sound like a middle aged white lady.",kkbd5s
gh1thb4,Can someone answer for me is this the type of Pixar movie that rips your emotional guts out and leaves you a snotty crying mess? Or is it more like a Incredibles/Cars movie thats touching but not overwhelming?,kkbd5s
gh1to70,Hits all the right spots. Best of 2020 that Ive seen so far.,kkbd5s
gh1tupc,I turned it on as something to have in the background but didn’t expect it to be so poignant. I laughed and cried several times. Probably one of my top favorite Pixar movies.,kkbd5s
gh1txe3,Moonwind blasting Subterranean Homesick Blues amongst the lost souls was a fun reference. Bob Dylan famously holds and throws cardboard signs in that music video.,kkbd5s
gh1uetf,The Marie Antoinette gag caught me way off guard.,kkbd5s
gh1un5l,"Best pixar film in a long time. I just loved how much time it took just to let scenes *breath* and not always hectically moving from one set piece to the next.

gh1vbf1,"Saw “2319” too, which is the security number from Monsters, Inc. (also a Pete Doctor film)",kkbd5s
gh1vmur,Just realized John Ratzenberger was nowhere to be found in this.,kkbd5s
gh1wp2l,"Really loved the movie. Its abstract nature does leave you somewhat detached from the characters, but man do its themes hit home. That sequence of Joe in his home reminiscing about all the small moments in life was a thing of beauty. I do wonder how much kids will love this one given that it tackles a lot of adult topics. Still has lots of laughs. 

Also very glad the Trailers didn't spoil the body swap.",kkbd5s
gh1xejf,Do you think that this is a kid's movie or more for adults? And why?,kkbd5s
gh1ylpd,"I can't believe they beat the Bing Bong scene, one of, if not, my favorite sacrifice scenes ever when Joe and Lemon jumped into earth. It just made me happy and teary. Inside out is for me the best Pixar movie, but this one can go head to head and I think even comes out on top now.",kkbd5s
gh1z3j6,I loved the movie and thought it looked amazing but I’ll be honest a lot of the main messages it was trying to convey went right over my head. Which is more me being an idiot rather then any fault of the movie so I still loved it,kkbd5s

gh21iq1,Anybody know who voiced the singer in the subway?,kkbd5s
gh21kp7,"Pulling from a comment I made as a rebuttal, but I wanted to make this as a top-level comment since I hadn’t seen it mentioned. 

I loved Inside Out, but movies like that or Up feel like they’re cheating when it comes to affecting me emotionally, relying on very heavily emotional topics when the standard Pixar cry moment comes up. While Soul still hits me deep while not necessarily relying on the emotional hammer of it all. I remember feeling cheated during some other movies, because my crying was more as a result of empathy or forced emotion, and very much so less of a result of my own feelings about the event. Soul gave me that emotional trigger, but there wasn’t a hammer. 

I’m excited to hear my therapists opinion on it since she’ll have a very direct example to point to when it comes to describing mindfulness in at least that one definition.",kkbd5s

Of course children can love this movie (and I hope so) but I feel this film is a high quality work more so for those grown ups still, young at heart.

And maybe by virtue of lacking the characters you can tie into a Happy Meal is what elevates it.",kkbd5s

gh23s85,I really enjoyed this movie. I wish there were more movies like this. Little kids might not get it though and some scenes may even scare them. They haven't had that existential crisis yet lol. It felt like therapy. Night and Day between this and WW1984 lol,kkbd5s
gh242j6,"The animation was beautiful, the plot/script was interesting but it was like an hybrid of Inside Out (Brain) + Onward (living your life) + Coco (afterlife), I hope that after this film they can move on to another phase or topic.

Also I felt like it was slightly short, it didn’t felt like a AAA Pixar Production, maybe because there wasn’t a big campaign behind? Or because the characters weren’t to marketable. 

Anyway, great movie, NYC is beautiful as ever and the music was too.",kkbd5s
gh2454k,"Seriously, thank god Pixar exists. A film of this size, on Disney Plus, being released on Christmas day - and it's this deeply profound and moving film that's in many ways about depression? Curious to see how younger audiences react to it, too.",kkbd5s
gh250i9,"Overall I really enjoyed the movie. The visuals, the music, the world, the concept, etc were all great and I’m really happy Pixar made arguably its most “grown up” film ever. With that said, I felt like some things were a bit unclear, particularly with the logic. The one thing that I was really confused by was Joe “entering the zone” at the end of the film to get back to the great before. I know he took 22’s earth badge for himself(?), but at that point the Jerry’s should have known Joe was alive and in my mind should have naturally been given the chance to go back to his body without any special circumstances or conversations. And if he was to choose to go into the great beyond, does that erase his night at the jazz club and the entire day from the moment he woke up from the coma? It also just seemed odd to me that humans could enter the great beyond by simply going into some kind of zone and create a lot of potential havoc. Over the centuries it seems like the Jerry’s/Terry would have noticed these human souls wandering around, it would throw off the count right? Maybe I’m looking too into it!",kkbd5s

Jon Batiste did a brilliant, inspirational job but the “outer world” music was a standout amongst a whole film of standouts.",kkbd5s
gh2akja,"Honestly only real complaint is it got kinda stagnet in the middle. Other than that really solid. For a movie about music and existential meaning it was written and scored really well. Love they went from jazz of a hustling and bustling New York to a Synth track for this purgatory and a mystic almost overwhelming sound for the escalator to the great beyond. It was funnier than it had any right to be. Great character design and just over all animation. As most people have said and I agree definetly a top 5 pixar film.

9/10",kkbd5s
gh2bfgd,"It's hands down one of the best Pixar movies for me.  From the animation and soundtrack, to the themes explored in the film, everything was just top notch.  I did have some minor nitpicks though:

1.  I find it hard to believe that Joe was the only one to escape going to the great beyond given how easy it seems to just go to the great before.  I'm also sure he isn't the only one who suffered an untimely death so why was he the only one who reacted that way?  The other souls just seemed to accept their fate.



2.  For someone who fell into a manhole he didn't seem to suffer any injuries.  No broken bones or even just minor scrapes or bruises.  He was also able to just walk out of the hospital in a gown with no one stopping him.",kkbd5s
gh2bqww,"Can anyone help me out... I watched this film and it really hit hard, but there was a scene where Joe was getting on the train in the subway and he heard a guy singing and busking and his voice was incredible. Anyone have any clue who voiced the busker??",kkbd5s

gh1oeu7,"I have to say, I absolutely loved this film. Everything about it was amazing and the visuals and animation.... probably the best that I have ever seen, period. Film flowed so beautifully and it surprised the shit out of me with what it was actually about, since I didn't watch trailers or anything like that. But...I wonder if it would be even better if Joe actually died in the end. Like, what if he just accepted his death with the final realisation of what life actually is about. I feel that would hit much stronger emotionally and it would be like ""hey, you can't actually cheat death and sometimes life sucks and you have to deal with it"". I understand this is Pixar after all and it would be too depressing, but I don't know. Him swapping his life for the life of 22 would honestly be super emotional. Nevertheless, 9/10 for me. Absolutely amazing.",kkbd5s
gh2avu3,"Damn, I agree with everything everyone’s been saying, one of the greatest Pixar films ever. 

One thing I’ve seen no one talk about is at the end, where Joe helps 22 find her place and then accepts going to the great beyond. He doesn’t fight or runs like the start of the film, no, he stands still and he smiles. A really beautiful moment showing he’s learned to appreciate life but not cling to it as much.

Then he’s offered a second chance and the movie ends showing Joe enjoying life for what it is - appreciating the little things and “living every moment”. I really love how we aren’t given a huge epilogue showing where 22 ended up or what Joe does with his life now because we don’t need to know. Instead the movie gives us this short expressing the lessons the characters have learnt and the messages of the film.

Overall great film that I would highly recommend, I can’t wait to watch it again.",kkbd5s

gh23d4d,"One of Pixar's best films!!

- Set a new standard for animation. Render of NYC, people and their physical attributes, musical instruments and the soul world is fantastic!
- Tina Fey was perfect as 22! Her montages with the previous mentors is my favourite part!
- Supporting cast were really good, especially Graham Norton as Woodwind! 
- Exploration of soul world and how being 'in the zone' is the bridge between the physical and spiritual world
- Exploration of philosophical themes resulting in me having an existential crisis
- Music was perfect! Some of the best Jazz music by Jon Batiste (he was in charge of NYC music)
- Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross just got right in with an animation film without missing a beat. They are in charge of the soul world music. Favourite music is when Joe is captured and falls into the soul world in the subway station.
- Ending could have been better but I understand why they end it that way. 
- Favourite joke: 22 being the reason for the Knicks' losing. Perfect set-up, delivery and execution!",kkbd5s

Such a beautiful movie. What I got from it is, you don't need to be the most talented person, or the smartest, or find something grand to find your identity or meaning to your life. That's not the point of it at all.

You just gotta stop chasing, and start living. Life is amazing. From the things that scare you, to the warmth you feel. From beautiful music, to just breathing in air. Nothing is a waste, as long as you know that you're alive, how beautiful and rare it is, to even exist.",kkbd5s

But I did love it, the message, and the whole artistic splendor of it all. 

Definitely one of the better Pixar movies but it's probably going to remain a deep cut because I don't think it's as iconic or approachable as a lot of their classics.

It took the Inside Out format and pushed it to 11.

It's probably the most constructive and helpful movies to come out of Pixar...less busy with flashy high concepts and more concerned about delivering a message in a clear and thorough way.

Will likely stay in the upper echelon of my Pixar movie favorites.

Wonderful film though. The thing I always appreciate about Pixar (and Pete Docter’s films in particular) is that their messages are so universal. It feels like they really want the world to be a better, more understood place if we all just listened and worked together. 

Super stoked for Docter leading Pixar if this is the direction and quality they can maintain.",kkbd5s

gh1rcwx,"Just got done watching this movie. Literally five minutes ago. At first, I was a little frustrated at how little I felt impacted by the movie, but it takes a little thinking and some filtering out to really appreciate it. I would recommend seeing it multiple times and maybe from a different perspective. Voice cast did a great job and the animation is stellar. The music is fantastic and I loved the New York culture they showed. My only problem is, I thought that the conflicts were resolved too easily and that the middle part with the body swap didn't always land with the humor.  But now that I think about it, it feels like the conflicts and humor and straight up plot were never really the point and that they were in there because this was an animated kids movie. Like it was trying to deliver a message, but because it was in the medium of a Disney movie, it needed these traditional elements. Though it doesn't do these elements the best, if you look at just the message and the scenes that contribute to this message, it's a real emotional rollercoaster. My absolute favorite part of this movie is Joe slowly discovering what a spark is. The whole time, he assumes that a spark is a straight up purpose, but this narrow view gets changed as he sees how much 22 just enjoys living once she tries it. The scenes with him reliving his memories of life and watching 22 learn how to live and especially the ending scene where he realizes that he may not exactly know what his purpose is, but he still intends to live his life loving every minute, are probably the film's best. They contribute to the overall message, which is that we are born to live and that while passion and purpose exist, it isn't why humans exist. This is the kind of movie that makes you cry not during its runtime, but in the minutes after it has ended. The pacing is kind of like jazz, because it feels improvised and weird. Some may not like it, but some may find the weird pacing fresh (like how Joe dies really early and gets back to his body well before the actual final conflict). With a theme and style so amazing, it's just that scenes where the movie has to shove in some sort of justification to keep the plot sane (like the one where Jerry gives Jerry another chance at life because he ""inspired"" them somehow) kinda stick out like a sore thumb. Also the Jerrys and the Terry were kind of lame in this movie. Their designs were cool and all and I like how they operate like a system (Jerrys being caretakers and Terry being the one who keeps data on all of life), but the movie brings in cool concepts like alternate dimensions of pure sound and pure energy and negative dimensions and then most of the movie is in the newborn center or New York. Also, Jerrys being all of these dimensions crashing into one was cool, but they were glorified helpers. And Terry existing as pure energy on Earth and transferring himself into different forms (sound, light, heat, electricity) to move around was awesome, but we barely see it. But then again, the movie was not made to explore dimensions that exist outside our own or to explain what lies in the Great Beyond. What explanations it does offer is vague, but satisfying enough. 8/10 this was a strange one.",kkbd5s

I see so many people saying 22 saying she's ""not good enough"" had them balling. Meanwhile I was sitting there waiting for the climax to happen, and then the credits rolled.

I genuinely cannot state in enough ways how much I see nothing that others are saying about this film. Those saying the score was incredible and unique and it flooring them have clearly never played an indie game in their lives. It was really cool, but that was it. It's an amalgamation of any Jim Guthrie game, *Fez*, *Thomas Was Alone*, and countless others.

Nothing of the environments seemed to flow or fit at all. Beyond the 'Zone' which isn't really explored at all and is actively broken when Joe just suddenly jumps out of it and back into the soul world (what, did he have a heart attack at his piano?), gone are incredibly intelligent things like the 'train of thought' from *Inside Out.* The... 'Hall of Everything'? What? The entire look of the soul world transitions was like someone saw *Space Odyssey* and the music video for  'Do I Wanna Know?' once. Like what is the whole psychedelic ship thing? I get that it's a creepy hippy thing, but... It was so out of place and unimaginative. Either go full abstract or do it cleverly.

Where was the story? Someone please tell me where you felt the ""hit like a truck"" of emotion. Seriously. The way everyone is talking about this film is beyond cringe-inducing. I saw someone on Google reviews say their boyfriend ""burst into tears after a physical, spiritual and therepeutic revelation"" at watching this film. I'm sitting here wondering why half of it was spent as a rip-off of that Kevin Spacey film where his consciousness is in the cat. Just felt so incredibly derivative it hurt.

What was the whole thread about Joe not talking to the Barber and realising he was selfish and only spoke about himself all the time? That went nowhere. It seems like this scene paired with Dorethea saying ""What arrogance, you really are a jazz musician"" really fucked the message and tone. Makes me not understand why people are saying the ""live life"" message had them ""crying for 20 minutes"".

And maybe it's because I'm a Brit, but I loathed 22. It's really hard to emotionally engage with a character whose only trait is that they have no self-worth, and they use this as an excuse to shit on everyone around them. When she ran off with Joe's body and then got sent back, while Joe got to go to the gig, I was happy. Yes, she nearly fucked up his life's dream. Good. But I guess if Americans empathsie with and love loud-mouthed Melissa McCarthy types, this film isn't aimed at me.

The pacing was a drag, 90% of scenes felt like they had no substance to them and where only there to lead to slightly less dull scenes that the writers thought would be impactful but didn't hit the mark, I felt the piano scene would have been far more impactful to me if I actually cares about this character at all but his entire characterisation is being obsessive and annoying so I really didn't resonate with him at all. I found the comedy just fell flat for me, I was trying to force laughs out of myself thinking it was just me being not in the mood but when watching it again with other people there was not a single laugh at the very forced scenes. I found the world building was dull as hell and none of it seemed to fall into eachother naturally like movies like inside out where the world feels practical. The animation personally made me uncomfortable, I have never watched a Pixar movie before and just didn't like the look of it but the shapes and expressions here, especially in the humans was just so off putting. The themes would have been interseting if they didn't keep muddling it up with the jagged rules and ideas they put in the world. The ending was obviously bad. If there was one word I had to use to describe this movie it would just be uncomfortable. A secondary word would be pretentious,it feels like the writers thought they could rely on very basic philosophical themes/ideas to carry the movie without focusing much on the plot, the pacing, the characterisation etc. I liked the premis but it was poorly executed, I loved every but if music that wasn't jazz (I have heard jazz in plenty of movies and shows but I have never heard it quite as jagged-ey, maybe it's because I don't resonate with that genre of music but I've definitely heard jazz that I like before and this just seemed again uncomfortable), I am not a hater of new Pixar ideas, I loved there other latest movie onward, there where certainly big flaws but it had a lovley charm to it and far better executed themes, characters, premis, narrative, symbolism etc. I feel like there was some interesting things going on here but they were always held back by the fact it's a kid's movie and oh gosh we have to make it easily digestible for the kids, but as I write this out I realise that movies like inside out deal with intense and philosophical ideas in far more natural and compelling ways, all Pixar movies do, so why is one that is concentrated on that motif feel so unpolished, well like I said because they focused on that aspect thinking it would carry them not realising that it is an accompanying tool used to enhance the themes and characters.",kkbd5s

User Review  **Declined** (1)

### USER REVIEWADDITION

Seeing the plethora of 10/10 ratings is deplorable above anything I've ever seen in fake movie reviews. I sat and watched this entire movie with my grandparent aged parents, myself, and my son. At no point were any of us blown away at what was on screen, and the movie never distanced itself from standard content you might see on a television animation episode.  


The standards Pixar has set for itself are almost peerlessly high. Treasures like Toy Story still have me quoting and reminiscing anytime I see a Pixar logo. It's hard to see a Cowboy and not want to scream out, ""There's a Snake in My Boot"" or ""Someone's Poisoned the Waterhole!"". Soul didn't have one memorable quote or scene in the entire runtime that I will ever look back on years later in blissful glee.  


Coming off of Inside out, and the lesser but still fun Onward, Soul feels like a watered down, color by numbers, generic animated movie. For anyone to say otherwise is either lying, or has yet to experience a variety of movies to compare this against.  


The first half hour is almost glacially slow and void of dimension. When the action starts to pick up, it never quite elevates itself above typical tropes and wishful thinking pandering you might see in a hallmark movie.  


The animation is fairly basic, and doesn't ever showoff the skill and prowess Pixar had set as the industry standard. If this movie was coming from a lesser studio, it would be another average movie that couldn't gain traction.  


I love Pixar, and even stayed in the Cars hotel in Disney at the Art of Animation resort. Even with their weaker efforts in the past, they managed to put together a compelling and engaging movie with rewatchability. I would never willingly choose to watch Soul again over any other option out there today.  


How anyone could come out of this giddy, bouncing quotes and smiles around the room is beyond reason. While I appreciate resources like IMDB, this just goes to show that you can't judge a movie by the score it receives anymore.

gh69c32,Pretty racist movie.,kkbd5s
gh7enzg,"There is an absence of discussion on this forum regarding the mistaken identity alleyway scene where Terry mistakes Joe's identity for another black man.

I found this scene to be out of place. If it was intended to shed light on violent social injustice, it was incomplete. If it was comedic, it was dark and disturbing.

Three images lead me to believe it was the latter: Terry's violent finger pointing, Terry's condescending consoling with chips, and the pedestrians that passby a clearly traumatized Paul.

All in all, I loved this movie, but I do believe it warrants a rating commensurate with its mature subject matter.",kkbd5s
gh502fz,"Something about this movie felt off. You’re telling me that a man that was inspired to dedicate his life to jazz because of his deceased father **did not look for his father when he was in the afterlife?** No mention whatsoever. And then at the end when he’s offered to go back to earth, he doesn’t even think about his dad at all?

Also, what the hell was up with the portrayal of teachers? The week after next I will be student teaching. I feel so shitty about teaching now, as if there’s some greater purpose in life that I’m missing out on.

The movie just rubbed me the wrong way. It talks about how great and wonderful the little things are in life, yet ignore all of the horrible things that you must endure. What happens if 22 is born somewhere without basic human rights? Abused, or tortured? At least 22 likes looking at leaves I guess",kkbd5s

He literally dies, because he fails to take in the world in its entirety, because he's so absorbed by his one thing, believing that only this one single thing will make him happy. And then he realizes the simple beauties of life, because those simple beauties just seemed to utterly mesmerize 22, someone who has never experienced life. As such they're already small wonders compared to an existence without feeling, taste, or smell.

The only ""issue"" is maybe that his focus is something rather positive, being a passionate and talented musician. It's a bit difficult to say ""hey don't JUST focus on music"", given how there's so many vices etc. They could have put a bit more emphasis on someone with a nice passion devolving into a shadow thing instead of just doing the stockmarket gag.",kkbd5s

My 9 year old (very social and charming/outgoing, loves to make people laugh) LOVED it, as soon as it was over he wanted to remember all the funny parts (when one baby soul pushed another baby soul over, etc). My 6 year old (who is a notably old soul, very smart and sensitive for his age) sniffled a few times during it, when it was over said it was “lame” and went running to his room crying. We had to sit and have a chat about why he was upset (the movie was too sad) and I explained that sometimes it’s good to watch sad things because that makes the happy things so much better! We talked all about the movie and the different things that resonated with him (death, what happens after death, how to live life to the fullest) and by the time we were done he was laughing and happy and said he really loved the movie he just didn’t realize there were going to be sad parts. I ran here after the movie was over because I was so touched and wanted to share how wonderful of a movie it was. Everyone needs to watch it!",kkbd5s

gh5msxb,"This was exactly my takeaway. It felt like from the themes to the references that the movie was made much make for adults than kids. Which is fine, since the message is probably needed by more adults. But I don’t see kids being able to latch onto this the way they could Inside Out, which dealt with equally complex themes. I don’t know that it would’ve done great at the box office, and I would be worried that Hollywood would have learned the wrong lesson from that.",kkbd5s

I love watching how engrossed they become as the movie starts and makes its way through all the fabulous & entertaining scenes. Given their ages, I definitely don’t think either of them “get” any of the themes but I wouldn’t expect them to. I’m just glad to expose them both to a thought-provoking, musical, stimulating, and diverse Disney film.",kkbd5s

That part really hit me in the feels.  Just having a mentor or just someone there to support your passions especially an adult when you are a kid goes a long way.  I remembering as a kid abandoning so many hobbies and passions because I had nobody in my life that supported or encouraged these things.

gh4jux5,"Absolutely agreed. I know a few of the musicians that played on this, Marcus Gilmore and Linda May Han Oh (drums and bass respectively), and I can tell you that’s their playing on there. I’m also a musician myself and while of course, it is simplified for theatre, is an actual representation of jazz and jazz musicians which was a huge discussion in relationship to Whiplash.

The whole getting sounded for a gig thing is accurate, where someone will tell you “come play”. As a musician you’re told that any time you play is an audition and while this was labeled more obviously as one, this situation really does happen. The whole “looking like a million bucks” thing is so true. 

I also know so many musicians like Joe, who only live to make music and have no other interests or passions. There’s many people I know that I honestly think that need to watch this movie.",kkbd5s

gh82tj0,"It's not just the colours and textures, it was the photography. In Toy Story 4, they modelled actual cameras and lenses to bring an extra layer of realism to things, and it seems like they really steered into that with this film. At least with the scenes on Earth, it never felt like they'd used crazy camera moves or put the camera in places you couldn't in real life. So much of this film felt like it was a live action film, not because it looked realistic, but because it felt realistic. Really loved everything about that.",kkbd5s

Content that she was finding the good in that moment. It was the fact that I was there with her then that gave her her spark. Her family. She didn't care about hers or mines purpose in life, all that matter was the moments that she lived.",kkbd5s

gh1t1t8,yeah this hit me deep inside my soul. my daughter and i were in tears.,kkbd5s

I doubted myself for a sec and thought maybe it was another team... and then I saw the ""Knicks fans only"" sign in the barber shop and it's set in NYC, and I just now rewinded to the scene and I just realized I shouted so loud I covered the voiceover ""the Knicks lose another one"" (also I'm dissapointed Pixar couldn't get the great walt frazier to voice that line, I mean you guys got lewis hamilton to cameo in cars 2!! But maybe if it weren't for covid they could have flown walt to the studio to record his cameo). There was another Knicks sign in the movie does anyone else remember where?

But man I miss theatres because that's the only time the whole movie I made a sound (vs my sister who was spouting all her theories and predictions during the movie but I didn't want to tell her to shut up😅) and I bet if I was watching this in a theater in nyc the whole theatre would have been doing the same laughing their asses off screaming ITS THE KNICKS and nobody would have heard that voiceover anyways.",kkbd5s

gh1v9dx,"Yes! And what I loved about it in particular was the reframing of the diner scene. When Joe was with 22, it was a sign of a lonely,sad life. When seen again at the end, it was all about being in the simple moment of enjoying a damn fine piece of pie. Loved it.",kkbd5s
gh233ey,"The portrayal of the lost souls as your obsessions really hit me hard. As someone who's struggled with OCD, panic disorders, and a history of Sexual abuse i nearly fucking lost it when Joe was going inside 22s demons.

gh3ff7x,"I’m a musician, and a piano player. And I’ll often have times where I’m working through some emotion or problem, and I’ll just sit down to play. Just making something up that sounds like what I’m feeling. Usually it’s late at night and I’ll have headphones on so as not to bother neighbors. I don’t record it, so it’s just a really intense bit of music and emotion that only I hear, and because I’m making it up no one will ever hear it again. 

That scene is the single most accurate depiction of those moments of my life I’ve ever seen. The music he plays is even similar to the kind of music I play. I’m not a Black man or even that much of a jazz musician, but for that one scene it really was like watching myself.

I’ve generally been a happy, go with the flow kinda person, but its always frustrated me a bit that I’m “successful” but have never really found my passion (or maybe more so, I’ve avoided my professional “passions” to just have a stable life.)

Everyone always told me I should find a career I’m passionate about because it’ll be what I spend most of my life doing, but really, I just want a stable income and a good work life balance so that I have enough time and money to do the things that really bring me happiness (traveling, experiencing new cultures, sports, video games, other forms of entertainment, etc.)

gh1xi5p,I like my cape movies but no.way are they even in the se ballpark as Pixar originals,kkbd5s
gh28bsv,I saw both.  I thought Soul was way better than WW84.,kkbd5s
gh20w1t,I watched WW84 and immediately followed it up with Soul because I knew Pixar wouldn’t let me down like DC constantly has.,kkbd5s
gh1wqt8,I would’ve loved to see that Knicks joke with an audience. Damn that was hilarious.,kkbd5s
gh8m4c6,They aren’t even in the same ballpark.  Soul is easily the better of the two.,kkbd5s
gh4n1ec,We can STILL see it when things go back to normal. I myself am glad I was able to watch at home because I cried like a baby for a half hour,kkbd5s
ghg3s7i,Why not haha - Pixar movies are always visually stunning,kkbd5s
gh1jupo,Yup I came here to say this same thing. I absolutely loved how they focused on the small everyday things we don’t take notice of.,kkbd5s
gh2u0f7,"For a soul that didn't believe life wasn't worth living on Earth and having been mentored by many great souls, it took an ordinary man like Joe to convince 22 that life on Earth is WORTH living.  And this moment showed it so well and just powerful.",kkbd5s
gh1wtq3,My elementary school playground had trees that would shed those little “helicopter seeds” we called them.  We’d gather them in handfuls and throw them into the sky.  Sometimes we’d do it all together and stand under our own shower of spinning seeds.,kkbd5s
gh1pq79,That scene really hit me hard.  Its been a super long time since Ive been in a space where I can just enjoy my surroundings.,kkbd5s
gh1vva0,That reminded me of my acid trips. It was beautiful.,kkbd5s
gh287b7,"It is an appreciation for the small and seemingly insignificant things in life - a way of making meaning from living.

I liked how they contrasted Joe from the big names of history.  The latter failed 22 - the lowly, insignificant former managed to get to her in her time of need, though he had to do some soul-searching himself.",kkbd5s
gh1s1sm,Reminded me of American Beauty.,kkbd5s
gh1x7ij,I teared up when Joe let go of 22s hand. I still get goosebumps. Amazing movie.,kkbd5s
gh2kvgg,"Yeah! I actually remember having a kinda similar experience in my early teens, just suddenly being overwhelmed by the beauty and texture of the world and ordinary life. I was just walking to the bus stop after a completely normal day at school and it hit me, I had to stop for a few minutes and really take it all in. The movie captured that feeling really well.",kkbd5s
gh1pmyz,I love doing this!,kkbd5s
gh1yymp,The audio mix did a big part there. Good job all around!,kkbd5s
gh2ms4x,"this scene gave me a flashback of my life pre-covid in the city where I have done similar things. during that time, I ran away from california to new york for a new life. though it was difficult time for me and i had no idea where I was heading in life, i really have lived. the city build me up from the bottom and it was the greatest supporter that I have ever had in my life. 

during this jarring time we live in now and that I have forced to move back to the place where i didn't belong because of COVID. I can't wait to get back to the city to live the life I was meant to have, not just career wise but to be happy and to live every single minute.

this was an amazing movie. have an amazing new year guys :)",kkbd5s
ghcxv2j,"Thought it was cool that the leaf was actually a seed, which is essentially what 22 was.",kkbd5s
gh2ry10,"God, that scene hurt me. In the best way possible.",kkbd5s
gpmv7tw,This was my favorite part as well. It’s a little unfortunate the rest doesn’t live up to the hype,kkbd5s
gh1yv37,That fucking saxophone looked more real than the one I have right next to me,kkbd5s
gh2ec2t,The blend of cartoon-style physiques for the characters and near-photorealism makes this movie probably the best animation I've ever seen. Pixar manages to blow me away every single time.,kkbd5s
gh2i0qs,"I saw right infront on my tv in awe - the detail! There’s that street scene where they’re walking down towards where 22 lays on the vent thingy (sorry I have no words lol). But you can see so much detail has gone into creating the world - the signs on the buildings, the buildings themselves were all characters - I think that’s part of the message too - really noticing the finer details of things",kkbd5s
gh50ujv,"The lighting in both the city animations and the great beyond moments was incredible...and I'll even say, as someone with an OLED TV I felt like I didn't really miss theatres in those beautiful black moments.",kkbd5s
gjsvuav,"It's called ACES. It's a piece of lighting rendering technology that was recently developed (used on the Lego movies, toy story 4) that accurately depicts light like the human eye perceives it.",kkbd5s
gi1p9nt,This video essay might be worth your while: https://youtu.be/AcZ2OY5-TeM,kkbd5s
ghn91hz,Sometimes I wonder if Pixar is TRYING to show off lol. This was honestly the most beautiful 3d animated film I've ever seen. Every material was spot on.,kkbd5s
ghsx3d7,"I noticed this in Toy Story 4, which I watched recently. The carnival ride scene was just jaw-droppingly beautiful. The lighting and textures Pixar is doing are just incredible. Joe’s sweater, the Jazz player’s hair and sequined dress, the overhead shot of New York. I couldn’t get over it.",kkbd5s
gh82bst,just watched it. they did it again.,kkbd5s
ghb4zvq,"Part of me wishes it was in the same “world” as Inside Out. I loved the character design of all the emotions, and it would’ve been fun to have a movie that was connected.

I also thought the world of Inside Out was a lot more beautifully animated and fully realized. I really did not like Soul’s animation with the white lines on top of transparent objects (like the scene in 22’s box). It came off as tacky and not fully realized.",kkbd5s
gh1o9kx,"I KNEW IT SOUNDED FAMILIAR. 

what a cast !!",kkbd5s
gh24u0p,"When they cut to him furiously spinning his sign, I died",kkbd5s
gh1zrqt,"I'm so glad they went with Graham Norton, way too many tv host or british accent roles have been going to James Corden for some reason and i can't stand that guy!

Edit: spelling",kkbd5s
gh4vmmf,"Maybe it's because I grew up near Eugene, and just over the hill from Ken Kesey's home, but I absolutely loved their tie dye ship, musical choices and and Moonwind Dreamstar names.",kkbd5s
gh2rx6v,I was watching it thinking “Is that...no...it can’t be Father Noel Furlong‽” And it was!,kkbd5s
gh4m95w,Anyone else feel like they modeled Moonwind after Thoros of Myr? I can’t be alone!,kkbd5s
gh99yp2,He's definitely gotta be a tribute to Alan Watts!,kkbd5s
ghs6kch,Graham Norton lived in a hippy commune when he was younger so it’s pretty fitting,kkbd5s
ghl4ajj,I’d like to see him interview himself in character on his show.,kkbd5s
gh28dws,Ohhh I had my money on Eddie Izard,kkbd5s
gh57up1,He was perfect for it but I kept expecting Stanley from Midnight Gospel to show up.,kkbd5s
gh90i37,It sounded like a Robin Williams impression,kkbd5s
gnjukh0,"Richard Ayoade was also brilliant.

He deserves more voice-over work.",kkbd5s
gh3xhda,"Honestly it also felt off to me that this one gig was treated like his one and only chance at a  “standard rich and famous contract” rather than just a right now opportunity, glad they sort of called that out with the “same thing tomorrow night” convo after.",kkbd5s
gh451lt,[deleted],kkbd5s
gh27cj3,They said it in Incredibles 2,kkbd5s
gh3ngb9,Quiet Coyote!,kkbd5s
ghq2mcg,"In my conservative family, and in the simpsons, you could say hell if you were talking about about hell.

Using it as a swear is different like ""what the hell""",kkbd5s
gh9ic3k,"They say ""ass"" in their pearl short. Honestly I don't think Disney is being too controlling at the moment in this regard. Seems like Pixar has a lot of creative freedom.",kkbd5s
ghrbeg6,In their short Purl they say ass I think,kkbd5s
gh3iun5,It did have a small thing at the end,kkbd5s
ghd5ea9,I just kept the credits on to vibe with the music,kkbd5s
gh4xvho,"I was hoping it would be a little scene of years in the future, an old Joe would run into a young and hopeful 22. They wouldn’t know it’s each other, but they would feel that connection you know?",kkbd5s
gh56rpg,"Yes, but now I remember that everything on Disney+ has slightly padded end credits due to international translation credits.",kkbd5s
gh1myqn,"My wife and I just hugged and cried. And agreed that, it's all just so beautiful, even if you can't see it at the moment. On a second watch there's a lonely moment in his gallery scene of him sitting alone eating pie, seems very sad; but during the remembering scene at the piano we see how much he enjoyed that bite of pie. Beautiful.",kkbd5s
gh1kea0,"That scene where Joe lays out the items is probably my scene of the year. The music, the imagery, the message... it’s all just perfect.",kkbd5s
gh1l1qh,That scene felt like therapy to me.,kkbd5s
gh1l1gv,"That scene reminded me a lot of what I loved about the movie Boyhood. I love the celebration of all of life's little ""insignificant"" moments. It really is beautiful.",kkbd5s
gh1m4gz,I loved that moment even more when you remember the scene earlier in the movie with the memory museum. It was a lot of the same moments presented without feeling or context. But he remembers them for himself it has so much power.,kkbd5s
gh1qdoc,Yep. Using those items as his “sheet music” was incredibly powerful.,kkbd5s
gh1lyd7,That scene was absolutely breathtaking. All the emotions just came at once and it was wonderful,kkbd5s
gh1nkh5,"I thought that scene was incredibly important to his arc, too - it was him reliving the memories that 22 had created as him that made him realize the true purpose of life is to live",kkbd5s
gh1rl4s,"For anyone into general Eastern philosophy, I found it to be such a deep scene on the importance of living in the present moment, appreciating every bit of the world around us with every breath we take, and not getting too caught up in the whole rat race of life that we tend to find ourselves caught up in. 

Live every moment here and now, never dwell over what the past could or should have been or what fears/anxieties/stresses tomorrow may bring. Such a beautiful movie with so much thought and care put into the messages behind it.",kkbd5s
gh1ne2y,Yeah this scene and the score just absolutely floored me. I really loved this movie and maybe I just related to it more but this definitely one of my favorites maybe even my favorite Pixar movie. Phew,kkbd5s
gh6zwyh,And the barber scene really set up the premise of the message perfectly as well. He's not doing what he originally wanted but his life changed and he found joy in something else.,kkbd5s
gh1ojfa,"I’ve been listening to the song New Years Day by Taylor Swift…

“I want your midnights/But I’ll be picking up bottles with you on New Years Day.”

The big exciting moments are great, but it’s the prosaic days with loved ones that matter the most.",kkbd5s
gh82brm,All things I took granted like watching movies in theatres or buying a hotdog on the street. Corona really made me realize that.,kkbd5s
ghw1y63,"He removed the sheet music, which is something that tells you what to play, and replaces it with experiences. He plays his memories, his emotions. This is a perfect depiction of self expression.",kkbd5s
gh1rrj8,Damn that hit me so hard for some reason and when I Welled up a bit I noticed the character did too,kkbd5s
gh2ab7y,Really looking forward to whatever Kemp Powers does next.,kkbd5s
gh5erd0,That scene is going to be put next to that scene from Ratatouille (you know the one) on how to make a great scene by showing and not telling,kkbd5s
gh7e1gu,Yo wtf is your comment making me cry?,kkbd5s
ghe45qd,Couple days late replying to this but I had a similar thing happen recently when my wife got me an album of all the things we've done with the kids over the past few years. I was feeling down and guilty that we hadn't done a lot but I forgot about so much of it and was like wow we've had a lot of fun.,kkbd5s
gh1r6g3,"So in this scene... does he die? He goes “into the zone” but jumps on Grahm’s hippie ship. Then follows 22. 

Later when he’s done talking to to Jerry he’s on the way to afterlife. Jerry says he can have a second shot... so did he die again? When the gig didn’t hit him the way he thought it would did he kill himself? Or did he just die because of the earlier fall? Or do these Christmas tree edibles got me trippin",kkbd5s
gh1jjwm,"My brother said ""That sounds really bad."" It was pretty jarring until you realize it's a middle school class.",kkbd5s

ghcychu,"This might be dumb as fuck but did 22 become Connie, the student from Joe’s class? She kinda looked Asian/Tibetan, and time doesn’t exist up there so the timeline doesn’t matter.

gh216av,"I loved the message in the barbershop scene too. Even if you don’t end up where your passion intended, you can still find happiness and fulfillment somewhere else. I really needed to hear that in my 20’s when my original life goals didn’t go as planned",kkbd5s
gh2e1ad,I loved the barbershop scene. It kind of showed Joe that his focus on music kept him from getting closer to others. He never knew the barber until 22 gave the barber space to talk about something else.,kkbd5s
gh1vc6p,"The biggest problem with the movie is it was targeted at black Americans to be a powerful story of trying to be successful in America but instead it paints a story that tells black Americans that they should just be happy to be alive and thats  ""good enough"" and to just accept it. Very ""work will set you free"" kinda nazi shit. This is even more obvious when you consider all the extra dimensional beings in charge are white people with white voices. This movie is problematic.",kkbd5s
gh3w7hr,"This was actually a big artistic breakthrough Andrew Stanton wanted to use for Wall-E, and he talks in some special features about how they were one of the first on that movie to deliberately make the camera animate as if it were a real camera and not a computer scene camera. I think now they even use motion capture to animate the cameras as if a real camera operator were holding it in a 3D scene.",kkbd5s
gh4arh0,"Yeah, it's been around for a long time. Very prominent in Wall-E and some of Pixar's newer stuff but there are shots going back to Monsters inc that simulate that hand-held feel.",kkbd5s

Nine lives, man. Nine lives.",kkbd5s
gh1qiqa,"Regarding the cat: Maybe one of the Jerrys were able to intercept it while it was on the escalator. Or it's just a visual gag which we mustn't overthink. 

Really liked the ending. I'm glad that they didn't go with the cliché of showing 22 becoming a newborn and getting physical form.",kkbd5s
gh5gdfv,Scrolled down way too far to find a comment about the cat.  That was seriously bugging me lol,kkbd5s
ghsnx15,"The ending HAD to be abrupt and I'm so glad they made it like that. I think if they fleshed it out anymore it may have taken away from how poweful the last 20-30 minutes are. I think it actaully added something more to it in a way. 

I haven't seen such a stirring ending to a film in some time now. I felt like a train hit me after coco, but I was even more blown over by this film and it's ending.",kkbd5s
gh28i7n,Indeed!  It leaves Joe and 22 with possibilities - untouched and unseen by the audience.,kkbd5s
gh3olua,I thought for sure the joke would be Joe went into the cat’s body because cats have no soul,kkbd5s
gh2kswh,Agreed i thought the ending was perfect. Dont get the hate personally.,kkbd5s
gh9bv8j,"There’s a lot we don’t know about Joe. They didn’t go into who “Lisa” was, a lot of his life we see with 22 (why the Binaca was so important, etc.) don’t get answered. Kind of liked that they hinted at a whole life we didn’t get to see",kkbd5s
gh2402l,Most cats have no souls.  We saw that in Inside Out.,kkbd5s

gh254pz,wouldn't have thought synths/electronics being so prominent in the score of a jazz movie would work but gd it really did,kkbd5s
gh23drx,Trent and Atticus just create sounds that skip my ears and go directly into my soul. I can’t say I love every track the ever made but when watching the movie their score just enhances everything so well,kkbd5s

Beyond excited to follow Reznor’s career in scoring for years to come.",kkbd5s
gh5ofh1,Epiphany is my favorite so far. Just a piano telling a story.,kkbd5s
gh7gqv2,"The first thing I did was look up the music, and it was very helpful in picking where Batiste is and where Reznor is. But seeing those two names next to each other was super jarring at first. Plus, Reznor having a change from unnerving in *Social Network* to this is so sweet",kkbd5s

gh1o2f1,Just watched it with my kids. They didn't like it. They love all things Pixar. I think this one was just too heavy. Adults will love it though.,kkbd5s
gh1q4in,"I think this will be one of those movies that they'll understand as a kid, but it won't truly resonate until they're older.",kkbd5s
gh1ll2i,"Most of the movie features a talking cat and what is essentially a child living in a man's body. Kids will love it.

Edit: Okay maybe not literally every single kid in the world",kkbd5s

gh1w9gk,I thought the same but tbh I just let it go.,kkbd5s
gh2hl2p,And made a very realistic comment about struggling to get a cab... hospital gown notwithstanding.,kkbd5s

gh62ikt,When he was playing the show I thought he would go into the zone and 22 would try fuck him up or something lol,kkbd5s
gh393z5,The movie should’ve been more of this! Those scenes where he gets lost in the music were magical.,kkbd5s
gh9nfdy,"I think it's a great point about managing expectations about life. 

People have the capacity to really build things up in our minds, and when we actually achieve whatever we build up, it isn't as amazing as we thought in our heads. The best way to avoid this is to live in the moment, which is the message of the film. Don't wait for one thing, enjoy everything, enjoy the world around you all the time. Sure, some moments are greater than others, but life itself is pretty magical.",kkbd5s

Thanks a lot, buddy",kkbd5s
gjk8clo,Ur quote on the story was not complete but I got the exact same conviction.

gh26res,"This comment hit hard. I've been going through the exact same thing.

Seeing him finish his first gig and not feel as good as he thought was an incredible moment for me. One of my new goals is buying a house and it has borderline become an obsession and a 'cure' to my feelings of inadequacy and being behind in life.

I have been focused solely on the goal of getting a mortgage and genuinely believing at that point I'll be immediately happy and that all my problems will be solved. But that's not what happened in Soul. And that's not what will happen when I finally buy a flat. There will be a happy moment, yes, but then very quickly the rest of life will seep through and I will realise that the destination isn't all it's cracked up to be. And if I don't change something, I will forever be chasing a dream which will ultimately never manifest in full. 

It's made me realise that external factors and physical *things* are never going to make me truly happy, you need more than that. Sure, buying a house is a great goal to have and I won't let go of that, but it shouldn't be the defining feature of my success and the measure of my worth. My ultimate goal should not necessarily be to enjoy every day, but instead to try to enjoy the little moments that make life so wonderful. It's made me realise that I have to do so much more than just find worth through the value of my job or my eventual property. I have to find value in myself and the little moments of joy that I forget to relish in every single day.

The amazing thing is, I am finding myself appreciating the little victories and the simple things in life a lot more today. I haven't lost my passion to go out and push myself forward, but Soul reminded me just to do it a little slower, and enjoy the magical ride we call life.",kkbd5s

This said, most of reddit is populated by white people, nobody should expect proper discussion on that matter here. There's a whole lot to say.

Joe might be good at mentoring, but to showcase it as his ""true calling"" or whatever would go against what the movie tries to explain.

gh1nsax,"I wholeheartedly agree with all your points. I’m shocked by how many people are saying “he should’ve stayed dead!!” as if that was a requirement for the film. I loved how he got a second chance to appreciate life, not just his “spark”.

One thing I didnt particularly like was how they treated a soul on the brink of death, who comes back to life, as “cheating”. It implies that if you’re in critical condition in the hospital, you *must* die according to their rules. He only gets his second chance because he inspired Jerry who in turn tricked Terry. I would’ve liked if they gave him a second chance because of his will to be alive again. Implying that fighting/hanging on to life when you’re not ready to die is possible and happens from time to time.

But one thing I did love is the overarching theme. When I first saw the trailers, I thought it was going to be a “ditch your dull life and do what you love to REALLY be alive!”. It surprised me with having the exact opposite message: your life is not about a singular passion, career, or purpose. Rather, it’s about enjoying living and all the little things that make it worthwhile.",kkbd5s

The movie gives us a “second chance” in a way, by sending us the message to live our lives and enjoy all the little things that come with, cherish every second of it.

I have to disagree here, part of the big revelation at the end was life doesn't have a singular meaningful purpose. Thats what the movie i feel was trying to convey to us.

It’s perfectly in line with the theme of the film and doesn’t TELL us what he’s going to do.

gi1bdex,"> 1.	Joe should have stayed dead: This one doesn’t make any sense for two reasons. One, that’s super dark for what is essentially still a kids movie. Two, joe finding inner peace isn’t the point of the movie — it’s a byproduct. The central theme of Soul is finding purpose not in singular passions, but in simply experiencing the world around yourself and living. Joe returning back to earth at the end makes that point, with what the movie framed as the the limitless human potential for experience. In my opinion, that is a much more poignant and beautiful ending — not to mention thematically consistent. Joe staying dead would have felt out of place in a movie all about the beauty of life.

I feel like the ""Joe should have stayed dead"" take is based on how the audience sort of frames what happened in his life. 

Like you, I still disagree with that take based on how the movie prevents it, but it would be thematically consistent with this idea that he came to realize that he *did* live a good life—even if he was too focused on his goal to notice life going on around him. If we are to assume that realizing this at the end of it all is a positive outcome, then him staying dead would be fitting (""I achieved my purpose, even if I didn't know what it was at the time"")

But the movie paints Joe's perspective as having *not* lived due to being too obsessed with his goal, and so denying him the ability to really pursue that realization would be too cruel and not fit well with the sort of story the film wanted to tell.",kkbd5s

gh21c0a,"Absolutely disagree about teaching. It was an amazing set up at the beginning of the film that he had no real talent or passion for teaching. He doesn’t take any student aside to mentor them, or spark any creative drive specifically in a student. It’s all just a day job so he can pursue performing. It would have been cliche if that was the case.     
As a musician myself, I got into teaching because of the financial gain... but I quickly became passionate about it. However... Joe did not have that passion at all! The hallway scene was the most telling. He barely cares that his prized and talented pupil wants to quit. He doesn’t do anything to demonstrate his unique mentoring status. He kinda sucks as a mentor. In fact that’s in the text since his avatar was the most devastating to 22 in the lost soul scene.    
No him being alive and a musician at the end was the right choice for the text of the film. And it made Soul less of It’s a Wonderful Life, and more.... well.... Soul",kkbd5s

gh2vfr0,"Just to comment on your point about marriage and kids, I'm going to tell you a story about a colleague my mother had many years ago.

She remained single, unhappily, for years but she had a best friend who was also unattached so she had someone  to commiserate with about her situation. But then her best friend met someone in her fifties, moved in with him and eventually got married and this poor lady was unable to deal with it. So unable to deal with it that she felt completely unmoored from society and ended up having a nervous breakdown, locking herself in her house for weeks and eventually had to be institutionalized by her family. She never recovered. 

Now my mother told me this story as a random recollection YEARS ago when I was maybe 10 or 11 but it literally changed my life. I was so shocked that someone could be so unhappy that they didn't get attached to another human being or produce more human beings that she could literally *lose her mind*. I vowed that I would never live my life like that. Maybe you'll get married and maybe you won't, maybe you'll have kids and maybe you won't but if you don't, it doesn't mean that your life was meaningless or that you don't have something to offer the world. If those are things you want, great, but please don't allow yourself to be consumed by those desires or wait for marriage or procreation for your life to ""begin.""

gqwf1rg,">HOWEVER, I think it's criminal that they didn't let Joe die in the end.

Agreed.  It doesn't even make sense that Jerry was inspired by Joe.  Like the only thing Joe did was give back life to a baby he stole it from after he realized it felt empty.  Great, so he wasn't a total scummy sleezebag?  Thousands die every year protecting kids, and Jerry suddenly thinks this is some EXTRA inspiring?  The movie has so many weird inconsistencies like this just to make the audience laugh or feel good, even at the expense of it's own world building.

Edit: put another way, I'm definitely in the ""Joe was the antagonist of this film"" camp.  He blatantly ignores kind warnings from others, disregarding his safety.  He deceives others to get his way, he's impatient (like jumping into the body before Dreamwalker Windcatcher told him to), he gives the least amount of energy and time to 22's goals as possible up to the very end, he gives no shits to Connie his talented student of X years going through a crisis, he constantly tries to distract 22 from achieving it's own realization about life, and literally steals life from a baby who is on the verge of wanting to live.  He's also a total jerk to his barber (""This guy was born to cut hair"") and projecting his desires on others (such as always talking about jazz).  At the end, he is slightly redeemed by realizing he's been a terrible person throughout the entire film, but only slightly.  And the film undermines this process by treating him like some glorified saint.  

We don't really even see if his behavioral processes change.  If anything, I wouldn't be surprised if he left the film even more self-absorbed, because now he wants to ""live every moment"", so I guess he'll just go around doing whatever the heck he wants.",kkbd5s
gt0stkt,"Yep. That was the only thing I didn't like about the movie. I don't think it was a bad writing choice or anything just that I was ready to get emotionally wrecked by that scene and then the movie went ""Psyche! You actually thought we were going go through with it, what are we?HBO?"".

Regarding the more primordial, ""before-life"", I liked its whimsical approach to doling out traits and sparks. Just imagining that part done in a more serious, consecrated way gives me anxiety. The metaphor of cosmic forces acting as kindergarten teachers to prepare one's time for here fits nicely with my beliefs, and probably with the theme of the movie, where the real magic is implied to be living on Earth itself. Maybe a philosophical preference more than anything though.",kkbd5s
gjb8wl9,"Coco did that better, but this would have just been Coco if they did that. 

If they fleshed out the spirit world it would have just been Inside Out. 

So I see why you have that opinion but I think this would have just seemed like the same movie again. 

As long as fleshing the world out, well I can only imagine them leaving some room for a sequel as well. The next one being a whole war against the wanderers or something.",kkbd5s
gkjqmfo,"Well that's not what it was. They make the point that the spark was not a passion, but the act of simply being ready to live and enjoy the life in front of you was. It was all about making the most of the journey of life, and not feeling unfulfilled that you've not reached a specific goal.

Although there was an underlying theme of teaching others being Joe's true calling... It was also his primary role when we first see him unfulfilled. Similarly, when he did his gig, he felt similar emptiness because he expected a sustained emotional payload from reaching the destination. These two feelings of disappointment show it wasn't about a specific role or passion.

So if the film just came to the resolution that teaching was Joe's singular passion all along, that would have been a bit cliché and would've left some things unexplained.

The direction they took instead delivered far more emotion and originality than ""Oh, his spark was teaching.""",kkbd5s

I assumed the gag was, Terry was in New York City, and there were a lot of people, and he probably doesn’t know what humans looked like, so his first guess was some random dude who looked close enough from a distance. It never occurred to me it was about race? The odds were against him for several other reasons.

The author’s looking at it from the perspective of constantly searching for reasons of how it depicts race poorly. Is that valid?

Ehhhh, I mean, they can feel how they feel, but at the end of the day I think Soul is a win for just trying to have a black lead, and for making it a significant part of the plot.

Like, what the actual fuck. 

It’s CLEAR that 22 is a SOUL, and does not have a race or gender. How do people not get that?? Yes I get 22 is voiced by a white woman. But the CHARACTER is not a “white woman”. 22 could go on to be born an Asian male, for all we know. If a white woman voices the character of a dog, for instance, would you consider the character a “white woman” or is the character a dog? Is the character of Nala in Lion King a “black woman” because she’s voiced by Beyoncé or is the character a female lion? I mean, damn.

There are dozens of incredibly popular adult animated tv shows (Simpsons, South Park, Family Guy, Rick and Morty, Bob’s Burgers, etc), but for some reason when it comes to movies it’s only for children. 

Most of Pixar’s work in the past has themes, imagery and storylines that cater far more to adults than children. Just because there isn’t swearing, or sex, or intense violence doesn’t mean it’s a kid centric story. 

I think studios like Illumanation and even DreamWorks to a lesser extent with some of their recent properties like Trolls and Boss Baby, are somewhat to blame for this stigma.",kkbd5s

gh4bqlw,"What I took from that scene was that the fish complaining about wanting the ocean doesn't realise that it's already in a part of the ocean, just in a smaller capacity than what it had imagined for itself. 

I think this relates to Joe as a character because he wants to pursue his dream of making it in jazz and playing the jazz club that he frequents. He has this tunnel vision of achieving his dream that he doesn't see that around him, in his life, he is able to fulfil that passion for music in a myriad of different ways. He's part of the ""ocean"" as it were but he can't get passed the idea that he is swimming in a smaller and insufficient part of the ocean.",kkbd5s
gh4d8tp,"I took it slightly differently. I thought it was about having a fantastical idea of what you want that elevates it from what it really is. Joe thought that making a jazz band would be a dramatic change from what he's currently doing and that he would finally realize himself. Once he got what he wanted, he found that it wasn't what he imagined, it was just another job. He was doing what he loved, but he himself wasn't any different and the new job wasn't the perfect ideal that he was looking for.

It's sort of like in Kanye's Good Life, ""having money's not everything, not having it is."" When you have a dream that you haven't achieved, it seems like everything to you and you feel unaccomplished when you haven't realized your dream. Joe even says this multiple times in the movie. Once you get your dream, you find that it isn't everything. You have a whole life outside it, and just accomplishing that one thing didn't solve all your problems.

The fish had a hyped up idea of what he was looking for, an ocean. He feels like that's what he needs even though he already has it. He put expectations on it to fill some hole, but it wasn't the answer he thought he needed.",kkbd5s

There are beautiful things around us but we're missing them because we're letting life wear us down and looking for the big break, not the simple things.

gh1jxpz,"I got the impression that “The Great Beyond” was essentially the termination of the soul.

They seemed like little bugs getting zapped by a bug zapper.",kkbd5s
gh1pxd1,I disagree. Joe went through this whole learning experience but if he went to the great beyond then it would have been for nothing.,kkbd5s
gh1krwp,I kinda feel that was the original ending but because of the pandemic they decided they needed something more uplifting for such a deep movie on this times. There was no such a big emotionally scene on this one compared to other Pixal movies and this could have been that moment.,kkbd5s
gh1usy7,It’s a kids movie still and should not be huge depate ground for people of different religions vs atheists when it didn’t need to be discussed.,kkbd5s
gh3ukpt,I don’t know.  This movie wasn’t about death.  It was about life.  I think exploring the afterlife would have undercut the very effective route they were taking.  It’s not about where you go...it’s about where you are.,kkbd5s
gh1wu9b,"I thought he was going to go through and then his soul would pop up back where the new souls were, as a new soul himself.",kkbd5s
gh1wxiz,"I feel like they may have wrote the ending both ways and ended it with the one where he comes back alive.

I feel like they made the right choice, though, of him choosing life. He learned at the end that there was so much of life he hasn’t lived yet. They great beyond will always be there, but life only happens once. You can only live and experience life once. Why lose that to go to some vague “end” when you realize there is much more of a world to exist in then you thought?",kkbd5s
gh1vrah,"I was frankly disappointed. The moment they returned to Earth, I kinda lost interest. I was hoping the entire movie would take place in the afterlife/prelife and the NYC scenes just didn't captivate me that  much 

 The cop-out at the end of him returning to life anyway wasn't to my liking either - infants die everyday but he gets another chance because he ""inspired"" them. I'm a big Pixar fan, but it looks like this time I don't share the majority opinion",kkbd5s
gh21qy0,Pixar usually makes scenes that's only used in the marketing (as a way to introduce the characters).,kkbd5s

gh5xfa0,"That depressive psyche portrayal for 22 was very good, especially with the self-criticism giants surrounding Joe and relaying the negative talk with booming voices.

gh5jerl,"I already thought it was a bad review when I assumed the writer was black but I held off then because I obviously haven't lived that life. I didn't even realize the writer was white though, what a shit review. We don't even know if 22 is white or black (seeing where she was diving to, probably asian). I criticize things for what they are and Soul wasn't trying to be a racial movie so it doesn't feel fair to criticize it on those grounds although it did seem pretty respectful to the black experience.",kkbd5s

It did feel like Joe was being built up to be a mentor and it would’ve been expected but I know as far as Disney goes, they had to give him that second chance at life. This I don’t mind persay but yeah, something felt off",kkbd5s
gi7nqi8,"I definitely agree. I do also think there were some pacing issues. Joe's big performance with Dorothea and the band could have been longer and grander, since it's literally what the film was leading up to, at that point. 

I also feel like it would have been more believable had he become cynical and tired of performing after a week or so of doing the same thing, since this was the biggest moment of his life. I can imagine that he would have egged himself into playing more, before finally breaking down and realising. Also found it a bit abrupt how Dorothea cracks out that profound story to someone she's only known for a day. 

The ending was also a little unsubstantial. I just wish we could have had him walk down the street, with the breeze blowing and him sniffing the air for pizza. that would have been enough.",kkbd5s
ghr2dj2,The message isn't about what joe does with his life it's about him being connected to the world and others. It's about what brings him joy.

The first time he finds his body the heartrate monitor is still beeping, he’s with the therapy cat and hospital staff are looking for his next of kin— most likely to find out whether/when to pull the plug.

So when he gets in the zone to go back and give 22 the patch he's back to basically being dead. That's why they needed to give him a second chance.,kkbd5s

Even though it is explicit that he is the inspiration, a teacher, a leader, and pulls her out of her funk.  He's so good at inspiring he even gets props from divine beings!

ghde953,"I definitely see where you're coming from, but I think rather than confronting death this movie was mainly focused on living. The message I really took away is that life can be worth living for so many reasons. It's not about finding the one thing you're meant to do (your purpose), but to find meaning and joy out of even the small things. I think this is great message, especially in the world of ""never enough"" that we live in, where everyone is always chasing the next thing so much you can forget to live in the now, the thing you used to be chasing after.",kkbd5s
ghdgo4q,"I share the same feeling that the other reply you got here. The movie is about life, not death (and I definitely feel it is not meant to be a kids movie).

I was feeling the same as you as the movie was reaching the end, but that final line ""How are you gonna spend your life? -  I'm not sure. But I do know I'm going to live every minute of it."" was spot on.  It might sound like a cliche, but that's what the movie is all about.",kkbd5s
ghdnqqm,"I thought this at first, but then it kind of felt like it fit. We don't see Joe's new life. We have to imagine Joe's new life...and I think that's kind of the point.  Fill in the blank how you think he would.             
           
We already confronted death with Joe admitting his life was essentially pointless.          
He focused so much on what he dreamed of he forgot to live around it.         
So many of his memories were basically sad and alone.      
Even when he was with people, like his barber he still was ""alone"". He didn't ask him about his life, he just was stuck on his own dream.",kkbd5s
ghdqk1j,"I think it's because it would leave the viewer really upset at the end and this is a mainstream movie targeting families. Unfortunate, but I'm not mad because either way the real ending is him realizing what a great life he lived and he imbued that to someone else so they could live too.",kkbd5s
ghdw0om,"I don't think so because he was technically in s coma and not 100% dead dead.

Also there are many instances of people coming back to life in the real world.

I feel it truly broadens the overall experience of the movie tbh. I remember saying to myself, they can't end with him going to the afterlife just yet.

I do hope they make a Soul 2 that shows 22 in life and Joe officially going to the afterlife",kkbd5s
ghdgr94,"Agreed.

I thought it's going to be beautiful how the movie ends with 22 being ready for life and Joe being ready for death. But eh, Pixar never really had a full-on hero died ending, so I kinda expected them to cop out in the end.",kkbd5s
ghdg3sw,I understand where you’re coming from. I thought the movie was headed that direction for a while. But I can understand how pointless it would have been for Joe to “learn how to live” and then die. I wish we could have seen some of that being put into practice at the end so it felt more deserved.,kkbd5s
ghxznto,"My interpretation of that is that the Jerry's explained that they and the reality of the Before/Beyond is seen by souls the way they can understand it. Living in a modern world, it makes sense that they would adjust from time to time to meet the needs of humans in current society. The You Seminar probably gets reinterpreted quite a bit to keep up with the changes in society/culture",kkbd5s
gi81lwr,"It's just an easy and fun way to explain these concepts. Besides, the Jerrys are all an abstract construct inside Joe's head. I imagine that's the case for the Great Before. It's represented in a way which would be familiar and understandable for Joe.",kkbd5s

ghane9d,"There's some hypothesis in the Grateful Dead community that it's a nod to Jerry Garcia, who helped bring about many people's experiences with a universal consciousness. Probably not accurate but still fun to think about.

I agree the animation of the beforelife was stunning, I saw a lot of reviews saying they enjoyed the real world scenes but the supernatural elements of Soul were just a retread of the kind of world we saw in Inside Out. I disagree, I thought the balance between the two locations (breathtaking animated New York and the supernatural realm) were great.

The one thing that seemed off to me was the facial animations during speaking. Idk what it was, but it seemed off compared to the insanely high quality facial animations of other pixar films. Maybe it was just stylized.",kkbd5s

One example, I was 8 and got a microscope. I put my hair under it and it looked so cool! I never thought hair would have structure. I ran out to the living room where a relative was visiting and asked who else wants to see this cool thing, and said relative responded ""ew, no! gross! I'll pass"". That upset 8 year old me pretty hard, but it's something I doubt they'd remember today.

gh39fe1,"I need a bit of clarification about the spark tho. Isn't it something that is found before the souls leave to earth? Like how all the other souls had a specific interest that became their spark in their life.

But the msg that jerry wanted to highlight to Joe was that a spark is not that simple. Then how does it work for the other souls as they find that spark way before they enter earth but it took 22 going to earth before finding her spark (which probably resonates with the theme of the movie about what you said about Joe and 22 finding their spark for living.

ghhpf9d,"I agree but I don't think the fact that it's a kids movie should have prevented them from exploring those ideas. Kids are not immune to the feelings of hopelessness and doubt and this film does not really at any point present any truly meaningful and believable alternative. It does not show how people actually overcome those issues. 22 just comes back from being lost because Joe shows up and was like, ""hey you like leaf rite?? pizza good"".

Yea... pizza good is not good enough for existential dread lol. A real message would have been that to truly overcome the reality that life is meaningless requires some element of self deception. People merely succeed in distracting themselves from that fact and that's fine because that's really all we can do. The whole happy cartoon afterlife world sort of takes away from that in terms of the stakes of the film.",kkbd5s
ghyn95k,"Pretty much. Spark =/= Purpose seems to be the main message of the film. A spark is just anything that makes you excited about life. Any one of 22's random experiences could have been her first spark, or all of them. But that doesn't define her purpose in life. 

Jazz is clearly Joe's spark, since it brings him so much joy. But it isn't necessarily his purpose in life. Performing jazz isn't going to give Joe some cosmic closure. It's just something he enjoys. Early on he judges his life as meaningless because he failed to pursue his supposed purpose of playing jazz. But when Joe plays piano near the end he reflects on all the experiences that he previously judged as failures and he realizes they were all wonderful and unique experiences in and of themselves.",kkbd5s
ghxj75o,"It was trying to show how one particular thing made the soul 'want to live', maybe playing basketball, baking gave the soul the 'want' to experience life. It is purposely misconstrued as the soul's purpose as a way to misdirect the audience to hide the reveal at end with 22. At least this was how I interpreted it.

TL;DR: Yes, exactly what u wrote.",kkbd5s

I think what you're complaint is, and I agree, is that they told us this stuff in exposition and dialogue, instead of showing it to us through character action.  It's always better in fiction to show, rather than tell.  Not sure why Pixar chose to do it that way....maybe they were trying to be really lean and efficient with the script and have a shorter runtime.",kkbd5s
gh1snv3,"> The thing is, we don’t ever really see him “not living”.

My guess is that his determination to achieve his singular 'purpose' was him not 'living'. True, reclusive introverts aren't 'living', but maybe also people who are really laser-focused on a particular goal for their whole lives are missing out (or not recognizing the importance of) the things that make life what it is. At the beginning of the movie he thought the scene of himself eating pie alone was sad, because surely if he was an accomplished and respected musician he'd never eat alone like that. But at the end of the movie it was a cherished memory because hey, he was happy and it was tasty pie. 

I'm not saying one way or another whether they pulled it off, but my guess is that's what they were going for.",kkbd5s
gh1tjki,"Yes i agree too! The movie was quite short to begin with. His life would've been a lot more relatable if they had shown him coasting through it. All we see are all its aftermaths - the barber being happy to talk about himself to Joe, his mom knowing that his hobby is more of an obsession.

gh9ezrb,"Nah - here’s my take on why the counselors decided Joe should live: he had learned his lesson on what it really means to live: there is no huge umbrella Purpose with a capital P that people must fulfill while living. Living is about embracing the moments that make us feel alive: like mentoring and teaching others, listening to others’ stories (like the barber), enjoying music by other artists, eating pizza and bagels from a local shop, watching leaves fall.

So, he was in the zone twirling the sign and was helping lost souls. But when the ship ""sinks"" he is not in the zone anymore. So I think he is saluting like saying ""I've completed my sign twirling."" I think Moonwind just leaves then to find another endeavor/activity/job that gets him in the zone and where he can also help lost souls.

This interpretation makes sense to me too because the “free spirits” I know go from job to job or in other ways are always wandering and finding joy in the world.

The difference isn't in Inside Out being less successful at that, the difference is that it felt like slightly less of a priority for Inside Out, it was an important part of the movie but not neccesarily the most important part, unlike with this movie where the existential questions were really front and center.",kkbd5s

From a narrative perspective, I feel it had to happen this way. While it may feel somewhat cheap, having a character who lives his entire life obsessed with something and then dies only after finally realizing that he had never really taken the time to *live* his life would just be horribly unsatisfying.

That said, it's also worth noting that he never actually *died.* That's repeated several times throughout the movie. His soul was simply disconnected to his body. He was in a coma of sorts.",kkbd5s

I can see why someone would have complaints if they wanted a movie that was more about the black experience. But that wasn't really what the film was about, at least, not in the way the author seems to want. I can get a sense of their disappointment, I can get a sense of what the creators were going for, and I can understand why the things that worked for me worked. They're all legitimate.

At least, except for saying it's bad because they killed the lead so quickly into the film. It's a movie about the afterlife. It's kind of like saying The Wizard of Oz is a bad movie because Dorthy leaves Kansas so quickly. I can understand why someone might prefer a film about the struggles of a young girl in rural Kansas, but to say it's categorically bad because it ended up being about something they didn't want it to be about it just pretty silly.",kkbd5s

gh5hjfq,"When I saw the trailer I had the exact same thought. Seemed like BS that for how beautifully animated and how amazing the story looked when he was alive, it seemed like a cop out to me that he'd be a blue dot for a bit. Then I was frustrated when he had a chance to go back and ended up as a cat while this white women was in his body. But then, as the story progressed I fell in love with how their characters developed and it resonated deeply for me. I remember the moment where it goes from Joe telling 22 to repeat after him, and then the camera pans over and he's just seamlessly telling his mother how he really feels for the first time in his life, I literally got chills.

&#x200B;

I think objectively, this movie isn't really about Joe's race at all, so if you look at it from that perspective purely, there are definitely solid criticisms. It's still frustrating to me that it seems like Disney/Pixar is too scared to write stories with Black leads that don't make them easier for white audiences to empathize with by transforming them into an animal like Princess and the Frog, or literally putting a white person inside their body like in this movie, but at the same time it's not something that takes the magic away completely for me at all. So, for racial representation its not the greatest, but as a Black dude who has been dealing with a LOT of existential dread for the last few years, yeah I fuckin loved it. In short, it's definitely a solid criticism, but doesn't necessarily detract from the impact the movie still has. The problem mostly lies in their marketing of this as the first Black Pixar film when it was really a movie about humanity and what keeps us going.",kkbd5s

gh72hrl,"I think it just made more thematic sense he got a second chance because he finally discovered what the spark was. That it wasn't a purpose, but just a will to start living.

It'd be emotional if he died sure, but it'd be incongruous to him learning to start living life if he never got a chance to actually do it. I think the impact came in the movie not actually showing us *what* he does with his life from this point forward, only that we know he's doing it.",kkbd5s

Also, you don't have to one day appreciate every moment of life and then exist like that forever. Practicing mindfulness is important, yeah, but you're only human.

At the heart of the film is the message to live every day like it’s your last and to be ‘present’ in every situation. The following anecdote from the film captures this sentiment: “I heard this story about a fish, he swims up to an older fish and says: ‘I’m trying to find this thing they call the ocean.’ ‘The ocean?’ the older fish says, ‘that’s what you’re in right now.’ ‘This’, says the young fish, ‘this is water.

Also Jerry ""Your purpose, your meanings of life... so basic.""

Jazzing is just living life, your own way, and just improvising, which is an important element of Jazz. Life is more that the sum of its parts. Joe thought Music and piano was the part that would fulfill him, he thought that it was his spark, but it was the confluences of his life experience.

I know it’s the whole point of the movie, but I could’ve done without the whole little blue souls and afterlife thing. The beginning scene felt like a bait and switch once his soul got to the afterlife. (DISCLAIMER: I didn’t watch any trailers before watching this film, so I didn’t expect any of the afterlife stuff) Seeing his soul reduced to a blue cute thing... it robbed us of what could’ve been a great story of a black man trying to balance a life of teaching and a life of performing. I really wanted to see more interactions of him with the trombone girl, trying to inspire his students. If they were going do the whole afterlife thing, why couldn’t he have looked more like himself in the afterworld? Coco did it so well with their afterlife characters.

Personally I think I would've enjoyed a more grounded film just based on ordinary people like Joe. Hard to sell toys like that or sell it to kids though. The body swap shenanigans didn't really work for me either...it feels like something I've seen that plenty of times before.

I think what could've worked better is if they had focused more on the music aspect. If the afterlife was shaped by one's perception, it would've been a simple explanation to allow them to play more with jazz and make the entire afterlife have a musical theme since we're looking through Joe's eyes.

You've articulated almost exactly how I feel about this movie. 

It really felt like a lot of ideas thrown together in a manner that doesn't totally fit - many of which we've seen before! 

For instance, Pixar has done body swap - Brave, has done a musician who gets stuck in some version of death/limbo - Coco, abstract blob shaped characters representing personality - Inside Out. 

The animation was fantastic. The music, when it was there was good - but for a movie titled Soul it just didn't have enough music for me. 

The biggest fault for me was the muddled up messaging. Also, the ending with the 'save' felt like a tacked on studio decision - rather uncharacteristic of Pixar. 

Pixar movies are generally not afraid to go to dark places - and they nearly did with this failing, unfulfilled musician but they just did not follow through on that. In my opinion anyway.",kkbd5s

When reflecting on his life, he feels he's wasted part of his life and yet at the same time he's had this amazing impact on the kids he's taught and he doesn't recognize it, at least not until he's forced to look at it. 

It strikes me as a colorful, trippy, animated take on It's A Wonderful Life.",kkbd5s

gh8ealt,"In my view, I agree with the answers here, that the spark is not actually a purpose, but the mindset that enables a soul to savour mindful moments in life (which is a pillar of the psychology of well being, as researched by Dr. Laurie Santos at Yale). When souls are getting a spark, they are just experimenting things they might savour on earth. The kid with the ball in the Hall discovered that football is interesting and can create mindful moments, so they got a spark from that. 22 found this spark on earth, by savouring life itself, not the previews of the Halls.

In the ""mindful moment"" before she ran away (which the story implies it was the turning point), what motivated her to run and stay on earth was the pursuit of purpose: she really wanted to find the spark, unaware that by really wanting something, the ""wanting"" was the spark itself; It made her willing to savour mindful moments on earth.",kkbd5s

Sure, but Joe's whole life revolves around jazz because that *is* what brings him the most happiness. Living his life with that jazz mindset and taking the moments as they come is what is going to allow him to enjoy life.

But then what is he going to do differently? He seemed to find enjoyment in teaching 22, as well as his current and former band students, and expressed an empty dissatisfaction with his dream gig.

So what is he going to do differently? Like what effect did this realization actually have on his life? He's just going to enjoy the taste of pizza and pay attention to falling leaves?

gh1lppu,">1. The lost soul version of 22 was way out of left field. The climax feels so similar to Ralph Breaks the internet, whose 3rd act was also just a weird tone shift.

The idea of this was 22's idea of life was much like the stock broker earlier in the film. Having ""lived"" life and thinking you are a failure in life itself, then it disconnects you from life entirely, hence why she was a lost soul, just hit slightly harder since she technically never ""lived"" and already was told they were a failure.

>2. There seems to be a motif of teaching throughout the movie, seeing as Joe is a teacher for band but he also mentors 22 through the Great Beyond and through life. However, nothing about this is raised in the ending. Connie is no longer in the picture. Maybe this is nit picky, but I wish there was some payoff in some way through teaching.

As much as teaching was the theme, I dont think knowing whether or not that was Joe's calling is relevant. Teaching was his means to an end, whereas performing jazz was his 'definition of what success is' even though when he had it, it wasnt the success he hyped it up to be. If anything, he inspired himself through inspiring 22. He could do anything he wants at this point and inspire others. He could create a band tomorrow and inspire a whole new group of people wanting to play. The world is his now.

>3. While 22’s ending is ambiguous, which is fine as the viewer can guess what happens next, Joe’s ending is so abrupt. Not only does he get a cop out ending of “You can go back because you did good lmao” make his choice to give the badge to 22 meaningless, but it also makes it frustrating that the film just ends 5 seconds after that. This may be wanting too much, but we never see Joe apply the lessons he learned in his life. He just goes back and credits roll immediately. Something just felt off.

As it should. He was dead inside the entire movie. He solely focused on being a ""success"" to what his defined success would look like and his life passed him by. He wad what many 40-50's olds become, with this idea that ""I could have been X but this happened and I can never do it now"" His death was literal but he was just as much as a lost soul as any other. 

The end of the movie was his taking his life back and defining what success looks like to him, NOT TO THE AUDIENCE..but to Joe himself. He owned that.

Great movie",kkbd5s

They addressed that in Joe’s flashback scene (where it shows him inspiring his former student who becomes a talented musician). I’m not sure if they answered whether he took the gig as a jazz player or went back to teaching.

It was abrupt but the piano scene was supposed to answer his shift in how he has changed. He no longer saw his spark as solely being a jazz musician but realized that the spark was moments in one’s life that make them feel like life is worth living. The movie ending on an open, unanswered question on what Joe did because that’s how he wants to live his life now. He spent the latter years fixated on making his dreams reality that he filtered out everything that wasn’t related to jazz (not contacting Lisa, talking non-stop to barber about Jazz when he didn’t even know anything about him, having flashbacks to him spending special moments with his parents in different stages in his life, etc). They abruptly left it open at the end to drive home the idea that Joe is no longer fixated on Jazz and is open to anything. I do agree that the cop out was kinda dumb but it would also be equally dumb to have Joe randomly “die” playing the piano doing nothing.

But letting the ending be ambiguous drives with more impact the overall message, ""It's okay to live, your life doesn't need a grand purpose in order to have value. Your life won't start someday, it's happening right now"". Giving Joe a clear answer to his ""riddle"" (how to enjoy his life) in the form of a career/life path would have undermined that. 

The point is that whatever path Joe will choose, he will make sure to live his life to the fullest, maybe he will be teaching in the school full-time and making sure other kids learn their passion for music, or maybe he will stick with Dorothea's band and become famous, or maybe will be combining both paths, etc, they are all valid. 

About the Great Beyond & Before, it reminds me more of the Inside Out design decisions to represent abstract and psychological concepts. Jerry and 22 said that the place was basically how your puny human brain interprets stuff, so a possible explanation is that in Joe's eyes the afterlife was fairly neutral considering he wasn't a particularly religious person. (This was probably for the best, religion is always a complicated subject and the movie already feels loaded with the whole ""what's the purpose of life?"" question, so they probably opted to incorporate other aspects of Afro-american culture in Joe's environment and journey)",kkbd5s

\#1. I dont’ believe it ever said he was. Where did you get this idea from?

\#2. It’s not, 22 knows how to get there but it’s separate, just like how the Great Beyond is separate from the Great Before but you can still get there if you know how

\#3. Agree, this was pretty transparent writing. As long as a movie doesn’t take its own bad writing too seriously, I don’t mind it. They basically tell us up front “Here’s some nonsense so that we can move the plot forward.”

\#4. I don’t really know how to answer this, the movie established several times you need an Earth Pass to be alive on Earth. We saw Joe drop dead like 3 times in this movie right where he stood.

\#5. It was a pretty harmless cat gag, but yes, the cat was entirely inconsistent in this movie.

gh5om0t,"Just watched the movie and your questions and feelings basically exactly echo mine. I'm actually a bit relieved I found this, because while I thought the voice acting and animation were amazing (probably the best I've seen), I really didn't feel this was even close to Pixar's best outing. Like you said, a lot of the metaphysics stuff became a bit convoluted and hand wavy. Which is fine, I get it, it's ultimately supposed to be for kids. However, I feel like the amount of time and dialogue they spend grappling with these abstract concepts didn't allow the film to BREATHE at all. Like, there was new information in nearly every scene really until the point where he plays piano to enter the ""zone"" to go back to the Great Before and find 22's lost soul. 

I'm also so glad you brought up Inside Out. I feel that movie dealt with abstract concepts so much better, with less plot holes and didn't try to jam pack its world with so much back story. Even despite the subject material being more interesting to me in Soul, I related so much more to Inside Out.

Pete Docter is my favorite Pixar director and jazz is my favorite music genre so I really did expect to love this film, but I just didn't. I completely agree with you that I think they should have spent more time in reality with Joe in his own body trying to deal with finding his purpose in life, but I also understand it would have changed the entire framework of the story.

I have watched Onward a few times now when I want to watch something familiar and wholesome.

Soul didn't do anything for me because ultimately the story felt too disjointed. There were a few highlights, like the moment with his mom or his barber, but it lacked the same emotional punch when you realize it wasn't Joe experiencing them, but watching 22 experience them in his body.

Joe's obsession with jazz and insistence that it is his purpose culminates when he feels empty after hitting the highest point in his life. One of the Jerrys says it aloud that purpose isn't singular, and is a rigid meaning Joe has given to a spark. This is highlighted in the fact that ""The Zone,"" where someone is popping off with their spark of inspiration or attention is also the bridge to becoming a lost soul- it showcases how belief in a singular purpose can lead to obsession and a downward spiral.

If Joe had just become a mentor or found that his true calling was teaching instead of jazz or something, that would've gone against the movie's end theme. Spark is a one reason to live, it's the inspiration. But it isn't the only reason, nor should it be.",kkbd5s

We all have tons of shared experiences (strong emotions, weak emotions, complex emotions, songs getting stuck in your head, fading memories, etc.). Inside Out played in the sandbox of our minds.

As a matter of fact, they took his whole damn body and gave it to 22. Feels like the bones were strong enough between his teaching, the jazz, the family, the scenery, the club, etc to build upon without needing whiny 22's boring milquetoast cardboard woe-is-me storyline. It was so refreshing to see new characters on-screen other than DreamworksFace and AnnaElsaRapunzelDisneyFace.... and they were sidelined for more of Inside Out's visual representations of abstract concepts.

But by the time he falls down we already know so much about Joe, and are so invested in his career and his fate.

We know that he’s a little downtrodden, but still kind, has a contentious relationship with his mother, but still talks with her, and is kind of a loser, but keeps getting back up when life knocks him down.

Yeah, but you're not Joe. 

And he wasn't designed to be the most likable character. That's the point.

Dude had likable *qualities,* but he was really stuck in his own ass for most of the movie.

He had to start off that way in order to have a compelling arc.

I mean really, look at a lot of Pixar's protagonists:

 You have Bob, from The Incredibles who definitely had his share of unlikable traits before realizing what mattered.

You have Marlin, who was a paranoid mess due to his trauma.

Hell, you have Woody who was a self-absorbed jerk for most of Toy Story 1.

Carl was also a jerk for a lot of Up.

I think what was probably missing is that the film doesn't directly show you Joe's childhood and stuff from the beginning. For all of the other protagonists, we saw how they got that way at the *start* of the movie.

But that doesnt mean that those characters were really likable for a lot of their respective movies.

Do you think your opinion may have changed if we saw Joe as a child from the beginning, learning to enjoy Jazz?

As it stands, it seems like there wasnt enough for you to latch onto Joe from the beginning, which is fair.

ghhe37r,"I completely disagree about making the theme mentoring instead.  Inspirational mentorship is a story that's been told so many times it's basically a genre.  Or at least a trope, and one that's starting to border on cliche.  I thought it was refreshing to have a movie tell people in mentor-type roles that they should get fulfillment from a variety of sources rather than putting the act of inspiring others on a pedestal.  Clearly mentorship is important, but for the people doing the mentoring, especially those who have jobs where they mentor others, it's not healthy to invest all of your identity and self-worth into that one thing, which is a message I think a lot of those ""Your true impact is in the people around you!"" inspirational stories sort of unwittingly send.

I also think reducing the lesson Joe learned to ""enjoy the little things"" misses out on quite a bit of nuance.  Joe has a really goal-oriented way of living his life that is almost paradoxical for an improvisational musician.  His time watching 22 live in his body and ""jazzing"" creates thematic parallels between his improvisational jazz music and his approach to living life.  In order to do truly great things with his music, he has to get lost and live in the moment, which coincidentally happens to be the thing he also needs to do in order to lead a fulfilling life.  It's not any one thing--not professional jazz music, and not teaching--that is going to get Joe the most out of life.  It's an approach similar to the one he takes to his music.  He's got to play around a little. Find his footing, figure out the key he's in, and then just go.",kkbd5s

So he returns to give her life, because he’s “already had his.” And it was a good one. A meaningful one. A life that inspired. And he’s finally realized that. Finally realized that his life had meaning all along.

And that’s why he’s ready to let go. 

He could have gone Beyond then, and it wouldn’t have been sad. Because we saw his life had meaning and - more importantly- so did Joe. But the Jerries gave him another chance.

And when he took it? He took it with the understanding that life is about living. And for as long as it was his to have, Joe was going LIVE.",kkbd5s
ghhourz,"Frankly I felt it wasn't really ""depressing"" ENOUGH. They approach a huge amount of hard truths about the reality of life but they don't ever really directly confront them... instead relying on the feel good ending of putting him back in his body via this mystical afterlife mechanism. They talk about lost souls but they don't actually deal with the long and miserable reality of what it's like trying to *really* help a person like that. They bring up the idea that life not having a purpose is why people get there... but don't really satisfactorily make an argument for why life does or doesn't have a purpose, it just kind of gets glossed over with a vague sense of... I dunno, sheer willpower to live. But in reality that doesn't work. Sheer willpower isn't enough to solve problems like the ones that people are having in this film, in fact trying to rely on sheer willpower alone to solve emotional issues often results in falling even deeper into a hole.

They also propose the ludicrous idea that people's personalities are somehow inherent to their mystical being or something which completely glosses over the fact that a person's identity and traits are the product of the events you experience growing up at least as much if not more than they are products of your genes or a 'soul'. It promotes a terrible worldview which could lead to people thinking that their traits are set in stone which leads to the incredibly common view that certain people can become lost causes, not worthy of redemption...

I dunno, for someone who is truly depressed I would say this film might even do more harm than good. It doesn't address the real issues that lost or depressed people are acutely aware of. Instead it just tries to go for a sort of shallow feel-good hope that rings a bit hollow. The shallow pathos is more depressing to me than the film would have been if it had been more realistically depressing but also went further in exploring how people ACTUALLY come to terms with the fact that life has no inherent meaning.",kkbd5s

In the end, he achieved his dream, and while it turned out not to be as great as he imagined, the movie doesn't exactly suggest he quits either. And I presume either way, even if he doesn't want the gig, he could still go back to teaching. For some reason the movie skipped over that he really seemed passionate about sharing his love of music, but seemed to consider it a hold-over job.

As for the lesson you got about family members dying, I'd say that's a stretch. Surely kids understand that death doesn't necessarily work that way, and you could always apply the reverse logic: his body was clinging to life, and that narrative was what he experienced in the meantime.

The meditation thing is actually a real belief in mysticism. While listening to the sign-spinning guy, you can actually hear him say something about ""astral projection"" and some would claim that is a way to talk to the dead. *Not going to say any of this is true, but there is a base of information they were working from so it's not entirely out of left field.

gh4xs7e,"I totally agree with the other reply on the balance thing. I saw that they did a lot of research into various world faiths for the film, and I walked away from the film thinking there was a real Buddhist slant to the messaging. The idea of the 'middle way' and that there's more happiness to be found in moderation, rather than total deprivation and the hyperfixation that Joe has in the film.

It sounds like in many ways the film has brought up a lot of questions of what happiness means to you as well. The purpose of life and happiness in life is like, a pretty heady topic, I'm not entirely surprised it's caused you to have a visceral reaction when your family aren't on the same page with you. But, broadly, if I had to give my two cents, it's that the idea of being happy in the moment is not antithetical to the idea of setting goals—it's just that we should be careful in understanding that we've all set the implicit intent of any goal as making ourselves happy. And by setting that expectation, we invite suffering. If that conversation with your family really hit you, it's really worth assessing your relationship to your goals in life.

The film doesn't actually claim whether Joe's goal to become an accomplished jazz pianist was right or wrong, and I don't think there's any real indication the film makes towards Joe deciding to quit or anything at the end, just that hyperfixating on his goal invited negativity into the rest of his life.

Everything matters, and nothing matters :)",kkbd5s

But the trick is to find a job that you can enjoy which Joe did but suddenly it wasn't enough? Joe frankly needs to have a long reflective think on what he wants from life because damn he comes across as so naive about life and earning a living.

And what does that have to do with the final moral of life's little moments? They don't connect at all. Who cares about little moments when you've found your dream job?

I think my annoyance mostly stems from the contrivance of Joe not being fulfilled by his new job. I get that it can happen to people but this film shoves it in our face that jazz is so important to him until the plot dictates it isn't. Ugh.",kkbd5s

It felt downright insulting, to be honest. 

Also, the fact that he felt like benefits, pension, etc were not worth it? In this economy? Seriously?

""Look at the trees, smell the air, and then you'll be happy.""
Says someone from NYC in a paid apartment with a social circle. 

This films message really felt condescending, we don't live in a world where just existing is easy. You can't ""just exist"" in this world. You can't just ""enjoy the trees"" when literally everything in this world expects you to support them by working long hours being away from the actual people you love in life, just to support them. And then they treat you badly because you are supposedly not there enough for them. But you're literally doing everything in your power to support them. Its just stupid. This film has a idealization of life that is so very untrue. If Pixar wanted to make a film with adult themes and messaging. It should of been way more better than this. 

There are people like myself who have been lost in this fog of unknowing for 5 years and counting now, after I graduated highschool. All my school friends moved or stopped talking to me. Ive been mostly just at home and at work for all those 5 years. I cant seem to find out what type of job I want to do for the rest of my life you know?

It's still good to have a goal in mind, but just to not let it consume you to the point where one becomes like the lost souls on the astral plane.

Look, I’m a musician and teacher too but, perhaps at first, I was driven by the rush of performing and being the best, now I still work with music inspiring kids to play and looking to do a PhD in ethnomusicology and I get a lot of satisfaction from that. Music is a big part of my life but it’s not my only focus and passion.  I am not defined.  I let the flow of life lead me.  Meaning is in the everyday things and people you spend time with.  Don’t define yourself by what you do for a living.  You haven’t wasted life, it’s actually impossible to do.  I would recommend therapy massively.",kkbd5s

The film just made me feel like it’s telling me to give up and that it doesn’t even matter if it makes me happy because I’m not perpetually living in the moment.

IMO, the ending should have been:

* 22 gives Joe Earth Pass (same as movie)
* Joe selfishly returns to Earth (same as movie)
* Joe does the gig, it goes well, but he's left unsatisfied (same as movie)
* Feeling guilt, he tries to return ""into the zone"" playing music to return to 22, but he finds that he can't fully get into the zone
* Some time passes, montage reveals that Joe goes on to get several successful professional gigs, still teaches, but grows increasingly detached from his students and his personal relationships/mother as he focuses on his professional career
* Moonwind yanks Joe out of the zone, revealing that Joe has been a lost soul during this time, his successful musical career was the product of his obsession with fame
* He returns to school the next day and teaches class, but learning from his experience at the barbershop, he proactively engages the students in their interests.  Something something kids are into video games, so Joe has them play the BGM from Wreck It Ralph to develop a cross-interest in music.
* Joe finds himself ""in the zone"" while teaching the kids music
* Joe rescues 22
* Rest of the movie is the same",kkbd5s
ghf1ljb,"Lol that is missing the point.

Joe needed to conquer his dream for him to realize that it was not the most important thing in life.

He needed to have that personal arc of his completed before realizing how to help 22. 

Until he conquered his dream, Joe was always going to be a selfish prick about things. His arc was all about finally slowing the fuck down and understanding that he's actually missing out on 'living.'

He does own up to how he treated 22 when he finally realizes his own mistakes.

gh9jnb7,"I don’t think you deserve your downvotes but I disagree that the movie was about being content with just living. It was more about realizing that Joe was so absorbed with finding some sort of goal that he forgets to appreciate that life isn’t just the goal and fulfilling your passions. It’s about learning to appreciate everything around you. To paraphrase a quote in the movie “I want the ocean. All this is just water”

Honestly what I got from it was a sorta nihilistic vibe, but not the “nothing matters everything is fucked” nihilism, the kind where you realize that there is no “higher purpose” to life except what you choose to live it for and to enjoy what’s around you.",kkbd5s
gh9jcxa,"I didn't get this out of it at all. I think the only thing the movie glorifies is mindfulness and living in the moment. It purposely skirts the question of the pursuit of ambition vs. playing it safe. Joe might go back to his life and play in the quartet, or he might go back and teach. He might pursue any number of dreams. It's deliberate that we aren't shown.

Every Pixar film often feels like it has a checklist of 'make audiences cry' and you get to That scene of the film and think 'yep, this is the part that I am supposed to cry'. This film is the only one that dodges this. There's no designated 'crying scene', but the scenes that will make you sad come from two things. One, highly authentic dialogue with friends/family about economic security versus following your dreams. Two, genuine questions about what makes us ourselves and what defines our purpose. It's not sad in a 'awww sentimental' way, but more because the themes explored are easily applied to one's own life.",kkbd5s
gh4xj7r,"The spark is the feeling.  Like, the reason those new souls have to go try a bunch of stuff is to find something that tips them over into ""that was so amazing that I get it--I want to go to earth and live.""  It's not that shooting a bow and arrow is the singular activity that gives them fulfillment and purpose--it's an experience that tipped them over the edge and made them excited about life.  It could have just as easily been solving a math problem or climbing a tree, because we all have lots of little things that can cause that enjoyment of life.  22 had a hard time because they couldn't find any one thing that convinced them it was worth going to earth to live.  Experiencing Joe's life finally put them over the tipping point because they got to experience lots of small moments that made life on earth a worthwhile thing--pizza, a man singing beautifully in a subway station, shooting the breeze at the barber shop, helicopter seeds floating down in fall.  It wasn't any one thing or activity that was 22's spark, it was the cumulative effects of appreciating all those little things.",kkbd5s
gh4w7uk,"My understanding is the 'spark' is kind of the feeling of joy/being in the right place that you can get from things you love, people you love, or even the simple things like seeing a leaf fall.

gh1zb6k,I think it was more “don’t forget to stop and smell the roses.” It’s not that pursuing a dream is bad - it’s that life is wonderful even if you’re just doing a boring job with a pension. At least that’s what I took from it.,kkbd5s
gh3coph,"22 seemed to always be told what the world is like, but 22 never got to see it. All these 'incredible"" mentors are people that just wanted to explain the world, but Joe was able to show 22 what the world was really like, and I think 22 got a full picture of the world both bad and good. 22 realized that the meaning isn't what you want to do, it's not what you do to survive, it's the little moments throughout life that makes us who we are.

Joe doesn't realize the amount of life that he is missing because he's so blatantly focused on wanting to ""reach the mountaintop"" of jazz. 22 helps Joe to realize that your life isn't and shouldn't be focused on just one thing, like the lost soul of the stock trader. My theory is that Joe would become a lost soul if he continued only caring about what's next, and started caring more about who he's hurting by not saying what's happening now. 

22 said his life was sad, but that's the point. Humanity isn't all about happiness. Without other emotions, there is nothing to base the happiness on. The argument they seem to be making is that you can't be human until you realize your range of emotions (which builds into Inside Out). There is a strong connection between these two movies.",kkbd5s

In particular, as someone who has depression and regular, intense suicidal thoughts, this movie touched on all of my repressed fears, my lack of purpose and the sense of hopelessness I feel about the future. I think the people who worked on creating this movie truly understand the thoughts and emotions I feel on a daily basis, and it moved me. It makes me feel understood. It makes me feel like I'm not alone. Hearing you say 22 is an awful character tells me that you do not relate to those feelings at all. Not that that is a bad thing, but it seems as though you hold disregard for the portion of very real people that 22 is based off of. Her personality is molded around that lack of purpose and direction that she feels, covering it up with sarcasm and pessimism so as to avoid confronting those feelings. It's a coping mechanism that is employed by so many actual people. Her character is *real*. That's why it's good. 

That aside, the whole spirit aspect of the movie isn't as literal as you seem to be understanding it. Joe never died in the first place, he was just in a coma.

To the point of Joe's feelings after his performance. He wasn't bored....he just realized that this dream he's chasing doesn't mean as much in the grand scheme of things.

gw4yknn,"The message is to enjoy the caveats and nuances during this journey, majority of us only get to live it once after all. I am aware of the horrible shit that happens around us, and being angry about the cards you've been dealt won't fix it. I've been learning to appreciate it, making the best you can with what you have and allow others to do so to. You sound like you gotta live more and let live.

About the disney thing, yeah they're fucked but great movie. Really makes you think if you let it sink instead of just ranting on your phone.",kkbd5s
gzjx47n,"If you're going to be so bold to call out that 22 is voiced by a ""middle aged white lady"" then let me dig at this a little bit because to me, that explanation of her using her voice to ""annoy people"" has a purpose for being added into the script.  
Ever heard of this new thing called Karen?  
Disney clearly made a conscious choice to use a ""white lady"" to represent a soul that houses pretty much all of human knowledge throughout time (So does basically everybody who has a connection to the internet), and doesn't care(and the people doesn't care either) -- much like how white people are responsible for colonizing and indoctrinating the whole planet and don't care about how it damaged indigineous and sovereign countries everywhere.(All of the colonizing white people are dead but yeah)  
You even get to see 22 ""mess with"" souls that are ""in the zone"" -- the Knicks joke especially(reading in a lot in this?) -- cute way to joke about how white supremacy basically controls who advances and who doesn't even when they're fully in their element(white supremacy controls who advances? you mean the people at the top who for the most part in america happen to be of fairer complexion?).  
She's clearly unappreciative of all of her experiences and knowledge because she ""doesn't have a purpose"" because for her, she needed to be physically in touch with the planet to start giving a shit about it(this is such a young person opinion thinking knowledge is above everything back to the internet point).  
Sorry, but if that didn't give out ""Get Out"" vibes to anyone else, then perhaps the glittery Disney magic did its job by blowing magic and meme references at you to distract you(dont know what you meant by this).  
2. You really can't convince me that this was written from a ""poor man's"" perspective(no you are putting him out to be a poor man), because that man is working 80+ hours a week just trying to SURVIVE. Even Joe Gardner doesn't fit the ""every man"" in 2020 (try maybe 1995 when there was still a middle class) as relatable as they tried to make him by being a middle school band teacher(for people to be able to relate to someone that just needs to be a someone this representation crap is just that).  
ALSO --- this weird false narrative that teachers are looked down on in the music industry like theyre jokes is a bit caricaturistic and outdated -- with most of the working class being the millennial generation now, none of us who have made it into the music industry would ever roll our eyes at a teacher breaking out(does she strike you as a woman of the millennial generation?). This is a toxic and hyperbolic representation of how musicians are with each other (speaking as a musician and music teacher my damn self) and people who act like Dorothea are QUICKLY getting phased out and are irrelevant precisely for that gatekeeping attitude( what exactly is she doing wrong? great to bring your all reaching knowledge  and experience in an say it ). Way to show how ""in touch"" you are with the people, Disney. You did so great with Mulan.   
3. Delving deeper behind the Disney ""warm and fuzzy"" mirage -- stop fucking telling people they need to ""stop and smell the roses"" when you CLEARLY KNOW the level of stress and anxiety that people get to DEBILITATES THEM from seeing the ""bigger picture.""(yes movies should just be like the news and just be fucking depressing bc that is what life is like… In a bubble much?)  
You know what thats like? That's like the emporer telling the pillars of an empire to ""take a break"" but not let the empire fall(yeah thinking that you if you take a miss step everything fail is a great way to have stress and anxiety that DEBILITATES ). It doesn't work like that(when did you last try if it worked or not?). And giant conglomerate companies like Disney who have the power to vacuum up every other independently standing creative industry out there -- you fucking know this, and its disgustingly sick and twisted(i didnt get this).  
Why did you make light of the megalomaniac soul(why do you make light of all of the negativ things your read in to the movie)? Why did you make 5 insecure souls and 12 arrogant ones()? Why do you keep subtly pointing out that the assholes and jerks and powerful are the ones that get all the benefit of human suffering -- INCLUDING 22(you do mean to say you do not feel like it feels like that)??  
This whole movie felt like a passive aggressive stab from the delusional 1% down to the ""lowly people"" to be grateful they get to smell B.O. on a subway cause ""that's what living is all about"" -- if that's the case, THEN REDISTRIBUTE YOUR FUCKING WEALTH so we can ALL enjoy the spinny leaf falling from the autumn tree and NOT think about how we're going to keep our family together or our rent paid ().  
This isn't coming from a perspective of someone ""poor"" btw. I come from a long line of generational wealth that has been complicit for centuries on hammering in this idea that ""life exists for us"" and that we're here to simply experience it all(if this is the case then i guess you are doing your part to distribute your wealth?).  
Yes, this is true -- the problem is, YOU, THE WEALTHY AND UNBOTHERED, are the ones setting the narrative and agenda for EVERYONE THE FUCK ELSE to live as YOU would see as ""fulfilling"" and ""meaningful"" because you think that people are just ""ungrateful"" for their mediocre lives(most people havin time to watch this movie and then writing this much about it an then complain other people should do more could probably be more productive and help).  
No. JOE GARDNER was ungrateful(was should be emphasize here ). He doesn't get to represent people who love music for music(who are you to say that?). He represents people who use music to validate their egos.  
The fact that he gets a ""second chance"" AFTER SUBMITTING HIS LIFE TO A BRATTY WHITE WOMAN IS NOT FUCKING INSPIRING(yeah bratty white women can not have had it rough).  
Do better, glitter nazis(nice way to make that word mean nothing)  
   
Someone once wrote this, “There are three ways to handle any given interaction -- you react well, you react poorly, or you don't react at all”. You can also just act. I don’t know if you think you reacted well here. But when we step out of our own personal view of what is ""right"" or ""wrong"", it really isnt about who's opinion is the ""correct"" opinion. We're muddling facts and truth with popularity and convenience, and this is the real ""evil”(like those glitter nazis).

gh5cy69,"Eh, different vibes between the two I think. ADGTH was more about Charlie learning to love something besides himself; Soul was more about Joe learning TO love himself.

gh61k4g,"I think you missed the point of the movie. Thats a very superficial comparison of two very different movies (both I really enjoyed). 
 

I wouldn't say Joe was very selfish nor flawed in the way Charlie was. Charlie's story is more about redemption.

 
Joe's story is about rediscovering the meaning of living life. It's more relatable as many of us lose ourselves as we grow older and stop enjoying the small things in life.",kkbd5s
gh84wo0,"I think both are left up to viewer's interpretation so theres no wrong answer. 

Her spark could of been anything she experienced while in Joe's body, maybe it was star gazing or walking like she said. When they look down the portal to earth she says to him ""you don't know"" but she also doesnt say what it was.

And same with the end all he says is he will live every second of it and then it ends. Maybe he did continue to live it up living his long time dream of playing professionally. Or maybe I think he could of decided to stay teaching because he realized it was more rewarding for him in the end inspiring other music lovers like Curly and Connie. The conversation with Dorothea about the fish and the ocean, I think, also shows that Joe had been searching for happiness in performing professionally believing to be his ""purpose"" but finally realize his spark is not his purpose (not what he thought he was looking for). Also the Jerry quote ""you silly humans and your 'purposes'"" pointing out Joe confusing his spark to be his purpose in life",kkbd5s
gj3c87e,"I think the point is that you don't have to feel attached. That the film starts on the day that Joe dies is a choice. His aspirations are meaningless.

Also the dude Terry accidentally dropped into the void wasn't dropped in there because he was black. Terry thought he was Joe because he was walking in the direction Terry assumed Joe was.

For reference, I’m a 30-something South Asian who does kind of like seeing representation (minorities in general, and my own ethnic group too). If this movie had, say, Kumail Nanjiani and brown characters instead of Jamie Foxx and black characters, I can’t imagine a single person from my community that would pick a bone with ‘a white woman taking over a brown man’s body’

So when they say that Soul will ""sacrifice its Black lead so a white woman can go and live out her life on Earth"" they do so knowing that the lead took that life from her in the first place and was giving it back.

What makes you think 22 has no self worth/how do you define self worth? It was clear that 22 had certain skills/attributes that Joe lacked, like being curious about other people (see Barber shop scene). Some people define their self worth by how they can relate to others, not everyone derives purpose from a hobby or their job (I do, but I have friends who pride themselves on their high EQ).

I think the main message of the movie is that you will never be satisfied in life if you solely focus on your profession and passions to the exclusion of everyone around you. Having a ""soul"" means living life in the moment and appreciating the little things that make life worth living, like the fall of a leaf onto your hand or the song of a street musician. This message is incredibly important in the age we live in: millennials are known to be singularly focused on their jobs, delaying marriage to achieve their professional goals.

This message was evident throughout the movie. In the beginning, Joe clearly is not living in the moment; he literally dies because he wasn't paying attention to his surroundings. In the Hall of You he first sees that his singular focus on piano playing has led to his isolation from others: he is eating alone, playing piano alone, and on the deathbed, alone. He believes that his piano playing can provide a spark to 22, however she's not interested just as Joe's barber is not that interested talking about jazz with him as he gets his hair cut.

People like people who can live life in the moment. Hobbies and passions are good, but pursuing them to the exclusion of others will only lead to dissatisfaction. That is the main message that soul is trying to convey and I think it does a decent, albeit messy, job at doing that.",kkbd5s

Come on, guys, stop nitpicking everything using race/gender.  Just watch the movie and enjoy it.",kkbd5s
ghld4x5,">Having Joe finally attain his goals and for that to mean absolutely nothing is just such a shitty message of the movie

I thought it was the perfect message really. People have these types of goals because they delude themselves into thinking that there's some kind of pinnacle to life and if you can reach it, everything will be alright.

The lost were a recurring theme in the movie. People who get so lost in an inward spiral around some kind of obsession that they become blinded to experiencing life in its fullness.

Having tunnel vision towards a singular goal is as much an obsession as people who blind themselves to life because they feel like they're failing at the one task or goal that matters to them.

Having Joe realise how there's no such thing as a pinnacle to life and you have to find ways to keep living a meaningful life whether you achieve your goal or not is the single most important statement this movie could make.

That's also why having 22 in the cat wouldn't have worked at all. Joe and 22 are mirrors of one another. Joe has a clear goal and he's got all of the talents and drive to obtain that goal but he hasn't learned that there's a lot more to life than this one goal. He's unhappy because he thinks his life is incomplete if he doesn't obtain this goal. To the point where he won't accept his own death.

22 has no appetite for life whatsoever and intentionally stays in a limbo where she wastes away her time. She simply doesn't understand how to appreciate life enough to actually want to live a life.

Sticking 22 in Joe's body provides her with Joe's talents and senses for an instant overwhelming appreciation of life without being blinded by Joe's tunnel vision towards his goal. Meanwhile, Joe gets the opportunity to obtain his goal and realise how meaningless it is to him in retrospect but 22's fresh perspective shows him how to move past that.

Sticking 22 in the cat would have done very little for her. While sticking Joe in his own body wouldn't have provided him with perspective.",kkbd5s
ghkyr03,"I don't think the point was that he finally achieved his dreams and it meant nothing. Throughout the movie he expressed how playing this show was going to be the start of his life and make his life meaningful and worth living. He absolutely had unrealistic expectations for what would happen when he achieved his goal and once he did, it didn't give him that feeling of completion he thought he would find there. I've definitely had experiences like this before in my own life. One of the biggest lessons from the film is that there's no such thing as waiting for your life to ""start"". Life is the sum of moments, some big, but most small. All have the power to bring us joy and fulfillment if we are open to being fully present to them. I thought it was an incredibly beautiful message.",kkbd5s

I'm not sure what you mean since 22 never went into the cat's body but there was a 2 sec  joke showing the cat soul going into the great beyond after Joe took over and when he left the cat was happy to returned to it's owner.

- Explicitly calling other people's opinions lies or ""beyond reason"" because they don't match your own, which I would categorize as quite a spiteful remark. 
- Basically all the parts you dunk on other reviewers/audiences and tell people reading your review to find other reviewers that have the same opinion as you because your opinion is apparently right. Oh also slightly dunking on IMDb too.

Basically IMDB wants your review to be about a) the movie itself and why only YOU liked/disliked it, b) comparing the movie to other movies, c) doing so without shitting on others who may have liked/disliked the movie.

Even when he doesn't mean to, Joe lobs a ball at a new soul and immediately helps them find their spark - whether he chooses to join Dorothea's band or continue teaching is up for interpretation, but they're extremely blatant about being pro-teacher, particularly pro GOOD teacher, which they establish Joe is.

I guess it works for people with a natural drive to do stuff, but it can be unhealthy magic milk for people who struggle a bit with motivation.

gh9klk8,"After coming out of seeing both Soul and Wonder Woman 1984 yesterday, and not liking the latter, I just realized something. Soul, an animated movie typically marketed for kids, is really resonating more with adults like myself instead; and likewise, WW84 really resonated with children like my nieces, even though superhero flicks are typically marketed towards teenagers and adults.

Now this isn't me saying kids won't love Soul; there's plenty of comments saying otherwise, and vice versa for adults with WW84. But there's something about how both movies are made to target different audiences.

Past all the obvious negative aspects like slow first half, over-campiness, or unimpressive action, Wonder Woman is clearly made to be as simple as possible in depth. The plot is thin, the characters wear their heart on their sleeves with little subtext, the action is cartoony and rarely brutal, etc. I tended to roll my eyes, but it was all good enough for my niece to digest, who loved it.

Soul, on the other hand, is easy enough for kids to digest, sure, but its got way more depth, more mature themes that resonates with adults who sympathize with its message of finding a spark in your life, deals with dying and all these other things kids typically don't start thinking about yet. It hit all the right notes for me, but my niece wanted to see more of the Great Before and what happened to 22.

I think that's why these movies are being received really differently. Regardless of which movie you like better, both movies are accessible to adults and children, but WW84 is made like a Disney Channel kids movie, which is catered more to kids. It's really sincere, it's sometimes cringe, cartoony and campy, straightforward, streamlined, but it's for them. Soul is made like other Pixar movies or Studio Ghibli movies, which to me are like adult movies disguised as kids movies.

Thinking like this made me dislike WW84 a little less, because it's like other certain kids movies, it just isn't for me. It's also why I've come to appreciate Pixar movies like Soul more as an adult.",kkbd5s

I'm not typically hit very hard emotionally by much of anything but I have been personally struggling with much of what the movie addresses.

I'd say I've had somewhat low grade lingering depression for years (at least partially linked to ADD that I hadn't been properly addressing until a few months ago). This year hit extra hard because of the pandemic and the fact that I was laid off several months back because of it. The hunt for my ""purpose"" has been an enormous struggle as I can't seem to find a job or career I could see myself feeling any kind of passion for.

My kids asked me why I was crying, but rather than telling them that I lost my job, I've never had purpose in life, and I don't feel like I fit in, I just simply said that the movie was saying it was enough just to enjoy life in the moment, and that I don't need a purpose to be happy. It felt like a giant weight was lifted off me.",kkbd5s
giqwsef,"If it can make you feel any better, I think the meaning goes a little more deeper and is more subtle than the way the OP puts it. By saying ""it's what makes you want to live"" I think the movie is suggesting it's the core, basic momentum that's needed in order to have life. It's not about a strict emotional drive to live, a ""willingness to live"" like the way we associate it with people who are depressed and suicidal. That's also why the movie refers to the idea of being ready to live, it just means when things are put in place (psychologically, physically) so that there can be a possibility of creating meaning. This possibility of creating meaning is what a lot of philosophers believe defines us: we are who we are because we have the ability to talk about meaning, to care about everything and anything at all. So the ""spark"" that 22 is looking for is just the right momentum to have the ability to get on Earth and understand what the world is (and she gets it by doing a leap of faith into bodily perception, by just trusting that Joe's body and the world in general is gonna work, everything falls into place and she was able to understand the concept of meaning, that's how she got her spark).

All this to say the movie isn't suggesting you have to have a purpose or you have to have at bare minimum some sort of will to live. In order to have life, to have consciousness, you need to have the ability to understand. Even in depression and any other emotional state you find yourself in, you are self-aware, you have some understanding of your situation, and that's how you're alive. And so it's okay to be struggling, it's part of how nature works.",kkbd5s
gh2rt22,Why are you depressed when you are blessed with kids when others aren’t? I’m genuinely curious,kkbd5s
gh1w6l5,"I felt like this was more realistic. He didn't actually seem to enjoy teaching that much, so while yeah he inspired some kids, it wasn't something that he was really passionate about. Teaching being the true passion all along is the kind of sappy message you would expect in a kids movie, but I like that they didn't actually go with that. I feel like the message was more, people don't actually have one true purpose in life, but life can be fulfilling anyway due to all the simple joys of it.",kkbd5s
gh1xuvf,"The point was to say that *he doesn't have a purpose and never did*. He simply does things with purpose now, wherever he ends up. Like the vet turned barber. He looks for inspiration *where he lands*.",kkbd5s
gh296j9,"I thought that thematically and conceptually, it was all very well set up.  Joe as a character has a paradoxically methodical outlook/approach to his own life for a jazz musician.  He might not be aiming for a ""traditional"" career path, but we see him several times throughout the movie laying out exactly what the next step has to be in order for him to accomplish the thing that he believes is his One True Purpose in life.  His time watching 22 live in his body and ""jazzing"" creates thematic parallels between his improvisational jazz music and his own life.  In order to do truly great things with his music, he has to get lost and live in the moment, which coincidentally happens to be the thing he also needs to do in order to lead a fulfilling life.  It's not any one activity--not professional jazz music, and not teaching--that is going to get him the most out of life.  It's an *approach.*  An improvisational approach like he takes with his jazz.  He's got to play around a little.  Find his footing, figure out the key he's in, and then just... go.

It's a challenging concept.  I think many of us, like Joe, can end up associating that ""getting lost in the moment"" feeling exclusively with specific, isolated passions without realizing that we're neglecting other things we're experiencing that are also making our lives fulfilling.  Those moments people feel like they're fulfilling their One True Purpose are so rewarding that it can be easy to forget about anything else (hence the explicit statement in the movie that the Lost Souls are not actually that different from the people in The Zone.)  We can end up tying our entire identity, self-worth, and all of our relationships to a single aspect of ourselves--a single activity that we do--which can be disastrous if that activity or our ability to perform it is ever challenged or compromised in any way.  

I thought that all of this was a much better message than a reiteration of Mr. Holand's Opus.  Trying to tie in a trite message about mentoring actually being Joe's One True Purpose would have undermined the more challenging message it was going for.",kkbd5s
gh2h423,That was part of the genius of the movie IMO. They introduced the platitude of “find your purpose” then deconstructed that trope and instead delivered the more profound message that there is no predetermined singular purpose; the spark is appreciating the different experiences that life has to offer.,kkbd5s
gh84xco,"It wasn't the line. He just started playing and got all those things out and *through his shared memory with 22* realized how much pure joy and happiness those simple things can bring. This was the spark all along. The spark that makes you experience life, at least one moment at a time. Those little things which we often forget and don't see around. 22 didn't find a purpose because she *tried to find it* and there isn't one, it wasn't about finding your place, but about shear willingness to *try it*.

It was beautiful and shown incredibly well without words in that piano sequence.",kkbd5s

gh33fon,"The lost souls were so consumed and fixated on just one thing that they stopped looking at all the reasons to be alive that they stopped living. Joe spent all his time only focusing on his ""purpose"" of being a jazz musician that he failed to connect with the people around him. Playing music is amazing but his fixation on it caused him to not be able to build strong friendships, support himself financially, be in a healthy relationship, and even created some strain in his relationship with his mother. It wasn't until he learned that his purpose isn't to just play music but to enjoy life as it is through all the improvisations that come along with it.

The biggest point they made was he got what he wanted and after the performance he was alone. This hit me in particular because I'm also a musician and experienced that very same situation. I would perform in front of a large crowd and had the time of my life only to drive home alone, have dinner alone, and not have anybody to share my experiences after. My ""purpose"" of making music and performing music didn't fulfill me. 

A lot of people focus so much on the final destination that they forget to enjoy the journey. To truly get the most out of every second of life means slowing down and enjoying the small moments. 22 gave him the opportunity to truly look around at his surroundings and be reminded that there are a lot of little things that can make life interesting and fun. She gave him an opportunity to connect with his barber friend, to be honest with his mother, to change his physical aesthetic even, and to pay attention to his students in a different way. He found a way to connect with people by being present with them. This is the same lesson I had to learn.

So he can keep pursuing his passion of making music and be damn good at it but he needs more out of life than just that. I feel like now he'll focus on not just being an amazing jazz musician but now also a good son, friend, lover, teacher, etc...",kkbd5s
gi7f75p,"*thinks* It's been a bit since seeing the movie and a lot of the inspiration it gave me has passed by a little, but essentially, it's this:

It's easy to place stock in that your life has a very specific purpose for bring. Problem is, when you feel like you can't find your purpose, or reach it, or just simply enjoy it, it can feel like you're wasting your life. Or, like Joe, you push for that dream, that goal, and you get there and there's no big movie climax. Everything - and you - is just the same as before. So it can feel really...disappointing.

Whereas the 'spark' they're talking about is more - what is it about living that you simply enjoy for it's own sake? Can you look at the thing you love doing and just...be happy that you're doing it, rather than pushing it to some greater and grander purpose and risking burnout? 

I think this is why it's important the movie doesn't give the answer of 'what does he choose - the music career, or his steady teaching? It's not important. He's learned that music gives his life meaning - not that his life's meaning has to be music. 

Sorry to hear you're in crisis, and I hope this helps. It's definitely been a movie that took me some time to process.",kkbd5s
gh1yvgx,"I think it's fine, the main conflict was about one character trapped in a purpose and one that couldn't find one. Propose was never the point.

It's all just a matter of what you choose to focus on, I love that he didn't get a girlfriend or anything at the end of the movie, because that isn't neccesary, it's not about the end goal or about checking any boxes it's about enjoying whatever comes your way, journey before destination.",kkbd5s

I like to think that he'll learn from his time as a mentor, and apply it to his job as a music teacher, he'll keep teaching, whether it's part-time or full-time, but now he'll enjoy it more and he'll appreciate how he gets to be a mentor to all those kids.   

Plus, when he dies he'll get another chance of being a mentor to new souls.",kkbd5s

gh8io1d,"Same here, and completely agree. DC doesn't know what they're doing.",kkbd5s
gh2vcpn,"ww84 felt rush, plot is all over the place and there were tons of one-tone characters. Also something about blasting how every guy is horny, can't control themselves for some reason, who constantly hit on females just annoyed the shit out of me. Like really? just bad writing all around.",kkbd5s
ghkz7n4,"It was awful IMO and I always give superhero movies a big pass for being cheesy. But this was on another level. I’m actually surprised so many people thought it was decent, when the acting, dialogue, story, and pacing was all shit. Plus, were barely any scenes of Wonder Woman actually being Wonder Woman. Sorry if I sound like I’m ranting, but I feel like I’m taking crazy pills. Everyone is acting like it’s a mediocre movie, when it’s one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen.",kkbd5s

gh1quyy,"i didnt cry like i did in Coco or Onward[very lightly teared up], but its genuinely such a great scene. This whole movie is just such a damn delight and a gutpunch at the same time",kkbd5s
gh1qe50,"It's very good imagery, but I couldn't help but find it a little funny. The idea of placing the items out where the sheet music would go as if they're where he's reading the music from is great imagery, but the fact that he thought to literally do that in that moment made me chuckle.

gh1v74s,Great movie. Last Friday still happened though. Nothing is topping that in 2020.,kkbd5s
ghva2j2,"It seriously did!

I was thinking about going to therapy because of this exact thing. That scene where he and 22 see moments of his life that are seemingly dull hit so much home, and I was in tears watching it because I could relate so much to the feeling of having ""wasted"" your life because you haven't done anything ""meaningful"". And I was a bit anxious to see how this would get resolved and if I could apply it to my life.

And then came the actual message of the movie... I had actually had thoughts like this every now and then and it made me feel so happy and content. But my worries always started suppressed these thoughts and I started to think that this can't be it and that I probably am still wasting my life compared to what other people around me accomplish.

Seeing that message play out in the movie like that, a movie that is this big, really did something to me. I'll definitely put some serious effort into keeping to think like this because I always want to feel the way I did after finishing this movie.",kkbd5s
gh1wpe4,"Funny you say that, because I think this movie basically cements why I hated that movie so much: the impact of those little moments. Like, when you break it down, all the things that 22 experiences are awesome, like catching a helicopter seed, eating pizza, and getting *free candy*. 22 really sells that euphoria of experiencing something aesthetically pleasing for the first time, which helps us with empathizing with their emotional journey. Meanwhile in Boyhood, the main kid just zombie walks his way through an abusive household, his mom trying to finish her degree, and going through a high school relationship. Even if it’s trying to be grounded, you’d think a kid like that would actually express how that stuff makes him feel, y’know? It definitely helps that Tina Fey is a much better actor, and animation helps make stuff like reactions “pop” compared to real life, but still.",kkbd5s

While he's in the zone he has an epiphany: that he had already lived life, all of its little moments, and that it was beautiful. But 22 hadn't had that opportunity for herself, and because she gave up her badge, she would never be able to. In effect, Joe had taken her life so that she could keep living his own. And that doesn't feel right to him. So he decides to give it back.

Throughout all of this, Joe is still very much alive, even though his soul had left his body. Only once he passed ""through the light"" into the Great Beyond would he have died.",kkbd5s

And how is a monogamous universe appropriate? The film takes place in New York not some African city, expecting him to only interact with black people and call it shitty that he doesn't makes no sense. It's not the same thing as Coco, because it was about a Mexican in Mexico, not a Mexican born in America, living in New York.

Plus Coco was specifically about a holiday related to that culture. It doesn't mean that every time Pixar makes a movie staring someone who isn't white the film needs to be something like that. I feel like it would give the wrong impression if the film with the black guy *had* to be about Kwanzaa or something.

And 22 is literally an unborn soul, she literally has no race.

>(Side note : ""Representation matters"" isn't for white kids, that came off weird)

In the sense that it's not the same issue of minorities struggling to find positive characters that look like them, but I feel like saying an absolute like that denies another angle, in which how positive representation of a certain ethnic group is beneficial to everyone, including people outside of said group.

Some of it is likely magnified by my own worries and expectations, just like 22’s inner thoughts when they became a lost soul, but those feelings are valid. 22 wasn’t wrong for internalizing everything the way they did, they don’t need to always live the way everyone else says they need to.

I think soul was a fantastic movie, but i agree, accepting death would've been the better option. 

But the thing that bugs me is that it doesn't have a clear cut beginning middle and end.  Maybe it's because of the open ending i don't  know. Perhaps it would've been better if this was an animated series as there is so much to explore/explain.

Inside out still remains the fav movie for me.

I felt like it was so poetic and beautiful, he helped a lost soul that has been wandering for centuries to finally find its will to live, and just as that soul is born he accepts his fate and goes to the great beyond.

And him returning to earth is itself a beautiful message: every one of us watching the movie can start a new perspective. It’s never too late to appreciate.",kkbd5s
gh1n22b,"Nah. There’s an entire subplot related to the Jerry’s disdain for Terry that’s left without a proper resolution without Joe getting to go back. It’s very clearly being setup early on.

I'd be curious for you to elaborate on what you hoped they would've achieved this way because I can't imagine there being much of a story to tell if they did. It's the story of an ""average"" human character and his ""average"" human life, and 22, as the other main character, finds no motivation in the realm she lives in. His life on earth and her experience of it from his perspective is what propels the story.

>  infants die everyday but he gets another chance because he ""inspired"" them

I uh-...dunno about this comparison lol...I can understand the ending feeling like a cop-out but the way I see it, The whole thing is supposed represent a ""near-death experience"".

It may be that sleeping bodies are soulless and could be taken over - but why show it on the escalator then? Just like they showed the zone and lost souls being out of the body, they could have shown a dream world and put the cat there until his body was available again.",kkbd5s

gimpj7r,"So I didn't read anything about the movie, but my wife had.  We discussed it after watching.  She said the big criticism is that ""Disney doesn't really have a full movie with a black lead.""  In Soul, the main character is black, but he spends more than half the movie outside of a black body.  The other major Disney movie with a black lead is ""The Princess and the Frog"", which does the exact same thing.  Then it's made worse by the fact when he is in his black body, he's voiced by a middle aged white woman and the black voice lead is in a cat.  I didn't notice it, but I can definitely see how somebody who feels like they're never represented in Disney films would immediately see it.",kkbd5s

gh4pz00,"You know...I've enjoyed Reznor and Ross' stuff for a while now, and only just now also realized their background. Who would've thought?!",kkbd5s
ghdk9km,"Yeah, I think was still able to tell a very valuable message. But I think it's a message that would only be strengthened by also including a frank confrontation with death. There are so many life lessons that can be drawn from death, and this movie's set up put it in a unique position to really tackle these lessons.

In fact, the more I think about it, I'm not sure why Joe needed to die to tell this story. It seems like with the way death is treated in *Soul*, you could swap out death with just about any unfortunate setback (losing employment, a failing relationship, etc.) followed by a worldly adventure to find one's self, and you could have just about the same story with just about the same message. But death isn't like any other setback, you know? It's this constant inevitable reality hanging over every single one of us. A loss of everything we ever had, loved, or dreamed. And in avoiding that, I feel the movie failed to live up to its full potential.",kkbd5s
ghhgfy1,its not a copout. Death wouldn't serve the purpose of the movie. And being ready for death was not part of the message.,kkbd5s

ghc0aka,"> I feel like I’ve seen that before but examples are escaping me

They really reminded me of Janet from the Good Place!",kkbd5s
gheqfoz,"Sure. But I meant it more in a ""You only get one chance at life"" type thing. Giving Joe that second chance at the end kind of lessens the impact the movie had on me. Having Joe come to terms with it *and* actually die, fully understanding that while he may not get a second chance to fulfill his own dream or live life again he's at least the reason someone (22) will live life in the way he wishes he had and that someone else (Connie) might achieve hers - and in a way, that's how he lives on instead - would've been more poignant to me.

I'm obviously not a writer, and I'm absolutely not saying my idea is better or anything (Hell, at the very least it'd need a heck of a lot of workshopping), just that it would've resonated with *me* more if something to that effect had happened.",kkbd5s
ghgac98,"I think they meant the next Dalai Lama, this would kind of fit a sould with so many mentors.",kkbd5s
ghdag2w,No it didn't,kkbd5s
gh3fm62,"From what I understand, it's just VERY common for souls to find joy from an interest, hence the misconception that it's a purpose/something that can be ""done"". But it doesn't *have* to be. The barber scene was kind of explaining this: he wanted to become a vet, but circumstances forced him to become a barber. However he still found joy in the interactions with customers and it fulfilled his ""spark"" for life, which is why he was happy to keep being a barber.

Perhaps this is their interpretation of how passions and hobbies come to be? Like there are things we love to *do*, and sometimes that becomes our profession, but sometimes it's just something we get to do on the side to relax and enjoy. (They also show what happens when that thing we ""do"" becomes an unhealthy tether). But it's not our purpose ""for"" life. *LIFE itself* is the purpose for life, which is something 22 couldn't experience, or understand, until she actually got a chance to live it. (The limit of the You Seminar is that they get to ""try"" the things but not ""live"" it - like they can ""eat"" but not ""experience eating"")

Same with Joe's realization after playing the 1st show - he didn't feel any different because playing that show isn't his purpose for life, but music just helps him express it. The ocean/water analogy illustrates this too: what he'd been looking for was his reason for ""living"" but because he was so focused on achieving this one concept (the ""idea"" of an ocean, or for him jazz) he wasn't really living life, which was why he felt his life hadn't amounted to anything.

That being said, it'd be interesting to see what ""Joe"" was like as a soul-lette lol",kkbd5s

I didn't think the movie was a complete failure at what it was, but some decisions story wise just made everything too simple, and they didn't even rush everything to make it that way. The one thing they had to do was change the ending, instead of making it so rushed and climatic, they could've explored other decisions, this time focusing on Joel instead of 22.",kkbd5s

Joe's body was still onscreen the entire time he was in the cat, and his personality was still onscreen the entire time through the cat.  He was still there as a complete character--it's just that his body and soul were mismatched.  I don't think it belongs in the same category as the others where they were essentially removing a nonwhite character from the movie and replacing them with an animal.",kkbd5s
gh5n6ub,"I am just curious...I have heard this criticism about black leads being changed into frogs and birds and souls and such, and as a white guy I'm genuinely curious when I ask:  Does this make you view the characters as less black?  I don't want this to come off as snarky or whatever, but I am genuinely curious about how people feel about this.  I was always under the impression that belonging to any ethnicity carried with it a culture that went beyond just appearance.  I guess what I am saying is:  I'm not sure I see how Tiana being a frog downplays who she is as a black woman.  Her growing up in a black neighborhood cooking for her neighbors shaped who she was as a person and, I don't know, does that go away just because her physical appearance has changed?  The same with Soul, he is introduced to jazz by his father because as his father puts it (paraphrasing of course) jazz was an important contribution to music from the black community.  That legacy profoundly shaped who Joe was and was central to his character and doesn't go away just because he doesn't look like a black man.

Teaching was just one aspect of Joe's life--there were moments he truly enjoyed that we get in his flashbacks (his mentoring of Curly made it into the fulfilling experiences montage), but the flashback sequence of all the most fulfilling moments of his life was full of lots of different things.  No one thing was his spark or his special purpose.  The message was that fulfillment comes from lots of different things.",kkbd5s

Good Dinosaur, Onward, Brave, Cars 2, Finding Dory, Toy Story 4 are all either mediocre, boring, or just plain awful.

ghdk27g,"I understand that’s really all the message is but the execution seems quite poor. 

He would still have felt the same apathetic way after playing the gig that evening which renders his whole journey during the after/before life pointless to the story.

I guess what I don’t connect here is how his journey with 22 changed his perspective at all. Especially during the flashbacks with his father, mother, and eating cake in the cafe. He was happy. He just forgot. If the message was “don’t forget to appreciate the things you already have” then O could get behind it. But I feel “don’t forget you’re already happy” packs less of a punch. 

I think the problem is he wasn’t really having a bad life before the gig. He enjoyed sharing jazz with his students. He enjoyed visiting his mum and her friends (despite her efforts of stopping him becoming a performer), he enjoyed good food in New York (cafes, pizza). 

While we’re on the mum topic. Are we supposed to just realise mum was right all along and to not chase dreams? Its just so many mixed messages that didn’t quite hit properly.",kkbd5s

Having said that, I would be interested to see how Pixar might someday tackle less American-centric stories. After taking on a black American and a Mexican kid as two of their latest protagonists, it seems Pixar is testing the waters. And importantly, both Soul and Coco turned out to be two of Pixar's best storytelling achievements to date. I see this as proof that ""increasing diversity"" can actually be a creative boon rather than a generic box for the casting department to check (looking at you, Lucasfilm). 

Given Disney's global aspirations, I think it's all but guaranteed that we'll be getting broader perspectives in the years to come.

It seemed like the movie was going for this message since 22 was scared of living but ended up wanting to live; Joe was scared of dying but seemed to realize he should have looked around him throughout his life/enjoy life for what it is and enjoyed being a mentor to 22 (which is one of the job’s for souls after their human has died).

Then they send a bunch of fresh souls off to become aloof, an undesirable trait. Jerry laughs at the ideas we are born with a personality. We are in fact engineered.

He learns to find happiness and purpose in things other than jazz, but jazz is still a major source of those things as well. his conversation with the barber (can’t remember his name) is really telling, where the barber tells him that he actually wanted to be something entirely different but stumbled into cutting hair and fell in love with it and found purpose. The camera cuts to joe (as the cat) seeming to understand something he never thought of before. Maybe someone can have more than one purpose. 

This is then hit home when joe and 22 leave the barber shop and 22 asks “why didn’t you tell me that stuff about wanting to be a doctor? before?” And the barber responds “you never asked. But today, I’m glad you did.” 

This shows that joe has always just assumed the barber was born to cut hair and that was his reason for living. Today, joe finds out that maybe someone can find more than one reason for living, or even a new reason for living.

gh8powp,"Inside out had a lot of good ideas but it could have gone so much deeper. But since it was about a 12 year old who is traumatized by a major move, I feel there was a lot of potential it didnt delve into. It was a nice surface level story about how emotions interact and that it's ok to he sad. Which considering the prevalence of toxic positivity is a good message. But I saw it as a college kid who never went through such a big move, and she ran away in the movie for 2-4 hours. It just wasnt super relatable. I did like the abstract art scene. 

Soul was about how the things you want wont necessarily make you happy and trying to figure out your purpose and had more abstract art. Also I'm pretty sure the textures on the emotions in inside out was the grass in the great before. Anyway soul just felt more universally relatable to me. Joe is an adult who is trying hard to follow his dreams and gets a taste to define it doesnt fully fill all those life purpose needs. Its bittersweet. 

Inside out was great, also a bittersweet movie. I just feel I wasnt the target audience for it. Joe has zero heads up and has to deal with his dreams slipping through his grasp. Admittedly soul also could have gone a lot deeper in bits. I liked 22 a lot more than joe and would love to see 22 more on their own talking about the big picture of life. 

Also it's kinda hard to rank certain pixar movies. There are the universal greats and then there are cars 2 and the good dinosaur.

Joe wasn’t dedicated to the wrong passion, but had the wrong idea about the nature of passions themselves.

That message is much more unique and impactful than any similar movie I can recall.",kkbd5s

In a sense, Joe is reborn at the end, and the audience is now left with the question of ""how can we make the most of the time we're given?"".

Also, I don't see Terry as a villain, and I don't think the film paints the character that way. Terry is just a being that has a very specific purpose that interrupts the protagonists' arc. But there's nothing villanous or malicious about any of Terry's actions in my opinion.",kkbd5s

For 1, Terry says there hasn't been an incorrect tally for centuries.  Given that and how calm or zoned out everyone else on the treadmill was, there has to be something different about Joe for him to be freaking out.

For 2 and 4, maybe the Zone/lost soul land is not specifically part of the Great Before, but it is fundamentally a soul place.  In the rest of the metaphysical realm, souls can be not yet born, actively dying, or physically falling to Earth.  Adding this place where your soul is in Limbo and can access other realms with attendant effects on your body makes their rules way more complicated than they need to be.

3, 5 and 6 are less of a concern to handwave, but they add to an overall sloppiness in their system.  

Compare to the emotional peak of Inside Out: Bing Bong is doomed because he is stuck in the Memory Dump.  The rules are very simple and inescapable, and the scene is effective.  Imagine if only Bing Bong's head had fallen into the Memory Hole and his body was comically flailing around in Long Term Memory searching for it.  Now what happens in that scene?  There are so many more loose ends to tie up that don't help deliver the emotional payload.

Just cut that side of the movie to the bone, and add more of Joe on Earth.  Ideally, showing us how much he needs the growth he achieves in the movie.",kkbd5s

gh1qrmb,"Yes, I know that’s what the movie said. I’m saying that it felt like they were building up toward a much more nuanced “purpose isn’t one dimensional or prescribed - it’s something you make and give yourself, and it’s not always a straight path.” It felt like they put in a *lot* of work to show how Joe’s teaching has positively effected a lot of people around him. It was strange and jarring to me, then, that that was abandoned for the much simpler, and frankly, much more out of left field “just enjoy the little things, that’s what matters.” I mean, that was a *great* direction for 22 to go in - it was the little things that slowly chipped away at her pessimism and skepticism. But I feel Joe was unceremoniously shoehorned into that same box when there was the opportunity to do something a lot more satisfying, natural, and sacrificial (Joe’s second chance renders his sacrifice to allow 22 to live her life utterly meaningless).",kkbd5s
gh1q0wn,"I understand that it goes against the theme displayed in the end. What I’m saying is that, rather than the whole “just enjoy life” angle, it seemed like they were driving toward something more akin to “your spark isn’t your purpose, it’s what helps you make your own purpose” or something along those lines. Which, again, I understand isn’t the direction they went in in the last 20 minutes, but it fell flat for me compared to what it seemed like they were spending a *lot* of time on.

And yes, Joe was lost in life - show us *more* of that. I understand that he didn’t really know himself, but we as the audience could have used another five or ten minutes *seeing* him live that aimless, lost life before he falls through the manhole. We don’t need a deep dive - show us some more of him teaching, maybe some of the mundanity we saw *after the fact* in his museum exhibit in the Soul World.

Also, really, Joe was gung-ho about his purpose in life up until the first show with the band ended. It was more of an all at once moment than anything gradual. He saw 22 enjoy the little things. But that didn’t once effect his behavior or decision making.",kkbd5s
gh1vnw6,">	For example: They reference a “Lisa” a few times (presumably a romantic interest) yet we never see or hear from her.

This is a complaint for you but an absolute highlight for me. It’s a real example of economy storytelling *Her name is Lisa, and she’s the only woman that 22 brings up. What more do we need to know?* Seriously, what more does one absolutely need to know about Lisa? She’s somebody from Joe’s past. An old flame, or some potential option that he never took, or somebody that was always unavailable for whatever reason, all of these potential histories go unspoken but it doesn’t matter. 

It doesn’t matter because most everybody has a “Lisa” of their life, [the one that got away](https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/the-one-that-got-away.398959/) that certain somebody that you’ll think of on your death bed. Some people manage to not have one, because they met and stayed with the love of their life or whatever, but for so many of us, there is that someone that carries a great deal of weight. Lisa was that someone for our hero. 


Any further details or exploration of her is completely unnecessary and only muddles the story. What, do we need a five minute side story on how Lisa and Joe always clicked and Lisa always made herself available to spend time with him but he was always getting his practicing hours in so she was left frustrated and then Lisa moved on to somebody else and by the time Joe realized what he was missing, she was gone? That, or some other tragic mundane thing happened. We don’t need to explore it, it isn’t relevant to the story. Use your imagination!!!",kkbd5s

We spent so little time with Joe before he fell down the manhole cover, not enough time for *me* to be at all invested in the character, and then on top of that, *nobody else who had died seemed to think it was a bad thing.* There were *dozens* of people on that treadmill to the great beyond, and not *one* of them was upset they’d died, except Joe. So A) the pacing was off kilter for me as far as giving me enough time to be invested in Joe’s character before he died (kinda), and B) death is immediately characterized by everyone else we see facing it, in the soul world, as not at all a big deal. We only care because Joe keeps yelling that it’s bad, but we weren’t *shown* that. We were shown the opposite pretty immediately, in fact.

Huuuuuuge leap to call me heartless for feeling like the pacing wasn’t great and so I wasn’t invested in Joe’s death (again, *sort of*).

The real story was that Joe was so caught up in his idea of where he should be that he wasn't living in the moment and he wasn't connecting with those around him.

I don't think the movie is about being happy either. I think the movie is about appreciating and showing gratitude for the little things. Joe can appreciate his impact on his students but was so caught up on his view of what it means to be successful. Joe was caught up in trying to be a professional musician that he wasn't taking care of his own finances and put that burden on his mom.

Definitely felt abrupt with how he got his 2nd chance literally right after accepting his end. On top of that, him getting a second chance because he inspired the Jerrys seemed way too easy and nothing was really written in a way to set that up. Sure those beings seemed all powerful so it makes sense, but it felt like they just went with the easiest way of getting him a 2nd chance instead of writing something better.

gh8r80v,"I'm happy to elaborate. I agree, many hard workers in the movie. But hard work and its rewards are never shown in a flattering light, and you could even argue that the central message discourages working hard.


Joe is the best example. He has dedicated his life to music and feels he was born to be a musician; he doesn't feel like he has made it yet, but he's inspired to make sacrifices until he does.  What does that get him? When he dies, the replay of his life makes him think he was a loser, and worse, makes us as the audience think the same thing. When he achieves success in his performance, he doesn't get a rush of satisfaction, but rather a feeling of emptiness. In the before world, he learns that he wasn't born to be a musician, that we're all just born to enjoy life. In the end neither his dedication to music or success as an inspiring teacher are presented as reasons for living... just living is supposed to be enough.



Other lesser examples of the same theme include the film's nearly equating ""being in the zone"" with being a lost soul; Terry's being a subject of ridicule for fastidiously doing his job; his mom being sure to point out that his dad's dedication to music came at the cost of his family's financial stability. These are all nitpicky and alone wouldn't mean much, but together I think they strengthen my point. 



This is just one interpretation of the movie, but I think it's a valid one. I don't know if it was intentional, but there is definitely a cynical anti-ambitiousness undercurrent in the movie.



I was also frustrated feeling like there were other messages they could have presented more strongly. There was sooo much opportunity for them to show Joe discovering satisfaction with being an inspiring teacher... it actually bothered me that with both trombone girl and the drummer dude we never really see Joe have that epiphany. Similarly, when he's doesn't get the satisfaction he expects after his big gig, we never get a lesson about how the process is more important than the end result.


I actually think that the writers probably did want to explore and emphasize those messages (finding what you love, enjoying the pursuit more than the ends), and others, but probably had to sacrifice them to make a more focused movie. I think making the central theme ""enjoy the everyday and live in the moment"" weakened the movie, and (maybe inadvertently) sent a message that hard work and dedication doesn't pay off. They may have ditched him finding satisfaction with being a teacher as the central message since it was probably too predictable.


Thanks for indulging my take.",kkbd5s

Agreed. I teared up during certain moments my first time watching Coco. In Coco, you have actual death that characters don’t come back from. The great grandmother dies at the end and you see the main character (can’t remember his name), telling his baby sister about her. That’s how death and grief really are for many of us. We lose a loved one, but they still live on in a way through our memories. 

In Soul, Joe dies and then spends the majority of the movie refusing to accept it. And then in the end he gets a second chance anyway. That was the most disappointing aspect of the movie for me. I work in hospice, so acceptance of death is a theme that I’m familiar with and would fully get behind in a movie. The way that Soul avoided that just felt cheap to me.

gh1sd56,"Tbf, and i do agree that not knowing what he chooses to do is the right way to do it, he did seem to enjoy teaching just fine until it became a permanent thing. Like he had to have been doing it a while, of one of his students is old enough to be in a jazz band",kkbd5s
gh1zdpm,"He disliked teaching  ause he saw it as a lesser work and not his true calling. He realisee later on that jazz playing is also ""just a job"" since ot revealed nothing and he had to do it everyday like a job.

It’s just that so many of my friends that I grew up with, smart and talented and passionate about things, all work at hedge funds or in private equity now, so much talent burned in the pursuit of the almighty dollar, and I feel like the world would be better served if more people pursued their passions than the other way around.",kkbd5s
ghg276a,"Where in the film does it show that Joe is missing out on life? I feel like we're constantly told this but rarely shown. Where are we shown the costs to Joe's lifestyle at the beginning of the film? He has a strained relationship with his mother but that's solely because of his choice of career not any sense that he's missing out on life's little moments or something. He loves jazz and wants that to be his career so why does the film make out as if it's a bad thing to have drive and ambition? And it doesn't make sense to compare him to the stock trader because Joe genuinely has passion.

I feel like the message of the film is very muddled and it ends with a milquetoast sappy moral of 'it's the little things that count' which is as banal as it gets.",kkbd5s
gh3dzuh,"The message isn't clear, you can't just tell people to remember to live life. When they're in a situation that they can't even enjoy anything anymore. We're all fighting a battle that no one can see. Just loving life isn't going to pay the bills, loving life isn't going to put food in your stomach, loving life isn't going to help others that you want to help. This world revolves around one thing that I hate. But its the truth. And its money. Without money, you literally cannot do anything. Literally look at how our government is ""helping"" american people with only $600 in stimulus. While giving other countries billions upon billions of dollars. We have people here that have lost their jobs for 9 months, who don't know how to pay bills, feed their family, get sick from covid. 

This movies message is sloppy, I get the feeling that its just a big ""think positive"" message. But thats just disregarding the situation of that specific person. Obviously if people just ""thought positive"" we wouldn't have the largest percentage of depressed people, and the highest rate of suicide either. 

I loved the message more in inside out, telling people that it's okay to be sad. Nothing is always good. And being vulnerable is normal. 

This movie is just sloppy,",kkbd5s
gh47wbf,"Exactly! The message in the movie is just sloppy. She can love life, but just living isn't going to give you food, just living isn't going to put a roof over your head, I just felt like this is a idealization of a perfect life. Which sucks.

ghhpqs0,"THAT PART of the film rang true... everyone has experience that sort of surprising dissatisfaction after accomplishing a goal you thought you wanted. But that isn't really the main issue the film was attempting to address. It fails to really present a realistic alternative to the question of 'what now then'. Its solution after the main characters lose their initial passion IS basically 'enjoy the little things'... hey spinny leaves are neat right? Pizza taste good right?

To someone who is actually trying to come to terms with true cosmic, existential dread about the meaninglessness of existence... that part of the film ultimately comes off as very shallow and pandering.",kkbd5s
ghhqtgp,"The problem with that is, even using the film's own logic, there are people who are inherently NOT satisfied with such a lifestyle. The film presents people's personalities as predetermined (a concept which is totally incorrect in reality) which would mean that there is nothing that some people can do about the fact that they aren't satisfied with 'just the simple things'.",kkbd5s
ghhq1nv,"The film is what missed the meat of that argument. Yes, they were approaching the idea of 'helping others' being a better activity for some. But, they just kind of end it there when there's a hell of a lot more to that that should have been touched on. He feels unsatisfied after accomplishing his musical goal and so the film insinuates that he really should have been satisfied as a teacher... but what happens when you accomplish THAT goal and feel the same dissatisfaction? What happens when you help 1000 children and realize the world is still a dysfunctional mess and you didn't make even a tiny dent? Eat more pizza?

The passion works well, but as a plot device to limit how much time the characters have, it’s kind of unsatisfying. It works as a way to show how happiness in life doesn’t come from some predetermined purpose, but trying to invest myself in his goal, only for it to be not that big a deal after all; kind of devalues everything they went through to get there. 

I still think it can work better with more focus on 22.",kkbd5s
ghk16l6,"I definitely do, and I try taking that into account. 22 was afraid of never finding a spark and felt like it could only be found on earth in a body. That’s a fear I’d never get. On the other hand... taking out your fears on others in horrible ways, thousands of times",kkbd5s

I’m a 22 for sure; feeling like nothing sparks me really, being scared into inaction, too caught up in my own head, etc., while she’s definitely a Joe; focused and ambitious, but often tunnel visioned because of that and not appreciative of the smaller moments in life in pursuit of the bigger picture.",kkbd5s

gtkqc8o,"People hate cancel culture and race conversation because it's uncomfortable and hard to relate from everyone's siloed POVs. 

People like me who call out fake ""woke"" culture then get flack for it because just like taking medicine that doesn't taste good, no one wants to take it.

This movie tried to claim itself to be part of a ""representation matters"" movement when the main character isn't even in his own body for majority of the movie. This also happened in princess of the frog when tiana, a black woman - as strong of a protagonist as she was - was still a frog for majority of the movie.

Outside of black culture, even in Asian culture, they still didn't get it right. They turned Mulan into a Jedi, not a normal girl who learned through her own wit and determination.. They just made her a superhero.

What's the message behind that? Just like Rey all of a sudden being related to Palpatine.... Because from someone who isn't white or wealthy, it sure looks like the new modern message is that the true heroes of this world dont earn shit, they just are they way they are because they come from families or generations that have harbored wealth or knowledge long enough to just wake up badass.

Tiana had help from her rich white friend. Joe Gardner gets help from a timeless soul who had all the greatest teachers of history. Mulan and Rey are ""born"" with it. Disney has not done SHIT to ""correct"" any of its racist history. Its not genuine, and they're only superficially pandering to audiences of color BECAUSE of this ""cancel culture."" 

What's annoying is the fake woke people are actually buying into this shit thinking Disney is being ""progressive"" but they're not.

It's still the same shit, prettier package.

I know it's super uncomfortable to think that the happy mouse ears aren't so innocent, but the message is clear: the rich and powerful are who give you the opportunity to reach your goals either by gifting it to you (for your obedience and submission) or by birthing you into royalty, or some high caste system that embues you with the sense of ""obligation"" because of your ranking.

Anna gets to save the poor black guard stuck in the enchanted forest and Elsa becomes basically a god (there goes that good ol' white hero complex) but Joe Gardner gets to become a cat/metaphysical buddy for a bratty soul, and Tiana gets to be a green swamp guide for a bratty prince.

So... Black people are just story vehicles for immature characters that need a touch of the ""black struggle"" to become better beings?

...weird, if I was writing a story about representation and black culture, I wouldn't be placing anyone else's narratives in the story other than theirs. That barber shop scene wasn't ""sweet"" or ""deep"" to me.

To me, it showed how little Joe knew how to connect with his own community, and until 22 came in, and brought a ""deeper meaning"" to their conversations, they didn't embrace Joe the way they did in that scene.

Sorry, but perhaps this discussion thread just hasn't been confronted with enough real life blatant racism, but to me, that scene was another display of the white savior complex where it took an educated white person to connect with ""the people"" to the point where people are enamored by 22's other worldly knowledge, and then shift to give Joe respect he didnt have before, since the implication is that he's just so in his head about his own shit that he never tried to connect to his own people.

All Disney did in this movie was prove they have evolved past drawing blackface now and actually took the time out to study black facial features and expressions accurately... Which only begs the question... Why now do you all of a sudden know how to capture the correct details? What, somehow in the past 60 years, the animation team was suddenly like ""OHH!! THATS WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE!""

Yeah, not buying it. They're racist fucks, and they count on their branding, merchandising, entertainment, and media influence to distract people like you into believing its all ""meta humor.""

I don't want to ""cancel"" anything, but until Americans are willing to see thay they are NOT the ""default"" of people and do NOT represent people globally, the race conversation needs to continue to happen, cause clearly, American companies still aren't getting it. These statements support power and elitism, not inclusion and progressive action.

I would much rather these movies come out with the blatant message that they will never give a fuck about poor people than this lie they keep feeding us that this ""struggle"" is what ""builds character.""

Did you give a shit enough to reach down to the bottom of this post? If you did, are you now out of spite, going to downvote this because I brought up something that you either can't or don't agree with and it made you feel some sort of way?

Weird. I'm not the one ""canceling"" YOUR voice out, am I?

But keep projecting that I'm promoting ""cancel culture"" by calling out shit you don't want to deal with. I dont want them to ""take down"" their movies or cancel Eminem or any of that other dumb shit. 

Do not confuse my frustration with the likes of bored children who want to feel for feels sake. Perhaps there are people in the world who have worked in or for these toxic environments, such as animation companies, financial industries, and the like, and have firsthand knowledge to the dirty and ugly truths of these industries.

gzkf7s4,"Your interjections were a bit hard to track and read since I also used parantheses and quotes, so I'm not sure I caught everything you replied to. Also, the assumption that someone can have time to watch a movie, ponder it, and write a review as someone who could be ""more productive with their time"" is a subjective point of view because everyone manages their time differently. Productivity doesn't equal the inability to do things others consider a ""leisure activity.""

I can appreciate the questioning of if my callouts imply that I am doing the things that I'm complaining others don't do, because, yes, I do live and operate at the standard that I am stating the rest of humanity can get to, but more than often doesn't.

Granted, internet culture and the majority of the reddit population would probably fall into this category of bitching about social injustices by throwing a hashtag on their social media wall.

I don't need to validate the hours I clock to support the communities and causes I am a part of, and I can still respond at this length to you without sacrificing much of my time doing so. I have an hour break between my next commitment, and this only takes a few minutes away from that hour.

To me, that's well worth the time to purge thoughts that no, were NOT ""good"" reactions -- they were raw, human reactions that come at a prose and diatribe most people don't recognize because of the level of sight and experience I'm speaking from. That isnt age specific -- anyone from any age can have a perspective that shines a new light or alternate thinking path to consider, so I'm not exclusive to my thoughts or my opinions. They are on a platform like this for exactly responses like yours that took the time to question and challenge things that either you maybe didn't agree with, or couldn't fully see from my perspective.

This is what civil discourse looks like. You don't have to agree with me -- and I don't have to be offended that you don't agree.

Your quote is a great quote and I agree with its sentiment as far as the three ways to handle anything, however to your statement ""you can just act"" is a bit redundant, since every action after another action IS a REaction unless there is no action at all, so unless you are initiating the act, every action is a reaction.

No I did not react to the movie well, and I shared that. Are you saying that all negative reactions define someone's total character? And if so, do you never have negative reactions?

What are we trying to associate here? That those who aren't happy about their experiences shouldn't share them and should only share things they reacted to well? Where would we be able to learn or advance past our current understanding then?

Or, on the third option -- should we never react to anything at all?

I don't think that's what you were saying, so it brings me to question... what exactly was your point in your response...?

I don't think there was anywhere that I placed in this comment that I'm a ""non-reactor"" so I'm a bit confused with whatever this response ""makes me"" in your eyes, but if it helps you identify responses like mine as a categorized personality, then I hope this gave you whatever deeper perspective you needed to further ""assess"" my reddit thread.

(Which again was foreshadowing you could come back from being a lost soul earlier in the film), but it's some serious mental health imitations for 22. Fortunately it wasn't as serious as it often is in real life. 

It just seemed the real adult thing to do, would have been learning the lesson along the way(which Joe seemed to understand) and then making the adult choice to not act selfishly and childish at the end.

Because evolution dictates what personality traits get passed down and we share a lot of personality traits with family members since personality is mostly genetic. So in the movies universe, in order to also be aligned with evolution theory, if you have a certain personality then is your soul assigned to physical bodies that will carry those same traits due to evolution?

He encourages the girl at the beginning for going solo Lisa Simpson style. He's clearly shown to be passionate about jazz especially with his 'in the zone' scene. How can that be characterised as a bad thing?

And what specifically is Joe doing wrong at the beginning of the film? His mum is unhappy because of his choice of career not because he's not 'living in the moment'. And the scene of him looking back at his life is pretty manipulative; the film could have shown the joyful moments of his life that we see near the end of the film with his epiphany but instead we are shown the mundane moments which literally every person has no matter how fulfilled they are.

ghkz8lf,"But life isn't just one thing, it's a lot of chapters and changes. The movie oversimplified living to an insane degree to the extent that it just ruins the movie. It makes absolutely no sense for the character to suddenly just be like, ""That's it?"" after the first gig as well, he'd know full well he'd be playing every night and, while it's a job, it's also something he'd love doing. That's why the movie loses me completely and why I hate the message. It's trying way too hard to tear down his goals for no real reason at all and goes so far as to even frame it as having goals being a bad thing. It tries too hard to paint a very specific message to the audience and basically does so at the expense of itself; it's trying to say to live in the moment and appreciate what you have, but is also saying to not get focused on goals when the two are not diametrically opposed whatsoever -- you very much can do both simultaneously as well.

So so much of the writing just falls completely flat because the movie goes out of its way to *show* us that he's enjoying his life, he's just upset at himself for not having attained this one goal yet essentially. It also sets up an entire angle of him inspiring others via the teacher route only to drop it completely very early on into the film. It's really poor writing to have so many blown instances of foreshadowing like that.

I dunno, it's just such a wishy washy film that really has nothing to say. It feels self important and then you step back and go, ""huh, that was a lot of beautifully stated bullshit."" I'm glad it seems to resonate with many, but personally it falls completely flat.

This is absolute nonsense. Not only is it explicitly stated that soul #22 doesn’t even have a race or gender, but they completely missed the entire point of Joe’s epiphany.

The Dakota War of 1862, also known as the Sioux Uprising, the Dakota Uprising, the Sioux Outbreak of 1862, the Dakota Conflict, the U.S.–Dakota War of 1862 or Little Crow's War, was an armed conflict between the United States and several bands of Dakota (also known as the eastern Sioux). It began on August 17, 1862, along the Minnesota River in southwest Minnesota, four years after its admission as a state. Throughout the late 1850s in the lead-up to the war, treaty violations by the United States and late annuity payments by Indian agents caused increasing hunger and hardship among the Dakota. During the war, the Dakota made extensive attacks on hundreds of settlers and immigrants, which resulted in settler deaths, and caused many to flee the area.

Because Joe already represented something to Connie, he was ""love of making music"" to Connie. He didn't need to encourage Connie any more than he already had. That's the whole ""Maybe you can be someone else's spark"" thing. 

But I understand what you mean. It was 22 in that body. But Connie valued Joe because Joe was in that body the previous times Connie needed someone to encourage her to accept how much she loved trombone.

So when I went to college the people I met and my interactions with them all of a sudden I was able to provide definitions my passions or sparks.  

Moreover I think what was more helpful was watching other people being confident in their endeavors and supportive of others in theirs. It help provide me confidence to pursue my own sparks and new sparks even after college when all my friends scatter all around the world.  

That being said there were and will high and low moments that has required me to really work on my maintaining my mental health. 


>This movie simultaneously gave me hope and happiness, mixed in with 22's fear and anxiety. It managed hit home a little bit too much.


Im in my 30s and it still hit way too close to home.  But give credit to the film makers.

>The things I used to enjoy are merely collecting dust in my room. I think I'm afraid of the rejecting, so I choose not to do things instead.  
>A downwards spiral.  


That's okay.  I had abandoned my passions only to return to them when I was in the right frame of mind to pursue them. Let those things collect dust, they will be there when you are ready for them. 


>Used to love music, especially movie and game scores. Even did some myself, but it faded as I always felt I was not as good, never being able to even get close to my idols.  


That's okay too. Its okay to compare your music to the greats. I love to write music and I can get competitive some of the songs I hear on the radio.  For some people that is what motivates them.  If you are getting frustrated with your work, it okay to take a break and walk away for a bit.  Again songwriting will always be there whether it is on a keyboard or just humming a tune in the shower.  You can return to whenever you are ready. 


>I'm just living. Just like Joe, getting by, except he managed to find that spark again. Pretty sure mine is lost.
>
>I'm just ""here"", you know?


Your spark is not lost.  The fact you are lamenting over losing it means it is still there.  Just keep in mind that a spark is just one ingredient that is needed to start a fire. You need tinder and kindling to get the fire going.  This true for any passion you may have. You have the desire to do it but if you don't have the physical, mental, and emotional space available it may be hard to pursue.  

Also being here is okay.  For some people just being here is enough to reset and get back on track.  Others need some support from friends and family.  While some others need the support of a professional such as a therapist.  And there is no right way or wrong way.  Just whatever way you feel is best for you.",kkbd5s
ghmvp3w,"I know what you mean. That's sort of the point of the movie though. The spark is just your willingness to live and find joy in all the little things in life, the people you love, and the choices you make to make yourself happier.

gh28kyn,"That view from Queensboro Plaza just rocked me. My emotions from that montage mixing with my memory and vision of that actual location was an indescribable moment. I live off Vernon-Jackson and honestly love that bend on the subway where you see the back of Silvercup and the city for many reasons: 1. The bend in the track was a signal that I was almost home and 2. that view between Hunters Point and Queensboro Plaza might be my favorite view of the city. I used to live in Astoria off Ditmars and I always made it a point to turn toward a window wherever I was in the subway car and look at the city once the train emerged from Hunters Point. Even if I was having a particularly bad day, the view of the city (and especially around the sunset hour) would calm me because at the end of the day, I lived in the greatest city in the world and was making it happen by the grace of God.

Yes, “Soul” really did capture the vibe, didn’t it? The energy you feel while walking the streets, and the moments of reflection and quiet (and awe) that you experience when you can look at the skyline and take it all in. 

That moment in the movie really got me.",kkbd5s

gh2qhjz,"I’m from PA- close enough to NYC that we could take day trips to see a show. I went probably once a year, or maybe 8-10 times total. And man- those trips were exhilarating but also exhausting. I never understood how anyone could possibly live there. I ended up getting a job in NYC, and the first time I ever spent the night here was when I moved into my first apartment. 

It took me about half a year to start to “get it”, and about a full year to really embrace it. 

Please come and visit as much as you’d like! I’m not quite sure if visitors will ever have the opportunity to dive into the culture the way that people who live here do, just because so much of it is a “daily grind” type of a feeling. But when you visit: explore new neighborhoods (especially in Brooklyn and Queens!), try new cuisines, do a ton of walking, and see if you can find some of the quirky independent stores/cafes/theater experiences. That will help you see more of why it’s so beloved.",kkbd5s
gh1qi53,Thanks for the recommendation! I haven’t seen it. I’ll give it a watch.,kkbd5s
gh2patw,"NYC is a tough place to live. You pay a ton of money for a tiny apartment which often doesn’t have the comforts and amenities you might have grown up with (or would be helpful): a washer/dryer, a dishwasher, central air, any outdoor space. It might be a 5th-floor walk-up. You’ll likely have a roommate (someone you know? Or a complete stranger? Who knows) not just when you first move here, but for years to come (probably longer than your friends in the suburbs or in other cities). 
The daily subway grind is tough. You’re totally at the mercy of the trains, and if they are delayed (which they often are), you’ll try to decide whether you should give up and just Uber to work, or hold out for the train. And if it does arrive- will there even be space for you to get on?
Summers are brutal. Winters are rough. And the glorious fall and spring days seem few and far between.  
It’s loud. It’s dirty. It’s crowded. 

However-
That’s all negated by the wonderful things the city has to offer: world-class museums. Incredible theater and entertainment from Broadway’s biggest and glitziest stages to tiny independent comedy and music performances. Quirky local stores. Bars, cafes, and restaurants on every block. Beautiful urban parks. And, of course: literally any kind of cuisine and culture you could possibly imagine. 
You come to learn that the city has a life. A pulse. Each neighborhood has its own identity. And there’s nothing more fun than walking for hours and uncovering the little gems you find along the way. 

Unfortunately, the pandemic has shut down everything that makes the city so wonderful. Museums are sort of reopening, but theater is closed until further notice. Same with indoor dining and bars. The pulse of the city, which used to be a strong heartbeat, is now more of a flutter. 

Now we’re left to face the difficult realities of living in NYC without the things that make it worth it. I’m trying to do my part as a New Yorker to stay and support the city, but it’s admittedly tough at times. 

Maybe it’ll be a different story by the time you move here? Rents are down in Manhattan, so maybe now is a good time to move here and lock in a cheaper rent? Not sure if you already have a job or would be searching, but many office-type industries are WFH for the foreseeable future. I trust you’ll do some research and make the decision that is best for you.",kkbd5s

And that also completely invalidates the expectation that was building for me, which is fine. An interesting mislead and unexpected as I said 😀. 

He definitely had his eyes opened to those around him by the events of mentoring and showing 22 around. He likely will find and share more joy in his life because of that.

That tagline ""[he is] going to live every minute of it"" feels like a circular, pretty sounding platitude than anything with underlying meaning 🤷‍♂️. Definitely a philosophy on life, but not the spark we were chasing the whole time or a clear resolution to his arc.

Then why is 22 voiced by a white woman ? Why are all the voices that aren't visibly black happen to be white (in other words, why are the raceless-souls defaulted to white voices) ?

> I mean would you rather have white kids only see us as criminals and thugs, or have them be shown positive examples of us?

I will be honest, but I don't care how they looking at us. We weren't human at first, we're still not. They're still debating (in bad faith) on giving us humanity. That's why the sentence ""Representation matters"" is exclusively targeted to the folks stripped of humanity, to show them a mirror in which they can exist. It's definitely not to reshape how they look at us. It's for *who is being represented*. That's all I'm saying. The underlying debate doesn't have its place here (I don't know who can read us). 

> How is that being blind to race?

The comment I replied to was happy about race not being discussed in the comments, and was congratulating themselves for being to a point where ""race does not matter"". This is exactly what race blindness is. Like you said the plot could exist with anyone else, so anyone saying the movie does a flower to Black ppl is just lying in everyone face. Yet, many depictions of Black lives (barbershop and family relations to start with) were still shown. So we have to overlook the use of these scenes by a white director ? Again, this is race blindness. Being happy that nobody is giving critical thoughts about the dynamics at stake there isn't a good thing.

> The film takes place in New York not some African city

For one, you can have a monogamous universe while staying in NYC. Plenty movies of all genres have done that for decades. And you definitely don't have to go in Africa to see Black communities. I'm not sure why you commented that.  
By ""universe"", I'm talking about the movie's. In this one, the main setting is the Soul place, that's where the 2 leads are meeting and where everything is played out. And even there, it was hard to not see white saviourism dynamics. >!How come a black man, which is the child of centuries of struggle, has to give up his dreams and everything for a raceless child ? How come the raceless child in the body of the black man is the one saving him in his encounter with his barber or his mother ? Our dude has literally no agency in his life ! Taking a step back, this is basically the story of a raceless child that goes into the body of a black man and get to enjoy life the way the black man couldn't. This is actually horrible put it like that. It really erased the importance of Black experience, the stress it adds into life, the traumas, the deaths, etc. It may be a child movie, but damn still.!<

To him, that decision to enter the zone and rescue 22 was a totally selfless act that would leave him to the great beyond.

*But the point of Joe's journey was that he was too focused on his music to enjoy life to its fullest. The little moments during his piano epiphany are a realization of the kind of moments he was disregarding and how many more of them he could have had. Dying would mean the lesson was pointless and more of a tragic realization. Fitting for a tragedy but not in line with the actual tone of the story.

*I'm not sure accepting death when there's a reason to live is the kind of message you want in a family movie that easily impressionable kids are gonna watch.

The movie is essentially about the Phoenix Effect. Someone that has a near death experience and finds a new appreciation for life (he's even in a coma).

That's kind of how I was thinking, too. I feel like they've done heavier/sadder endings than this would have been had he died. But, ultimately, I'm not that mad about it I guess.

Yeah, I guess that is a good point. After all, when he went back to get 22, he didn't die or go into a coma. He just went into the Zone and then made his way to the You Seminar from there. So, he wasn't even really dead. He also learned a lot from 22 that would affect how he lives his life going forward.

So yeah, I can see what you're getting at. I think there's just a cynical part of my brain that tells me ""Disney really didn't want this to end with the protagonist dying, huh?""

gq7nf9p,"But presumably other souls did indeed get a spark for food (or pizza or whatever).  Without being able to taste it or meaningfully experience it.  I get that playing baseball as a soul is slightly different from the physical exertion of playing baseball... But is playing a piano?  What about a person whose spark is movie-watching?  Is that really so different without a body?  

In other words the movie tried to have it both ways... You have no body so you can't eat... But you can see and hear?  And presumably some sense of touch exists though it's different from controlling physical muscles... But these differences are not examined or considered in any meaningful way.  

Regarding the pizza example, I guess one could say ""Oh it creates a desire to try the real thing (for some, but not for 22)!"" In the same way that clever fans can always justify poor internal logic.

But honestly I'm much more concerned about the idea that personality is determined for an individual soul by what appears random sorting, but that somehow whether we like pizza or jazz is portrayed as a more meaningful choice reserved for the soul itself?

Though really it seems like an illusion of choice since souls must ""find"" their spark rather than just consciously choose it.  So ultimately it seems like it's being chosen by the quantum terry/jerry anyways.  Like the movie doesn't want to portray Jerry/Terry as God, but it also has very unclear statements regarding free will.

The icing on this heaping pile of nonsense is the heavy handed ""silly mortals, you don't understand anything"" and later ""the secret to life is to LIVE"".  But how can a Jerry-assigned-paranoid-meglaniac hope to even come to such a conclusion?  

I get that the movie tried to make cheap jokes, at the expense of it's plausibility.

Plus, if this movie were to be about death, it’d probably be way different than what we got. Death in Soul is treated very casually. As Terry said, 1.75 souls go to The Great Beyond every second. 

For Joe’s death to work, a lot more attention would be needed to highlight the duality between Before and Beyond. Joe’s backstory would also need more focus, compared to the dioramas and snippets of interaction we got. Otherwise, he’d be like every other faceless soul on that conveyer. It’s a whole other movie at this point.

 I actually prefer it this way; if you’ve ever been to or lived in New York, it’s by nature metropolitan and cosmopolitan, so no one really gives a f*** what you are and you see people of all types, from Brooklyn to Chelsea. 

In addition, I think making the intention to be representation itself always backfires by trying too hard. Representation stands for itself best when you just let it be, and don’t try to proactively “do” it. In this way, Soul has race in the background, but it’s literally a movie about *souls*, not ethnicity, so who gives a damn.

Can Archimedes and Orwell, natively Greek and British, cooexist in the same film as the culture of jazz and its interstice with Black culture? Yeah, because what matters is our values and our intentions, things we can control, not any monolith of a culture or bearing on its own that we have no control in shaping.

But then the movie never actually shows Joe applying this to his life. He acted like he wasn't super satisfied with that jazz gig. Does he keep playing with them? He seemed to enjoy guiding 22 on her journey. Does he keep teaching and providing lessons to Connie?

It showed the ""enjoying life's moments"" as mundane things like enjoying pizza and appreciating nature. So that's it? I think it would have been so much more effective if it showed Joe living a boring, predictable life, like always watching the same TV shows and eating from the same take out places. Then, it opens an opportunity to show him branch out and let life come to him more.

Joe in particular looms over her, as he managed to help get the spark, but still talked down to her in the end. Making her feel worse than she ever did.

Thats why sadness is so important, it means you actually feel something and it allows you to feel happiness too.

So i think the reason why it resonates with me so heavily is that, as i was in my early twenties when i watched it, (i’m now in my mid twenties) i’ve become more emotionally in tune with myself. Males are pressured to bottle things up inside and feel bad about feeling sad. We shouldnt run away from sadness, we should embrace it, acknowledge it, and look forward to the happiness and other emotions that come after it. Cus if you dont, you lose yourself, your mental health is affected

Doesn't matter how careless you are in life, or how many times you try to *cheat souls out of existence*, so long as you have second thoughts you'll get everything you want.

gh218kn,"Mindfulness is a supremely difficult aspect of mental health, even to those who might have fulfilling or otherwise meaningful lives and professions. I’m glad to have a Pixar movie that didn’t rely so heavily on the lives or actions of its characters as a focal point for emotions. I loved Inside Out, but movies like that or Up feel like they’re cheating when it comes to affecting me emotionally, relying on very heavily emotional topics when the standard Pixar cry moment comes up. While Soul still hits me deep while not necessarily relying on the emotional hammer of it all.  

That’s why I disagree on your take or reliance on having teaching be the focal point of Joe’s journey. You can have those meaningful moments, but part of Joe’s growth and Moonwind’s warning is that we can’t focus on them.",kkbd5s
gh4sd78,"The film has real Buddhist underpinnings to me. I did a couple of checks, and it does look like they researched a lot of different faiths making the film, and particularly stuff like Buddhism. Buddhism is curiously one of the faiths that doesn't believe in the concept of a soul in the Western sense, which I don't think is antithetical to the whole premise of this film because I think for the most part this film is *also* examining how we should re-evaluate our Western understanding of what the soul means, or broadly what the purpose of life is.

I think the ""just enjoy life"" angle is much more nuanced than you think. The film does give you the emotional hook of the scene of him enjoying the mundane things in life but the takeaway is more that you shouldn't *worry* about purpose, another pretty Buddhist idea. Richard Ayoade's Jerry character even spells it out when he mockinglg says ""Your mentors and your passions! Your purposes. Your meanings of life. So basic.""

I get that most of the explanations for the payoff and messaging happen in the last half hour or so, but they seem like a pretty natural  leadup from what happened beforehand. The narrative momentum in the main part of the film is more carried by 22's character arc more than Joe who frankly is just a cat shouting ""i need to get back to fulfil my purpose"" for half the film. They don't really make a comment on whether his purpose is correct or not in the first place, so I don't think reading the film in that way is necessarily beneficial. Even the thing with the barber, they're not saying that he's happy being a barber not a vet *because* turns out his real passion was actually saving lives at the end of the day (that seemed like just a funny aside more than anything), it's just that being a vet was not the end-all for his happiness.",kkbd5s

ghwcdiw,"I think they did a great job telling the audience that he lived a mundane and unfulfilling life.

Thursday evening her doctor tells me that I can expect her heart rate to drop below forty. He was being nice. What he meant was ‘she’s going to die tonight’ and we both knew it.

So that night I stayed up in her room, crying, mourning my baby girl. And waiting, because when the end came I wanted to be there to hold her hand so she could die knowing she was loved. 

I knew my dad had Chevra Kadisha on standby. I knew we had a grave for her (two, actually.) And I knew she was going to die, so I mourned her.

And in that mourning I found peace. Acceptance. Peace. Gratitude. Gratitude for the eleven months I’d had her. The nine when her heart beat beneath mine, and the two when she was mine to hold and cuddle and nurse. Eleven months to love my baby girl.

And if that was all the time I was given? Well, at least I had had that time. Time that was worth every moment. And I could accept that. I could be grateful for it. I could accept her death because of the gift that was her life.

And then she survived that night. And the next. And the one after. My miraculous Thanksgiving baby. (Yes, she was born on Thanksgiving.) She’s four years old now, still healing, but alive and well. So this story has a happy ending, unlike many others.

It seemed like that was planting the seeds of the idea that Joe is a little bit too obsessed with his own interests, to the exclusion of others.

Like, I think the idea that Joe has professional success with gigs in the future is fine, but the ending should've, in some way, acknowledged Joe having just a bit less tunnel vision about it.  I will say the ending kind of does with the montage, but I thought it should've been more prominent.  Just my $.02.",kkbd5s
ghf2oel,"Joe was always laser focused on his dream. He has to achieve it to finally wake the fuck up.

The dream turned out to be smoke and mirrors. He had to learn that life was more than it.

Yes, it took him being a selfish ass to get there, but he does come around in the end.

It was a realistic way to handle Joe's arc imo. He literally just met 22. He has spent his whole life chasing his dream though. Of course he was going to make a faulty decision.

The man died because he couldn't be bothered to pay attention after landing a gig. 

It took something really personal to jolt him to the way things really are. 22 wasn't going to do that by herself. Joe needed to have a personal epiphany.

Only then would he be able to get his head out of his ass. 

The message overall was, ""Don't let your obsessions ruin your life."" 

Joe wouldn't have learned that if he didn't achieve his dream. He had been ruining his life by being laser focused on his goal.",kkbd5s

Do you see it now? And this movie is telling the poor to just ""watch the leaf fall"" while their life-hood is quietly and slowly stolen away from them. This is so f*&k up.

We are NOT living in a society where equal effort warrants equal returns and the disparity of wealth is so staggering that fundamental systematic change is required immediately. This is NOT a time to ask people to ""enjoy the little things"", this is a time to ask people to make a difference, regardless what your role is in this society.

This is such a feel-good movie for lower-middle-class white people when the heroes of the movie - the black/brown communities are actually trying to make their ends meet every, single, day.

gzk2d0g,"People hate cancel culture and race conversation because it's uncomfortable and hard to relate from everyone's siloed POVs. (No bc people say you can’t feel what i’m feeling that kinda stops the discussion right there)  
People like me who call out fake ""woke""(gate keep much) culture then get flack for it because just like taking medicine that doesn't taste good, no one wants to take it(how are you, like medicin, making things better?).  
This movie tried to claim itself to be part of a ""representation matters""(where? when?) movement when the main character isn't even in his own body for majority of the movie(this point means what?). This also happened in princess of the frog when tiana, a black woman - as strong of a protagonist as she was - was still a frog for majority of the movie(this means what?).  
Outside of black culture, even in Asian culture, they still didn't get it right(do they get white culture right?). They turned Mulan into a Jedi, not a normal girl who learned through her own wit and determination.. They just made her a superhero.  
What's the message behind that? Just like Rey all of a sudden being related to Palpatine.... Because from someone who isn't white or wealthy, it sure looks like the new modern message is that the true heroes of this world dont earn shit, they just are they way they are because they come from families or generations that have harbored wealth or knowledge long enough to just wake up badass(well most people are in someway related to “a badass” and it gives the story more depth maybe?).  
Tiana had help from her rich white friend. Joe Gardner gets help from a timeless soul who had all the greatest teachers of history(isnt’ this stretching your theory a bit?). Mulan and Rey are ""born"" with it(everyone is and that is mostly how storys are made but there are also other storys that aint like that). Disney has not done SHIT to ""correct"" any of its racist history(who will be helped by them changing things that happend a long time ago?). Its not genuine, and they're only superficially pandering to audiences of color BECAUSE of this ""cancel culture"".  
What's annoying is the fake woke people are actually buying into this shit thinking Disney is being ""progressive"" but they're not(“yEah they do something when it dosn’t matter bc before they did bad and changing things dosent help bc that makes them not genuine” this feels like a catch 22 for them).  
It's still the same shit, prettier package(“not enough”).  
I know it's super uncomfortable to think that the happy mouse ears aren't so innocent, but the message is clear: the rich and powerful are who give you the opportunity to reach your goals either by gifting it to you (for your obedience and submission) or by birthing you into royalty, or some high caste system that embues you with the sense of ""obligation"" because of your ranking(there are no self made billionaires or dictators or anything like that? ).  
Anna gets to save the poor black guard stuck in the enchanted forest and Elsa becomes basically a god(You are talking about the movie with the talking snowman?) (there goes that good ol' white hero complex(so it is white hero complex bc the person is white? or bc it is supposed to play out in like norway?)) but Joe Gardner gets to become a cat/metaphysical buddy for a bratty soul, and Tiana gets to be a green swamp guide for a bratty prince(feels like you are choosing your examples very carefully now).  
So... Black people are just story vehicles for immature characters that need a touch of the ""black struggle"" to become better beings?(or it could be that the main characther is supposed to face difficulty and adversity)  
...weird, if I was writing a story about representation and black culture, I wouldn't be placing anyone else's narratives in the story other than theirs. That barber shop scene wasn't ""sweet"" or ""deep"" to me.  
To me, it showed how little Joe knew how to connect with his own community(or just that we are all not very good at connecting to the community?), and until 22 came in, and brought a ""deeper meaning"" to their conversations, they didn't embrace Joe the way they did in that scene.  
Sorry, but perhaps this discussion thread just hasn't been confronted with enough real life blatant racism, but to me, that scene was another display of the white savior complex where it took an educated white person to connect with ""the people"" to the point where people are enamored by 22's other worldly knowledge, and then shift to give Joe respect he didnt have before, since the implication is that he's just so in his head about his own shit that he never tried to connect to his own people. ( thought you would  say something a bit deeper and more insightful after that very strong opening)   
All Disney did in this movie was prove they have evolved past drawing blackface now and actually took the time out to study black facial features and expressions accurately... Which only begs the question... Why now do you all of a sudden know how to capture the correct details?(“you did good now, why didnt you always do this god disney”) What, somehow in the past 60 years, the animation team was suddenly like ""OHH!! THATS WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE!""(examples of this?)  
Yeah, not buying it. They're racist fucks, and they count on their branding, merchandising, entertainment, and media influence to distract people like you into believing its all ""meta humor.""(you did watch the movie, so basically you are buying it )  
I don't want to ""cancel"" anything(but you do what to call the nazis and racist fucks), but until Americans are willing to see that they are NOT the ""default"" of people(they are the default of people in the movies that THEY make) and do NOT represent people globally(they said this?), the race conversation needs to continue to happen, cause clearly, American companies still aren't getting it. These statements support power and elitism, not inclusion and progressive action.  
I would much rather these movies come out with the blatant message that they will never give a fuck about poor people than this lie they keep feeding us that this ""struggle"" is what ""builds character""(this comming from a persen “from a long line of generational wealth that has been complicit for centuries” )  
Did you give a shit enough to reach down to the bottom of this post? If you did, are you now out of spite, going to downvote this because I brought up something that you either can't or don't agree with and it made you feel some sort of way? (do you not use the voting buttons?)  
Weird. I'm not the one ""canceling"" YOUR voice out, am I?(do you also feel like someone voting for another candidate then you is removing your vote? )  
But keep projecting that I'm promoting ""cancel culture"" by calling out shit you don't want to deal with( you are just not seeing this in colour). I dont want them to ""take down"" their movies or cancel Eminem or any of that other dumb shit.(ok)  
Do not confuse my frustration with the likes of bored children who want to feel for feels sake(why not?). Perhaps there are people in the world who have worked in or for these toxic environments, such as animation companies, financial industries, and the like, and have firsthand knowledge to the dirty and ugly truths of these industries.

Also, the assumption that someone can have time to watch a movie, ponder it, and write a review as someone who could be ""more productive with their time"" is a subjective point of view because everyone manages their time differently. Productivity doesn't equal the inability to do things others consider a ""leisure activity."" \[(Yes it is subjective, but if you are calling out other people without any work/contribution of your own it would be hypocritical)\]  
I can appreciate the questioning of if my callouts imply that I am doing the things that I'm complaining others don't do, because, yes, I do live and operate at the standard that I am stating the rest of humanity can get to, but more than often doesn't\[( I guess you are the 1% then...)\].

That isnt age specific -- anyone from any age can have a perspective that shines a new light or alternate thinking path to consider, so I'm not exclusive to my thoughts or my opinions. They are on a platform like this for exactly responses like yours that took the time to question and challenge things that either you maybe didn't agree with, or couldn't fully see from my perspective.

Your quote is a great quote and I agree with its sentiment as far as the three ways to handle anything, however to your statement ""you can just act"" is a bit redundant\[(absolutely not redundant if people would act according to their “truth” instead of just reacting to their environment we would be in a better place right now )\], since every action after another action IS a REaction unless there is no action at all, so unless you are initiating the act, every action is a reaction\[(hahahaha low level thinking)\].  
No I did not react to the movie well, and I shared that. Are you saying that all negative reactions define someone's total character?\[(haha i’m saying all reactions define character, you choosing to not enjoy the movie even though that is why it was made and probably why you choose to watch it, also define character)\] And if so, do you never have negative reactions?\[( hahahaha what kind of question is that? I just try to not focus on the negative, and when i encounter negative, not let it taint me cause what good would that do? )\]  
What are we trying to associate here? That those who aren't happy about their experiences shouldn't share them and should only share things they reacted to well?\[(well how is anyone that was part of making that movie gonna react to be called glitter nazis, racist, whealthy and unbothered, why would they take that critic seriously? if i would do the same to you would yo respond?(((hahahahahaha and by me putting you in the spot like that, i wonder what you're gonna do))) )\] Where would we be able to learn or advance past our current understanding then?\[(You have never learned from a positive experience? then maybe you should look for more positive experiences, and negative experiences could come from other places then people name calling)\]  
Or, on the third option -- should we never react to anything at all?(yeah that is what i said when i meant when i said you should just act )  
I don't think that's what you were saying, so it brings me to question... what exactly was your point in your response...? \[(ill condense it for you, Stop reacting to negative shit, stop reading negative shit into stuff(that isnt there), stop name calling, try to see/experience positive things it will not only help you, but people around you. And dont say you are not a negative person,  you mean to say positive people would say glitter nazi?)\]  
I don't think there was anywhere that I placed in this comment that I'm a ""non-reactor"" \[(no just not a person that acts but a person that only can REact to other people’s actions)\] so I'm a bit confused with whatever this response ""makes me"" in your eyes, but if it helps you identify responses like mine as a categorized personality, then I hope this gave you whatever deeper perspective you needed to further ""assess"" my reddit thread.

The film did discuss that with the barber since he did say that he was going to be a vet until life took him in a different direction.

If you want to be a lawyer but hate everyday life, you wont be able to be happy even if you got where you wanted to be.

The fish analogy in the end was perfect for this, when the little fish wanted to see the ocean, while he was swimming in it the whole time. Joe was living life already, he just wasnt able to live it because he was obsessed with that one thing that would finally make his life better.

When he was finished with his gig he realised that playing the piano was all he wants to do, no matter where it is. Thats why he plays it right afterwards alone in his apartement, getting just the same fullfillment from it (arguably even more). He expected the gig to start his life, but it just left him with emptiness because it was still just him playing the piano.

That’s what 22 learned, live and let yourself flow with your surroundings, that’s what 22 did and she loved it.

It’s kind of sad that you can miss the message of the movie entirely. Existence is so absurd and beautiful, and yet we as people will still get caught up in our day-to-day lives, just drifting aimlessly through the only thing we will ever know and feel.

 The message is about enjoying the simple joys of life, that we are constantly chasing goals and passions while forgetting that there is beauty in the small moments.

Also joe doesn't ask him what's going on he says "" why aren't you running?"" And the guy says exactly ""I don't know"" and not in a bored teenager way. Also the people at the end seemed like more well roumded people not just new souls with base attributes like the ones in the before time.

Edit: Joe also says ""what's wrong with you people"" and the same souls says again just ""I don't know"" but ge doesn't sound like a teenager at all and says it in a deadpan way I can't really put an emotion to it, not happy, sad, bored or depressed.",kkbd5s

gh4x0ol,"Joe being black is not racist. 

Please be more specific in how this or that action is racist, or it will simply look like to are claiming the presence of race alone is the mark of racism. It’s not like there are people born who don’t have a race. People typically don’t survive are grow up to be voice actors without any skin. You might find that rather difficult.

Here, let me lay this out in steps.

1.	Joe asks why this abstract soul baby character “22” sounds like a real white woman rather than all the other identical children.
2.	22 says she can sound like anything she wants.
3.	22 says she chose her specific voice because she likes how it annoys people.

Now, what we are missing here is the part where-

4.	22 says White Women voices annoy people well.

That doesn’t happen. 22 only specifies that her voice is effective at annoying people. Jamie Foxx specifies and perceives her voice as white, but 22 doesn’t elaborate on her whiteness or specify anything about race. You are making the classic mistake of confusing correlation with causation.

Now, if you would like to suppose that there is a common and hurtful belief out there that “white women have annoying voices”, then perhaps you could go on from there, and then make a compelling argument that this is an unstated assumption that is not made by the characters, but assumed by the creators the audience would make on their own.

Unfortunately, you have not made your argument clear.",kkbd5s

He was a part time band teacher who worked in an underfunded school and worked side gigs. His mother was always pushing him to get a proper job with some safety. Historically a lot of black and African American populations in New York have faced generations of issues and I won't call them privileged at all. Maybe they're relative to where I am from but not by US standards. Even in the us music is often so limited to people from well off families (like look at the success of Taylor swift or Miley Cyrus).",kkbd5s
gh8jeu4,"Because as soon as she looked at him she realized that he wasn't Joe. Plus it's a cartoon and the scene was supposed to be funny. Not everything in the movie is 100% logically sound. 

(Why do we see the cat soul going to the Great Beyond but it's still alive when Joe returns to his body?)",kkbd5s
gh5vr7t,"His dad lived a fulfilling life, why would he be concerned about him? Was there anything in the movie that pointed to him facing the great beyond and feeling like he had more to do? He didn't achieve all his initial dreams as a jazz musician, as his mother said - but watch the memories Joe relives as he sits at his piano again. His dad lived to an older age, with a wife he loved, and a son he introduced and shared a passion with. His father shared small, intimate moments with them that made him love life outside of any ""purpose"", and made his life worthwhile regardless of whether he achieved that purpose or not. With all that in mind, what would finding his father have added to like, anything here? 

There is absolutely zero reason established by the film to believe the great beyond was even a place where you experienced a consciousness, let alone one you could meet up with loved ones. I would even go as far as saying that a traditional idea of heaven in the movie's context undermines its message that is spelled out in its last lines, which is to enjoy life in all its big AND small ways while you can.

Although you've a valid observation about the character wasting an opportunity to meet his dad. It's not mentioned in the plot and not referred in a direct way. I mean, I've my interpretation about it, but it sounds like a rationalization and not something presented in the movie.

Because all the souls go to The Great Beyond, and there isn't a single soul that has lived in the place where Joe appears. So it makes sense that all the concerns about dead relatives are fixed in the notion that all of them are in that zone out of reach, where they are one with that...light or whatever.

gi49xm4,"Yeah I literally have no idea what you’re talking about. I was expecting all types of “childish” humor from ADD type loud characters that are typical in kids films, but this one had none of that. I’ve watched the movie four times now and I do not recall any kind of pooping jokes, especially as you described. I don’t remember anyone eating pizza and shitting it out with an exaggerated pop sound. Like I’m wondering if we even saw the same thing or maybe I just have a really bad memory. I don’t recall any kind of joke about a cat jumping at bright lights. Doing “stereotypical cat things”? Uh okay. I mean seriously? He’s not supposed to act like a cat? And 22 “literally doing whatever is stupidest and contrarian to Joe’s desires in every scene she’s in”? Uh except she’s not?? In MOST of their scenes, they are working together. Honestly, it really sounds like you’re reaching trying to find things to complain about. 

I was genuinely asking for examples of this “bottom tier lowest hanging fruit type humor” that you spoke of since I’m shocked anyone thought this film had that. (I think I do know the type of humor you’re talking about, I think it’s found in most kids’ films, just not this one.) if you didn’t find the humor funny, I get that, but I don’t agree that the humor is bottom barrel catering to lowest common denominator.

gh3i0fv,"I guess you missed the part where they said that they were looking for the spark and not one's purpose. Joe and even us in the audience automatically assumed they meant purpose.

The spark is something that is innate and can create a sense of connection within oneself. When you have a spark it's easy to get in the zone while doing it since it lights something inside of us that just feels right. For some it's academics, arts, or even power and it feels like it flows through you in a very strong way. At least that is my interpretation of what it means.

As for Joe not being a lost soul, I think he still had hope within his passion. He could've been a lost soul when he was in the zone but it seems like he was more aimless than depressed, angry, or sad about what he was trying to achieve. 22 was experiencing anger and depression when she couldn't figure out what her purpose was. That frustration caused her to become recluse and lash out at the world. Joe hadn't lashed out at his family, he was more delusional in expecting that all he needed was one strong break. I feel he was on his way there. He was on his way toward becoming an angry musician who would've been mad at the world for not giving him a chance. When he goes through his memories it seems he was remembering them differently than how they played out so that he can keep going.

I remember one of the lost souls had lost themselves in their work and they were in a corporate job. They weren't pursuing anything and had basically shut down so they can just exist and it wasn't until the shaman dude pulled him out of it that he decided to make a change and go for something more. He was reminded that he missed feeling alive. Joe felt alive when he played but he didn't have a purpose outside of feeling good the few times he got into the groove. He was lucky to have been able to do the thing that gave him the spark and he hadn't given up yet.

It's literally explained that she chose to sound like a middle age white lady to be annoying. And the only raceless souls are pre-born ones, and all them have generic baby voices that could belong to any race.

>I will be honest, but I don't care how they looking at us. We weren't human at first, we're still not. They're still debating (in bad faith) on giving us humanity. That's why the sentence ""Representation matters"" is exclusively targeted to the folks stripped of humanity, to show them a mirror in which they can exist. It's definitely not to reshape how they look at us. It's for who is being represented. That's all I'm saying. The underlying debate doesn't have its place here (I don't know who can read us).

It can't be both? Representation Matters can mean just that, for a multitude of reasons. It doesn't have to matter for one reason.

>The comment I replied to was happy about race not being discussed in the comments, and was congratulating themselves for being to a point where ""race does not matter"". 

Because race didn't matter in the film. It was there and you could feel it, but it wasn't important to the message. It basically just gave the film more life. And there's nothing wrong with that, not every film featuring black characters needs to have race be the upfront topic, because race isn't always the upfront topic in real life.

>For one, you can have a monogamous universe while staying in NYC. Plenty movies of all genres have done that for decades. And you definitely don't have to go in Africa to see Black communities. I'm not sure why you commented that.

Every character who isn't a soul is black though..... and even if they weren't... so? The film is not obligated to portray such a universe just because it stars a black character.

>How come a black man, which is the child of centuries of struggle, has to give up his dreams and everything for a raceless child ? 

Because he took her earth pass? The dude literally died, it's not like it was rightfully his. He gave up everything when he fell down that manhole. And even then, the movie didn't end up like that. While he was willing to do that, he got his happy ending.

>How come the raceless child in the body of the black man is the one saving him in his encounter with his barber or his mother?

Because he isn't perfect? And it's not like he doesn't contribute to the convo with his mother, 22 is just repeating what he's telling her.

>Our dude has literally no agency in his life ! 

How? It's not like 22 was some Mary Sue who did everything, he had to get her on track multiple times to get his body across New York city. Plus how does it make sense to complain both about Joe having to save 22, and 22 helping him? It's a problem when he helps a raceless child, but it's also problematic when he's helped?

>Taking a step back, this is basically the story of a raceless child that goes into the body of a black man and get to enjoy life the way the black man couldn't.

I mean there's more to it than that, it's not fair to judge on an incomplete picture. The film ends with him learning from the experience and he'll also be able to enjoy life. Even then... what exactly is wrong with that? The film features the barber who found a way to enjoy life, so just because every black person couldn't figure out how to enjoy life, it means its horrible? A protagonist needs flaws to have an intriguing story. I don't see how the film could have worked if it was under your standards.

>This is actually horrible put it like that.

Well, no shit, that's a terrible argument. ""Well, Black Panther was the story about an African King learning a valuable lesson from an American terrorist so that makes it bad"".

>It really erased the importance of Black experience, the stress it adds into life, the traumas, the deaths, etc.

Because it wasn't about that? It seems like you just wanted them to make a movie about something else, and that's not really fair. It was about a man who was so focused on finding his purpose he forgot to sit back and enjoy the slow moments. Why the hell do we need to bring up deaths?

Don't you think some of us are tired of not having a movie about Black people not be all about all that? There's more to life than trauma and death, it shouldn't be erasure to simply have a movie featuring black people to not be about that.

The Black experience is not the same for everybody, I myself typically don't experienced the stuff you mentioned, so it's not wrong for a black character to have a single story that doesn't revolve around that.

It would be different if this a tv show titled ""The Life of Joe Gardner"", and it *never* came up, throughout the multitude of stories.

>But if we're critically talking race, there's a lot of flaws in it.

Because it didn't feature the exact experience that you wanted shown, and because the main character didn't do everything?",kkbd5s

Joe at the piano entered that realm because he lost himself to his music and the memories 22 gave him in his own body. That brought him peace and he centered himself and was still very much alive.

That is why he could interact  with her and spinning sign guy in that realm. Also the life he was living was 22's which is why he gave it back to her. He borrowed her life to finish his day and complete his dream. He wasn't giving back his own life until the end. It wasn't suicide.",kkbd5s

ghfbchw,"the Phoenix effect would've made more sense if it happened only once. towards the end he's basically entering and exiting the astral plane as he pleases which kinda cheapens the entire ""slipping into the zone"" experience.

ghf4b4r,"I think, if they were to allow Joe to move on, they would have had to change some other points in the story.  Notably, the story makes a lot of effort to highlight how disconnected Joe was from others--however, if they sprinkled in a few more moments of connection that he *himself* had experienced, then I think they could have framed it as him being happy about the life he *lived* rather than the life he *could potentially live*.  Indeed, there was a little bit of that (in the afterlife he lived), which I think allowed for Joe's acceptance of moving on--but I agree not quite enough of it to justify moving beyond.

I'm a little on the fence as to which ending I think actually is more thematically appropriate.  On the one hand, I agree with the phoenix effect idea--this idea that he has a new appreciation of life and his opportunity to experience more of it.  On the other, letting him go back, almost feels like another attempt at ""fixing"" his life, rather than appreciating his life (though I think the dialogue exchange before he returns tries to clarify that his approach in fixing his life will be different).

In the end, I think you're right that just letting him move on would perhaps not quite serve the needs of the story, but I suspect with a few tweaks there would have been a version of him moving on that could have been more impactful (and not just from a feels perspective but from a thematic one).",kkbd5s

With Tiana I just view that as her being the lead of the kind of movie she was in.

To be fair, there really isn’t another Pixar movie that ended with nearly as much ambiguity as Soul

gh442r9,"They kinda do that in the ""exhibit"" where he's seen all alone doing stuff looking sad... For the relationship with his mum we have a whole scene dedicated to them not understanding each other not communicating. And for the teaching I thought it would be a spark, especially with Curly, but he looked kinda over his head at the beginning, not happy at the idea of doing it full time, he was ready to give up on the trombone kid for his gig...

I think his life being a bit sad is pretty well shown, and they show his obsession pretty well when he can't stop rushing 22, or when he never listens to his barber... I think we are made to believe that he was not far from being one of the lost souls, monomaniac and obsessed, too much in the zone. But I may be reading too much into it.",kkbd5s

gh1ylhk,"Not to mention that Joe wasn't talking down to her from his perspective that we see.

When he's like ""walking isn't a purpose, it's just part of living"" he's just saying that casually. Like ""oh you know it's part of living"". But because 22 had been belittled so much when we see the reflection of that, it's presented like ""no, stupid 22, that's not a purpose. You'd know that if you didn't suck"" and we see the point of why 22's soul was so lost. The intent didn't matter anymore behind what Joe said, it was 22's perception of it that mattered",kkbd5s
gh1u6l2,"I think they're saying they don't mind 22 being a Lost Soul, but the whole monster-chase with it was kind of extraneous.

They made the message pretty clear: life isn’t about waiting for your big day to come, you just have to live and enjoy the little things we all take for granted every day. (To be fair that is a message that would feel inappropriate for people

Which is why I said that Soul could have added whatever elements for the story to work. But the soul world and 22 did not do that properly and the movie would have been better off focusing on Joe and Trombone Girl in NYC.

Sure, you said a few things in your paragraph that sounds good but its from a place of ignorance.

I can see that as a reasonable takeaway from the movie, though I think it’s overshadowed by the simpler “live every moment and enjoy the mundane.” 


Even if I concede that your take is the principle moral of the movie, I still think that’s a mediocre message. There is a lot to be said for sacrifice and struggle and hard work towards achieving your goals... and yes, hating or not loving that process isn’t all bad. This movie is the antithesis to hard work and sacrifice for a reward.",kkbd5s
ghr2ice,"Well I think context is important here.

This is the very first Pixar film that has majority Black characters, which I think is wild that it took until 2020, but when you haven’t seen yourself up there represented in this way, and you finally get to do it, and you’re excited about it and can’t wait to see it, to watch and see for the majority of the film it is voiced by someone who isn’t Black, I can totally see how folks would be annoyed by it.

gh834re,"We have different interpretations on what the teaching epiphany means then. He discovers that his purpose in life wasn’t the purpose he thought he was looking for. He spends his whole life chasing his dream of being a musician, but doesn’t realise the meaning his life offered to those around him through his teaching, whether it’s Connie, Curly, or 22. I didn’t see it as he didn’t find purpose at all. To me he just found the meaning his life had wasn’t what he expected it to be.   

I mean, otherwise are you just suggesting that the movie’s message is “life is meaningless?” And that’s somehow meant to make everyone feel better about their place on the world? Nah. The movie’s pointing out how your impact on this planet goes beyond just what you want, just your hopes and dreams. There’s more to life than that.",kkbd5s

ghf3v5h,"No I’m not. I’m just giving an opinion on what I thought would make me enjoy the ending more. As you say, Joe is a selfish prick in these moments, and I didn’t like that part of the film. And I didn’t like the fact that the protagonist reacted in a certain way. Joe might have gone through his adult life with little to no friends, but I feel that (since he has/had compassionate relationships with his parents and others) he would definitely react with genuine compassion and regret following the fight with 22.
 
He could’ve competed his arc without conquering his dream. Because in my preferred ending: when he fails at his dream because he’s more concerned with his friend’s wellbeing that will make him realise how his dream (music) isn’t the most important thing in his life. He will realise that his interactions with others are what makes life meaningful",kkbd5s
ghwxf59,"I suppose this could explain why 22 did not live for so long. She could not find an activity that would check the box because she didn’t want to live. Still, I find that kind of absurd because it would imply our will to live is sort of false?",kkbd5s
gh3ouyt,"Perhaps. I think there could be a middle ground between accepting death and giving up on life. I think you can accept death in a way that’s still life-affirming. I’m not sure what that would look like in a Pixar movie, but I think it could be done.",kkbd5s

gh9pycz,">\[some people think that\] some babies in the womb are perfectly disposable

I mean, this statement presupposes that fetuses are alive, fully fleshed-out babies in the womb as opposed to, well, fetuses. It's clear that the pre-living and post-living landscape of Soul is pretty metaphor-heavy (e.g. a stairway to the afterlife as we popularly conceive of it, houses where you enter to develop common personality traits \[I hope it's redundant to say that no such houses exist\]), so I'm remiss to say that it translates 1:1 to the abortion debate.   


To your original comment: 

>The message is that life is worth living, and arguably that we don't  have any grounds to deny life to anyone else, i.e. unborn babies.

This statement jumps  from ""life is rich with fulfilling, sensual experiences"" to ""people should not have access to abortion"" (which is the fundamental argument of the unborn-fetus-activists). The film lends itself to such interpretation because of its use of a fictional pre-birth dreamscape, but does not support the practical effects of anti-abortion policy—making health care procedures inaccessible—which your claim defends. I don't think there's any grounds for an anti-abortion argument through this film.",kkbd5s

Amen",kkbd5s
gh90h95,"Do you even understand my perspective? 22 also called out the school system, why would anyone choose to live on earth when its basically a lottery, hoping you obtain a livable life? The souls seem comfortable in the Great before, they also have personality so its not like they're empty shells. 

It was such a idealization of life. If 22 were stuck with someone homeless in a shelter, would they obtain the same spark for living? 22 was hiding in the corner scared and hungry before Joe helped her, how would they feel if they had to feel that hunger constantly, not being able to afford pizza?

This movies message is almost condescending ""look at the trees, breath the air, and you'll be happy"" says someone from NYC in a paid apartment with a social circle. 

People can be grateful for the things in their life, but also be completely clueless and depressed and lost as to who they are at the same time. No amount of sky watching will be able to fix this.",kkbd5s

ghjjtne,"> the movie isn't directed at people who are having existential crises.

I don't see how you can say that... it's a film whos main inciting incident is the main character, who has failed his entire life to accomplish his goal, dies horribly by falling into a pit upon finally making a small break. And then his immediate reaction upon learning this in the afterlife is profound regret and a sense that his life is completely meaningless.

If that isn't the pure definition of existential dread then I'm not sure what you think it is.

The film absolutely wanted to address that issue and it did not succeed in providing an actual satisfying or useful answer to that problem at any point.",kkbd5s

Answers don't always come in a TL;DR, so sometimes the dialogue is long winded (and 992 words, thank you for the data!), and sometimes the dialogue is short. Like ours. If nothing else, thank you for quite literally proving my point by how little most people's attention spans are to learn anything beyond what they know or are comfortable with.

But I'm sorry, that still might have been too long of a response for you. Thank you for the pointers! ☺",kkbd5s
gzr59x7,"I'm not sure you understood my responses, and that's okay. 

A negative response doesn't equal a negative person, and your definition of a ""person that acts"" seems limited to only someone that can ""act"" positively, which makes them a ""positive"" person. Anger isn't a ""bad"" thing, and I agree that looking from a positive perspective is always the goal, but it isn't always reality.

I wrote a review about a movie. That means I'm aware I made the choice to watch it, then decided whether or not I liked it, and then decided to write about it. The reaction I chose to share is the one that prompted you to come after me -- which btw, unless you're a representative of Disney, you are responding as if I criticized you directly.

Even in your latest response, your ""laughing"" at my response doesn't show that you want to find an understanding or gain any more context from what I wrote -- it shows me that you strongly want to ""prove me wrong"" somewhere, when the perspective you're trying to prove is one I already have.

Your line ---ill condense it for you, Stop reacting to negative shit, stop reading negative shit into stuff(that isnt there), stop name calling, try to see/experience positive things it will not only help you, but people around you. And dont say you are not a negative person, you mean to say positive people would say glitter nazi?)] ---

Aren't you ""reacting"" to ""negative shit"" right now by responding to my post?

Aren't you labeling me right now by saying I'm a ""negative person"" because I said something you're not comfortable with?

Where are you looking to see the positive in this interaction? Have you so far? Because all I see is criticism. 

If you want to encourage me to be positive, the way to do that isnt to immediately label me a ""negative person"" because I said a word that made you uncomfortable and YOU deem as a highly offensive word. 

It's a big world with many cultures, so the fact that you chose to highlight this word like it's a problem (when historically, Disney was outwardly anti-Semitic, so I was being quite literal with the term) tells me that you don't have a full understanding of the perspective I'm bringing and are more focused on trying to ""win"" whatever this thread exchange has become.

You're choosing to be offended at something that was never directed at you so I am thoroughly puzzled at the length of your responses if you're currently showing me how to ""not react""

The ""hahahahaha"" responses don't read to me like those are ""non-reactions"" -- they read to me like you're being defensive about a response YOU chose to drop into my thread. If you're reading anything as passive aggressive, maybe consider that you could be projecting that?

I started this by posting what I posted, and I gave the forewarning that if you enjoyed the movie, or are easily offended to NOT read my post.

Again, not a passive aggressive statement, but people sometimes don't want to respect the warnings laid out for them, so I'm not mad that you're saying what you're saying, but if you can see from my perspective for a second... 

Can you see how confusing it is to me when you chose to ignore my warning, respond to my post, criticize me by accusing me of ""being a certain type of person"" based on a quote that you didn't originate... Only to then tell me that your whole point was to say ""hey, stop being a negative nancy, and try to look at the bright side?""

Sorry, I'm just not convinced that's where your heart was. I'm also not going to assume where it was at all, so if you are determined to label me instead of ""educate me"" like you claim you were attempting, but my ""low level thinking"" just couldn't comprehend it, then out of respect for your time, I will say thank you for sharing your opinions and passion to enforce others to remain positive and uncontroversial for your ease of living while you remain unchanged in your views.

Seriously, I have the time to burn, so we can keep going, but I'm sure you'd prefer to get back to your normal life since from what you're saying I should do, you have better things to do too rather than to put a reddit user in their place. 

If you don't, then I guess I'll see you back with another lesson to teach me soon. Either way, I appreciate your help! Thanks fam!! ❤",kkbd5s

For all we know he had come to the end of a long illness and didn't feel the need to fight his way back. Also, there's technically a loophole in that Joe is, as they would say in *The Princess Bride*, still only mostly dead. His body is still living, but obviously not in great shape and deeply unconscious. He's very close to death, but it looks like he wouldn't have actually died until he disappeared into the light.

gh4xx6y,"I'm not saying that Joe being black is racist, I was merely pointing out that if Joe, as a black man, was asked (by anyone other than a black person I guess) why he sounded like a middle-aged black man, the ramifications of that in a movie would result in severe criticism.  That's it.  That's all.  
 
Again, the quote would have been completely fine if Joe asked why 22 sounded like a middle-aged person instead of adding the white part unnecessarily.  I'm not saying that I believe that white women have annoying voices, not sure why you keep assuming multiple things in your argument.  22 answers the question directly to Joe; 22 does not need to elaborate (Edit: Explicitly state) that it is whiteness because it is part of the question.  English 101.  I'm saying that is what the movie is trying to stipulate.  Disagree with me all you want, this is how I understood her answer to his direct question.  That does not make me racist and that does not make me view white women as having annoying voices.  That is what I view the movie is making a joke at -- that a middle-aged white woman's voice 'works' as an annoying voice.  That's it.  It was a light-hearted, albeit slightly racist joke that implies 'Karenism'.",kkbd5s
gh4zfd3,"Also:  It may be his perception or illusion, but it is all part of the script that we, as the viewer, interpret and see.

1. He asks why 22 sounds like a middle-aged white lady
2. 22 says she could use an *angry/uptight* male voice, a child's voice, or Joe's own whiny voice (which we all know we would hate to hear ourselves hear.  Plus, she uses a different voice for all of these instances)
3. 22 returns to her own voice and says she uses it because it (*it* being the middle-aged white woman voice that she literally just returned to, please tell me how you can interpret it as any other way?!) annoys people.
4. Joe says it is very effective (Joe saying *IT's* very effective CONFIRMS that it is the middle-aged white lady voice he was asking about in his original question).

How do you not interpret this as anything but a racist joke against middle-aged white women?  Your argument isn't effective at all so don't come at me trying to say I don't have any valid points to my argument.",kkbd5s

gh4ldo6,“Why do you sound like a middle-aged white lady”. “I just use this voice because it annoys people”. There’s literally no reason why he asks that (as he doesn’t ask anyone else this question) outside of making a white person joke. And that’s unnecessary in a children’s movie.,kkbd5s

you are straight up gaslighting me, i don't believe for a second that you have watched this film 4 times. i only watched it a single time a week ago and these scenes stick out as so poorly placed and tonally jarring that i can't forget them. the first time joe tries to take 22 in the soul world to find a passion, they try food and baking, and both characters attempt to eat a pizza only to literally shit it out onto the floor behind them. 22 then straight up slaps joe across the face 20 times in a row. when 22 and joe are escaping the hospital, 22 adjusts his glasses and joe the cat jumps all over the place trying to catch the light. it's just such bottom tier humor that doesn't add anything to the film beyond slapstick 'hee hee look its a cat11!!1'.

there is nothing wrong with balancing serious subject matter with light-hearted humor, but the type of humor they choose to use is so inane and childish and it really detracts from the enjoyment of the film. moments like joe's mom saying ""we've got to get home, we old!"" is a legitimately funny moment that is sweet, characterizes their relationship, offers levity from the serious plot without dipping into baby humor.",kkbd5s

Depression is generally a combination of both psychological and physical factors. They both have a role to play. Possessions, family, wealth, fame, money, etc. have very little to do with keeping you from depression. For example, your body releases a chemical called serotonin when you are doing something that makes you happy. Serotonin caused your body to feel more relaxed, reduces anxiety, and causes you to feel happy. If you have a chemical imbalance in your head, say from a lack of serotonin, then you will feel sad, more anxious, less focused, etc. This is depression at the most basic level. There are thousands of other factors, and they have proven to be very difficult to control.  

I see that you’re trying to understand depression through your own values and morals. That’s understandable. What you may not understand is that we all have different personalities and values. What makes you tick may not interest me at all, and vice versa. Robin Williams had a family. Kurt Cobain had wealth. Chester Bennington had fame.",kkbd5s

So ... Nobody is saying it should be about race. I'm saying that everything can (should) be seen through a racial prism and be talked about critically. It's not an act of judgement. I'm not saying ""it's bad"" or ""it's good"". I'm saying that some dynamics are existing here. And ignoring them is a faulty behaviour.
White saviourism is one of them (Greenbook, Django, The Help, Hidden Figures, Avatar, etc etc). A white director using Black culture as a mean to fill-in his project is another dynamic. The race does not have to matter *in* the film, to be talked about *on* the film. Again, I replied to someone that said ""I'm happy we're not talking about race in the comments"".  

Also, critically talking race doesn't involve my personal feelings, dunno why I have to say that. I'm not from the USA, I know what is it to be shown a Black experience that isn't even remotely close to mine. But that does not cloud my (attempt at) understanding of the *dynamics*. 

I'm also aware of the point of the movie isn't to show all the Black trauma. But the movie does not exist in a vacuum, viewers are to be included when one talks about dynamics. And I simply pointed that. Black joy (not depicted in this movie) is systematically denied and the first random that goes into a Black body get to enjoy life. In the absolute sense, it's horrible. You can relativise, I do too. However, it's difficult to not point out the socio-economic hurdles that Black people are meeting on their way to their purpose, an obvious example from the movie is (not racially exclusive but it still hits harder) : You don't have means to eat and sleep if you don't have a job. You don't have healthcare if you're not a full-timer. 

> It can't be both? 

No.  Why would something that is *specifically made* to protect Black folks would also cater to white folks, the ultra-majority ? Was Blaxploitation for us or for them ?

>Other endings showed what happened to 22, who isn’t seen again after their soul descends to Earth. But every time they thought up an epilogue for 22, they changed their minds. Powers said, “There was one where Joe was touring with Dorothea and teaching students privately on the side, and 22 was a new student and he recognized that it was her.”

>The filmmakers decided “there was something innately not satisfying about it” so they chose to leave 22’s life a mystery.

>One post-credits sequence they considered would have shown what happened to Mr. Mittens, the cat whose body Joe possesses for most of the movie.

>Ultimately, they decided that showing the futures of the characters went against the message of the film, which delves into living for the little moments and the sometimes unsatisfying nature of achieving a dream.

>“We know that audiences often want to be told exactly what happened to the character,” Powers told USA Today. “They want to know that the character made the ‘right’ decision. But in the case of Joe, we didn’t want to put a choice on him. We wanted to say that regardless of what he ended up doing, whether it was going back to teaching, playing in a band, or some hybrid of both, he just appreciated life better.”

""It's the little things"" was the message they landed on at the end, but the vast majority of the movie was basically the opposite of that and two characters learn this lesson by the end ... one of which will then be born and forget that they learned it. The Jerry are perpetually churning out souls with personality defects that will make them unable to appreciate the little things, or outright making the life experiences of other souls worse.

gh87df0,">He spends his whole life chasing his dream of being a musician, but doesn’t realise the meaning his life offered to those around him through his teaching, whether it’s Connie, Curly, or 22.

Where in the movie did he have this realization?

If you go back and watch the epiphany scene he had at his piano while looking at all the little things 22 collected over the day (and during a musical track literally titled ""Epiphany""), that epiphany was not about teaching.  It was about riding his bike through the park, playing his music, interacting with his mom, teaching Curly, watching fireworks, standing in the ocean, and eating a piece of pecan pie.  These were all his greatest hits.  His epiphany was that there were lots of things that made his life fulfilling--not one true purpose or meaning.  Having him replace his One True Purpose of professional jazz music with a One True Purpose of mentoring would be antithetical to the message of the story, which is why there's nothing in the movie to suggest to us that that's what Joe is doing.  And why there's an explicit exchange that goes (emphasis mine):

>Joe:  We never found out what 22's purpose was.  
>  
>Jerry:  Excuse me?  
>  
>Joe: You know, her spark.  Her purpose.  Was it music?  Biology? Walking?  
>  
>Jerry:  **We don't assign purposes**\--where did you get that idea?  
>  
>Joe: Because I have piano.  It's what I was born to do--it's my purpose.  
>  
>Jerry:  A spark isn't a soul's purpose.  Oh you mentors and your passions. Your purposes.  Your meanings of life.  So basic.

So yes--the message is that there is no inherent meaning or purpose to someone's life, and we see through the story of Joe and also 22 that focusing very strongly on the purpose or meaning of life can actually be detrimental to recognizing all of the things that are actually making our lives fulfilling.  It's okay not to like that message, but I think there's a lot more evidence to support that as the main message than there is for the main message being about the power of teaching or finding purpose in teaching (imo if either of those were *supposed* to be the main themes of Soul then it actually failed spectacularly). There are lots of good movies with the message that your impact on the earth is about inspiring other people--It's a Wonderful Life and Mr. Holland's Opus both come to mind.  Soul is not thematically set up like that.  It's not an inspirational teaching movie or a ""look at the impact you had on all the people around you"" movie.",kkbd5s
gh8tw0n,"I did not get that his purpose was teaching at all. It was a misdirection otherwise it would've been much more heavy handed in the end that he was teaching and he wouldn't continue pursuing music as a career.

His whole epiphany was that there is more to life than just a singular purpose. He got what he wanted and it wasn't enough because his entire life was focused on getting the one thing and when he got it he had a lot of other parts of his life missing. He was alone after the show. It wasn't until he started looking into remembering the smaller moments through the mementos that 22 had collected. His purpose on life wasn't to be a musician since purpose itself doesn't have meaning.

Life is about the journey and if you're not careful it'll pass by in an instant. The journey is about struggle, love, pain, growth, and connection. He focused so much on the end destination that he didn't live his life. The barber is a great example about what it means to find purpose in life. He didn't do the thing he was passionate about but found connection with people through his work or craft. I highly suggest learning more about Eudaimonia which is about flourishing. The goal is to flourish in your crafts, in your relationships with people, and improve your life situation because no matter how great your life is you will adapt to it. If your life is shit and you don't try to improve it will stay shitty and you won't go anywhere. The struggle and growth is key here.

The epiphany was that there is no singular purpose but how you view your world. If you only think it's bad it will be bad for you. If you only think it's good you'll miss out on the signs that things aren't good and you won't improve. Lost souls have lost themselves in their obsessions and can't see anything outside of it. 22 was obsessed with finding a purpose that she couldn't look beyond that. The guy at a soul crushing jobs was obsessed with just doing the work to make money and when it finally hits them that there is more to life than the grind is when they started living. 

I think he has goals and crafts. Reaching people through music is his goal and craft. He saw being a professional musician as a purpose rather than a goal he's working towards. There is a difference between the two.

I too learned this lesson the hard way as a musician. I toured, produced for big name artists, and travelled the world but I wasn't happy. I loved doing it and while I was doing it I was in the zone but once I got home I felt alone. It wasn't until I focused on connecting with people and taking things slower by walking around, enjoying the small moments instead of seeking out the next high, that I truly started enjoying life. Now I've started slowly going back to music and the fulfillment I get out of it is for myself and not for extrinsic validation.",kkbd5s

ghf4qc7,"Gotcha. 

I don't hate your version of the ending, but personally, I think it does speak strongly that Joe needed to actually achieve his dream for him to wake up.

And his relationships were not great imo.

His relationship with his mom was active, but it wasnt until 22 got involved that the two had a genuine conversation.

His relationship with his barber was superficial until 22 got involved and helped Joe 'see' that he wasn't the only one with dreams.

And even with Connie, he has to be reminded about the value that he brings to her.

Joe's lack of engagement with the world is probably best symbolized by the unseen Lisa, who represents intimacy.

However, Joe was unable to be intimate with anybody because he was busy chasing his dream.

I understand your logic, but if the people closest to him werent able to jolt Joe's mind, then I dont see how 22 would have been.

He needed to finally achieve his goal for him to finally realize, ""this can't be the only thing I live for.""",kkbd5s

I don't think he was lost but just missing the bigger picture. Passion is an amazing thing to have and can help a lot of people overcome a lot of obstacles. Not everyone can let their passion pay the bills and even when they do they sometimes have to compromise to make it happen, look at the barber. He made the most out of the moment he's in and enjoys it.

There's a great Greek word called Eudaimonia. It basically means happiness or welfare, or in more accurate terms flourishing. It's often used in Positive Psychology. It's all about ones well-being and that means one needs to be flourishing in their craft, having strong bonds with people, and living with the virtues (or aretes) that are best for them. It's about the journey and the constant effort into flourishing within your means and striving for more. The problem again with Joe was he made his passion the most important thing that he missed out on the other parts that are important to ones subjective well being and that included his bonds and his virtues.

How???? Because the main character whose black isn't happy? It's kind of hard to have a movie if the protagonist is already satisfied with their life. Luke Skywalker wasn't satisfied with his life as a moisture farmer, and he met someone like Han who did seem to enjoy his different life, but was kind of a jerk.

Do you realize that other black characters are shown in the film, and they are shown as happy like the barber guy?

>In the absolute sense, it's horrible.

>However, it's difficult to not point out the socio-economic hurdles that Black people are meeting on their way to their purpose, an obvious example from the movie is (not racially exclusive but it still hits harder) : You don't have means to eat and sleep if you don't have a job.

ghgcg0m,"> I hear a lot of spiritual teachers talking about us all being one but I never quite understood that. 

Yeah, it's a super pervasive spiritual concept that didn't really ""click"" with me for a long time either. There's the classic ""one with everything"" phrase in Buddhism, but for a long time I took this to be a philosophical thing about how everything is interconnected and how we all had the same ultimate origin in the Big Bang (not that either of these things are untrue, but the concept goes deeper!).

What I didn't believe was the idea that consciousness is anything but a product of chemical interactions in the physical world. The idea that consciousness gave rise to matter -- rather than the other way around -- seemed laughable.

But consider a dream in which you assume some different identity. Maybe you're a different gender, or a different person altogether. When you wake up from the dream, in the physical world, there is no doubt that the dream identity was the illusion and your physical identity is the real one.

Similarly, with a spiritual awakening, there is a remembrance that one's true, core identity is a universal flow of conscious energy that breathes life into organic matter. This universal conscious energy is who (or ""what"") you really are, fundamentally; the human experience is more analogous to an illusory dream state.

Just as it's possible to become lucid during a dream (knowing that it's a dream), it's possible to become spiritually ""lucid"" during a physical lifetime, knowing that one's core essence (i.e., consciousness itself) is immortal. This experience is classically called ""enlightenment,"" ""illumination"" or ""awakening.""

> I think that’s interesting that DMT helped in shifting that.

So, everything in the last part of my message might seem totally crazy to you. It certainly seemed crazy to me at one point! The reason that all this stuff isn't self-evident is because you have a ""veil"" between your conscious mind and this universal spring of conscious energy that's constantly flowing into everyone's psyche. Psychedelics have the effect of weakening this veil. In the case of DMT, you can break through it entirely (""piercing the veil"").

Doing psychedelics is not a guarantee of spiritual enlightenment. I used DMT, LSD and mushrooms for a while and still retained my atheism and mechanistic outlook. But every time I did them, in hindsight, a little bit more of my ego peeled away. I became increasingly aware of my own faulty thought processes and behavioral patterns. The dross of my ego was gradually burned away more and more with each trip, until eventually the pathways were open, so to speak.

People achieve the exact same thing with disciplined meditation, and some people experience something very similar with near-death experiences. I would assert, though, that everyone is constantly getting closer and closer to this big realization during their mundane everyday lives, even if they're making no efforts toward ""truth-seeking"" or spiritual unfoldment.

Psychedelics can speed up this universal process, but they're not without their risks. Lifting up the veil and allowing the universe's raw consciousness to flow into your mind can lead to delusions and insanity as your brain struggles to interpret it. There's a reason that occultism (which is also the same basic thing I'm talking about) has associations with insanity -- the H.P. Lovecraftian monsters that manifest in our minds when we gaze into infinity, as if staring directly at a spiritual sun.

All right, I'm getting weird now, haha, but I'll try to wrap this up with a quote from the poet Rumi: ""You are not a drop in the ocean. You are the entire ocean in a drop.""

The very idea of *consciousness itself* is *fundamentally what you are*. ""All is mind,"" as the occult maxim goes -- we're all basically stumbling around inside of God's imagination, artificially veiled from each other's minds (and our own true identities), but this veil is not 100% opaque; we can catch glimpses through it, and sometimes it lifts at just the right time in just the right way for us to remember what we fundamentally are outside of a human incarnation.

Anyway, I don't know if this is helpful or not, but I felt compelled to share! I'm happy to answer any further questions or provide any elaborations if you'd like, but otherwise I'll leave you with one final thought...

> I’ve never tried psychedelics but I’ve been curious of what the experience is like

It's impossible to accurately describe in words -- how do you describe a colorful painting to someone who's been blind from birth, or the smell of food without referencing other smells/tastes?

While everyone's experience is different, it's my current view that if you go deeply enough with it, there is a universal core to the experience that reveals everything I'm telling you now to be self-evident. However, I would strongly caution against experimenting with psychedelics until you're truly ready. You'll know you're ready when you *really really* want it. That's definitely where I was. If you don't *really really* want it, then there's a good chance that the experience would be of no value (or perhaps even actively detrimental) to you at this time.",kkbd5s

He found meaning in other things too, like his dad listening to him play music, him eating the pie in the restaurant, the times he spent with 22. But where I’m coming from in my OP is that I don’t have something like teaching to fall back on like Joe does. That’s why I’m focussing on it. It could’ve been anything. It could’ve been building instruments, it could’ve been tending a venue, it could’ve been working in a studio recording other artists while he watched others achieving their dreams.

And I also disagree with it being anything close to white savior or Magical Negro, as neither follow the tropes. Yes, Joe a black man, helps a pre-born soul, that does not make him a magical negro because his character is just as developed, and he only acts in 22's interest at the end of the film, the movie is still largely about his learning experience. 

It definitely isn't a white savior film because 22 isn't even white, but even if she was, she's not portrayed as more competent than him. She does talk to the barber and get people to listen, but she's still ultimately ""the load"" during the movie, she just ends up being a bit more helpful.

The white savior trope is bad because it depicts white characters as the ones doing all the work, and puts them in the spotlight. That is not Kevin Costner and the film still isn't a white savior film because his character isn't put in the spotlight nor is he treated as the big hero. Yes he contributes, but the black women are the ones shown as doing all the hard work and fighting the struggle.

I'd only say Hidden Figures was a white savior film, if Costner was the main character and the movie was ""white man saves defenseless black women and helps them survive in Nasa"" instead of ""Black women were the real heroes during that space launch, and oh yeah, this white guy helped a bit"".

When I mentioned the horrible thing, I stripped out the context. If you're re-adding Joey in, it's not going to make much sense. Cause even if he acts in 22's interest only at the end, it's at its expense, which is one of the components of the magical Negro. The formula isn't strict, the trop isn't followed, but we still can see the dynamics around. Same for white saviour trope. It's never about ""the dude does all the work"", it's about **centering** him in a story that **impact** someone else (specifically colonised people, in the larger sense) while he's only **gaining** recognition, fame, entertainment, etc. Note that recognition isn't necessary from the in-universe characters but also come from the viewers.

Okay, explain to me how Jamie Foxx’s character describing 22’s voice as the voice of ‘a middle aged white lady’ in the form of a question in any way implies that he thinks “all white ladies sound the same”???

Observing that a person’s voice sounds like a white women’s voice in this context is not insulting all white women. I’m baffled at this. Perhaps if he was... insulting her voice somehow??? I think it’s very reasonable for the character of Joe to be confused at how this vague, cerebral spirit baby sounds like Tina Fey. He asks this question with confusion and skepticism because of the situation. I find it very clear that there’s no ill-intent or menace in his delivery. 

And 22 describing her own voice as “annoying” doesn’t mean all white women sound the same. White women are a broad-ass category of voices, my dude.

Now here’s the thing: I KNOW you know that all white women don’t sound the same. You’ve said so yourself, by nature of the fact that you have a bone to pick with that perspective. And you are absolutely convinced that this movie is guilty of exhibiting that belief, and I just do not see the evidence for that here.

I’m order for the movie to be saying that all women sound annoying, this movie would have to say so more explicitly. At best, they say that 22 chose the voice that they found (Tina Fey’s) was most effective at annoying people. 

It seems the problem here is that you are assuming malevolent intent into this joke situation that simply does not have it. You seem to be pretty convicted of this, so I’m afraid I’m not sure what else to say.",kkbd5s

They added a whole arc of going to the toilets to sanctify that dude, ""oh he saved her the hassle and gave her recognition, what a good guy"". 

I don't think that was the point. I mean ultimately it was white guys who had to sign off segregation, as they were in charge, but that doesn't mean if it's included in a civil rights movement that it means its making them the heroes.

Like when it comes to changes that actually happened, although it black people who had to fight and they deserve the credit, it was still white people who ultimately have to make it official. The only way for it to only be black people, is if we did a whole takeover like how Malcolm initially wanted. We didn't do that, we found ways to communicate to issues in the country, protested and all that, and it was the white people who signed the papers like how despite it being Katherine who had to go back and forth across the bathroom, it's the white guys word that ultimately sticks, so for Katherine to make progress, she convinces the white guy.

I'm not trying to go and say that white guys were the real heroes, they weren't, but rather, that's just how it worked, it wouldn't make any sense if it was Katherine who did what her boss did, because she would get arrested and the sign would just be put back up.

The toilet arc was to show her struggle. And when she breaks down her experience it nudges something in the old man causing a change to happen. It was still Katherine Johnson who had to bring it up. There was no other way for that sign to go down unless it was a white who did it, but it was still the black people who have to fight for change.

> That's centering him in a story that should center Mary Jackson.

How is that centering when he's far from the protagonist? Yeah the white guy in charge did two nice things, so? His primary role is being Katherine's boss, and two times he throws her a bone. That is nowhere near a white savior movie. The movie isn't about him helping black people, the black characters are clearly shown as the ones who do the work, and it's about them figuring out how to get a man in space while facing the struggles of being black. Part of that struggle could contain a white guy that throws a bone, that doesn't negate that the film is ultimately about what they themselves can accomplish.

>Cause even if he acts in 22's interest only at the end, it's at its expense, which is one of the components of the magical Negro. 

But he ultimately doesn't, because he's given a second chance. He's nowhere near a magical negro. Magical Negroes aren't the main character.

> It's never about ""the dude does all the work"", it's about centering him in a story that impact someone else (specifically colonised people, in the larger sense) while he's only gaining recognition, fame, entertainment, etc. Note that recognition isn't necessary from the in-universe characters but also come from the viewers. It does not have to be ""big"" either.

But he is in the center of the story, and he gives a positive impact on a pre-baby while also gaining something for himself. He is not a magical negro. A magical negro is the wise black character who spends all his screen time helping the white or giving advice. In this film, Joe is also the one going on a personal journey and his journey is put first.

>I thought it was obvious, but the concept of a raceless individual in a racialised world is antinomic. The default is set by those who racialise. And Black folks in NYC are never going to be the default (unless the american settler state vanishes)

ghbfnct,"I didn’t want to actually write out what I think because most of you people who write long winded, typo filled, reddit comments are usually really awful at arguing and even worse at having a productive discussion. But you said that I couldn’t, so now I have to write this while I eat my lunch.

First of all: We need to establish if we’re talking about the film’s themes or actual quality as a piece of film. I could go either way on the quality. It was somewhat boring and the art wasn’t nearly as good as coco. But it was still pixar. So i still enjoyed it.

Debating the actual message of the film, “Life is what you make it” I disagree with whatever notion you’re trying to make. Something about the government and inequality? Poverty exists, therefore life isn’t worth living? If 22 became a homeless person, she shouldn’t live? Does that imply that homeless people should kill themselves? It comes off as so privileged to not even be able to imagine poor people being able to be happy. It shows a massive misunderstanding of what happiness is. Yes. Poor people need help. Yes, poverty is a huge problem in the world. They don’t just sit around all day slitting their wrists, though. They love and have families and experience life the same as everyone does. If you want to talk about equal access to resources, then I’m all aboard the wealth redistribution train, but to imply that their lives are 100% misery is built off of that first world savior complex that causes everyone to think that a family in the Caribbean without air conditioning and internet must be miserable. Spoiler alert: They’re not. They’re struggling, they’ve got shit to deal with, but they’re capable of living a happy life.

I really hate hate hate the idea that anything “idealizes life” as though life is this thing to be avoided. Fuck you. Are you on team “life is garbage”? Then fucking kill yourself, dude. It’s not “smell the roses and look at the trees and you’ll be happy!” That’s not what it was getting at. 22 was debating on existing at all. The small things are actually big things if you take the time to savor them. Joe was taking them for granted, that’s why he called them “just boring old life.” He expected the moment he got to play jazz in a huge gig to be the moment his life felt complete. It wasn’t. Life isn’t a maze where you turn left or right. Life is a little ride that you get into and eventually ends.

The truth is (and your ignorance on this idea means you need to read more Sartre) life is what you make it. The point of the movie is that, yes, life is suffering. Life is disappointing and there is sadness and pain and loss. But outside of that is nothingness. I don’t know if you’ve ever contemplated killing yourself or not, but it’s scary because you think it’s a good trade to feel nothing forever instead of feeling bad. It’s not a good trade. One day you are going to die and you will stop feeling anything forever. All of your senses will go numb and you will never see anyone you love ever again. That will happen no matter what. Not only will you cease feeling, there will no longer be any you to feel. The reason these people who’ve lived in poverty all of their lives, lived under oppressive governments, or have always been miserable stay alive at all is because the little moments do make it worthwhile to be alive. People have survived hardships you couldn’t imagine. People survived the holocaust, American slavery, genocide, war, purely on willpower. African slaves who were dragged to the colonies at gun point could’ve just killed themselves and abandoned life because that’s what life became. And many did. But the ones who didn’t kept going because they knew that they or their descendants would be free. And that the moments where they COULD be happy were worth it. You cite that 22 could be someone who can’t afford pizza. But that person could also be someone who holds out for the day they can. That’s what hope is. That’s what that is, you miserable shit.

There once was a man who fell off a cliff while being chased by coyotes. He managed to grab a branch on the way down. At the bottom of the cliff, below him, was another pack of hungry coyotes. The branch began to slip from his grasp. On the branch was a small, dark berry. The man took the berry and placed it in his mouth. As his grasp slipped and death became certain, that berry was the sweetest thing he’d ever tasted.

No race was left behind or got ahead, this is NOT an argument.

I don't care who cops have to shoot or kill if it is needed to keep the public safe. I'm makeing a statement because this is BLMs bigger claims that cops treat them unfair and that black are killed more often than whites.

ghblxtq,"You continue to fail to understand my statement man. Ive literally even quoted what 22 has said herself in the movie. 

You keep saying that its supposed to be just enjoying the small moments. But I literally already told you that you can be grateful for the things around you and still be depressed. This is a bad form of messaging. Unlike inside out which told the viewer that its okay to be sad, to not try to force yourself to be happy. This movie just throws that message out the window and just tells you ""think happy thoughts and you'll be happy"". That's not how it works. If it was we wouldn't have our depression rates being the highest in our generation than any other in the past. If it was that easy we wouldn't have the highest suicide rate either. 

I'm going to bring back what I said about 22. She literally called out the school system. Why would anyone choose to live on earth when its basically a lottery, hoping you obtain a liveable life? The souls seem comfortable in the great before, they also have personalities so its not like they're empty shells. This goes back to your argument about finding ""existence"" in life. 22 already had a life in the great before, she said it herself. If she was paired up with a homeless man in a shelter would she still have the same spark for living? You pass this up as if it's not a valid argument but it 100% is. Sorry to upset you this much. I know its hard to use your brain to form all this sentences. 

For someone who supposedly knows the ""meaning of life"" you are really a asshole bitch who would tell someone to go kill themselves just because they're depressed. Its not that we're ""fuck the world, the world is garbage"" its that if you're trying to make a film with this adult themes and thoughts. At least be truthful about life. 22 literally called Joes life meaningless and sad. She even says she doesn't understand the big deal about earth. If it's literally just a lottery. You can't just be living and expect a roof over your head.

Call me racist for it because that’s what you SJW people do when people have a differing opinion than you when people crack white jokes. I’m done talking to you because you are serving no value in this conversation 👋",kkbd5s
gh5l1i2,"Sorry I forgot to reply. You see I **also** send seven consecutive comments to my opponents when I get into arguments on the internet. Your input is very important to me, I just lost track of time, it happens. 

Speaking as a white trans woman, I find a very soft joke making fun of “karenism” as you described very, *very* harmless. Karenism is very obviously not an inherent or biological trait of white people. It’s the result of people who are very entitled lashing out and punching either laterally or down at others they see as below them, most often the latter. If you are knowledgeable and intelligent enough to interpret that cultural subtext, surely you can understand that.

In other words, I don’t see this as an example of racism because the behavior implicitly being critiqued is clearly the result of a power imbalance. It is entitlement and ego. Not to mention that *most white people are aware of and also very critical of this phenomenon!* You might notice there aren’t a ton of people around that share this sentiment. Chalk that up to reddit’s demographics if you want, that’s very fair. But I personally doubt a storm’s-a-brewing over this.

Now on your other point: “You can’t have a self-deprecating jab in an animated scripted movie.” That’s a very fair observation! You may have this point on me. However, I do believe I saw a section of about four people listed in the credits for script input, or something like that. (It definitely wasn’t called that *verbatim,* but the exact title escapes me. Sorry about that.) 

I’m making the assumption (forgive me for making assumptions, I am not an exact being of flawless knowledge gathering capabilities) that Tina Fey, as the known talent and comedian that she is, had some small amount of pull or power over her lines. After all, it’s a small, throwaway joke with no real plot relevance, although the characters’ control over their physical form, appearance, and presentation makes for a fun fantasy background detail. Now, if my assumption here is true, I find that rather fascinating! 

Now, sufficiently talented people or celebrities with enough clout having some about of influence over their lines is not totally unheard of, to me. An extreme example would be Robin Williams improvising a huge amount of his comic material in *Alladin,* although admittedly that is an extreme example. I’m absolutely sure there are some examples of this that are far more subtle than that! And if I were working on this film and we had the great Tina Fey working with me, I would be *thrilled* to have her input here and there, even if in admittedly small doses given the scale of a production like this.

Hey speaking of scale, I’m fairly sure that no matter how diverse the staff of this film was, there were probably plenty of middle-aged white women who at the very least gave this joke a once-over and thought it was fine. I think people of the demographic you believe are being victimized here understand that they aren’t the targets of this joke, as I explained earlier. *Middle-aged white women* find Karens annoying! It’s a broadly observed cultural phenomenon. And besides, I still think the interpretation of this joke as a broad condemnation of middle-aged white women is a little shortsighted. The Karen interpretation that you made above is very fair, admittedly. But if you make the connection to the outside issue of “karenism” as a viewer, then it is really your responsibility to understand the nuance here. It rests in the eye of the beholder.

That is to say, you shouldn’t say this is a reference to Karenism without putting “Karenism” in the proper context!

And finally, about how you couldn’t make the reverse joke about Jamie Foxx being black or whatever. *Of course if would be racist to make the joke then.* **Because the context has changed now!** Have you heard of “punching up” versus “punching down” in comedy? It’s not an earth-shattering observation to make note of the potential of a double-standard! They exist! In this situation, there’s not even a *reason* to call attention to Joe having the voice of a black man! He’s a material, living black man who has lived, and is now embodying a spirit form. 22 having characteristics such as that of of the voice of a middle-aged white woman very much stand out, as she is supposed to be someone who has not yet been born and contrasts **greatly** with the rest of the unborn residents of the You Seminar! How come all of these abstract, cerebral, cloudy puffballs sound like the same nonspecific pre-school child, while this one over here sounds like an adult white woman for some reason?! It is entirely in-character for this Joe character to ask that question like that. Joe calling attention to this unexpected characteristic of this character, in this situation, in this manner is not racist.

...wow. That was a lot of typing I did for one comment. Kinda wish I put that into an essay or an editorial commenting on representing abstract characters and entities with voice actors and the (often difficult or in-vain) tribulations of disentangling race, gender, age, or other qualities from cerebral and intentionally generic/plain/featureless characters like that.

You, presumably a middle aged person, are not impressionable to jokes of this nature because you understand the lightheartedness and can take it at face value, since you know who Tina Fey is and her type of humor.
