esn05eu,im guessing that pelle's parents sacraficed themselves in the yellow house and that's how they died? and that's why his brother did it? they have a queen and a yellow house burns down every summer right or just every 90 years that part was unclear to me,c7y18a
esnc3zp,"Somebody please tell me if I'm looking too much into it, but...

I thought it was interesting that Pelle described life as 4 seasons, with spring being birth/childhood and winter being old age/death. If I'm not wrong, the movie begins in winter with the death of her family and the midsommar festival takes place at the end of spring, yes? Is this supposed to be... rebirth into her new ""family""? I dunno.

Edit: yeah so it definitely is summer by the time of the festival I guess. For some reason I thought somebody said it ended on the summer solstice. There was a lot of stuff to pay attention to, I got distracted lol.",c7y18a
esn4lij,"The only hereditary-esque moment for me where I just felt like I was being gripped by something awful was the beginning when we see suddenly see what has become of Dani's family.

esnqw05,"I know a lot of people are praising its cinematography, but I gotta give a shout-out to the sound design team. Very little ambient sounds - lots of scenes almost feel like people are talking in a vacuum.

And then ambience picks up again when they trip. Something I bet a lot of folks may not notice but a subconsciously effective way of inciting general unease.

EDIT: Another thing I forgot to mention was that because of the intentionally minimalistic sound design/mixing combined with using multiple channels for dialogue in a lot of scenes, whenever i heard whispering I’d freak out - only to realize it was a couple or whomever whispering to each other in the theater.",c7y18a

esodcue,"Does anyone else have a take on the mirror motif? There are at least half a dozen shots where characters are framed through their reflection in a mirror. They're always looking at someone else -- which could be interpreted as a failure to introspect. When Christian is inside the bear at the end, they say something to the effect of ""reflect on your wickedness."" The exception to this being during Dani's bad trip, when seeing her own reflection snaps her out of it.

There's also the psychological concept of [mirroring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirroring_\(psychology\)) -- something the Harga do to empathize with and comfort one another.

I saw Christian's major flaw as refusing to believe Dani. He is chronically unsupportive and challenges Dani every chance he gets. The Harga, on the other hand, are empathetic to the extreme. When Dani is crying on the floor of the cabin with the women surrounding her, they are quite literally *mirroring* her pain. I think for the first time, Dani sees herself in another person. And the events that follow make perfect sense.

TL;DR mirrors are a metaphor for empathy",c7y18a
esnidp6,"One of my favorite parts was in the prologue during Dani and Christian’s argument about his plans to leave for the festival.

The most jarring thing about the cult was them juxtaposed with all the outsiders.

Pelle describes the loss of his family, and how the commune is his family and his family is his home. Dani has lost her family and this has lost her home much like Dorothy. The difference is she chooses to stay in her version of Oz.

Here we go.

All the **Flower Symbols** in *Midsommar* (so far):

* The flowered ""i"" in Ari Aster's name during the credits is a flower called an aster
* Maja (the redhead) wore striped carnation flowers in her floral wreath. Carnations usually represent pure love. HOWEVER, *striped* carnations represent a love that cannot be shared (\*cough\* \*cough\*)
* I *think* Dani's wreath was made up of primroses, which represent young love (specifically the sentiment of not being able to live without a partner, which usually comes with young love). To be completely honest, though, her flower was the most difficult to figure out, and I'm still not really sure what it is exactly
* We don't actually see Pelle's wreath until the end, when it is revealed that he was bringing his friends so that they might be ""sacrifices"" to fulfill the ritual. However, he also brought in outsiders in order to expand the gene pool, so to speak, and to prevent everyone from eventually becoming inbred.... his wreath was made of pine branches. Pine tends to represent wisdom, fertility, and longevity...
* Also: Dani gives a bundle of what appears to be Goldenrods to Christian. Goldenrods usually represent encouragement and growth, and are often given to show support for someone after a loss or when they're going through a difficult time (basically given to people to help with depression). My best guess is that this is supposed to be ironic, since he should probably be giving those to her.
* I have yet to figure out which flowers were placed in Simon's eyes in the chicken coup.
* It's also worth noting that Odd (one of the old men; the guy who blows a bunch of shit into Christian's face in the chicken coup) is wearing a unique wreath -- it's mostly made up of some kind of leaf, but I can't figure out what it is.

P.S. I'm not a botanist or florist (in fact I don't really know much about flowers at all), so take all this with a grain of salt. I mostly just noticed the pattern after watching the credits and wanted to do a little bit of research on it (don't steal my thesis, *\*wink\* \*wink\**).

**EDIT**: Sooo after watching it a second time, I don’t know how much of all this *actually* holds up. Most of the flowers I mentioned aren’t as unique to the characters as I previously thought (a lot of them actually have the same flowers too), so I think I overestimated their significance as a whole.... The little bouquet Dani gave to Christian appears to be a whole bunch of different flowers, Pelle’s wreathe is actually made of ferns (not pine), Maya’s flower (striped carnation) is in a whole bunch of other wreaths, etc., etc., etc.... BUT I’m positive about the aster in Ari Aster’s credit at the very least...",c7y18a

Hereditary had horror/plot elements that were typical horror (murder, ghosts, witchcraft etc). It's heavy on the ""what is fucking happening"" whereas Midsommar  felt like ""why the fuck is this happening"". 


Aster definitely made it easy to see WHAT was going to happen next (the pubic period quilt is the most obvious example). Aside from the elder couple's suicide, the movie was light on gore/seeing death. 

We don't see Connie and Simon die but the audience already knows that. The only surprise is how they repurpose the bodies.",c7y18a

esooq2y,"Both with Hereditary and now Midsommar, Ari Aster does something very unique in horror.  He showcases death without escape.  In many horror movies, the death/violence occurs by a creature, supernatural force, stupidity, etc.  As a result, when the death occurs you direct your anger, frustration, feelings toward the trigger.  You want the creature to be stopped, you want the killer to be caught, you blame the people for being too stupid.  In Hereditary and Midsommar both there are a moments of death where there is no escape.  Hereditary Spoilers Tagged In Case: >!Charlie's death in Hereditary is, before knowledge is provided later, really a series of bad coincidences that lead to an awful tragedy.  There's perhaps some little blame that can be placed here or there and that comes out in the dinner scene, but in the end it's a tragedy.!< The two old members of the community in Midsommar made a choice and we must accept it unflinchingly.

On the surface, this just looks like Christian being less invested in the relationship. But thematically, it has a different meaning. 6 months is the difference between solstices, and is especially significant in places that experience midnight sun (because the opposite also occurs!)

4 years earlier was summer. Summer is learning and journeying, and ultimately life. To Dani, their relationship is alive and ongoing. Dani ends up alive.

3.5 years earlier was winter. Winter is death. To Christian, their relationship is ending. He wears dark colors when everyone else is wearing white. He ends up dead.",c7y18a

In both cases, death is inevitable, and both feature horrific murders and suicides (the sister killing the parents and herself is not that different from the cult's final murder/suicide fire ritual). The difference is that in the world outside the cult, pain is suppressed (Dani excusing herself to the bathroom whenever she feels grief), while in the cult, pain is not only shared (Dani sobbing in unison with the other women after catching Christian cheating) but ritualized. From the cult's perspective, if death and pain are inevitable, better to shine a harsh light on them (literally!) and see them clearly, no matter how gruesome that process might be. And while the outside world fails in guiding both the sister and Dani through their pain, Dani is able to find some peace in the cult by bringing her pain into the light.",c7y18a
i3rba9j,"This is one of my favourite movies.  It frustrates me to read commentary on it, because I feel as if most people don't ""get"" it, and their not ""getting it"" is kinda what the movie is about.

This is not a movie about a failing relationship, or a cult.  This is a movie about surviving trauma, and the profound disconnect that occurs between the people who are surviving it, and the people around them who don't understand what they're going through.

As far as I'm concerned, the only sequence in this film that truly constituted ""horror"" was the opening sequence, where Dani's sister kills herself and her parents.  It is made very clear that Dani is empathetic toward her bipolar sister, and her own studies in psychology suggest a desire to engage with mental health as a whole.

It is made clear, chillingly so, the dynamic between Dani and Christian right off the bat, with Christian telling Dani that her bipolar sister is just ""doing it for attention"" and that Dani encourages her behaviour.  This same lack of understanding about mental health struggles would define Christian's behaviour for the rest of the film.

I've read here and elsewhere the theory that Christian is a ""bad boyfriend"".  It's missing the point.  He's not a bad boyfriend.  He occupies the same space that so many people occupy when they are in relationships with, or adjacent to, people recovering from trauma or other mental health issues.  He is profoundly uncomfortable, he is split between ""wanting to help his partner"" and also ""feeling overstretched"".

Pelle was so encouraging of Dani to come to the festival because Pelle knew, explicitly, that the cult was going to be able to provide Dani with better tools to recover from her trauma.  It's made so clear, the way the women in the cult scream along with Dani when she's sad, laugh along with her when she's happy.  The cult is with her, emotionally, willing to feel all the same awful feelings Dani is feeling.

Dani's eventual decision to have Christian burned was not punishment, it was not revenge.  It was survival.  The trauma of losing her sister and parents was destroying her life.  The cult had shown her communal support and release from that trauma.  Sacrificing Christian was the final step she needed to take to sever ties with her previous, traumatized state.

There are multiple scenes in the movie where Dani cries, or is on the verge of tears.  She cries on the phone in the face of Christian's indifference.  She has to break off her conversation with Pelle to cry in the bathroom.  She cries in the airplane.  She steps away from the group upon arriving at Halsingland to cry.  Trauma defines this woman's life, and would destroy her if she didn't find a way to escape from it.

The scene after Dani discovers Christian having sex with the cult member, and the women of the cult hold Dani, and scream along with her, I watched it and said to myself, ""this is actually what trauma survivors need.  Not for people to check in on them, not for people to try and distract them.  Trauma survivors need people to be so present for them with their pain, to experience the pain along with them, to encourage them to scream through it, to encourage them to express it.""

As far as I'm concerned, this movie is second only to Akerman's Jeanne Dielman in its successful depiction of trauma recovery.",c7y18a

\-Dani has episodes where she can't breathe/catch her breath which causes panic attacks (or vice/versa?)

&#x200B;

\-When Christian and Dani are together, they take the oxygen away from each other as evidenced by Christian trying to light the birthday candle on the cake but it won't stay lit

esn50ag,"Man I fucking loved that. Looking back on the whole thing, you can see how so much of what the cult does feeds into it being a truly empathetic family. Their pained reactions to the guy that doesn’t die after jumping off the cliff, their crying in sync with Dani, even down to their fucking moans of pleasure and stroking themselves as one of them has sex. The whole thing inevitably leading to Dani finally finding self-respect among people who respect her and *truly* empathize with her feelings, as opposed to Christian who only pretends to care.

Certainly not as scary as Hereditary, as that felt like a true onslaught of horrific imagery, outside of Josh and Matt’s deaths. But overall, a much tighter narrative with so much compelling and well-placed symbolism for what a support network and what relationship *should* look like.

8/10

EDIT: Also, thinking about it more, I think that Dani (and previous may queens) won the dance competition because it requires an element of being in tune with the people around you and their movements. Dani, a very sensitive and caring person, was naturally more aware of the people around her, and in a sense, her being crowned the winner is also crowning her as the most empathetic person, which is the actual goal of the whole dance competition.",c7y18a

esnouzr,"This one is going to be way more divisive than Hereditary was. I just love the fact that people that usually only watch Blum House horror movies are going to sit through this haha

That being said I was slightly disappointed in this. I don't know what I was expecting but I thought the movie would ratchet up the tension at some point. There is that scene of the black guy kinda piecing together what is going on and I thought he would figure it out, tell his friends, and from there on out it was going to be a violent and wild escape attempt from this cult, but nope, the rest of the movie is the main characters tripping on drugs until the end. We definitely get some weird shit with the sex scene, chicken coop, and temple burning, but shit doesn't hit the fan like it would with another movie. That might be something I appreciate later about this movie but I guess I was just waiting for something that wasn't going to happen. 

I'm kinda bad at picking out themes and stuff but one thing I noticed is that the only people that die are people that are not respecting their culture (the British people freaking out and yelling after the cliff jump) or people stepping over boundaries they shouldn't (the guy peeing on the graves and the guy sneaking pictures of the book). Dani is the only one that lives and she's the only one that doesn't make a scene about anything they're doing and she doesn't go where she isn't supposed to. She kinda embraces their customs with the dance and helping the ladies cook. She's respectful the whole time too.  I know her BF gets burnt but that's because it's Dani's choice and not the cults. I don't know if there is a deeper meaning or anything to all of this but I thought it was interesting.",c7y18a

None of the others asked her how she was holding up, but the fact Christian didn't bother was so typical of his character...and that in turn made me hate him more.",c7y18a
il1cnhg,"There are so many subtleties in this film, I love all the layers. The wizard of oz story, the faces in the trees, the forest and flowers breathing, the story of Dani and her family being known by the cult before she arrived, the picture over Dani’s bed; the list goes on. I find this movie horrific precisely because there are no supernatural elements, the horror is that everyone is 100% human and quite nice at times, so earnest in their beliefs that just happen to include rape and torture and murder. 

To me this film is about messed up codependent relationships. Christian is a bad boyfriend. He is not wanting to help his partner traumatised partner, everything about Dani bores or exhausts him he resents her, his gf, wanting his support. He hasn’t broken up with her because he doesn’t want to deal with more of her emotions plus nothing/no one better has come along. Even him staying with her is an example of him being a selfish and lazy coward. 

Sure Pelle seems genuine, he believes the cult will help Dani but it won’t and it can’t. It’s a cult, they are just using her for their own ends as Christian was. 

Dani had a choice to free Christian, she doesn’t. I don’t entirely blame her but it is horrifying and she’s damned herself. She’s either stuck drinking the kool aid with this cult for the rest of her life (it was bad enough watching Christian dismiss, minimise, and subvert her feelings what will the cult do to her if she expresses needs they don’t agree with?) or she’s gonna wake up one day and realise they drugged her and encouraged her to murder her bf. That’s not gonna help her trauma 

The scene where the women hysterically cry with Dani is distressing. I’ve seen a lot of people talking about mirroring and how the Harga really share in Dani’s pain which helps Dani feel less alone. And I can see that but I had a very different reaction to that scene. 
They are not sharing in her pain. They helped create her pain by drugging her bf and raping him then letting her discover it without explaining they set the whole thing up. It’s not empathy to cry with someone when you’re the one who made them cry. Also I found their hysterical weeping, as if they were more upset than Dani detracted from her anguish, they weren’t sharing her grief they were hijacking it for their own, to have a cathartic release themselves. Dani has never been more alone and misunderstood than in that scene.

She has a lonely messed up codependent relationship with Christian. She’s very unhappy and vulnerable. The cult uses all of that against her and manipulate her to bring her into”the family” because they have a use for her, not because they care about her in any way. She’s worse off than when she started. She has not recovered from trauma she’s just had double, triple the trauma dumped on her. That very last shot she smiles-is it happiness? Freedom, relief, hope?Or madness? Family can be the best or it can be the worst. 

I’ve watched it twice now and I have conflicting feelings the whole way through particularly about the Harga. The whole thing is like a fairy tale, Dani is our princess and she gets her happy ending with the caveat be careful what you wish for!",c7y18a

Very good, but not great. Doesn’t let loose quite as much as i would’ve liked it to. Has similar strengths to Hereditary and similar flaws. It’s a tick too long.

et1gbhf,"There’s some hints that Pelle operated as both a friend, an operative following the community’s agenda and need for new blood, AND on his own motive in regard to Dani. Did anyone else get some vibes that suggested Pelle had interest in Dani in ways that mirrored his sister to Christian? Where his sister pursued Christian for physical needs, Pelle seemed to like or wanted to foster an empathic/emotional bond with Dani that might have been more later...but we never see what happens “next,” just left with the suggestion that the potential is there. There’s some great lines between him and her that aren’t in the movie but were in the script. 

Pelle seems both genuine in his concern for Dani, but entirely aware of how he and his community “gain” when he can coax her trust. Another actor could have totally played Pelle as a straightforward manipulative or intentionally grey character, but I think the direction for Pelle on screen made him less creepy and still likable despite being totally complicit in the actions of his community and the outcome of all the characters. 

Copying from a reply I made: 

I didn’t think much of it when I saw it, just thought it a quirky line, but Dani mentions she’s a cancer and Pelle perks up and says he’s a Taurus. I have no knowledge of astrology, so I looked it up today and read a run of the mill compatibility summary: cancer and Taurus would be considered ideal or strongly suited matches. Cancers are emotional and strongly ruled by their feelings and environment, Taurus are more grounded and firm in whatever their beliefs. If you’re someone who puts no faith in astrology and think it’s cold reading, you might go: sure that sounds like them but it’s a nice coincidence. If you’re Pelle or someone who deeply believes in the connection of nature, etc. you might jump at that as a sign from *something* that this is “the right path” to keep going and that Dani is the right one (for him, for the community) or whatever. Pelle ends up having that crown at the end for his own intuition.

As the guy being engulfed, you have full trust in your cult and you feel your making a genuine sacrifice. But then suddenly to feel significant pain, you feel betrayed and confused in your final moments before you die. Furthermore, the other guy was told he would “feel no fear” with the drug.

Not saying that Christian deserved his fate by any means, but I felt like it was pretty telling of this ""fantasy"" that Dani was living out of punishing Christian and leaving behind that part of her life that was filled with pain and panic.

esoswfg,"Man this really was ""the Wizard of Oz for perverts."" 

Dani (Dorothy) - The one in the group who just wants nothing more than to go ""home"" metaphorically speaking. She just wants peace. 

Christian (Cowardly Lion) - He has a lack of courage to break up with Dani and to move on, and by dragging his feet just makes the relationship worse. On top of that, he kind of collapses under pressure. Could also use the imagery of him wrapped in bear skin and burning alive as a visual call back, albeit a more extreme one, to the Lion catching his tail on fire in Oz.

Josh (Tin Man) - He's the only one who sees the acts of violence and does nothing more than emotionlessly take notes for his thesus. He's unemotional and accepts what's happening around him as a unique culture different to his. Obviously this leads to him being ""heartless"" and taking pictures of the sacred text even when told not to. 

Mark (Scarecrow) - Mark is a completely idiot to everything around him. Whether it is cracking jokes at the culture difference, calling Christian out for being a ""bitch,"" all the way to him pissing on the sacred tree. It's obviously he doesn't care about any of it unless it pertains to him, and it's the lack of intelligence of not knowing to shut up that gets him killed. Plus this analogy helps at the end as he's the one with sticks and branches for arms and legs.

Depriving the audience of seeing the characters get a full meal just adds on to the experience that everything is happening in this quiet, helpless isolation -- the characters are being starved out and stripped of their defenses. A really splendid display of doing stuff in sync, some very dry looking meat pasties (pube ala mode) and some tea...but otherwise everyone seemed to eat pretty lean. We never get very clear shots of what they're eating, just glimpses or suggestions of what might encompass the meal. That's kind of interesting. At one point, it was knives, forks, a little coaster and the meat pie resting on top. We get the one bite from Christian, but no one else seems to be putting food in their mouths, but the meal is always ""done"" at the end and the plates cleared away. (Behind the scenes filming logic deliberately side stepped here; spit buckets, etc. Leaving that out) There were decorative tins with what looked like carrots.

Will Poulter is hilarious as the asshole friend.   But the fact that most of his laugh lines are off screen ADR kept bugging me.  None of the 4 Americans seriously considering leaving after the suicide ritual was not at all believable.  Christian suddenly washing his hands of Josh and Mark after they disappeared was confusing.   The fact that nothing ever came of the very obvious moment where Dani saw one of the girls place a pair of scissors under the pillow in the crib was always on the back of my mind.   Dani eventually winning the May Queen competition was too obvious and contrived for it apparently to have not been planned.

I didn’t hate the movie by any means, and can see there is something there that a lot of people will like.  But for me it just didn’t work.  I’d give it a 5.5-6/10, which is a little lower than I’d score Hereditary.",c7y18a

Deaths felt really poorly executed. e.g. will poulter/mark, i was lookiong forward to seeing based off of black mirror, but his character was never developed. his accent was also wack. e.g. girl just asks him to come, and you realise thats it hes dead, nothing more.

some of the scenes were almost boringly extended/long

She was weeping and screaming because she just found her mother hanging in the kitchen. That scene brought that memory straight back to me.

Well, the ride really wasn't so wild, unfortunately. I have no problem with a slow paced, character driven horror film, which Hereditary was, but I felt Ari Aster didn't really sustain the atmosphere throughout. After a while, it felt really dull, especially since all of the characters were flat and incredibly stupid. The performances were at least pretty good, though, especially Pugh. She's astoundingly natural and can wail and cry like no other.  


While the film didn't completely work for me, I can't fault Aster technically. He can capture realistic grief like no other. The film is well shot and precisely edited, but it felt way too long for uninteresting characters and predictable payoff. There aren't really any surprises in this film, as it's all cult stuff we've seen before and you can see the ending coming a mile away.

It seems like for the math to work, they really need to limit it to 5 outsiders, or they'll end up with extras.  And even then, if the Queen doesn't choose the outsider (which if the Queen is a cultist, why wouldn't she?) they'd have that extra.  What would happen to them?",c7y18a

The color palette and psychedelic-look was mesmerizing to look at and almost made you feel like you were tripping. Acting was top notch, good music, great setting. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.

The bad: While it is certainly messed up in many ways, I felt Ari went a little soft on the audience, as a lot of the fu**** up parts occur off screen. I appreciated the lack of jump scares, but I wish it was more frightening and shocking. It also drags at times, and the chanting/screaming was a little over the top at times. I also wished the grief scene at the start played more of a role in the plot, it just kind of happened and then was almost forgotten about. And the sex scene was just a little too long for my tastes, but oh well.

eso94eh,"One aspect of this movie I don't see being brought up very much is the theme of breathing being SO predominant. All of Dani's trauma and breakdowns center around breathing. Her family died essentially by suffocating, her panic attacks devolve into fits of hyperventilation, she tries to calm herself by steadying her breathing and failing every time, her nightmare ended with her choking on car exhaust.


Even the environments breathe. Acid trips have been described to be as seeing the walls and ceiling breathe or pulse, like everything around you has a life of it's own. When Dani is feeling the full effects of the drugs after the dance we see the flowers on her crown have a steady breath, the trees are breathing back and forth as well.


And then we see in the commune how so much of his festival involves these very specific breaths as part of ritual, extremely deliberate and odd. After drinks, before/after ceremonies, before they started dancing, so many moments compounded with that quick awkward loud breath. Definitely the ""tongue click"" of this movie for sure. The group of women consoling Dani after seeing her boyfriend having sex with someone else is ultimately ends with them putting her screams and breathing back into a rhythm. We see Dani choking on the smoke from fire at the end but after barely moving and inch it stops impacting her as she realizes what's happening and embraces it.",c7y18a
esto98y,"A few observations:

The scene where they walk backwards and pick flowers seems to represent the reversal of death, part of the death/rebirth cycle.

There’s also a scene where they dance in a way that seems to mimic a seed growing into a plant, also part of the death/rebirth cycle.

Technology is very prominent in the beginning of the film and usually associated with dread. This contrasts with the rest of the film where not even their cell phones work. It also gives Dani another reason to leave her old life behind.

All the main cast wear dark clothes which helps to make them stand out from the rest of the community.

Dani isolates herself every time she becomes too upset at the start of the film, contrasting with the later scene where everyone sympathetically cries with her.

Dani’s breath is a recurring theme. The way she blows out the candle on her birthday is reminiscent of the breath thing they do throughout the film. And in earlier scenes when she’s upset she seems to hold her breath, refusing to exhale. This may tie into her grief and inability to stop dwelling on ""what could have been,"" as one of the members of the commune puts it.

In her nightmare she exhales a black cloud, seemingly a physical representation of her grief and depression. This parallels the method of death of her sister and parents, the inhalation of toxicity and the inability to exhale, emotionally or literally.

Her sister’s final message ""everything’s black"" contrasts with her experience at the commune where everything is colorful and it’s literally always sunny.",c7y18a

i think the biggest thing for me was that i repeatedly felt uncomfortable throughout the movie - not sure if it was just the way i was feeling or the content of the film but i was squirming and readjusting my posture for the entire 2.5 hours. i agree in that the majority of the characters were DUMB - but i also can see how their minds were ""clouded"" by the cocktail of hallucinogenics and homeopathic beverages.

all in all i left with mixed feelings but the movie's ability to make me deeply uncomfortable and uneasy is a sign that it did what it was meant to do.

ALSO - at the beginning of the movie Dani's sister's email said ""its all black here - mom and dad are coming with me"" or something along those lines. i really liked how when the group arrived at the festival in Sweden it was made clear that there was absolutely no darkness (midnight sun, 24 hours of daylight) which may have symbolized how Dani had ""escaped"" the darkness and potentially the ""clouding"" of her late family.",c7y18a

That being said, it really did strike me as a realization that a whimsical world you’d only see in one of Wes Anderson’s film would come of incredibly offputting and upsetting in the real world.

I haven’t felt a lingering sense of dread like this in a while.

It’s easy to says that Aster holds on unsettling moments for just enough time to make you squirm, but this and Hereditary both were able to convey such heavy levels of grief and fear that it felt like someone stepping on my chest at points.

I’ve never been bothered by knife-wielding killers and the like, but cults never cease to put me on edge, and I thought the cast of commune perfectly walked the line between bright-eyes yet hollow inside followers of some crazy tradition.

As to the main cast, I think it’s a testament to them that I rooted for and hated just about every one of them at one point...except maybe Mark.  He seemed like a genuinely oblivious dimwit who just wanted to get lit up in Sweden with his friends.",c7y18a

The film really captured some interesting aspects of life, crazy shit can happen that will bring you to your knees. Community and family is the best support system you can ask for. Dying with dignity isn't pretty but neither is a nursing home. We don't really question or challenge the system when things seem wrong and friends go missing (because of the implication). Our crazy shit seems normal to us because that's how we were raised.

The acting performances were strong and the foreshadowing kept it interesting. That said there were two standout moments that reminded me of other media. The orgy scene felt similarly shot as Aniara (2018) and the ending reminded me of the Them episode where they went in the past and was all black and white.

I think it's been discussed but the once 90 years thing felt a little strange. Obviously they are doing this much more frequently so is that simply to entice the outsiders or is there a deeper meaning?

It was literally the same old “dumb kids enter house/commune/hotel and are too stupid to realize the people there are going to kill them”.The weird cult commune was exactly what we thought it would be (it’s a horror movie, of course they kill people).

f5zy7nz,"Saw it yesterday, I'd say I definitely prefer Hereditary over this. Hereditary was much more cohesive and well told in my opinion. Midsommar could've really benefitted from some tighter editing, especially for the third act. The movie was progressing really well but the final 20-30 mins killed the pacing and didn't really lead to much. Although I'd say the few scares that were peppered in between were some of the most potent I've seen in recent memory. Ari Aster really knows how to use unsettling gruesome imagery to its best effect. 

  
Also, to the people thinking everything was very predictable due to heavy foreshadowing, this is not a movie where the plot is mean to be unpredictable and we are meant to guess what is going to happen. This is a movie that builds dread by telling you what is going to happen but waiting to see how it will play out. And, I think it is a very good example of the dread filled slow burn horror as opposed to the unpredictable jump scare suspense horror of the Conjuring universe.",c7y18a
f8rhqv3,"For rating purposes, I give it a 3.5/5. I feel like the heavy foreshadowing ruined it for me. I felt like I knew too much of what was gonna happen, especially since some scenes dragged on a lot. Like the ""attestupa"" scene. Right before, Dani asked Pelle what happens to the people once they turn 72 and he ""jokingly"" says that they die. Two minutes later, you show me too old people walking to the top of a cliff for a ritual that we aren't told the details of, but it's inferred that it's shocking?? How am I not supposed to assume they jump off that cliff? And the early imagery before they even get to Midsommar kinda told the movie too. There's this scene where there's a picture on someone's door and it has a girl looking forward to a big city -- Dani is talking and she moves in front of the picture and takes the place of the girl in it and looks towards the new city. I feel like it was too on the nose and in my face??  Also, I wish Reuben got more screen time.

(Also, what's up with that scene where Dani is in the bathroom and she sees something standing behind her in the reflection? Does that connect with something or just apart of the psychedelic trip she was on?)

I loved the visuals of the film. I loved the emotion that Dani showed. I loved the comedic relief of Will Poulter's character. I loved the portrayal of the rocky relationship between Dani and Christian. But I'm confused on whether I loved this movie and it's overall story.",c7y18a

I was really loving the movie for most of the first half, but it lost me somewhere after. Once the credits rolled I felt pretty disappointed to be honest. However, I cannot stop thinking about this movie. Usually when I see a movie I put it off after a couple hours, but I've been running this movie through my head all day. Honestly, I've started to appreciate it the more I think about it. This seems like a movie that needs to be viewed more than once so I'll probably be catching it again in theaters.

Also, everyone is talking about how the movie is about grief and relationships. To me the biggest takeaway theme was religion. The scripture these people follow is written by the product of incest. I also loved at the end when the two volunteer sacrifices were given some type of medicine that would nullify any pain and fear. However, right when the fire engulfed one of the volunteers he screamed in pain which makes me think he's now realizing his faith is all bullshit.

Won't Dani just live peacefully with the cult without them doing anything freaky? It seems like the freaky is over for another 90 years when she'll be long dead. She'll just cook and clean with her new family and... that's it?

Ari Aster is also really, really good at writing women characters. He doesn't ignore their femininity and turn them into stoic badasses, he makes them fully realized characters with flaws and shortcomings like everyone else, which is quite refreshing. Annie's struggles with motherhood and Dany's struggles with her relationship are told in a way that embraces both character's femininity, while still making it accessible to the audience as a whole. 

I loved the cinematography especially. The art and interiors were beautiful and creepy. I wouldn't say the movie is scary, but it certainly was horrifying. It was also strangely funny. That sex scene was so conflicting because it was equally as funny as it was fucked up. When the lady grabbed his ass to give him a little push I fucking lost it.",c7y18a

Like to oversimplify it, the women were basically her friends saying ""girl, leave him"", and the ritual being that final push. Ari Aster said he wrote this after a breakup, and that ""this is exactly what happened"". If Hereditary was him dealing with loss in his family, this is the breakup that followed - his partner not being able to be there for him through the grieving, wanting to leave but feeling guilt in the process. I don't mean to invade his personal life, I'm just trying to make sense of what everything might've meant. All the other possible metaphors, I'll have to think more about.

1. Mental health...particularly the portrayals of anxiety and grief. I felt like I was being choked when Dani would scream/cry with her mouth shut in an effort to hold it in when she was very much unable to. I know exactly what that feels like...it’s something you hide when you’re going through it, but to have seen it on the big screen...it felt like a secret of mine was being told. It really...really stuck with me.

2. I was so grateful for the comedic relief. I’m glad our theater caught it as well. Much needed.

3. The group emotions, I was torn about that. It was obviously a hive mind mentality and meant to display that full sense of “community” but it made me so uncomfortable.

4. The MUSIC! This movie did not let you pick your own emotions and the music really drove that home! Especially in the end when the fire starts and it looks like joy and then BAM that minor key shift and then everyone’s display of emotions turned much more sinister in appearance.

5. Just like Hereditary...I won’t see it again. I won’t recommend it to anyone. But damn that movie was incredible.",c7y18a

The suicides represented how trauma can really smack you in the face (the extra hammers really 'hammering' that point home) and the feelings of isolation shown by Christian's eventual giving in to the other girl. During this, the cult's empathetic moans and groans seemed to represent the importance of a support system during healing. 

The cult seemed to just be a super simplified version of society that let's the viewer better see one person's journey through grief.

It all coalesces when Dani smiles at the realization of healing. Her crappy boyfriend represented an anchor to the grief that burned away.

This interpretation also requires me just ignoring the 50 other scenes that I just don't understand at all",c7y18a

Dani’s smile was not a sign of healthy empowerment. Was the smile at the end of heredity a sign of a good thing?? No. The cult was run by a bunch of manipulative old men who stay in power by making up scripture.  It is not a story of real female empowerment, but how cult’s manipulate people at their lowest.

But lol bf a dick and she was happy about it. Such a cathartic smile right?? Pretty absurd that is the take away. Pele manipulated what he knew was an unhealthy relationship when Dani was at her lowest. This is intended to be a terrifying ending, not happy at all.

Everyone watching seemed to be really into it to, so I'm hoping/guessing word of mouth is positive or at least making others very interested in seeing it. During the sex scene one guy behind me said it was the worst porno he'd ever watched, and there were a lot of 'oh fucks' at the cliff jumping. Anyway, other than the pacing, I noticed that throughout the film Harga first appears filled with outsiders and livestock. By the end it becomes very desolate almost, nearly all the outsiders have vanished in some way, and all the livestock is gone except for the chickens. I loved how Aster made the cult feel so welcoming at first, and by the end you feel utterly trapped. I'm actually looking forward to the extended cut as there were a few more rituals and dialogue scenes that were in the script that were cut in the film that I'd like to see.

You can see people gathered outside the shed along with the young girl who ""seduced"" Mark crying to another girl. The young girl had blood on her nose and forehead.

Does she look like that to imply she took part in the killing of not just  Mark , but also Connie? You hear her screams off camera I guess right as she’s being dragged to her death.

f3ja2sb,"Okay Mr.Aster. You have my attention.

**Things I liked:**

1. Holy cow this guy knows his creepy effigies.

2. Loved how the entire movie was serene rather than explicitly creepy.

3. Really appreciated the boyfriend repeatedly avoiding difficult conversations until he was forced to by circumstance (e.g. deciding to go to Sweden without tellng Dani, inviting Dani to Sweden without tellling his friends, choosing to copy his friend's thesis). It's an interesting character flaw because it isn't maleficient, but can have really disastrous consequences. Additionally, I really loved that the director chose not to have anyone explicitly call him out on it. Usually a movie would repeatedly show a flaw like this because there's going to be an entire scene dedicated to having one of the characters bang the audience over the head with it, reciting all the examples. Instead, it was just another example of him being a shitty person which some observers would pick up on earlier than others.

**Pros**

1. Beautiful film. The design, fashion and colors were beautifully picked. I loved the serene vibe throughout the movie. Reminded me of my backpacking days. Pugh is gorgeous in the May Queen outfit.

2. Aster loves trauma and writes it well.

**Cons**

1. Relating to 2 above: had a hard time sympathizing with the characters because of how horrible they treat Dani.

2. I thought the suicide segment and how willing the camera work was to zoom in on their disfigurement was leading to a brutal/violent climax -- it was not.

3.  General horror complaint - how can you simply ignore that fact that everyone is disappearing? I thought the movie was going to be an 'escape the crazy cult' finale -- it was not.

If I wasn't solidly 7 beers down I think the run-time would have killed the movie for me. Hereditary was simply fantastic and set this movie up to be simply 'ok' -- it's hard not to judge it against Hereditary. Would recommend others to watch it - knowing the film is a 'slow burn' and anti-climactic before heading in may help.",c7y18a
esn51b5,"This might be too on the nose but I felt like a lot of it had to do with how absurd religion is, in general. There were multiple mentions and nods to how we, as outsiders, can't comprehend what we're seeing/experiencing because we haven't experienced other beliefs and cultures. The only people who go along with it, besides the village members, are the students who are strictly there for academic purposes. It's like they're studying animals in a zoo. Their response is essentially, ""don't question it.""

Furthermore, Dani essentially assimilates into this culture despite the absurdity and inhumanity. She seemingly only does this when her grief has completely overwhelmed her which is directly mirrored to how people become adherents to religion in real life. They reach and grasp for some meaning and reason for everything that it envelops their sense of reason.

Lastly, Ari makes it a point to focus on the fact that the mentally-handicapped inbred writes their doctrine.

[All the art and symbols.](http://www.mupan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/midsommar_color_web.jpg)  The psychedelics.  The way the bodies were designed/displayed in the temple.  The world building is incredible.

The prologue instantly fills you full of dread.  You really fucking feel for this girl and the grief she feels later on whenever someone mentions family.  Every actor is fantastic, though the guy playing the shitty boyfriend might've done it TOO well.  He was stiff and boring (that was probably the point) up until the post May Queen scenes.  I really loved Josh's character and wish we got more of him.  

The soundtrack is disturbing, uncomfortable, and amazing.. Which is probably the most important part of any horror movie.

His eyes seemed to change in very subtle ways.",c7y18a
etn3cxy,"Reposting with a few new thoughts I had.

My take is that the film is about isolation and the costs of not belonging to a community. Almost all the people who visit the commune are absorbed in themselves or don't care for others, and they all die because of it.

Dani's boyfriend is an obvious example. From the beginning of the movie he talks about breaking up with Dani, and forgets her birthday. He's not even that loyal to his close friends; he steals his friend's thesis. Most of the friends are primarily concerned with themselves and their own interests. Everyone who gets killed wanders off by themselves, isolating themselves from the rest of the group.

The cult are polar opposites, they're devoted to their community and willing to sacrifice themselves for each other. They are in tune with the legacy of their ancestors. They think about other people, not just themselves. Pelle was the one to remember Dani's birthday. He asks her ""do you feel held by him?"" Think about how they all scream when ever someone is in pain or anguish to sympathize with them.

Dani survives because she yearns for human connection and community. She begs for Christian not to leave her in the beginning. She participates in the cult activities and joins their group.

The twist is that while the cult is on it's face grotesque and terrifying, its members are part of an integrated, open community, as opposed to the friends who are isolated from one another because they come from a culture of self-promotion and individualism.

Also, think about the closing song from the credits. One of the lyrics is: ""the sun ain't gonna shine anymore.... when you're without love""",c7y18a

f3o11ld,"So I just saw this, finally.  Overall, I thought it was amazing. Did anyone else think that Dani, by winning would have to mate with the Oracle?  Maybe I was expecting something darker after Hereditary?

Also, did I misinterpret the scene, or was Pelle able to avoid sacrifice because he brought Dani and she won the May Queen competition?  Otherwise he would have had to die in place of the lottery ""winner""?  Was that the reason he was so fond of her?",c7y18a

Florence Pugh is stupidly attractive but she can act and is used fairly well. The rest of the cast is fairly straight cut and you won't be surprised by a thing they do. 

Logic started going out of the window by the 2nd half of it and I felt it just went into standard horror mode and nothing especially unpredictable after or capitalised on the brooding momentum from the 1st half.

I enjoyed aspects of  the film thoroughly. The scenery, the acting , the flower costume at the end. However , there were multiple plot holes that disturbed me.

I felt that the Stockholm syndrome part of it was too sudden. Dani needed to be brought around in subtle steps, rather than going from intense horror to enjoyment.

Although Christian was a jerk , I still had sympathy for him The others may have violated the rules, but he did not. It would have been better if he was not drugged beforehand, but was chosen to die  still kicking and screaming.

I went home feeling very distracted and unable to express anything and just generally exhausted, which is kind of cool! Today I feel a bit recharged and am excited to see it again!

There’s lots of beauty in this movie and I agree with others that say they could’ve sat through two more hours of this.

The scene where Dani turns towards where Christian is impregnating the girl and keeps walking and looks through the keyhole really struck me. I felt such a pit in my stomach and I feel like I internalized a lot of the family- and relationship-centered grief from this movie so I walked away from it feeling very sad honestly! I’m excited to watch again and put more of a focus on other aspects of the movie. 

The scene that transitions from Josh sitting outside at daytime to him sitting on his bed at night was something I saw in the trailer that I was very excited to see on the big screen.

The ~~community~~ cult members who died/were sacrificed throughout the film all looked terrified just before their deaths.

* Woman who jumped from the cliff looked really scared just before she jumped.
* Man who jumped from the cliff was visibly terrified once his jump hadn't killed him.
* The two fellows in the pyramid at the end broke composure just as the flames engulfed them and looked/sounded horrified.

I think that's all the Swedes who died.

But my point is that throughout the film, they're all supposed to be treating this as ""the way of things"" for them. Then at the last moments when they have to make that sacrifice, each one of them (to my mind) has a sudden awakening or realisation that means they can't keep their composure any longer.

aside from being one of the weirdest movies ive ever seen, i had a pretty strange theater experience too. at some point a guy yelled “shut the fuck up” at people who were talking in the theater. really added to the overall experience. and as funny as this movie was, some people couldnt take a hint that perhaps not *all* of it was supposed to be funny. i understand laughing at the bizarreness of the sex scene and singing rituals, but some people laughed when dani locked herself in the plane's restroom to sob and then laughed again at the cliff jumping scene. i just don’t understand. 

i wonder if the first act being almost completely dark was a juxtaposition to the rest of the movie being in broad daylight and what that juxtaposition meant

edit: im noticing reviews on youtube that claimed the first 20 minutes of this movie had no relevance to the rest of it and after watching it that was just untrue. the reason dani chose to go to the festival was to take her mind off the tragedy since she had no use grieving alone because no one around really cared. they make it seem like the moment she got to the festival her grieving process stopped when it was because she was led to believe no one would be there for her leading up the the climax which was the women of the cult showing empathy and crying with her. i couldnt find a reason to how the first act wouldnt be relevant.",c7y18a

\- What was up with the scissors in the crib? There was the references to the baby crying, but I have a hard time making the connection that the baby was somehow pricking itself and that's what was causing it to fuss.  


\- What was Pelle drawing back in the US? He tells Dani it was a table, but he seems to hide it and it didn't seem like a sketch of any old table.

\- When Josh asks Christian whether he knows about the pink drink. Christian lies and tries to pass off that he knows the reference, but obviously doesn't. What is the reference that Josh makes? Is the pink drink an aphrodisiac?  
\-  Whatever happened to the other groups of ""outsider"" who are hanging out on the first night?  
\- I get that the elders can use Reuben's finger painting as a way to have an reason for ambiguity for shaping the cult society, but was the reference to incest just an excuse, and that likely the ""elders"" will have always used some weak or ""pure"" as The Oracle?

\- What was up with the symbology on the difference characters linen?

\- In Hereditary there was art on walls that were left as Easter eggs, and it seems like there could have been explanations for the art that was in Christian's place. I also remember seeing a picture of a little blonde haired girl kissing a bear, which I specifically was curious about when a bear shows up out of nowhere in the cage. Finally, did anybody see all the morbid tapestries in the community room? There was art of a spear through a woman, somebody naked on fire, people on stake. All types of crazy shit.

eut1yr2,"Agree with some of the other posters here about the characters' reactions to their friends being slowly killed off. For me though the biggest problem was the ending, even the final shot. I didn't find Dani's jump from ""I hate this place it's fucking dodgy and I want to go home"" to ""I love it here and I'm gonna burn my boyfriend to death"" to be convincing at all. Sure, she sees him having sex with the red headed girl, but the scenario (nay, the whole thing) was so fucked up that surely she must be questioning whether he was under the influence of something or not.

&#x200B;

There's an interesting comment made toward the start of the film (I think Pele says it to Dani) about the rituals being a kind of ""theatre"". Essentially meaning it's not real and all just costumes and make believe. Jump to the final moment of the film - where the big yellow building is on fire and Dani is looking around at all the people in the cult screaming etc. - and it should have dawned on her there and then what she had done. The last shot is of her smiling, but for me it should have been a face of regret, a face haunted by the realisation that she has chosen to murder her boyfriend (tensions aside) of 4 years in the name of this ""theatre"" that she has somehow bought into in the space of 9 days. Didn't buy it.",c7y18a
ew0n7gg,"... in principle this is not only valid and interesting in case Aster had been aware of the stark contrast he was establishing between his characters (especially Christian) and Sergeant Howie; it actually is even more of an insight into contemporary culture in case Aster had done it unconsciously. The thing is, Christian, Dani and Sergeant go through very similar challenges, especially with the attempt of seduction and even death by being burned alive. However, Aster's statement is not to highlight universalisty of some ""human nature""- he is clearly not saying that 50 years after The Wicker Man was created people may end up in similar situations and the inevitability of painful death no matter who, where and especially when you are (as in his Hereditary, which the director himself reffered to as ""a Greek tragedy""). Midsommar, if we are to use comparative analysis, is about how helpless the modern man is even in the face of the helplessness induced on him by his fate and by unchangable circumstances. 

&#x200B;

To take a very simple example, one of the circumstances both Howie and Christian undergo is an attempt of seduction by the village's native. Obviously, of course, they are different in their behaviour; Howie rejects decisevely, while Christian passively acccepts, and yet there is much more to it than mere behaviour. We see more than Howie rejecting the flirtations and the invitation to stay the night by the daughter of the inn's owner- we see how he struggles and suffers, overwhelmed by lust and moreover how he refuses to identify with his lust as his faith commands him not to. In other words, the last night Sergeant spends in the village is a climax of the character's internal drama, the last real decision he takes before being overtaken by the villagers' conspiracy. To use a clearly overused quotation, his refusal to sleep with the woman he clearly desires is his own way to ""not go gentle into that good night"". You will see nothing of that in Christian. For him there is not even real temptation to give up to or to overcome. He is simply carried along by a wind, terrified of what is happening without trying to escape or tell his friends. From the very first appearence he is introduced as an indicisive, insultingly weak person, similtaniously unable to stand by his girlfriend in times of probably the most horrible event of her life or to break up with her. He is not even scared because to be scared is to suffer- and he does not. To desire is to suffer- and does Christian really desire Maja? does he not? well, we have no way of finding out. But most likely not. Still having sex with her.

&#x200B;

I do not want to get Nietzshian by highlighting how Sergeant Howie is a christian martyr- übermensch and Chirstian is weak- willed or moreover to say how people used to be better when they believed in eating Christ's flesh and telling priests how often they masturbate- this is not about a person or about a religion but, in my opinion, about the Zeitgeist changing dramatically from 1975 to 2019. Christian does not have a ""bad"" or a ""weak"" identity- he simply does not have one- ""whatever goes"". It's not that he has no morals or ethical guidelines - he just kind of really does not know what they are. And this is exactly what makes Christian so inferior to Howie- when you are sentenced to first witnessing your friends die and thereafter to an extremely painful death what have you except for the ability to meet it with pride, shameless and convinced you've done what's right even when you know that ""right"" is not universal (and Howie would be very insensitive not to start questioning his cultural standars and the universality of his morals after what he had gone through). Is this not a statement about, say, climate change or nuclear arms? Not a statement on how successfully the modern man has been trained to simply go gentle and selfless into what is around him no matter how threatening or ""wrong"" it is?

Ari Aster has created a new genre: Smashed-in-face Horror.

* Then we get the crushing scene of the suicide. Something I love about Ari Aster is that he manages impactful moments and visuals that stand on their own. There are no sound effects or jumpcut to carry the weight. 

* I was so excited when I figured out why the color of Christians drink was darker, and what that hair in his pie was. It felt more impressive at the time than it really was. Half of my reaction was to just how fucked up it was, and how good the filmmaking was there. 

* The visuals were breathtaking. I wonder how they achieved that ethereal look. It couldn't just have been color grading, right? 

Midsommar was just overall a very special experience. More out there than Hereditary, and never as tense or scary. But it's still a quality movie that left me with goosebumps at the end.",c7y18a

Girlfriend was so understanding (and great acting), but swung all the way around at the end. So story-wise, I felt like it could have been a lot stronger, but it seems the main point was how Dani felt like she had no-one to lean on and Pelle, drugs and becoming Queen (which might have been a setup?) convinced her that the cult was the safety net she needed. So Dani's arch might be an extreme example of how someone can grow to feel like they belong in a creepy cult.",c7y18a

Mark was skinned and stuffed with straw

Christian was stuffed into a bear skin

Simon was flayed alive into that blood eagle thing

Connie was drowned (Water?)

Josh was buried (Earth?)

2 elders fell from a high cliff (Air?), the man was stuffed with dead branches and the woman was stuffed with what looked like fruits

2 members gave their lives (Fire?)

&#x200B;

Also while the women were distracting Dani while Chris was having sex they planted meat, eggs, and grain into a hole and that had me thinking of three of the sacrifices:

Mark (where's the body), 

Simon (flayed in the chicken coop), 

and Josh (buried in the garden).

esp3qex,"A few questions...

\- The once every 90 years thing confused me... What were they talking about there? The wall of May Queens was FULL of photos, and photography hasn't been around long enough for those to be spaced out that far. Since the May Queen gets to pick the ninth sacrifice I would assume this happens way more often than every 90 years. But if this is happening every midsommar, how are they ""mating"" fast enough to recoup their numbers? 

\- What on earth is the symbolism behind Simons displayed body? They went to a lot of trouble to strap him up there/ keep him alive/ etc. Why?

\- For that matter, what was the deal with Joshes severed foot? I couldn't make out the rune on it 

\- Are the outsiders always welcome to ""assimilate"" or are they always assumed to become sacrifices and Dani was special? I was curious what they would have done with Christian if she hadn't chose him...",c7y18a

I felt the whole empathy/connection/loneliness themes really hard and going back from that out into the lobby and to my car was such a bizarre feeling of reintegration into society. 

I loved this movie but it definitely leans into the more absurd like we saw with some parts of Hereditary. Those were some of the most dicey parts of Hereditary for most general audiences and so I'm sure that this will be a *very* divisive film. There was a lot of nudity too, and I'm happy he didn't shy away from it. The movie overall felt so real, especially when it came to the community/cult members. The priestess explaining everything during that scene to the visitors who were freaking out just felt so real. Overall throughout the movie the dialogue and delivery was just so grounded and well done, the phone conversation at the beginning of the film for example had so much going on. Dani was such a great character and was played very very well. The sense of empathy and loneliness and needing connection was so intense and the crying scene in the nursery thing with the group will stay with me for a long time. It was such a beautiful movie visually. It feels weird to talk about how real it felt because it felt like such a crazy experience but nothing truly supernatural happens.",c7y18a
estlr1p,"I love how Ari Aster handles grief, especially the actors' portrayal of it. First we had Toni Collette, and then Florence Pugh, man, they both sold it. I haven't seen complete and utter heart-erenching grief so cuttingly displayed. 

This film, though, is all about the journey of grief. Seeing Dani go from isolation and complete separation from the world, to then being so in sync with the people around her, was beautiful. When all the women were screaming along with Dani, the emotion became palpable—this woman, who spent so long being inconsolable, only needed someone to mirror her and understand her.

I appreciate that Aster mostly stayed away from anything tangibly mystical in this one. Was expecting some occult phenomenon like Hereditary but pleasantly surprised. I think it added to the horror that these were just people in a very different (and sometimes disturbing) society from the main characters. Loved all the foreshadowing like gesturing that the elderly were killed, mentioning bringing in outsiders to mix bloodlines, and all the ritual pictures on the wall and in the beginning. The psychedelic aspect had me feeling like I was tripping along with them, like I noticed regularly that my heart rate was elevated for a lot of the film. People in the theater laughed at the communal sharing of emotions but I liked it and I think it was more of a metaphor for empathetic connection, like when Dani is wailing alone with Christian in the beginning but everyone joins in with her later in the film. This goes further with the psychedelics like Dani's body joining with the grass and the leaves mimicking her movements, and the rest of the film as everyone mimics a leader since their whole society is based on mimicking natural cycles, or ""the source"". And I really liked that the anthropologists allowed us to see some exposition without it being boring or in our faces.

I do have a few gripes though. I wish they went more into the whole oracle business. I still don't understand the scissors under the baby. And my biggest one is the whole Mark pissing fiasco. I imagine they have a designated area to relive themselves and showed the newcomers where that was upon their arrival. The tree was by no means secluded in a way that someone would think it would be a good spot to take a leak.

eta64ql,"This comment is ridiculously long, but I have so many thoughts on this movie!

TL;DR: may queens happen every year, the importance of the number nine, and a bunch of other stuff.

\- The midsummer festivals are held every year, and they typically include the may pole and a May queen, so they probably did have a kind of festival every year.  The number nine is significant in various cultures, with people sacrificing nine of various kinds of animals, Odin hanging on  Yggdrasil  for nine days and nights, nine realms/worlds, etc.  So the nine days with nine sacrifices and ninety years make sense. 

\- I think they held the festival every year, as is tradition, possibly sacrificing animals, and everyone over 72 killing themselves on that day, and may have done something ""extra"" every nine years, but I think they were telling the truth about this being every 90 years.  Maybe that's when they sacrifice humans, or that's when they bring in new blood.  I was surprised they killed off the other outsiders without having them do the weird sex ritual as well because that would have brought in new blood, which the community would need, but they did want Christian to have sex with Maja specifically because they were an ""astrological match.""  Honestly, with the inbreeding taboo, and only have one outsider have sex one time with a member of the community, I have no idea how they have so many kids running around.  Pelle did say that they have various jobs to make money for the community, so they may sleep with outsiders in surrounding areas and get pregnant, or get pregnant while on their ""journey.""  

\- I don't think Pelle's parents necessarily died as part of the ritual.  They could have just died in a fire.  This might have been in the movie because it helped him illustrate to Dani how the community helped to raise him and make him seem more empathetic.  I also think it's one of the few ways their deaths could be explained - they wouldn't have been murdered in that community, there seem to be very few cars, a workplace accident is unlikely to have taken them both, etc.  My other problem with them dying as part of the ritual is that it would mean they build that structure every year.  Do they just build over the ashes of the previous year?  

\- I have seen people write that Christian was raped.  I don't necessarily disagree, but I will say that he was checking out Maja more and more, and the drugs may have pushed him into a final decision.

\- After Dani sees Christian, and goes into the building crying, she starts having a panic attack.  The other women empathize with her, showing that they are there for her, and helping her to calm her breathing, and she settles without needing to take any medication.  Breath is very important in this movie.  At the beginning of the movie, the night she hears the news of her family, she wails.  But after that?  She tries to downgrade her grief, as if its bothersome.  We see her hide in bathrooms multiple times to hide herself away when she's crying or having a panic attack.  There are a couple of parts where I noticed that she sobs, holds her breath for a minute, and then inhales deeply, trying to push back those feelings so she doesn't show her grief.  She shouldn't have done the mushrooms in the first place, but she didn't want to spoil anyone's fun and seem like a downer.  The community shows her that it's ok to show your feelings, and that you don't have to feel them alone, or disassociate yourself from them.  They'll help you bear that burden, and she's had no one to lean on until that point.

\- At the end, when Dani is crying and wailing in her flower dress, are the other community members sharing HER pain, or the pain of those burning in the fire?  I thought perhaps it was her pain, and that's why she smiled.  I also wonder if Pelle was happy Dani was going simply because he liked her.  They have a moment when they hold hands and she worries about Christian seeing, he gave her a special drawing for her birthday but asked her to ""keep it between them,"" when she's at the table as the May Queen, he is drawing her; he kisses her in a more than friendly way after she's crowned the May Queen, and they cut to him during the final scene, when everyone is wailing in shared pain.

\- I think this is a really good example of social mores.  They could have tried to leave, like Simon and Connie.  Maybe they would have died, maybe not, but it's as if they didn't want to be rude to these people who had been so nice, and they didn't want to offend their friend, like social norms had programmed them to not be rude.  

\- I also agree that Christian wasn't a bad enough boyfriend to be burned alive, but he was her last link to the outside world, and her choosing between him and a villager was a test that she passed with the community.  I didn't mind the ending, honestly.  I mean, what was she going to do if she went home?  She had no family, she seems to have isolated herself from her friends, she's taken time off from school to deal with her grief, and there are going to be a lot of questions about where the men went.  There's a Stephen King short story in which every ten years (I think), this natural disaster happens, and people die.  Why wouldn't you move away?  Because in the intervening ten years, it's a really nice place to live.  I think Dani could tell herself that she'll never have to experience this again in her lifetime, and settle in to life there.",c7y18a

etpgus6,"
Please read knowing I am reading TOO much into this whole movie and just wanted to have FUN :) my interpretations are not correct, I just wanted to share my OWN thoughts. enjoy reading my overthinking

it was all planned. Every single thing in this movie was planned. The deaths of Dani’s family was just something that happened along the way. Or was it? 🤔. Just food for thought.

NOTE: Dani and Christian are the ONLY characters in the movie that are given last names, though I think Dani’s name has more meaning than Christian’s

Dani Ardor - Dani is a name meaning “God will judge.” Ardor is a noun meaning “strong emotion” or “passion”

Christian Hughes - Christian means “follower of Christ.” Hughes is derived from the welsh brittonic celt regions (Christian is a redhead).

Anyways, back to the “everything was planned” rhetoric.

• They purposefully excluded Dani from the trip to guilt Christian into inviting her.

• When they arrive, the elder said “Welcome Home” to Dani, while only saying “Welcome” to the rest.

• Pelle takes advantage of Christian not remembering Dani’s birthday and gives her his gift so they could create a deeper bond.

•During the May Queen celebration, how was it an OUTSIDER won May Queen, despite having no experience? Why didn’t any of the other girls who have participated many years won? They purposefully lost so Dani could win.

•The cult would separate Dani and Christian from each other to widen the rift that was already there and groomed him into having sex with Maja. (Simon and Connie had too close of a bond; therefore neither were eligible. I think this is why they got rid of them, other than the fact that neither had fair skin or blond(e)/red hair)

•The women LET Dani discover Christian having sex with Maja to deepen her hatred for him and manipulate Dani into “choosing” Christian to be sacrificed, almost like an illusion of choice. While Dani was having a panic attack, the girls wailed with her to sympathize and create a sense of unity. When Dani cried to Christian about her family, he never really comforted her. He just sat there while she cried on his lap. Dani crying with the girls furthers their bond.

•As Dani cries, she realizes the new family she has gained after losing everything else and begins to smile.

•ALSO! I think the “breathing” motions experienced in the trees and flowers throughout their trips is supposed to symbolize the cult’s own breathing. The rhythmic huffs, singing, etc. I think it’s also supposed to juxtapose to Dani’s panic attacks???? Their rhythmic breathing is used to help Dani.

Can we also talk about the fact that Pelle had groomed his friends for who knows how long and knew they were going to die the entire time? Does anyone know what the meaning of the scissors the girl put under the baby’s pillow?

EDIT: let’s not forget about the symbolism involving Dani’s family. Dani’s sister CHOSE to take her own life and the lives of her parents (during what type of weather? Snowy weather!!!), just how the people in the cult do when they approach their “winter”

Midsommar was amazing!!!!",c7y18a

It was scary to me, but not in the typical horror movie way. All three major traumas in Dani's life (bipolar sister killing herself/their parents, a toxic relationship with a gaslighting boyfriend and being immersed in a cult) are pretty much worse nightmare-level stuff for me. That said, the scene that REALLY scared me was when they first arrive in Sweden and we get to experience her drug-induced panic attack right alongside her including blurred/spinning vision and distorted sound and everything that felt way too much like a real life panic attack for comfort!

The 4 main characters' reaction on what was happening to their surrounding was so dubious.

I do want to enjoy the film and maybe knowing what happens, I might see it differently if and when I see it again.

Side note: did anybody start seeing faces in the trees once Dani became the May Queen. Maybe it began then, but when she was walking towards the table and you start seeing ""nature breathing"", there's a distinct face of the old man who landed on his feet.

I might check out the director's cut one day. Kinda hoping there was more with the boyfriend's friends. The movie didn't really delve into them but once they're killed off the movie becomes a lot less entertaining. I wish the movie did more with them.

Also who stole the book? It's brought up and never mentioned again.  That one guy gets murdered taking pictures of it and suddenly it's missing. I guess it's to manipulate the lead girl and her bf into think he ran of with it?

I enjoy movies that make you think and aren't always forthright with blatant explanations. They can be very enjoyable and I eagerly anticipate coming onto reddit and taking part in discussion of these films and seeing differing interpretations and perspectives that I may not have gotten myself.

So I certainly enjoy and appreciate films like that and don't always need a film to spell everything out for me. I love mindfuck movies.

Hell, i love the movie 'Stay' with Ryan Gosling which is a mindfuck movie.

I also enjoy thrillers and suspense. I don't always need action and slashers to enjoy a horror film. Psychological horror, suspense and thrillers are very fun for me and dialogue heavy movies also don't bother me as they can be very fun too.


But this movie was just.......pointless and boring....

None of the characters reacted in anything resembling a realistic way to anything going on with the exception of Connie and Simon.

Dani's character made literaly zero sense and by the time Christian drank the final drug laced drink before the sex ritual, i couldn't wait for him to die for being THAT fucking stupid when he already knew things weren't right.

Then shit like the cult telling Christian he was chosen to have sex with Maja and the pubes in his food and he didn't seem to think much of it. 

And his friends being oblivious as well to everything.

Everyone going missing one by one and they still trust the cult.

Then add in the entire film relying on just showing the cult being insane and weird. Long drawn out shots of nothing, tons of screams and moans and weird rituals for the sake of being weird. 

A 2.5 hour runtime for something that did NOT need to be 2.5 hours. And an ending that was seen coming from a mile away yet still makes no fucking sense why Dani is williningly joining a cult that just killed 9 people and she had her own boyfriend killed for cheating on her when she KNOWS the cult has been manipulating everyone and drugging everyone into doing weird shit they wouldn't do normally.

The entire movie just felt like someone being incredibly pompous about thinking they had some amazing intelligent movie and just trying to purposely be as weird, creepy and confusing as possible to make it seem like there was some bigger twist and meaning.

But in the end, the movie blatantly foreshadows EVERYTHING with about as much subtley as Maja's mating ritual. And you see every death coming from a mile away.

You know pelle is luring them to be sacrificed the second he reveals he's from the commune.

You know the old couple will die as soon as pelle says they all die at 72 and then they have their last supper.

You know simon and connie die the second they start shouting about wanting to leave. 

You know Mark will die for being obnoxious and pissing on the tree.

You know christian is gonna be enslaved into sex the second they show the sex spell drawing.

You know Josh is gonna get killed for being too curious as soon as he wants to do his thesis on them.

You know Dani is gonna be the may queen the moment they show the pictures of them and treat her special.

You know the cult is gonna sacrifice them all to appease their gods.

And you know the ending is gonna be wicker man 2.0.

There's literaly no intelligent build up to some unforseen twist.

The movie think it's more intelligent than it really is. It's again just really weird for the sake of being weird to act like there's some deeper meaning there. Like it wants to keep you guessing on what's going on but yet NOTHING is a surprise. We see it all coming from a mile away so there's no payoff because there's no guessing actually involved. All the weird shit is there just to be weird.

And it's overtly long for no reason.

I love intelligent movies that make me think and ponder the symbolism and look back on characters and their motivations and make me realize shit i didn't realize before.

This isn't one of those films yet it acts like it is.

And that's what i dislike so much about it.

It's like someone talking in a room full of people trying to act smart and clever to impress everyone but they're neither smart nor clever and just come off as a pompous tryhard braggart.

Just such a long and boring movie with no point or purpose that thinks it's more clever than it really is. When it's just overtly weird just to be weird.

I don't normally criticize shit this harshly but i can't help it after watchinh this.

First, Josh says he will be going there to do an ethnographic research on the commune. Did he not ask a lot of details first to Pelle? Like not using names and the locatjon. What kind of a thesis would that be?

Second, Mark is an anthro student too right? If not, he’s friends with who are and I guess he knows that he must be culturally sensitive. Why the fuck would he pee on a tree and act surprised when confronted?

Third, Christian is an asshole as revealed after his scene with Josh. He’s a selfish and unreliable friend. Then all that disappeared and he became sympathetic again for Dani (dinner scene).

Thoughts like that haunt a person forever.

esqlrkd,"Can't decide what to think of Midsommar. I definitely didn't like it as much as Hereditary, but there were things to appreciate in it that made it stand out for your usual Horror movie. It relies on building a slow creepy, unsettling atmosphere with these new group of people living with cultists on a day to day basis doing bizarre and unusual things in broad daylight. There's not really any scares per se and the gore/violence is there but sporadically placed. People went in my cinema expecting big things to happen constantly and ended up disappointed with it. I kind of liked the slow pacing of this movie, but I guess my biggest issue with it is not really caring much about the main characters. They didn't have much of a personality to me and I wished there was more to them. There were also weird elements of Comedy in there and it wasn't always obvious if it was funny or not, outside of that one guy being Comic Relief.

Probably no surprises coming from the director's previous movie Hereditary that Midsommar is beautifully shot with alot of artistic merit and themes scattered throughout the film's running time. I also noticed many similarities with The Wicker Man while I was watching, but at times this movie felt a bit aimless and meandering in places. It did feel quite bit predictable in where it goes with the plot, and the ending I saw coming a mile away and was hoping for something better than what we got. Despite that, the acting is solid and the music is good, as well as the production side of things. Overall, this is most likely going to be a very polarizing movie. Some will love the artsy side of the Horror, where as others will find it boring and self-indulgent. I can definitely see Midsommar being an improvement on a second watch too, as there's detail to catch in the background that could be missed on first watch. 6/10",c7y18a

When they’re tripping on mushrooms, Pelle starts to wax-poetic about nature saying something like”Nature just instinctually knows what to do.”  That got me thinking about the way everyone in the community attempts to express the same emotion or assimilates to function as an entire group (e.g., expressing pain when the dude fell from the cliff, vocalizing their grief with Dani after Christian was found cheating, moaning and crying at the very end when the sacrifices were being burned, etc.), almost like a hive mind. 

Does anyone else have thoughts about this? My thoughts are still very half baked. I was just thinking this assimilation could either point to their love of nature and their desire to mimic it or be more in tune with it. Also, Dani sees herself literally becoming apart of nature when she sees grass growing from her hand. It’s as though she has the most symbiotic relationship with nature above everyone else, making her a more obvious choice to be May Queen.",c7y18a

Especially how they all said ""Christian"" with a weird twang and the cultists pronounced ""Josh"" ""Yoshua"". I swear it's significant to the underlying religious/spiritual theme of Christianity VS. Paganism. Dani is the feminine for Daniel ( meaning ""God is my only judge"") so it makes sense in the climax, she picks Christian to be burned as of a sort of embracing of a new religion. 

Pelle is the Scandinavian interpretation of Peter. It reminded me of the ""denial of Peter"" which I thought could be the way Pelle was acting throughout the movie, being less of a bro and more of a creep towards Dani. He denies Christian(ity) by egging her to come and empathizing with her grief, where Christian neglected or shamed her.

In Midsommar, what is their motivation for them to do all these things? The movie wants to make us believe that the cult people stick to a celebration that occurs only every 90years so they have never experienced it before and the question arises what they were doing before they went to the camp to hold the celebration? We should also believe that Pelle is such a cold- hearted asshole that he befriends these American people knowing they are probably all going to die only because his cult wants to hold this celebration.",c7y18a

- Film mostly slow burns until the last half hour-ish, which is insane

- You know it's the climax because there are naked people standing around (but they're not hot, so it's unsettling)

There’s just so much detail in the set design and hidden things in the background that I’m sure I missed things. The practices around the inbred and the doctrine had me thinking the most:

Was the inbred mentally handicapped as well as physically? How much had he changed the doctrine, if at all? The elders said they interpreted his paintings so it’s hard to tell if he had anything to do with their beliefs at all. When they showed him watching the sex scene, it made me think that he was writing doctrine out of perversion.

* When Dani is on the couch crying in Christian's Lap there is a light blue painting of several ""moons"" to her left. It stood out to me for some reason.

* Josh said something alone the lines of ""You have no idea how much I invested in this"", and it just made me think he had something to do with getting everyone to tag along. The fact that he wasn't ""horrified"" to the point of leaving when he saw the jumpers from the cliff. The sleeping pills he kept giving Dani.

But at the same time, the direction is better from Aster, and that in no way casts shade on Hereditary which was superbly directed. This movie is striking, and it'll be a damn shame if there's no buzz for at least best director and cinematography (though it's early). He's got a way of burning scenes and moments in a person's mind. He's got at least three more moments like such in this movie. The sound effects and when he chooses to use them is frightening too.

On first watch, I think Hereditary is a better movie. With that said, I have only watched once because it is soooo draining.

How Josh's competitive streak essentially led to his death (whereas the commune doesn't fight or compete over anything). Dani felt isolated at the beginning, but by the end she had been utterly absorbed into this family, completely covered by flowers, which also completed the visual arc of her always hallucinating grass and other elements of nature becoming a physical part of her.

The audience is justified in having moral qualms about certain scenes and reactions to said scenes, but in the end, we're not here to judge moral fiber. I highly doubt Ari Aster meant to have a say about how ""cheating is bad!"" or ""don't be a dick!"" or ""there is only one real way to grieve,"" etc. As gratuitous as certain scenes felt, it would be too one-dimensional to chalk up those feelings to be ""You reap the consequences.""

We were watching characters that were extremely realistic and omnipresent in almost any community (whether it be college, grad school, work, or family. I know so many Marks, Christians, Josh, and Danis.) but they are still fictional and serve specific purposes in the movie. In the same line of thought, I believe the director meant for us to react the way we did. There's a reason something's called dark humor and not humor. And it was done well enough that the audience wasn't taking ""nothing"" seriously. We laughed when we were meant to.

What I loved about this movie was how my reactions felt tailormade for certain scenes. I also felt this was primarily about Dani's grieving. Whether or not the cult/community was manipulative (they most certainly were) or if Christian was justified in his distance or Dani was justified in offing Christian ...was beside the point.

Dani made her choice. As addled as she is throughout the movie (clouded by grief and substance), she is still aware of what has and will happen. She chose the crazy as f cult because the level of acceptance and camaraderie she ""believes"" she received from them far exceeded the one Christian and his friends had to offer. Has she made the right choice? Who knows. But I just know she's going to assimilate herself quite well into that shitshow.",c7y18a

eta4n1o,"So I need to rewatch this movie and in general I thought it was a fantastic, visually striking film. But I had some beef with it:

-They kept introducing elements that I thought would contribute more to the movie but ended up just being one-offs. The fact that it's sunny all the time is a mostly superficial conceit, name dropping Austin Powers and having no other examples of how the outside world intersects with their lives other than the strangers they bring to the festival. It seems that most of the drug scenes were more of an excuse to add an element of 'trippyness' to it that in my opinion wasn't necessary. 

-The fact that Christian is drugged at the end was a terrible choice IMO as it removes agency from his actions. It's clear he wanted to do all these things but it would have been more powerful if it was his choice to do this and not motivated by some inhibition reducing drug.

-I liked the humor, I just didn't get the point. I think it makes it easier for us to laugh at how ridiculous these people's crazy antics are and lessens some of the moral ambiguity about their way of life versus ours. Is Dani better off here than the outside world? 

-The answer of course is no and to people who are thinking that it is a happy ending, it isn't. A few details people miss, at the end they give 2 of the villagers chosen to sacrifice a salve that is supposed to ease their pain. It clearly doesn't, and reenforces the idea that their beliefs are founded on lies and superstition that results on unnecessary suffering. Remember when he says ""when you turn 72 *slit throat motion.*"" This implies that there is really no consent and they aren't actually giving their lives ""willingly"", they are being forced by the cult to kill themselves. Similarly, he mentions that he attempts to commiserate with Dani saying his parents burned to death in a fire but I think there's a good chance that his parents were killed as sacrifices in the temple. Thus his grief is a self-perpetuating one inflicted on him by the cult with the sole purpose being the cults self preservation. It creates grief and trauma so that it can be there for its victims with open arms, sharing their grief. Even their oracles are grotesque manifestations of their toxic dogma. 

Dani, like many who are seduced into cults, is clearly being taken advantage of. She is someone who is unable to support herself emotionally and has unfairly leaned on Christian (who's name is a piece of not-so-subtle symbolism) which is what drove him away from her to begin with. She's incapable of being alone, that's why she followed him and that's why she was so quick to join the cult, and now she never will have to learn that lesson. This movie is a CAUTIONARY tale about what happens when we loose our foundation of emotional support and the nefarious forces that can come in to fill that void.",c7y18a

I've not seen a lot of films do that quite like this yet, it was less like loudness building followed by dramatic silence, and more like just a cue for the audience to focus more severely.

I always found myself spouting WTF?! every 2 minutes or so just because I really don't grasp the absurdity of what's happening, but I guess that's how we all should feel or take in the film.

The end results of the choice may be the same (one being killed and the other living) but there is a difference between choosing to free a person who is guilty of crimes and choosing to sacrifice someone who simply drew the short straw.

Less scary but more *satisfying* and cohesive than Hereditary, IMO. 

There’s a lot about this movie that I just want to think about before I say anything more so I’ll just throw in praise for a few specific aspects I loved, and I’ll mention one thing that bugged me.

I loved that many of the deaths of the visitors happen offscreen - and we only learn something bad happened indirectly. many horror movies create their scares by killing off everyone on-camera with quick jumpscares. Here, for some of the major deaths you just have the dread of knowing it happened, and you don’t need to see it. 

I liked that some of the major emotional moments happened with no dialogue at all - just guttural sounds, or dancing. In hindsight kind of amazing how many scenes have almost no dialogue at all.  

Pretty fuckin insane journey for Dani’s character to go through, just thinking about where she starts and where she ends. I agree with another recent commenter - on paper, her storyline might not make sense but Pugh makes it work super well.

His visual flare is amazing as always. Feels like he got to indulge that much more here than Hereditary.

If there’s one thing I didn’t like, it’s the closeups repeatedly of the smashed faces. Felt gratuitous, whereas all the violence in hereditary, even at its most extreme, felt like it added something meaningful. I’m not sure this movie would’ve been any worse if we didn’t see a dude’s head smashed closeup.",c7y18a

Some details I noticed that I haven't seen mentioned before:

\- In the beginning, the guys smoke resin and eat pizza. This mirrors a lot of the meals at the commune–– drugs and eating.

\- The foreshadowing when Mark is complaining to Christian about Dani. Mark says ""you could be impregnating girls,"" and then he does just that.

\- In the first act, when Dani and Christian are having an argument back in her apartment about going to Sweden, there's a nice bit of choreography that happens subtly but purposefully. It starts with Christian standing on the left and apologizing for not telling her sooner about the trip, but within moments, their roles switch and they literally switch places. Dani moves to the left and Christian to the right, and Dani starts apologizing for even bringing it up. It happened so fluidly it almost goes unnoticed.

Just the way Christian (the name can't be an accident) pretends to be supportive and loving with Dani, but really isn't and actually gaslights her and makes her constantly question her own instincts and connection to reality, as opposed to the cult, which is clearly harking back to a pre-Christian era of nature-worship (nature is, after all, beautiful but also really cruel) and is so welcoming and inviting and seductive, especially to a person like Dani who is so desperate for connection.

Visually it's very well done, nice color grading and very good cinematography. The soundtrack was great, one of the best I've heard in a bit. Sound editing in general was nailed down. The story, oh the story... Basically it's a movie about a cult that sucks in some innocent American students that go into the ""adventure"" for different reasons and end up in a very fucked up scenario. It was a looooong development but I think that's what the director was going for, it wasn't really about the ending (which I saw coming from miles away), but about the process of how we got there. A lot of the scenes were build in the way of ""show, don't tell"", which denotes good qualities in story-telling. I'm really impressed how anxious it made me feel, it would just keep building and building. To compare it with Hereditary, I'd say they're somehow similar in the aspect of suspense, although the former had more depth and layers to the story. It's definitely a great movie, nothing game changing but damn impressive. 9/10",c7y18a

First off, good god, is this movie quiet. There's multiple entire scenes with no foley, just the voices of the characters and maybe some soundtrack and that's it. No birds chirping, no wind, and definitely no footsteps

At the very beginning of the movie when Dani's leaving the  voicemail to her parents, you can see their answering machine starts a timer of how long the call's been going as the camera starts to pan away from it. I thought it was strange that they would specifically use a machine with a timer as that's not something you often see, so I took note of what number it reached before it was out of view in case it was somehow important later.

esroelk,"Just saw this a few hours ago, and at first I wasn't too happy with it, but that's because I expected to see Hereditary, but that's not what this film was suppose to be.

One theme that I noticed from Hereditary was the ""grooming"" of the main character. In Hereditary, the family is guided from the very beginning to suffer for Paimon while in Midsommar, Dani is groomed to be reborn and given a new family. This was evident when she is tripping, but sees her feet (on several occasions) growing into the ground like a plant.

There's a lot of disappoinment in how slow the movie was, but it felt very realistic because while we experienced this movie in under three hours, the characters endured a lot longer. I was very impressed when I found out Dani and Christian were dating just over four years. The way he made her feel and talk, made it seem that they were a brand new couple and she was scared she'd push him away when in actuality, he should have been her rock.

I do wonder how much of Dani's emotions and decisions were a result of her family passing away earlier and the constant ""trips"" she was taking from all the different drugs the community kept giving her.

I was confused at the mentioning of the game ""Skin the fool"". Early on, a large group of the community was dancing to this game. However, later on the one guy was killed, skinned and given a jester or fool hat before his remains were burned. Was this just forshadowing? Or did it have more significance and enforce the theme of ""grooming"" it's victims?

In the end, I wasn't left horrified and disturbed like after Hereditary, but I do enjoy a movie that heviky borrows from the Wicker Man.",c7y18a
esrrtxk,"God I loved this. Absolutely hysterical and completely fucked up. I've never seen anything that looks like it. Aster has such a firm grip on style and pace. The way he gradually dials up the tension until the explosive and outrageous final act was incredible to watch.

Also I saw this opening night in a crowded theater and it was an incredible experience. Everyone was absolutely loving it and were almost always laughing or gasping. Also a lot of mutterings of ""what the fuck"". But that was with a receptive audiences likely filled with other film buffs who couldn't wait to see this.

It's very unlikely she'd be ovulating even if she had finished her period on the drink day. Unless it wasn't period blood? I'd have to see the tapestry again.

et0go70,"Some observations. Pelle said the ritual happens every 90 years, but also shows a pic of the queen from last year. He also says he parents died in a fire, maybe implying they burned in a yellow barn. But if that's what happened, it couldn't have been 90 years ago because that's too long. So something is off.

I think when he says 90 years, what he means to say is that it's a rare occurrence, and also to use it as a pull to bring the students in. At first I thought it was a all planned setup. But I think the thing is it's not guaranteed. If the students hadn't acted like jerks, they wouldn't have been killed. If Dani hadn't had been in the situation she was in (her family dying and her needing comfort) to empathize with the cult and synchronize with their dancing, she would not have been queen. Odds are that a cult member becomes the May queen each year, not the newcomer. The newcomers were just the right ones this year such that all conditions were met.

Another thing I noticed that I haven't seen discussed is that there is a theme of choices in the movie, under a background of unfortunate circumstances. In the end of the movie, the old man asks Dani who she wants to kill and tells her she has a ""choice"". This is juxtaposed with a lottery ball choosing who the cult member is. Dani makes her choice. Choices crop up in other areas. Note that the characters aren't forced to make any decisions. There is no magic in the movie. They all act like jerks, drink the potions, follow someone, or cheat of their own free will. Christian makes conscious decisions to drink the potions and have sex. There's a background of randomness and plotting against them - but they still make the decisions themselves.

Something else I noticed that I haven't seen discussed much is the movies depiction of disabled and non-white race. Does anyone else have any thoughts on this? In the beginning of the movie someone makes a comment on how the Vikings took advantage of people. This seems related. Three of the newcomers are minorities. The oracle is disabled. Christian becomes disabled at the end of the movie. The non-white people, the newcomers, are killed, and so is Christian, who is disabled. The oracle's ""writings"" are ""interpreted"" by the leaders. On some level is there a hint of white domination in the movie in how a queen arises? On the other hand, the newcomers do make their own choices that lead to their fates, perhaps suggesting that their backgrounds are not the whole story, their choices are also.",c7y18a

It is much more of a slow burn though, it felt it's run time. And the burn didn't get quite to where Hereditary got. 

But I noticed something about Ari Aster's films as well as his short he did for film studies, besides the naked old people, it has to do with grieving the loss of family members in each film and the usual five steps. Midsommar was Depression and Acceptance by the end with how Dani was smiling and of course the screaming and crying by the village and Dani. Hereditary was Denial and Bargaining with the seances and trying to contact the daughter and believing that she wasn't truly dead and doing anything to get her back. The Johnsons was anger due to the son just being so mad and violent towards his mother after his father's death

That being said, it was basically The Wicker Man but set in Sweden instead of Scotland. It was far too long and there are way better cult movies out there. The Sound of My Voice being one example.

What I didn't understand was about the scriptures, and how they knew to follow them if it happens only every 90 years, and no one in the commune lives past 72, so the instructions are only created through the rubix cube ...rubi-something. The point being I don't understand if they are following a translation of an inbreed who is specifically chosen to be insane to write their scripture, that the original scriptures are meant to be an "" evolution""...and the new scribe only has pictures and the priests interpret it..WTF? Also did someone really steal the holy scripture?  And third, did Dani, just completely lose her mind at the end?

I didn’t experience the unease other people did (except the suicide scene). I felt mellowed out and strangely attracted to this truly absurd cult. 

It’s a detailed, hazy exploration of community, loss, religious ecstasy, loneliness, rebirth, etc... I loved the mix of moods here—manic absurdity, humor, horror, warmth, despair, joy. I know critics have complained about the pacing and length, but I loved the hypnotic, loose way the story unfolded.

It was refreshingly unique. 

Florence Pugh did an incredible job. Her expressions kept me hooked the entire time. Will Poulter was also great as your bog standard douchecanoe. I feel like William Jackson Harper was a bit wasted in his role. I’d like to see him in more things.

I love that the temptation the “devil” offered her was comfort and empathy, not sex, wealth, or any of the other common tropes in tales of innocence corrupted. It’s easy to imagine falling for that, especially in our vulnerable moments. “Do you feel held?” Wonderful line.

I could see some Von Trier in this for sure. One thing I like about his work is that he often explores the violence of rejection and cold rationality in the face of pain and emotional expression. Seems like a theme in this movie too.

My one complaint is that the death of her family felt a little under-developed. This made it harder to empathize with Dani’s pain. But it didn’t take away from my overall enjoyment.

I loved the art direction, the bright colors, the symmetrical composition of many shots. Pretty much all the things you would normally not see in a horror movie. This is what it would look like if Wes Anderson directed a horror movie.

Contrary to what others are saying here, I think the script was very tight and well-crafted. There is plenty of good foreshadowing and all the little details that pop up at the beginning come back around later if you pay attention. It's not a ""scary"" movie, but it is deeply disturbing and a very, very slow burner but the payoff is good. It's incredibly artsy and there's a....uh.....""climax"" (wink wink) that seemed very avant garde, bordering on pretentious.

et9i8l0,"This is the first and only movie I have ever seen that depicts a psychedelic experience so accurately and vividly on camera (honorable mention, ""Mandy"" w/ Nicolas Cage). It was absolutely stunning. Either Ari or someone else on his team are no stranger to drug use of any type - A great example of this is at the very beginning of the movie, when Christopher tells Dani during their first phone call that he and Mark just smoked some ""resin"" and ordered a pizza. This is a small tidbit that was added, but any broke college student can relate to the feeling of having to revert to scraping your bowl to get by. 

Not only were the visuals stunning, but the way the characters reacted on their first trip was spot on:  
""I'm going to lay down. Yeah, it feels good laying down. Josh, can you please lay down too?!"" & ""New person coming..."" - such accurate representations of the typical white boy that is not handling their shit very well (aka me). Another great line was when Christopher was starting to lose his marbles at the final dinner when he looks at the old man and says ""What is going on...?"" and is then hit with the CLAP. Might I add, the way he was sitting, lurched over the table with his hands in his lap, shaking, with eyes like an owl constantly looking back and forth at Dani was an impeccable performance by Jack Reynor. I could feel the anxiety that was rushing over him.

The score and overall audio that paired with the psychedelic experiences were gripping. The augmented sounds/murmuring that you could hear when a character was laser focused was spot on as well. It really drove your anxiety and made it feel like you were a part of their journey. The slight variances in facial features and the pulsating and waving of the flowers, trees, grass, and objects were about as close to a trip as you can depict. I constantly caught myself searching the screen for different objects that were changing. It was captivating and made the experience of the movie much more suspenseful. 

This movie really, and let me stress REALLY hits home with viewers that have tripped fuckin' nuts before. I would imagine much more so than a person who has not. Let's hope other directors use this as a crash-course for putting the psychedelic phenomenon on the big screen. Cheers to never tripping again -",c7y18a

Outsiders who are aware of such a tragedy are scarred and want to be removed from the situation entirely but the members realize it is the natural order of things. Outsiders have similar experiences to draw from but the real thing never cuts as close.

Both of his movies center around a family experiencing necessary sacrifice. This makes me believe Aster has felt this and wants to bring it to the screen in the most real way he knows how (and god damn he does it so well). 

The real horror of this film is ritualism and normality of death from an outsiders perspective. A great film in that it loudly gets its message across.",c7y18a
etr6o63,"There was one thing that I felt would have really added to the film. They briefly mention going through Stockholm and are told that it's in the wrong direction. I wish this had been changed. Give us one night in the city showing modern Swedes and the rest of the group celebrating midsummer in a much more familiar fashion: drugs, dancing, sex... maybe even a sauna as a hangover remedy if you want to go *really* on the nose.

esonkte,"After thinking about it all night, I feel like it is hinted that Pelle orchestrated Dani's family death.

\- Both Pelle and his brother/friend (who brought Simon and Connie) were infatuated with the two girls they brought. Of course, bringing the girls ran the risk of them becoming sacrifices, but they also both could have been made May Queen which would grant them entrance into the ""family."" So to them, it was worth bringing girls they liked. So he would have an incentive to make her go. And losing her entire family would make her more welcoming of a new family and new life.

\- And in the beginning when Dani is worried about her sister after receiving the email, she even states; ""It doesn't sound like her, even Christian thought so"" Talking specifically about the way it was worded. But I feel like they wouldn't have included this tidbit if it **wasn't** significant. 

\- Also, the entire setup of the suicide/murder was fairly complex. Someone whose is depressed with outbursts/bi-polar would probably be more likely to do something rash and not so well thought out. The tubes from the car upstairs to both rooms, plus the duct tape on the floor, would take time and someone whose experiencing a mental breakdown probably wouldn't be as likely to go through all of those steps so neatly and precise. It was a very clean scene, very methodical. 

\- The shot of Dani's sisters face (covered in throw up and duct taped to the tube) just felt odd. I think it would be really challenging for someone to go through with that, it was just very surreal. Especially if the person was pretty infamous for seeking attention and sympathy rather than seriously hurting themselves. 

I mean, it's very possible that she killed herself & her parents, but I think it's also possible that Pelle played a part in this because he had already met Dani and probably liked her at that point, and knew that this would drive her into Christians arms even more so because of her codependency. Which is inevitably what drives her to accept this new family of hers. Also, he's obviously not the most trusting person, even if most everything he said was indirectly truthful or not a flat-out lie.",c7y18a

esyafo0,"I took 3 caps of Shrooms before entering the movie, oddly enough I started peaking when the main characters decided to take mushrooms as well.  There were a couple moments where I thought maybe this was a bad idea but I have to say I feel like I was part of Dani's Journey (in a good way).  I currently am in a relationship 3 years in (engaged) and ever since the engagement my partner has noticeably shifted his personality and has become inconsiderate, judgmental, and rude. I have mentioned couples consoling many times to work on things but he always refuses.  While watching this movie though I felt like I was in Dani's shoes, constantly feeling let down by our partner and what it means to lack empathy. Its not until the last half hour of the film where you see Dani forced into the dance where for once the audience sees Dani crack a smile.  Although her character was uncomfortable and slightly embarrassed, it was genuinely great to see her look like she was having fun and letting go of past trauma.  Her boyfriend refuses to look at her or admire her, he refuses to care about her from the very beginning as its a chore for him to be around her.  Christians character lacks any empathy, even with his friends by wanting to steal the idea of doing a thesis on the festival.  If anything, by the end of the movie I wasn't left in a state of shock like I was with Hereditary, I was left with enlightenment.  I feel like maybe its time to end my current relationship (as hard as It may be) to continue a new season of my life to grow again and let go of what has been holding me down.   This movie could of taken an easy slasher route near the end to have the characters trying to escape the festival but instead it dives into a much more emotional journey of the main character. 10/10",c7y18a

f1gs0er,"The more I've thought about the movie since seeing it, the less and less I like it. With the exception of the main actress who is phenomenal, the acting is forgettable. The cinematography is good but 2.5 hours of cinematography doesn't make a movie.

And straight up this was some of the worst writing I've seen in a movie. The characters who were plain to begin with don't act remotely believable or are, at best, next-level stupid. 

The plot was extremely weak with nothing surprising or very interesting (plus some problematic aspects). You can predict the rest of the movie with like 90% accuracy as soon as they get there.",c7y18a
f22lk9z,"What a disappointment. I didn't relate to any of the characters and their (improbable) behavior and reactions to insane shit unfolding around them therefore I didn't give a shit when they eventually died. 


Am I supposed to care about a vaping dudebro who's just an annoying comic relief (in what's supposed to be a psychological slow burner horror) or the redhead who's totally oblivious and betrays his friends at nearest opportunity or the black guy who's only worry in life seems to be his master thesis? All that despite just seeing two people off themselves? Seems like the english couple had the only proper, believable reaction but they're gone almost immediately. The rest of the movie is just useless because none of the remaining characters are relatable. Just an endless slideshow of idiots ignoring red flags. 



Doesn't help that you can pretty much predict the whole movie just by reading what it's about. But that doesn't have to be detrimental if done right. This however was not done right. During Hereditary I felt great tension throughout the film. Here I felt nothing. I just didn't care.",c7y18a

The psychedelic effects. Mark starting to have a bad trip at the beginning, telling people to lie down, was hilarious. Most realistic depiction of a bad trip I've seen. There was a lot of humour if the film which was a surprise, but a welcome one. I found it didn't take away from the tense atmosphere at all. It was sprinkled in little bits throughout the film.

I think it's bittersweet that Ari Aster said he isn't going to be doing more horror after this one. Yes, both of his movies so far have been similar in theme, with a cult doing cultish things, but I'm still in. Give me more.

Some people have complained about the length of the movie. I was totally okay with it but the people I went with mentioned it was a little long. To each his own. It was nearly three hours so it is a little on the long side. You have to enjoy slow burn to enjoy this movie as the tension build up over time.

SPOILERS AHEAD KINDA
**********

I loved it! I’ve been a big fan of almost every horror movie A24 has put out and this was no exception.

The more I think about it the more fascinated I am by it. One point I noticed was that the outsiders are all pretty shitty, even if in subtle ways. Christian was the most overt, he doesn’t appear to be a good boyfriend at all and comes off as an insensitive ass. Mark is funny but is immediately negative about the land and pokes fun at the traditions, literally pissing on them at one point. Josh oversteps boundaries between trying to be an academic and being disrespectful.  Of course, what the cult is doing is horrific and strange in many ways but they’re almost portrayed neutrally, just as a community doing their thing unbothered. 

It’s only Dani who welcomes the traditions, mostly because as we see, she’s vulnerable and wanting for belonging, culminating in her partaking in the dance and participating in the ritualistic murders herself. 

It was beautifully shot. When Dani is covered in flowers head to toe and dancing maniacally at the end in front of the fire it was unlike any other scene i can remember seeing, I felt floored by it. 

It’s 100% not for everyone and I can respect someone not enjoying it but I thought it was a wild ride and looked great all the way through.",c7y18a

* Letter : D
* Symbol : The Day
* Element : Fire and Air
* ""Dagaz, the last rune of Futhark means literally ""Day"". This rune symbolizes the fulfillment and achievement. Dagaz is the rune of the awakening, of dawn and of the day rise. The rebirth in the Light. Dagaz also symbolizes the fulfillment at the end of the initiatory path.""
* Divinatory value : New vision of the situation. A change for the better. Constraint.

Mark is a disrespectful frat-bro type who is easily lured away by one of the women after the scene where he pisses on their ancestral tree. Josh respects the cult's practices, but is too focused on his research. When he tries to secretly break the no-photos rule, he's killed. Christian's insecurity in his relationship makes him more willing to cheat. Afterwards he's shocked at what he's done and runs off, leading to him being caught by the cult, and then his death.

It actually showed off Aster's versatility a lot more than I was expecting it to.\* Besides that I also enjoyed the spectacle of the film, particularly the choreography and excellent cinematography and sets (it actually seemed more ambitious and grandiose than the Midway movie Roland Emmerich is making, which I bring up because the trailer played during the adverts. Though most of that boils down to Aster being an actual artist and a much more technically skilled filmmaker on every level). I'd say it's a film I'll have to rewatch a few more times to develop a full appreciation of it, but I'd still probably say that Hereditary was the better movie (though since that's one of the best horror films of the past half century, that's not meant as a slight against this movie). In many ways it reminds me of the feeling I have watching a lot of David Lynch's work for the first time, not really fully understanding it, but being entirely engrossed and usually enjoying it more with repeat viewings after coming to understand the narrative themes and the more obscure elements of the plot.

You could just allow the visuals, music, and feelings to wash over you.

That being said, part of me was a little disappointed that the movie didn't take the time to explore more of the actual cult itself. Dani can't be the first outsider they've brought in to join, can she? What would a conversation with someone who joined 1-2 years ago sound like? How do they survive winter?

No sinking realizations, no moments of horror, it's just a weird comedy with people you don't really care for save for the main actress, and even then her character pretty much gives up by the end*

Besides the first jump, the freakiest part of the movie was me seeing a face in the tree after she wins the competition and the realization that he's drinking period blood. There's no cathartic climax, it just maintains after William Jackson Harper gets bonked on the head.

This film is at best a 6/10.

In Hereditary, he was making a point about how mental illness is inherited from our parents and because of this we are at the mercy of forces beyond our control, and used the demon Paimon to partially stand-in for those forces.

&#x200B;

Having thought about it, I think this movie was about how people with mental illness and trauma are susceptible to succumbing to religious fanaticism.  The thing I liked is that there was nothing supenatural going on in this film: it was just a group of people who were doing horrific things in the name of their religious tradition.  Aster hits home these themes by constantly juxtaposing the community's beliefs with reality: we're told the couple who die at the cliff gave their lives happily, but they were tearing up in the ceremony before hand.  They told the two who sacrificed themselves in the tent that the yew would ease their pain, but they start screaming when the fire reaches them.  They believed the ancestor tree harkened back to their loved ones, but it was a dead tree: their traditions were shown there not to be rooted in anything real.  

&#x200B;

Dani, because of her vulnerable situation, has now adopted their viewpoint and is enjoying the celebration in which her friends have been murdered.  This isn't because Dani is messed up, but because she's deeply human, and the real horror is that it wouldn't be unrealistic or exceptional for a person to come around to this thinking.

&#x200B;

I'm sure there's plenty of other little eggs and things hidden in the background regarding this: Ari Aster obviously spent so much time finely crafting the details in this movie.

What does the theater do as soon as we get power back? They rewind it just before the lady gets her face obliterated by that rock.. For such a nasty moment, I couldn’t help but laugh.

ete5glf,"My take that I haven't much thought through yet is that the film is about isolation and the costs of not belonging to a community. Almost all the people who visit the commune are absorbed in themselves or don't care for others, and they all die because of it. 

Dani's boyfriend is an obvious example. From the beginning of the movie he talks about breaking up with Dani, and forgets her birthday. He's not even that loyal to his close friends; he steals his friend's thesis. Most of the friends are primarily concerned with themselves and their own interests. Everyone who gets killed wanders off by themselves, isolating themselves from the rest of the group. 

The cult are polar opposites, they're devoted to their community and willing to sacrifice themselves for each other. They are in tune with the legacy of their ancestors. They think about other people, not just themselves. Pelle was the one to remember Dani's birthday. He asks her ""do you feel held by him?""

Dani survives because she yearns for human connection and community. She begs for Christian not to leave her in the beginning. She participates in the cult activities and joins their group. 

The twist is that while the cult is on it's face grotesque and terrifying, its members are part of a happily integrated community, as opposed to the friends who are isolated from one another because they come from a culture of self-promotion and individualism.",c7y18a

I absolutely love this movie.    
This ritualistic, folk-horror theme is unique.   
After the Ättestupa took place, I started to understand how everything was normal for the commune.   
There was no evil in their actions. It really was a celebratory ritual.  

Once you really wrap your head around this, the alienation of our ""protagonists"" becomes a lot more intense.

esutssv,"Hear me out, there's something really wonderful happening with bees in this movie (maybe). Like, really wonderful (maybe) -- it's one of those background things, that won't take up the bigger spaces of the film's analyses, but I wanted to share it 1) I like bees and 2) I'm a beekeeper so if I can make a stretch for bees anywhere, I will. And, idk, maybe there's substance in this reading maybe there isn't, but I don't think the following reading hurts the narrative, just adds to it: You've got the cult of the island in the Wickerman where bees are both sacred and a form of punishment. There's some matriarchal stuff happening in that society as well. And now you've got...well, a cult, sort of, in Midsommar where the *absence* of bees in the film speaks volumes too. The abundance of paganism, green growing things, and flowers, especially, always leads me back to bees -- from what we know about them through science and how society has leaned on bees for symbolism. Disclaimer: I'm gonna play hard and fast with how I talk about bees, but I've been keeping them for about four years and have loved them for longer than that. other beeks please don't go in too hard if I'm being generous/broad technicals.  

There's gnats and mosquitos in a lot of the outside scenes -- there's a *plethora* of flowers. The minute they get to Pele's place (PP!), they're slapping themselves and complaining about bugs and ticks. During the outside dinner scenes, you can see insects fly around their sweaty skin. The bodies will later be stuffed with flowers, because that's a nice carryover aesthetic from Hereditary and it's just cool as hell looking. But they're food for the insects in more ways than one. 

I aspire to reach that god tier May Queen super saiyan form at the end where you're just a cone of flowers. But, go back a bit, there's only one scene I can recall where a bee actually shows up on screen. Everything else in the background is a blur except Dani, with her flower crown, and this bee gently landing on her crown while she's being led to her chariot to go bless the earth. There's so much screen time and careful framing that it was hard for me not to think about that bee. It might not be a big deal, but Dani doesn't complain about any of the insects, I don't think she participates in the tick scene. There's a flower on her crown that continually opens and closes in a sort of psychedelic, sexual way, and it stops after the bee has landed on her. Dani = Queen, Bee = Queen Bee, easy stuff here. 

One fascinating aspect about queen bees is that virgin queens only need to do their mating dance once a season, and then they're set to lay the colony's eggs until production stops for winter -- eggs become brood which becomes workers, nurse bees, drones, etc.. You can introduce new queens into a colony when the colony isn't doing well, or when the colony needs new genetics. The old queen can be pinched or they can be replaced by the first new virgin queen that hatches; the new, young queen will kill any other queen cells that were made to ensure her success and fight the old queen. The virgin queen's job is to get mated and then lay eggs. The movie even makes a point to mention inbreeding and introducing new genes into the small community, by the end we figure its through unsuspecting tourists who are drugged or lured into lowering their defenses. Any egg in it's first three days of being laid can be turned into a queen cell; the wax that makes their cell is shaped differently than the other types of bees, and to turn that larvae into a queen bee is the difference between regular bee food and royal jelly. I noticed that on arrival, when everyone's being offered their first round of drugs, only Dani drinks the tea in a white cup while the rest of the guys chew their mushrooms. All the girls participating in the dance have the potential to be May Queen. They all drink the same special punch, but the one that's got the most stamina remains. You want a strong queen, with people or bees. shrug. 

Christian is a drone, a male bee -- someone coming into the film might think he'd be the one baiting or chasing after a woman outside of his relationship with Dani, but he's actually the one that is coerced and eventually led into the mating. There's that scene in the beginning where one of the guys makes a pointed remark about how he could easily just have sex with another, more willing girlfriend if he dumped Dani. An audience would expect Christian to follow through on this foreshadowing and eventually find someone else, but the movie sort of subverts that by having him be led away and taken, physically and, uh, physically. Anyway: Drones serve only reproductive purposes in the bee colony. We thought Mya would might be smitten with him but in the end, its the coupling in the presence of the other women and the bond that comes from that that seems to give her satisfaction. Semen acquired, colony benefits, bye Christian. Queens don't mate with the drones inside their own hives. They fly out and find other drones and then come back to their home colony. The drones don't produce honey, but they consume it and take up valuable bee resources that could be used elsewhere -- so when the season ends in the fall, you'll see the female worker bees driving the males out of the colony. They're either killed or left to die in the cold, literally. I know this is the part of my analysis that sort of gets muddy since Mya gets mated but Dani's the queen. I don't know, I'll think about it and maybe follow up later. 

When queens mate with a drone, they do a little buzzy dance in the air and he inserts the equivalent of his bee penis into her -- depositing his genetic material. The queen, I guess, says thank you and then proceeds to rip out his entire lower abdomen. She carries his genetic materials, and the rest of his goods, off with her while his body spirals in the air to crash as a carcass; his purpose served. To date, I'm not aware of any drones that have been stuffed into bear costumes, but idk bees be bees. I guess Jack Reynor's frantic run around the compound with his floppy overbaked hotdog could count as a drone's frantic mating dance and its subsequent climax before death. 

Anyway. It's obviously not a MAJOR point of the movie or anything...but it's a fun connection or reading that could be made. Bees are cool. Flowers are cool. I liked this movie a lot. Thanks. Edited for typos",c7y18a

I related a lot with the main character, dealing with pain alone is wrenching.

Back to the point though, when that bear was cut open it looked awfully a lot like a vagina, and Christian was placed back into it.

etftmnw,"I have a weird theory about colors foreshadowing various characters’ fates in this movie: gold/blonde represents the sun (god), red is the flesh (killing/mating), and blue is being marked for death.

Almost all the guys in the group and the UK couple were wearing mostly blue in the movie, except for Christian, who was wearing blue jeans and a maroon t-shirt. Maroon is red mixed with blue, which kind of represents his being used for mating and, later, sacrifice. 

The wisecracking one was completely clad In blue jeans and a deep-blue t-shirt when the village girl—in a dress trimmed in red—led him away to be killed offscreen.) 

The truck we see at the end is painted blue. The barn where all the kids stayed had big blue doors.

The back of the swan-diving elders’ chairs at the dining table were blue with some gold leaf. The clothing of those who carried their chairs was blue.

Another thing was interesting about the cap of the woman who interviewed Christian about being a potential mate: at the beginning it was a simple head covering, then a puffy red band was added to it around the time the girl slid the rune under Christian’s bed. By the end, the woman’s cap had three puffy red bands. It’s as if her cap became more vaginal, as if something were in the process of being birthed from the cap throughout the movie.

I think that beige might have stood for wisdom, as the book worm, Dani, and the elders seem to wear it throughout the movie. It was also the color of the paper of the sacred texts.

For some weird reason, the other outside visitors at the opening ceremony disappeared over the course of the film without being mentioned/seen again, either dead or alive. The small commune children (under 10 yrs) completely disappeared too, though maybe they were just ushered off to see more *Austin Powers.*

I don’t believe for a minute that the yew sap did anything to sooth the pain of the two commune volunteers; rather, I think it might have been some kind of a placebo to make them think that their deaths would be painless so that they remained inside when the fire started; once the flames hit them I think that they realized it was rather a paralyzing agent to keep them from escaping.",c7y18a

I really enjoyed it. That's my initial impression, however, it was much different from what I was expecting and much less.... horror than I was expecting? It's interesting that Aster chose to have a lot of the terrible things happen off screen, like the murder of Mark and the quick disposal of Josh. I was also surprised that there was essentially no scifi/fantasy involved.

Cinematically it's definitely the most beautiful horror film I've ever seen. Really beautiful shots and scenery and great use of closeups to create tension. I especially loved the early scene where they were driving in and the camera slowly goes upside down. it's a gorgeous movie.

Overall it's not a movie I'd probably watch on my own again, but if friends wanted to see it I'd be more than happy to watch it with them. I'd say the biggest similarity to Hereditary that Midsommer has is that there's so much context that you have to look up after the movie. You could tell that there were a ton of clues and just straight up mythology that you'd need to research on your own.

I've noticed the theme of responsibility popping up - Hereditary, Annie even specifically talks about her son owning up to his actions in killing his sister, all the while not owning up to her own role in the horror surrounding them, refusing to recognize her own shortcomings. Her son ends up taking a lot of this baggage personally, and, well, it ends badly. 

It seemed in Midsommar we got some of this again. Even for something as small as Will Poulter's character refusing to take blame for pissing on a sacred tree because he didn't know and it was 'just a dead tree'. Dani's BF too ends up turning his mistakes around, making her apologize for his fuckups. Same with when he ends up in that ritualistic sex scene, he took the drugs in what seemed to me a move that would make it like his actions weren't  really his responsibility.  He also played a bit of a victim when he told his friend he was doing his thesis on the same shit his friend was doing it on. He was all ""bro, why are you being a dick? I want to collaborate.""

etedloi,"So there were runes littered across this movie and I am a sucker for symbols so I tried to remember them any time they popped up and googled them when I got home.

They look to be Viking ruins, fitting since this is set in Sweden.

The Two runes that stood out the most to me were the ones Danni had on her multiple times. They showed up twice in my memory, once in the drawing the guy that brought him drew of her and once sewn on her dancing frock. They were the 'R' looking one -the internet is telling me is called ""Raidho"" and the hour Glass- which I believe is ""Dagaz"". I was curious about thier meanings (according to my best googling) means journey/travel/evolution and Dawn/breakthrough/awakening respectively which I think encapsulated her character.

Other symbols that stood out to me were:

- the table being set up as ""Othala"" (literally the name of the village) which means heritage, heirlooms, land of  birth. 

- ""Pertho"" showed up at some point. I think relating to the book where everything was written (mysteries, secrets, occult abilities)

-""Hagalaz"" was carved into the bottom of the foot in the garden (wrath of nature)

- the ladies during the fertility  blessing made an ""ingwaz"" in the dirt. It then cuts to the sex scene (it means male fertility, gestation, internal growth)

- I also saw a""berkano"" which is like  birth/fertility/growth somewhere.

Please tell me I wasn't the only one who saw these!!! Can anyone else confirm?",c7y18a

After that, I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of the film. Acting, cinematography, and even plot was beautiful. Then comes the second half, and I just couldn’t help but feel like they were trying too hard? In a way that just honestly left me frustrated with the movie. I felt like they took the potential it had and just screwed itself over in the last 30 or 45 minutes.

I think I also missed out on a line in dialogue at the end. The last ceremony was supposed to have 9 victims, but I could only count 3 from Dani's party, 2 Brits and 2 Hårga volunteers.

My one big problem with the film is that I simply didn't buy the way the friends interacted with one another when shit started going down. Josh/Christian especially seemed way too passive. For a group that seemingly wasn't aware of the Pagan rituals going into the trip, they were way too accepting. IRL if you saw two people commit suicide and two other tourists randomly go missing and then one of your friends isn’t in bed in the morning you’d probably not be like “yah lets drink this tea and eat”.

esnrczu,"So...here's my thoughts:

&#x200B;

The film, from a technical standpoint, is pretty much perfect. Every shot is so well executed and thought out. It was a gorgeous film and the color palette was great. I also loved the lead actress, she was very captivating and just gave an amazing performance. The story was good, but most of the beats were a little too similar to every other pagan cult movie. Even if they had their own twist. I loved the way the film dealt with family trauma, depression, and grief. I think Ari Aster knows how to play with those themes in his films well. I really liked all the characters but I feel that other than Dani and Christian, the other characters' story arcs weren't played out quite as much as I would want them, especially Will Poutier's character. I think this film is stagnant for too long. There is a good 20ish minutes that the story doesn't go much of anywhere and it kinda just felt stagnant, especially after starting out so powerfully and intense the first hour. I liked the ending and got it (I think at least lol). I also think there were just a lot of missed opportunities in the story, characters I wish I would've known more about/learned more, etc. The film IS a horror film but it really really really doesn't feel like one. There were moments where Aster could've taken the story to a place of dread and terror. It felt like he was purposefully pushing against that, which is cool, but I would've liked to see the story give in a little more to its horror elements towards the end, because the film ends in a way that almost doesn't feel like it has a payoff due to this. Overall, I think this film is good. Its a 7/10 for me. I may have had too high of expectations since Hereditary, because THAT film literally had me driving home from the theater just feeling so dreadful and sick. This film didn't elicit much of a reaction from me tbh. It felt like it was missing just a little something. I really wanted to leave the film feeling in a way one way or another. Feeling dread, anything really. It just left me a LITTLE void of that. Still, a very well done film.",c7y18a

esr6wl6,"The SOUND DESIGN. This movie has to be seen with a great sound setup. There are moments where I thought someone in the audience was talking behind me. Dani's endurance dance and the moment she asks to learn how speak Swedish are unreal. The sound design literally created an out of body experience for me. 

Dani's deep and gut wrenching cry as her family's death is learned harmonizes with the droning Swedish music and brought me back to my own moments of trauma I hadn't thought of in a decade. 

There are others pointing out that this move is long winded, absurd or self-indulgent and lacking plot depth. That could be so, I didnt notice it. The cinematography, visual and auditory experience were, with out a doubt, on par with some of the best cinema I have ever seen from Nolan to Kubric.",c7y18a

Reading the script for the first time after seeing the movie, I notice there's a lot of great scenes that got cut (maybe for time?) that push more heavily on Dani being ""meant"" for the cult -- there's more scenes between her >!and Pelle. The missing scenes really add to the whole ""fairytale"" element, where it's like the missing royal is coming home to people who ""understand"" her. Also, there's a bit more context for Simon, Connie, and Ingemar that I totally did not see in the film. From Dani's perspective, Pelle is a considerate friend, but I love how you can also interpret him as manipulative or operating under his own motives -- there's some of it in the movie, but I really like his dialogue in the script that doesn't show up. It's a twisted sort of grooming that sort of reminds me of Pan's Labyrinth. It's easy to like him before you step back and take away the glasses Dani might be wearing when she interacts with him.!< I hope there's a director's cut!",c7y18a

et5apgr,"I just saw it. While it was tiring at times, I enjoyed it, more than Hereditary in fact. However, this is a peculiar movie, not one I'd recommend to fans who aren't either 'film buffs' interested by structure and composition, cause this one was decadent af, or fans of slow-burn or classic occult horror, to which Midsommar pays some love. It was another film about trauma, which makes sense coming from Hereditary, and some references and similarities to that one are telling. They knew they were in the shadow of that previous breakout hit, and Midsommar feels like an attempt to elaborate on the ideas while the iron is hot, and the money is there, without making the same film twice.

This is going to be a great companion to The Witch, and I'd even say the Suspiria remake. It's a new wave of witchy, less patriarchy-entrenched horror geared toward fans, enthusiasts, and opening weekend curiosity. Even when ballsy films like this don't work for me, I'm glad they're getting made-- and this one works for me, it's about trauma and loss and ritual, and the structure seriously makes me wonder if there isn't a hidden 'meta-sigil' at work, a la Grant Morrison's Invisibles, it's a film more concerned with its own composition and content than something more formulaic, though I would hardly call it surprising in any way.

I liked it a lot, but I don't have many folks I know I think would enjoy it as I did, and it does drag a bit, so replay is limited. Could def. end up being a classic, there's a respect for the project that I could see putting this on Jodorowsky's films' level, I suspect there's a lot more there, structurally more than content wise (but that too) that I missed my first way through.",c7y18a

C+. This movie could’ve been an hour shorter. The characters were completely stock and more like killable objects than people I cared about. The first 20 minutes were the most unsettling and complex and the movie really never revists the mental disorder of the sister or dives into the murders or backs up Dani’s clearly tumultuous history with said sister. I see a lot of people saying that the way the characters acted was unbelievable and slot of that is attributed to the drugs but the movie is so long that I had to constantly remind myself they were on drugs, I’ve never taken shrooms so either way I could relate to their actions. The entire thing was predictable, not because it followed a format akin to Hereditary and The Wickerman but because we’ve seen these characters before so we know what moves their gonna make, the cults and Pelles mildly veiled affection for Dani let’s us know exactly how that was gonna end, with her being queen, we knew the cult was actually crazy no shocker. The never re explored pelle lying about talking to Christian and Christians new found wonderment for the cult and their culture, it seems like he’s gonna be apart of the twist like he was working with Pelle or something but no. They barely react to anyone’s dissapearnce so I barely care. Dude obsessed with the culture follows dumb horror character trope and crosses a line so he is unsurprisingly killed. Such a slow build to climax that is less likes point and more like a plateau. Beautifully shot however, and the bathroom transition at the beginning was amazing.",c7y18a

My girlfriend was seriously upset by it and a little angry I'd taken her to see it.

Also cult stuff feels played out at this point. maybe I've seen too many horror movies but its just sooooo easy to do.",c7y18a
esnj24q,"I find the movie to be about two things, Grief and Empathy, and both subjects are intertwined.

Dani is experiencing severe grief, after losing her entire family in a really scarring manner. And no one is there for her. She obviously has no family to run to, and her boyfriend isn’t much of a help. In the beginning, he wants to break up with her, and only ends up not doing it cause 1) they’ve been together 4 years and it’s hard to leave something you’ve put so much time into and 2) more obviously because she just lost everything and leaving her would be the cunt-iest thing to do in the history of ever.

It’s also important to realize that we don’t really see her with any of her own friends. She’s talking to someone on the phone in the beginning, but considering that friend is never on screen, even when Dani is grieving, i doubt that relationship was important. Her BF’s friends, who she spends most of the movie with, actively dislike her, want him to breakup with her, and don’t want her to come on the trip.

Dani arrives at the village broken. She has no one. She regularly has panic attacks, and can’t sleep without medication. She’s not dealing with her grief. It’s just sitting there, it overflows at times. But it remains in her, boiling and festering. I think this parallels the pace of the film. A slow burn that overflows at times (examples: cliff scene / the black dude gettin shlapped). 

She is isolated, and we see in the movie, whenever someone is alone, they die. 

The people in Dani’s life lack empathy, and this is what the cult offers. No one feels for her, but when one member of the cult feels anything, they all feel it. The scenes where they mirror each other, when the girls scream with Dani, or when they all feel the pain of those burning at the end, demonstrate this. The cult offers the empathy that allows for Dani to no longer feel alone and to overcome her grief at the end.

I think Ari Aster is trying to tell us all two things. 
1. Don’t grieve alone. It doesn’t work and shit will just get worse as your life seemingly spirals out of control
2. Be empathetic. Be there for the people you care about, and feel what they are feeling. Go through what they are going through. Cry with them, and actually be there for them. Don’t do it out of some obligation, make sure it’s genuine

Then the tragedy happens and now there's no way out for him (at least for the foreseeable future).

etefrtd,"Weirdest Ikea commercial I've ever seen...

Ari Aster likes cults, naked people, extreme gore, grief, making you feel deeply deeply uncomfortable... and I'm all for it.

This movie has all that and some. It's a disorienting horror epic that slowly builds into chaos. Loved the world building and art direction in this film. So much attention to detail and creativity that really made the world in it feel alive. The filmmaking is incredible too. There's a lot of interesting shots and long takes that you aren't used to seeing and you can tell so much thought goes into blocking every shot in this movie. It all adds up to such a beautiful film to look at.

Great score in this movie that really added to the vibe. Also, the psychedelic elements to it were some of the best depictions of being on a hallucinogen i've ever seen; they really nailed what it's like to experience a bad trip.

Shout out to Florence Pugh, never heard of her before but she killed it. Aster has this uncanny ability of getting the perfect depictions of grief out of his actors. Pugh played it so well

While I loved this movie and I think it has some of the best scenes in a film I've seen all year, there's a couple things that bothered me. I think it was a little too long. There felt like a lot of filler and if it was just sped up a little bit, I think it would have been even better. There's also a rape scene in this movie that is played for laughs and it just felt distasteful. Saying that, the film is surprisingly more funny than I thought it'd be but I think even that could have been toned down just a little. Keep the bad times coming!

This movie is about the importance of family and feeling like you belong. We all are entitled to feel loved, to not be in a toxic relationship, and we'll go through anything to feel loved. We've become closed off, and while this village is obviously insane and way too extreme, there's something alluring about being apart of something with people that feels greater than yourself.

3) ANGER - Dani is upset about the nature of the trip and her having to go along with it. 

4) BARGAINING - Dani rationalizes the increasingly strange aspects of the cult and gives Christian too many chances.

5) DEPRESSION - Dani feels trapped by the cult as she learns its horrific nature.

6) TESTING - Dani finds good aspects of the cult and is able to realistically see Christian's relationship (his cheating)

7) ACCEPTANCE - Dani realizes she has to let Christian and her past life go and finds a new home in the cult (group mourning and pleasure at Christian's death)",c7y18a
esnoszc,"I saw the movie as satirizing the things we as humans accept or condone because they are done in the name of ""culture"" or ""tradition"". These things can be mostly benign such as ""pardoning the turkey"" practice or more insidious like Female Genital Mutilation. The movie portrays a spectrum of such things, starting off small and mostly ""haha isn't that cute"" to full on horrific.

I have never had a theatre laugh at a scene as much as at that ritual sex scene towards the end with Christian. Granted, I don't watch many comedies at theaters but that was like 60 seconds of straight up laughter during that scene.

I will say it doesn't quite surpass Hereditary for me. Hereditary became my #1 horror film of all time almost immediately, and I don't see it being unseated any time soon. Given that, I can't really fault Midsommar for having such a hard act to follow.

Besides, real question: is this even a horror movie? There's shocking and disturbing imagery, yes, and to a degree a sense of dread, but overall, the movie runs on surreal discomfort, not horror. This isn't a flaw, the movie feels very unique in this tone, but it feels like it's called horror for lack of a better term.

It could have been cut ten to twenty more minutes for an overall more cohesive experience.

That being said.... Wow. This isn't a horror movie. At least, I don't view it as such. I think it was a psychological.... Uh, trip? I wasn't scared at any scenes in particular except for the outhouse scene and the first trip where she visualizes the death of her sister and parent.

In fact, that double homicide murder was so absolutely terrifying, more than it had any right to be. It really set the tone for the rest of the movie. 

As for the cult I thought some things were overdone (the screaming with Dani at the end was a bit much) but I've never seen a movie that utilized color and lighting to create dread as well as this movie. So many horror movies are desaturated and focus on the darkness, having everything in plain sight was an amazing touch.

I'd say this is the ""horror"" movie to beat this year. If you're coming in without an open mind you're going to be so incredibly disappointed.

Some thoughts: **SPOILERS**

The flower effect with the hallucinagenics at the end was mesmerizing. I've never seen a movie get shroom trips so correctly before. 

The most disturbing image from the movie is Dani in her flower suit at the end. It was so strange and off-putting for something so beautiful to be so.... Eldritch in appearance? I can't explain it better than that.

The dude splayed open with his lungs still moving. FUCK.

Finall the acting of the lead. She is amazing. When she cries you are uncomfortable. So much.",c7y18a

esv4mf2,"It feels wrong describing Midsommar this way, but that was so much fun... I was so intrigued by the atmosphere the whole way through, which made the runtime feel appropriate. I felt myself peeking around corners, growing to know the confined lands of the community just as our American/English visitors were. Some ceremonies were explained, others were not, which made for such a perfect balance of understanding and confusion. I felt like we were figuring it out as if we were visiting there ourselves. This thing was so atmospheric, and the attention to detail was astounding. Idk, I really just click with this guy’s approach to filmmaking, and am so excited for his career.",c7y18a
esw0dt7,Is it crazy of me to think they deliberately excluded the brown/black people for breeding and purely used them as sacrifices becUse they have like a white purity thing going on? I mean they were all white despite having a tradition of bringing in outsiders to breed.,c7y18a

My summary this film- young Renee Zellweger, douchy Chris Pratt, Matthew Lillard and Chidi go to Sweden and trip so much they don't notice that there are 6 foreign guests, then 5, then 4, then 3 because... they are really dumb? I enjoyed the Susperia-style grotesque beauty thing, don't get me wrong, and it was interesting, but not fascinating  enough for me to rewatch to catch all the drawings and runes and clues.

et58bko,"Play spot the Hereditary reference: 

\- dolly shot in/out of a window

\- smash cut from day to night as a transition (on Josh's face) 

\- Naked cultists 

\- woman being comforted in an extremely ineffective manner by a guy who's completely out of his depth

\- Shot of someone going through grief/shock expressionless on a bed with resting-mourning face. 

\- Triangle shaped building and coronation for the climax. 

That said, I was very surprised by how conventional the movie ended up being. It's basically a slasher film, like if Alex Garland did Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Surprised by all the comedy too. I think general audiences and casual horror fans are actually gonna like this one more than Hereditary, because it's not as relentlessly depressing and you start getting slowly accustomed to the weird shit as soon as the cliff suicide happens, rather than like Hereditary where they just dunked your head in crazy at the end. Also the conventional plotting probably helps alot, too; Josh going into the sacred temple to take secret photos was hilarious at my screening cuz everyone just started nervously giggling at how stupid he was being. It was like being transported to a grindhouse screening for five minutes.",c7y18a
et87gdl,The thing that has been on my mind the most after watching this is why did that guy at the end lie to the man that volunteered to be sacrificed?

That guy had already volunteered so it seemed unnecessarily cruel to lie to him like that.,c7y18a
et9vy76,"Ive read reviews where a good majority of people are saying that they were disappointed due to this film being marketed as a horror movie, when in reality it was more of a unsettling drawn out suspense thriller? personally, I scared myself much more after thinking about the film hours after seeing it. what stuck with me was the scene where Dani is crying and screaming after she sees Christian participating in the sex ritual. The sisters of the commune follow her into that building and cry with her, scream with her, and mimic her behavior. this single act was the scariest part of the film, and I believe the breaking point for Dani, mentally. Her being named the ""queen"", and having control, is all an illusion. Some sort of sick idea being produced by a line of inbreeds. the reality is she is not the controller. she is the victim, a repeated theme throughout the entire film. this is a story about a victim of circumstances and her smile at the end is not meant to show happiness, but quite the opposite. The smile symbolizes her giving up, defeat if you will....scary

At the same time though, Pelle shows Dani pictures of the festival and the May Queen from “last year”. We see photographs of dozens of prior May Queens. Obviously people are going to turn 72 on a regular basis and require a ceremony. So does Midsommar happen every year and they’re lying about the 90 year thing?

euev5av,"I finally got to see it. And I absolutely loved it. It was like nonstop suspense. The foreshadowing felt a little obvious, but was well done regardless.

It’s such a difficult film to describe or box in. I was worried about it bc most comments I’ve read felt it was pointless. I was worried about the bloated 140 minutes.

But I never felt bored. I was constantly intrigued. Seeing the cult do their thing and live their life was interesting. I figured it would be some kind of sacrificial ritual. The psychedelics tripped me out, especially the pulsating flowers and faces in the mountains, but I felt the “guards up by normal cognition” conversation was related to it.

And boy the ending. I never thought I’d be happy for someone setting fire to their partner, but her smile at the end just brought something out in me. She was lost and she found her home, even tho she was tricked into an evil cult.

I like that the sacrifices were “chosen” by the Swedish members whose job it was to recruit. The tragedy at the beginning set up our “heroine”’s arc nicely, especially her anxiety attacks and",c7y18a
ev9yaeo,"Before I give my input I feel like I should clarify that I haven't seen the directors other works, nor do I typically seek out other media of this genre... Horror? Thriller?

To cut to the chase, I disliked the film. It was absolutely beautiful and I loved the way it contrasted the dark gory sacrifice with an overall colorful tone, however I feel like the movie fell short in almost every regard.

First and foremost, I believe tension wrought from 4 idiots not seeing whats going on, and a single person (Danni) getting ""weird vibes"" is a cheap troupe and this film deserves better.

Additionally, any semblance of plot comes from the focus on Danni and Christians relationship, and its eventual reversal at the end. Of which there was zero foreshadowing. It was simply traumatic event after traumatic event until Danni eventually caved. Even if I am supposed to believe that Danni would forsake Christian to the burning flames, in what world would she accept the sacrifice of the Josh and Mark, or more appropriately, the sacrifice of the only two people in this movie with any sense (the brits)

All in all, it feels like the film is intentionally vague, offers you a plot riddled with holes, and couples them with beautiful imagery and score in the hopes of the viewer doing all the mental heavy lifting.",c7y18a

Dani was portrayed as annoying as hell and weak at the beginning when she finagles her way onto the trip... but then when she gets there, she's the only one with any kind of chill? Felt it was contrived how the other Americans all did something to 'wrong' them and thus be sent to death, and that she unrealistically didn't get worked up the way the British couple did. Did she finally 'belong' amongst a community bonded by death?

Movie also dragged; the director never filmed one shot he wasn't in love with. I really didn't see the point in the long fifteen minute stretch at the beginning where she invites herself along; a cut from them discussing it at the party to her needy surprise, to the plane, would've easily sufficed. We didn't learn anything about the characters we didn't soon find out, other than Pelle was sweet on Dani, Mark was a dick, etc.",c7y18a
f9ocmnn,"I really liked the movie but I have some questions. I know I am going to seem really stupid but if someone could shed light/ their perspective I would appreciate it!!  It was hard for me to grasp some of the ideas. (also watched this movie after working a 9 hour shift on black friday, so that could have been part of it lol)  


 1) at the beginning when Dani's sister and parents died. It was obvious that she committed suicide but I couldn't figure out, did she kill her parents on purpose? I know it must be because she could have just stayed in the car and killed herself (although the fumes probably would have still killed her parents) but I don't understand this.   


2) was Dani's boyfriend under a spell from the beginning? The american couple was freaking out after the two old people jumped from the cliff, but he didn't seem to mind at all. Also why wouldn't they all as a group just leave at that point???? (I know one of them tried, but like common, why stay??)  


3) what is your opinion of why Christian wanted to write his thesis there? At first I thought ""Oh it is to get away from Dani and he is too much of a whimp to really break up with her."" But then I thought was it a spell/ curse the redhead put on him so he wants to stay?  


4) Finally (obviously this is up to you) what do you think happens to Dani?",c7y18a
hmmglvy,"Honestly I found Dani annoying. I understand that she is going through depression and grief after her family dying but we don't really see her ""caring"" or being ""close"" to her family to be really heartbrokened.

esn2d11,"Don’t really know what to think honestly but Florence Pugh is great and I gasped with my hand to my mouth when they hit the guys face in with a mallet, good god! Hard to shock me but that was brutal and same with the other person dropping and seeing the skin fall off the face",c7y18a
esn6w5v,"I really liked it. I saw Hereditary just a few months ago, love it, so of course I've been eagerly awaiting this. 

I felt like it gave just enough, without over-telling. We knew Josh was uncomfortable with the first day's festivities, but like the characters, it was ""best"" we witnessed it rather than have it explained. 

I also have no idea the significance of the oracle and his drawings/predictions, the meaning of the runes/drawings on the walls, and more that I am still trying to digest. I like that they weren't all explained. It felt organic in the sense that the themes and motives and everything aren't there for us, the outsiders. Only those embedded in the culture know what everything means, pushing them just a little beyond the scope of being characters for a movie, in my mind.

But then again, I am just a simple movie-goer who likes to get as immersed as possible into the story. And the film did that for me astoundingly with its visuals. The subtle warps of the surrounding area while they were high, and that breathing flower thing that honestly made me uncomfortable, they did a great job at dragging me into that mindset, without being too over the top. 

I was unfortunately dragged out of it at the end, where Dani had to choose who would be sacrificed, and the brief moment of silence we were allowed... dude in the audience let a massive one rip. It was awful. Thankfully he was on the opposite side of the theater, but still. 

This is a bit rambled, as I don't ever write in these discussion threads, but I felt I should for this one. Great film, visually stunning, chilling, and left me wanting more (in a good way).",c7y18a
esn7cmn,"I liked it a lot, however I did not love it. The story was not as tight and enthralling as Hereditary imo, most of what happened was what i expected given each character's established personality. This reminded me very much of the cannibal movie genre where young adults go on a trip to an unknown foreign place (usually the amazon in cannibal films, Sweden here). Slowly get picked off when the remote community they stumble upon is more hostile than they thought. I recognize someone lead them there in this situation, but it reminds me of the trope where rich people make friends with poor people, invite them to a party, only to be revealed as a sabotage to make fun of them, just turned up to 11. This plot point felt very obvious from the conversation on the apartment couch. I won't bother with any comparisons to Wicker Man, that movie is old enough to be an influence without being intrusive, as Don't Look Now was with Hereditary.

If this movie wasn't made by Ari Aster I would be offended at how much is borrowed from Hereditary. Just to name a few: flat shot of a man consoling a sobbing woman after loss, head gore, imagery of a cult and their symbols, naked old cult members, The cults goal of fulfilling a spot of royalty(king and queen), the final ceremony in a small wooden room.

Even with all of that, the movie enthralled me for most of the runtime. It felt it's length but my eyes were glued to the screen and I was buying it the entire time. The gore was *chef kiss* incredible. The subtle psychedelic effects are great as well. The opening credit sequence was very nice too. Everything about what you're seeing is beautiful and horrific and real. From a production standpoint, you'll be hard pressed to find any horror movies on this caliber, there aren't many movies in general this nice to look at. I'm very excited to see where Aster goes from here, especially after hearing he wants to move away from horror. His weirdness would be welcome in any genre, similar to how I view Lanthomos.

It was effective and unique in the grand scheme of things, just felt too similar coming directly after Hereditary. Regardless, it's a ride and I'm gonna see it again tomorrow to try and pick up on some of the easter eggs throughout (noticed the painting of the bear on fire, the tapestry foreshadowing the pube pie, and Pele's parents ""dying in a fire"")

Other than that though, it's 2.5 hours of incredibly compelling and adventurous filmmaking. The atmosphere, cinematography, music/sound design, all incredible.

I assume the end burning triangle represents the symbol being completed finally. Additionally, when some of them were discussing the babies and how the village raised the children together, that women suggested that the baby’s mother was elsewhere (not at the commune). I assumed she was out scouting for more sacrifices to bring in as Pelle did. Maybe from a certain age they are expected to leave the commune and look for new sacrifices while leaving behind whatever children they bear during those earlier years.

So in the beginning the movie made me feel really uncomfortable with the death of Danis parents and her sister, but after that it felt like the movie was slipping into atmosphere only and leaving the story behind.

My theory (yeah I know it's lame) is that the whole experience in Sweden is a bad shroom trip of Danis, because the rituals had similarities to her life/situation and the villagers kept on doing that inhaling pain sound like she did when she had her breakdowns.

PS: I read some reactions to the movie on reddit and it annoys me a lot, that some of you say it took place in Switzerland. It took place in **Sweden**. Those countries are far apart from each other. I just felt the need to clarify that.

f20irkc,"A lot of people saying this is not a scary movie and I agree, but it is not a flaw and is obviously a choice from the director. Ari Aster had a lot of moments that he could insert a scary sequence, but he chose to leave it offscreen to evoke a diferent feeling to the viewer from scary. For example the murder suicide, or the first three killed by the cult. No scary sequence, just a gentle ""Oh, he went away with the truck"" and later ""Follow me, I will show you"" instead of a 1, 2 minute sequence with tension until they get killed.",c7y18a
f35osf0,"I liked this movie. I didn’t go in to it looking for Hereditary 2 or symbolism or anything like that which seems to be a handful of the complaints about it. At face value I think it was good. I didn’t particularly care about all of the characters but I found them all entertaining enough. I liked the portrayal of the drugs, I think it’s the only movie I’ve seen that’s actually done a decent job with it. (Although it’s been quite a few years since I’ve done drugs so maybe I don’t remember all that perfectly lol) I don’t know why everyone’s so pissed off Dani killed Christian (Kristen?) at the end, she’s been building up resentment towards him, just saw him fucking some girl, and was high as balls, it’s not like she was logically thinking what the right thing to do was, she was tripping and hating him.  Sure we didn’t have answers for everything but it’s a freaky cult, what are they gonna do, explain their hundred + year culture the whole time to some kids who they’re killing and don’t even speak their language? It makes sense that they just get on to business as usual.


Don’t get me wrong I’m not giving this movie a 10/10 but I at least was interested until the very end and wouldn’t be surprised if I’m thinking about this movie at some point for the next couple of days and I’d say that qualifies it as a good movie in my book.",c7y18a

But after they got to the village, the film kind of flopped in my opinion. It was obvious that something fucked up was going to happen, and we just had to wait one and a half hours to see it. It also borrowed quite a lot of elements from Hereditary (gory ""shock scene"" in the middle of the movie for example).",c7y18a

Totally psychedelic, funny, fun, disturbing etc. I've been reading some takes on the movie and I have to say I'm super surprised by the opinion many had that Christian is a shitty boyfriend, like [here](https://www.theringer.com/movies/2019/7/8/20685969/midsommar-exit-survey). To me, the movie did an excellent job showing that Christian was roped into a deeper relationship than he wanted; he's considering breaking up with her when he gets the call that her family is dead. I think many many people in that situation would succumb to guilt and not have the heart to break up with their significant other. Even if he's a bit of a dud, he still invites her to come and offers to wait to take shrooms with her.

I read the script and it’s very explicit that she’s smiling because she’s completely snapped and gone insane, but the person I saw it with read it more as her finally getting some catharsis and resolution via the cult hive mind/group empathy.  Obviously my reading on it was influenced by reading the script ahead of time but I’m just not seeing where my friend was coming from.",c7y18a
esqcpxy,"I read the script for this ages ago, and I've been waiting for the film to come out to discuss it with people.

Ari keeps proving that he is an amazing visual director. He has a talent for imagery, sound, milking a moment. His films make me feel uncomfortable, and that's a feat. 

However, I think this story shows that he also needs some constraint. There's a lot I love about it - but it felt very one-note to me, which was a bigger issue than I thought it would be thanks to its length. I didn't really feel like there was any structure to it, and although several individual scenes blew me away, they came across as disparate rather than intertwined pieces to a larger whole. I also appreciated the feeling of dread throughout; but I never believed for a moment that these educated characters would stick around after the first death sequence. Ari seems to write from theme rather than plot, and it makes his cast hard to connect with. 

This said, the film is still definitely a work of art. Reading through the thread, I'm thrilled that people love it.",c7y18a
esqvymp,"This movie isn’t even scary as much as it is upsetting and plain bizarre.

 Hereditary was set up in such a way where everything was a mystery and the tension made you scared of the unknown. 

 Ari just flipped the script this time around and took his sweet time establishing the world and culture and customs of this all to calm cultish society before delivering perfectly on everything he built.

The term “horror” gets thrown around so loosely these days when it comes to movies that are really only there to give you a couple jumps. 

This movie though, actually, truly, raw and horrifying. I’ve never been so shocked in my life by a film.",c7y18a

et7snch,"I didn't like this one quite as much as Hereditary, but I think it's still a great movie and a worthy followup. I also think it's worth celebrating how quickly this movie came together.  Hereditary went wide 13 months before Midsommar. If we look at the other arty horror breakouts from the last few years Jordan Peele took 25 months to follow up Get Out, Robert Eggers is at 40 months since The Witch, David Robert Mitchell took over 4 years to follow up It Follows, Jennifer Kent is over 5 years since The Babadook. I know some of that is due to festival releases and I don't say this to hold it against the other directors, but in praise of Aster's ability to work inside the Hollywood framework and release two great movies in just over a year.

What I liked: Ari Aster might be the best director I'm familiar with at creating disturbing images that my mind won't let go of. I want to avoid any Hereditary spoilers but if you've seen it you know what I'm referring to, and in this it was the image of Dani's sister with the hose taped to her mouth. This will sound weird, but the visceral action/horror movie fan in me likes it when a face gets smashed into mush, and this movie had multiple instances of that.  Florence Pugh was great in this, I've only ever seen her in Fighting With My Family, which I wasn't a huge fan of, but this was good enough that I'll see whatever she's in next.  I also really liked William Jackson Harper in this. It was a little weird to see him as a PhD student after seeing him as a professor in The Good Place, but he felt like some people I knew in grad school. The movie is also absolutely beautiful. I'm sure there's a ton of visual detail hidden in there that I missed and I'm excited for a second viewing. And finally the movie is really funny at times, but for me it doesn't slip over that line where it detracts from the tone.

What I didn't like: I thought it was a little too predictable at times.  For example when it showed the mural of the ""love story"", was there any doubt that we would see it happen? Or did you ever doubt that Dani would be the May Queen from the first second it was mentioned? I'm also a little over cults.  I've read in here that Aster has said he wants to move away from horror, but if he does return to horror at some point I hope he stays away from stories about cults. And finally, I can't totally separate the writing from the performance but I wasn't crazy about Christian as a character. He's written as such an asshole that I didn't really care what happened to him. Mark was the same way, but Will Poulter is a charismatic enough actor that I didn't want to lose him, where I don't think Jack Reynor was capable of that.

Weird spot to ask, but in Dani's apartment she has a poster that I think has a bunch of dinosaurs on it. If I remember correctly you can see it in the scene where she talks with Christian about going to Sweden. Does anybody know where I could find that or was it an original piece for the movie?

Overall this is a 4/5 for me. I'm pumped to see what the future has in store for Ari Aster.  If this really is his last horror movie then I'm glad he's given us two great horror films, and I'm excited to see his take on action or sci-fi or wherever he goes next. This is probably my favorite horror film of the year so far, it would be competing with Us but I think I'd have this ahead right now.",c7y18a
etkdy3j,"I just got out, wow. It feels like I was tripping? Like, I’m also not entirely sure where I am.

I was tranced and like the group, slowly and more slowly realized what was going on around me. While there were funny parts, I don’t understand how my theatre group laughed during the mating ritual and subsequent joint screaming.

ett0lh8,"This thread is super long already but I just wanted to throw in my take. Spoilers below. 

&#x200B;

I loved this. I found myself in awe the entire time and how weird and tense and at-times predictable the film was. I expected this to have more jump scares and shocking moments, but over all it was such a slow burn. It really took time to play out it's metaphor (mourning and grief). While watching - I felt like the film really showcased the 5 stages of grief (not only for Dani & her family but also Dani & her relationship with Christian & her general self-worth). 

&#x200B;

**Denial**

* Dani is in disbelief at the tragedy that's occurred with her family, and she's in denial that the only relationship she has left is falling apart - she goes to parties and tries her best to act ""normal"" but her jealousy and resentment towards Christian continues to brew. She decides to pretend things are fine and take a trip with him. They have shockingly been dating for four years and it's clearly not working but they're unable to end things.

**Anger**

* She begins to recognize her frustrations with him - Christian forgets her birthday, he isn't concerned about Connie & Simon's whereabouts, he's a dick to Josh. She has dreams he abandons her & generally doesn't seem happy to be there. 

**Bargaining**

* Dani continues to make exceptions for Christian - she forgives him for forgetting her birthday. She sees that there are odd things happening around her but she makes excuses for them, thinking that Mark is off with some girl and Josh is doing research. She thinks if she can just make it through this experience with Christian then things will be fine. The nightmares she has of her family show that she hasn't gotten over that yet, and is trying to cope with the fact that her family is gone. I think the elder suicide is a catharsis point for her - as someone else mentioned here - that she sees that and thinks that maybe what her sister did could be in some way justified. 

**Depression**

* Things escalate and Dani becomes the May Queen. She puts new life into the Earth with her harvest ritual but then is immediately confronted with Christian's cheating. This leads to one of the most profound moments in the movie (for me) when the women are moaning and screaming with Dani in solidarity. It's alarming, but Dani is face to face with her grief and she is being fully seen and recognized. 

**Acceptance** 

* Dani realizes that she has found a place where she feels connected to others, she realizes that to move forward she must let go of Christian, and she accepts her situation and takes action to finding a better way to live. 

&#x200B;

Maybe I'm reading too much into this... haha. I ended up being happy that she was able to come face to face with her grief and loss and make a choice to move forward (even if it was burning your shitty BF alive). Separately.... why does Dani have no friends other than her shitty BF...",c7y18a
eu79cl1," * The cult in ""Midsommar"" orbits around the supernatural, but there are no overtly supernatural events in the way that ""Hereditary"" left no doubt that unseen evil was present.

* I was sure that when Christian bit into the ""hair pie"" he was going to  pull out a human finger bone or something. Just as the drinks were strange and vague, I got a subtle sense of cannibalistic undertones regarding the mystery meat at the meals. Ritual consumption of human beings would be right in line with violent pagan practices.",c7y18a
f2mli22,"I really like this movie. Watched it twice, back to back- theatrical release and director's cut. To me, it's a movie about empathy, loss, and finding a real support network (a family). Dani's reactions to anxiety and panic attacks are extremely horror themed, especially if you do have a panic disorder it's very relatable.  


I really enjoyed the segment in which the elderly members killed themselves. Everyone relates to sudden human violent death differently. Dani's building anxiety attack turning into detachment was a realistic depiction of one way our brains process and deal with that sort of thing. No one can really be prepared for that, in which I'm referring to Josh who had done his research and was upset despite knowing.  


This movie hit me emotionally several times. Dani having a breakdown over seeing Chris ""cheating"" on her, and the female members sharing in her pain; Dani isn't alone as she's felt so deeply throughout the film.  


Also to agree with another member who mentioned this.. Dani x Pelle OTP",c7y18a
f3m89qk,I loved Hereditary (after a second viewing) but the only way I could finish this movie was by fiddiling with my phone while watching it.,c7y18a
esn9lai,"I loved it. Even more than Hereditary. Everyone was so good is except for the boyfriend. That camera shot where the camera goes above the car, then in front and Upside was nuts. This movie seemed to perfectly show stuff I’ve always wanted to see in a movie.

That being said, this was easily the worst audience I’ve ever been apart of. The dude sitting next to me was exclaiming literally every minute. Also, I get that some parts were intentionally funny, but why do people just start laughing when they see something weird they don’t understand? My audience was laughing just at naked fat people. How were they old enough to buy a ticket?! I can’t imagine them watching the opening credits to Nocturnal Animals.",c7y18a
eso4dhv,"After a night of thinking it over, I think the moral complexity of the Hargars has emerged as one of my favorite parts of the movie.

The Paimon cult from “Hereditary” destroys Annie’s family solely for its gain, resulting in an ending that plays out with triumphant music and visuals despite the undeniable undercurrent of evil. You feel real pain seeing that helpless family so meticulously undone.

The Hargars, meanwhile, are a bit more complex. Their radical empathy and familial nature rescue Dani, giving her a community that accepts and nurtures her. The violent ending ritual plays out with similarly triumphant visuals and music, but the feeling is much more uplifting. 

Yet the Hargars also brutally kill Dani’s travel companions and drug Christian to “let down his defenses” so that he’ll have sex with a cult member (this can easily be construed as rape). Dani pushes through a half-hearted objection so that she can see the latter act, which causes her final breakdown and ultimate acceptance of the cult as her new family. By listening to Pelle’s foreshadowing throughout the movie, you understand that this was the cult’s plan the whole time.

So while I merely felt grief and sadness for the destruction of the Graham family unit in “Hereditary,” I feel much more conflicted by “Midsommar.” Should I be happy Dani is happy? Do the means justify those ends? Or should I be more concerned that Dani has bought into a murderous cult, accepting it as her new family? Is she really happy or was she merely brainwashed/broken down?

Plenty to chew on with this flick. I loved it.

EDIT: rearranged some words",c7y18a
esuuk5s,"There isn’t a movie/TV/media creator alive that films and scripts panic attack’s, mental health deterioration, grief, and relationship deterioration better than Ari Aster.

There were all these articles about how it’s one of the most disturbing movies you’re ever going to see and you won’t sleep after seeing it, and I definitely felt the tension and anxiety in the first half, but I felt that the movie didn’t deliver in the second half at all. My girlfriend and I were expecting to be highly disturbed and on the shocked (like hereditary) but we were mostly laughing towards the end. Maybe we’re just the kind of people who aren’t put off by the imagery in the film. I felt as though the first half really set up a lot to happen, I was disturbed by the families death and was compelled by the dynamic between Dani and Christian and all his friends and the soundtrack and cinematography really built up a great sense of dread. But even upon discovering what becomes of everyone, I couldn’t help but feel underwhelmed. We genuinely felt like scenes were missing with the overall lack of follow through from the set up. Is this just me? A lot of people are really hyping this movie up, but I’d only give it a 6/10.",c7y18a

eucwkst,"Just got back from seeing it. Boy I don’t know if I’m dumb or something but this movie did not speak to me on any level. Sure there were some grotesque and horrific imagery but outside of that, I didn’t care for any of the characters or what the overall plot might have been. Dani doesn’t have an arc in my mind. She talks about she is dependent on Christian at the start and then is dependent on the cult at the end. She doesn’t ever have a moment where she thinks for herself. She just exists to be manipulated. 

The folks that died, they didn’t deserve any of that. I’ve seen some people claim that they were evil but I don’t think that could be any further from the truth. They were normal people with normal ambitions and curiosity. The cult was the evil people here. They’ve invited these people under incredibly false pretenses. 

I’ve yet to see Hereditary but if it’s like this, might skip it as it may seem I’m not the right audience for their movies. 

Also, this has the worst sex scene I’ve seen in quite some time, maybe ever. My audience was laughing at this scene. It might have been due to the audience seeming to feel like I did, just didn’t like it. I can see why it has a C+ Cinescore.",c7y18a
f1e1zon,"I just finished watching this movie right now. I’m totally blown away. A horror movie that is set 95% in a brightly lit environment managed to more disturbing and psychological shocking than most movies shot in a dark atmosphere.

The symbolisms or blind faith, finding comfort in lies and being so brainwashed you‘d give away everything you hold dear and everything you are because you’re so blinded by it, even when this faith is quite obviously a lie built on taking plants with psychological effects and the use of continuous dance routines and specific food types, arranged “matings” and obedience to elders is a typical trait of oppressive cults and regimes.

Also, I think aside from tackling blind faith and avoiding to face your pain and running into the arms of faith even when it’s a lie, the movie seems to reflect on emotionally draining relationships and the contagious effects of sorrow. The movie hints at Dani being often too leaning on Christian and his friends tell him that she’s overdoing it and that he’s been trying to get away from this relationship for a year or so, and I believe after the death of her family, she just refused to come to terms with her loss and her sorrow and detachment from reality and ongoing moments of pain somehow leeched onto Christian that led him into a cycle of depression and suffering.

I might be reaching here but I felt like the beginning of the movie implied that meaning in some way. I’m not saying leaning on your partner for emotional support is wrong, but sadness and pain can be contagious at times and someone’s grief can somehow find a way to “infect” someone else that instead of them helping those in pain, they end up drowning in sorrow with them.

I also feel like the “mating ceremony” and how Christian was literally drugged and enthralled into it somehow and the moments before the dinner where he was following her May Queen celebration. It felt like he was trying to reach out to her, he was following her as she went in and out of her depressive and possibly psychotic episodes (all caused by her immense loss) and how every time he tried to know what was going on, no one gave him an answer until he was lured away to someone else’s arms (at the start of the film, it was stated that she hasn’t had sex with him for a long time) so he ended up in a non-emotional affair with someone not because he wanted to cheat but because her extreme situation pushed him away and how soon he realized what he’d done and abhorred himself for it. It was as if he had zero control.

Eventually Dani discovered his infidelity and she punished him for it (realistically or metaphorically) and his grief killed him in the end, while she smiled as she was fully consumed by this newfound faith that she can no longer feel the grave damage around her.",c7y18a
f2g7tfd,"My God Christian and Josh's reactions to seeing the old couple die in spectacularly graphic fashion took me completely out of this movie since nobody who sees something that horrific would just see it has ""it's just something that's appart of their culture so we gotta respect it"". It doesn't help that the British couple reacted what any reasonable human being would in that situation. The film is filled with moments like that which made for a frustrating watch. 6.9/10 meh",c7y18a
esn0n65,"Did not leave the theatre with the same feeling as hereditary. I feel like you have to go in with a lot of knowledge of Pagan lore/speak Swedish to really get a grasp of what happened. The movie was shot very well, and I was very entertained throughout. A lot of very nice foreshadowing and such. When Pele(?) said his parents died in a fire; we see what he means at the end. 

Why did they put the black guy’s foot (Josh?) in the garden? What’s the metaphor for that, and ideas? And what was the meaning to how they decorated the other corpses. Did I see correctly that the guy with the eyebrows was dressed like a jester?

I also liked the irony of the character being named ""Christian"" in a Pagan community.

There was one thing that kind of ruined immersion for me though. When they first land in Sweden, you see some shots of what's supposed to be Stockholm, but it's clearly Budapest. We instantly looked at each other with my girlfriend, eyebrows raised. I mean I knew they shot the movie in Hungary, but come on...

Then they travel to the countryside and it's so Hungary. I am from Hungary and I've spent a couple of months in Sweden as a student. For me the whole thing just felt off. The roads, the vegetation, the landscapes. It felt nothing like Sweden.

I don't know, maybe it's not a big deal, I just thought it's worth mentioning. It's like the Hårga culture didn't match the environment, if that makes any sense.

esvxivg,I'm not entirely sure why people liked this movie so much. The cinematography was good and they absolutely nailed the visuals when people are hallucinating but other then that I was just bored throughout the movie. I feel like I would have enjoyed this movie more if they actually showed some of the gruesome things that happened to the characters rather then just showing the aftermath. Like that cliff scene was good because you got to see how everything happened. Imagine if they just cut away from the people on top of the cliff and the next time you see them was on the fire with their faces caved in (thats how I felt when I saw the guy with his back cut open). I thought it was strange that no one really questioned the disappearance of their friends and just took everything the cult said at face value. I'm also not sure why they cut to the inbred kid so much. He had a few scenes in the movie but he didn't really matter much to the plot? Unless I'm missing something it just seemed like he was there to add shock value (for his looks and for the cult to be revealed as partaking in incest).,c7y18a
et4wjgt,"The guy that played Christian (Jack Reynor) kept reminding me of some cross between Seth Rogan and Chris Pratt. His arc is so weird though, it's interesting how he goes from the head of the table (also a dick the way he dismissed dani's problems and then backhanded invite to the trip) with his friends to arbitrarily picking a thesis (I thought that might have been some 4-d chess five steps ahead move of brilliance where he had some sort of plan in mind but I guess not) to sort of accepting the situation of having been fed vagina hair and then later knowingly drinking the happy time tea and then ultimately being left unable to move or speak sitting in a bear suit and burnt alive. I love the visual exchange of him and her when she's deciding to sacrifice him as well as the moment where before the sex ritual begins when she asked if he could come with her on the wagon ride to restore the crops, and they are like 'no'. 

&#x200B;

The dialogue wasn't working for me at least in how inorganic it felt, like they'd be sitting at a table with three dozen silent weirdos and just never acknowledge the absurdity of any given moment, a huge lack of awareness or scrutiny, and yeah the characters have to be susceptible morons for things to happen but damn. 

&#x200B;

Josh was the smartest dumbest smart dumb character who left his peter tingle behind on the trip. How was studying this stuff and couldn't piece together the imminent sacrifices, or he knew of some of it right since he knew the cliff jumping thing was coming but still he didn't have the sense to not fuck with these nutbars (and I guess the others in germany and wherever else, keep this culty cinematic universe expanding baby!). 

&#x200B;

The first part had a few great mirror shots that reminded me of Contact, and then some great transitions at times like the fwip into the airplane bathroom. Some hokey shots like the eye-lids closing and opening for Christian. Some details to look out for on subsequent viewings like all the art in the apartment being reminiscent of the rituals to come as if Dani was being primed for this thing long before. 

&#x200B;

I was hoping there would be something crazier coming at the end, like a bear attack or a summoning of something. I did like when the london couple asked about the bear and the dude was just like 'it's a bear  in a cage, no big deal, let's move on, pay no attention to the creepy blanket which depicts the coming sex ritual'. 

&#x200B;

The soundtrack didn't make much of an impression on me, it wasn't bad or detracting, though I read how it was the dude from Haxan Cloak and recall the album Excavation being pretty unsettling at times, though nothing here ever got under my skin or freaked me out. There were some good moments of heightened tension before a cut to something else, though it seemed like a lot of it was subdued.

Florence Pugh as Dani was great and nailed the turmoil of the character as well as the glorious look when she ascended to become the lizard king in her flower mound outfit. Though between her being a mess most of the time and Christian internalizing so much, there was little to latch onto in terms of a main character here, which I can see working for this and being the point, though also I just would have liked more interaction and verbalization of some things despite still being ok with the end result here. I don't think it was as 'good' as Hereditary, yet I don't feel it's worse in any sense, it's just different and feels a bit aimless at times. Hereditary had the miniature motif that came off a lot stronger to me in terms of what it brought to the table as both a visual framing thing as well as a larger metaphor. Here in Midsommar you have them do mushrooms or drink tea, and nothing that interesting comes of it, the flower on Dani's head piece pulsates and some other things wiggle, and maybe there was a scary face in the trees, it didn't play as strongly to me.",c7y18a
et82nwe,Show this movie to all those girls who bring horoscopes into everything,c7y18a
etbio98,"The guttural sounds that come from Florence Pugh's mouth are gut-wrenching; what a way to start a film. I liked how the movie starts very dark and still, it serves as a nice contrast to the lush scenery that comes later/throughout the rest of the film. I read the screenplay before seeing the movie (I personally love to spoil things for myself so that I can really get into the lore of the story), and I wish they had kept the part where Christian yells at his friends, ""Her whole family is DEAD."" It would have been nice to see some sort of compassion sent Dani's way, although this lack of empathy sets up the end of the film nicely because I personally didn't feel too sad about any of the character's death's, except maybe Mark's simply because he was nice comic relief (despite being a douchebag), and he kept my group laughing through the film. Will Poulter is great. After they are initially greeted by one of the head elders in Sweden and Mark says, ""That guy has a really red face,"" I was cracking up. 

Christian is a shitty boyfriend...I came out of the movie not feeling much sympathy for him, and I was so glad to finally see Dani receive some happiness by the end, even if it was under the most fucked up circumstances. Those scenes at the beginning where Christian gives a half-ass ""apology"" and then threatens to leave once Dani asks to talk about it reminded me of my own first toxic relationship and the frustration that comes with it. I have been in Dani's shoes and know what it's like to stay in an unhealthy relationship simply because you're not sure who else to turn to. 

The head trauma scenes had me verbally going, ""OOOOOOH."" We had a small crowd in my showing, but that scene and those jump cuts are really where people started to go silent and pay attention. Ari really loves his head explosions. However, I honestly didn't think the commune was too bad or evil. I didn't like that they lied about some stuff (the Simon/Connie fiasco), and obviously some of the murders were technically unjustified, but other than that, I think they were just people living their own customs. In some scenes, I even found myself thinking, ""That looks like fun, actually."" The Maypole/May Queen scene had me wishing that I could be a May Queen.....the use of flowers and floral design was breathtaking. The close-up shot of Dani's face inside her flower suit was mesmerizing, and I've been trying to find a Google image of it because it's so beautiful lol.

Many people have said this, but the tripping scenes are great and so realistic. I loved looking in the background for things that were out of the ordinary. I also liked Pelle as a character, and honestly, if Dani and Pelle hypothetically end up together post-credits and live the rest of their lives in the commune, I think that's a happy ending. Total rebirth for our protagonist who has been through so much. Maybe that makes me a bit crazy, but it's a movie and NOT real life, so who cares? In the world of the story, I think it's lovely. 

Overall, beautifully shot and a great artistic film. If you're looking for a jump-scare slasher, this may not be the movie for you. But if you like artsy shit and movies that make you think looong after you leave the theater, this is a good one for ya'. I personally preferred it to ""Hereditary,"" because to me, ""Hereditary"" was all dark, but ""Midsommar"" shares some light (literally and metaphorically). I will say that although the two movies are obviously very different, the end scene of ""Midsommar"" (think burning corpses with tree branches coming out of bodily orifices) reminded me a lot of the end scene of ""Hereditary"" where the Paimon ritual is taking place in the clubhouse/Charlie's bedroom. I would see ""Midsommar"" again and again lol.",c7y18a

esoufee,"I loved the location, tone, cinematography - but because the filmmakers are so talented, I was also disappointed in how 'random' everything felt, one-note characters, lack of 'reason' or logic behind many of the key moments. They seemed more interested in coming up with freaky ideas and using 'this is a weird cult' as the excuse for everything, but never really explaining/justifying what the cult believes in or why they do what they do. Few examples, the incest child, wearing skin masks, planting a leg in the ground, the strung up guy with lungs outside the body, the ritual sex scene, the pubes/blood in food, the bear, certain sacrifices at the end - it was all just random odd shit that never connected. Shocking as viewers, maybe in the perspective of the American guests, but in the end it didn't really satisfy. Even though I appreciate a slower pace at least 30 minutes could have been cut. Overall it still felt unique, had more weight than a generic horror with dumb characters, but expected a stronger script after Hereditary.",c7y18a
esqxpom,"This movie made me feel so disturbed and uneasy, I really liked it. I love Ari Aster's style of avoiding jumpscares and instead using imagery, sound, and foreshadowing to create a sense of dread. It will probably polarize people who aren't familiar with his style though. I heard one guy say it was ""fucking retarded"" after it ended. I will admit that I liked Hereditary a bit more since Midsommer felt more muddled and confusing at times. Still, if you liked Hereditary, you should definitely see this too. Also Mark was a dick. Funny, but still a dick.

At the end, when Dani smiles as Christian burns, is she actually happy or is she being influenced by the cult and she's finally lost it? Also why do the cult members often mimic how others feel?",c7y18a

But, upon thinking about it, I think the predictability of the move was built in. Obviously we are going to be getting some human sacrifices. It was just a matter of ""how"" we get there. The main focus was her journey through grief to acceptance, and that's where the movie ended. It's beautifully shot, music is great. I wouldn't mind seeing it again (as disturbing as it was) just to see it from another perspective.",c7y18a
esvcdre,"Three things I noticed on a second viewing:

1) when she blows out the candle on her cake she does the same breathing thing the rest of them do throughout the movie

2) her dream is the only time except for the beginning that we see it being night time

3) after she is crowned Queen and all of the imagery is moving and ""breathing"", it stops after she is separated from Christian (she even asks if he can come and she is told no)

I'm not really sure what to make of these, if anything, just interesting things that caught my attention",c7y18a
et10247,"So, my questions/thoughts about it:

- What was the point of the villagers being upset about the stolen book? Was it just their excuse as to why Mark and Josh were missing?

- I'm assuming that when Dani makes eye contact with the old woman before she jumps off the cliff, there's some exchange of energy there. Maybe it was passing on the ""ability"" to become May Queen, which explains how Dani gains the ability to speak Swedish and do the dance without issue.

- Did Pelle know the entire time that Dani was destined to be the May Queen? Is that why he had no issue about her coming? If not, would they have let Dani live?

- Those meat pies obviously had human meat, right? And the meat at the table during the dinner after Dani is crowned was also human?

- Worth noting: Pelle saying the festival happens every 90 years was a lie, since there's multiple photographs of past May Queens, and Pelle saying his parents died in a fire (probably in a previous ritual). Why lie?",c7y18a
et4xetx,"4 days after watching this movie, I am still not  sure how I feel about this movie.

Hereditary is one of my FAVORITE movies, and it's better due to exploration of the Myth of Demon, Paimon. Myth is cool AF!

But here with Midsommar, it just NEVER really explored the Myth. So, without going deep on the Myth, majority of people liked it for totally other reasons that doesn't have to do with 'Demons or Evil spirits' but I DO think that they are influencing the cult although the link seems almost not exist due to the major subtlety!

That's what's missing for me personally to really LOVE this movie. I still liked it, but definitely not as much as Hereditary. 

Looking at where this movie has any major twists I didn't get anything would blow me away, NOT really so far either.

It's going to be preferable for some people that the Myth is lacking, story is less supernatural, but not for me. We all have our own preferences!",c7y18a
et8mhdq,"I feel like all the characters died within 10 minutes of each other

Between Simon and Josh, I swear no more than 10 minutes passed, and everyone was already dead except Dani and Christian

It kinda took the tension out of the movie for me",c7y18a
et8q013,"I gave myself a day to see if I'd like it more after I thought on it more but the opposite has happened. 

The story was extremely predictable and there was virtually no plot after Josh gets bonked. After that point it was obvious what eventually was going to happen and it took forever because of all the slow panning and close ups they felt the need to cram in. Felt like they continued with ""hey audience maybe something weird is actually happening and things aren't as normal as the Swedish people make it seem hmmm??"" even into the like last 30 minutes. 

I know people will tell me to look deeper into how it's a story of ""rebirth"" and being accepted and so forth, and I see what they see there, but the plot still has to be somewhat present to me. It doesn't feel to me like any kind of acceptance story when Dani and Christian were drugged the whole time, the cult clearly manipulated them to get what they wanted, and the group's ""mirroring"" of her emotions was just a sort of tradition/custom that they'd do not matter what. Felt way more like a story about a woman in a terrible emotional state being taken advantage of.

Not all bad of course, cinematography was solid especially in the beginning when the movie wasn't lasting too long and man Dani's actress is phenomenal. Also they did well writing Christian as a realistic selfish jackass, not just the ""jerk"" character like Mark.",c7y18a
et8r2d9,"Let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of Hereditary. Everything from the amazing performances, the camera work, and the story; it was a masterpiece in my mind. 



Midsommar was my 3rd most anticipated movie, and man it was the biggest disappointment. The runtime doesn’t help at all, as I feel there was a lot of unnecessary dialogue and plot points, and I don’t remember ever being as bored as I was during this movie. Don’t get me wrong the cinematography was mesmerizing and there were some absolutely stunning shots, Ari clearly knows how to film a movie, but I just felt there was no point. Like it didn’t feel like anything was happening and it was trying to be some clever cult movie with no real motive. 








Huge shoutout to the special effects crew though, those smashed heads looked insane. Also, that shot where the old guy jumped off the cliff, no cuts or anything just a perfect still shot. That being said i’m cannot wait for his next movie; even if the story is bad, the camera work will be beautiful.",c7y18a

Sort of like a David Lynch vibe but less weird. If you're not able to cast aside your presumptions of what a movie should be like, then I don't think you'll be able to enjoy this film.

&#x200B;

I think ""experience"" movies, are usually more style over substance but what makes them enjoyable to some is that they are unique to everybody in terms of how you experience them. The fact they didn't shy away from the gore was attractive in the sense, your typical instincts might be to be grossed out - but you can't turn away. From the time they get to the compound, the movie takes on the form of a mushroom trip and you kind of have to soak it in with that in mind.",c7y18a

etnru9v,"I really wanted to like this movie, but left feeling so overwhelmed.  I thought the first half was great and kept me on my toes, but then it just followed a predictable course of action without any big twist.  I felt like it wanted to be in the vein of ""Get Out"", where an outsider(s) is chosen to enter a world that seems superficially ideal, but then there is an evil side.  At least with ""Get Out"", there was an unpredictable theme that tied it all together.  There were elements that I really liked about this movie, but I felt like it had so much more potential.

The atmosphere, the uncertainty, the spiraling of the characters and the cult revealing it's true nature, along with the feeling of the group members being trapped and drugged was just fucking too much to take in. This was the first film I ever walked out of, and I'm kind of regretting it because it was incredibly interesting and had so many well presented elements. But on the other hand, I'm really not. The sacrifices of the old people along with their INCREDIBLY graphic demise and revisiting their corpses, the creepy artwork, really creepy setting and people, and not to mention the scene with the half naked dude making demon noises with one of the group members face's as a mask.......Like WTF! Hat's off to Aster, this film felt like a true true horror and everything else in the genre was wishful thinking, really creative camera work, sound design, excellent acting and style. I wish I could've stomached more, and I'm disappointed in myself that I couldn't because apparently it only continued to skyrocket in terms of surreal images and scenes, but the half naked dude and his guttural howling just struck a deep nerve and really freaked me out. Did anyone else have similar reactions? I'm so surprised to read some of the reactions and see that so many were mostly cool with what went down and didn't seem at all disturbed, but perhaps I traversed into the wrong area of films.

I’m a big fan of Ari Aster, after I watched Hereditary I went and watched his short films, and this film just cemented him as one of my favorite filmmakers. It was gorgeously shot and just gorgeous in general, the sunlight, the flowers, colors, everything was beautiful. It was really grotesque as well and I was so shocked at how much head smashing we saw, not sure why but yeah, gross, haha. 

The characters were kinda scummy, especially Christian, and I felt really bad for Dani, the way she let herself get treated. The cult was really creepy in a non-sinister way, if that makes sense. They’re just continuing their traditions but to an outsider it’s terrifying. Also I found it funny how historically, Sweden is neutral, doesn’t like to get too involved but in the movie it’s the Swedish who are murdering Americans, I don’t know, maybe I’m the only one who found the humor in it. 

I was a little disappointed in the bear and Ruben. My issue with both was that I felt they were underutilized. To be honest, I just wanted to see someone be sacrificed to the bear haha.

In a weird way too the movie itself doesn't even really put too much judgment on the cult itself. You can tell that what happens is done entirely in accordance with what they've done for centuries, and the horror comes from the unfortunate consequences for outsiders not prepared for it.",c7y18a

* Florence Pugh's acting was unparalleled. Her reactions during the opening scene was breathtaking. The little fights she and Christian got into were incredibly relatable.

* The cinematography was fantastic. Very balanced frames, loved the single shots with the reflections of those on the opposite sides of the rooms. 

* Probably the most realistic visual affects of what tripping is actually like that I've ever seen. The intensity of the breathing trees and using that as a gauge of where each character was in their trip was a brilliant device.

* The blood eagle was tremendously done. As were there other deaths, the blood eagle just looked 100% real.

All in all, I was blown away and had my expectations far surpassed. Aster is the trauma-ridden lovechild of Darren Aronofsky and Wes Anderson, I'm very excited for his next piece.",c7y18a
eso9ixd,"It’s extremely unnerving that by the end of the movie, you find out that Pelle’s role throughout the whole first part of the movie was to lure them in and practically hold them hostage until the sacrificing ritual was ready to commence. Specifically, a cold scene to look back on that relates to this is Pelle’s horrible yet convincing attempt at comforting Dani with his story of how his mother and father both died in a fire. Dani try’s to resist the temptation of changing her mind from leaving, but she can’t because she knows that this is the only close thing to family she has left. Pelle completely knew this and took full advantage during this scene. The fact that this is only one compelling scene out of all that Pelle was involved in is mind boggling to think about in reflection of watching this film.",c7y18a

And this was my SECOND time trying to see it. I walked out of the opening scene when I went on Friday because the dude next to me was barefoot and inhaling his popcorn. I couldn't even hear Dani speak over his agonized breathing. 

Why are you even going to the theater if you're gonna act this way? Stay at home. Catch it on Redbox. Stop ruining people's moviegoing experience because you want something on in the background while you chomp on your popcorn and fart in your chair.

euqeuc2,"The moment this movie started going downhill for me was when Pelle showed Dani those photos of the recent May queen. That was some of the most blatant foreshadowing I’ve seen in a long time. Wow, now it’s obvious she’s gonna become the May queen and be the “main girl who lives” that I’ve seen a million times before. So dumb. 

And are you honestly going to have me believe that after mark and Josh go missing that Christian and Dani just accept it? Let’s say what the old cult guy told them is to be believed. Josh took the book for himself for his thesis and just ran. Where would he go? They are in the middle of the woods, far from civilization in a foreign country. It makes no sense. If they actually thought about it for more than ten seconds they’d realize it is a total bullshit excuse, and they at the very least should be fearful for Josh’s life if he’s all alone in the middle of nowhere. Ugh. But nah, Christian had one stupid argument with him about a subject for his paper so fuck him. Nobody in real life acts like this. This is B level slasher movie tier writing, making everyone around the main character/characters disappear and then have them pass it off as nothing. 

That suicide ritual scene turned out to be such a waste. Josh and Christian spend what, 4 seconds talking about what is probably the most gruesome thing they’ve seen in their lives before moving on to talking about their thesis papers? And yeah I know josh knew about it going in. He was still visibly shocked like the other outsiders were during that scene. Just because he read about it and knows about it from his research doesn’t mean seeing something like it in person won’t shock him. Everyone except the British couple seem to move on pretty quickly. Even Dani, who has had a murder suicide in her family that still is visibly affecting her (her crying on the plane in the bathroom) seemed to get over it pretty easily. That scene serves no purpose but getting the British couple out of the story. 

So let’s break something else down. The English girl is obviously pissed (congrats on making not everyone in this movie a total dumbass ari!) and demands to leave. A member of the cult tells her her boyfriend left without her. This is obviously super suspicious. She then storms off, a scream is heard (our main characters *clearly* all heat this as they all react to it) then she disappears too. A cult member tells them she left in a car to the train station and they just believe it. This cult must’ve hit the lottery, getting the dumbest and most oblivious people on earth to join them to be sacrificed. Fuck this movie.",c7y18a
esnkghn,"I have several thoughts.

1. Dani's wails at the beginning cut me to my fucking core. I really wonder what she digged into to get into that space. 

2. Hereditary had me uneasy at certain points, this movie basically had me on edge from the first bit of singing over the shots of wilderness and kept me nervous until the final fire was lit.

3. If I went to some cultural exchange and 2 people referenced some ""ritual"" coming the next day and hinted that they knew what it was about. If THAT was the thing they knew about and didn't at least warn me in some way, say hey maybe look away for this next bit. I would punch them in the fucking mouth. Not go to them and say ""hey I'm gonna do my school project on that shit.""

4. Of the ""nightmare"" sequences I've seen this week, I will take Spiderman's over this one any time.

5. This movie did something for me that I normally only get from Sci-fi or Fantasy movies. I really enjoy seeing ""new"" (to me) customs, environments, tools, and experiences. For example the way Fifth Element makes many interesting references or uses of technology, it really felt like I was discovering a new culture the whole time. 

6. This wasn't nearly as ""crazy"" as I expected it to be. It was fucking weird, but I guess I was expecting some supernatural twist similar to Hereditary.

7. The only respite this movie offered was letting me do Jazz Hands as a tension breaker whenever the cult did it.",c7y18a

esqfulk,"The cinematography and acting was obviously top-notch, but overall I was disappointed in this. The first half built a lot of tension for me and had great scenes--the jumping off the clifff scene in particular--and some very ""real"" scenes between the characters. 

By the end...I just wasn't that invested in them any more. After the side friends are killed off and Dani becomes the queen, the rest of the movie felt like Ari Aster trying to stage the coolest/weirdest shot. From that point on the characters just sat around on acid and stared at each other, and I felt more and more detached from them. 

Like with the ""hail Paimon"" stuff in Hereditary, i kept feeling like...what am I meant to feel here? Were scenes like the sex scene, or Christian running around covering his dick, or the locals screaming with Dani meant to be unnerving? Scary? Funny...? They were too goofy for me to be unnerved by. Like Hereditary, it once the movie moved away from the more real-life drama and began to explore the lore/cool cinematography, I became more and more disengaged from the leads and by the end, when I saw their fate, I was just like, oh, okay I guess. 

I'm glad Ari got to make a wide release movie that seems very authentic to whatever his vision was, and I'm sure a lot of people will get a lot out of the cinematogrophy and dissecting the metaphors and rewatching to see clues and all that stuff. For me personally it's frustating because I liked so much in both of this guy's movies that I've seen, and he's so talented, but ultimately his work leaves me cold. I guess maybe his whole thing is just not for me.",c7y18a
esr0c5w,"First of all, I loved Hereditary so much that I saw it 4 times in the theater, but this one was so unnecessarily long and stretched out that by the time things finally started happening, I didn't give a shit anymore.

I rarely throw this word out, but it feels almost self-indulgent. The film spent so much time with the theatrics of the cult that it forgot it had an actual story to tell. Just when you thought it was gaining momentum, it went back down to a flat line. There is no engaging conflict, suspense, or characters to care about, just a long build-up to a climax that felt completely pointless.

There are some things to appreciate here, though. The cinematography is stellar and Ari Aster's vision makes the movie stand out from the rest, but other than that, it is pretty disappointing.",c7y18a

essdocc,"I think I’m in the minority as I found this film much better than Hereditary (but I’m also not a big fan of typical horror films, so it devolving into floating bodies at the end just felt lame compared to the eeriness of everything else). The film is absolutely gorgeous. I love how Aster’s visual flair for making setting feel both so detailed yet so... finite or inescapable (like the dioramas) continues in this film. The writing is a little inconsistent, but overall, it’s very funny. The biggest complaint that I have is that the story overall felt pretty simple—there’s no deep lore and hints of conspiracy that hide in the background like Hereditary did, which I found really fun. Considering the long run time, I feel like it could’ve been shortened up a little without losing much. (And I’ve read in the comments here that there is a much longer cut which would be really interested to see how it expounds upon things). 

Anyway, some minor things that I noticed:

- Dani actually has a large painting in her apartment of a little girl with her head resting against the head of a bear.

- The other cult guy that brings people makes some weird comments where he thought he was dating the girl before her current boyfriend... not sure if that’s just to show how socially awkward these guys can be or if it’s to show a parallel between Pelle also having a crush on Dani. Then again, it seems more like coincidence that Dani ended up going rather than Pelle trying to orchestrate it. 

- Boyfriend’s name is Christian, so at the end, she is choosing to sacrifice a Christian rather than a cult member. Not really sure what sort of symbol or significance there is for him being wrapped in a bear skin. Maybe just an honor for the one that gave his seed to the cult? Or because he’s the one the May Queen chose?

- Mirrors were used a lot in the beginning of the film (before arriving in Sweden): the parents are shown in a mirror before it pans over to them, the boyfriend is framed in the mirror to be in the same shot with Dani, and then it’s used again to frame both of them in the friend’s apartment. Then when tripping, Dani sees her face contort... I don’t think we have any mirrors after that.

- Did the London girl actually leave? Or was she just murdered? I’m guessing the latter, but if so, I wasn’t sure why she wasn’t included in the effigy at the end.

et284sv,"I loved Hereditary and I was very excited to see Midsommar but I gotta say, I was pretty disappointed after watching it.

The cinematography is gorgeous and Florence Pugh's performance is for the most part very good.

Unfortunately, there were some things I didn't like. First of all, I found all other performances below or slightly above  average. The worst performance gave the actors playing the British couple but luckily they had little screen- time.

Secondly,the death of her family had too little impact on the movie. I understand that it is important to show that Dani feels alone and has no one to rely on and therefore, finds a home in this weird cult at the end of the movie. However, I think it would be better to show that she only has a difficult family background and/ or let only her sister commit suicide without killing her parents. The death of her family was not explored much after it happened and also it had no emotional impact on me because we were not introduced to her family but only saw their death bodies.. She was already a very anxious person before their deaths and I couldn't really tell how much this event changed her.

I actually didn't care about any death in the movie. The friends were just there to get killed and we knew very little about them. I also thought they cared too little when the two old people jumped down from the cliff. They were obviously shocked when it happened but it was not a big deal anymore after they went back to the camp.

Finally, the movie explained too little. We could only understand what was going on by looking at the paintings but I still have no idea what this was all about. In Hereditary, we knew that the cult worships a demon and in order to please him they are doing all these horrible things to the family but what was this cult about?!",c7y18a

The simplest way I can describe it is ""beautifully fucked up."" I loved how the whole movie felt like a dream, where stuff is wrong but no one seems to acknowledge it. It is such a surreal experience and I am glad I watched in a cinema with good audio because they made such great use of it to complement the visual haziness in many scenes.

The whole film imo is about adapting to new things. Dani does it best, maybe because she is grasping for something after her traumatic loss. Everyone else who doesn't adapt dies. I wonder what would have happened if more guests had embraced the commune. 

The one reason I did not give this a 10 is that I think it won't hold up at home. Too many distractions and tbh, the film can probably lose a good 20 mins. Still, I loved it and I love Pugh's acting.

ew8cudg,"A24 probably put out half of the best movies I've watched in the last 2 years, including 3 of the top 5 (off the top of my head). I think that any attempt to paint this story as masterful art is ridiculous and even the incredibly time consuming-to-create super trippy visuals were more distracting than anything else. What's the point? Well I have a theory.

The one thing that's really well done in this story is putting you into the shoes - the time, place, situation, events - as the characters. The characters are either trying to have fun but are continually appalled or they are studying what is happening. I think it was like one of the virtual rollercoasters where you go along for a ride. It's 3 hours long so by the end, you believe it will never end. It was a hot day and I went in with just a t shirt and shorts, I nearly had hypothermia when I left. So I was longing to be placed in a bear suit.

This movie is ridiculous. I don't believe it was the intended product. I laughed (not hard, but laughed) a half dozen times at how ridiculous the events taking place were. Positive reviews can't be written off as meaningless because film is an art and art it subjective. But sometimes you see art and you look around and wonder why somebody thinks a piece of art is great, or even good. If Hereditary had never been made, I think this would have lost a huge amount of money. And even with Hereditary as a precursor, I bet people from Sweden are going to see this and find it even more absurd than I do. I give it 2 stars out of ten - one for the filmmakers being ambitious, one for Bandersnatch (don't know his name, he was great in it though).

I swear I'm not being hyperbolic when I say this is one of the worst films I've had the displeasure of watching in the past few years. I even liked *Hereditary*, apart from the ending, and was looking forward to seeing this, though I knew it was considered to be more divisive. I think my issue is that where *Hereditary* had such a strong emotional hook with the intense family drama (which was precipitated by one of the most visceral moments I can recall seeing in film... the death of Charlie), this film had nothing that resonated as strongly.

None of these characters are really developed in any meaningful way (especially the core relationship), and the stakes are set so low, that the whole ordeal seemed like an unintentional parody of the director's past work. And there's also something so hack-like about Aster's direction in this film: the upside-down angles, relentless visual effects to distort trees, food, and bodies... it's seriously distracting and doesn't make him look smart, just over-indulgent, especially when the story is so weak.",c7y18a

Hereditary is a ritual sacrifice told from the perspective of the sacrificial lamb that is, at its core, about a common human struggle (mental illness).  Midsommar is a ritual sacrifice told from the perspective of the sacrificial lamb that is, at its core, about a common human struggle (break-ups).

I think in the future if there are Aster movie marathons Midsommar should be shown before Hereditary.  Its a weaker version of the same story to me (even though it will probably be top 10 for me this year).",c7y18a

et9fvip," Speaking personally, I was disappointed by the movie. I think a lot of that has to do with the marketing. The adverts leaned so heavily on reminding you that Ari directed *Hereditary* and Jordan Peele vouches for how scary it is. “Experience terror in a new light” 

I can’t remember a single moment in the movie that was genuinely scary because this was, despite the way it’s spun, not much of a horror movie. It feels like an art house version of *Wicker Man* or something. The movie is unhinged and weird. But even despite the naked cultists and the gore, the movie isn’t scary so much as just unsettling whereas *Hereditary* seemed able to pull off both. 

**As for some positives:**

The movie was really dense with a lot of it open to interpretation, particularly the meaning of the entire film. Tripping visuals were exactly right and the camera work was grade A. The score really sold the atmosphere and had my heart racing in the cliff scene. The movie was interesting, but I don’t know how much I actually liked it",c7y18a

I’m in the minority here, but this one didn’t click with me. It’s not a bad movie, overall, and I can appreciate the craftsmanship that’s at work here. It’s beautifully shot, and I adored the color palette. It’s also hilarious, and Florence Pugh is incredibly captivated. I couldn’t give this film a lower rating even if I wanted to; because it would be a complete insult to the talent involved. That being said, I did not find this movie disturbing, deep, or moving. There isn’t much here that differentiates this from any other pagan cult horror movies I’ve seen. It’s predictable in spite of its idiosyncratic approach and never as visceral as it could be. I don’t think it’s all that successful at tackling its themes, either. I couldn’t care less about any of the characters, and none of them, besides maybe the main character, even felt like a real person.

etb50b1,"After seeing this movie a few days ago and deciding to let it sink in a bit I have a ton of problems with it. I don’t even know where to start so I’ll just list them:

- Nobody in this movie acts like a real human being. Nobody shows any concern when people go missing. Dani kind of does after the English guy supposedly leaves without his girlfriend (the only two people in this movie that acted like human beings) but that’s about it. You’re in the middle of nowhere surrounded by strange people. You just saw two people jump to their deaths and die in horrific fashion. How are you just so able to accept people suddenly going missing now? The English couple, Mark and Josh all disappear without telling anyone and Christian and Dani just accept it after hearing what the villagers tell them their lies. Why should they believe them? It’s incredibly suspicious but they just brush it off.

- Why did the English girl screaming not raise more suspicion? Everyone in the group obviously hears it. It comes after that crazy suicide ceremony. Yet nobody even mentions it or looks into it. How the fuck do you let that go so easily? It’s supposed to scare us and make us wonder what ended up happening to her and her boyfriend but instead it just frustrated me and took me out of the movie because of how little the way the main characters reacted to it made sense.

- What the fuck is with the conversation josh and Christian have after the suicides? They just go “that was weird” “yep” and then get into an argument about their thesis papers. I don’t have my PhD but I have my college degree so I totally get the pressure and stress these guys must be under but why the hell do they have that conversation at that point in time? They just saw two people kill themselves in horrible and bloody ways and they talk about it like they just saw some drunk shirtless guy run onto the field at a baseball game. 

- Speaking of people’s reactions to that scene, how is Dani totally ok with Pelle and Josh after that? They both knew what would happen and yet didn’t warn anyone. Dani is still deeply affected by her sister’s murder suicide. How the hell can she be ok with them letting her see that without warning her, knowing full well what she’s been through.  She should especially be mad at Pelle. He told her he was sorry about everything she went through. He went out of his way to show he cared, he remembered her birthday and gave her a drawing, he was the only one who told her he was happy she was going and yet he still let her attend the suicide ceremony without warning her. I get it was a part of the cults plan to show her that which is why Pelle didn’t tell her but Dani didn’t know that. She should feel betrayed and should be furious at him.  

- I think the movie had a great chance to pick up after the elders killing themselves. Dani could have finally stood up for herself and confronted Pelle and Josh after being so scared of confrontation. It would be great character development. Plus it would be interesting to see how the cult reacts with Pelle. Dani becoming furious at him and demanding to leave would put a serious wrench in their plans to make her the May queen and I can imagine they’ll be pissed at Pelle since he brought her to them and trusted that she would work for their plans. It would at least make the movie more interesting for me...

- The plot was predictable as hell. This is just a slasher movie with a pretentious coat of paint. People disappear one by one while their friends just act like complete dumbasses and aren’t too concerned at all. It all leads up to the “main girl” being the last one left and getting the best ending out of everyone else. I literally have seen this movie before. Multiple times. For a director like ari aster that everyone praises for hereditary and what a breath of fresh air it was his follow up certainly follows a ton of tropes seen in a million horror movies before it. 

- This movie is slow and meandering. We get it. The people here are strange and have strange traditions. The outsiders are confused about a lot of it. We get it. How many fucking eating outside scenes do we need. There are so many scenes that just felt unnecessary and could have been cut without losing anything.

- The cult’s plan goes off without a single hitch. I have no problem with the “bad guys” winning but it felt so forced having literally every thing they wanted to happen happen. Dani not getting too suspicious after people are disappearing and stumbling into seeing something she shouldn’t see which would make her want nothing to do with the cult. Dani, once again someone who has lost family members in a murder suicide, not freaking out completely after seeing two people killing themselves in front of her and demanding to leave. Dani not refusing to go along with what they want her to do after this incident. Christian not refusing the drugs they give him during the dance scene and thus refusing to fuck that redhead to impregnate her. Nobody steals that truck to get help. Dani not being the one to fall down because of exhaustion or by accident before everyone else did (and yeah I know it was set up so she would win on purpose but she easily could have fallen for real before everyone else pretends to). Dani not looking in to see Christian taking the redhead to pound town. Dani not deciding after all of this that Christian should die. Dani actually being bothered about seeing the dead bodies of the people she came with and the English couple they met being wheeled into that temple. This all could have happened but nope. They sure are lucky.

I felt no dread, no fear, no tension at all during this movie. Just boredom and frustration that the plot wasn’t getting to the obvious point it was leading up to fast enough. I have no interest in any of the hidden stuff people are talking about either. Seeing some shit in the background or some more obvious foreshadowing that I missed the first time around won’t magically make the script suck any less. It won’t make the movie a less meandering burden to get through. People say there’s a message here about grief or adapting to change or something but just because a movie has some deeper message doesn’t make it good. It could be the deepest and most thought provoking shit ever but it won’t change the fact that what led up to it was total garbage. What a load of horseshit.",c7y18a
ev00s6z,"So, **spoilers.**

It's more accessible than Hereditary. It's very good, and many times it felt like watching a vintage horror in pastel colors. It's charming in that sense. You know what's going to happen, so it isn't too surprising, but that doesn't necessarily make it worse than Hereditary. The movie respects that you can figure it out without hand-feeding you the details. There's just enough foreshadowing and information in the background to keep you attentive and in anticipation of the events that unfold. It never tries to betray you with what it gives you.

Aster has a recurring theme of portraying truly frightening things, such as the quiet, cold realism of death, losing, and in this movie's case, a >!breakup. Breakups are frightening because you're ending a relationship, and that change tends to send the people involved on different paths without one another. This idea was exemplified so well in the performances that Florence and Reynor gave together. I can't say I've ever been able to relate to a couple of characters quite as much as I do to both Dani and Christian. I've been on both sides of the relationship failure, where I felt like a high-maintenance individual to someone, and in others where I could not handle a high maintenance partner, but also wanting to make it work despite what my heart was telling me. Dani was very much aware that Christian wanted to end it, but he was all she had after her family died and she had no support system. Christian wanted to end it that first night in the movie, but because her family died, he felt obligated to stay with her, knowing that he was all she had. The movie culminated to their coming to terms with the fact they could not be happy with one another, as painful as that was for them both to admit. The cult was the catalyst for their separation. The ""bad guys"" win again, but it goes deeper than the cult getting exactly what they wanted... they're just doing what they're doing. I'm saying that Dani might be the antagonist of the film, which I'll talk about in a moment.!<

>!Christian was rather cowardly, but I understand why he would drag out their failing relationship. He was wanting for her to dump him. He didn't want to feel guilty for dumping a woman with mental health issues. Maybe the part that felt a bit needless was his wanting to write the thesis about Josh's topic, but it did help Josh come to that impulsive  decision to top Christian by taking pictures of the sacred texts, thus leading to his demise and moving the story forward a bit, and it helped me dislike him a little for being the coward that he was. However, this may have been a red herring because he wasn't particularly a bad guy... just afraid to end the relationship.!<

>!I suspect that Dani assisted in the death of her sister and parents because:!<

1. >!How do you seal the parents' room and sisters' room from the outside in with tape like that on the bottom of the door? Did the sister seal it herself from the outside, run out the house, climb the tree to the second floor where her room was, and make it all happen?!<
2. >!How does Dani know what her sister looks like with a hose taped to her mouth? She must have seen her at some point.!<
3. >!Ativan (lorazepam, generic) may have an adverse effect of impairing memory and judgement. She was shown to be taking these, and coupled with her history of substance use, and under the logic of movies being the way that they are (which is to say, not entirely true to medical facts or mental health), she may have been severely under the influence and forgotten that she assisted in her sister's suicide. Or, she didn't forget and the meds impaired her judgement, thus causing her to assist.!<

>!If it is true that she did assist, then she may have used that at the beginning of the film to guilt trip Christian into staying with her, because she knew he wanted to split. That would make her truly manipulative, further proven by her obvious test of his mettle by going on a 2 month long trip to Sweden that she had no invitation to. She knew she was a fifth wheel. It also explains why she could quickly come to terms with sending Christian to the fire after she discovered he was definitely willing to let her go. That's not a normal reaction. She's unhinged. She's the villain. Manipulated by the cult, sure, but her actions and decisions aren't heroic. Her 30 minute frown, I think, was used to accentuate her evil smile at the very end. If you're up for a rewatch, I encourage you to watch it from that perspective.!<

As an aside, Will Poulter plays an excellent, vapid, peer-pressuring jerk and comic relief. He made me hate and love him so much. Good job, dude. The gore was excellent and top notch, but not particularly scary... and I think that's coming from knowing what to expect from Aster after Hereditary. The sets were great. The acting was great all around. The editing was great. The long take at the beginning with the phone call was personal, powerful, and an excellent way to start the film. Florence is a wonderful actress.

This movie does a nice job of bastardizing those things which we tend to find sacred... flowers, the ""natural"" death of someone, structure, tradition, love, conception... but I feel like Aster does this for the explicit sake of frightening the audience and not so much for the message his framing devices convey. It feels needlessly edgy at times. It's for this reason that I didn't personally like the film. It's an excellent film, however, and if you want to see what Aster is all about, this is a great entry point before checking out Hereditary.",c7y18a
et37rkm,"Maybe I was expecting too much, because I thought hereditary was the best horror of the past few years, but felt EXTREMELY bored with midsommar.

Or panic like a normal human would? Your friends VANISHED in this creepy suicide cult, and you actually consider that maybe they ran off with the book? No one is that dumb.

The decisions and motivations with Dani, Christian and the rest of the group were set off by receiving drugs and being high for most of the time. It just a matter of time for them to follow danger, especially in the final act. This made me feel the characters were hollow and easily manipulated, which I suppose is what the cult was going for.

I did hope that the first part with Dani and her family somehow makes its way throughout the movie but I felt it was just forgotten and left over to splice in some quick shots for the sake of unsettling viewers. The cinematography and how it portrayed dread and tension was the peak of the movie in my opinion (along with the harrowing track that accompanied the incident). I was hoping for more of that throughout the movie however it never did get to that level.",c7y18a

I did think the first half was a bit too long... there were places that could have been cut just to quicken the pace a little... but overall, I think it is a fantastic film. I think what I am most intrigued about is the  Fairy Tale aspect of it... and the allegories evoked that can spark discussion about our modern society.  

The closed society (rise of fascism - particularly in Western European countries) - and the sacrifice of outsiders to further the strength of that society

Life spans are increasing due to better diet and medical care, but sometimes people are alive, but not living... should those that wish to end their lives before they become infirm, be able to? (growing legality of assisted suicide throughout the world) 

Gender roles... no one seems to be mentioning the overwhelmingly traditional gender roles assigned throughout this film (all of the womenfolk are in the kitchen cooking, dressing in gowns with crowns of flowers, vying to be the Queen, putting love spells on men, etc.) while the men of the cult are the ones primarily leading the society and imparting information about that society to the visiting academics (who are also all men)...

There are sections I wish related or added to the central character conflict with a little more emphasis but even when this movie isn't directly confronting the collapse of a toxic relationship, its confident presentation of a quietly unsettling cult movie is respectably engrossing on its own.

I was pretty invested in this movie. It's beautiful. The characters are great. I was very sucked in. By the last quarter I was so bored. Just get to it. We all know this is just heading towards a wicker Man finale and that's what it did. No surprises. 

I guess its cool this generation got a cool version of this type of story, but nothing fresh to it.

*its so weird how this keeps getting downvoted. I'm not even hostile. I liked a lot of things in it. I even thought it was very funny sometimes.

etugwsb,"I like the layered approach to viewer POV, where we're clearly meant to empathize (on some level) with the bullheaded Americans crashing this Swedish haven, and yet their bullheadedness is broadcasted so early as to make them too opinionated to serve as blank-slate audience analogs. Dani, then, is the only remaining sort-of audience analog, and yet her world is so cataclysmically rocked from the movie's outset that she's separated from us (and the others) by worlds of grief before we can even take on her perspective.

That leaves us as viewers in an interesting perspective - fittingly enough, an almost anthropological/sociological one - where we get to watch these Americans we can't totally relate to first react to and then be acted upon by this odd microculture. It helps that the idyllic, gorgeous cinematography is largely shot with a clinical remove, rendering our would-be heroes merely test subjects in a macabre social experiment. It's a fascinating approach, and if it lessens the emotional impact of some of the beats (though Dani, thanks largely to Florence Pugh's magnificent performance, remains a heart-rendingly sympathetic character even through the bitter end), it gives the movie at large an eerily serene feel. Even during the heights of horror, everything feels oddly contained and calm. We're watching these strange-to-vile pagan rituals, sure, but we're also watching these Americans watch them, which is arguably even more interesting than the rituals themselves. I've never seen anything like it, which is what I found myself thinking over and over again while watching the film.",c7y18a

f1fsu98,Just finished watching it and was kinda disappointed to be honest. You could tell pretty much at the get go how it was going to end pretty obviously. It also just felt too heavy handed on symbolism to the point where it became too much,c7y18a
f31jihi,"Here's how it struck me: empathy and the need for empathy taken to the extreme, which is a form of weakness, is potentially terrifying and exactly the substance of what cults are made -- like Dani, being herself extremely dependent (likely a family trace she surely shares with her sister) was the perfect target for Pelle. So instead of growing stronger and more independent, the individual rather gives up completely and nulifies himself in order to feel embraced no matter what, just as an automatic commitment of the group, and everyone's job is to make sure the sacred beliefs (basically ""our group is superior in all sorts of ways"") are reinforced at every turn. The movie of course takes it even beyond the (realist) extreme, encapsulating the whole phenomenon masterfully, and makes that its horror premise: in its nightmare context, all the extreme ""love"" Dani has for Christian, which is actually her own emotional weakness, ends up degenerating, with full force, into frustration and finally venom of the worst kind -- all in favor of the blind, but easy and certain, collective affection.

And the movie conveys all that with nearly perfect aesthetics and cinematography, good enough performances and a thrilling pace from beginning to end. For my tastes, a 9 easily!

**Meta:** it's a sad state of culture that nowadays this movie could never work with genders swapped, and can barely work as it is, for Dani's role and behavior, were her a man, would be inevitably mistaken for ""toxic masculinity"" (which it wouldn't be) -- meanwhile, since she's a woman, the exactly same behavior is even praised by some as [""empowering""](https://clarissaexplainsfa.com/blog/2019/7/5/ari-aster-midsommar-dump-him-female-empowerment-horror) (which of course it's not) and then the whole point of the movie is lost all the same. And that's irony: ideological distortion of plain reality is exactly one of the worst effects of the cultist mentality this movie is all about.",c7y18a
esr7sd1,"I'll just go out and say I didn't like this movie. There was hardly anything enjoyable about it. Not much was unsettling, the characters were eh and just seemed like a bunch of random people and on top of that they were all pretty damn dumb and unaware of shit as simple as keeping track of their own friends. The female lead was fine but one thing got me thinking...

If she didn't win that dancing competition then this movie would've been completely pointless. It would've just been another movie where foreigners die simply because they're foreigners and don't understand the culture they've stumbled onto. I don't see how this shit is any different from movies like Hostel (the first one) in this regard because it's honestly the same exact shit. This was just Hostel in an open field

But going back to her and that competition...that was an ""okay I guess"" moment. I mean, I get it, but not really? It didn't really add much to the story for me. I don't see how she's found her place either. She just found a group of people who are willing to reflect her emotions..someone who'll cry when she cries or be angry when she's angry (and i think earlier in the movie she talked about how she hated how Christian wasn't really like this). To me, it's like she just found a fuckin subreddit. I remember someone (not in this movie) talking about how dangerous the internet is because you could have a gang of suicidal people who just end up worse because they've found a support group that just encourages their thoughts. This was the same thing but with real people

All in all I found this movie to just be pointless. It was a story that wasn't worth telling. It really just felt like most part 2s to good movies before them: It took everything it *thought* was great from the first film (Hereditary) then cranked it up to 11. So if you liked the unsettling feeling...there's a bunch of that for ya here. If you liked the gore, there's even more of that! But the thing this movie lacks is a soul. It's one of the most hollow films I've seen in a while.

And I have a feeling some people will be like ""you missed this"" ""you missed taht"" but honestly, after the guy was like ""So nobody's gonna mention the bear?"" then they panned over that sheet that literally told you the entire movie in order...I just don't care for anything hidden. I can confidently say that I don't care for anything I've missed. That's how hollow this movie felt. It didn't leave me wanting more, it didn't leave me with questions I wanted answered, it didn't leave me with anything. 

To sum it up: This movie was Hostel 1 in the daytime where the lone survivor finds a reddit support group in the end.",c7y18a
esn17g6,"Loved the how fucked up it was, and you definitely need to go into it not expecting Hereditary part two. 

Also, holy fuck the audience at my theater was extremely disrespectful and laughed hysterically throughout the movie. Completely ruined the tone of the movie",c7y18a
esnglbk,"Ari Aster has the potential to direct a modern day horror masterpiece. Unfortunately Midsommar is not this film.

&#x200B;

That being said, there's a lot to admire here. The cinematography, lighting and aesthetic are all masterful and unique. Quite frankly, I love the concept of this movie. The combination of drugs and a European cult in broad daylight is unnervingly trippy and delightfully weird. Speaking of weird, the story does a great job exploring the oddities of an unknown culture. In addition, I absolutely adored the intro and the cliff scene (which is well worth the price of admission). I had a big ol' shit eating grin on my face when that old woman's head split into two. That's S-tier gore that I won't soon forget.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately it was after that scene where the film started to decline IMO. Midsommar has a huge pacing problem as it hits a slump in the second act. As a whole, the movie is unnecessarily and unjustifiably long. This is partially because there are WAY too many themes and subplots in this film. Take the thesis subplot for example. Christian and Josh spend way too much time debating who is going to write what and it doesn't contribute to the film at all. This subplot should have been condensed. Also, wouldn't the ending be more impactful if Christian and Dani weren't on the rocks? Or maybe Ari should have dropped the dead family story line and just focused on Christian and Dani's relationship. My biggest gripe with the storytelling however is the fact that logic and reasoning are blatantly ignored in order to progress the narrative. Why does everyone drink everything they're handed? Oh, because the character's actions wouldn't make sense if they were sober. Why do characters get killed off at random? Oh, because they have nothing else to do so it's time for them to go. Why doesn't Dani ask what happens to the May Queen? Oh, because she needs to dance on screen for 10 god damn minutes. There's one part of the film where a character inquires about Josh and Mark and the question is immediately shot down and ignored for the duration of the film.

&#x200B;

And then there's the sex scene. I'm not sure what the director's intent was, but he totally missed the mark. Everyone in my theater started to laugh because it was laughably bad. So I really can't blame them. I remember people laughing in Hereditary because it was SO tense. They needed to break the tension (and the Wittertainment Code of Conduct) because it was simply too much for them to bear. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for Midsommar. Now that I think about it, the film wasn't very scary or tense at all. I was waiting for a bloody, violent climax and instead the film ends with a disappointing whimper.

&#x200B;

There's simply so much wasted potential here. Why Ari chose not to combine graphic gore with psychadelics is beyond me.

&#x200B;

A theater attendant polled people as they left the theater. He asked whether we loved it or hated it. Now I find this question a bit problematic as most people need time to digest what they've just seen. Regardless, I imagine most moviegoers will dislike this film. It's overwrought, self indulgent, and unrewarding. That being said, I didn't love it or hate it (and I would question anyone who finds themselves on either end of this spectrum). I liked elements of the film, but found the movie as a whole to be very problematic.

In the apartment pre-flight Christian keeps saying, 'I invited her but shes not coming,' in several different ways.

Finally, Dani enters the room and its just like 'yea can't wait lets go'.  I'm confused.

&#x200B;

Also in the apartment pre-flight Mark jokes about the Women in Stockholm and Pelle says something like 'we aren't flying there, we're flying direct' and something about it being the wrong direction from where they fly to. This dialogue is not in the leaked script that I've found to confirm exactly what is said.

Then the Pilot on the flight mentioned Stockholm and they clearly land in what can be assumed to be Stockholm. Mark even makes another comment on the women there while riding shotgun.

esrg1v6,"Ok so I really enjoyed the film but I have 3 questions about it that I would love for anyone to be able to explain further to me.

&#x200B;

1. So the whole thing is that this festival takes place every 90 years? Or does it take place once a year on the solstice? It sounds like every time someone turns 72 they have them sacrificed for reincarnation, and there were pictures of the previous queens, so that makes me think this fest happens every year. But the whole 90 year thing was specifically mentioned but I'm confused what that's all about.
2. In the beginning of the movie, they show Dani's parents ""sleeping"" in the bed when Dani is trying to call them and they won't answer. The camera then focuses on the background to reveal a memorial for Dani's sister (it's her picture surrounded by a bunch of flowers). This insinuates that her sister has died, but the parents just hadn't told Dani yet. But it's later revealed the parents died with Dani's sister, so they would never have known she was dead thus no memorial service. So what was that all about? Am I just remembering what I thought I saw incorrectly or can someone confirm they saw it too?
3. Finally, that church scene. The one where Josh is taking the picture of the book. I'm really more confused about Mark's involvement in the scene. So Mark went off with a girl, she obviously killed him but was that him who came into the church, or was it just his face skinned and placed over someone else's face? Like the Oracle? And did they cut his dick off too or why was he pants less? Also what exactly did that girl do to him? Just skin him and move on orrrr I'm just curious about any theories.
4. Ok bonus question can someone explain all the symbolism with tarot cards and what was going on in the movie and who the characters represented? And if anyone has pictures of the tapestries that foretold all the outcome to the events in the film that would be great OK THAT'S IT THANKS TO ANYONE WHO RESPONDS",c7y18a
esrj6ld,"Lots of good comments on this already but I have another question -- since the movie did a relatively good job of the standard horror movie people getting picked off one by one trope (I really appreciated the long lead-in, it made it feel more natural that people would be hesitant to leave and not sure if this was *really* happening or not). Would it have made any difference had the visitors not ""misbehaved""? Say nobody tried to leave, peed on a tree, or sneaked pictures of their sacred book, what then. Were they just going to tie them up on the last day and put them into the sacrifice house regardless? Or would they have been willing to be more flexible or contemplate substitutions if the visitors had been willing to stay in the community? They do talk about needing new blood to prevent inbreeding, after all. I'm just imagining a scenario where Dani gets love-bombed to the point where she's consciously going along with killing *all* of the people she came with because her new ""family"" just loves and empathizes with her so much.",c7y18a
esrpo94,"So quick question about Pelle, as many say his statement of “my parents died in a fire” foreshadowed the ending. 


Based on other’s comments, his parents might have died in a similar fashion, but say he’s 25 MAX, then the time of his orients death would have to have been sooner than 25 years before the events of this movie.

Mainly, I was impressed with the culture built up and all the little clues that you'd probably need to do a re-watch to catch, like the pictures in Dani's room and all the paintings they framed. Cinematography and sound design also deserves lots of praise.

Yet, I don't think I actually liked the movie. I did think the runtime was too long, and the movie dragged on more than one occasion. I was also disappointed in how little horror this movie had. I love psychological movies, so I was looking forward to this one from the hype. Yet, the only thing in this movie that made me uncomfortable was the opening scene, which was the scene least to do with the main plot. I certainly felt tension as they arrived in Sweden and began their trip, wondering what was about to go on, but then it was about an hour (it seemed) until anything marginally offsetting (the cliff jumping) happened, so that tension just disappeared for me and never came back. Ultimately, I didn't really care about anyone's deaths and there wasn't any shock or feeling of anything.

Too much random creepy shit without any explanation, behavior that I guess we're supposed to believe is some sort of tradition for these people but seem completely disjointed. It was well made, as in shot well and at least somewhat compelling, but it's just another in a line of recent horror movies where the second you start asking ANY questions AT ALL, the entire movie completely falls apart and we're supposed to be okay with that.

No proper coverage to cut down on the length. Wasn’t scary at all. It wasn't a good thriller. If you want an actual thriller watch Taxi Driver. The worst thing I’ve seen in years. 

Edit: For those who are unaware of ""compelling conflict."" The expository scenes were straight out of a college film script since you literally have college students asking the townspeople questions and then they answer. It's boring, it's dumb, it's bad writing, and I don't watch a movie to hear a bunch of information without conflict. I want watch DRAMA.

etpnaq5,"I don't know how I feel about this movie.

Hereditary was one of my favorite films of last year, and Ari Aster has cemented himself as a fantastic filmmaker. There were no shots that felt out of place. Every one was beautiful. The pacing, while very slow, didn't feel like a slog. It was slow and methodical, and I think it was accentuated by the Midnight Sun. The psilocybin trips were very accurate, and I felt a connection with most of the characters. 

The soundtrack and sound design was fantastic as well. The diagetic music was very nice, and I really enjoyed the imperfections in the songs, given that these are people presumably without any formal music training that are playing on homemade instruments. 

I really really enjoyed the conflict between Dani and Christian. I saw this movie with my girlfriend of 1 and a half years, and it really hit close to home. After I got home, we had a conversation about how it was emotionally exhausting having to constantly support her through all her family issues and insecurities, now matter how much I wanted to help her. 

On the other hand, I felt the finale was kind of weak. All of the tension and buildup was fantastic, but I just left fairly underwhelmed. I enjoyed the thematic elements of family and belonging, but the actual surface level stuff I just felt wasn't there. The only parts of the movie that I was viscerally disturbed by were the various shots of the sister with the hose taped to her mouth and the body strung up in the chicken coop. 

All in all, while I enjoyed the film and plan on a second viewing while it's still in theaters, I don't know how it will hold up in my eyes a year from now. It's not a masterpiece like Hereditary, but it's still a very well done movie all the same. I look forward to the next outing by Ari Aster, as he is one of the best indie filmmakers around right now.",c7y18a

He knew she’d be May Queen and I think eventually his “love”. When the women matched Dani’s cries and grief - oh man. I felt that IN MY SOUL. Her personal peace and ridding the affekts in her life really hit the nail on the head. 

I also think that Pelle’s new family found him after his biological family died. I’m not convinced that he’s always been a part of that community.

Was it significant when Pelle's brother slipped up and said he was dating the British girl before she started dating Simon, and she swiftly corrected him by saying 'one date'?

There was that conversation about how a new inbred child would need to be born, and usually scenes with Maya and Christian moments were followed by shots of the inbred child. And then they both had red hair... Well. I'm reaching, but it felt like they were painting inbred babies as something significant.

f3isi0l,"This was an....interesting movie.  I loved hereditary, think it's easily one of the best ""horror"" movies of the least decade.  So i had high hopes for this.  Unfortunately it failed to come close to that in my view.  After thinking about it I think there are 3 reasons for that, the script, the story, and the acting.  
     I'll start with the story.  I don't think that there was enough backstory for characters and a lot of bloat throughout the runtime that would have been better served giving more backstory to the characters.  Show more about christian and his friends, show more about the relationship with Dani and why he may have been feeling like ending things, show more about Dani and her family.  There was too much nothing in the commune.  Also, there needs to be some twist in my opinion.  Once the suicide happened i was ready for things to get rolling and it just sputtered out and chugged along.  Not to mention all the random character interactions that happened and turns in character.
    Next, the acting.  This is a far cry from hereditary.  The actors just could not carry this movie.  I think they were all terrible across the board.  Christian was particularly bad since that is a vital role in this film and he should have conveyed a conflict of what to do and how much he may have been suffering from what it was like being in a relationship with Dani much more than he did.  Part of the problem is the story, yes, but the actor needed to do a much better job of conveying the turmoil than he did and that makes him just seem like an asshole when it shouldn't be the case and would make for a better, more complex film.  The side characters were all jokes as well.  Just straight up caricatures.",c7y18a

Although I personally disagreed, there are a lot of things that support that theory. 
For example, in the beginning Pele says to Christian “think of all the girls you’ll impregnate in June.” At first it sounded like locker room talk but we later found it to be quite literal. 
They also believed Dani killed her family in the beginning. Her sister had the hose duct taped to her mouth which to me seemed as overkill. Also when she was having her nightmare and she had the exhaust coming out of her mouth, it may have been feelings of guilt?

It had hints of themes of grief and culture but I really think the movie said nothing in the end. Also the relationship between Dani and her boyfriend weren’t flushed out enough. He ends up being there for her in her grief and they don’t make him out to be enough of an asshole as the movie *seems* to want us to view him as.

Friend and I were both worried and excited seeing this since Hereditary left us feeling kind of in shock and unsettled.

This movie is beautiful but pointless.

In the end, what was the point of everything? There was nothing supernatural. They sacrificed people to bless their crops, as cults do. That's it.

The only real sort of deep meaning was the main character finding a ""family"". One that would share her joy and pain and make her feel loved.

She was great in this by the way. The boyfriend was annoying. The only likable side character just kinda died. Stuff happened for no reason Like the boyfriend deciding to do his thesis there. Or they made a big deal about people dying at 72 (I assume that's how old the cliff jumpers were) but really it didn't have anything to do with anything.

Some stuff was super corny. The seeds go in, then the meat. OK whatever. Then the cracked egg. Eyeroll. Oh and the ~~hand~~ foot (as /u/CDC_ so *kindly* pointed out) sticking out of the ground.

The deformed guy had NOTHING to do with anything even though they marketed him.

First off there’s no need for this movie to be so damn long. Did we really need so many scenes of them eating outside? And what the fuck was up with the English girl’s death? When they all heard that scream did they just ignore it? Dani hears from an older man in the village she left and she just seems to accept it. And no questions about that scream and none of her friends talk about it either. How convenient. Nobody in this movie acts like a real person. They all just saw two people jump off a cliff to their deaths. They should be more cautious than this. Did they think it was just another dumb tradition? They also didn’t really care too much when their friend who pissed on that tree went missing. 

Everyone in this movie acts like an idiot and is just there to be killed. It’s so obvious who’s going to live to the end and who will die along the way. It’s predictable as hell. As soon as the Swedish dude showed Dani those pictures of the May queen during a previous ceremony I knew immediately she was gonna become the May queen and kill/betray her boyfriend. That foreshadowing was as subtle as a nuclear bomb. Since this movie doesn’t have jump scares and has some generic message about grief (it’s a film about grief) then people will pretend it was super disturbing and deep.

I’ll give it props where it was due: the scene when Dani’s sister kills herself and her parents and her reaction to it was really well done. The actress did a great job reacting to it.

etcerea,"Also, one thing I've taken from this that I don't think others have... I had some sympathy for Christian. I could see a little bit of myself in him. It's not easy being an emotional crutch for someone, and it can be exhausting. He wasn't a perfect guy who was always making the correct choices or acting selfless, but ultimately he was also trying to support his girlfriend and was trying to make some sacrifices for her. So I think he's both douchey and somewhat relatable. I'm not sure if the film was trying to present him as that.",c7y18a

it was quite bad.

poorly written. none of the characters are active. all of them just exist to have bad things happen to them. they have zero agency. not at all compelling.

and it wasnt even scary. Disturbing imagery, but the pacing was terrible, and as a result my most felt emotion was boredom. especially towards the end.

i literally laughed out loud numerous times. i dont think that was intended.

I thought it was just too predictable, it's not like John Wick either where I can enjoy watching him kick ass even though it's predictable, there's much less tension when you know what to expect.

""When Jesus Christ was nailed on the cross, he expires at the ninth hour. Also Jesus appears a total of nine times to his apostles and disciplines after his resurrection.""

So normally I am a sucker for these things in movies but with this I felt after that ending it was all pretentious and way for a director to cover up a bad story and characters. And I really thought about this. I don't know I really wanted to like this film but just couldn't. So I wanted to ask people who are giving this 10 and 9 score what they found so great apart from the obvious visuals and camera work I mentioned. I thought this film had one of the most cliche and terrible characters in a horror film. The main character Dani whom we are supposed to be sympathetic with had no redeeming quality about her apart from her losing her parents and her struggle to cope with it. She basically sacrifices her boyfriend by burning her alive and that is supposed to be her main transformation of accepting she has now a family. I have seen many films with a self-indulgent metaphor but this film takes the cake. There are people who have also said the bf deserved it. But I am sorry are we watching the same film? In no way was the bf even rude to her that made her fair in burning him alive. Switch the gender and the same people will attack it for having ""toxic masculinity"". I also saw people saying it showed her having a real family at the end. So are are supposed to root for her at her having ""happy ending"" but she is not even the same character who was at the start of the film and her character change made no sense at all just because she did some sort of drugs and performed in some sort of weird culture no one ever heard of.

esrf0cd,"It's hard to get a handle on Midsommar, there is a lot going on with Ari Aster's sophomore effort. Those looking to find the next level in horror will surely be disappointed. This is more in line with his efforts in Hereditary, especially when both films deal with grief in such a personal and horrific way. This time around he feels like he can be a bit more creative with the camera, moving freely in the open land and leaving the family drama behind for a more blunt horror experience. With that being said, Midsommar is still not your typical horror film. 

After a devastating loss in her life, Dani's relationship with her ""on the fence"" boyfriend gets even more strained. He plans on leaving for Sweden with his three friends, one of which is from there. He invites her to go with them, expecting her to say no, but she agrees and they soon find themselves at the mercy of a pagan cult.

It's easy to make things scary when things take place at night, Aster has the ambition to craft a horror film that takes place entirely in the daytime. He expertly crafts a sense of dread throughout the film, which is an incredibly slow burner one as well. We know what to expect, to some degree, when these people arrive at this commune, in the middle of nowhere. The characters of course, do not. We as an audience know we are watching a horror film, the characters think they are just at a friend's family home. Slowly the safety and sanity is picked away one by one, until we have no idea what we are witnessing and neither do the characters. Is a drink being offered simply a drink? Or is there something more sinister in the liquid? These were questions I was constantly asking myself throughout the film. 

Is the film scary? Not at all. It's terrifying in a morbid way, but you never feel scared. Instead you are repulsed by the imagery Aster forces you to watch. These images are violent in nature, absurd to the next level and are few and far between. He simply sprinkles these moments in, which add a shock value because everything leading up to these moments have been a little slow. 

Florence Pugh leads the film and has the difficult task of being incredibly fragile, but needing to be a strong presence. She pulls it off with ease. Hearing her tormented crying is painful and strikes right through the heart. The rest of the cast includes her boyfriend played by Jack Reynor and his three friends, played by William Jackson Harper, Vilhelm Blomgren and Will Poulter. You look at these people and you just know that nothing good is going to happen to them. 

I suspect that this film will be dissected, much like Jordan Peele's recent horror entry, Us. Aster litters the film with literal images depicting what could possibly happen to these characters at some point in time. You'll be looking in the background for these pictures to get a sense of what's to come. One sequence uses this to comedic effect, which then turns extremely weird and than horrifying. That's how Midsommar is in a nutshell. It plays with tone and at points the audience is laughing at the absurdity on the screen. I still have no idea if the funny bits are intentional or not. 

I do prefer Hereditary to this, as I was simply not prepared for that film whatsoever. It left me speechless. Midsommar treads familiar ground and could leave some people shocked, but it might even leave some people wanting more. Aster, after two films is an auteur and he loves taking his time getting to where he wants you to go, to the point where it could frustrate some viewers.",c7y18a
essc43w,"The only part that I don't like about this film is what happens if things don't work out absolutely perfectly for the cult? They brought 6 outsiders, and as few as 4 of them could be sacrificed. Do they let the other 2 go and talk? Do they kill them? I think it could have added to Dani's choice at the end if there was an underlying threat of ""you and your friends are never getting away anyway"".",c7y18a

&#x200B;

Edit: to clarify, I do understand that her grief relating to her family was pretty much the point of the film. The cult is her new family. My question is 1) why the specific manner of murder-suicide and 2) why the sister texted about going into darkness 3) why she wanted to also kill her parents

I also wouldn’t really think they’d be so isolated that they wouldn’t know the risk of being caught had increased since they do send their own members abroad periodically apparently.

I'm kind of surprised by the complete ""We're doing whatever"" attitude of most of the characters.

I guess maybe the drug influence was strong by then?

At 2.5 hours, the movie feels both underwritten and lacking in momentum for the third act to really deliver. When we finally get to payoffs like the mating ritual, it felt too easy for the movie to over-rely on creepy setups. It’s the artsy inverse of Sandler gross-out comedies but well-composed, color-graded, and set to a serviceable soundtrack to fool everyone that there’s more to it. 

And puhh-lease at people saying this movie does a great job at portraying grief. Dani’s family dies in the most contrived setup imaginable for a self-indulgent montage drowning in atmosphere, and Dani’s grief is just a catalyst for showing us what a dingus her boyfriend is.

However, my biggest gripe... I was pulled out of the experience abruptly the moment after the suicides when the two guys began arguing over their thesis stuff. The dialogue up until that point was so so realistic. From there I think the movie dived a bit into the cliche, (the dude going in to steal photos of the scripture ONE fucking night after deciding this was the place to study...)

So from watching this movie, what I got out of it was how it seemed to be some sort of commentary on rituals. Like for me it made me think of the rituals that we all go through and just accept without questioning in our daily lives. The characters who came to the commune were horrified and confused at what they saw, but for the people in the commune these were normal ceremonies, nothing out of the ordinary. I feel like that idea kinda makes you question the rituals you go through in life. For me, I thought of going to church. Christianity is centered around a human sacrifice. Every Sunday, people go to a building adorned with stained glass and paintings depicting parables and stories of supernatural events, dressed up in their nicest clothes to spend a few hours chanting in unison, confessing their sins and preparing to drink the blood and body of a man that came to redeem the world of its sins. The central symbol of the Catholic church is literally a man nailed to an ancient torture device. But to most of us, this is a usual Sunday service. Imagine if outsider coming to one of those, and trying to process it. The idea is terrifying when you think about it. And many other religions are based on similar rituals. Even rituals in our home, our workplace, our social lives, it makes you think about some of the darker elements hiding in all of those.

Christian was just a colossal idiot, almost unbelievably at times.  I did like the actor who played Pelle and found him compelling—doesn't help that the rest of the guys are such assholes all the time.

The gore seemed unnecessarily gross and had a ""haha made you look!"" aspect to it when it keeps flashing back.  Especially because Aster already did it in Hereditary, it starts to feel like a cheap trick.  The jumping scene was pretty creepy, but the gore itself wasn't scary, just gross.

I'm a sucker for cult stuff especially when it connects to ancient folklore and art, and the design of the camp clearly had a lot of thought put into it.  Very refreshing to have a horror movie take place entirely in daylight where you can see everything!  No squinting necessary...

Didn't have many jump scares (fine by me) but I thought it was legitimately intense and scary.

Someone said below they are said Ari Aster is moving on from horror but....  He relied on a LOT of the same tricks to make Midsommar and Hereditary work.  I could see that well getting dry fast, so will be good to see him take on something else.",c7y18a
et5h6za,"Saw it with a bunch of friends tonight, was very entertaining. The only part that I didn't like was the incredibly dark part in the very beginning with Dani's family and the suicide, but apart from that everything else was just...splendid. Lots of foreshadowing and imagery to see what was coming next, just in general a lot of weirdness which is exactly what I was expecting out of this movie.

The movie was crazy disturbing but tbh I think that cliff scene made me super anxious as I hate gore scenes so then onwards  whole movie my focus was on getting to the end without having to see any similar scenes like that.

esnhbjv,"Midsommar brought to use by horror prodigy Ari Aster could have been so much more. Most people are familiar with Ari for his breakthrough film Hereditary. A good percentage of people (myself included) found that to be one of the best horror movies of the decade and were clamoring for Ari's next work. In comes Midsommar a sunny acid trip to Sweden. Right off the bat, the audience is treated to a sorrowful pitch black opening, that while serving its purpose left more to be desired.

If you're reading this you know what Midsommar is about. We get a good hour of buildup before anything out of ordinary happens. Once that shockingly gruesome moment happens it's as if we've reached a crossroads. The director had a few different paths to take from there, and he took a more self-indulgent strange one. Unsettling music, obtuse camera work, trippy visuals, long drawn out scenes, head-scratching moments, a disfigured mongoloid, comical quips (both intentional and unintentional) Midsommar is a messy mixed bag.

This film could have been more than another beautiful to look at, but hollow art piece. Ultimately it's hard to call it anything more than that. We are left without explanations for some big things, some elements feel like they were thrown in for no real reason outside of being visually jarring (see earlier mentioned mongoloid), and a lot of this movie feels overlong and dragging. Often times taking itself way too seriously and feeling like it was trying too hard.

Just as these types of movies usually do we have some allegories here. We don't, however, have much horror at all. The viewer gets occasional feelings of dread and despair, but this is more of a drama than anything else which I'm not faulting it for, the marketing would just have you think otherwise.

I can see the appeal, and it wasn't horrible but Midsommar drops into some pitfalls that I can't forgive it for. I left the theater just wanting more ultimately unsatisfied with what I was given.",c7y18a
esnkyux,"Honestly this movie just wasn’t good.. and it feels terrible to say that with how much I loved Hereditary. I legitimately thought Ari was onto something and pushing walls and boundaries but this fell so short. Not once during the whole film did I ever feel scared or worried for the characters because I already knew what was going to happen. There were no stakes at all and it was incredibly predictable leaving me thinking “okay when is this person going to die or this person..” the only redeeming thing was Florence’s performance and the cinematography,  but even with that there were so many camera flips and rotations I felt like I was getting bashed in the head with “ARE YOU FEELING UNSETTLED YET?!” 

But by far the most disappointing thing about this movie was again, with Hereditary I felt like every member of that family was so justified in their actions and words because they were suffering so much and I could feel why all of them felt the way they did. It was horrible to watch them breakdown and fuck up and be tormented by what happened but with this? I could only feel for Dani. I felt like the boyfriend and all his friends were massive dicks and by the end of the movie I was happy seeing them all dead and her smile. I didn’t feel taken back at all and a got a really wholesome girl power vibe from it. I just wasn’t invested in any of them and didn’t really care, I already knew they were going to die because “Americans go to foreign country and die” has happened soooooo many times before. 

I feel like this is going to be a movie where people will say “oh you don’t get it” or “it’s for arthouse horror fans” when in reality it just falls short on writing, characters, plot, tension, theme, and tone and if you actually try to break it down the story crumbles and turns into just a movie about acid. It builds this world but answers no questions, (the oracle, the scripture, 90 years or every year?) it creates sub plots between characters that haven’t been earned (the thesis argument), explains things but then decides to take them away (the girl giving Christian a love potion but then they drug him anyways and we already knew he was a dick of a boyfriend and would probably cheat on Dani anyways?? So why was the potion necessary??, the friend peeing on the log of dead ancestors but they were also just going to kill him anyways?? Burying the one guy with his foot out of the ground and then unburying him to burn him? Why did they have to flay open that one guy?) Honestly I just feel like he tried to recreate another Hereditary but missed out on what made that movie so special.

Dani’s family dying in the beginning. What did that have to do with anything that happens later in the movie? Great opening scene, but it didn’t add much other than make dani’s emotions unstable for the rest of the movie

Pelle drawings. I was waiting for some significance. Nothing. 

Hallucinating that she’s a plant. Just a bad trip? Ok

Any point to having mark’s back flayed and hanging over some chickens? Or just for shock value? I was expecting something like, they wanted to keep him alive (lungs were working) so that his body could be fresh so they could eat him. Or keep him alive so that his body keeps making sperm. But nah, just to shock the viewer. No plot value

Sleeping pills? There was weird emphasis on the sleeping pills

Pelles parents dying in a fire. I immediately thought they were burned. I was waiting for a surprise or something valuable to come out of that. Nope, just that he his parents were probably sacrificed. Ok

I think after seeing this film I will never see another horror film in theatres. It's my fault, I fell into a ""critically acclaimed"" hyped up by the web on end trap. The movie is closer to Tree of Life than any of the other genres it's listed as. I feel like I just saw the movie version of MoMA and I couldn't be more disappointed.

It was essentially as if someone who saw Hereditary was challenged to recycle most of the main elements with the additional challenges of a goofy culture (I don't mean to be disrespectful, they obviously meant to make the culture caricatured in order to make it different but it was not successful and just distracting) and bright sunshine that serves no purpose.

esoi3kq,"Alright, now that I’ve gathered my thoughts, i’ll give a little write-up. To preface this, I thought Hereditary was excellent. Instantly wanted to see this because of it.

I was disappointed, probably give it a 5.5/10. The themes were great (love the grief and mourning stuff, that scene at the end when she’s screaming and everyone is screaming with her is pretty genius), the acting was good, the cinematography was downright gorgeous but i had 2 major issues:

1) my God the movie moves at a snails pace. It literally takes like an 1 hr 45 minutes to crank up the pace and even then the last act was just pretty good in my opinion. 

2) The story was super telegraphed. No, it wasnt foreshadowed, Ari showed nearly his entire hand the moment the red head girl was shown making a single meat pie. You really gotta have some twists in there if you’re gonna tell us that Christian will cheat and that Dani will be the May Queen from the get go.

I’d also say that aside from the screaming scene i mentioned above, the movie never gets as visceral as it could have been. Psychedelic sure, but nothing particularly crazy. Even on the cliff jump scene I felt like they went a bit too far with the hammer to the point where you can tell the bodies are obviously rubber",c7y18a
esuez2y,"Disappointed in this. I didn't really expect straight up horror, but I expected creepy. There were 4-5 creepy scenes and that was it. 

What I loved about Hereditary was the progression of things, how characters' actions advanced the movie and how they blended the horror of grief with the actual cult stuff.

This felt flat. Like you never really root for anyone or are interested in what they do because you know they'll die one way or another. The long shots don't really serve a purpose of creating suspense because we know what's happening. This people will die, and when they do, we never see it. I was just waiting for it to happen. It wasn't a bad movie, it was just art project more than anything.",c7y18a
evusdq5,"I was unimpressed with this movie over all, I feel like Ari Aster was attempting 'culture shock' with the audience along with his favoured disturbing images.

Also if you pay attention to details, and even if you don't, it's entirely predictable. The editing and cinematography is probably the best thing about it.",c7y18a

The actual horror elements were scary but by the end it felt like a greatest hits of ""scary pagan rituals"". The film wasn't really actually going anywhere with any of it.

eta6us7,"I wanted to give this movie a couple of days to sort of ""soak in"" a bit before more or less making my mind up about it.

I think I would give it a 6.5 out of 10 on my own (admittedly tough) personal scale:

Pros:

This is a very, very unique movie, I'm not even sure there's a box to check for this one.  It's tough to call it a horror or suspense movie, for example.  That's a very big plus in my mind.

The cinematography and color palette in general was really well done, this movie was a visual feast, especially (fittingly enough) at the feasts themselves IMO.

I thought that SOME of the acting was very good, the lead actress and pretty much all of the Northern European ""cult members"" were all phenomenal for the most part I thought.

Cons:

This movie went on a bit long.  I think you could take out the entire mushroom sequence, for example, and the entire movie as a whole doesn't lose a thing.  I guess the point of that scene was to show that the boyfriend and his friends are dicks (we've already established that though, I think) and the lead character was not in a good place at the moment (again, already established).

There were a lot of moments that felt very out of place in this movie... showing the black character (LOVE him in the Good Place) die on screen like that I suppose was supposed to be shocking or something like the old couple jumping off the cliff, but IMO it just doesn't work at all, you see it coming from a mile away and we've already been ""shocked"" by a far more gruesome clubbing just a few scenes earlier.  It's weird out of all of the offscreen deaths that occurred in the movie, this is the one we are shown.  I think it would have been far more effective to show one of the London couple running for the woods in the background in a different shot for instance (only to get clothelined/clubbed from someone waiting in the woods) while everyone else is happily feasting.

What the hell was up with the boyfriend and his friends?  I just didn't buy them (AT ALL) being anthropology PhD students, the black character for sure I guess, but he didn't fit in at all with the ""We're the Millers"" character, who seemed to be the horny teenager stereotype.  It was just an odd mix that I didn't buy as characters in the slightest, they seemed to go back and forth between wanting to be horny college kids and serious anthropology students with no rhyme or reason.

I didn't understand why the murder/suicide had to be a thing at the beginning... I guess just to make her family's death all the more visceral?  Otherwise it seemed like it could have just been a car crash or something and it would have been just as effective.  I expected it to be more relevant to the plot in some way as the murder/suicide.  

Why be so predictable and telegraph everything?  And have the college students be so dumb and go along with everything blindly?  It seemed like it was done on purpose I guess, but I just don't understand the point of it.  Why bother trying to make them anthropology students in the first place?

Overall I liked the movie and really appreciated the uniqueness of it.  But it's a very, very flawed movie.",c7y18a
etsucau,"My findings of this incredible movie:

1. The first festival activity is the suicide of the two villagers. This was the first sign of Dani joining the cult. The way the villagers justified suicide, made her feel less guilty about her sisters death. 

2. According to Pelles explanation of the age groups corresponding with the seasons, Midsommar actually happens every 9 years, not 90.

3. When Pelle said his parents died in the fire, they died in the previous midsommar sacrifice. 

4. The baby crying we never see, is the next inbred oracle for the next midsommar that will take place in 9 years. The current oracle was born at the previous midsommar 9 years ago. 

5. All of the outsiders were kept high on hallucinagenics the whole movie. It wasnt until Dani's  breakthrough (the sisterhood of women greaving on the floor) when she sobered up and realized she needed to let Christian go.",c7y18a

etbxvol,"Easily one of my least favorite films of all time. 

I was checking the time by the final sequence, the long drawn out shots of people slowly putting pieces together that the audience had already figured out 20 minutes prior were obnoxious. 

I've never walked out of a theater and thought ""What the fuck was the point of that?"" Before,  this was a first for me. Hereditary was amazing, a really fresh experience that used a big reveal towards the end to tie together dozens of tiny plot elements for a very satisfying and dark ending. This movie was just a mess of tired shock value garbage and more of Ari's weird fetish for naked old people. 

The sex scene was just annoying, it stopped being atmospheric or unsettling half way through and I just wanted it to be over and for the credits to finally, mercifully, roll. 

I have NO idea how this film has such high ratings, at all.  The theater I saw it in was about half full, but by the end it was less than a quarter. About 3 couple's got up and left when the sex scene started, the rest left sometime before then.

et14qid,"I'm trying to put my finger on what it is about Ari Aster that I just don't connect with. I walked out of Hereditary during the wailing mom scene, then forced myself to go back and watch it again the whole way through and thought it was a decent horror movie that just didn't work for me. I was bitten by the horror bug with Halloween when I was 8 years old, was reading Stephen King by the age of 10, loved The Thing, American Werewolf, Dawn of the Dead/Day of the Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street, and into the modern era have been a fan of movies like The Ring, The Orphanage, 28 Days Later, The Conjuring, Train to Busan, Get Out, Babadook, The Witch, etc... So I consider myself a fan of horror movies, but I just don't get Ari Aster.   


I watched Midsommar tonight and had high hopes after the hype leading up to it and my overall appreciation for what Aster did with Hereditary. But after watching that movie tonight I kind of feel like he's a one trick pony. Amp up to unbearable levels scenes of unfathomable grief to manipulate the audience. Cut to extreme gore close ups to generate maximum discomfort. Then insert bizarre art film tropes throughout the rest of the film to give a pretentious ""art house"" air. I didn't see anything new at all in Midsommar, and maybe that's old man me talking... clearly he hits a nerve with a target audience, but I'll take a pass on whatever he comes up with next, because honestly I've probably seen it before (Rosemary's Baby, Wicker Man, etc).

f3oban2,"Did anyone else find super disturbing the angry, weeping man who finds out Will Poulter's character pissed on the tree? 

Obviously the villagers are in some sense fanatics about their rituals and beliefs. Will Poulter's character Mark does something completely uncontroversial and expected (the guy needed to pee, it's not a big deal), and the reaction from the villager is just flat-out. chilling and disturbing. Mark did nothing wrong, but the villager takes it as this utterly offensive and evil affront to him and his ancestors. And of course Mark is murdered in retaliation.

I thought it brilliantly and effectively showed the kind of social consequence of a type of fanaticism, particularly religious fanaticism. The villager is so angered and offended and saddened. Then he uses his sadness, anger, and victim status as a weapon to rally the villagers against Poulter's character. Mark did such an innocuous thing in the eyes of most of us, but to a kind of fanatic Mark committed an unpardonable sin and must be put to death.

esst28x,"I have read hundreds and hundreds of comments on here and I keep looking for someone to point out the line Mark says when they first get to the commune - something along the lines of “are we stopping by Waco on our way to Harga” — also - I cannot find a proper spelling of the sacred text that goes “missing” but it’s “ruby” or “rubi” something - ruby rotter? Ruby rather?  Either way - reminiscent of Ruby Ridge - the stand-off that, in conjunction with the one at Waco, is thought to have lead to OKC bombing. It just seems like both were sly references to crazy white people. 

Really liked this movie, though it was very different than what I was anticipating - loved Hereditary, still have PTSD when I hear a cluck noise - haven’t rewatched Hereditary because it scared me so much, but this one would be an easy rewatch for me.",c7y18a
et8krb0,"As weird as this is about to sound, I don’t think the possibility of anything in this movie is far fetched. I saw someone else downvoted for this, but hear me out: 

When Josh was struck over the head with the mallet, he immediately hit the floor. The screen panned to the man wearing Mark’s face. At that point, you hear a weird grunting noise that’s paired with what sounds like a body being nudged against a surface. It pans back to Josh and you can see his body going back&forth, back&forth, and back&forth. If he was grunting or gasping for air, he probably wouldn’t be moving in that horizontal direction with such precise rhythm. It looks like his body is not convulsing, but in fact being moved by another force. His movements are paired with the grunting noises in harmony (for lack of better terms). 

Am I the only fucking person that thought he was being raped? It looked like a woman hit him over the head with the mallet, and with Mark’s new face owner standing in front of his body, the only likely culprit would have been the beast born from incest. Lmk if that was just me, and I’m as sick and twisted as Ari Aster. K thx.",c7y18a
etb4zp7,"I think I overall liked the film  as a film, but as a horror movie it wasn't what I was expecting or hoping for.

Like taken completely out of external context, it was an interesting film about dealing with grief and exploring completely different customs and not automatically assuming the worst of them just cause they do some weird shit (but still having to be wary of underestimating a culture one doesn't understand). There were some gorgeous and some unsettling shots that really helped contribute to a mood of everything just being weird and unusual. 

That said, the tone wasn't always consistent. There was a *lot* of humor in the film, some of which was good (e.g., it worked as dark humor or to act as a satire of people trying to understand a foreign culture), but as a horror film (or at least a film marketed as one), at no point was I scared, and for most of the film I wasn't even uneasy. It definitely felt a bit too jovial at times for my tastes, and not creepy enough as a whole. The ritual scene near the end had people bursting out laughing, which wasn't really what I was looking for while watching a penultimate scene. In general it felt like there would be some dread that fizzled into nothing, more dread that fizzled into a joke, etc.; I wish the film had been able to build to more than it did in the dread department.",c7y18a
esngw7g,"My take:

The Americans visiting the Swedish cult is somewhat representative of the various ways Westerners have interacted with indigenous cultures. Josh represents the academic attempt to understand and analyze a culture. Mark, on the other hand, represents the ignorance that indigenous cultures were often met with, as Mark never seemed to care about the culture of the people but rather what he could get from them (sex, drugs, food). 

On another note, I found the cliff scene completely horrific, possibly one of the most disturbing things I've seen in a film. What's interesting, though, is that the ""cliff jumpers"" voluntarily jumped to their deaths, and as Christian said, the cult members would probably be shocked by the fact that in America the elderly are put in nursing homes. So basically, the most disturbing scene in the film was a happy occasion for the cult members. Very interesting.",c7y18a

esvh7g6,"Seeing Hereditary in the theater was one of the tensest movies I’ve ever seen. People compare Aster to Jordan Peele because they came out around the same time and I feel Hereditary is by far the best movie in the four that were made by either man up to this point. 

Not sure if I can spoiler here so I’ll discuss my reasons very vaguely for why Midsommer is not as good. I literally got back from having seen it about 5 minutes ago. 

1. For as careful director as Aster is, the fact that the beginning of this movie is as vivid and disturbing as it is while having no real connection to the rest of the movie, is baffling to me. I understand that it sets up the mindset of some of the characters but I believe there were other ways to have done that which would not have caused me to wonder when we were returning to that point. 

2. There is a character for whom, if the ending is to work, we have to hate. It feels like that character’s arc to get us to that point is unnatural and manipulated. 

3. Some things were not particularly well explained and were gruesome for the sake of being gruesome. 

4. The ending, I felt was ambiguous but in a way that resulted in more of a shrug than wanting to think it over and come to my own conclusion. 

5. The last third of the movie seems to go on and on. I have read that there was a 4 hour cut of this film but I think Aster could have pulled 10 minutes off the run time relatively easily and not missed much. 

6. I read a review that the characters felt closer to objects than real people with real intentions and motivations. Yes. 

I loved the look of the movie and the music. I thought the whole commune was creepy but I also felt like the movie never gelled to more than the sum of its parts. I also felt there is a “fool me once shame on you...” feel with the subject matter being relatively close to his first movie.",c7y18a

What we see throughout the movie is her feeling lost, not knowing why she chose to go, and doubting her relationship, we’ll call this “Limbo”. Throughout the movie the villagers focus on her, choosing her for special ceremonies, grieving and crying with her and even Pele takes an interest in her. Dani has suspicions about the village throughout the film, asking about the other tourists, nightmares, etc. All this time Dani was being brainwashed by Pele, brainwashed by the villagers making her smile during the May Queen dance. In the last scene, she even looks at Christian and despite being suspicious and mad at him, she lets him go while she continues the festivities. At the end of the movie, her cycle of life ends as she has found a new home, a home where everyone is a parent, a home where she is cared for and celebrated until it’s hers and Peles turn to jump from the cliff.

While I overall definitely enjoyed the film, I feel that Aster's subversion to display all the horror undercut the overall horrific aspects of the film. Why not show all the kids getting killed? Why not show more insight into the rituals and whatnot rather than  some overly-long shots of ritual setups?

This film was extremely beautiful and did wonders of crafting a story. Am I wrong thinking that the ‘attention seeking’ of bipolar individuals is exactly what Dani thrives in as the film closes?

She is very much manic and when she is happiest she is being viewed as the main attention in the community. Even when she has a screaming panic attack she is surrounded with others screaming with her in a form of sharing pain. Is it a metaphor of the way people are viewed with serious trauma and disorders as only seeking attention, when all they want is to share their grief and are misunderstood?

The bit at the table I noticed his drink colour being different immediately and thought it was so weird until he got the hair. That was done really well.

I also find all the discussion about Dani and Christian so weird, with people taking sides on who is worse. They both sucked. Christian was a terrible boyfriend, but he was 100% staying with her because he felt bad for her. She was a emotional leech, and it's so draining being with someone like that (her reasons were sad, even before the death, but she knew she was leaning on him way too hard). The way she knew exactly how many years and weeks they had been together when it was 4 years was not normal behaviour. The way he would just cut her off talking or dismiss her, or when he wasn't cheering for her when everyone else was during the dance when she was finally having a good time was also not normal behaviour.

It was quite funny in some parts (I’m not sure if it was trying to be) so I’ll give it that. But not scary and downright boring for the majority.

Not once during the film was I ever the edge of my seat nervous about what was going to happen; I didn’t walk out of the theater with lingering unease. 

Granted that doesn’t happen with a lot of horror movies, so when it doesn’t, I’m looking for them to be fun. Maybe that’s not the right word? Enjoyable?

I’m not looking to go see a movie to be uncomfortable for two hours. I’m looking to have my adrenaline pumping. That’s why I love a good jump scare, and I love Slashers. 

I know some people will ask, how is it being uncomfortable and being horrified by what your seeing are not the same thing? And my answer is they don’t trigger that same part of my brain. They don’t scratch the same itch. 

I get why people love these movies. I do. I understand the horror that can be found in incredibly bleak and brutal situations. But for me, I just feel miserable for the length. 

And it’s not because there’s no happy-ish ending. My favorite horror movie is Ju-on. And that’s a film that’s about as bleak as you can get. But it’s creative in its storytelling, it uses jump scares well, and most of all you don’t feel that overwhelming sense of hopelessness until the very end.

esncpig,"I’m really looking forward to reading the interpretations of this movie. I really think this was Ari Aster’s condensed interpretation of religion in general and the important thing is that it wasn’t advocating or attacking, it was just an honest point of view. You can choose to ignore the horrors and see them as necessary steps toward saving a person and creating an ongoing peaceful community, one that firmly believes what they are doing is *right* and *helps* others. Or, you can see these people as manipulators taking advantage of people in various levels of vulnerability to continue their own facade of choice and faith. 

The cult used, manipulated and murdered people to further cement their own beliefs. None of these people were actually given much choice, just lead to believe they were. They all wanted to leave but couldn’t. Also, they happened to be intellectuals trying to keep an open mind, people that would have been the pied pipers to tell the world the facts of what was happening there but they were either silenced through death or joining. Overtime the overall goal works out. 

On a technical level I thought this movie was amazing and one hell of a second effort from a director who’s career I cannot wait to watch. Even being in familiar subject matter (inevitable wicker man comparisons), it still felt like its own thing with a unique voice. The score was beautiful and I loved how a lot of it had a practical source through the also amazing production design. The camera work here could have told the story on its own, without sound. Then the attention to detail, the little bits I started noticing in the background that made me excited to watch it again already. It wasn’t what I expected and was really dark-funny in a lot of way. I’m a fan. 

**Edit:** Speaking on the details, something that just popped into my head... when they saw the bear in the cage and Will Poulter had a line like “are we just going to ignore the bear?” then that thought was interrupted by a tapestry coming into the foreground. On the tapestry was a story of a girl cutting her clitoris and putting the blood into a special drink, giving the drink to a man, then her and the man having a special union. Christian was pressured to drink an unknown drink after being told he was meant to be a partner with the red headed woman which lead to their union while other elders chanted the act on, helping it along. Likely because she was scare and weak after cutting her clitoris for the drink they gave him. Pretty sure this was told to us from the tapestry and, of course, the fact that his dick was bloody when he ran out of the ceremony.",c7y18a

The relationship between the main characters was shown to be toxic, not once, not twice, but multiple times. It got to the point where I was thinking, “We get it. She’s codependent, and he’s a shit person and a shit boyfriend.” It would have been nice if they left that a little subtle, but it started feeling like a caricature of a real relationship. I wish the movie didn’t feel the need to spell that out to death. The characters, in general, were so unlikable. I was hoping everyone but the main character would die brutally. 

I get that the main character is codependent and she adopted the cult as her family at the end, and she finally feels held, but I don’t think it’s as deep as people are making it out to be. It’s very straightforward what happened. I keep seeing comments like, “what the fuck was the ending holy shit” and “that ending was mind blowing, no idea what happened,” but it’s pretty straightforward.

It was funny at parts, and really beautifully shot, but ultimately there wasn't really anything that kept me invested through the movie's long run time. 

In Hereditary and Suspiria which I would compare favorably to this, there was this overriding anxiety and fear of incoming calamity. You weren't sure what would happen and you really felt emotions from the characters.

In Midsommar...I felt her grief filled breakdowns in the beginning and I literally covered my mouth in shock at the revelation of what happened to her family, but then the movie goes on for 2 hours with just some laughs to keep you going. Theres no terror filled atmosphere. Maybe the general set up of the movie makes whats going to happen too obvious but characters being sacrificed when they go to a crazy cult's festival is so extremely old hat by now that I was never shocked or really interested in what was happening.

I'm kinda sad I didn't like it. This is the type of movie I really like, but I just didn't get much out of this. Great first act, then it goes on forever with nothing to keep you interested.",c7y18a

1. Did we ever see what happened to Simon and Connie? I assumed both were just killed but idk if their bodies were a part of the rituals or something. My friend thought they were actually allowed to leave though.
2. If you watch the official trailer from this movie, there are some scenes that were in the trailer missing from this movie. Mostly in the night, looks like another ritual with someone's feet rising. Would've loved to see this in the movie.

Extremely unnerving experience with a 3rd act that threw me off, but it's a great movie. Can't wait for more from Ari Aster.",c7y18a

eswenal,"This movie was so great, but I think it also maybe shouldn’t be in theaters - because general audiences are just the worst people to see it with. Like when I saw Hereditary, there were some kids who were bored, but ultimately respectful of other people. This went to another level where some jackass in my theater was *actively* voicing his displeasure with how the movie was boring and confusing him, full volume - like he thought he was voicing everyone’s opinion (like “this is shit amirite??” stuff). And I was so enthralled with the film, that I didn’t want to take 20 minutes out of it to go get a manager and make a scene (because there was no way this guy and his friend were leaving quietly). So the next best option was to leave halfway - exchange my ticket for the next show, and just pick up there.

This movie was so good that I essentially watched it 1.5 times and it *never* felt it’s length.

I’m probably going to be thinking of that scene with the handful of girls sympathetically mimicking Florence Pugh’s panic attack for awhile.",c7y18a

&#x200B;

My overall thoughts on the movie was that it wasn't as good as hereditary to me. But that is because I cannot compare it with Hereditary as they seem to be very different types ish of movies (where hereditary led to a very direct ending and Midsommar had a very open-ended ish ending).

I don't usually mind horror, a film like Saw is fine by me -- kinda cheesey about a laughable villain punishing steoreotypical characters to ""help them."" This movie was **not** that.

The problem is that the protagonists in this movie were all likable. It's basically **The Hangover** and then they all get violently tortured to death for being normal healthy good people (unlike in Saw where they have kitschy character flaws). I watch this movie and feel icked out, and I ask what message I received that justified this ick... and I can't find one. The closest thing to a point in this whole movie is ""But we put our old people in retirement homes"" (which is a weak analogy for the cliff thing at most).

It also really disgusts me that people seem *okay* with this Chris-Pratt-Knockoff getting raped and decapitated for being a bad boyfriend...? Like I get it, he doesn't love his girlfriend anymore and should have ended it, but was afraid to because her family died. That's nicer than just dumping her or not inviting her on the trip. Or, consider this, she could have left him if having her birthday forgotten was such a trauma?

To summarize - if the director was trying to make me feel absolutely disgusted by the thought of a crazy cult that senselessly murders college students then he succeeded at that... but why did I pay to feel disgusted? What was the grand truth that needed such severity to be articulated?

Or worse, if the director thought I'd be hoping to see people have their lungs yanked out their backs because they peed on a tree, then clearly he has a very different brain than I do...",c7y18a
esob9o5,"So I can’t see the movie until next week since I’m out of town. I read the screenplay a while ago and actually **really** loved it. My thing though is that I’m not a horror person at all, I’m super squeamish and don’t like to see movies I’m not prepared for (the only reason I read the screenplay for this one in the first place was curiosity, since the bright sunny setting seems awesome for a horror movie), so I have some questions for y’all who have seen it:


Are there any major departures from the screenplay or is it mostly along the same lines? I’m going to assume from the trailers that Reuben is the deformed kid and doesn’t just have cerebral palsy.


Most of the horror was like slow burn or whatever so I’m prepared for when it starts going off the rails of course, but I do remember there being a smash cut in the script that described going to a close-up shot of >!one of the dead elders that jumped off the cliff. Is this still in the movie? And if so, when is it? (so I can prepare myself)!< Are there any other smash cuts to nasty imagery? I’m totally prepared for the >!chicken coop scene and the part with the guy wearing the other one’s skin + the bodies getting wheelbarrowed to the burning ritual.!<


I remember there being a lot of vomiting in the script: >!When we see the sister’s body, I think while Dani is tripping after they arrive and the runs off to the woods, during the maypole dance/running thing when one lady gets too dizzy/plastered, when Dani gets out of the carriage and looks in on the sex scene, Christian after the sex scene after he sees Dani’s vomit…!< So if anyone can tell me those are the only times it happens, that would be great. I read a lot of reactions from people who read the script afterwards being like ‘oh that was so disturbing, it made my skin crawl’ and me, the biggest scaredy cat bitch in the room, has just been like “well that was an enjoyable romp but I didn’t like how much he mentioned characters vomiting” since I read it.

Girlfriend and I saw this last week and its been in my head for days. Not as good as *Hereditary* but shows that Aster is a definite talent. The last 40 minutes of this felt like I was on a flower covered tilt-a-whirl and that paralyzing feeling I got from *Hereditary*'s climax was there in full force. Would really like to give this another go, but save the Extended Cut for another time unless I feel differently. If Aster wants to show how much he loves *Dogville* with that thing, then let him have I suppose.

Oh and about me seeing this with my girlfriend (first date movie, hooray!), she was completely unaffected but genuinely engaged with it. We even did a video on it together and at one point, I ask her if she wants to see *Hereditary* and she says ""Maybe"". On the flipside, I was clinging on to dear life during the climax lmao.

etajult,"Random thoughts:

* Is it just me or did the ""drawing"" that was shown for the opening 5 seconds of the film tell us the entire story?
* What was the prescription medication Dani took early in the film?
* Is it possible Dani herself is mentally ill? Bipolar tends to be genetic, and siblings are at a higher risk, or so I've read.
* Bearing that in mind, is it possible *The Guardian*'s review is on point, and the events of the film are Dani's 'shroom hallucination? The guys act so damn stupid, it almost seems like their behavior is being interpreted by a mentally ill person--which Dani may be.
* I find it funny that this film can be seen as both an affirmation and repudiation of feminism. In 25 years, I predict Red Pillers and 4th wave feminists will be pointing to it, and drawing vastly different conclusions about its message. I love it!
* Also, when Christian was completely paralyzed by that drug and Dani was looking at him, thinking about who to select for the ritual sacrifice, I've never seen a more *perfect* portray of a ""pleading"" look in someone's eyes as I did in his. Pure genius acting.
* Last but not least, when the main characters first reach the village and Pelle introduces them to his Uncle(?), one of the ""returning villager extras"" in the background was a blonde chick with pigtails wearing red striped shorts. Was I the only one hypnotized by her ***beautiful*** butt? Keep an eye out for her if you give it another viewing and get back to me. 😉",c7y18a

esnnthq,"Here are my thoughts:  

Pros:  The tone. I really liked the overall world and way everything was protrayed as bright and sunny. It added to the horror

The Humor:  The audience I was in seemed to get that some of the hard core stuff had a hint of dark humor and loved it.  It really made you appreciate the line between humor and horror and it was great. 

The Story: Overall I just really liked it. 

The characters: Other than a few things, I really liked following these guys around and seeing how they interacted with the story. 

Christian: He was the worst and got what he deserved. 

&#x200B;

Cons: I know some people like it but the way he thinks all crying involves screaming at the top of your lungs is too much for me. He did it in Hereditary too and after a while it just becomes annoying to me.  That's really it. 

&#x200B;

Overall I really enjoyed it and I think one of the themes was people having the courage to move on or make a choice.  From Dani and Christian, both stuck in the same place because they didnt' want to have the courage to make a change and end up in a relationship that they both hate. A lot of characters just accepted things without really pushing like Josh just letting Christian hog into his thesis. He never put his foot down, none of the characters did and especially Christian. He was like the poster boy for coward so him being spotlighted in the building at the end really signified the dangers of being scared to move. 

&#x200B;

That's also why I think Dani was given a choice who to pick. She had to finally make a move and then she ends up happy, at least in her own way. What do you guys think?",c7y18a
evayr8s,"I just watched and I have to say it is the only movie in my life I could not finish in the theater and had to walk away. Thought it was around 2 hours long but then I realized it is two and a half hours long and that I still can  save 30 minutes of my life. That does not come from a guy who values his time very highly, mind you.

I'm not super into horror movies But I'd watched most of the classic horror movies, and usually a horror move relies on 3 pillars: 1)jumpscares 2)gore and 3)suspense. If the combination is right you get a masterpiece like ""The Thing"" or ""Alien"" some movies rely extensively or exclusively on one of the pillars at that not a bad thing either if done right. 

This film however somehow manages to have almost none of the  pillars except >!the brief (and relatively well done)  gore scenes in the middle (and to my my understanding in the end of the movie
there are no jump scares and the only suspense I've got was wherever I fall asleep before the movie ends or not.   !<

Again I could not finish the move in the theater but I've read wikipedia now and the only twist I have not foreseen is >!the last one!<, and I'm not super bright or anything. Very predictable, very slow.

Now  when I've read how the movie ends on wikipedia I think that the movie might be a tale about how >!relationships that are  clearly not working out have to be cut short **sooner** rather then later!< in this case it is actually a brilliant movie. If I watched the ending myself my blood would've burned with rage

But if it is true than I swear it the weirdest and the most dragged out way to deliver the point anybody have ever found. Kinda brilliant in this case though. Not a horror movie however.

Seems like it is possible he could have manipulated the events somehow that isn’t obvious on first view.

Getting her to go to Sweden 2.leaving her with no connections or reasons to return after surviving the ordeal.,c7y18a

But then again... it seems sort of weird to call this a horror.  If i was to compare it to Hereditary tho.... I'd say I liked Hereditary more. Midsommar is a pretty slow movie and I'd prob find it boring if I were to rewatch it considering the first viewing alone you already kind of somehow know how the movie turn out. Im left soft of wondering if the movie was terribly written or scenes cut or unthought of. There is a bunch of stuff that just kind of goes nowhere/absent. The final scene of the burning of the bodies in the sacred temple... it looked soooooo off/unrealistic how easily one or two of the bodies were moved around like they were deflated rubber balloons. Also what was up with the scissors being put under the baby's crib? I also thought some scenes were ""funny"" at the wrong time. For a movie like this some scenes just didn't need jokes. It sort of takes the tension the film is building away if that makes any sense.

esq7m9g,"TLDR: Go see it if you liked hereditary. 8/10.

Ari Aster is quickly establishing himself as one of my favourite directors. Midsommar is similar to Hereditary in both style and story, which is by no means a bad thing. Every shot in this film is beautiful, colourful and enticing - you are made part of the scene, experiencing the weird yet gorgeous world of an isolated cult. It is a slow burner, and at times I could feel myself waiting for something to happen but it has a satisfying payoff, especially if you pay attention to all the hints Aster drops throughout the film. The acting is good (bar the English actors, who I found annoying during their brief appearance), with the Swedes all being convincing crazies, and Florence Pugh shines as a troubled and lost young lady. There are generous servings of gore and full, prolonged nudity, but no jump-scares which is my preference anyway.

Overall this is a smart, slick and creepy addition to the 'Folk Horror' genre, and I wholeheartedly recommend it, although I can see why it may not be to everyone's taste. I want to see more Pagans and cults from Aster - he has already made it (in my eyes at least) as an esteemed Director.",c7y18a

Midsommar 2019

★★★★★ Watched 03 Jul, 2019

I had been looking forward to this film for a long time, and it definitely lived up to my expectations.

Midsommar is extremely unsettling and visually enchanting. Cinematically this movie is a masterpiece. Top notch cinematography, sound design, editing.

I have some small nitpicks, I wasn't a huge fan of the comedy coming from the Mark character, the pacing feels a bit off, and some of the characters weren't very fleshed out/well written/acted. The movie is so beautiful to look at and so weird and disturbing that I can't give it any less than 5 stars though.

I wouldn't say this is strictly a horror film. More of a blend of arthouse drama, horror, and comedy. It feels like a disturbing fairy tale for adults.

The acting wasn't amazing all around, but no one was distractingly bad, and Florence Pugh was seriously amazing.

So overall I loved it. A visual masterpiece with great cinematography, tons of interesting and unsettling imagery, superb sound design, and plenty of WTF moments. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, but if you're into weird and messed up or visually appealing movies you'll probably love it too.",c7y18a
esrbru2,"So I read the script when it initially leaked and I really liked it a lot; it made me really eager to see the film and as I recognized things from the trailer that became even more so. I think the translation from script to screen didn't work for me. Scenes that played out such as the mass hysteria where members of the cult ""feel"" what other characters are feeling when I initially read them gave me an uncanny feeling. 

What comes to mind is in Annihilation. So as to not spoil I'll just say there's a scene where a character's movements are mimicked and for me it was totally unnerving. Watching Midsommar's scenes however came across as silly though, particularly with several groups of people in the theater laughing at the scene. 

I tried to figure out why and I just came to the conclusion that the sound of Dani crying, when mimicked and amplified, turned it from emotional to hysterical hysteria. 

To illustrate to my brother (who I saw the film with) what I was talking about I used the [Duck Army](https://youtu.be/nHc288IPFzk) video as an example. Just the duck by itself, yeah okay it makes a noise. But amplified like that it becomes absurdly funny. That's how those scenes went for me.

To me it seemed like Dani felt out of place, having lost her family and all. It seemed like her character arc revolved around losing her sense of place within the world, with her shitty relationship with Christian not helping at all. The film doesn't establish her feeling this way at all, but give a lot of instances of her feeling at home with the cult (Randomly learning to speak Swedish, them all screaming together in the multi-bedroom, etc).  If they had taken more time to flesh out this detail, rather than try and develop the characters whose only purpose was to die anyway, then I would've loved this film.

Okay so if you prepare for some time knowing that you and your spouse are going to jump together in a ritualistic suicide you’d think you’d do it right (not pencil dive)

The film makes a point to show how ritualistic the hammer head smashing for the not quite dead is. All 3 (or 4?) come out and take a blow on the guy, and the last hit is superficial. This is as if it was important that they all administer a blow, regardless of the actual necessity.

In the end the film, two of the 9 sacrifices sent/brought into the yellow house to burn are told to “take from the yew tree” in order to feel no pain or fear, whereas Christian is specifically ignored for the gesture of mercy.

It seems like there is some deliberateness with who will suffer and who will not in the film, so perhaps the pencil dive in contrast with the belly flop was intentional in some manner? Was he supposed to suffer?

Of course, it would also make sense that overcoming the jump is difficult enough that so many people f’d it up therefor they had a well weathered head smashing hammer. But damn...",c7y18a

UPDATE:

Alright ... so I enjoyed Hereditary more from a storytelling perspective. I'm a film school graduate who concentrated in screenwriting, so I'm always a lot more invested in character development and how well the plot flows versus focusing on the visuals, score, etc. But Midsommar is a sonic and visual treat. I personally had a horrible first experience with pot, and Dani's meltdown when they first arrived really bothered me A LOT. It hit too close to home, but it made me appreciate the film's ability to make me resonate with her character. 

The film is madly beautiful — even the gory scenes were pretty to me. As an avid horror fan, I'm very much desensitized to the bloody stuff, so I was let down by some of the other posters who made the film seem over the top with the gore. It was more unsettling and bizarre — not really gross. 

Story was definitely lacking, but I think Pugh fucking killed her role as Dani. She's going to do just fine in Hollywood. That chanting/crying scene was so cathartic, and I almost teared up a bit. She went through so much hell throughout the film, and by the end you could tell she just lost all fucks to give. The drugs probably helped a lot, too. The other characters were meaningless to me, sentiments a lot of other viewers seem to share. I thought the lot of em were likable in different ways, but I couldn't have cared less when they were picked off. 

This is a good break up story, though. I enjoyed Dani's arc and the symbolism in realizing she is a Queen who don't need no man. The sequence when she was crowned the May Queen was also an emotional one for me. When she first realized she made it to the final 8 — her happiness and surprise at how well she had done was not only cute but it made me relate to her a lot as someone who's not entirely confident and underestimates their abilities. It just sucked to see Christian's ass sitting there and not even trying to cheer her on or anything. Jerk. Nice foreshadowing with that painting above her bed, too ;)

I love mythicism a lot, and I would've liked to learn more about the cult. But's it's obvious they just recycle ancient traditions and their current ideologies are bull crap since the inbred kid basically fingerpaints them into existence.

We thought we were being pranked. The pacing is insane. I felt like he was deliberately trying to make it as boring as possible.

it was suspenseful in a way I liked, especially for a slow paced movie. I liked it more than Hereditary, but the story was so underdeveloped and the characters were so boring. 

I didn't like that they demonized Christian, since Dani was just as selfish and yes Christian screwed up at the mating ritual, but I felt Dani was just as selfish.

The film relied too much on ""thinking"" scenes, rather than ""speaking"" scenes. There were so many scenes where the characters decide to be passive aggressive and rather than have cool dialogue, they just sit in silence and give a pouty face.

I liked the drug themes. It really felt accurate to the psychedelic usage and the slow passage of time complemented this theme.

I liked the portrayal of the cult and how they eventually got caught up in it. This is accurate because usually cults aren't aggressive (at least not initially) when recruiting members or luring them in. Eventually, they start to manipulate and put doubt and offer sympathy and love when potential members are vulnerable.",c7y18a

 This could open possibilities of Pelle knowing Dani MUST go on that trip, why Dani was made May Queen, understood Swedish (for a short second), and why Dani saw her mom in Sweden.

The sister  and parents were murdered to eventually lead to at the very least boyfriend and optimistically Dani going to the Midsommar festival. Her age also fits, according to the cult's definition of ages her birthday is at the beginning of the festival and she's in the middle of the ""summer"" period of her life.   
   

Remember both Recruiter and his brother brought women they were interested in to the festival, it just turned out Recruiter was better and his girl(Dani) was ""chosen"" whilst his brother's choice ended up freaking out and trying to leave.

The relationship between Dani and Christian was painful to watch because of that codependency, and even the small hints towards Dani's sister showed it ran in the family the desire to lean on someone else. In the end, Dani got something she **did** really want; a extremely empathetic family! (To replace the one she lost of course)

 During the film, I noticed how there were so many scenes that involved reflections, mirrors, etc. I didn't understand it at first, I thought maybe it represented the different perspectives of the couple and how they see things, looking into the other but having something in the way. An obstacle. But I love the idea that mirroring represents empathizing and comfort, that makes a lot of sense with different scenes and other reoccurring things in the film.

- Dani seeing her sister in the mirror, but she’s tripping and its not really there.

- When Josh sees Mark in the reflection when taking photos of the book, but its not really him.

I like that you mention reflections as another symbolic quality to the mirrors. Many times in the same shot, what’s being shown on camera and what’s being shown as reflected are never on the same page, and it strengthens that disconnected theme by showing that relationship visually to the audience. 

It’s crazy but that could also greater strengthen the empathy and positive reflection and mirroring the Harga women do to Dani when she’s having her full on breakdown/panic attack. By having distorted reflections and mirroring be a common theme throughout the film, when we finally see that good mirroring we sympathize even more with Dani, all thanks to those blood savvy, pale lunatics.",c7y18a

Edit: Someone asked me to clarify this in another comment: 
Edit2: clarified some points after my second viewing. 

From a story perspective, it was a slow burn. I viewed one angle of this film as Dani’s struggle to cope and heal with her tragedy. She lost everything (her family). A common re-occurring theme was isolation:

1. traveling to a foreign country
2. the other friends did not want Dani on the trip
3. the other couple’s fiancé ”going to the train station” leaving the other girl alone
4. Many of the main characters are in PhD programs. For anyone who has done this, it is an incredibly isolating process
5. Even the two guys were fighting over their thesis topics. One was struggling to share (he died). The other willing to share and collaborate (he survived a bit longer). 

The film explored how isolation leaves individuals very vulnerable. 

6. when all of the American characters were alone they got chopped off one-by-one,

7. This isolation was also demonstrated by her sister struggling with bipolar disorder in the opening. And even wanting to take the parents with her (in the suicide). 

8. Even Dani is shown in the beginning taking Ativan (Lorazepam), which is an antidepressant /anxiety medication. Depression and anxiety are very isolating themselves. She struggles and just wants to talk to her boyfriend (about Sweden, her tragic loss by calling etc).

9. Even many of the characters share drugs, and the film takes time to highlight this (mushrooms, sleeping pills, etc.) 

This cult acted as a way for her to heal by providing family/friends and eliminated her isolation (demonstrated when they mimicked her crying, the screaming at the end, etc).",c7y18a
esnfdui,"I’m glad someone else thinks so! I thought that scene was so beautiful and moving and completely non-creepy. Obviously it’s weird and people in our culture don’t really act like that, but what else is love besides sitting there and willingly stepping into feeling someone else’s pain in such a visceral and raw way? Dani even tries to run away from them and isolate, but they pull her back and force her to express her emotions and they mirror them right back, saying “we will feel this with you.” So cool, and a moment that resonated with me within a lot of hilarious weirdness in this movie lol",c7y18a
esn6t52,The village community was very empathetic or at least tried to be,c7y18a

esqirt6,"Further, it is about technology ripping these things from us. The movie starts with the two sisters disconnected and not talking, but emailing eachother. They both feel alone in their feelings. The commune is ultimately happier because they share their feelings. Dani experiences death at both ends, but feels happier, and at peace, experiencing it in a deeply weaved community where everyone feels eachothers grief, happiness, and emotion. 

Nobody in the commune can retreat to selfish singular feelings within their phone. Christian early on is pissed that his phone has no connection to the outside within the commune.",c7y18a
f2chrs9,"That scene where all the women cry with her packed a huge emotional punch for me. Disturbing at first, then just beautiful.

espi1bg,"But she didn't share her grief with anyone! She got swept up in a cult! Rituals, ceremonies, traditions -- it's all arbitrary and meaningless, particularly when you're effectively being forced to participate via brainwashing and drugs.

If anything, she found a way to escape her grief by leaning into the nonsensical, farcical rituals of the cult. Instead of dealing with her grief, instead of building relationships that would allow her to heal, she won a dance contest, wore a crown of flowers, and watched a barn full of mutilated people burn down.",c7y18a
esnjcvn,"While I agree with this, I saw it as more focused on the relationship of the two main characters.  I'm sure someone could add onto this, but the story finishing with the man cheating on the woman and the woman finally being done with the relationship.

f2iwp3a,"I felt a kind of cognitive dissonance during the movie because the cult was so obviously terrible and if I were in that situation I'd be hightailing it outta there but at the same time every time they did something supportive like running in a flock to support Dani in her grief I'd be like ""awww that's sweet""",c7y18a

etcts6d,"Yeah that's the main thing I could think of when trying to work out the ending. I assumed she started smiling at the end because her new ""family"" were all crying out in pain in a similar way to how she had been.

Pelle didn't tell his friends that the 2 elders would commit suicide in front of everyone. He acts like he's sorry and that was a mistake but by the end you realize that was on purpose to affect the group and Dani eapecially even more.",c7y18a
esrblup,Hereditary is easier to swallow and easier (for me) to recommend to others whereas Midsommar for me was... strange. I don’t know. I feel weird about it. Like I loved it but at the same time like it shouldn’t exist? Like it’s not something I should’ve seen. Ari Aster truly knows how to fuck people up. I pretty much just sat stunned in silence as the credits for Midsommar rolled. No idea what to say or think. Just silent.,c7y18a

When I saw a face in the trees I gasped so loud because I wasn’t sure if that was what I really saw so thank you for confirming. I’m sure I’m stating the obvious but I felt there was a big theme of being one with nature in this movie (eg. Grass merging with skin) so that would make sense.,c7y18a

Earlier in the movie Pelle said that his parents burnt up in a fire which I think was them sacrificing themselves in a fire. If that is true then there is no way it happens every 90 years but if it is true then their population would be destroyed.

I loved the movie btw",c7y18a

et9p2tt,"I know this is contended, but I don't think so. 

I think Pelle stretched the truth and lied about certain things. Obviously, his real motive was to get Dani to the festival and make her May Queen. 

I think the significance of the number 9 tells us that the 90 years is true. I think they have a midsommer festival every year, hence the May Queens, but the sacrifice and scale is not required until the 90th year. 

I could be wrong, this is my take.",c7y18a

esv9fx8,[deleted],c7y18a
etyj94c,"Really late on this comment, but my interpretation was a lot of the noise mimicking was done just to drown out the original noise. When the guy breaks his legs for example, if everyone just sat around listening to the guy screaming in pain people might start to see the ritual as horrifying and be dissuaded from making the jump themselves when it's their turn, and it would just in general bring down the whole celebratory vibe the village was trying to go for with it, so they make part of the ritual involve everyone making pained screams themselves so that nobody can hear the cries injured guy might be making (and if they do it would be indistinguishable from all the others). And the same goes for the fire at the end, nobody wants to hear their friends/relatives scream as they're burning alive so as part of the custom they all just scream too, to drown it out and keep the ritual's mood lighter and more game-y.",c7y18a
esnql08,"This is biggest thing I'm grappling with right now.

esnfay9,"The communal expression of emotions isn't exclusive to hidden nature cults, but a fundamental aspect of many cultures. I think it can be hard to relate coming from a very individualistic society, like myself, but I think this film did a good job of at least introducing western viewers to the practice.

You have the person who laughs, the person who gets technical and information heavy, the person who is apprehensive, the person who uses activities to distract, and the person who just outright ignores it. This movie to me puts forth the notion that the only true way to get over grief is with a community that understands you and to confront it outright instead of pretending you are strong. It's only when we let our guards down with getting rid of the other methods and embrace the situation with people is when we are truly happy.",c7y18a

Yes",c7y18a
esonxx3,">The lack of empathy we give others when they need it most?

Also how empathy and sympathy differ in a committed relationship. Christian is mostly sympathetic towards Dani's loss, but it's reactive to when she's most upset and he's always distant. He's not empathizing with her and trying to understand, he's showing her sympathy and assuming she will rise to his level (i.e. taking the mushrooms with everyone). 

Meanwhile, Pelle is constantly showing how much he empathizes with Dani by talking about his own parents. The family even screams & cries with Dani after she becomes May Queen, and uses drugs to manipulate the emotions of outsiders. 

In this way, the Harga ""breaking"" Christian & Dani's relationship for their own gains felt very similar to the way the demon ""broke"" the family in Hereditary in order to possess the son.",c7y18a

At some point it becomes clear that it’s just shocking for the sake of it, without resolving any emotional threads.

The fact that Dani had no family \*left\* made her  most vulnerable to the cult.  The only connection she had to the person she was before the tragedy  was a boyfriend who didn't want to be there.

eucg7qp,"So I just watched it (why this is a bit late) and have an absolutely wildly different interpretation of the movie. Easiest way to put it is you know them two elders who jumped off the cliff? I think that's what Pelle and Dani are supposed to become. Here are some more odd points I thought of. 

In her room artwork caught my eye of like moon positions in a circle, when they arrived and people were sitting on a stage it resembled that.

Them two people were said to be reborn into a baby upon their deaths, and I found the lady to look a lot like an aged Florence Pugh.

The description of the oracle being a product of selective inbreeding? Dani's BF and Maya were the only two redheads there. 

We got an odd close-up of a pill bottle in the beginning that didn't lead to anything else. 

She started having trouble sleeping before they went to Sweden, but in time for the event of a constant sun cycle. 

Pelle explained people during their spring years go on 'pilgrimage', she became the May queen. 

She thought she saw her mum, which easily could have been a trip, but might not have been. 

She was greeted with a 'welcome home' 

During the dance sequence it seemed her and the other lady could start understanding each other in a language thst wasn't English. 

Every other May queen looked similar to her. 

Basically as wild as this is, she was a baby born of a sacrifice like with the two elders, found herself in America, her BF couldn't break up with her despite wanting to because their fate (bearing in mind this follows Heridtary, where it seemed the boys fate was to become a new Demon).

It seemed like Pelle and his brother/friend both invited girls they were interested in mating with as well as their men who could be outsiders and potential mates for the cult women as well as sacrifices. But because there can only be one May Queen, it was kind of a gamble which girl would be the new member and which one would be the sacrifice.",c7y18a
esnyzh9,I’m so dumb I didn’t even realize that was her screaming.,c7y18a
esocum5,"In the screenplay, there are more incidents where Connie and Simon are being “disrespectful” to the cult. Ari noted that they were all eating meat throughout the festival, but at one point the cult members sacrifice some animals in front of everyone, including a dog. This causes Simon to get super angry and argue with a few of them, but they point out to him that he’s being a hypocrite if he doesn’t have a problem eating animals but he doesn’t feel comfortable watching them die. That’s when they decide to leave.",c7y18a
esotdgw,"So I have a theory on this-

I think Connie was initially destined to be the May Queen. It's pretty obvious that the cult had set it up for Dani to become the May Queen, but she was initially not supposed to be coming along on the trip.

Pelle's brother brought Connie and Simon, and had Connie not come we would have seen the story play out with Simon and Connie in the lead roles.

And I don’t quite remember other specific incidences, but I feel like I remember other moments before the sex scene where she has a similar combined reaction of wonder and then horror. The sex scene is really when she gets over the hill, so to speak. She is absolutely gutted and devastated in every possible way, but once she has the support of the other girls, she is much better. Then look at her when she sentences Christian to death.

There is a very interesting and relevant Greek myth involving aster flowers. Every nine years, seven brave boys and seven beautiful girls were sent from Athens to Crete as sacrifices to appease a Minotaur's appetite. Theseus volunteered as tribute to defeat it or negotiate with it once he got there. He told his father, the King Aegeus, that if he survived, he would change out his black sail for a white one, but he forgot (oops). When his father saw his son's ship returning with a black sail, he was so grief-stricken he committed suicide by throwing himself off a cliff.

et38lrj,"I've read the screenplay so I can give some insight. Apparently, there were a ton of scenes filmed that were cut. The original run time was over 3 hours. 

>Dani in a group of Harga at night saying ""What's happening?""

So there is another ritual that happens at night by a river. They dress up a log in jewels and greenery and offer it to the river. That is also what Connie is dressed in at the end and why her body is waterlogged - she was sacrificed similarly to the tree. Anyway, this ceremony is is after the Attestupan ceremony (where elders jump from the cliffs and die). After the log is thrown into the water as an offering Siv (the priestess lady) implies the river is not satisfied with only that sacrifice and is still gurgling so it sounds ""still hungry"" and asks for volunteers for an offering. A little boy offers himself as a volunteer and comes forward all dressed up like the log was in greenery and jewels. And I imagine at this point the audience would be freaking out thinking they are about to watch a little boy drown because we established that the movie is willing to go there with the previous Attestupan scene. 

Dani asks ""what's happening"" and starts to protest louder and louder but then the tension breaks as more of the Harga also protest the little boy being offered saying he ""showed his bravery."" As it is written in the screenplay, the Harga protest sounds rehearsed - as though none of them were stressed because they all knew the boy would never be drowned and this was part of the ritual all along. 

>Dani arguing with Christian at night saying ""I don't wanna acclimate, I wanna go.""

This is immediately after the water log/little boy ritual and is the original scene where Christian tells Dani he will be doing his theses on the Harga and that is why they have to stay. 

>Camera shot of someone's feet as they begin to levitate off the ground

Those are Christian's feet. He isn't really levitating - it's just his perception because he is tripping. He feels like he levitates over to Maja before their sexual ceremony begins. You can tell it is that scene because you can see someone else's feet in the background and they are holding the dressing gown he was wearing before disrobing.",c7y18a
et2g4kd,"Kinda glad about that last one, to be honest. One of my favorite aspects of this movie was that the events themselves were all relatively grounded in reality and entirely possible. Even the trips didn’t really require you to suspend your disbelief.

et4i39f,"My biggest issue is I know the film was trying to paint itself that way, but I never got why they do it and that made everything they're doing dumb to me.

There was never a moment in the film where I thought what they were doing was to achieve an actual goal. 

I wish there was a single moment in the movie that made me think that what they were doing was necessary, instead it just felt superfluous. 

If this whole ordeal was actually necessary to give them a bountiful harvest or to truly help the thriving of their community I'd think that was better. But I didn't and more importantly I don't know if I think the village believed it. 

Regardless of how the ideologies are supposed to be executed and how the rituals are performed there are a few moments that made me think that the villagers must know this is bullshit. 

The very end of the movie when the guy took the yew for the pain and then burned to death horribly would have surely rang bells in villagers heads that some of their shit doesn't work or that the elders are lying to them.

Then the sex scene had the girl reach out and it seemed like she didn't even want to do it or be there having sex with that guy. 

I think if we are really to believe that this is something they do every (or every 90) years, that there would be a stronger feeling of something at play here.

One of the things that frustrated me for the first half of the film was intention and perspective. I wanted an honest, unbiased look at this culture and what they were going to do without the implementations of poor judgement from the outsiders. 

I feel like it was too typical Foreign American slasher (Turisas, Hostel, etc.) for me to appreciate the actual nuance at play in the village. So when Mark pissed on the tree and Chidi broke into their sacret place, I was pissed because I had to wait for the movie to end to see if those things would have happened regardless.

So that's how the movie ultimately sat with me, it felt too illogical outside of the theme.
They knew all along that they had to bring 4 outsiders to die.
The four outsiders need to die in order to be a part of the midsomar ritual.
The midsomar ritual is supposed to bring a good harvest (?)
There is nothing that indicates that it works. This is further backed up by some of their medicine and rituals not working or it's followed by them taking liberties with out the rituals are supposed to be performed in order to fit the proper sequencing (stuffing him in the bear, the bear was captured and not hunted down, what was the original purpose of this ritual?)
If I am viewing this as my first midsomar, is it ever a thought in the villagers minds that it is unnecessary?

It sounds cliche and it definitely would have followed suit with the other conventional cult thrillers to have that moment of justification (Ninth Gate, Rosemary's Baby, hell even Hereditary.) I really wanted to have that moment where I believed along with the villagers, instead it just felt like they didn't think about it at all and that made me think the ritual was stupid. 

Note, I was completely on board with the runic alphabet and the seasonal age cycles and all that, but I just really wished they showed us why that was actually important. It's not like something good comes out of it, they're just living their simple lives and doing these bizarre rituals for seemingly no good reason at all. I've probably talked myself in circles about this, but that's all I really wanted out of it, just one moment where I was like 'okay I fucking buy why they are doing this.'",c7y18a

I think that is meant to contrast the other characters. Or they are meant to contrast Dani as this is her story. Josh/Christian were studying anthropology and observed everything from a distance. And the other guy was a typical dumb American type. They just observed while Dani absorbed. A good example was her seemingly miraculously learning Swedish. 

I wish Josh lived longer. He provided a very nice glimpse into the mechanics and workings of the Horga. 

I also wish there was another dream sequence for Dani. Anyway. I started ranting lol",c7y18a
esobjuo,I agree. I was disappointed that the second half of the movie was less intense than the first half. Seeing all the characters get killed off at the end wasn't really that interesting since that's just par for the course for cult movies. I was hoping for a more creative ending.,c7y18a

Is it only women that get brutalised?

Why does something have to make up for or change that fact?

Are you saying that the history of the horror genre is sexist against women?

I would say that the reason that people are making a big deal out of the male treatment in Midsommar is because male bashing has become an increasingly common practice in modern movies. I don't think the horror movies from past decades were trying to bash women. Women were a popular trope in horror films but not for any malicious reason. These days we have become polarised largely due to feminism and any male sentiments shown in movies whether overt or subtle are being viewed with a very critical eye. Movies are used as a vehicle to reinforce feminist narratives and generally send hateful and baseless messages about men.

This review from the critical drinker is pretty accurate .. [https://youtu.be/DB-Fw3P\_97I](https://youtu.be/DB-Fw3P_97I).

etc14sl,"I don't think that's too ridiculous a theory, and seems like something Ari Aster would love to subtly play on in a film like this. Christianity and Paganism are at odds with each other. More often than not we see after a death of a loved one a person embrace religions for comfort, the antithesis to paganism. Here Dani goes against that stereotype, and after long battles she embraces it all in the final scene. That play on words with the name 'Christian' could well be true too, so well spotted!",c7y18a
eu0e3q9,"Friend and I (he’s an Anthro Major actually) said the exact same thing and it’s not ridiculous. Here’s why:
The Christian view on sex, the body, is of a very different temperament than the old Norse ways. The Norse embrace nature, the earth, the connection to the soil (when Dani trips she sees herself apart of the grass and the plants). Sex and fertility is the same. They see it as natural and a part of the cycles of life and visually depict it in their rituals and art (painting of naked women and drinking period blood). Basically the Norse pagan ways are kinda down to earth .. 

Meanwhile, and not to depict Christians in a negative light, but Christianity in general suppresses sexual symbolism, the body and nakedness. It emphasizes shame and sin and weighs this sin of the followers, and duty and submission to a higher God, something not of this world. It’s less of a terrestrial faith you might say, in that it sees what we now understand are normal human impulses and desires, as being wicked and shameful.",c7y18a

esozf77,">and it's the lack of intelligence of not knowing to shut up that gets him killed

Based on what we learn at the end, I think it's safe to assume that they were all doomed from the start.

Before we went into the room where the autopsies were performed, we were given the sort of briefing you'd probably expect.  But surprisingly, they said people generally don't vomit.  They've had a few people faint, but they made it sound like they hadn't ever had someone vomit in response to the stuff seen there.

Mark not wanting to leave is the most suspect, but I guess meant to be justified by the fact that he already had his eye on the girl who eventually lured him to his death.

Putting scissors under a pillow is a folk custom in several cultures, with slightly different meanings generally focusing on protection.

True, the story isn’t about unraveling the motivation behind her sister’s suicide/parricide, but there’s a really powerful contrast drawn between the shot of her shrieking on the couch, with Christian basically doing his best not to respond or get drawn in to her grief, and the response of the women in the commune at the end who shriek with her on the floor after she learns about Christian’s participation in the mating ritual.

I felt like I was watching an art installation film following some beautiful old Nordic religious ceremony for most of the film... but that’s something I would enjoy 💁🏻‍♀️
In the beginning they definitely established great tension and displayed all the (I thought very believable) flaws in the characters and their relationships.

The introduction scene is a lot longer than what it felt like in the script.

Simon leaving was cut and it just shows Connie looking for him and an elder saying she'll come back for him. Additionally, the part where Connie 'sees' the cult taking Simon was also cut and she just disappears from the film. 

There's a scene in the beginning which shows sacrificed bears and that scene was cut too which I felt like should have stayed considering bear imagery had a lot to do with the film. 

There's a scene where all the women go to some lake for a ritual and that scene was also cut. 

The reason for Mark's death was changed from the script and I didn't like that change. 

A lot of the traditions (like the love stone) and the dreams were briefly touched on whereas in the script it was a little more clear what the traditions were so when it got to that scene it wouldn't leave the audience guessing.

etgq5z6,"I think Pelle's brother brought Connie as a potential mate/May queen the same way Pelle brought Dani. He even mentions that they were ""dating"" before she met Simon (which she denies). I think he intended to instill feelings of resentment against Simon (claiming he left her behind) and drive a wedge, but her reaction and unwillingness to be placated ""took her out of the running"" as it were. I think that's also at least partially why he volunteered to be a sacrifice at the end. As for the males, they would not have survived, but had they not committed transgressions against the community they could have been potential mates before being sacrificed.

On the other hand, the community comments on Pelle's intuition/sense for people, and one of the elders tells her ""welcome home"" upon meeting her, so maybe she was meant to be the one from the start.",c7y18a

It was 21st of June, it was up north (Sweden) which means that day (and the adjacent days as well) there was no absence of sunlight at all. I remember myself when I visited my sister in Sweden. I arrived at the beginning of June and when we arrived home from the airport, dropped my stuff and being a bit euphoretic from expecting an adventure, came up to them (my sister and her husband) and asked where are we going to party? They were like, dude, it's 11.00 pm, we are going to sleep and so are you. I stared in disbelief because it was bright outside! I looked at the clock and tried my best to convince myself today's day is over, time for bed. The next two months I thought numerous times about the strange feeling of being like hypnotized at times, it was all related to the nightime/daytime balance shift.

My feeling is Pelle had talked about her fondly to them/they knew he had a crush on her, and perhaps they wanted ensure she felt most important to them.

I think her smile at the end is indicative of the fact she has very much found her new family - one who grieves with her (screaming together), helps her cut her losses (Christian) and allow her to be something of a matriarch (no way was it an accident that she won the dance around the maypole).

112 INT. CHICKEN COOP - CONTINUOUS 
Christian enters. He shuts the door behind him. Chickens flap stupidly about.
Christian tries to regain his composure. As he tries to sober himself up, a barely audible MOANING is heard. He looks up, startled, to SEE...
Across the room, JOSH has been chained to a fence. He is shirtless, his eyes are half-open, and the SKIN of Josh’s upper abdomen has been stretched OPEN to expose his LIVER and the corners of his ribs. If it weren’t for his faint moans, it would be difficult to discern whether he was alive.
The gnarled edges of Josh’s wound have been covered in bird feed. It’s clear that the birds have been at it. In fact, one chicken is currently (and feebly) trying to flap its way up to Josh’s open wound, and one CROW is perched to Josh’s side.
Frozen in horror, Christian stares unblinkingly.
Josh?
CHRISTIAN
Christian’s eyes fill intensely with TEARS. He starts toward Josh. As he arrives near him, he begins to repeat:
Jo--
CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
Josh’s eyes BURST open and he GASPS wretchedly for air. He is thrown into violent, gurgling convulsions.

INT. TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS 

Josh sneaks into the Temple. He creeps over to the pedestal featuring the holy book RUBI RADR. He pulls out his phone, turns on the FLASHLIGHT, and begins taking silent PHOTOS - page by page - of Rubi Radr’s text.

While he anxiously photographs, Josh keeps glancing up at the Temple DOORS, making sure he’s still alone. He has photographed about fifteen pages when he hears the front door CREAK open.

Josh FREEZES. He looks up. Through the Temple’s open doors, he sees SOMEONE standing in the dark foyer. The person is barely visible in the dimness. After some scrutiny, Josh makes it out to be MARK. He is standing motionless.

JOSH

Holy fuck. Mark?

But Mark doesn’t move or speak.

JOSH (CONT’D) (whispering)
What the fuck are you doing? Close the door! We’re not supposed to be here.

Mark still doesn’t move. Despite how hard it is to see, one can tell that his body looks BULKIER than usual. And his face seems somewhat SWOLLEN.

Josh looks unsettled. He starts moving toward the door.
JOSH (CONT’D) (whispering)
Mark? Hello? What the fu--?

MARK steps forward. It is now bright enough to see... This isn’t Mark. It’s a LARGER MAN, and he’s WEARING MARK’S SKIN (which is stretched uneasily over the man’s bulkier features). Upon closer inspection, one might identify these features as belonging to ULF.",c7y18a

INT. CHICKEN COOP - CONTINUOUS 
Christian enters. He shuts the door behind him. Chickens flap stupidly about. Christian tries to regain his composure. As he tries to sober himself up, a barely audible MOANING is heard. He looks up, startled, to SEE...

Across the room, JOSH has been chained to a fence. He is shirtless, his eyes are half-open, and the SKIN of Josh’s upper abdomen has been stretched OPEN to expose his LIVER and the corners of his ribs. If it weren’t for his faint moans, it would be difficult to discern whether he was alive. The gnarled edges of Josh’s wound have been covered in bird feed. It’s clear that the birds have been at it. In fact, one chicken is currently (and feebly) trying to flap its way up to Josh’s open wound, and one CROW is perched to Josh’s side.

“Josh?”
Christian’s eyes fill intensely with TEARS. He starts toward Josh. As he arrives near him, he begins to repeat:

When she first learned about her sister, that was an absolutely tragic scene that she completely sold me on.

It's especially likely that it might have been recognized since *ättestupa* is a real-world thing.

DANI, watching the burning house with fraught eyes, is suddenly met with a wave of conflicting emotions. Her expression curdles into one of sheer HORROR and DISGUST. Then it becomes one of deep SORROW and SHAME. Her eyes well with tears. The singing has now HARMONIZED and has risen to an insane, operatic pitch.

We cut to an immense WIDE. Dani’s back is in the f.g. and the burning house is in the b.g. Overcome, Dani buries her face in her hands. Breaking into gentle sobs, she begins to walk aimlessly to the side. We TRACK alongside her, keeping her centered. She is circling the house, pulling at her hair and face in increasing anguish. She is WEEPING now, and the house (ever- present in the b.g.) has become ENGULFED in the raging flames.

Dani begins MOANING and SCREAMING. Her howls almost harmonize with the singing in the b.g. The fire ROARS and CRACKLES in the distance. It’s apocalyptic.

Soon it’s uncertain whether Dani is crying or LAUGHING. Her legs become weak and she collapses to her knees. Four Hårgans (one of them being Pelle) run into the scene, carrying a LARGE CHAIR - Dani’s throne.

The Hårgans lift Dani by the arms and SEAT her in the throne. They then HOIST the chair into the air.
On the upward LIFT, we cut to a tight CLOSE-UP of Dani’s face. She is being carried forward. Her expression, which begins as one of great distress, slowly starts to TURN. Her agony subsides into sudden CONFUSION. What’s happening? Where am I? I’m on this chair, being carried! Her expression goes from
FEAR to EXCITEMENT to CONFUSION again. She suddenly lets out an abrupt LAUGH (which we can’t hear over the music and the now-deafening FIRE). Dani is now being taken over by an invading sense of pride and contentment. This soon evolves into a manic exhilaration. Dani BEAMS. She has been embraced by a new family. She is Queen. She is not alone.
 
A SMILE finally breaks onto Dani’s face. She has surrendered to a joy known only by the insane. She has lost herself completely, and she is finally free. It is horrible and it is beautiful.

That's not to defend the ending, per se. I also have problems with how things play out after they reach the community - specifically, since the elders' sacrifice. I don't know whether that's deliberate or not, since the two characters who react most sensibly (Simon and Connie, who loudly object to the sacrifices and then want to get tf out of there asap) are killed off immediately, but the way the main group reacts and goes on, shrugging off all common sense, almost, made little sense to me.

I didn't really know anything about it before I just randomly decided to check it out by myself one night and it completely ruined me for weeks. Midsommar was almost upbeat compared to Hereditary, but I definitely recognize that feeling of how weird it is to walk back out of a theater into the real world by yourself. The worst thing about it is how you don't have anyone to talk to about what you just saw, so you have to process all of that craziness by yourself.",c7y18a

We all had slightly different interpretations about why Dani made her choice (ranging from insanity to emotional manipulation to anger)  but we thought it fit and it was somehow both horrifying and darkly hilarious that Christian was sewed up into a bear pelt.

etb5vxd,">are the other community members sharing HER pain, or the pain of those burning in the fire

I took it to be that they're sharing the pain of those in she fire, and she was sharing it along with them (as the women did for her). Her smiling at the end is her realizing she's part of something now (in other words, a new family) that she can bear the burden of everything with, and it brings her a peace of sorts.

I feel like Pelle likes her, but also Pelle has motives for bringing her along and his plans don't work so well if Dani trusts Christian more than the community, so he probably does some things to try and drive a wedge between her and Christian, so that she will have to lean more and more on the community and its customs. I don't know that she would have chosen an outsider over another community member at the end if he doesn't do all the things he does during the trip, on top of what the rest of the community is trying to do.",c7y18a
etgng50,"I think that is absolutely what is going on. There’s a banner over the road when they first drive in that is encouraging people to vote to stop mass immigration in Halsingland. That fact seems to suggest that this commune may well have originated as a belated effort to insulate themselves from an increasingly diverse world that they fear. So, they went out and cherry-picked some half-assed collection of supposed cultural practices that they didn’t really understand or verify but wanted to adopt in order to weed out the unwelcome brown skin types and keep women in their place. Conveniently, they won’t need to fund a health care system for their elders either, since they have the cliffs.

I think that is maybe part of the role of this 90-year ceremony claim. It’s possible that this group hasn’t even been around for that long - that they throw it out there to try and demonstrate that they are built on long-standing traditions that stretch back forever, when in fact they’re probably just a bunch of paranoid racist loons who spun this idea up a generation or two ago in a state of paranoia about what they see as a dilution of their race and culture.",c7y18a

Just got back and I was alone as well in a theatre. It  made the experience even cooler. I did think it got a little long in the middle tbh but overall enjoyable.

Typically this sort of horror needs to have that uneasy feeling. That sense that something isn't right. But in this film it always seemed really obvious what was going on. The entire time I felt like I had a strong grasp of exactly what was happening and never really felt surprised. Even in the few instances where there were original elements they were outright stated well in advance to remove any potential lack of understanding (e.g. the love spell/fertility ritual was directly shown to the audience, step by step). If anything my concern would be that it felt very formulaic, following exactly in the footsteps of earlier folk horror like *The Wicker Man* or the novel *Harvest Home*.",c7y18a
etpw3am,"i agree completely, it was very intense. some of the people in the theater with us laughed a little at some of the scenes, but i was overall pretty impressed with the level of open mindedness. i think aster rides the line between seriousness, tragedy and wry humor in a way that can make it hard to tell what's what, a bit like the sopranos or even the smiths. maybe that's a silly comparison to make but i felt like there were some definite winks of humor to the audience in there.

i don't understand anyone who says it's an accidental comedy, though. i definitely found it extremely disturbing in setting and tone in particular. it's hard to shock me with a film, unfortunately, being pretty desensitized, but this got to me really hard.",c7y18a

about the breathing, that's what the world looks like when one takes certain psychedelics like the mushrooms and whatever was in the tea. your interpretation may be correct, but if that was something you weren't aware of i thought it might be of interest that that was what they were going for there. they simulated the feeling of panic and paradoxical separation from and connection with reality during the bad part of a trip very accurately imo.

I also think this movie was way more about how someone vulnerable can be fragile and open to crazy religious/cult ideas and can get pulled in. After being raised very religious and eventually finding my own way I could t help but notice how this cult had many things that reminded of growing up religious.

Almost like you narrated my train of thought. 

I stopped waiting for it to surprise me around the time when Connie disappeared, because every bone in my film intuition skeleton was rattling like wind chimes in a fucking storm. I can't even say I was disappointed, because my expectation was already low.

I'm so done.",c7y18a
f4k716v,You summed it up perfectly. The director really tries a Lynch-esque weirdness and tries to make a film full of symbolism but it doesnt work here. Those beautiful shots and cinematography are wasted due to the story and badly written characters.

Unfortunately what we have is a film that tries really hard to be different but ends up being a bad rip off of Wickerman.,c7y18a

f5k22tf,"It was super pretentious and needlessly long, with no point. It's the kind of movie older people would go to see in the Arclight, and instead of admitting they were horrified and confused, say it's a masterpiece because it 'provoked' something. I hate that kind of film.",c7y18a
f60mrc3,"Josh, yeah I kinda get that.  He was such an insufferable know-it-all and I would assume he had discussed using Harga as a source for his thesis with Pelle.  I was able to suspend my belief that maybe Pelle thought because Josh was interested in Midsommar tradition that it would simply be a fun trip for him to experience.  However, I also think Pelle's ""immaculate sense for people"" lead him to play into the different motivations everyone had for going.  Dani, grief and healing, Josh, study and personal interest, Christian, interest and curiosity, and Mark summer vaca/hot women.

We don't know for sure they are all anthro.  Mark is Christian's best friend, and it looked like they are roommates.  I figure Pelle had plans for Mark from the start.  He tags along and would make for easy sacrifice, ie Skin the Fool.

Christian was so heavily drugged at that dinner table.  He was not sympathizing with Dani, but starting to freak out when he realized she was slipping away.  The Harga had just crowned her May Queen and literally swooped her up and carried her away while he stood their dumbfounded.  They needed to incapacitate him because it was all so obvious just how dependent Dani was on him.  

Christian was used to seeing Dani filled with darkness and death.  That was how he saw her for a long time.  Now he sees her in this brightly lit countryside, almost nowhere to hide, she is done up beautifully, smiling and vibrant WITHOUT him by her side.  Then he sees her completely covered in flowers that are literally breathing and responding to her every move.  By that point it was too late, they were both moving in opposite directions.",c7y18a

What did they talk about before they came? And what did he do all day that he seems so unprepared for most of the things that are happening?

f7h5ymn,"I fully agree. The cult was actually really kind to her; they were all so happy when she became the May Queen, and when she broke down after seeing her shitty boyfriend fucking some other girl, they all mourned with her, in a way sharing her pain. The entire movie up until that point was just her mourning alone with no support, and now she had people who genuinely care about her and want her there.

And while I don't think Christian deserved to die (he was an absolute shitty boyfriend but he WAS drugged and coerced into having sex with this other woman), I feel like it was the only way for Dani to have a truly clean slate. She faced a terrible, traumatic loss, and then was further traumatized by the deaths of the elderly, all the while her boyfriend was being selfish and uncaring the whole way through. Getting rid of him was not only a way to channel her anger at him, but also a way to rid herself of her horrible past and start new. I'm actually extremely satisfied with the ending.",c7y18a

esyn8h9,"I think the cult in general stood for a *farce* of natural phenomena, including emotion, empathy, and the cycle of life. Dani desperately needs empathy to help her deal with the loss of her family. The cult provides a disingenuous, performative version of that -- the women kneeling around Dani, gasping and sobbing as she does -- and as Dani gets further swept up in the cult, she loses touch with reality and spirals into total depravity.

As for nature itself, Pelle claims that nature instinctively knows what to do and that the cult seeks to be in tune with nature. Yet everything they do seems to be working *against* nature. They take hallucinogens to obscure reality, they murder their elders instead of allowing them to die of natural causes, they practice extremely specific and arbitrary rituals apparently informed by the fingerpaintings of mentally challenged inbred children, they create demon-mannequins out of dismembered people and plants and animals, they plant a slab of raw meat and a cracked egg to boost the yield of their harvest.

Also, I see people saying it isn't believable they didn't leave but how do they leave though? They took a long guided hike to get to the camp, and it's made clear that the only way out is trying to hike out, or get a ride to a train station from one of the commune people. It's too late in the day to leave after the suicides, and the next day they are told the truck that would take them to the train is gone taking first Simon, and then Connie away. Plus Mark disappears in the morning with that girl so they aren't going to just abandon him. The day after that is the day the shit really goes down and they are fed psychedelics early on in the day. So I think it's easy to say they should have just left, but how and when?

ev63oyr,"The link doesn't work for me :/ However, just from my experience of the movie, I didn't get that impression at all. 

Assuming you're referring to those scenes where the villagers ""share"" the grief of a particular charatcter (the elder with his legs broken, Dani after seeing Christian ""have sex"", and the people burning in the end), I read them almost as mockery, hypocrisy at the very least.   
Especially the final one, when they all scream and cry and beat their chests etc while the sacrifices are burning, particularly with the guy who had been told he wouldn't feel pain and instead screams in agony, but the people outside can't hear him as they make a show of their ""grief"", and probably wouldn't want to anyway, they'd rather believe in this fantasy that what they're doing is noble and meaningful as opposed to horrific and senseless.

et3r72l,"\+ Love what Ari Aster did with portraying the cult/community. Depiction of emotional manipulation was spot on. It was reminiscent of a church I used to attend, where the pastor seemed to take personal satisfaction in emotional manipulation; he LOVED when people wailed in abandon, cried gut-wrenchingly, or garbled out their shame and pain in front of the community. He was unfailingly nice, too. Women liked him and confessed everything to him because he had ears their husbands did not have. He used such confessed information in his sermons in the most despicable way, claiming things like: ""Anonymous lived with a man before getting married, which is why her poor soul got divorced later on. Now, don't you go and wonder who this person is! She's just one of us; could be any of us. Let us pray for her."" (Of course, everyone went speculating who this divorcee was.) He truly believed he was doing good, that when he used shmaltzy music to set the tone of his sermon, he didn't mean to mess with emotions.

It was the same empathic manipulation I saw in Midsommar. Took me years to get out of that church because I was severely depressed when I joined it; that church supported me through my depression, but at the same time, made me wonder if it was all an illusion. I was in doubt the entire time, even as I so wanted to believe in the bs.

euu8v7f,"From what I can recall of an explanation by Aster, there is a festival every summer that includes certain rituals, which I assume includes the younger individuals ascending to the next age group and the death of the eldest (as we learn from Pelle as he explains the significance of age), various feasts, and the crowning of a May Queen. This specific Festival happens to be the holiest on the calendar, occuring only once every 90 years and requiring the ritualistic sacrifice of outsiders. That's how I understand it at least.

But during the May pole dance, Dani ends up understanding and speaking Swedish (I think) and immediately after she wins the dance and is crowned the May Queen. For a moment she  acknowledges that she can surprisingly understand the girl but then is cut off when she knocks someone over. Then some women exclaim to Dani that she is now part of the family. What if they are a hive mind of some sort? And doing the ritual and drinking the tea inducted Dani into it. It’d also explain why they feel the need to adhere to the cycle and 72year lifespan. They said the female elder that jumped from the cliff had an unborn namesake, maybe they reincarnate so long as a new vessel is provided for their soul to jump into.

In Hereditary it was interesting to see the family slowly crumble and see the kid become Paiman's vessel. In Midsommar, you have no investment in any of the characters. The female protagonist just gets weirder for no real reason and gets absorbed into a violent cult because her boyfriend was drugged and raped. The boyfriend is an arrogant, apathetic weirdo, and the two friends are generic people who suspect nothing about this weird ass commune.",c7y18a

esniv7d,"Definitely wasn't consensual. The woman who sings while holding Maja's hand and Christian's face during the ritual is such an unsettling reference to Sirens. He's not only under the spell, he's been fully drugged into it.",c7y18a
esnisn5,"I agree he was drugged and raped. I don't think the choice for murder was just because of that scene, however. I think it was a culmination of him being shitty and the girlfriend symbolically letting her relationship with him die so that she could fully move on and finish grieving.",c7y18a
esnuxd1,"I reeeealllly don’t think he got raped. And here’s why: 

1.) The first 10 minutes of the movie we find out that him and his friends are incredibly insensitive and emotionally immature, he’s not happy in his relationship, all his friends joke about getting laid, and one of them even states Dani doesn’t like having sex. After the trauma happened it would logically assume things have only gotten worse because Dani seems to be in a crisis/depressive state and Christian still seems pretty unresponsive. 

2.) Christian DID react to that red headed girl when they first got there and there was that dancing line and she flirtatiously kicked him and he then jumped up and joined and Dani sat there looking concerned as if she knew he might be attracted to her. 

And now this is where it gets complicated and partially why I think this movie was bad but.. 

3.) I would not say he was “drugged” because that implies he took them against his will. He knew what was in the water and was even afraid he was going to have a bad trip. Was he forced? Absolutely not. Was he pressured? A little, but at some point an adult needs to take responsibility. If you don’t know how you’re going to act when taking something that will alter you and you know there is a good chance it will effect you badly, then you need to not be taking that thing or put yourself in a safe environment where you would not be able to get hurt or hurt others in case it does go badly.

4.) After he got to the barn yes he was given a pill to get an erection but then he consciously walked over with that erection to the naked woman spreading her legs and he physically moved his body down on top of hers and was coherent enough to perform until orgasm. He was conscious enough that when he realized he finished he ran outside and got embarrassed enough to cover himself with his hands. He was conscious the whole time. Was it a bad trip? Yep. But you don’t get to justify cheating on your girlfriend because of a bad trip and then say you were “confused” and cry rape. If that was the case anytime anyone regretted sleeping with someone, they would use that line. I would say they did take advantage of him, but again he knowingly took drugs that he knew could possibly be bad for him and in a situation where things already seemed weird and was he was fully conscious and awake the whole time, and didn’t say “no” or protest and try and stop in anyway. Not rape. 

BUT if he was given a love potion recipe (pubic hair/period blood, (also I’m pretty sure anyone would be grossed out by a pubic hair in their food?...))anyways then yes I agree it would be rape. But that’s assuming we have to believe the love potion worked. Which would be an element of magic realism that seems hard to believe when the movie focuses a lot on traditions and less on the supernatural. But furthermore, if the love potion had worked, then why would they give him the water with drugs? Why wouldn’t he just naturally go to the girl? Which leaves me to believe the potion didn’t work and wasn’t real but more of a tradition to symbolize “marking one’s territory” .

The whole movie Dani can’t relate to a Christian because he is so distant and unattached. They literally throw in that whole English couple being engaged bit where they’re both super affectionate and Christian and Dani are standing super far apart to emphasize this. He’s a shitty boyfriend to her from the start and the movie paints him as someone who would absolutely cheat on her so it doesn’t make sense for them to suddenly want us to believe the opposite with no explanation. 

But all in all I think this whole plot point of Christian and the girl is weak and doesn’t actually work and this movie is seriously flawed.",c7y18a

Here we go.

The distortion effect the flowers were all unique.

* All the pink roses did the same thing where they would open with a black hole in the center and then close up repeatedly.
* The lilies (I think?) were always spinning somewhat slowly.
* The magnolias were always opening and closing.

&#x200B;

Also:

* The flowered ""i"" in Ari Aster's name during the credits is a flower called an **aster**
* Maja (the redhead) wore **striped carnation** flowers in her floral wreath. Carnations usually represent pure love. HOWEVER, *striped* carnations represent a love that cannot be shared (\*cough\* \*cough\*)
* I *think* Dani's wreath was made up of **primroses**, which represent young love (specifically the sentiment of not being able to live without a partner, which usually comes with young love). To be completely honest, though, her flower was the most difficult to figure out, and I'm still not really sure what it is exactly
* We don't actually see Pelle's wreath until the end, when it is revealed that he was bringing his friends so that they might be ""sacrifices"" to fulfill the ritual. However, he also brought in outsiders in order to expand the gene pool, so to speak, and to prevent everyone from eventually becoming inbred.... his wreath was made of **pine** branches. Pine tends to represent wisdom, fertility, and longevity...
* Also: Dani gives a bundle of what appears to be **Goldenrods** to Christian. Goldenrods usually represent encouragement and growth, and are often given to show support for someone after a loss or when they're going through a difficult time (basically given to people to help with depression). My best guess is that this is supposed to be ironic, since he should probably be giving those to her.
* I have yet to figure out which flowers were placed in Simon's eyes in the chicken coup.
* It's also worth noting that Odd (one of the old men; the guy who blows a bunch of shit into Christian's face in the chicken coup) is wearing a unique wreath -- it's mostly made up of some kind of leaf, but I can't figure out what it is.

&#x200B;

P.S. I'm not a botanist or florist (in fact I don't really know much about flowers at all), so take all this with a grain of salt. I mostly just noticed the pattern after watching the credits and wanted to do a little bit of research on it (don't steal my thesis, *\*wink\* \*wink\**).",c7y18a

I thought the acting was awful, and some of the characters reactions to events were off. Dani goes to a party right after her family dies. When friends go missing, it's not a huge deal. Perhaps the latter has to do with the psychedelics, but I think that would be an excuse.

With a little tighter writing and acting, this could have been one of the better thrillers I've seen. Very very unique movie.",c7y18a

I personally don't find it empowering, I found it scary that she succumbed to the cult and went psycho enough to kill him over a cultist (even if he was a horrible person).

fahhxbg,"There’s a lot of misconceptions about this movie. People are so quick to judge Christian when Dani’s emotional neediness has killed their relationship. He barely gets a minute alone, there’s rarely a happy moment, no intimacy outside consoling her, and she’s abusing him just as much as he does by being emotionally distant.

I think we’ve all been/seen someone be in a relationship with a narcissist or hypochondriac. While we can’t tell if those words describe Dani accurately, we do see her behavior and know it’s a pattern. Her sister was ill, she made Dani ill, and it was to the point where it was driving Christian away.

I’m not defending Christian from most of the claims as many are valid. 

I just think they were both wanting something neither had the courage to express. You see it in their passive aggressiveness, her feeling too much and him feeling too little. Dani has every right to be a wreck, but when someone’s a wreck almost hourly for 3 1/2, 4yrs it wears on you. The horror of being in a relationship you can’t leave, and being with a person who doesn’t want you. From the beginning we know the end.

It may happen more frequently than every ninety years, though -- that line is a good hook to bring in people for a ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity to see the ritual, but that doesn't mean it's true.

While Dani gets gradually indoctrinated into the cult, viewers also experience the same feelings of wonder, horror, disgust, alienation, and eventual understanding.

Dani's family died by having their breath taken away. 

Also, regarding suicide: suicide in Dani's previous life (with her old family) was a horrific and tragic act that ends the lifecycle. Suicide in the village (with her new family) is seen as a beautiful rebirth and new beginning of the lifecycle. In the village, suicide isn't senseless or confusing, and it doesn't make you sad; death is as full of meaning and purpose as birth.

f5knu2j,"Ättestupa is an ancient swedish utilitarian practice where we'd push our elders to their deaths from a precipice because they no longer had any purpose and were just another mouth to feed, just like people would leave disabled babies in the forest to die. This ofcourse only happened (if at all, it's still debated about if this was just myth and legend) if there was famine and starvation. No one wants to kill grandpa, but if there's just so much food to survive winter it's a ""does the means justify the ends"" kind of thing. The trolley problem. To kill one to let two live. Medieval winters in a country that is as far north as northern canada were cruel.

Ättastupa is in the village in the movie something that happens everytime someone turns 72 I think it was? So everytime someone turns that age, but that might not be every year.

Midsommar is a Swedish tradition that is celebrated to this day on the summer solstice. We have the dancing, the food, the bonfires, the maypole, the mayqueen, the flower crowns and the special clothes. But ofcourse no killing.

Pelle pretty much explicitly spells that out for her and the audience in that scene where he’s talking to her and they hold hands,c7y18a
esn4hwj,"The Swedish commune, like many other cults, preys upon people who are in pain and therefore vulnerable. Dani is trying to process her family tragedy by looking for a sense of community to help her through it. That’s why she goes on the trip to Sweden with her boyfriend and his friends. Unfortunately her boyfriend still isn’t doing a very good job at making Dani feel less alone. The commune offers a sense of community and a way to process her grief. All of the rituals are about creating narratives to help understand death. As Dani falls deeper and deeper into the cult, she is reminded of her parents and her grief which continues to push her even deeper. That’s my interpretation anyway.",c7y18a

I know he was supposed to be kind of a loser asshole, but I felt so bad and scared for Christian. That feeling of being mentally trapped, disoriented, and isolated is one of my biggest fears - and it was portrayed perfectly with his body language and dialogue. For me it was the scariest and most relatable part of the movie. 

The way Dani was played as the outcast in the beginning of the film, just tagging along with her boyfriend and his friends who don't really want her there in this bizarre foreign place... to eventually everybody else being killed and now Christian is the outcast at the mercy of Dani and her new family. Totally disoriented, drugged, and coerced into a death that he didn't really deserve, but had to watch it coming from a mile away.",c7y18a
eta6vex,"I watched being on acid (2 gummy bears - but weak ones, so more like one regular hit). And oh I was unsure if the visuals were the acid hallucinations or the movie's fx-work :) Turned out it was both. That part I loved.

But also the slower time perception on acid, made this movie feel like a drag. I was stretching my legs hoping it would end soon for what felt like forever!!!! That's the bad part of watching a long (was it long? I don't know, certainly felt like it) and slow peaking film on acid I guess :)

&#x200B;

Ari is definitely a psyconaut! :) 

&#x200B;

\--------

I will say however, that I expected way more from this film. It was beautifully shot and the premise very interesting. But the characters, acted like... not people.

&#x200B;

They witness a cult. They could not recognize it's a cult even after seeing the ritualistic suicide. And these are anthropology and psychology students who cannot realize they are seeing a death cult. ""Oh it's ok they are like heaven's gate -- a cult that killed its members, but this is cool because it's their ancient pagan beliefs"". Come on!

&#x200B;

Some guy was like ""I 'll stay here because that hairy skinny sickly-looking redhead who does not speak the same language as me kinda likes me"". The actors acted like dumb plot devices that are there to just go to the next step and reach to the climax.

&#x200B;

Also, the whole thing with the dance and Dani winning. She seems weak, stressed, she should be jetlagged, it's her first time dancing like that. There is no chance she would win, unless it was orchestrated that she would, or it was divine (or hellish) intervention. Cool! It's slightly hinted that some kind of magic exists as midway through the dance she started speaking swedish. Cool! But then at the end we see the villagers screaming while burning, proving that their sacrifice and beliefs are fake. They are just crazy people in the fields.

&#x200B;

Also ""north"" of Sweden is not crazy uncharted pagan wilderness. North of Sweden is Norway.

&#x200B;

In general, the film is already a cult classic for me, but it's also a very stupid, high pretentious film, that reminds me more of a narcissistic student's art project trying to play with emotions (and failing a lot) and what ifs, rather than a movie that tells a story.",c7y18a

And other things were left to one's own interpretation.

I really loved the movie and how slow of a burn it was. It was just heavy and dread-filled with some holy shit-type gore peppered in throughout. I thought it was beautifully disturbing, sad, and very tragic but never actually scary.

Also, the worst part in the entire movie, for me, was the suicide of the sister. The fact that she duct taped the hose to her head to make sure (I assume) she wouldn't be able to get it off easily if she suddenly had a change of heart about dying, was just super messed up and deeply saddening to me. I can't stop thinking about her.",c7y18a

I definitely want to rewatch this on a trip and see how it differs. I will say the film depicts a shroom trip fairly accurately, especially with the details like how the flower on Dani's head was ""Breathing"" and it felt like the grass was growing into her hands.",c7y18a

The cult share in each others emotions, at the start when the old man fails to kill himself they all cry out in pain, when christian is having sex with the young women a bunch of other women share in the experience writhing in pleasure and joining in. when Dani finds the mating ritual, has a panic attack and is sobbing in distress the women join her and show support. when the temple goes up in flames and the sacrifices start screaming in pain the cult do the same.

&#x200B;

Danis sees the cults devotion and emotional connection to each other, is in an altered state and desperate enough for emotional help that she joins them.

&#x200B;

The two elders who cliff dived to their death where literally just two people who had reached the end of their life, pelle joked near the beginning of the film that once a person reaches 72 they die because life is split into four equal parts of 18 years to represent the seasons and once you pass 72 you die....but it wasn't a joke.

&#x200B;

I think the regular festival happens every year, with the queen crowning and festivities but the ritualistic sacrifice happens every 90.",c7y18a
etk6077,She smiled because the emotional release of the community was therapeutic - when she looked around they were expressing the horror that she had been experiencing since her family’s death. She spent the whole year stuffing down her grief to make the people around her (especially Christian) comfortable and in essence they were the first people she’d met who were actually behaving appropriately and in a way that made profound sense to her. Also with her acceptance by the community and the death of Christian she was finally free of the need to deny the expression of her true feelings.,c7y18a
etmgdd8,"I think that smile was a show of acceptance - if you think about it as an arc, Dani starts things off being really lost and alone, hell, even her boyfriend wasn’t exactly helpful or supportive - she then goes to a place where things initially seem off, and almost constantly do, but she is not only accepted, but also made to make big decisions for them - she wanted to feel like she fitted into something, a family of any kind - that’s what the cult provided",c7y18a
etk5q6n,"Dani broke, she was emotionally vulnerable the entire movie and the cult had been accepting her in a way she had been looking for since the family deaths . That combined with the constant drugs sent her over.


Ari said the human sacrifice is every 90 years but the other parts still take place every year. He also mentioned that we didn't see the entire 9 days of the festival.

The two elders were the members who reached 73 years of age, when you reach 72, you're slated to die at the next festival",c7y18a
etk8juw,"Very great analysis by everyone. Another question, what is the significance of the bear?",c7y18a
etxmk56,"I didn't view him as that evil of a person. He genuinely believes in the value of the cult. It seems like it's the aspiration of the cult to grow selectively, so when members go out in the world, they're tasked to find like-minded souls who would be open to joining. 

&#x200B;

As mentioned elsewhere, his original plan was to invite his 3 friends, 2 of which could very much become members of the cult due to their interest in anthropology. The third, Will Poulter, was just added baggage. Knowing that they need at least 4 outsiders to sacrifice, that means he could would be recruiting 2 new family members and 1 sacrifice. Which those are pretty good recruitment numbers to put up. 

The inclusion of Dani was just icing on the cake; it's hinted at that he has feelings for her early on.",c7y18a
eu323d6,"Definitely the most affecting I’ve ever seen. At first I was downright terrified by the swaying elder women and their chanting, but as the camera focused on Maja, it became much more warm and inviting, and more specifically, it felt like a supportive community rite of passage(which is exactly what it was). Obviously the process leading up to it was supremely fucked up and manipulative of Christian, but the ceremony made me feel a great sense of community togetherness.",c7y18a

eu4ky5v,"Don’t think it was “they”.  Pelle particularly wanted her because he was in love with her.  I think the rest of the cult just wanted to see her become part of the community, whether in death as a “new blood,” being spared by the May Queen, or becoming Queen herself.  They just want to absorb as many people into their mindset as possible.",c7y18a
eu3utxe,I thought it was just because she was the last one standing in the dance competition.,c7y18a

euaourv,"I personally felt sorry for her. I think she’s been manipulated by the group to think they’re the fun happy family she didn’t have, and she was tricked into seeing Christian ‘have sex’ so she’d turn on him fully. Also she’s drugged to the eyeballs, and my suspicion is she’s been more drugged than the others the whole time (she was given a tea at the start when the others had the other things to trip on). Both her and Christian are being manipulated big time but they def want to keep Dani at the end I think",c7y18a
euc3t4n,"My initial (first half of the film) reactions definitely leaned toward horror. Not just the manner of Dani's tragedy, but the jump-cuts and sudden changes in sound were disorienting and made me uncomfortable. When Dani and crew arrived in the village, I was certain she would be sacrificed. 

Eventually, as Christian and company's motivations became more selfish and vile, I realized that this was actually Dani's healing journey; this family unconditionally included her, encouraged her, grieved with her. Sacrificing Christian was a necessary step for her to shed her toxic past. I didn't think it was ambiguous at all.",c7y18a
euh6x32,"I didn't see Dani as thinking much about her boyfriend's death as much as reveling in that she now has a family that will share the load of grieving with her.   Choosing the boyfriend to die was more about letting go of the last ties to her prior life (and probably sanity) than seeing him screwing in the barn.

I find thinking about it that way makes the movie much darker.  It also makes me wonder how she'll feel once the drugs wear off?  My guess is that insanity will take over.

Weird thing is that she most likely won't live long enough to see another sacrifice like this since it only happens every 90 years.  She will get to see plenty of 72 year olds take the plunge.",c7y18a
euzjzwj,"I saw it as she basically was looking for a ""replacement family"" like Pelle mentions happened to him as a boy. She couldn't find that in her friends and partner, but she did with the cult because they were so far from everything she knows. It's like, the farthest thing away from her previous life. 

It's a sad ending though, because I don't think just trying to replace your family is a good coping mechanism (obviously even worse when the replacement family is a ritualistic death cult).",c7y18a
f18ugq2,"Completely agree. It had it's moments, the scene where Ulf is wearing Mark's skin among the top for me as far as something actually SURPRISING finally happening . But overall it was just way too predictable, way too derivative and just not at all what I was hoping for from the man who made the wholly compelling Hereditary. You saw all the story beats coming way in advance, and in case you had the slightest doubt where things were going they added spoiler-filled PAINTINGS throughout the whole movie to really squash any lingering hopes you may have had that things wouldn't be as obvious as they seemed. 

And my God, could it be more indulgent? An editor really needed to take a pair of scissors to some of those dancing/celebration/festivity scenes that just went on and on without adding a hint of tension or foreboding or anything but the same repetitive visual aesthetic being hit upon again and again throughout the movie. Gorgeous shots, brilliant tone-setting, but completely indulgent and redundant after the 17th time we have to watch a ten minute ceremony scene.

Meh, the more I think about it the more let down I realize I truly was. Here's hoping his next film gets back on track because if I wanted to watch Kubrick or the Wicker Man, I would just go right to those movies instead of watch a gratuitous homage.",c7y18a

But once he died, I just feel like it ran out of steam. The tension stopped building since we only had two people left and we knew more death was going to occur and I was able to predict what was going to happen later on, because like you said, it just plays off of the cult movie tropes very well.

Only on the surface. The old couple didn't look too happy at their last dinner. Or afterwards, certainly.  The guy who volunteered to sacrifice himself at the end didn't look too happy when he was burning alive.

All she saw when she looked through the keyhole was Christian having sex with another woman. She likely assumed it was consensual because she'd doubted his commitment to her since the beginning of the film (as revealed in her phone conversation about whether or not she was scaring him away). And, of course, her comment about him being likely to leave her behind. So she was already primed to believe he'd be capable of cheating on her. And the cultists did nothing to dissuade her of that notion.

On top of that, I think on some level she blames him for her sister's murder-suicide. He advised her to ignore the email. Deep down, some petty part of her likely resents him for that.",c7y18a

However, my companion got the opposite impression—that we were SUPPOSED to be upset at what happened to Christian. 

I also don’t get all the comments about him being so horrible. He did the best he could in the situation. He obviously wasn’t that into Dani, but he put his own feelings aside to support her in her time of need and even stood up to his friends for her. Yes she apologized a lot and seemed overly eager to do whatever he wanted, but the truth is that didn’t come from him. It came from her.",c7y18a

f1e5xty,"I thought they actually set up why they would stick around pretty well. We know that Christian has been stuck for a while now. Stagnant relationship, PHD thesis he is supposed to be working on but has no inspiration for. Finally, he finds a place where he is inspired to work on his thesis. He's an anthropology PHD student, so he's going to be very permissive and accepting of other people's cultures, even in the extremes. Same goes for Josh. 

It's batshit crazy to us, but they've been studying things like this for a long time. Study and research has always pushed people to do things that in any other context would seem insane. Nothing suggests they are in danger until shit hits the fan in pretty quick succession. Would you really believe that you were brought to be a ritual sacrifice? Think of it from their perspective. Suicides happen, crazy. Maybe you debate leaving but you can't leave that day because train is done for the day, the next day the car is gone taking other people out. The next day, the first day you could leave without trying to navigate a forest in a rural part of a country you don't know, is when the shit hits the fan. There really isn't a ton of time to process the shock and clue into the fact that you are in danger. I think if they hadn't established the guys who are the driving force behind staying as anthropology grad students it would be a much bigger leap than it ends up being. The suicide ritual is so archaic and insane that being the person who got to study it would be an enormous draw for someone presumably looking to work in the field of anthropology. The director's cut does a better job of setting why they'd stay, and establishing that Dani actually sees what is coming and points it out.

Dani stays though because she just lost her whole immediate family. The only real meaningful social connection we see her having left is Christian, he wants to stay. Even then she tries to leave after the suicides and doesn't really decide to stay until after she snorts a sedative. The only character who seems like they would have wanted out sooner is Mark, but dies really quickly and doesn't see the suicides, only hears about them second hand.",c7y18a

Dumbest characters ever. I didn't even care if they all died at that point. The English couple were the only ones I could root for, and I was sad when they got killed off, even though I expected it.

Back in the 50’s or so they raised kids separately in a “kid barn” away from their parents and I think in some rare cases without the kids even knowing who their parents were.

She was also sitting at the end of the table opposite the female spiritual leader, was the first to eat and the last to drink. There are clear parallels but we weren’t told whether she would be a sacrifice or not.

Josh was obviously a goner. Notice that the couple from London also seem to be somewhat mixed race. And Mark was white, and was even being groomed by that one girl showing interest in him, but then he pissed on the tree and proved himself the jester fool, so that was that. 

Not sure why they ended up paralyzing Christian, maybe just because he discovered the Blood Eagle guy (Simon I think)? And then it was Dani who chose him to die.",c7y18a
f5n8qse,"I figured they had plans to kill them anyway, due to the need for 4 'new blood' sacrifices. I assume it happened the way it did due to how the people acted while at the commune. christian for example didn't do anything inherently offensive to them while there, which is why he made it as far as he did? (either that, or they wanted his genes to carry on for some reason and why they picked him to mate with Maja)",c7y18a
f5mm7k7,Simon and connie lost their shit about the suicide ritual and offended them. That's probably why.,c7y18a
f7cnln1,"To answer your first question, the festival only takes place every 90 years. Since the elders commit suicide when they reach 72, there would have been no living person there who has taken part in the ceremony before.

For your second, it would seem so. The only way we see Mark after he is killed is when someone is wearing his skin, which suggests that the meat from his body was used for the pie fillings. 

For the fourth question, Pelle tells us early on in the movie that the cult sees human life like the seasons with each 18 years being a new season. 0-18 is Spring, then until 36 it's summer, up to 54 is Autumn and then until 72 is Winter.",c7y18a
f7dtjgf,"To answer 4) it was explained in the film right after the ""suicide"" of the elders that the community sees living past 72 as fighting life which is something they do not believe in - they rather end life peacefully and joyous than live in pain - and we kind of see that message across the board. The idea of embracing life openly (dancing in the open, sleeping in the open) and once life has embraced one must leave peacefully

To answer 3) One thing that we can easily discern is the natives loyalty to their tribe - that is why I don't think she was necessarily having regrets (or else that would imply that the people themselves don't believe in their own system which isn't the case) but rather it seems that she knew her time was up and would simply miss her time alive - I think (to me) this part showed us exactly how faithful they are in their belief 

8) I assumed they paralyzed him using some drug (they seem to have a huge variety of drugs) - I also assumed they stuffed him in through the rib cage since we see their abilities to work the human body on display with the various sacrifices (e.g. what happened with the British male character found in the chicken barn) 

The older guy was showing how to remove the bear guts without puncturing them or damaging them

10) I looked back in the film and I did see Josh' mouth move during that scene a small bit so I assume its his voices but then again I also thought they raped him",c7y18a

And then...I started adding up all of the manipulation and deceit originating from the commune that led to that moment (not to mention the murders of course, and their supposed justifications), and really felt how Dani's final moments on screen are (hopefully) the bottom tail of a downward spiral - that she's gone off the deep end, been willing to overlook mortally threatening red flags in exchange for the more empathetic relationship she thinks she might get from the commune.",c7y18a

I went in expecting something interesting but weak, but I was really pleasantly surprised. Pugh’s performance specifically was far far better than it came across in the trailer, and the commitment to long takes where all the actors are having to work off each other instead of relying on editing to manufacture performances had me really loving how naturally and patiently each beat unfolds.

I think it’s specifically this idea of communal grieving and experience, something we used to do/how societies and cultures were initially created, but that we have since, especially in Western society, ostracized ourselves from. 

This was an extremely gruesome and uncomfortable story (although I don’t believe it pulled any punches—it was very evident what would happen, just not so much in specifics) but I wouldn’t label it a horror movie. Maybe a kind of, coming-of-age, narrative. A return from the wilderness, back to the village where you are embraced by the whole and have become an adult but always have a place to call home.

But I also think this community has been doing this for so long that they are all experts at subtle manipulation and lulling people into a false sense of serenity because they present a united front of peace and love.  Keeping them drugged also helps. 

I think part of the pilgrimage is selecting sacrifices they believe can be easily manipulated.  They don't choose random strangers.   They befriend the people,  get to know their aspirations.   Pelle knew Josh and Christian,  as anthropology students,  could be lured to study the ceremony.   He also knew Dani was vulnerable, with no family and a strained relationship with her lover.  That is why he was thrilled when she joined them.  They were perfect dupes.",c7y18a
et8ru0n,"I think they were. One thing that the argument about whether Christian ""deserved"" what Dani did or not misses is that ultimately it didn't matter. Christian had been invited on the trip by Pelle even before Dani's family died -- in that first conversation Pelle seems as dismissive of her as the rest, urging Christian to dump her if that's what he'd like. Certainly Pelle's not interested in inviting her along until her family dies and she becomes isolated and vulnerable. (In hindsight, he was probably counseling Christian to dump her because that would be one less person to wonder what had happened to him after he failed to return from Sweden the next summer).

So Christian was always going -- as Dani says herself ""You already bought your ticket!"" If Dani's family had lived, he would have gone with Pelle's group and would almost certainly have died. I say ""almost"" because it's possible another person would have been recruited who would have been sacrificed instead, and Christian could have been the ""Dani"" of the scenario, surviving but being absorbed into the cult along with his fresh genetic material. But it's overwhelmingly likely that he was going to his death, with or without her. Her presence didn't mean the difference between life and death, but it did greatly affect the *kind* of death he had. So yes, like Hereditary, the destination was set -- the only question was which road he would take to get there.",c7y18a

This scene is a reflection of that one, only instead of being alone with her pain, these women share it and support her. They echo it back to her as if to say, “We’re with you.”

This is actually a technique that midwives use. Women in labor moan or yell and the people in the room with her make the same noises. A neat little empathy trick that allieviates pain for some people and makes them feel less isolated.

So that scene is absolutely bizarre and eerie and borderline comedic... but I also found it comforting. Finally, she is being embraced and not rejected for her suffering. I saw this as the moment when Dani decided to fully reach for the temptation of comfort, family, and care the cult is offering her.

I absolutely agree that she’s the victim of brainwashing and coercion, but I think they mostly won her over with honey, not vinegar. They took advantage of her needs, the weaknesses in her relationship and her grief. They drugged her. 

But I think her smile is genuine. She now believes she has family and can let go of her grief. I can’t say whether that happiness and relief will last, but it’s certainly present.",c7y18a

The sisters of the commune follow her into that building and cry with her, scream with her, and mimic her behavior. this single act was the scariest part of the film

I hated that part, in the sense that it felt really scary. 

Even though Dani was surrounded by a bunch of women who apparently cared for and empathized with her, experiencing something like that would make me feel so isolated and helpless. She was essentially screaming into an echo chamber. It wasn't comforting at all. All those women ""helping"" were just mirroring the grief and fear she was trying to escape from. Maybe that's why mirrors were so prevalent throughout the movie.

I didn't get this feeling. There's no doubt that Christian was a distant shitty boyfriend.  But at the same time he was considering breaking up with Dani before her whole family died. He couldn't do it after the fact that would be a horrible thing to do to someone. He definitely kept a lot of secrets from her and he treated her pretty poorly and that's 100% not okay. I like how they show this with the juxapostion of the happy engaged British couple. Also, it's not exactly like he cheated on her out of his own free will. If anything it seemed like he tried to resist the pressure to have sex with that cult member earlier. Plus he was heavily drugged and manipulated. Hell, I'd argue that he was raped between being intoxicated with psychedelics and that one cult member literally pushing his ass and making him thrust. There's definitely a bit of cruel dramatic irony there as Dani could never know that, but that's ultimately what decided his fate. Definitely a case of being sorry for his behavior too little too late because after he neglected her she was beyond communicating about it.  


So I while I do think he sucked, I don't think he was a complete monster, and I certainly don't think he fate was warranted. They were just a couple who's relationship ran its course long ago. I really liked this film because at it's core it's about laying fire to a dead codependent relationship. At the start of the film Dani allowed Christian to treat her like garbage because she was afraid of being alone, but ultimately she found power in herself. Through this power she took back control of her life, got rid of Christian, and in that she found a new sense of belonging in her new family.

This film is like the ultimate cautionary tale for shitty boyfriends everywhere.",c7y18a

Grief makes people more open for manipulation, more out of touch, and all around poor critical thinking. With a tragedy as disturbing and harsh as Dani's tragedy, that's can lead to very destructive behavior. And that's before adding in the toxic relationship she's in with Christian. Which doesn't help things. Neither does all the drugs and disturbing rituals she's being exposed to. By the end, she has foregone the life she once had for the cult, because her constantly deteriorating mental state allowed it.",c7y18a

She felt bad for leaving too hard on him even before her family died, at which point she had very little support network and those around her made her ashamed of displaying her grief.

The commune is much more welcoming to her than the others (contrast with awkward silence when she sits with Chris' friends). They literally lift her up on a pedestal as the May Queen. They call her sister, she's shown speaking to them in Swedish, she picks up the harvest song super quickly, the girls scream with her in unison through her grief. They showed a good amount of pull for her as well as push. Although her mental health played into her decision to chose Chris over a random villager, it's uncharitable to say it's just a series of traumatic events that cause her to snap out of the blue.

Also, Christian was thematically fucked from the beginning, given the contentious history between the Pagans and the Christians.  The four friends who died were always going to die, they were just killed in ways that mirrored their ""transgressions"".

The cult-friend specifically chose Dani because she was damaged and is the type of person that cults go after to try to convert.  There's a lot of thematic depth here about how cults operate.

Also, Christian's actions are what started a race for information, which is what drove Josh to sneak off at night to look at the sacred runic text and ultimately meet his death.

Obviously it’s twisted because it’s not a healthy kind of relationship — but it’s the opposite of what she had with Christian and her family.  So while we might see it as superficial and almost silly, she may have viewed it at that moment as an indication that she was finally — emotionally — home.",c7y18a

etl022k,"Christian absolutely was shitty. He didn't deserve to die that way, but no one really does. He disregarded Dani's emotions throughout the entire movie, with two exceptions. Not breaking up with her and offering to wait with her for the shrooms. In the appartment argument he plays dumb and then turns it around on Dani and she's starts apologizing. In fact he flat out lies to her. After the ritual suicide when Dani is predictably experiencing intense emotions he tells her to ""take some time to yourself"" and just blows her off. He also took the laced drink intentionally with Mya in mind. The direction makes sure to show that he wanted his inhibitions lowered as he focuses on her right before he swallows the drink. He simply ends up on a horrifically bad trip leading up to the encounter. 

Christian is also a huge dick to Josh. Now Josh is a huge asshole himself, but he was in the right about the thesis. Josh had been planning on doing his thesis on this before they went. It was explicitly stated. Even Dani new Christian was off when he was asking about the commune after she told him about Connie and Simon. Then when the book is reportedly stolen Christian throws Josh under the bus and rolls over him repeatedly. I understand Christian saying he had nothing to do with it, but he went the extra mile. Once again this is something that Dani notices. 

Christian isn't totally horrible at every moment, but he was a terrible dude majority of the film. I agree that he was trapped and that is something to be empathetic to, but he was a bad boyfriend and friend. Christian's friends were just as shitty as he was and it was easy to juxtapose them not caring about anyone with the cult being in sync.",c7y18a

Also, Mark mentions that Christian had been considering breaking up with Dani for an entire year and suggests that he should just get it over with; but Christian declines because, ""he might regret it later if he can't get her back,"" which is a selfish and cowardly reason to not break up with someone. 

Neither of them were fulfilling each other's needs - except Dani stayed with Christian bc she loved him, while Christian stayed with Dani bc he didn't want to risk being alone.

Like in the beginning when she is wrapped up with her sister's vague email that she doesn't know how to respond to leading to the death of her parents. Each time she grieved heavily on screen was a knot being untied, this opened her up to joining the cult at the end of the movie and gave her the unclouded mind that seemed sought after by them. This is mostly coming from my un-nuanced understanding of Swedish culture, I just kept thinking about celtic knots when they showed the murals and during the dance scene.

Also it wasn't clear to me, do they do this every year? Or was it only the once in 90 years thing? Like, what does the MayQueen do exactly? The lore didn't seem as established as it did in Heriditary, but unlike Heriditary, if I watched this again I'm not even sure what to look out for.",c7y18a

et8i39k,"I would argue Christian wasn't an asshole. I went into more detail elsewhere but I will briefly explain.

1st, we get the idea that the main characters sister problems had really been sending her for a loop for well over a year prior. Obviously he had been handling it well up until near the beginning of the film. You can't blame somebody for getting overwhelmed with it without having reprieve for that long. You are asking A LOT. why?

because 2: you cannot help other people unless you help yourself first. It was obviously taking its toll. While others were well into writing their Thesis, he hadn't even picked his topic. He is clearly stressed about it, which tells us he is WAY behind. He is way behind due to everything going on. He was willing to forgo working on his own mental state in order to help her. We can't expect him to do the right thing at this point. He is mentally broken. Nobody is to blame here. The movie tries to brainwash you into thinking its his fault. He is the asshole. Or at least its easy to fall into that trap when really we forget that its one persons opinion and that's it. What we DO see is that despite his friends , who are the REAL assholes telling him to do the easy thing, he STILL does his best to help her. It just seems like a lazy attempt because the man is mentally beat down at this point. It wasn't that he didn't want ""to hold her"" or whatever. It was that he was incapable, whether he wanted to or not.

I fear Christian is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people. Hell. I thought he was an asshole the entire film until I got home and thought about it.",c7y18a

I can’t even believe how many people point to Dani’s smile as a sign of healthy empowerment. Was the smile at the end of heredity a sign of a good thing?? No. The cult was run by a bunch of manipulative old men who stay in power by making up scripture. It is not a story of real female empowerment, but how cult’s manipulate people at their lowest.

But lol bf a dick and she was happy about it. Such a cathartic smile right?? Pretty absurd that is the take away. Pele manipulated what he knew was an unhealthy relationship when Dani was at her lowest. This is intended to be a terrifying ending, not happy at all.

Sadly I’m not shocked that people interpret this as a badass ending for Dani because people fall for faux empathy from cults all the time. Seeing people’s sick reaction to the movie makes it all the more frightening.",c7y18a

Not only does Dani not appear to be in her right mind by the end of the film, but she also appears to let her emotions control her. Which is something she struggled with from the start of the film- a panicked demeanor to begin with even before her family perished, something which was aggravated and made worse when she lost them. 

Progression would be if by the end of the film Dani WASN'T so reliant on Christian and wasn't driven so strongly by her feelings of anxiety, distrust, and anger. But she chooses to burn him. 

I'm not sure what could more strongly show that if anything she has retained the emotional problems and ALSO gone mad under the cults influence.

I think she is really happy *because* she's brainwashed.

It makes them more susceptible. Dani was a perfect candidate because she was already so codependent and the loss of her family spiraled her even more so down the wrong path.

Mark is the only one with a logical excuse, as he had not witnessed the cliff. Maybe with Dani we can accept it since she's not all there emotionally or whatever.

but as far as Josh and Christian? I find it impossible to believe they are THAT deep in their studies to be naive enough to stick around. Makes no sense at all, they would be completely aware of the potential danger of being in a ritualistic community that partakes in sacrifice and realistically would have reacted much differently.",c7y18a

euczjyk,"I think the point was for the cult to be evil not the characters. Similarly to get out, a person from a fucked up community goes out into the world and brings people into the community to exploit. The character arc for Dani, I think, was for her to find a family or sense of belonging. The director says that the film is ultimately a ""breakup story"" which is weird I guess because they don't actually break up. They just drift apart and then she kills him.

During the dance they did, it was like they were hyping themselves up to finally work up the courage to break free — literally without thinking just start hightailing it in reverse until the hook ripped through their skin and let them go.

eswzpqk,"Great post. Christian has a lot of failings as a human being but wanting to break up with Dani isn't one of them. Anyone who's ever been in (or even adjacent to) a relationship like that can see both where Dani is coming from (throwing herself on someone else for support the way she's probably had both her sister and her parents throwing themselves on her) and where Christian is coming from -- he's stuck in this relationship where he simply doesn't have the capacity to handle the constant emotional monsoons, and after a while it's become clear that this will never, ever, ever get better, at least not unless some drastic changes are made. There's nothing wrong with saying, at some point, that you just can't handle this. 

Reynor was absolutely right that Christian didn't deserve his fate, and I'm surprised people thought he did -- I really liked the movie, and I believed that *Dani* thought he deserved it at the end, but she's also just been through a long period of emotional and mental torture, the cult has been flattering and lovebombing her, and of course she's drugged to the gills with whatever they put in her drinks.",c7y18a
eswsgeb,"I absolutely hated christian’s character but the cult knew what they were doing, they preyed on Dani and Christian’s weak points, knew that Dani could be manipulated because of her grief and that’s how they pulled her in, I didn’t really believe that much of the empathy that they were putting up.

However, with regard to Christians character I don’t think it’s as simple as ‘he just didn’t break up with her soon enough’. The script at the start is really telling of his thinking, he is actually cowardly and doesn’t want to support her, and he also fucks over his friends as well and ultimately tries to shirk all responsibility for anything throughout the whole film. He’s meant to be a coward in all senses not ‘just’ in his romantic relationships. As to whether he deserves his fate, none of them do, they’re lambs to the slaughter from the outset, even Dani as the only one who survives the movie. Her smile at the end isn’t a good one- she’s drugged to the eyeballs by a group of people who have been holding her captive. She might ‘win’ in the sense of living but she’s literally drinking the Kool Aid now.

EDIT- also on reflection I’m not sure I agree with your reading on Christian’s relationship with Dani either. In the opening convo with his friends it’s clear this is a conversation they’ve had a million times and I think someone refers to the word years? So he’s been having this same conversation for a long time. You’re absolutely right that people can have different levels of need from a relationship that one person isn’t up to, and that’s ok, there’s no right or wrong there, but Christian does this pouty ‘well what if I *do* miss her’ type of thing that seems deliberately selfish and a conscious decision from the writer, so I don’t think it’s as simple as he’s just not stepped up to do it, it reads like he’s been actively shirking it for a long time.

Doesn’t mean you have to agree that her conduct was right. I mean, it was *obviously* wrong in the real world, and cathartically enjoying the outcome isn’t too different from cathartically enjoying any horror violence. What makes it a satisfying narrative (IMO) is just being able to understand the feelings of isolation she had.

Making Christian a mildly unlikeable character is, I think, necessary for making the story work - like, the way he basically butts in on his friend’s research project is narcissistic and cruel. He lies to Dani about his trip to Sweden repeatedly - which is cruel and shitty communication, whether she was emotionally needy or not. 

I don’t think we’re supposed to celebrate at his death. I think we’re supposed to understand that he wasn’t a parficularly kind or thoughtful person, to Dani or to his friends - and the lack of feeling properly supported is what made Dani vulnerable to the cult. 

I think part of what makes the movie uncomfortable and effective too is the way the relationship between Dani and Christian is coming apart in a very realistic way. So I understand why it would strike such a personal nerve for people",c7y18a

et3a0op,"• For some reason, I came away with the strong impression that Christian stole the book. Josh was very clearly much more passionate about anthropology and showed a greater sense of ethical responsibility to respect what he was witnessing and refrain from interfering (but only to a point — hence why he tried to take pictures when no one was watching to realize how he was desecrating the sacred text). Christian was a parasite who showed much more apathy towards both the subject of his thesis and towards the ways his own actions negatively affected other people. 

I think he stole the book and, instead of being worried when Josh disappeared, saw his disappearance as the perfect opportunity to throw Josh under the bus and get off scot-free. His immediate disavowal of even being an associate, let alone a friend, of Josh confirms that for me. All he cared about was his own well-being. This notion that he stole the book was reinforced for me by how panicked and guilty he acted whenever approached by elders after the book went missing. He didn’t just seem like someone who was worried about how the actions of a friend/colleague would reflect on them; he seemed like he was terrified of being found out. I’ll have to rewatch though.

When it concludes, we hard cut to Dani’s parents laying in bed asleep. They are extremely still. Their phone rings, but they don’t answer. Their voicemail box rings, “Hello. You’ve reached -- the Ardor residence. Please leave your message at the tone. When you’re finished with your message, press pound.” After a beep, we find that the phone call is from Dani: “Hey mom and dad, it’s Dani. Sorry I’m calling so late. I’m just checking in to make sure everyone’s okay. I got kind of a scary email from Terri and it sounded like you guys were having some sort of conflict? Anyway, I just got a little worried, so call me when you can, and if there’s anything I can do, just please know that I’m here. Okay. All right. I love you.”

Dani hangs up, and turns to her laptop. An email from her sister, Terri Ardor, titled “dear dani,” is displayed. It reads: “i cant anymore - everything’s black - mom and dad are coming too. goodbye.” Dani stares at this, anxiety rising. 

She picks up her phone, hesitates, and then calls Christian. Four rings. He answers and they have a discussion about how she’s possibly just overthinking this email. She reluctantly agrees and hangs up. Her eyes are wide with insecurity.

It cuts to Dani standing in the kitchen, mid-phone conversation with a friend of hers. She paces when she’s not speaking. They have a conversation about how unsure she is about the future of her and Christian’s relationship. In the middle of the conversation, Dani begins composing an email to her sister Terri. The email reads: ""PLEASE write me back, Terri. You can't just write me something like that and then disappear. I'm worried sick and I think my boyfriend is breaking up with me and I'm freaking out. Please write back. Please."" Dani’s conversation is cut off as her phone beeps with an incoming call. It’s an unknown number.

We cut to a grubby looking pizza parlor where Christian and his friends are sitting in a booth discussing how he should end his relationship with Dani. Moments later, Dani calls him again. Vaguely annoyed, he answers to find an extended, agonized moan. 

“Dani?”

“...no, no, no, no...”

“Sweetheart? What’s going on?”

But now there’s only heavy, frightening crying on the other end. It’s a deep, horrible cry. One of pure animal grief.

“What’s happening, baby? Please talk to me.”

et2xdzf,"I think it’s important to the story that her family is gone and includes a suicide, and the death of both young and old, as opposed to just being dysfunctional or keeping the elder parents alive. For example, if her family were only dysfunctional, it would be probably less likely that Dani would develop the willingness to abandon them entirely for the commune, given her attachment to shit relationships, and especially after seeing the elder suicides. I don’t think the point of the family’s death is necessarily there for us to feel the full emotional impact of it (though I definitely did feel that), but mostly to clearly see its effect on Dani, and to put her into a position where she needs to redefine “family”.

As for the other deaths, it’s reasonable that you wouldn’t feel the loss there - I didn’t either. These are at best remote acquaintances to Dani. I felt like we’re meant to see these as massive red flags that Dani is going to overlook in her search for what she thinks is going to fill the hole left by her now absent family.

The commune’s purpose seemed to me like it wants to revive/preserve a way of life that they can very strictly control the evolution of. They will be hand-selecting or giving birth to any new members, and the result has to be people they want. It won’t likely, for example, be including any non-caucasoids.",c7y18a

Ari Aster described it as a break up film. Consider that angle and how following Andi throughout, you could make parallels to the stages of grief in a breakup. The way I took it, it was less about the cult itself or more like the cult experience was a vehicle to show Andi’s story.",c7y18a

It may seem like unnecessary homework to have to read about a movie when you don't get it and that the movie has failed in some way, but keep in mind every person is different. Some people will ""get it"" right away and the movie is successful in conveying its message to them, and other people might need additional context to help them along.

The death of those people in Dani's life played a huge role in the decisions she made which were a big part of the ritual, and her being there in the first place. She wanted to leave the commune, or at least try, but what kept her from doing that was her connection to Christain, the last remaining deeply connected relationship we see her character having in life and then the promise of family from someone who'd gone through what she was going through, which was really potent for someone in the middle of grieving the loss of her whole immediate family. 

Also it clearly played into her decision at the end of the movie. Christain was her last real connection to the outside world, she chose to sever that tie. With him gone she has no more connection to the outside world anymore. The commune promised her a family and to someone dealing with the grief of losing her family very recently, in shock, and high out of their mind on psychedelics it's probably why she made the decision she made.

By the end of the movie she allows herself to feel ""held"" by people who are willing to take on her pain, and realizes she cant go back to a life where she feels she must continually bottle up her pain.

etbjuxu,"Not trying to convince or persuade you of anything - this wasn't your movie, and there's no way you can be wrong about that. For what it's worth, I didn't see much in the way of deep/hidden/allegorical meaning going on in this story - it seemed a lot leaner and simpler to me than Hereditary, for example. I was skeptical going in that I was even going to like it, though I did like Hereditary and was hoping this one would be at least as good.

For me, the heart of the story is how Dani is going to get through the loss of her family and her shitty relationship, not who's going to die when for what reason. Every story beat served a function of setting up the rules and behaviors of the commune and contrasting relationship behaviors within the commune and between she and Christian. That progression of her character assimilating all of this had to happen gradually, so I didn't experience the 2h 20m duration the same way as people who didn't like it - the pacing to me felt exactly right for her downward trajectory.

For what it's worth, since there are a lot of similar criticisms elsewhere in this thread, here's how I read these elements of the story that you're pointing out:

* The suicides are carried out willingly by the Hårga people themselves - nobody from the commune physically threatens any of the outsiders. People are disgusted that the suicides could be accepted within the commune, and some of them want to leave, but nobody sees a threat to themselves in that ritual. There isn't really a reason why the suicide practice, known to Josh who's been studying these cultures, and then eventually accepted by the group as something the commune believes to be a long-standing custom, would necessarily prime anybody to think they're under physical threat, and the first two disappearances are people whom everyone in the group is expecting to leave. Not everyone accepts the explanations from the commune members - Connie rejects the explanation she's given outright. She and Simon aren't having any of it, no matter what they say. Mark is there to get laid and didn't see the suicides, so no buzzkill for him disrupting his interest in sex and drugs. Christian doesn't even like Connie and Simon's presence there cuz they're the happy couple who are getting married so quickly after meeting, making him look bad, so he's kind of happy to hear news that allows him to cast Simon as a dick to Dani when they find out he supposedly left without telling Connie. We're the audience and so are of course primed to distrust everything from the commune much more critically cuz we already know where it's going.

* Connie's screams, in the spaces where they are heard by other characters, don't sound like human screams. We know they are (and whose they are) as the audience, because we're already primed, but the sound design here pretty clearly distorts and muffles the sound so it sounds weird, but could plausibly be shrugged off as an owl or some other animal, or some weird vocalization from someone else in the commune. And this is happening later in the day, after everyone is expecting Connie to have been trying to get the hell out of dodge and get to Simon, so there isn't an obvious reason to associate the two in a necessarily sinister way.

* The conversation between Christian and Josh makes the most sense \*right after\* the suicides. They're both studying anthropology, the whole function of which is to study human cultures objectively. Christian's late in coming up with ideas for his thesis, has already talked with Dani about the trip maybe providing inspiration for him, and the intense emotion of seeing that suicide shit has lit a fire under his ass to work on something that would hold his interest. Josh isn't freaked because he's already been exposed to the practice even before he saw it, so it's not going to be the same kind of conversation that would happen between, for example, two business majors. The fight between them has them both focused on competing to get the best data on the commune.

* I don't think Dani's so happy with Pelle, but she's also not yet in deep with him to the point where her character would likely go ballistic on him. She spends almost the entire first third of the movie apologizing to people for things that aren't even her fault - in my view, it would be a little odd for her to be able to flip a switch like that. It wasn't so easy for Pelle to calm her down, and he is the only one who has shown her the kind of attention she's looking for, so I think any anger at him is going to be somewhat muted by this. She's even further removed from Josh, so I'm not sure her character at that point would have had the courage to go off on him like Simon or Cassie might have.

* Everything is given to us way up front - there are all kinds of signals early on that people are going to get knocked off, or manipulated into eating pubes, and Dani's going to be the May Queen. This is by design - the story is in how Dani will change under these events. That's what was holding my attention through every scene. Her character isn't one that's going to solve her shit so quickly or with such conviction.

* The duration of each scene and the seemingly languid pace has a definite function in taking Dani through her arc. For example, the scene of the ceremony just prior to the suicide might feel quite drawn out - the outsiders are all talking and wondering when they can eat or whatever, but the commune is very solemn about the whole thing, because two of their members are about to give up their lives. It's very uncomfortable waiting for them to pick up their forks and start eating, but it establishes a reverance and respect between others in the commune and the two making the sacrifice. Dani notices this. It makes sense to make the audience feel that too. Later on, when Dani becomes the May Queen, she now takes on a role that is respected by the rest of the commune, and we see that same reverence in reverse, experience the same passage of time, and realize that she is starting to assimilate to her new family. There's only a couple other table scenes, I think, and both are very brief, where the group talks about the people who've gone missing.

* Yeah, I agree, more things could have gone wrong, but not everything went right, either. Simon and Cassie were definitely both problems they had to manage. I also didn't get the sense that they were 100% rigid on which 4 of the outsiders had to be sacrificed, with the exception of the non-Caucasoids Josh, Simon, and Cassie, or even necessarily that Dani absolutely HAD to be the May Queen. At any rate, this all fell pretty well within the bounds of the standard suspension of disbelief parameters you have in any movie.

Anyway, sorry this one didn't work for you, hope 2019 has better-suited stuff in store...",c7y18a
etdg85t,"In response to the 'why isn't everyone reacting more decisively to the red flags'...I'm partly with you there. However, I also felt like Aster was emphasizing the role that groupthink and social pressure can play in bad decision-making. When there's a giant group of very homogenous folks who are extremely single-minded, I think it can mess with your perception. I think that it's far more likely than we realise that people fall back on the 'I don't want to be rude or to overreact' mindset when confronted with warning signs.",c7y18a
etciqbz,"so point by point...

* Remember, the main reason they are going is so their friend (Josh) can write his thesis on the community. Odd things that would make normal people leave right away are brushed off, that is why they are there, to write a thesis on how this community works. Likewise, their close friend is with them saying everything is fine and that the English couple (they just met btw) left together. They thought it was odd, but their close friend is saying this so they buy it. When Christian decides to do HIS thesis on the community too, well now they just doubled down on not leaving and it pushes them to research more due to the competitive nature. Josh goes into the temple and Christian is seen interviewing the members yet they refuse to share their information with each other. They are competing 
* The scream was quiet enough to be a whisper and none of the group were together at that point to discuss it.
* Remember, Josh knew about the upcoming suicide. The night before he was stunned to hear they were going to witness it, but he didn't share the information with the others. He is doing his thesis on this type of community and that was a real viking tradition that may have occurred in history (lots of propaganda when it comes to Viking history). Christian is just dumb, so you got me there haha
* Dani is upset but she has been spending years in a terrible toxic relationship in which she has had to suppress her feelings and emotions in fear of losing Christian. Like in the beginning SHE ended up apologizing to Christian when HE was the one who never told her about the trip. Dani is essentially being emotionally abused so she pushes down all her negative feelings in fear of upsetting her shitty boyfriend so she with-holds the information in fear of losing him.
* Yea maybe, but it doesn't fall in line with Dani's character
* I mean yea overall it followed a predictable path. But personally, I did not see a lot of the parts coming... the skinned naked man, the blood eagle feeding the animals, the inbred prophet. [A lot of great detail work went into this film.](https://youtu.be/aIssSRm8xUE)
* I mean that is the whole reason for the season for me, I went to this movie ready to slowly solve the mystery of this weird community, but it could just not be for you and thats cool too.
* I think you are missing Dani's character. She wants to be accepted so desperately by anyone so she puts up with a ton of shit from her boyfriend and now that she is an orphan, it has only gotten worse. The community not only drugs her heavily (almost the entire film) they also offer her the opportunity to 'be held' by someone. Due to her past trauma and insane emotional repression combined with the copious amounts of drugs she is doing, she is open to this community as a new family. That is my take on it anyway.

1. I’m not sure what you mean about Dani’s sister having to run outside and climb a tree to get to the second floor. In that scene there’s a shot that shows the hoses leading up the stairs. The first hose leads to the parents’ room and you can see the bottom of the door is sealed with tape. After the fire fighters go inside the room and the parents are put in body bags, the bodies are carried out into the hall and from there you can see the other hose leading to the sister’s room at the end of the hall where you also see the sister with the hose taped to her mouth. The rooms were on the same floor. 

EDIT: Sorry I understand what you mean now about the tape. I see that you were talking about both rooms being taped shut. I could be mistaken but I don’t think that there was tape on the sister’s door. I think it was only on the parents’ door. There would be no need to seal her own room if she planned on taping it to her mouth.

2. The scene where Dani sees her sister in the mirror is when they are in Sweden. At this point Dani’s family died 6 months ago. In those 6 months I’m sure Dani was told by police exactly what happened and could imagine what her sister would look like with a hose taped to her mouth. Perhaps she even saw pictures of the crime scene. 

As we know, Ari likes to show grief after a tragic loss. I don’t think the scenes where Dani is grieving and having panic attacks would be nearly as impactful and gut-wrenching if there were implications that Dani was actually the one who killed them.

I don’t think Dani had anything to do with her family’s deaths but that is an interesting take!",c7y18a

et4set8,"Aster says this is a horror movie and Heredity is a drama. I'd definitely flip those two. This was upsetting  but predictable, like most very good drama. Hereditary kept me off kilter the whole time, like good horror.",c7y18a
eszeqi0,"It's been mentioned, for sure, although maybe not enough because I think the reactions to that scene are telling. I mean, the guy was violated in multiple ways and then put in a bear suit to be burned alive! It was all horrific. Of course, the minute he stepped onto that commune, Christian was an offering for the cult members' needs and no longer had free will. None of them did. 

However, it feels as if the fact that the audience found the rape scene comical--and it was--and also felt a sliver of catharsis over Dani's 'choice' is part of the point; that is, it's a horror film in which the viewer isn't given the normal cues of ""evil"" and coming doom. Instead, we're enveloped in this wealth of surreal sunlit beauty and bright-eyed trippy floral happiness. So even as we know what's going to happen, we're still lulled into dismissing the outright horror unfolding in front of us and sort of unknowingly go along with the suffering inflicted. It's a brilliant piece of dissonance, imo, since it makes the audience complicit and leaves us to explore our own unsettling reactions.

Which is why i think she stayed with him and make excuses for his bullshit. With this cult thing and their “empathy” ritual things they do, like crying with dani after seeing her boyfriend christian banging the underage redhead, she finds a new home and support that she seems to have been craving since her childhood. Just my two cents",c7y18a
etrl7rf,"The part with Dani and her family is actually a masterful touch and a vitally important piece of the plot; I'll explain why. 

Dani was the only outsider who was actually indoctrinated into the cult and not sacrificed. This wasn't just a chance occurrence. Pelle took a special interest in Dani after learning about her family. You see, cults specifically target people who have undergone extremely traumatic experiences that leave them in severe mental / emotional tribulation. Dani's trauma of losing her entire family was further exacerbated when the cult set Christian up to essentially cheat on her. Remember, to Dani, Christian was really her only comfort after losing her entire family; he was the only one she had to confide in. The cult ripped them apart and severed Dani's trust of him, leaving Dani feeling incredibly alone, depressed, and desperate. The cult appealed to Dani's manic desperation by promising her love, happiness, and above all else, family.

This is why Dani was able to smile at the end of the movie. All of her feelings of loss (from her family) and betrayal (from Christian) were remedied for her when she accepted her new ""family"".

She would never have been open to joining the cult had she not lost her entire family, as she would have been motivated to return to them. However, since she had no family waiting for her, she had nowhere to go. She felt lost, and without a place to call home. That's why she was so happy to accept the cult as her new family",c7y18a

""**Horror** is a genre of speculative fiction which is intended to **frighten**, **scare**, **disgust**, or **startle** its readers **by inducing feelings of** **horror and terror**. Literary historian J. A. Cuddon defined the horror story as 'a piece of fiction in prose of variable length... which **shocks**, or even **frightens** the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of **repulsion or loathing**'. It creates an **eerie** and **frightening** atmosphere. Horror is frequently supernatural, though it can be non-supernatural. Often the central menace of a work of horror fiction can be interpreted as a metaphor for the larger fears of a society.""

esr9hk0,">If she didn't win that dancing competition then this movie would've been completely pointless

Lol woah. Okay where would I begin. This film went right over your head, no offense intended at all. Let me lend a hand.

Well, first of all she was going to win no matter what. The cult was going to make sure of that. It's a plan, the same plan they do every 90 years. They flatter you with flowers, adoration, structure, drugs and then they do their thing.

Second, the film is about grief. As you pointed out, people cried when she cried. They mirrored her emotions in a life for the character which was always filled with carrying the load. No matter what was happening, she was always taking the brunt of it whether that be in her relationship or her family.

Finally, she got closure because she had no (or limited) control over it.

Ari Aster called it a ""breakup movie"", which makes sense. It's about acknowledging grief, handling it by facing it head on instead of putting it off (for you or for others), and how it feels to just handle at least one bad thing in your life in the face of many challenges.

This was also fairly obvious throughout the movie I thought. It's nothing like Hostel 1.

3) Yes, it did end up being a sort of cathartic moment for her, hence her smile at the end, but that in no way means it was deserved or that those who empathize with her view her as right or the hero (and anyone who does is immature and missed the point of the movie). I do empathize with her, but I also recognize her decision for what it was: the last of her mental capacity essentially melting away. She was still pretty drugged at this time, most likely; she has been through *a lot* not only in the last few days alone, but then with what had happened to her family months before (the emotional aftermath of which she has suppressed for the entire movie and never allowed herself to properly deal with); and she now realizes that everyone else she came there with has been ritualistically killed in gruesome ways. She's lost her damn mind.

Grief plays a major part too (if you've seen Hereditary you're on the right lines) and personally I find that more distressing/emotionally draining to watch than any slasher/ghost/jump scare horror.

Thankfully not a problem I've had to deal with, but it was a very well-written relationship in trouble. One where they both clearly had contributed to the issues and were getting good advice from friends. The problem was that they never sat down and honestly talked about it. That would have likely revealed a fairly mutual breakup where they could acknowledge that neither of them were getting their needs met.

Maybe this is just an example of those dependent relationships that should have broken up a year ago.

Movie certainly dragged the ending and could have been more ambiguous. My example: we KNEW the couple and two guys who went missing at dinner were dead.

You're right that a relationship with Dani would be difficult.  We even know that Christian was discussing ending the relationship prior to her family's death.  What was the better thing to do:  stay with Dani to comfort her through her tragedy or be honest and leave her to grieve alone?

The story was about Dani though, and we're to see it through her eyes.  If we sympathize too much with Christian then the final scene isn't seen as a cleansing of Dani's afflictions, it's seen as a murder, and Dani as a villain.

esnq77d,"Eh, that seems like a huge stretch to me.

Was it Pelle or Will Poulter who said that to him? That definitely seems like something Poulter’s character would say. And obviously Pelle knew what would happen once they got to Sweden anyway.

I viewed the gas mask/duct tape as Dani’s sister’s commitment to suicide. Even though she’s bipolar and wanting to die, the body’s natural reaction to death is to fight it, second guess yourself. In the documentary about jumpers from Golden Gate Bridge, they do some interviews with survivors who say after they’ve jumped “I made a huge mistake, all my problems can be fixed.” Nothing but regret for trying. The duct tape/gas mask is to ensure the job gets done. 

As far as the secret relationship, Pelle has romantic feelings towards her, as made obvious by the gift and holding her hand when she has the meltdown on her bed, basically telling her Christian doesn’t make her feel like she’s at “home.” Which isn’t wrong, Christian was already checked out of the relationship before Dani’s family died. He had to stay with her for a while afterwards out of guilt and not wanting to be a total douchebag. 

The themes are definitely isolation, and dealing with grief. I think the car nightmare was more her own fears of being isolated, it was a manifestation of how alone she felt.

This commune is implied to be at least gaining more popularity through contemporary immigration paranoia: the Halsingland banner on the road in is cautioning people to vote against against mass immigration, and according to my [authoritative 7 minutes on Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%84ttestupa), modern day historians now believe the suicide ritual is apocryphal - it never was an actual practice. The commune in the movie likely cobbled their rituals together from some gobbledygook racial purity cultural preservationist movement in the region, maybe going back a few generations or so, but with no authentic ties to actual ancient practices, and are using the current political bullshit to grow their ranks.

They deceive and conceal the fatal punishments they’re giving out to Simon, Connie, Josh, and Mark from the rest of the outsiders, which isn’t anything anybody would take as a happy innocent practice of some well-meaning people cherishing their long-established cultural beliefs.

My takeaway is that the commune is a bunch of murderous loons who are capitalizing on ignorance and paranoia to sustain their racially purified bullshit utopia.

* The frequency of the big feast, not the may queen or other activities

* The frequency of the sacrifices, in which case Pelle’s burning parents got burnt up in some other context

* Deception by the commune for the outsiders to put on airs about how ancient their little commune is. There is other evidence in the film that they don’t legitimately hold the heritage they’re claiming.

Someone else also pointed out that the name ‘Pelle’ is a Swedish equivalent of ‘Peter’, who acted as an emissary for Christianity following Jesus’ death/ascension, trying to gain converts. Besides that name nicely suiting Pelle’s role in the commune, I think it also means that Pelle originally came from a family outside the commune, since members would not likely give Christian names to their children.

If that is the case, that Pelle came from an outsider family, it could be that they died outside the commune and someone brought him in after the fact, or that the 90 year thing is deception, and his parents were sacrificed by the commune 20-something years ago.",c7y18a

You don't have to like a movie to do that, by the way. And even if you couldn't be bothered to try and get anything from it or figure out what it might be trying to say: fine. Okay. There a lot of movies and things that I feel that way about, so I think that's fair enough. But don't then try and put others down because they might've gotten something from it that you didn't. Why does that make you better than them? Chill out, man. You can have your opinion without trying to shit on others.

He didn't because he was lazy (avoiding his thesis) and waffling (""What if I change my mind?"") and, probably, wanted to retain access to sex with her.

Did folks just miss Florence Pugh's insanely strong performance during those panic attack scenes where she curls up on herself and silently heaves, where the only sound of her grief that she can let out is her breathing? Was the scene where the Harga girls cry and yell with her not the most powerful scene in the movie to you, a scene where she finally, for the first time, has a community to fully empathize with and welcome her emotional expression?

Completely agree with this! You go in not trusting anyone and expecting the characters to understand the threat and then do something about it. But no, nothing really happens. It's just boring all the way through. There's gratuitous gore and nudity that doesn't seem to serve any purpose except to add to the weirdness of everything.

> And why Dani chooses to kill Christian and then smiles about it in the end just seems like a riddle posed to the audience that we're supposed to go home and solve.

This part I disagree. It felt very obvious that that was the only thing for her to do. She was lost and disconnected from the world. Her relationship with Christian was practically gone. Once she saw him in the orgy, she realized it was over. But then she understood that these people were her new family. They shared her panic attack and gave her the emotional support and understanding she so desperately needed. Burning Christian was simply a way for her to cut ties from her previous life and be reborn. But this was so obviously stated that you saw it half-way through the movie. There are absolutely no surprises.

And this is related to how the movie disconnects the audience from the events. There is nothing for the viewer to identify with. We're just forced to sit there and observe this weird and frustrating sequence of events. We know something is wrong, but there characters just carry on oblivious to it. We want them to escape and leave, but they never do. It's boring and frustrating.

Yes, she was betrayed by her last, only solid connection to anything in this world so she killed him. And it's not supposed to make you feel good. It's a sick movie with a sick ending. 

>I also saw people saying it showed her having a real family at the end. So are are supposed to root for her at her having ""happy ending"" but she is not even the same character who was at the start of the film and her character change made no sense at all just because she did some sort of drugs and performed in some sort of weird culture no one ever heard of. Only if the director had hidden some sort of metaphor for everything these characters chose to do this film absolutely makes no sense.

It *is* a metaphor, man. The whole thing is, in a way, a metaphor for how people lose their connections to their family, either through alcoholism or abuse or death or whatever, and end up in cults. Her boyfriend was her last connection to anything in this world and when she lost that, she snapped. She had nothing left but her new ""family"".

The doors to her parents bedroom were taped up so the poisonous gas wouldn’t escape.

I read an article after viewing that mentioned how the themes are primarily codependency and trauma.",c7y18a
et0zn8g,"I think, in the end, Dani displays a tendency to become embroiled in destructive, co-dependent relationships. She has one with her sister, she has one with Christian, and eventually, she has one with the cult. She's what is often called ""anxiously attached."" She can't seem to leave Christian any more than she can't seem to leave the festival even when it starts to feel unsafe. She just wants so desperately to not feel so alone in the world, which she very much is after the death of her entire family. We see three destructive, co-dependent relationships in her life, starting with her sister, moving onto Christian and ending with the cult, each one feeding into the next. She wants to feel, as Pelle puts it, ""held."" The way this cult functions, with lots of rules but no boundaries, is the kind of thing a deeply traumatized, anxiously attached person would easily be absorbed into. The cult does for her what Christian and even her own family could never do. If Dani were a different type of person, she may have dumped Christian and therefore never gone to Sweden and ended up where she ended up.  


Christian, for his part, is a pretty classic avoidant person. He needs Dani to feel powerful, to feel superior, which is why he wonders if he will ""regret it"" if he ""lets her go"" (I think those were his words) when talking to his friends in the bar. He gaslights her, constantly making her question her own instincts even though her instincts are pretty spot-on (about him and just about everything else). Avoidant people desire intimacy the same as everyone else, but fear being subsumed by it and therefore need to feel they are controlling/limiting the level of intimacy in the relationship. He can't be who HE is without an anxious person to attach to him, he would likely feel lonely and empty without her. And, in the end, he is consumed, both metaphorically by being stuffed inside of a bear skin, and then literally, by the fire, at the hands of the woman with whom he had this destructive relationship.",c7y18a

et0mewm,"I think the loss of her biological family is only linked to the festival in that it determines how she will process the events at the festival - it defines her state of mind and the trauma she has to find a path out of. She needs a new family, and her boyfriend sure as shit ain’t it - gotta burn that down",c7y18a
et0ydt0,"Missed your edit. I saw a direct connection between the sister’s suicide and its meaning to Dani and the supposed meaning of the elder suicides to the commune at the festival. The commune presents themselves as a family where the suicide of elders is imbued with a significance, welcoming, and happiness that was not at all found in Dani’s family situation - to them it’s a giving of life. 


We don’t know the details, but it’s suggested that Dani might be the only one in her family who sees and wants to solve her sister’s pain. It may be that the parents saw it as pure attention-getting; something that was an obstacle getting in the way of everybody’s happiness. Dani’s sister’s act is a suicide and a double homicide in modern secular society, but I think it would be seen more like 3 murders if it happened in the Midsommar colony - the parents (elders) did not give their lives, and the sister gave hers up in her youth, all acts that would likely be transgressions against the commune’s belief system, if we can believe anything they say about their world.


Dani’s original family, her boyfriend, and the other Americans treat each other in ways that are the antithesis of the supposed values of the colony, which to Dani more resemble the kind of commitment she wants from family.


So, I didn’t see the sister’s suicide/murder as arbitrary - it’s included specifically to contrast with the elder suicide in the commune.

The sister texted Dani likely as another plea for help.",c7y18a

Either they were sacrifices in their earlier years or they died in a random fire.  I'd guess the former.",c7y18a
et3nhp3,"I’m wondering if they did that to trick the two volunteers into compliance with the ritual (by promising no pain) until after the doors were shut, the fires were lit, and it was too late.

The elders of the community—the man at the table who clapped at drugged Christian, the ones administering the sap, the woman butt-pusher at the weird sex scene, and the two cliff-jumpers—certainly seemed a lot less smiley and a lot more “let’s just get this over with” serious about the ceremonies.

et3xycr,"I think the fact that their society has not been properly documented and they operate in total seclusion would help with the cover up. Plus, no one would actually believe that a cult would go to such lengths in this day and age so it is not like they would be looking for that as a possible solution. It's the whole Occam's Razor thing. Moreover, from a forensic perspective, the Harga burned most of the evidence to ash. It should be really hard to find any remnants of the dead as they should be all burned away aside from the bone which should be intact but crumbly and easily shattered with a mortar and pestle or smashing two rocks together. I could totally see this cult grinding up the bones and ingesting them into their own bodies as some sort of ritual. I am sure they will also dispose of and burn the clothes/belongings. 

So then, what is left? All Pelle needs to say is that his friends came for the festival and that he decided to stay with his family afterwards but they wanted to explore the rest of Sweden and left. And that's *if* anyone can really find this farm to question Pelle. It doesn't seem like his friends even told people exactly where they went. The only evidence we have of them telling anyone is at the party when Mark tells someone they were going to visit a hippie commune at a yodeling farm. That's not much to go on especially since no one really seems to know where this farm is exactly and they have to be walked through the woods to get there.",c7y18a

Other than Dani, everybody was planning this for quite a while. Christian mentioned that he had ""been wanting to go"" and Josh was going there specifically because his thesis was on Midsommar. The other guys were sort of tagging along because it was a cool ""trip with the boys"" kind of thing. Pelle was their tour guide since it was his native land and his family they were going to visit, so it makes sense that he would be controlling their travel plans. 

The ritual suicide is part of the culture they came to study - Josh knew what the Atestupan was when Pelle mentioned it. They went along with it because they're anthropology students and they're guests in another culture. As for the people disappearing...yeah, drugs. We also don't know the exact time frame when they started to go missing, since the daylight never changed. At that point Dani and Christian weren't in any position to question or retaliate anyway.",c7y18a
et9lcyk,">then at the first signs of dangers (ritual suicide, people disappearing) they just kind of go with it.. I guess maybe the drug influence was strong by then?

I thought Aster handled the ritual suicide very well. Connie & Simon clearly can't handle it, Josh and Christian are interested from an anthropological perspective, Mark is the comedic relief, etc. 

Dani was the only one concerned about Connie & Simon, she was constantly pulled into other activities and distracted. 

Also, remember the entire time at the commune happens in the span of what, 3 days? Mark and Josh disappear during the same day. The cultists put it back on Christian and Dani since their book is missing (likely just a story they made up) which is pretty manipulative. I believe that same day is where Dani is chosen as the Maid Queen and Christian performs in the sex ritual.

 Hereditary, I think iI bought the hype and was disappointed that it wasn’t all that fresh or ‘new’ in most mechanics and tropes.
 Both films excel at human drama and building mystery, but ultimately both for hem have a ton of horror film tropes(I didn’t think hereditary did much beyond the demon possession genre we haven’t seen before) and Midsommar didn’t do much beyond the folklore cult genre here, but I think the predictability of midsommar was intentional, it’s just crafting how you got there.

I like both films, and as a director I’m much more excited to see his next work, than most others, even with disappointments.

In the end as much as I thought her bf needed to grow a spine and stop pretending to be a ‘nice guy’, I didn’t think he deserved that, but then I think horror movies teach us that  almost any character flaws are  justification for our desire to see horrific death :).

They've got to finish studying for their finals, take the tests themselves, and then school's out for good. The party has come just at the right time, and is just what Christian needs; right up until the point his sister commits suicide in an upstairs bathroom. Exams and graduation completed, Sofie's unexplained suicide is still affecting everyone concerned, especially Christian, who is convinced that Sofie was trying to tell him something before she killed herself at the party. But life has to go on, and before they all have to split up and go their own way Christian and his friends decide to go on their traditional trip to Sweden to celebrate midsummer for one last time. Although the group's usual rituals in connection with the midsummer trip aren't the same without Sofie, everyone does their best to enjoy themselves. And when Christian's long held, yet unrequited feelings for the beautiful Trine finally appear to be reciprocated, it looks like the trip is going to turn out just fine anyway. But then Christian discovers that someone - or something - has decided that Sofie's suicide should not go unexplained - and one night he wakes up with the feeling that Sofie is in the room with him. Has Sofie really come back? Or are Christian's feelings of guilt and sorrow over Sofie's apparently meaningless death making him imagine things? The dreadful truth is lurking in the dark shadows cast by the fir trees in the Swedish forest. The trip turns out to be like nothing they've experienced in the past - and the lives of those who get to drive back home after midsummer is over will never be the same again.

Doesn't sound too similar at all. The only similarity is that it involved a sister's suicide in the beginning and takes place during midsummer. 

Also, I don't mean this in a condescending way, but you/your friends know that midsummer is an actual real-life thing, right? Like with the maypole and flowers and everything. It's still a major holiday to this day in some European countries. Similar to something like Mardi Gras.

Jordan Peele became an overnight horror sensation with Get Out giving middle finger to those who've been making films in the said genre for years. Then he tried cashing it in with Us and that turned out to be a garbage ass movie.

Same with Ari Aster, Hereditary broke new records in the horror genre and the name Ari Aster and horror became synonymous but having watched Midsommar last night, I am like what in the world?!?

Get Out had elements of mystery, sprinkled with just the right amount of horror and it was a commentary on racial inferiority. Hereditary was depressing, a film where the family was seen battling with grief and thus, becoming more susceptible to evil. The latter two products by the directors are absolute shite.

f3lwuot,"I found myself a little confused too if I liked the movie or not, but I think I can answer some of your “plot holes”

1) Dani’s family dying *definitely* added more than just unstable emotions. She’s an orphan. From what we’ve seen, her only family is Christian, who’s clearly not a good boyfriend or friend since he literally stole that dudes thesis and acted like he didn’t. Dani desperately unconsciously needed family, and the cult, you can argue, gave her that in the end. I thought it was pretty heavy handed that they were her new family, which may be the biggest theme of the movie. 

2) Pelle’s drawings: I mean, I doubt this was a big plot point but it was clear from the beginning that Pelle had an eager interest in Dani. If I recall correctly, he was drawing flowers at the end or maybe one of the sacrifices. I think he just drew stuff from the cult since their whole village had tons of creepy cartoons, drawings and symbols. Seems like everyone in the cult will draw at some point. Hell, their disabled “leader” or whatever just drew all the fucking time anyway.

3) The Dani hallucinating that she’s a plant was pretty clear again that she was joining the community. Pelle says something about the ground breathing early on and then she sees grass on her. It happens again in the movie when she’s beginning her final moments of joining her new family. Nature was also breathing at times throughout the movie. Like, plants on their clothing were slowly breathing and the trees around the area too. 

4) That wasn’t Mark who had his body flayed, it was Simon. What they did to him was something that Vikings would do to torture captured people I believe. They were likely punishing him for intruding on their ceremony and trying to leave. Definitely not just shock value. 

5) I think the sleeping pills were just there to help Dani sleep since she was in such a stressful emotional state. Nothing much there imo. 

6) I’m not sure what to think about Pelle’s parents dying. They clearly aren’t killed in a sacrifice since they only do it every 90 years, so I think Pelle’s parents might have been killed by the cult and he taken as a child. It’s insinuated that the baby that was constantly crying was stolen from its mother. 

7) The disabled character was there to show how the cult was...wrong in their beliefs. I too expected more scenes from him, but once they described that he was created on purpose, and the student looks at him like he’s crazy, made a lot of sense. He’s us in that scene (the viewer) as we realize that these people are actually godless and create fucking mentally disabled people to make yo their religion. I know it’s weird/frustrating, but it definitely has to do with the plot. 

Hope I helped! I liked the movie, but not as much as I thought I would and it was definitely not what I expected.",c7y18a

Throughout the movie Pelle is constantly talking about this community becoming his family after he lost his parents (just like Dani), so hence her smiling at the end when she feels like she has one again with this community. The fact that shes becoming the plant is her slowly becoming one with the earth/community since they put so much emphasis on trees/grass/nature etc. You pretty much understand the part with his parents possibly being sacrificed so i think the surprise value is that fact that you put that together by the end of the movie.

From a few interviews I've read, Ari Aster is upfront about the fact that he's operating within a specific genre (folk horror) and that he isn't too concerned about rewriting the playbook on that front. His focus is on the relationship breakdown aspect of the film, as well as on the journey the characters take to their inevitable ends. Once you know that Aster himself isn't trying to shock in that department, it makes sense that he would have fun 'spoiling' major plot points through the murals, the familiar pagan setting etc.

It has it's moments, and the beginning has to be one of the most unsettling things I've ever sat through in a film, coupled with Pugh's incredible acting in those scenes, it had me really anticipating a build on it for the rest of the film. But after that it just fell flat for me. Predictable, too much exposition and not getting to see any of the deaths, super drawn out in some respects, and the climax was just over the top, too long, and awkward to the point of laughter.

Let's not forget she's also being manipulated to hell and back by multiple other parties.

He's not a perfect victim, but by God he's a victim.",c7y18a
esw3q8q,"Having watched Midsommar much more carefully than Hereditary, I'm actually a bigger fan of this movie,

1. Reminders of Dani's grief were pretty consistent throughout the entire movie, so I actually thought the movie was constantly returning to that point. Anything more overt would have felt heavy-handed to me. 
2. I think the ending is supposed to be bittersweet. Christian's character has a similar duality: as scummy as he was, I think he was more cowardly than malicious. Also, what cinched his death was actually him being raped while on drugs, then being sentenced by his girlfriend while she was on drugs. The moral behind his death isn't black and white, and the same can be said for the ending. 
3. I agree with this, but I also give it some leeway because it serves the purpose of alienating viewers. I interpreted the goal of the movie to be introduce viewers to something completely twisted, gross, deranged, etc... and then by the end have us understand it and maybe even click with parts of it. While Dani explores her grief, viewers explore their disgust. 
4. Dani's journey is kind of straightforward imo. More interesting to me was how I myself felt through the movie. The scenes at the end when the women started mirroring each other was when I thought, ""ohh, I get it."" I then thought ""wow I'm actually sympathizing with this cult"" at the same time when Dani might have been thinking the same. Playing with feelings of grief, insecurity, curiosity, alienation, disgust, horror, and even humor is the whole point. I read that Aster was happy to hear viewers laugh during an early screening - this kind of confirms my suspicion that the story off-screen is just as important as what happens on-screen. 
5. Agreed, it does drag. I appreciate it taking its time, but that is more appropriate for earlier parts of a movie. 
6. Agreed. Mark was completely one-dimensional and I disliked his role in the film. 
7. I think the parallels to Hereditary cheapened the experience while I was watching. But on reflection, they were very intentional. Both movies explore grief in different contexts with different conclusions. I think both essentially ask ""what happens when you can't grieve properly"", but Hereditary veered more into slasher film territory at the end. Everything after the family implodes is irrelevant to that question. It's still interesting to analyze within the story itself, but I think Midsommar explores the question in a way that's more relevant to life.",c7y18a

esqwrr1,"They both say that the thesis wasn't something they had gone to their universities with yet. So no, the colleges haven't been officially informed of where they are or whatever. One would imagine that someone had posted on social media, informed their parents where they were going, etc. but remember that there wasn't any reception in the area and they all were basically acting like it was gonna be Burning Man With A Real Cult so, their families would've probably assumed they'd be hard to reach for a while.",c7y18a
esy388g,"I felt like there were two implications from her sister's actions (beyond being a means for Dani to lose her family): first, that Dani has had to be accommodating in all of her relationships. Her needs aren't allowed to be front and center because she's always had to cater to her sister's emotions (she's a caretaker--even at the expense of her own well being). At the commune, however, she finds a place where her emotions are valued and she blooms. The second implication (although not fleshed out) seemed to be that there was darkness in both girls from the start. Dani was used to turning her darkness toward herself but finally turns it outward at the end of the film.",c7y18a
esxzhoo,"I think it’s to do with how grief permeates Dani’s life. We already know she’s desperate and clinging to her relationship, we already know a Christian wants to leave, neither of them are going to cut the cord. The script describes Christian in the opening scene where she’s sobbing on the couch as looking trapped, presumably feeling like he can’t leave now. For plot reasons that’s presumably part of the reason he feels he has to invite her to Sweden. 

In terms of Dani- it leaves her extremely vulnerable and susceptible to influence. The scene where Pelle latches onto her in the apartment and then again at Midsommar to tell him he shares grief too- it’s extremely manipulative imo rather than empathetic. He’s not saying ‘let’s share this grief together’ he’s telling her it with the context of wanting her to get from his ‘family’ what he knows she isn’t getting from her relationship with Christian. I personally didn’t like the scene where Dani was screaming and crying and the others were along with her, just because it felt like I had gotten the message by that point already, but compare that to the scene at the start where she’s screaming and crying and Christian is sat there looking vacant, she’s seeing this as her getting the support she needs, when actually she’s being manipulated into staying. And her sisters death is at the bottom of all that.",c7y18a
esy10z6,"Her sister has everything to do with the story, on multiple levels. The entire arc is basically how she lost one “extreme” family and then found another. There’s also the angle of the journey being a twisted healing experience from the pain her sister caused. It also to a lesser extent, explains somewhat why she was willing to stay with a mostly uncaring boyfriend, and that was that she was used to being treated badly by her sister, so an apathetic boyfriend was almost an improvement.",c7y18a
esyfzg5,"The commune puts emphasis on cycles and making the personal sacrifice/choice to end one's life when it's reached it's point of productivity/purpose. Besides the factors about mental health and grief, another connection between Dani's suicidal sister and the movie is that Dani's sister took any opportunity for a natural death or unpredictable circumstances that might lead to death away from the parents while getting the choice to end her own life. Dani's sister planned and executed how death would happen. By committing the murder-suicide, Dani's sister robs Dani opportunity for any mediation, closure, or acceptance -- her sister was able to make *her* choice, but now Dani struggles with the loss and the imbalance in her own life. She doesn't have a community for grief, she doesn't have anyone to really hold her or lift her, and she might also feel powerless or helpless because the death was so beyond her realm of control. Someone as emotionally vulnerable like Dani might be more susceptible to the commune since they offer set boundaries and predictability for what happens ""next"" -- even if it means, y'know, killing people.

et9k9g6,"> So what was the point of him copying the other guy in writing the thesis? 

What I got from that was exactly what Josh said: it's lazy and leechy. Not because I believe Christian was intending to let Josh do all the work, but by simply choosing the same thesis topic as Josh, he didn't have to decide on one himself, which I think really just plays into Christian's overall character because he's an incredibly wishy-washy guy. He had been wanting to break up with Dani for *over a year* prior to the start of the film, but couldn't decide to--or get up the emotional energy to--actually do it, which ended up forcing him to stay with her once she had the family tragedy. His lack of decision-making and lack of passion I think are kind of his two big defining characteristics, and are what ultimately lead to his downfall, in a way. At the very least, it's what makes him such a bad partner to Dani and friend to Josh. 

>Dude wasn’t even a bad dude

The sound design is incredible, as is the cinematography, but it felt like a collection of individual scenes that worked well on their own but ultimately dislodged the tone and pace. It's a genuinely hilarious movie at times, intentionally so, but that gets muddled with the rest of the film and that careful line between shocking and absurd gets blurred too often. The sex scene at the end is a prime example of this. It adds a nice tonal juxtaposition at times but it leaves very little room for the movie to breath, and I just couldn't get engaged through most of the second half.

et9ocgc,"> Can someone explain to me how Dani's family dying in the start had anything to do with the rest of the movie? 

Not going to say anyone else's explanations so far are ""right"" or ""wrong,"" but here's what I got from it:

This movie, much like Hereditary, criticized the way we deal with grief, loss, our emotions in general, communication, and anything generally too ""messy."" Whether it's a criticism of modern society, Western society, both, neither, I'm not sure. But what I got from both films is that there can be brutal consequences (which were obviously taken to impossibly hyperbolic extremes in both films) to not properly dealing with your emotions, not properly communicating with those around you, and not expressing proper empathy or passion for the people and things you love. 

So how do the deaths at the beginning play into this? Well, for starters, Dani's sister's threats weren't really taken seriously by either Dani or Christian (mostly by Christian, but Dani also tried to brush them off, as she hoped they weren't serious). This is said in the movie to be because her sister has made these kinds of threats many times before, and also has bipolar disorder, which is relevant because this can be taken as another criticism of how we often deal with mental health issues: by invalidating them, and by pretending their not real or serious, oftentimes tragically pushing people to act out to show people how serious they are (not that other people are to blame when that happens, but this film tries to illustrate the dangers of handling these extremely sensitive situations the wrong way, namely, by not dealing with them). Then, other than a brief scene the night of the deaths, Dani is shown to be suppressing her feelings for the entire move, never letting herself truly feel (or show) the despair, grief, and anger she's clearly holding inside. 

I could go on about why that's bad, and why it ultimately results in how the story plays out, but I think that kind of speaks for itself. Hopefully, I've kind of given some insight as to why and how (I believe) the deaths in the beginning play a role in the story, in Dani's character development, and in the overall themes of the film.",c7y18a

Sorry, but willingly, agreeably, choosing someone to be sacrificed for a cults ritual is indeed wrong. Her boyfriend was a jerk, but you're inane if you are suggesting she's not out of her marbles by the end of the film.

If you'll defend Dani for choosing for Christian to be burned alive, then you should defend the cult for killing all they killed as well, as Christian and his friends did nothing to warrant what happened",c7y18a

The worst though was the jumping scene in the script makes no mention of the hammer until the guy lands on his ankles, while in the film, the hammer is being held in frame for pretty much every single shot, as if to say, ""we're gonna have to bash a head in.""",c7y18a

et2wqgw,"I think there was a fine line that Aster walked. He didn't want to spell out everything, but the clues are all in place. Dani was in a dysfunctional family, so she felt estranged from the beginning. She was also anxious (she takes Ativan at one point). Then, suddenly, all of her family was dead. She turns to her boyfriend, and while he goes through the motions, he doesn't exactly rise to the occasion of comforting her in her need. She is abandoned by her BF, who sleeps with the Swedish girl, and she hallucinates about being left behind. The cult welcomes her and she fits in.... then she REALLY fits in. When she is, at last, completely left alone with the cult, she finds a readymade (if also dysfunctional) family that not only accepts her, but makes her the May Queen.   


My question would be, what did the random learning of Swedish and the women screaming together (as they did during the sex scene) mean in context? Did it mean that she connected so well with the cult that she picked it up subconsciously? Was it a mushroom trip? Or was she fore-ordained to do exactly what she did? Did Pelle knowingly choose her because she was A) vulnerable and susceptible to groupthink, or B) she was already the May Queen, she just needed to be acknowledged (as in the end of Hereditary). I think back to the ending of ""The Wicker Man"" (to which this film obviously pays homage) where everything is carefully orchestrated to its inexorable climax.",c7y18a
et2vzvn,"Dani was not allowed to develop in the way you describe. She was isolated by grief, and her community in the States would not experience that grief with her. It makes sense, then, that her character development (for lack of a better term) jump starts when she is with the cult and experiences true empathy for the first time.



That is to say, you have pointed out character development, but then said it wasn't character development. I think perhaps it was just character development of a different sort.



The whole point of the movie is to explain her smile at the end, and I think it does that quite well.",c7y18a

I didn't see it this way. He was too much of a coward to break it off with her 'a year back' when he really wanted , maybe out of fear of being seen as a bad person. He also gaslighted her big time during their fight after the party. I don't think he was necessarily intentionally abusive, but the relationship was dead in the water (apparently there were some scenes cut that showed up in the directors cut that emphasised this, on her part too she knew he was full of shit and didn't want to be with her anymore). The scene of him holding her while she's grieving after finding out her whole family is dead was so hard to watch b/c it seemed like he didn't know how to console her, except just sit there and have us, the viewers realise how awkward he felt knowing he wanted to end things. Contrast this to how her grief was a shared, living, breathing experience with the women at the festival - they felt what she felt, they WANTED to.

“In modern English, the term cult has come to usually refer to a social group defined by its unusual religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs, or its common interest in a particular personality, object or goal. This sense of the term is controversial and it has divergent definitions in both popular culture and academia and it also has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. It is usually considered pejorative.

In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults, saying that they arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices.”",c7y18a

* On the drive in with the long inverted tracking shot, the banner they drive under is urging people to vote to stop mass immigration in Halsingland

* After however many generations they have been operating and presumably bringing in outsiders, there are exactly zero brown or black skinned members

* The first commune member they are introduced to is clearly appalled that Josh would compare their cultural beliefs in a hermaphroditic natural deity with other cultures (I think Josh’s comparison was to an African culture?). I think he was appalled by both the fact of the comparison, and that it was coming from a Black man

...but I didn’t really find these facts to be working as allegory, really. To me, these, together with the commune’s murderous and deceitful behaviors, the obvious gender roles (that they also lie about - one of the members tells Christian that the roles people take in the commune are assigned based on their abilities) constitute a set of red flags that Dani is ignoring in her pursuit of closer, more empathetic relationships in her life.

etftvuw,"After the Attestupa scene, Simon and Connie freak out and want to leave. Simon disappears and the villagers tell Connie that he left the village already since there was limited space in his vehicle. Then Connie disappears.

Christian has the realization that one of the village women is after him. His friend Josh sees her put a love talisman under his mattress. At a meal, he realizes his meal has pubic hair in it. He drinks his drink which is colored red. She is placing love spells on him.

The partyboy who looks like Sid from Toy Story pees on a sacred tree that has the remains of the village's dead in front of it. One villager gets REALLY pissed about it. A girl that the partyboy fancies lures him away and the partyboy ends up going missing. Everyone thinks he's just off having fun with the girl. 

Josh (who went there to study the village as one part of his thesis) is told by Christian (main girl's boyfriend) that he has decided he wants to do his thesis on the village too. Josh gets pissed. 

Josh sees a sacred book that has writings in it. Despite being told by the villagers that pictures of it are not allowed, he sneaks into where its kept and starts taking pictures. A man wearing the partyboy's skin walks into the room. Josh is confused and he is hit on the head from behind.

Christian and Dani are the only ones left. The village make themselves out to be the victims by saying their sacred book has been stolen. (implying Josh probably stole it and ran away with it)

Dani drinks a drugged drink and takes part in an endurance competition where they all dance around a pole until there is 1 woman left standing. Dani begins to feel camaraderie with the women around her. Dani wins the event and is crowned the queen. While Christian watches, he is also given a drugged drink.

As a celebration, the village holds a feast for Dani where it is clear they all respect her. (and Christian is pushed to the side) Dani and Christian are both heavily drugged by this point.

Christian follows the girl who has been after him. He is taken to a room where she lies naked among a group of the naked village women. They do a humorous ritualistic song/dance as Christian has sex with the girl. 

Dani breaks away from her queen festivities to go investigate the room where Christian is. She peeks in and begins sobbing. The village women who had been with her follow her and begin sobbing in harmony with her.

Christian finishes having sex and gets horrified by what he's done. He runs out of the building and hides. He discovers Simon's body which has been carved and he has flowers stuffed in his eyes. A villager blows something in Christian's face that knocks him out.

Christian wakes up and is paralyzed. Dani stands in front of the village and is informed there must be sacrifices. She can either sacrifice Christian or pick another random sacrifice from the village. She chooses to sacrifice him.

Christian is stuffed into the corpse of a bear and placed in an empty building that had previously been off-limits to everyone. The corpses of the dead are placed in the room as well. 2 random villagers are chosen to complete the necessary amount of sacrifices that need to happen. The building is burned down as Christian lays paralyzed in the bear outfit. 

Dani watches and is initially horrified. She sobs and runs away. Then she notices the emotional/euphoric/manic reactions that the villagers are having to the sacrifice. She looks at the sacrifice again and smiles. She lost her family at the start of the movie, but she has found a new one.

esqidsj,"Same.  It makes me genuinely curious why the writer(s) went with the whole 90 years thing.  Do the rituals happen every year, but the community says it's rare to lure outsiders?  Is the 90's years thing simply to build tension in the movie?  They could have easily said the same exact rituals happen every year, and it wouldn't change the storyline...maybe just the tension.  It might make the rituals even more impactful knowing this is all going to happen again to more unsuspecting people.  


A random idea I had that might be lame is the community still tells the outsiders that the rituals happen only every 90s years, yet once they're dead, there's a pretty quick turn around and a new group of outsiders are immediately brought in.  So, the rituals are on an endless cycle, and the outsiders have no idea.  The movie would end with new people arriving thinking they're showing up for a rare festival.  But how terribly exhausting that would be for the community people haha.  Also, they'd have to stop executing their own people or numbers would become a problem.",c7y18a

esntrwe,"I’m open to that theory. Either twins Pelle and Ingmar were brought into the cult or born into it, but either way they had to recruit foreigners for sacrifice...guessing it had to do with their age and payback for staying in the community and giving back. So the more they recruit, the better chance they have of living. Ingmar recruited only two, so Pelle lives with his four offerings and Ingmar dies. Pelle never encouraged Christian to break up with Dani, she was always part of the recruitment.",c7y18a

For example, when Dani was dancing with the girls, the music that the band was playing was mixed into the soundtrack as if it was the score. We’re immersed into the music the way Dani is.

The way he gets the wailing screaming call right after he's talking about leaving her really hit home. In my relationship my ex's family didn't die or anything quite THAT fucked up but it always seemed like as soon as I was building up the courage to end things, another shoe dropped and I didn't feel like I could leave during such an awful vulnerable time for her, which can VERY easily make you resentful as fuck.",c7y18a

I don’t know, it’s a weird paradigm, grieving. There were so many random parts of Hereditary and Midsommar that made certain sections of my brain tingle. I would really like to know why those areas lit up to certain stimuli. I will say the final shot of the movie made the entire back of my brain completely light up, and give me shivers.

eszgmmt,"I think certain films - especially Aster's, both Hereditary and especially this - invite that kind of release of incredulous, horrified tension. Aster isn't afraid to let his films be both very emotionally brutal and very funny. Much of the comedy in Hereditary comes from Toni Collette and co.'s incredulous reactions as things get funkier and funkier, esp in her scenes with Ann Dowd. The same is true here but to a much sharper edge.

My theater went apeshit during the sacrifice sequence at the cliffs. I knew what was coming but that didn't make it any less horrific. As it just got worse and worse people alternated between horror and shocked laughter.

I think that kind of nervous release of tension through laughter is different than when, say, kids or hipsters try to laugh through any emotional scene in a film. The latter is tryhard ironic detachment, the former is a genuine reaction to a grueling symbiotic experience.",c7y18a

Do you think that tension was intentional, or is the moment supposed to something purely hopeful and cathartic for her?",c7y18a

esrlr8i,"I first watched it when it came out on Prime. The first time I was literally like “what the fuck did the end have to do with anything beforehand?!”. The second time I was blown away by the details I saw but dismissed and/or had no idea as to the relationship.

Things such as:
1) the footprints leading to the house as Charlie walks outside and sees her Grandma, but they never return
2) the cultist that smiles at her at the funeral is the same one Peter sees in the living room at the end...smiling the same way but different at the same time
3) the guys at the party watching the guillotiné video when Peter walks in - foreshadowing Charlie’s fate
4) the light (Paimon) barely noticeable during Joanne performing the seance as Annie looks under the table

I could keep going.

I think I watched it about 6 times in one week and caught something new each time. Hereditary is, and always will be, one of my top three favorites.

Also, was it just me or did the model of their house in Annie’s workshop not match up with their actual home? I looked at it numerous times and never could put it together. Maybe you or someone could help me with that?

Edit: Additionally, the crash when Peter is walking through the house at the end was Annie destroying the piano - which is where she gets the wire to sever her own head. As well as the cultist standing motionless of the attic after Peter shuts the stairs, which is how Paimon-possessed Annie gets into the attic while he has his back turned.",c7y18a

I also feel like movies that take themselves too seriously and don’t provide any moments of comedic relief end up having the opposite effect—Any moment that seems slightly unbelievable breaks all the tension in an unintended way, whereas letting people have a laugh and let down their guard then catches you by surprise at the next “scare”.",c7y18a

Dani wasn't likely taking antidepressants for a 4 year relationship going nowhere, or an occasional manic swing from her sister.

esvoact,"I agree. Ingemar was interested in her, so I assumed he wanted her in the group and that he could essentially just sacrifice/get rid of Simon and then get the girl.  It failed because Dani ended up coming along was a stronger fit (and perhaps because Ingemar underestimated the strength of Simon and Connie's relationship --- they seemed pretty in-sync and in love, unlike Dani in Christian who were clearly on the rocks).",c7y18a

At the end, they said Pelle would be rewarded for his unparalleled intuition. 

I doubt they’d be the only two of that pilgrimage age though, so maybe they just take turns every year lol.",c7y18a

I feel like the movie was trying to show it as cheating, and as a further denigration of Christian's character, and I think audiences generally will accept that...but it is quite explicitly a rape scene, and that affected my feelings about the ending. I cannot decide whether that was something that Ari Aster intended or not. 

I just saw the film last night, so I am still thinking about it, but it seems more like a problem with the screenwriting than a conscious choice to introduce ambiguity. My thoughts on that might change.",c7y18a

esriex5,"I totally get thinking Christian was a major douche with few redeeming qualities (other than not completely abandoning Dani in her grieving), but I just could not reconcile her choosing him to die.

They had hinted that he was having trouble figuring out what to write his thesis about, and it felt to me he just chose to write about Midsommar because it was right in front of him, not because he was passionate the way his friend was. And it just shows his pattern of doing extremely dickish things and not accepting responsibility for them, while making the other person feel like they’re overreacting.",c7y18a

He had every right to want out of the relationship. Then the tragedy happened, and he knew he was stuck. I don't get how people see Dani as anything  less than an emotional, psychological, and physical  monster by the end.

I was thinking about how when Mark was saying the sister was just calling for attention and just doing it again. Usually, that is not something you do. When someone is suicidal or has mental issues you try to take them seriously even if they might be crying wolf, so his reaction at that point gave him some credit.

My reading on it was that they had the perfect number of outsiders to sacrifice, and by chance, someone who lost her family and might fit perfectly into the cult is coming along too.

He was tricked into thinking that he was going to have a painless sacrifice, but instead he ends up suffering greatly.

I think the film intentionally misdirects the audience into thinking that the message is ""culture is relative."" I think the real takeaway is that the commune is doing some fucked up shit and that it's okay to call them out for doing some fucked up shit. I think it's also asking the audience ""what does *your* culture do for tradition's sake that's truly fucked up?""

People, throughout history all the way through today, have done some really messed up stuff in order to support their religion. And what has it all led to? Absolutely nothing. Burning witches, sacrificing animals, suicide bombings...none of those actions have led to a moment of justification. 

The commune believes some wacky stuff and does some really messed up stuff to attempt to satisfy those wacky beliefs, but none of it actually does anything other than severely torture and kill people. Hell, they even have a line in the film about how they're making up their sacred text as they go along!

When Christian approaches him his eyes fly open, then Christian turns around to see the British guy (forgot his name) has been hung upside down by rope being strung through his Achilles heels.

There are a lot of more subtle differences as well. Connie sees her boyfriend being dragged off into the woods, for example. She tries to warn Christian and Mike that these people are ""evil"" but they don't listen, and Dani is much more suspicious and insistent that this is a cult and that they should leave.

I can understand that. Dani is clingy and dumps a lot of her troubles on him-she takes but does she give? And then he feels trapped that he can’t leave her after her sister’s suicide and murder of the parents because how can he abandon her now? I can understand that too. He certainly doesn’t deserve Dani’s betrayal to murder him. I think the relationship is unhealthy for both of them, it’s hurting both of them.

The flow of the story gave them VERY little time to react to their predicament. But after both Josh AND Mark were gone.. Id have probably been sweating. It was too late of course by then. They were screwed when they passed that wooden gate.

Now a forced ritual drowning? In broad daylight? Well, there were like two large protracted screams from the distance I think. She could have been tossed in afterwards. 

Also the village men seem to hang in the film's background/peripheral, the elders and women front and center, while the men take care of the evil things. If they had the time to flay open and torture Simon, then they had time drown Connie.

I do think it's sort of a misstep the movie gave us 'reasons' for the demise of the characters.. Mark pissing on the tree, Josh snooping, Christian and his infidelity... Like... They were doomed from the beginning, kinda makes me curious how things were planned/would have gone down had the Americans behaved themselves. What the village's plan was... Or if they winged it?

""the idiot did What? Urinated? Fuck let's take care of him now..""

Very disturbing watching the villagers just utterly LIE to them about the missing people, the fake empathy. Connie's pre demise talk especially... How the tone of the elder's voice was just like ""ok ok ok.. Yeah.. Well listen he's waiting for you. Just hop in the truck. He'll be back for you""

Also masterful move to convince Christan that Josh probably left and took their book when he just ""disappeared"". Their anthropology fight drew them further in. I think it's implied since Pelle was in for the long hunt (befriending them, getting trust, etc) that I'm SURE the village knew A LOT about them before they even arrived in the country.

People’s positive reactions to the ending have been in my mind, and I think it demonstrates how people fall for these cults. Scary.

And they obviously made Pele like this intentionally. The attractive cult hippie who uses faux-empathy, but who will abandon you as soon as you go against the cult / his desires of you (as seen by what they did to Simon). He’s just as one-dimensional and as pig-headed as the boyfriend. All these women including Dani are clear victims to systematic abuse at the hands of a cult with fake scripture that is used to keep people down. Yet the quick emotional release of some surface level empathy has people convinced this was a happy ending for Dani and that the cult truly cares. I walked out truly terrified and sad for Dani.

I think it's important here to remember that both Christian and Josh are PHD students. These are the things they read about and study. Josh was there for his thesis and Christian was ""inspired"" by the attestupan to co-write a thesis on the Harga. Their reaction to the attestupan and the subsequent explanation of the ritual by Siv was in line as to how these group of people would react. 

As for Dani staying, I think it was literally rooted in the fact that she didn't want to leave Christian -- the last person she actually has a connection with. Of course, in the analysis sense, one could say that Dani didn't leave or overreact because she has experienced brutal deaths of people closest to her. 

I read an analysis here in reddit re: Dani's understanding of death in both the outside world and the Harga. In the Harga, people view death (suicide) as something beautiful and that their grief and feelings are shared within the community. In the outside world, death (suicide) is something sinister and ugly where grief is not shared. Those who grieve often isolate theirselves so as to not burden other people.

Also why sacrifice young people? Wasn’t the point that old people hit a certain age and that’s when they go? Also why was Christian inside a bear? And why did they need to recruit people from so far away? 

And than we have Dani. She goes from someone  empathic to literally killing her boyfriend after he is essentially drugged and rapped. I mean at what point does that turn happen? She never snaps out of her drugged state and realize she may not have fully understood the situation? Are we as an audience suppose to be on her side after she chooses to have her boyfriend killed in a horrific manner because he was drugged and had sex with someone?

I just think he wasnt handling the main characters situation well, which WOULD be shitty, except we get the clue at the beginning that she had been going through it with her sister for well over a year. The dude just wasn't prepared for dealing with over a years worth of that stuff. Not the greatest, I know, but we also get a hint its REALLY taking its toll on him whether he is aware or not. We get this through the fact that he was stressed near the beginning about not even having started his thesis, and he is clearly stressed that he hadnt even picked a subject, which tells us he should have picked it awhile ago. The dude was clearly emotionally and mentally spent, and he definitely was in need of a recharge. That is NOT his fault. It can happen to anybody. Mental health effects us whether it is convenient or not. We have to take care of ourselves BEFORE we can take care of others, and he never allowed himself to do that.

He did cheat on her too but in his defense he was drugged out of his mind, terrified and unsure of what was going on.

The reveal of Dani's family's murder/suicide set the tone for this for me. It just kept slowly showing more and more, and although I _knew_ what had happened to the family, and that was really clear even from her sister's message, the way the movie revealed it to the audience was almost like how you would discover something like that in real life; very real, very graphic.

But it's really just a very shallow film that is pretty laid and bare on the plot with incredibly one dimensional characters that gain no development, no reason for us to care about them and react according to how the plot wants them to, not reality.

It sets in motion the mysterious disappearances of the guests by having the British couple freak out and decide to leave the commune.

Christian although being detached and overwhelmed by her problems, I would say it was fixable/amendable (dump and find a new one, talk seriously through, etc), this is a blip compared to other issues she is going through.
If we think that “she feels responsible for the dead of her family because she could have done something about it”, then just wait until she comes to her senses when she realizes that she witnessed a first suicide, a failed and assisted second one, the acceptance of her acquaintances being murdered and ultimately getting her boyfriend burnes alive...

I know a lot of people said her choosing him was harsh BUT look how obsessed they all were with the cult. Look how they just accepted really messed up shit.

I think the may pole scene was an example of that too, like the other commenters said, with gibberish.

esw83fx,"if nothing else, it's interesting to see the different reactions to the cult and to Dani's arc in this movie. A lot of people talk about it being about healing and finding a support system, and about the cult not really being that bad or just having different cultural values. I'm definitely in the camp of the cult being pretty bad, they regularly trick foreigners into coming there, drug them into impregnating their women, and then kill them, and I interpreted Dani ""finding support"" and ""finding a new family"" as the cult preying on an emotionally damaged and lost person and presenting them with the illusion of support and family to pull them into a murder cult lol. 

a lot of people bring up the guys being kind of indifferent to the ritualized suicide and how the characters bring up that it's just a different cultural belief, but i felt like the audience was only meant to agree with them to a point. like that their over-willingness to study the group and see them as a research subject helped lead them to be deceived and brutally murdered, because they were too busy being ""objective"" and taking the perspective of a silent observer to realize things like, hey, no matter what the beliefs here, it was super sketchy and weird for our exhange student friends to bring us to a live suicide/mercy killing. i've also seen people mention things like the americans/londoners only being killed for not respecting the beliefs, but like...these people were going to kill them from moment 1. 

I don't think they really cared about or felt Dani's pain, all of the shared emotion scenes struck me as the cult just doing it for the sake of tradition--I think the cult members ""believed"" they were really sharing each other's physical and emotional pains, but they were just forcing themselves to ""feel"" it because that was what they were raised to do it. 

Wasn't huge on the movie but it's interesting to see how people viewed it.",c7y18a

I hate going to theaters and spent the $15 to buy it off Amazon. Was so excited for it since Hereditary is probably my favorite horror movie and it was the same guy who made this.
 
And it was bad. So fucking bad. Nothing scary in the slightest. Extremely predictable. And characters doing extremely dumb things. The fact that Hereditary didn't have that was one of the reasons why I loved it. But here we got ""herp derp all the outsiders are disappearing 1 by 1... oh well let's just take the cult for their word and act like nothing is happening. Why yes! I would love to have some more unknown hallucinogenic drugs, thank you."" And that sex scene and synchronized breathing thing at the end? What the fuck was that? I would have been laughing my ass off at that if I wasn't so fucking pissed for having my expectations for this movie crushed. 
 
Really. I tried. I kept pausing and saying things like ""Okay okay, we're 1:15 into the movie. It's all build up. They're setting up something good and it'll get crazy soon, like Hereditary."" Until I just got to the point where I wanted it to end.

Asta is a bit indulgent because his favourite films are indulgent. He's a big fan of over the top, emotional performances. He strives for high drama over horror which is why so many horror fans feel let down, and it's why the horror aspect of Midsommar is predictable, Aster knows the genre is a cliche and so he's purposefully signposted those elements throughout, this is so you'll pay more attention to the meat of the film, which is Danni and Christians relationship and Danni's anxiety.",c7y18a

Maybe foreshadowing but just  one of those strong clues you know you should notice but don’t know why. 

Re: grooming. Not long term grooming like Pelle orchestrates the family’s death prior to the trip like some people are suggesting, but more like things coincidentally aligned — a particularly superstitious cult would find reason to make the connections and justify them, and then work hard to maintain whatever it is they saw and want. AA says it’s like a fairytale or folk tale. I don’t think there’s any intentionally supernatural or “true destiny” really happening, but more like characters who want to see connections finding them because they’re looking for them. It’s coincidental in-universe, but from a writing analysis it reaffirms how things are both chaotic and random in life and how events can just *happen* that make other things line up. But the *characters* who are vulnerable like Dani or fanatical like the cult would say it might have just been meant to be. And that gives them purpose for whatever actions they take. 

I didn’t think much of it when I saw it, just thought it a quirky line, but Dani mentions she’s a cancer and Pelle perks up and says he’s a Taurus. I have no knowledge of astrology, so I looked it up today and read a run of the mill compatibility summary: cancer and Taurus would be considered ideal or strongly suited matches. Cancers are emotional and strongly ruled by their feelings and environment, Taurus are more grounded and firm in whatever their beliefs. If you’re someone who puts no faith in astrology and think it’s cold reading, you might go: sure that sounds like them but it’s a nice coincidence. If you’re Pelle or someone who deeply believes in the connection of nature, etc. you might jump at that as a sign from *something* that this is “the right path” to keep going and that Dani is the right one (for him, for the community) or whatever. Pelle ends up having that crown at the end for his own intuition.

f81j5sj,"I am not sure that we are supposed to see him as sympathetic, but I definitely think that’s what happens for most people who are paying attention. Dani is interesting and complex in regards to how she becomes numb to the horrors around her, but I still find her transition to be more horrifying because people still see her as a victim at the end. If the movie was flipped and she was a male, I don’t think this would be viewed positively at all. Cinematography was amazing though and the score was just spot on.",c7y18a
f81k2vs,"An incel lens? lol. I’m analyzing it through a human lens. It’s disturbing to me that an honest comment about the role sex plays when it comes to sympathy for one character and not the other can receive such a knee jerk retaliation. 

Obviously my comment is for those who didn’t sympathize with her boyfriend and for a society that thinks she’s still the victim. You have only to scroll through the comments about this film to see that she is clearly viewed as the victim while he’s seen as a jerk. 

Even you are saying she had no choice when Dani makes clear choices through out the film and stands by them as she goes along. She’s the only one not terrorized and constantly welcome in the cult. She’s the May Queen and though there’s a pet of her that’s checked out by the end of the film she clearly picks him to die when she could’ve spared him, she doesn’t concern herself with where anyone went, and suffers no consequences for her actions while all the males and the one female attached to a male in a healthy way, all suffer for their existence. 

It’s a pretty clear line of sight for me, and there’s nothing wrong with it. But I don’t think the film would’ve been seen or viewed the same way had the characters all changed their sex to the opposite, and to me, that’s a flaw. 

Side note: Saying a man could be the victim isn’t being an incel, it’s being human and acknowledging there is prejudice in the way we view victim-hood in western society. Changing race would also have a different affect and feeling, I only brought up his sex because he was clearly raped but no one really seems overly nauseated by that or bothered by his rape/murder because he was mean to her in the film. Her feelings are clearly elevated over his personhood and it’s weird.",c7y18a

As far as they knew it was just some group of hippies where they were going to get high for a week or two.

Personally, I would feel *more* alone if I was screaming out in grief and that's all anybody was doing in return. I might as well be screaming into a mirror. I would want somebody to do *anything* different - be calm, be soothing, be still...don't echo the horrible things I'm feeling back into my face. It was insanity! It was so scary!

I don’t think anybody’s death was “warranted”, which I think is one of the cornerstones of horror films - people unjustly killed, often in grizzly ways. If it’s “the slut” or “the fool”, it’s never *justified*.

Ari seems to be telling stories of individuals whose fates are written - the family in *Hereditary* was helpless to stop the possession taking over, while Dani’s emotional trauma, disturbances, and being drugged for most of the movie, let her guards down and became manipulated into joining an evil cult that poses as an exit out of her horrible life. The Swedish friend was most insistent she come along, so he knew what he was doing all along.

As awful as it was, I was mesmerized by her trying to walk in her may queen dress in front of the burning building, realizing what she’s done, and then accepting her new role and her new “family”.",c7y18a
euftosv,"Yeah I felt that too. Hereditary’s characters couldn’t avoid their fate. Even Charlie’s death was planned, right down to using Annie’s grief and desperation as an opportunity to “bring” Charlie back into the home.

evq08i9,"That can be said for any extreme negative emotion though. I can sympathize with Danni looking to find a new family with her wound being so new.

Her reaction to Christian was plausible given their current relationship. Her acceptance of the murder of the other members of group is not. Especially the britts, who she knew wanted to leave, wanted nothing to do with the commune, and still got murdered.

Additionally, Pelle (I think thats you spell it) lied and tricked the friend group into coming to this festival. Simply sharing in ones grief is not enough of a character motivation for one to completely forgive / accept the terrible things happening in this village.

Danni is a smart, observant woman who was aware wierd  things were happening in the village, and while completely understandable that she would still be hurt having seen christian cheat on her, I simply cant imagine her not realizing that the village also has a part in what was going on. I mean there was damn chanting going on. 

All in all, smart girl is smart to increase tension, smart girl becomes emotional and stupid to wrap up the plot? Lazy writing.

She should have been forced to choose between Pelle and Christian. Both cheated on her, but one of them was kind and forward about it.",c7y18a
ewvfvxp,"I 100% agree with you that she feels (and probably is) accepted by the cult. My issue is not whether or not she feels welcomed or accepted, but that she is willing to commit murder under the pretext of a cult ritual.

One could argue that the cult allowed her to see her own self worth, and then looking back recognized how terribly Chris treated her... However, thats now what was presented, instead we we are presented a very surface level ""revenge""  troupe for Chris cheating on her... Which just doesnt seem in character for her.

Honestly, I wish there was a little more emphasis on her choice. Instead we are left to simply interpret the results rather then her motivation. Perhaps she wasnt motivated by revenge, but felt wrong about killing a cult member that had treated her well, and christian was a sad biproduct of that choice?

Regardless, as it is presented now, it's just too weak and has too many holes to make any real analysis.",c7y18a
f5qwyzq,"I really thought that when she was to decide the final sacrificial lamb, she would pick Pelle. It would've brought some justice to the whole situation, since he's the reason all of this happened. Her boyfriend was drugged out of his mind so punishing him for what he did was so retarded, but then again she was just as drugged so she probably couldn't think straight.

I know she had to choose between the 2 people presented but I'm sure the ""may queen"" can make up a new rule on the spot should she wish to do so.",c7y18a
f5ovytd,"She was a whiner before they even died who was emotionally blackmailing her boyfriend into enabling her. She clearly wasn't wanted on the trip but invited herself anyway. She didn't even mourn in dignity, she had that annoying wail. Then as soon as they're there, she's the only normal-acting person and her extreme neediness/anxiety took a backseat. I didn't see the long opening as particularly productive, maybe one scene of how she used to be would've been good, but they overdid it so I couldn't get my original impression out of mind.",c7y18a
f66iz22,"I don't agree with that at all. It is clear that he has been planning to go to Sweden all along since we heard about it 6 months prior. He is trying to lie to her that he wasn't sure whether he would go, but he had already bought the ticket so obviously he was hiding it from her on purpose. And when she tried to express that, he didn't want to apologize he just said he was going to leave, which made her apologize to him because she didn't want him to leave.
After being overtaken by the cult she no longer needed him, just as they were explaining earlier she has a family to ""empathize"" with her sadnesses now. To me that was a big part of the movie, her allowing herself to have these interactions with her boyfriend at the beginning versus her accepting the breakup at the end.
Also I believe he invited her on the trip because he told his friends she thought it was their idea to invite her.
He's also similarly inattentive to his other friends, he pulls a similar dishonest move with Josh about his thesis but Josh calls him on it, he doesn't listen to Dani when she's telling him about the boyfriend supposedly leaving without his girlfriend, he disavows himself from Josh to the cult when Josh goes missing and doesn't seem to care about Mark's disappearance.",c7y18a
f5txac2,"The way Christian made it sound, he asked her to go with them. Probably because he was going to break up with her before her family died but now he feels guilty. 

Christian seems like the type that doesn't make any decisions on his own. He won't break up with Dani because she is pretty needy. He is going on this trip because his friends all want to go. And he only decides while they are there what he is writing his thesis on, even though he knows his friend is writing it on the same thing. 

Dani seems in a daze most of the movie. Her family dies, her bf is going to leave on a trip for a month and a half, and she already feels like she is clingy with him. The drugs don't help once they get there, and they are always feeding them or making them drink something (probably all drugged). So I think a lot of her emotions are tied to the drugs they are just filling her with.",c7y18a

I'm still not sure exactly how Connie died, so I think it's a possibility?

1) The apartment argument to me showed how he was hamstrung by guilt and didn't have the guts to tell her that he was going to leave her alone for a month. I know if I was in his shoes I would have a really tough time telling my SO I was going away. He obviously shouldn't have lied but nobody's perfect; 

2) His response to her reaction to the ritual suicides makes sense to me. He's an anthropology student (I think) so he's watching it from a more academic perspective. Frankly I get why it would be annoying to have to coddle (for lack of a better word) someone who essentially invited themselves to come along;

3) Yeah, he's a huge dick to Josh lol. Nothing to add there",c7y18a

Wow. I'm honestly surprised to see that from so many people. He was totally correct in doing that. Josh went off and did that on his own. Nobody else had anything to do with it. He was right to distance himself from someone who would do something that inappropriate. Especially since they were both likely to be suspected. If anything it just emphasizes how wrong Josh's actions were since Christian is getting dragged into it by association.",c7y18a

Not gonna say Christian was an amazing boyfriend or anything, but given the context of their relationship: 4 years deep, no-minimal sex, gf is constantly depressed/anxious and has turned to pills, her family then all die... I'd say he was trying to do a decent job. Hell, we was even neglecting important aspects of his own life for their relationship.  


He's there when she needs him (sometimes more empathetic than others). Then invites her on the vacation. Holds off on taking drugs with her until she feels comfortable enough. He probably tells her to take some time to herself because lately she seems to do that when she gets overwhelmed (trips to the bathroom, outhouse, etc). He also initially refused that laced drink. Come on. He has a ""bad trip,"" like he predicted, because he was completely paranoid - he knew he was powerless in the middle of nowhere surrounded by immoral culties that wanted him to impregnate one of their own ""or else."" If you couldn't tell this by his facial expressions and body language leading up to the climax, Idk what else I could say to convince you.  


What he did to Josh was the only antagonistic aspect of this character. The only time I really felt he was being a douche/shitty person. Everything else seemed like blurred lines resulting from his weaknesses. I disagree that Christian was as shitty as his friends. Just as the movie conveys a rift between Christian and Dani, it also conveys a strong rift between Christian and his friends. He sacrificed a lot for Dani, and in the end she sacrificed him!

He was doing the bare minimum if even that. Any sane boyfriend would have taken her away the second the suicides happened, he did nothing to take care of her. He knew the redhead wanted to fuck him, and he willingly took the hallucinogens even when knowing that it lowered his inhibitions. The girl who gave it to him straight up said this drink lowers your inhibitions and makes you open to influence and said oh okay I'll have some of that, while this redhead who wants to fuck me is leering at me. I think he wanted plausible deniability, like he wanted to get away from Dani, but didn't want to make the plunge himself. Not to say that Dani was innocent, she was clearly an emotional leech in many ways, but Christian for sure was not innocent.",c7y18a
f1ekrhf,"Yeah. I’m not taking sides here. The man didn’t cheat, he was raped. But speaking of movie symbolisms, it feels like it was representing how draining some relationships can be whether it’s her leaning too much in him until her sorrow became contagious to him and also how at the start of the film, he seemed rather passive aggressive at the start.

I didn’t think he was a dick for not wanting to go out with someone who had massive trauma on in their lives, some people can’t handle that and that’s ok, it doesn’t make them bad people, What I took issue with was his total reluctance to end it when it’s clear his discomfort has been going on for a long time, and also in context he’s clearly weak willed in other areas of his life and it read to me like he just didn’t want to go through a break up. He absolutely didn’t deserve his fate at all, and I agree that Dani’s smile at the end wasn’t a ‘yas Queen!’ Or whatever but just a sign that she’s totally under the influence of the cult now",c7y18a

Obviously people will notice -- her landlord, her department when she doesn't come back for classes or get in touch -- but it's unlikely they'll report her missing right away, it'll take time for people to put the pieces together (""Wait, NOBODY has heard from her?"") The big question mark is the men and the two from Britain. We never hear anything about what their family situations or contacts are like. It wouldn't surprise me if Pelle and Ingemar were deliberately seeking out people both vulnerable to being pulled into a cult and who wouldn't be missed immediately. I doubt Pelle would ever be in personal jeopardy, it's not like he's going to go back to the anthro department himself.

I understand that but I think the movie could not deliver this premise well and the death of her family was kind of distracting to me. This event must have had such a strong impact on her but I just didn't feel it really mattered to her that much and the story. I am not saying she didn't care about it but it just didn't really matter to all the things that happened in the camp and it was also distracting because it made the complicated relationship with her boyfriend less meaningful and it felt like both themes rather collided with each other rather than being complementary.

&#x200B;

By the way, her name is Dani and not Andi ;).

&#x200B;

Edit:

>I don’t think we were meant to care very much about the friends and their deaths

I think we should feel an emotional reaction when more or less important characters are dying in a movie. I cheered for the characters in horror movies such as ""Cabin in the Woods"", ""Scream"" or also ""Hereditary"". I don't mean to say we must feel sad then but at least feel that their death have an impact on the movie but here I cared as much about their deaths as I care about a random bad guy getting killed by James Bond in a fight.",c7y18a

I just didn't really feel it mattered so much that her parents and her sister died.

However, aside from being a kind of 'break-up' story, I think it was meant as a kind of fairy tale for Dani, since, like you said, she had no family left where she came from and Christian was essentially a form of closure for her. He was not much of a support system to begin with in the movie.

Also, earlier in the movie when Pelle and Dani are sitting at the foot of the bed talking, he asks her if she feels ""held"" by Christian and if he feels like home to her. He says that he was picked up and held by the community and they became his family after his parents were sacrificed when he was a child.",c7y18a

-initially interesting cinematography but get very pretentious later in the film (i liked when they are in the living room and half the characters are in the mirror discussing the trip)

- strange editing (a lot of solo random cuts to the inbred kid: one were he is lying in bed and another were he is finger painting the book. Those two spring to mind immediately.)

- didn't love the acting by the male and female lead (i feel like for most of it the guy's only direction was to bug your eyes open as wide as possible and breath through your mouth)

-poor dialogue, maybe this was intention but idk it doesn't feel like it was
""i think i ate some of her pubic hair"" ""yeah that's probably right"". 
""hey i think the two people from london got murdered"" ""yeah that's cool and all but do ya'll got a problem with inbreeding""

The movie was about so much more than grief though. The others were crying with her as a way of showing sympathy. It was another of their means to sway her into joining their family. 

I've seen a lot of people say the movie is about grief, etc., but mostly I thought it was about manipulation, and especially how the truth can be used to achieve that. Pelle and his group didn't lie (except maybe for Simon and Connie), Mark didn't seem to lie (he seemed like a genuine idiot), Josh never lied. 

Christian was the one who did lie. Perhaps they were just tiny lies. (1. Not telling her about going to Sweden; 2. Telling her he didn't forget her birthday, when he had; 3. Probably lying about not remembering how long they'd been dating). 

He didn't come off as a very sympathetic character. He didn't really seem to actually care about anything. They didn't show Dani considering her pick near the end of the movie for very long – I'm guessing she pretty quickly chose for Christian to burn.

I read somewhere that Hereditary was influenced by a death in Ari Aster's family and Midsommar was influenced by Ari Aster's relationship in the aftermath of that death. I imagined that there was some of Ari in the Dani character. I thought a lot of the film was about navigating the boundary of what is fair to ask of another person, when a relationship becomes ""setting yourself on fire to keep another person warm"" (kind of in a literal sense in the end), what to do when you're the person asking/needing the other person to give so much of themselves to you. Dani needs more emotional support than Christian is capable of giving. Their relationship is full of resentment on both sides and clearly past its expiration date. The cult represents this limitless, fantastical level of unity and support without having to worry about burning the other person out or asking too much of them. You understand why it appeals to Dani given her history, but it's also creepy, because joining it represents a death of identity/individuality as well.",c7y18a

esqaqah,"Good question.

First of all let me say I never saw any Hereditary trailers so I can't compare! I mean honestly I know at the end of the day trailers are not a good thing to go by. Actually that's kind of why these days I don't watch many trailers because what's the point? One they don't have much to do with the movie usually and two I don't want to spoil anything.

The obvious point of Hereditary was the cult was trying to get a body ready to be possessed by Paimon.

That's what I'm talking about. The overlying point of why they're doing everything. Without that, all the subtle meanings of everything don't exist. So if they never were trying to get Paimon back in a body, none of the symbolism and metaphors would have happened.

For instance, the movie was full of resentment, guilt, hopelessness and existentialism. But none of that would have happened to them without the reason the cult was putting them through it.

Likewise, what's the mechanism that brings the outsiders into the community? They needed to sacrifice people for some purpose.

To me, that purpose is like... nothing. In Hereditary it's supernatural and all the pain they go through in the movie weakens them enough to get Paimon where he needs to go. In Midsommar, they want to kill people for a generic bless our crops and community situation. There's nothing supernatural or poignant about it at all.

Not sure how you reached the conclusion that he purely cheated on dani when he was reluctant to take their drugs, was clearly uncomfortable leading up to that moment and definitely knew he had a slim chance of survival. In his mind, whether he fucked the girl or not they were gonna kill him... enough to make anyone nervous af. One could reason that fucking that girl was the only way he was gonna survive (through his child).

We’re definitely meant to see Christian as an idiot/slacker, but given everything going on in his relationship it’s understandable.

Edit: oh yeah, the way he just woke up after nutting (which was hilarious) indicated to me that the spell/trance they attempted to put him in was successful.",c7y18a
etmwlbp,"Firstly, I'm going to point out that it's easy to overlook Dani because she is a very passive character compared to the rest. The film also seems to be trying to take your focus off of Dani while it throws shade onto the majority of the other characters.   


Second, I think you've missed the point of her ""arc"" to some degree. What you see as development/progress, I saw as a downward spiral. She doesn't have some big ""revelation,"" in the heat of the moment, filled with rage and a need for vengeance (still no emotional control), she breaks and sentences Christian to burn. It's not like she has the spine to break up with him nor does she kill him herself - which probably, yet again, helps the audience disassociate her involvement in the events taking place.  


The Harga are not a ""community that fully empathize"" with Dani.... wtf. They literally tried to lure her away so that they could perform a sex ritual with Christian. Lol! Her ""community"" literally CAUSED her pain. That'd be like if I killed your father and then tried to grieve with you, you'd push me as far away as possible. Unfortunately, even though she seems to be the most concerned about all the crazy shit going on in the commune, she fails to connect the dots and place any blame on the community. And Pelle is just a little nymph doing what he had to do for the benefit of the cult - he doesn't genuinely care about Dani. Check the mural again from the beginning of the movie if you can't see him in this light. It just BLOWS MY MIND that anyone could act like Dani has character development. She has a goddamn breakdown... which is to be expected since she doesn't actually address any of her problems and always turns to medication (Ativan, sleeping pills, Harga tea).

Dani’s smile was not a sign of healthy empowerment. Was the smile at the end of heredity a sign of a good thing?? No. The cult was run by a bunch of manipulative old men who stay in power by making up scripture. It is not a story of real female empowerment, but how cult’s manipulate people at their lowest.

But lol bf a dick and she was happy about it. Such a cathartic smile right?? Pretty absurd that is the take away. Pele manipulated what he knew was an unhealthy relationship when Dani was at her lowest. This is intended to be a terrifying ending, not happy at all.

It's one of those movies where you're not there to be necessarily shocked or surprised, although Dani's whole internal journey is very interesting when you piece it together afterwards. The kind of movie Midsommar is trying to be is a more reliant on the atmosphere and visual storytelling. There's a lot of cool imagery stuffed into this film and it all plays out like a bad shroom trip.

Horror is a weird genre where there are a few different groups that look for completely different things going into it, so this movie is going to be pretty polarizing and I don't think the people who like this movie expect everyone too. I sure don't.

Edit: Also about your comment on how the main group acted, I do somewhat agree. But Dani has been gaslighted and traumatized for years so who knows what's going in her mind when she's trying to cope with stuff. Christian is an oblivious moron, established pretty early on.

And bares no realism with the real world. Like that dance scene for instance, sure it looks cool but what was the purpose? So she had a great time but how is that any different from people getting drunk and dancing in the pub? In both case they are drugged and the premise is having a good time. But that doesn't change our perception of sadness entirely and we don't think killing our partner will give us the happiness we were looking. Likewise, this film has many scenes like that.

He's mainly staying with her because of guilt; her anxiety and worries causes her to be apologetic which makes him feel guilty even more (not that I blame Dani for it because I emphasize with both sides). Despite being attracted to Maja, he stayed loyal towards Dani by refusing the sex when it was proposed to him.

I far preferred this one, because of the attention to detail in making the community seem real, which made it more scary without relying on jump scares or gore for fear (although there is plenty of gore in this film).  The relying on the paranormal/occult stuff in Hereditary kinda ruined the last act for me.  Gore feels different when the story isn't compelling.

I don't think Dani was going off-character at all when she decided to let her bf burn. After the deaths in her family she was grasping for support from anywhere she could find it. That's how cults target people, they look for people who are looking for a shoulder to lean on, become that shoulder, and then they don't let go.

By the end of the film, Dani realized that the cult gave her more emotional support than her relationship with her BF. When you pair that with the fact that she had just seen him screwing someone else (in the freakiest way possible), and she was still tripping on mushroom juice, it made sense that she would let him die instead of some randomly-selected guy she had never met. 

The whole time she was there, the cult was trying to separate Dani from her friends and convince her that she would be happier with them (she didn't need much convincing anyway, her BF's friends didn't like her very much).

I thought it was an intriguing take on religious pagan cults and what could be possibly out there now, or at some point in the past.

It was hard to get past the horrible acting and reactions to crazy events. Like when Dani went to a party after she found out her family is dead. When friends go missing, they're like meh. The cult followers acted really well because they had simple dialogue and what not.

Hill House was, to me (and I think a lot of people), the pinnacle of horror last year. And 'Doctor Sleep' isn't a re-imagining of The Shining, it's a straight up sequel!

With Hereditary, as I said, it was a proficiently-made film, and as someone who works in horror, I'm always happy when a work is successful and even more so when it appeals to the masses. That said, I did not think it was deserving of all the praise it got. I feel the same with Midsommar; very well made, certainly showcased Aster's filmmaking prowess, but it once again just didn't land, in this case even more so than Hereditary. As always though, I definitely hope it kills at the box office. 

I really feel like there's an Ari Aster film that will resonate on all levels with me, he just has yet to make it. The best way I've been able to word it today to the few people with whom I've discussed the film after seeing it this afternoon, is that Ari Aster is an extremely talented filmmaker, but his storytelling needs work.

Once when I showed it to my fiancée, and then once more by myself just trying to figure out why it didn’t work for me. Ultimately I just find the cult stuff stupid. How they were able to control everything so perfectly broke my suspension of disbelief. 

It’s really not even the bleakness of Hereditary. My favorite horror movie of the last decade is The Witch. An equally bleak film, but that one worked for me, but the horror of watching the family turn on each other resonated and impacted me more.

So the scene where the old couple jumping off the cliff was handled terribly? The scene where the dude's back is cut open and there are chickens feeding on him handled terribly? The scene where the dude is clubbed with a mallet where someone wears his friends face is handled terribly?

I'm gonna disagree. There are a lot of truly great and gripping horror scenes in this movie. Also, and you can tell by the comic relief character who ends up being a jester, a lot of this movie was played for laughs. It's suppose to be funny at times.

Maybe it’s because I’d already seen that cause of death in The Client, or maybe it’s because they never really tied back to it, other than the fact that it was the cause of Dani’s grief and isolation.  It just felt really disjointed to me, and not surprising.  Oh, she needs a tragic backstory, let’s throw this in there!",c7y18a
esnkv5o,"The characters fell flat for me here, and I’m not sure if it had to do with the actors or there just wasn’t enough of an emphasis from Ari on this when he was directing. But overall, I’d say that the emotions just weren’t there in the end product. 

Here’s what I can remember from the top of my head. 

- when they first got to Sweden and were driving to the festival, they saw a bunch of dead boars along the way and they found a tree with a bunch of boars hanging from its branches. Like someone purposely put them there. They stopped the car and Josh got out to take pictures, showing how Dani was disgusted by the whole thing but Josh was too focused on his thesis to care about the gruesomeness. 

- I’m curious to see what the budget was for this film, because I felt like they could’ve done a lot more with the drug aspect of it. During the mushroom trip, Dani went into the outhouse and shut her eyes real tight. When she opened them again, she had a bunch of eyes looking back at her like a spider, and that’s what caused her to bolt and act like she had bugs all over her. She also spent some more time alone and found a dead rabbit in the forest with its innards all splayed. Christian went looking for her, despite the group being very vocally annoyed with her. He catches up to her and she tells him that everything is meaningless and that we’re all alone, and then he brings her back to the group before she falls asleep. 

- The biggest thing that was missing for me was the anthropology aspect and the rivalry between Josh and Christian. Josh notices Christian being more attentive to the Hargas much before he tells Josh that he wants to do his thesis on them. There was just this constant tension between them that I felt was lacking in the film. They’d be neck and neck with each other taking notes and trying to one up each other. They also were pretty excited when the two elders killed themselves, but I felt no emotion from either of them during that scene. 

- When Simon goes missing, there was a scene where Connie was hysterical and claiming that she saw people dragging Simon’s body into the forest. Dani gets them all to go looking for Simon and you can see just how much Dani feels for Connie and want to help. They all split up, and Christian sees a pool of blood in the forest. When he returns to the group, he acts like he didn’t see anything. I just felt like there wasn’t enough time dedicated to Simon and Connie missing from the group. That was a pivotal moment in building the horror in the script, and I felt like everyone was just totally cool with the situation way too quickly. 

- In general, Dani was portrayed as an extremely empathetic person in the script. There were many incidents where her kindness and compassion shined through, but I feel like in the film, it relied too heavily on her just sobbing on camera. She was kind to Ruben when she first met him while everyone else just kind of ignored him. There was a part when the Hargas were offering things like crops and gifts as a sacrifice, and they asked the audience when else could they give. And a little boy offered to sacrifice himself. Dani objected to this of course, and it turned out it was all a show and the little boy wasn’t going to die. But still, the scene was meaningful. 

- There was way more animal deaths in the script. I understand not wanting to show this people people can be really put off by even fake animal cruelty, but it added to the horror in my opinion. 

There’s a bunch of other stuff that I’m blanking on, but together all the little things added up and differentiated the characters and their motivations. It was an interesting film for sure. Ari Aster is incredibly unique and he has a great voice. The film fell flat for me, but I’m looking forward to anything else that he decides to make.",c7y18a

I viewed it as Pelle taking advantage of the situation and manipulating Dani into believing she has nothing to return home to, because she doesn’t have a home. Like he groomed her into staying.

et3hrxz,"So the scene of Dani grieving after finding Christian engaged in the 'mating ritual', and subsequently doing the scream-cry with a greek chorus of Swedish cultists -- this was one of my favourite scenes in the movie, and where some its major themes really 'clicked' for me.

&#x200B;

Dani's been through a lot of trauma, what with the murder-suicide of her sister and parents. After this, her boyfriend was merely 'going through the motions' of providing empathy to her during her period of grieving -- after all, he had been planning to leave, and this tragedy only extended things. Sure, Christian says the right 'lines', and fills the role of a boyfriend and confidante, but it's easy to see there's no heart in it -- he's going through the motions. This is laid out explicitly: I don't remember the exact lines, but during the showing I attended, the audience audibly laughed during Christian's attempt to comfort her while in the middle of interviewing one of the Holgas. He said the right thing, but he was so clearly detached from the situation.

&#x200B;

After Dani sees Christian engaged in weird ritualized coitus, there's an 'excuse' for the relationship to end. I almost saw this as a kind of ritualized cheating. When a couple isn't happy to together, but has no distinct reason to break up, they often suffer in silence thinking it's easier to simply continue on in low-level misery than to make a change. In these situations, somebody in the couple will feel an almost compulsive need to 'behave badly' in order to create a concrete reason to end things. This ceremony provides her with an 'out'.  


So after Dani sees this, she retreats back to the sleeping lodge, and now has to mourn the 'end' of the relationship. Unlike when her parents died though, this time she has a group of people, a literal 'sisterhood', validating her emotions, physically wailing along with her in ritualized empathy. Unlike the solo wailing after the death of her parents, this time, Dani's wailing is cathartic. Her feelings are immediately validated -- physically and literally mirrored by people who immediately accept and validate her overwhelming grief, never telling her she's too much, or needs a psychiatrist -- and she can mourn in the safety of community. For all its ritual trappings, this is more real and immediate support than she's received from anybody in the entire film so far.  


I find it fascinating, then, that the Midsommar ceremony ends with Christian framed as a 'beast' who needs to be burned and abandoned. When a relationship ends, we have to start forming a new narrative for ourselves, and sometimes the easiest one is that the 'ex' is a beast, a non-human, a 'crazy person'. Just think of how many guys go on about their 'crazy ex' -- each time I hear that, it makes we wonder about the other side of the story. So, in another ritualized extension of the standard breakup process, Christian is literally sewn into an animal and burned alive to cleanse the Holga community.  


Dani is allowed to go through all of the stages of breakup, loss, and grieving, albeit in a highly ritualized fashion. To return to the enders who ritually end their lives when the time has come: would it have been better to let the relationship die a long protracted death in a nursing home? Or to have it ritually plummet from a cliff?",c7y18a

She doesn’t want to be her mother and cause pain to others which she tries by keeping meticulous control over every facet of her life going so far as to defy the laws of death. In the end she realizes that she can’t fix everything and seeks help from those around her but it’s unfortunately too late and I’m sure you’ve seen the rest of the movie and knows how that ends. The point is these characters work organically off of your understanding of just one or two as the members of the family directly are shaped by those around each other: Peter trying to strike out on his own since he doesn’t mesh well with his mother, Bryne’s character’s attempts to mesh with his strong willed wife and whatever the part of Charlie that was Charlie being quiet and meek as the result of an overbearing mother who undoubtedly resented the weakness of her child in some small way.",c7y18a

esu07it,"Maybe not ""loose ends"" as in what in the plot didn't make sense or were contradictory - but rather the characters (to me) felt hallow. All of their motives felt (to me) disconnected. Yes, there's the theme of grief - but I don't know. Maybe I'm dead inside. 

But I also wouldn't say there isn't a ""single loose end."" I just didn't feel invested enough to keep tracking of every single thing. I had no questions for the film. But I'm sure there are some ""loose ends"" if someone really wanted to dig into it.",c7y18a
esuvjqq,Maybe it is!,c7y18a
eso5xe2,Then what was the message or what are the questions it asks?,c7y18a
esoa4cu,"Yes, but don't forget that we see that both of the main characters have the same flaw BEFORE the protagonist's family died. We see that their relationship is unhealthy and unsatisfying, but they're both unwilling to let it go. They cling on anyway, scared of what might happen if they DO break up.

They're both pretty clearly trapped in a co-dependent relationship, as demonstrated by their inability to make actual choices for themselves. Instead, they both get pressured into all their decisions (Christian taking Dani along; Dani drinking the hallucinogenic tea) and are hopelessly passive about it.

Even Dani's character can't bring herself to do anything meaningful about the relationship before the cult hands her the possibility of breaking up with Christian (by killing him) on a silver platter. 

In short, neither of them are fully functional humans capable of navigating the world on their own (at the beginning of the movie), hence why they both seem so incompetent and flawed in their own ways when it comes to the relationship.",c7y18a
eso9od2,i agree christian should cut ties if he feels shes annoying but her actions does seem a bit too much. She even mentions to her friend how she knows she's needy and paranoid early on. I think she's one of those girlfriends who will need to know where you are at all times and christian maybe is tired of it,c7y18a
et6bwym,I think at this point if you're seeing Midsommar you should have seen Hereditary by now. A lot of the discussion ties into that film so I wouldn't read these until you've watched it lol. A lot of people in here love that film and it's the only reason we saw Midsommar. Not trying to be mean but yeah.,c7y18a
et5aye0,But I saw his legs. I was purposefully looking at his legs to get closure on whose foot we saw sticking up out of the ground.,c7y18a
et5a6gc,"Maybe. But it was sticking straight up as if stuck into the ground like a tiki torch. Also, why would they bury him, just to dig him up, clean him off, dress him up in ritualistic garb, and then burn him?",c7y18a
esug8ki,"First...So I felt she was needing him too much. Like I'm not saying Christian was a saint, but I felt she was so dependent on him it was suffocating. It was clear that this was something that happened way before her tragedy, hence I felt she was selfish not in a thesis-stealing and girl-deflowering way, but more on an emotional level. It's very tiring for anyone to have someone so dependent on you. 

It's difficult to dislike her because she has so much going on in her life, but it's clear that she drains him. Christian has his own problems, but I felt the film sided towards Dani more.

The second thing that gave me a clue about Dani, was that she seemed emotionally volatile. Like I felt Christian walked on eggshells with her. You could see how desperately Christian was apologizing for not remembering her birthday. He kept asking her if she was really not mad and asking her again after she said no. You don't constantly ask people that unless you are walking on eggshells. 

They both were passive aggressive if I remember correctly.",c7y18a
esuhcw0,She only thought of herself through all of her problems. Everything was about her and ever time an inconvenience came up she'll call him. Then when she knowing knows he's drugged up still watches him burn to death.,c7y18a
esvo71t,"her worrying for her sister isn't selfish. but if her life is hell, she needs to decide if she can be there for her boyfriend too. a relationship can't be one-sided where she is constantly venting and he is supporting her all the time. It takes energy to be supportive to people and can drain. that is why there is a thing called an emotional vampire. it can be a depressed person, constant victim or addict. it's not nice to say, but you really can't expect to be the best girlfriend if you have all this stuff going on in your life.",c7y18a
esvojwz,"He was a total wimp. I don't understand why he would drink something when the girl told him it would take down his guard and make him more easily influenced.... 

yeah, no doubt he felt trapped. I definitley would not keep him. To be fair, he was under influence when screwing the 16 year old. Like deep psychdelic weird cult drugs lol. I mean you can argue Dani was also under an influence when she decided to have Christian sacrificed lol",c7y18a
esvp5j4,"This I agree. I think it was meant to be thought-provoking, but so far I have seen majority support Dani, talking about how she grew so much as a character into this powerful woman who knew herself. Sadly, the author is dead because even with friends, they tell me they were team Dani the whole entire time. I wasn't on anybody's team but I definitely think Christian deserved a bit more slack and Dani needed to be knocked down from her royal May Queen status.

I didn't know that was his intention (Ari's). Thank you for sharing that!",c7y18a
et8kgxa,"Oh, the thesis guys were dumb shits too. But the British couple were the ones that wanted to leave the most, and look where that got them.

A part of me wonders if the reason why the British girl wasn't given the same opportunity/chances to stay with the cult as Dani was was because she wasn't blonde and blue-eyed. A little bit of subtle racism at work, you know? Her offspring wouldn't have looked the same as the others had she been bred with one of the cult's men.",c7y18a
eszeivu,I really wanted to see Hereditary. It just was boring to me. First movie I really thought about leaving. I may just wait till it comes out on Redbox.,c7y18a

esro9uo,"Yeah, like him being skinned makes any sense with the plot.  Zero sense. Regardless if he looked like a zombie or was skinned, its all the same, there's no explanation for any of it.

Thx for agreeing about the flower dress.  Horrible film making.  Again, makes no sense and there's no explanation.

Maybe you cant read, but the subtitle said something in regards to him paying for his sins, or something like that.  AGAIN, makes no sense with the plot, and there was no explanation for it.  He was a normal dorky party dude being put inside of a bear.  I guess that makes sense to you that an offering is someone being put inside a dead bear and sewn up then lit on fire.

esqh797,"Not related to the point being discussed here, yet you mentioned Pelle sowing distrust.  One thing in the movie that I don't remember being in the script (or it was and simply didn't stand out as much on the page) is Pelle asking Dani if she actually feels ""held"" by Christian.  When he started implying Christian is a good friend but a bad boyfriend, I thought it might be too bad-guy-ish, yet ultimately I think it was well handled.  I was wondering if the finished film would have more hints of Pelle's *active involvement* in what unfolds, and I'm actually glad he remained fairly passive like in the script.  He just goes along with everything his community does, and he makes *zero* effort to warn his *friends* about anything or even to educate them.  Seeing the script played out, I think it's so telling that the outsiders have to ask questions if they want to learn about anything.  I love Dani telling Pelle ""I don't know why you invited us"" because it reflects how the outsiders are clueless, and they're really just props waiting to be used for the good of the community.  Good job to the movie for keeping Pelle an ambiguous bad guy.",c7y18a

There’s an implication that it’s all of these moments, not *just* what she perceives to be infidelity, that leads to her final decision.

esnubsl,"I think Ari not only painfully and accurately shows how deeply people grieve, but that when they feel so alone the grief is unbearable and often fully unreachable. Dani constantly felt alone when it came to her family and also her relationship, and throughout the movie she tried to grieve but did so in secret so she never fully let it out. Only when she was with all of the girls/women did she completely break down because she was comforted by others who grieved in the same way she did.  She was no longer alone in her grief. The same thing goes for Hereditary. Toni Collette’s character was emotionally isolated, not having a true connection to anyone in her family, and she had trouble with grief as well.",c7y18a

But yeah in hereditary it was done.  There was a short glimpse of it in the original pet cemetary when gage dies. 

I just remember being 8 and coming home to a box with a dead turtle in it that i blacked out in rage yelling as hard as i could till i vomited and i was scratching my eyes out and pounding my head on the ground and my parents had to restrain me.

Like, she was freaked out and upset but as they all started crying with her she leaned into it and just accepted the pain and let everything out - with the exception of the first time she cries in the film, all the other times she's trying to hold it in and force herself to hold it together. When she finally gives in and truly grieves (not just for her family but for the relationship that should've died a long time ago), it's a moment of change/catharsis. The women all crying with her was just a catalyst for the realization",c7y18a

eticzui,"I think there’s this general sense throughout the movie, and that crying scene in particular, that Dani cannot trust anyone around her. The cult was constantly deceiving not only her but the entire group that came. Something ari aster said was that midsommar is about Dani leaving one codependent relationship and beginning another. I think that’s why when they are all crying that there’s this brutal sense that, yes, they are empathizing with her and reciprocating her breakdown, but that Dani is not truly safe with them either.",c7y18a

esziy9t,Both.,c7y18a
et9wo0c,"My first thought when the film ended was ‘one must embrace the darkness to see the light.’ There are obvious themes of light vs dark throughout the film. When the camera flipped upside down on their drive, I thought about how concepts of light and dark were going to be challenged and skewed. At home, there didn’t seem to be an acceptance of her pain. Much like in American culture where people are consoled by phrases like “it’ll all be ok” and “they’re in a better place.” It seems like there is an avoidance of pain and discomfort and this is where people get stuck in their grief. In Sweden, her expression of pain was encouraged. Feeling the emotional pain of grief is an important part of the grieving process, and they encouraged her to do so. I believe that her choosing Christian to die was a symbol of her understanding that she would have to be embrace the darkness to once again find the light in her life.",c7y18a
eszinsl,"I think Christian cared for her, but not enough to rouse him from his self-interest or inertia. The thing is that at the start of the film, Mark and his friends are actually absolutely right about Christian and Dani's relationship - it's been going on too long, it's not good for them and needs to end. But Christian won't do it either because he doesn't want to be the bad guy, wants the emotional or sexual backstop, or both. So it becomes a toxic, codependent cycle.

Dani's behavior isn't perfect either. She doesn't take the cues she knows are there, she inserts herself deeper. And Christian is too weak and selfish to step up and speak on it, so he tries to subtly and then not so subtly neg her out of the relationship, which is just wrong and awful. It gets much worse in Harga, where he becomes fixated on finessing his way into Josh's thesis at the expense of her well-being. So yes, I think he both got what he deserved and didn't. But I was with Dani at the end.",c7y18a

I’m not sure I agree that it’s fair to say that “luring people to your remote  commune under false pretenses, drugging them, psychologically and physically torturing them, then murdering them” is just a violation of “personal rules.” 

To me, the cultists generally happy, welcoming vibes while they’re going about all this immensely twisted stuff just added to the sense of creepy insane evil.

I guess I should just say that I don’t really buy that the film is some kind of statement on cultural relativism.

The biggest cuts were: 

A scene where they watch a short film about the love ritual (pubes and period blood) instead of it being a tapestry. 

A scene where they sacrifice 9 animals. They’re tied up and hanging, their throats are slit and they’re left to bleed out. Their blood trickles down to fill a runic symbol cut into rock on the ground. This sounds like the only thing cut that was really gory and hard to watch. I believe in the script this is what prompts the British couple to leave. I think it’s after the jumping scene. 

Another ritual where they decorate a tree and “sacrifice” it by throwing it into a river. Then there’s a clearly scripted bit where they say the river is still hungry and a little boy dressed up with decorations similar to the tree volunteers to be fed to the river.

And Dani had started to build resentment towards him much earlier than the moment she caught him cheating. She was starting to realize how terrible he treated her and that she didn't have to put up with it. So when she finally caught him in the act the drugs probably magnified her emotions. I'm not saying that she was justified to have him murdered, but neither of them were thinking clearly.

She is constantly minimizing her own pain and needs in order to be accommodating—whether that’s accommodating her sister’s neediness as a bipolar person, accommodating her boyfriend’s shithead behavior (such as deciding to go to Sweden and then not telling her and lying to her: “I probably won’t go” “you already bought a ticket”), or accommodating everyone around her by refusing to grieve publicly thereby sparing them discomfort or awkwardness. She also agrees to take the mushrooms even though she doesn’t want to so that everyone else will have a good time. She’s CONSTANTLY sacrificing for everyone around her. That’s why it’s such a satisfying victory for her when, at the climax, she finally publicly shares her grief with the women of the cult and acts on her anger at Christian. 

As for the relationship itself, it seems her primary sin is being “needy” by calling Christian a lot and unloading about her drama with her sister. Christian, on the other hand, is shown lying to her, treating her like a burden, flipping arguments around on her to make HER apologize for bringing up valid issues with his behavior, avoiding her, desiring other women, and eventually cheating on her.",c7y18a

We know that Dani needed Christian at the start of the movie, because her sister had hinted at suicide. She was panicked and even then, she was hardly “never leaving him in peace”. She was even talking to someone else about it (her female friend). I find it quite disturbing that a woman can’t lean on her bf of 4 years in a severe situation like that, without people making out she’s too needy.

Would you NOT call your partner when you’ve suffered the unthinkable? You’re partner is supposed to be an emotionally supportive person in your life. Was Dani a bit needier than most? Sure, she had anxiety and a lot of family problems but that doesn’t make her a bed person. She never did anything to Christian in the beginning out of maliciousness or selfishness. He, on the other hand, was completely inattentive and dishonest with her. In what world of yours is Dani the bad guy but Christian isn’t? Honestly if you don’t think you should be able to lean on your partner for emotional support or call them to ask if you’re hanging out then I feel bad for you because you clearly have had some very unfulfilling relationships.

By the end yes, Dani had become much more of a “monster,” to use your terminology, but don’t forget the circumstances that they were in and how much emotional and mental trauma she had already suffered. Her character didn’t exist in a vacuum.",c7y18a

It was not the movie the critics  nor  the mainstream audience were expecting because of the aggressive false marketing.

If it's about the isolation of grief, then what are we to make of all the cult stuff -- the meat of the film, really? Is Dani swept up in the cult to remedy her isolation? Do the ritual killings provide solace, positing that horrific death can have purpose and beauty?

I mean, that all makes sense to an extent. But then what's with all the highly specific ritual components? Why all the ghastly torture? It's like, okay Ari, you've made your point. Time to say something else now.

And then there's the massive problem of Dani et al being *drugged* and *brainwashed* the entire time. And Dani literally sentencing her boyfriend to a grisly death. The critics gushing over the film mostly describe it as an endorsement of total spiritual escapism to ""deal with"" grief.

I think a lot of horror directors these days are afraid of being subtle and think the viewers are dumb. They need to show a character being chased, hurt, killed, from point A to Z, and panic at the thought of the possibility that some viewers might miss a beat. And 100% agree that the characters being calmly dispatched in the background further strengthens the creepy harmony vibe of the cult and their festival. At the point of the dancing competition the viewer is aware of the disturbed nature of everything, yet it's easy to get drawn into the bright colors and laughing. Fantastic.

It's like a law student witnessing a capital execution, or a psychology student witnessing unethical psychological experiments - you don't just shrug it off, no matter how ""prepared"" you think you are. Maybe that's what the director wanted us to think, but again, it was done poorly in my opinion.  


> As for Dani staying 

It's not even so much about staying per se. It's about the lack of any sensible reaction. They didn't even discuss  how fucked up it was. She was suitably shocked, paralized in that moment, and then all was good. 

Her family had died horrifically, but it wasn't quite ""brutal"" the way a couple throwing themselves off a cliff is brutal - her family literally died in their sleep, and Dani wasn't there, she probably didn't see any of it. Quite a leap (no pun intended) from watching two people splattered on the ground in front of her.   


> I read an analysis here in reddit re: Dani's understanding of death in both the outside world and the Harga. In the Harga, people view death (suicide) as something beautiful and that their grief and feelings are shared within the community. In the outside world, death (suicide) is something sinister and ugly where grief is not shared. Those who grieve often isolate theirselves so as to not burden other people. But in the Harga, everyone is feeling everything. This, I think, lit something up inside Dani. 

Yeah, except if anything, both forms of suicide are terrible, and Harga is as full of shit as the outside world. 

Dani was manipulated throughout; Christian was drugged and raped, and all those girls who rushed to ""comfort her"" after she saw him having sex knew that; all the chantings and rituals were literally an act; they lied to their own people, as exemplified by the last scene: the volunteers had been told they wouldn't feel any pain, but they do, however everybody outside the burning barn is again chanting and screaming and nobody hears their cries of agony.",c7y18a

>Like why did nine people need to be sacrificed?

Personally, i viewed it as picking 4 people to reflect 4 seasons and having 4 outsiders and 4 cultists to keep it balanced. As their figurehead, the Mayqueen (Dani) was allowed to pick the 9th member who would serve as the centerpiece to balance the two sides. I thought it was fitting that Christian was chosen as although, he was an outsider, he was the character that was most ingrained into their culture.

>Were there exactly nine new babies born that I missed?

I just assumed they were born somewhere. The commune had A LOT of little children. Not surprised that 9 kids would be born every year.

>Also why sacrifice young people? Wasn’t the point that old people hit a certain age and that’s when they go?

Maybe there weren't enough old people who hit that age? I'm sure there is some pagan reason like sacrificing something ""young"" and ""pure"" to ensure greater blessing.

>Also why was Christian inside a bear?

To symbolize Dani's rebirth as a member of the commune.

>And why did they need to recruit people from so far away? 

If you were going to sacrifice people, why would you bring attention to yourself by killing someone closer to your village? I feel like picking people far away would help ensure their secrecy. That's probably why they initially freaked out over Josh doing a research project on them and taking photos.

>She goes from someone empathic to literally killing her boyfriend after he is essentially drugged and rapped. I mean at what point does that turn happen? She never snaps out of her drugged state and realize she may not have fully understood the situation? Are we as an audience suppose to be on her side after she chooses to have her boyfriend killed in a horrific manner because he was drugged and had sex with someone? 

I don't think she knows he was drugged. And even if she did, the lady who gives the drink to Christian says that its supposed to reduce inhibitions. It was obvious what Christian wanted and it wasn't Dani. The drink just helped to bring those feelings to surface. 

And Dani still has empathy. But her empathy lies with the commune and their empathy lies with her. She knows they understand her on a level Christian never did. She is choosing to sever ties with her old life by sacrificing Christian to become part of the commune. And the change was very gradual. Notice how they slowly ask her to help out with chores to draw her closer to the people. By the end, she is just told to help the woman cook and she doesn't question it. She's being conditioned since the moment she steps foot into that place.

Right after its established Josh is missing Dani and Christian are separated and dosed with a mystery drug that is hyper psychedelic and sedative. It all happens in quick succession. The only window of time where it was established that anyone is missing is right when Dani and Christian woke up the morning before shit hit the fan, and nothing really suggests to the characters they are in danger until that final day after they are already drugged.

I hadn't thought of that scene, but your interpretation in context makes a lot of sense! 

I think it all ultimately verges on whether we consider the villagers to be in good faith or not. Based on this, they've either ensnared Dani or given her the new home she craved; they either lie to their own people and keep deluding them 'til it's too late just as they do outsiders, or they're all in on it and for instance the scream of the human sacrifice at the end was just an individual realizing he'd made a mistake and wasn't meant to have a deeper meaning.

f5krsgm,"It also got me to thinking why the one baby was crying all the time. And now that I’m sitting thinking about it, was the one ‘disabled’ child, the one they claimed had ‘unclouded’ thought was really a result of of incestual breeding and maybe the result of abuse instead. After all, all he/she did was make smeared up paintings. They all looked the same except in color. How does anyone ‘interpret’ their scripture from that? Maybe theyre just writing what they want to justify what they want? Now I’m thinking too much.",c7y18a
f68adlr,"I think most people are over thinking it or expecting to learn some poignant message through the movie. I don't think the film was trying to be clever or trying to be anything, it was just a visual piece of art. 

It has subtle metaphors, an absolutely gorgeous score. The setting is visually pleasing and contrasts the tension so well. I wonder if people went into this film expecting to be terrified (the posters enough show this is going to be a different ride), but that isn't what 'horror' always means. 

For me, the scene where she is grieving on the couch with Christian embracing her at the start is what 'horror' truly is. Very much like the grieving scene in Hereditary. It's those moments that make these films amazing.

This film was more like an unraveling opera of emotion that you just observe from the outside, not expecting anything, much like a psychedelic experience, and by expecting things the experience is tainted. Very similar to listening to a song, you're just 'in' it.",c7y18a
f5zdwm0,"It was just so drawn out for two and a half hours. And to think there’s a three hour extended version. From what I read they actually cut out substantial plot points for the theatre release.

I feel like she just couldn't let go of her relationship especially when she had just lost her whole family despite knowing that Christian was losing interest in her and being shitty. Both of them were drugged, in the middle of a Swedish cult, and Dani is already going through an extremely emotionally taxing time. It's like the absurd, crazy climax. I'm pretty sure this movie was inspired by Ari Aster's own break up and sometimes that shit just builds up and bursts and people make absurd choices.",c7y18a

esq5ae7,"Lol so anyone who has taken a substance can’t give consent?? So all the people who have had sex while high/drunk/tripping/whatever have you, have all been raped? Get out of here. You’re making excuses for a character who has little redeeming value to find flaws in the lead female protagonist because she let him go and actually stood up for herself. She decided to go with a family where she actually felt “held”. A direct conversation that she had with the Swedish friend. I honestly don’t think we’re even meant to care about him dying in the end, it’s her story not his. 

And no. He’s a shitty boyfriend because he can’t comprehend what mental illness is and how it effects everyone in a family unit and the lasting effects of trauma. He also doesn’t seem to give a shit about the clear disrespect his “friends” have for her or for their relationship. Blaming Dani for “trapping” him is blaming the victim of mental and emotional abuse that she dealt with from her sister. Her dysfunction is NOT something that she should ever feel is a burden on others, especially the ones that truly care about her. But Christian seems to make it his goal that she feels “sorry” for the way she acts (ie the conversation about him going to Sweden where him not mentioning it would be a valid concern in any relationship and yet somehow he manipulated her into apologizing by the end of it) he’s a weak and severely emotionally immature. 

Stop making excuses. Christian’s character was laid out from the very beginning.",c7y18a
esnlykk,[deleted],c7y18a
esnhfbf,"Yup those are my thoughts as well. To me the only way to interpret Dani at the end of the movie is to either accept that she has done a 180 as a character or totally disregard the fact that Christian literally showed no interest in that girl throughout the movie until he is drugged (an interpretation that some people here in the comments are making). 

To me that feels unsatisfactory so either I am missing something or this movie has a pretty unsatisfactory ending because the main character’s story arc does not make sense.",c7y18a
esnjry0,She found her place. The community was entirely people who come from the trauma of seeing their family members die with in ritual or when they reach 72. It was exactly the right place for her because of what happened to her family. Pelle was so happy she was going because he knew this all along. His parents were part of the nine sacrifices and he knew she would find what she needed.,c7y18a

esy5uo0,"I think you are largely right - but I'd say that even in our culture we have a lot of traditions that are meant to help foster collective mourning, and help us share in someone else's grief, whether we are experiencing the grief or not. I am Jewish, and we ""sit shivah"" after someone dies - for a week after someone dies, the person's immediate relatives open their house to mourners. We bring food and provide company and empathy to share in the grief. That is just one example. It's just to say that in many cultures there are rituals to help provide support and company to someone who is grieving, and make them feel they are not experiencing it alone. I actually found those scenes in this movie quite moving - that Dani was finally surrounded by people who could help her release her pain.",c7y18a

et0ooqu,Thanks for sharing the link! I actually agree with Pugh over Aster on this in regards to Dani's characterization. I never saw Dani as a sinister or evil person. She didn't show an ounce of violence throughout the film so the idea that she'd jump to murder just because she witnessed him cheating on her feels off. I don't believe that of any of the other tourists either. They were all flawed and dickish but not violent or murderous.,c7y18a

I thought the movie was interesting and definitely zoned out at that part because it reminded me of something in my own life. I don't typically jump into movie discussions without doing my research first. I was off about the party scene. My intention was not to bash the film as it was unique and not based on any book or preexisting medium that I know of.",c7y18a
f9inkyv,I’m not sure she burned him alive because he cheated or because he was a shitty boyfriend. I think it had more with her starting anew. The only thing tying her to her old world is Christian.

esvbsc0,"Yes I was also confused by this.  There's no way they could do it every 90 years if Pele's parents died in a ritual fire, which I think was strongly implied.  It also seemed like everyone was too well practiced in the rituals to have never seen or experienced them themselves, no?  And obviously if the elders have to sacrifice themselves at 72, then that can't only happen at the 90 year mark, or the former wouldn't be a tradition except for the unhappy few who find themselves turning 72 (or 74 or whatever) the year of a festival, no?",c7y18a

f3ms047,"I read the theory that Pelle ran the long-con and fucked up her sister's head and drove her to suicide and blah blah, and I suppose that would be possible since she has been bipolar her whole life and would be an easy target.But, I don't know if I buy into that. I haven't seen the director's cut so I don't know if it alludes to Pelle even knowing her sister, let alone twisting her brains enough to result in what's basically murder suicide, without any of the other dudes being aware of it. I think it's a bit far fetched, personally.

The guys would have went to Sweden for the Midsommar festivities anyways, and they most likely still would have ended up dead and/or as sperm donors, because all their fates where consequences of actions that were in not directly connected to Dani. Without her they still would have pissed on a tree, disregarded the rules of the cult and entered a sacred building to take pics, and most definitely fucked some chick, probably without even needing to be drugged since they early on implied that Dani and Christian did have very different sex drives.

I mean, yes, Pelle was very excited for Dani to actually join them. I'm guessing he was looking forward to refreshing the gene pool with her now that she was in the picture. I'm still debating if his sister (?) wanted to bang Christian on her own accord, or if he was picked for her, not only to get fresh blood for the gene pool, but also to force a deeper divide between Christian and Dani and ultimately cut the latter's last ties to her previous life. Either way, I'm sure Christian would have cheated on her regardless, only in this case she happened to be in Sweden to find out and seal his fate. Then again, they might have killed him afterwards anyways, who knows.

Dani was just the poster child of a lost and extremely vulnerable person wanting to belong, which made her a prime candidate to join a cult. She lost her family, has a shitty boyfriend that doesn't really care about her, and no safety net or people to lean on to help her through her trauma. She was also on anti-depressants, sleeping pills, and shrooms for basically the entirety of the movie and much more susceptible to Pelle's ""sweet talk"" about family, stability, support, and zero judgment. Plus, the people of the cult were all about a twisted sense of empathy, like when the old mad stiff-boarded it off the cliff and shattered everything but his head and the crowd joined in his groans of agony, or the moaning from the women during the sex scene, and again when the girls imitated Dani's screams and cries of pain and anger after she discovers Christian's infidelity. I think it made Dani feel like she is finally not alone, and that it's ok to openly suffer and grieve when in the past she had to suppress it all for the people around her, and Christian in particular, to not be a bother or appear too needy.Those are all some pretty strong selling-points when you're utterly hopeless with nothing left to lose.

The part where he ""cheats"" on her, from what I could tell was not his fault due to the drugs. The movie never indicates that he wants to cheat or lusts after other women really and he actually seems annoyed by the redhead's advances.

So in the end, I'm not sure if the movie wants me to think he is an absolute cocksucker and that I should revel in his ""comeuppance""...

I thought it was a bait and switch, personally.  The obvious setup is “torch the queen.”  The twist is that she lives and must make a horrible choice - “standing over” the flames and deciding who burns.  There are actually multiple points where I’d say Aster deliberately makes us think the Queen burning is coming - the torch on the carriage, the fire pit in the background as the maids drag her away from the sex house.  But she is spared each time.

After all, it was pretty clear from the ritual description at the end that the Queen had no place among the nine burned... it would seem cheap/ unhallowed to still sacrifice the Queen after that culminating event.

Also when he says to Josh ‘I’m open to collaboration’ and Josh flips out I took that to be a clear sign that Christian would happily just ride on his coattails so he doesn’t need to do the work himself.

It's not that she's happy to kill her useless boyfriend, it's that she's elated to push aside the conventions of modernity (""Christian"" culture which overtook paganism) to live in a society where she lives among people, not just quietly beside them. The group of women crying alongside her and feeling her pain was especially powerful, as anyone with mental illness usually feels the need to isolate themselves as to not burden others with their own pain, or otherwise pay a professional to sort out their burden for them.

To me this entire movie is about grief, expressing grief and dealing with it. I think a HUGE aspect of the movie is how Americans keep their emotions bottled up to the point of explosion, which is exactly the same thing happening withing Christian's relationship with Dani. Dani was not WHINING, she was worried about her mentally ill sister and the not-so-cryptic message she got from her.

If you can't rely on your supposed significant other for these things, what is the point of the relationship? He was too weak to end with her before the tragedy happened, and after wards he couldn't end it because of how people would view him.",c7y18a

According to the two instances mentioned in the Sagas, the victims (in both cases members of royal families) were placed in a prone position, their ribs severed from the spine with a sharp tool, and their lungs pulled through the opening to create a pair of ""wings"".

etmqrtj,"It's made clear at the bar that Christian had decided to go to Sweden well before Dani's family died. Also, her family dies when it's snowing and the trip is in JULY - so he has plenty of time in the months after their deaths to break the news. I'm not suggesting he needed to ask for permission, but it's unacceptable to not give your partner a heads up about a 1.5 month trip out of the country if you're in a loving long-term relationship.

Also, why are you suggesting that Dani basically invited herself to come along?

Dani confronted Christian bc it was obvious that he had been concealing the trip from her and had then lied about it. She confronted him calmly and kindly, and didn't accuse him of anything or call him names; she just asked some valid questions. He chose to not answer any of her questions and instead tried to dismiss her by ""apologizing"". When she called him out on the non-apology, he turned it around on her and she ended up apologizing instead of him. He manipulated that situation like a pro.

I think that in order to avoid explaining why he concealed the trip and then lied about it, he chose to invite Dani. I believe she only accepted bc she didn't want to be alone and had nothing better to do, and possibly also bc Pelle was convincing when he told her he was excited for her to come. I highly doubt that a person who is having continuous panic attacks, including on the plane to Sweden, really wanted to go in the first place and ""invited themselves"".",c7y18a
etm7jtc,"I can't dismiss most of Christian's actions that you do. The film starts with him *maybe* wanting to break up with Dani. He says to his friends, but what if ""I want her back""? It seems to me the only problems he has with Dani are not wanting to hear about her family and irregular sex that Mark alludes to. Dani and Christian don't seem to have many problems outside of that and I think he really likes her. He just doesn't want to be available to the amount of trauma she is dealing with. Dani is so passive with Christian's slackerishness and actually even supports him. After he flips the appartment argument on her, which is still absurd, Dani is super supportive and invested in the stress he's dealing with over his thesis. 

As far as not wanting to be with Dani after the suicide ritual, Christian being an anthropology student isn't a good excuse for me. In my last viewing someone audibly went ""pffft"" after he told her to take time to herself. The wheels were churning when he arrived, but at the ritual Christian decided he wanted to actually be an anthropology student again. Instead of consoling Dani, he runs off to tell Josh he wants to do his thesis here. This conversation reveals more about the disingenuous slacker that Christian is. He isn't that invested in anthropology or anything really.

Christian is an easy way out guy. He doesn't want to actually come up with a subject, deal with Dani's emotions or even have a conversation with himself about if he should be in the relationship. Hell, he can't bring himself to tell her about the trip to Sweden. You say how hard it would be to tell you're significant other, but the trip was in two weeks. Unacceptable.

I think we're supposed to realize that it took the cult's influence and environment for her to be able to break out of her codependent relationship - by killing her old boyfriend and entering a new codependent relationship. Is she REALLY better off, now? Now that she's a part of this cult?

Our instinct is yes - she DOES seem happy now - but what are we supposed to make of her being the kind of person who needed a manipulative cult to get her to kill off her ex boyfriend? The movie hammers on the point that this was necessary for Dani to break out of the relationship, but WHAT exactly was necessary? The cult changing her view of society? Her views on murder? Her views on family?

I don't think Dani is meant to be truly sympathetic in the end. She arguably becomes ""actualized,"" but it's through the crutches provided by the cult, which includes murdering all her other tenuous connections to the outside world. She joins the cult in their murderous view of the world, but she's still being manipulated by them. 

I think the main thing that happens at the end of the movie is that Dani swaps one codependent relationship based on manipulation for another one. This other one is arguably better in some ways, and arguably worse in others.",c7y18a

I don’t think someone is cowardly for not wanting to support someone, especially not after that long, I *do* think it’s cowardly not to cut the cord. That’s what I was trying to say. If you’re exhausted after that long, that’s totally reasonable, even if you’re a person that just doesn’t have a lot of empathy from the get go, that’s fine too. I don’t think Dani is a total victim either in the opening scenes, she’s clearly very needy and that is exhausting to deal with. There’s several things though that makes this hard to respond to- you’re saying ‘this is only one scene, we don’t know the rest, like yeah, we don’t, it’s a film, so that’s what I’m going on. And you’re saying that the response is sexist- I’m responding to the example of Dani and Christian, not emotionally draining relationships as a whole. I’ve been the needy one and I’ve been the stoic one, had partners who have been the opposite, and being on all sides of it is awful and toxic, and both sides carry their own guilts and responsibilities. Dani should have broken up with Christian no doubt, and he should have broken up with her, they just clearly weren’t functioning at all. My comment isn’t on needy women and men that are shut off, it’s toxic relationships in general. 

As to ‘the context is that people are saying Christian deserves it’ I am not saying that. None of them is more or less deserving than the others. I said in another comment that the scene with Christian in the cave is a rape scene straight up. His fate is horrible, and if there’s wish fulfilment in there from Ari Aster then dude needs therapy.

Aster made Hereditary last year which I legitimately love. To spoil it a little, the family suffers a horrific fate that was set in motion a long time ago. Every family member dies one by one each more horribly than the last. He deals with a fate that has been sealed by forces far beyond their control. It really scared the shit outta me, that your fate is not yours to control and that some people (I related it to the Trump administration) are really the ones pulling the strings and do not have your best interests in mind. It was a bleak movie, but it has an overall theme. We are not in control.

What is the theme or message here? I agree, Dani is not blameless. Christian was a piece of shit but he didn't deserve the horrible death bestowed upon him. It is enabling, pandering, and potentially dangerous. I understand if people who were in toxic relationships pulled something out of this movie but Dani is painted as blameless in the relationship and only Christian is to blame.

If I look at it as a fairy tale I enjoy it a lot more. Dani has metaphorically gotten over her grief and severed ties with her toxic boyfriend. Because otherwise how is that a happy ending? What's next? She is absorbed into the cult? Her family is still dead. It didn't solve anything.",c7y18a

Christian wasn’t forced to sleep with her.  The offer was on the table and he took it after tripping balls.

The moment he ran away it was because he realized what he did Post Nut clarity.

Who's left, at the end of the film?  Josh, Mark, Simon and Christian have all died. ditto Pelle's brother Ingemar.  If you mean Pelle himself, I sincerely 100% doubt that he's ever leaving the village again. 

He's not 32 so he'd have to end his pilgrimage early, but considering if he goes back to the U.S. -- as the ONLY returning member of their group, since Dani will stay at the village as May Queen -- he'd have a lot of splaining to do.

The best parts imo were her dream sequence and the parts where we saw her family staying with her but those were far and few between.

I felt like since the loss of her family was not particularly emotionally impactful in the film, her arc of ""getting over it"" was not particularly impactful.  This is what separated the movie from hereditary for me.  

In hereditary I felt the dread and hopelessness of the characters and then you couple that with the haunting imagery and you get real horror.

Also, when Pelle sees that she doesn't want to think about her family he becomes more interested in taking her along with them to Sweden.

when I realized we were already in the third act and the movie had about 30 minutes left and shit STILL hadn't hit the fan in any sort of meaningful or particularly interesting way, I gave up on the film. You can have all the wonderful flowery symbolism you want, I think its great I really do. But you have to carry through on your main theme. You gotta give the movie a reason to exist and as many others are saying.... this movie didnt really have that. 

It was more than pretty, with the shroom visuals and all the color choices. But this guy needs to write his next movie AFTER a breakup, not during it.

In the script, it's somehow even worse. Dani deduces what the commune is going to do but doesn't really care, or, rather, doesn't follow up on it.

 Christian and Josh basically love what this commune is; both out of their academic needs and some morbid curiosity. Dani basically tells Christian about all the bad shit going down and the bad mojo she feels permeating the place and Christian doesn't care; and Dani calls him out on all of his various BS and he just huffs and puffs and walks away to adore the Commune more.

et2oa78,"Oh yes, I absolutely agree that Aster does this really well...blurring the line between fate and free will. Ultimately, I feel his outlook is fairly fatalistic, although I rewatched Hereditary recently and realized that despite all the tragedy and suffering inflicted upon the family--no one ever chooses to bring an epipen for Charlie anywhere. So while her death is an accident (maybe), there were choices made along the way that might've changed the outcome (or not!). 

In Midsommar, however, I do think that they lose their free will once they reach the commune. The only ""choices"" possible from that point on are death or joining the community. Dani's choice is ostensibly between killing Christian or killing a stranger--but even that's an illusion. Once Christian was put in that bear suit, he was already slated to die. The fact that Dani is devastated by seeing him having sex with another woman is all a set up because Pelle understands and exploits her pathological fear of abandonment (and he'd already primed her with the idea that Christian was uncaring). 

But I do think this film plays with the notion of a ""fatal flaw,"" that is, the personal qualities/weaknesses that made these characters susceptible to going to the commune in the first place. Josh is too heady and intellectually consumed to see the danger; Mark is horny and dumb and easily swayed; Christian is a weak-willed, path-of-least resistance kind of guy who wants to get away from his clingy girl; and Dani can't stand to be left behind. But as the innocence of Connie and Simon remind us--in the end, none of these qualities really matter, because there were people pulling strings behind the curtain anyway and so tragedy was inevitable.",c7y18a

f4uscty,"I'll try to dissect each point as best as I can, but as a first time viewer of the film myself, I can't say I am certainly sure of the plotline as well. But here it goes.

* I believe that was intentional that the friends did not like Dani because unlike us, they do not know the full situation. They don't see the texts or hear the calls of her voice. In their point of view, she is just a girlfriend who wouldn't stop calling her boyfriend. They might have an idea of why she is being so needy suddenly but it's not a very common situation that family members go missing and end up suicide-ing via carbon poisoning due to some cult-related affair. But as it turns out, that's what happened and the boys had no way of knowing it would turn out like this. Plus, it's likely that the boys aren't exactly on good terms with Dani beforehand as well, as are in some real world relationships.
* Well Mark is well established as an immature asshole, and immature assholes aren't exactly known to be very logical or reasonable, but I see your point.
* I don't think the group doesn't like her even though her parents died, I think they just didn't know how to react or behave knowing that they are going on a trip which is supposed to be a boy's getaway and fun but bringing someone who's lost her whole family a bit ago will not only be weird but also emotionally pressuring for the whole group to bear.
* I think Christian's gauge of the group's reaction was that they would give off the vibe that it's a boy's getaway. But the Swedish guy, who's behind all this, convinced Dani to go through very subtle gestures. It's even possible that he has something to do with Dani's parents suicide. Which makes sense because she was ""chosen"" as the May Queen. I do believe that her being emotional and spiritually destroyed was an important part of her being transformed and reborn into the cult. Remember in Hereditary, the entire family is secretly controlled and watched by a weird cult their entire life?
* Bringing back to the second point, Mark was indeed an immature asshole. But can the script be more convincing about it? I think they can improve on this part too.
* I agree that Christian not remembering Dani's birthday was just too convenient as well.
* Josh fighting with Christian over the thesis is probably a personality trait that we aren't explicitly told by the screenwriters, but are displayed and we are to just take it face value. I know this isn't a good excuse, but when it comes to a movie, giving each character well display of trait is going to be too time consuming and out of place when at the start of the film a family was murdered. It's like ""Hey, I know the beginning was dark, girl going through depression because her family like died or something, but here's Josh, you're average college senior studying anthropology. His dreams and aspirations are..."" You get what Im saying?
* Mark is just some asshole who not only is immature, but lack empathy and self-control. Wouldn't be surprised if this was based off of a real person.
* Seeing from our point of view, it's very reasonable to see this cult as just some weird gathering of people with strange traditions. If the worst are to happen, they will just get kicked out. No weird ghost shit will haunt them or anything. But as viewers ourselves, we know that this isn't just some cult gathering. It's a fully self-sustained world that has its own laws and can literally murder anyone they want without the Swedish government knowing. Not only that, we know there's a ""horror film barrier"" around the whole village. The main characters can't escape this horror because they don't see what we see.

I think the entire film wasn't so much of a murder mystery, but more of a film displaying the eventual degeneration of Dani's sanity and see how every bit of the actions the cult does is literally directed towards maiming and killing the entire group except for Dani. It was to me atleast, a dead giveaway when Belle was pathologically too nice to Dani when he was telling her about this cult gathering. As viewers, we know what is up, but we still don't know for sure. But it isn't a plot-twist kind of mystery, but more like ""how will it turn out""?  Remember the movie's poster of Dani crying? Well here's the thing, she wasn't crying as the end turned out. But during the movie, we don't know that yet, it's ambiguous.",c7y18a
f5qhmtv,"> Mark starts shit about getting high at the same time with Christian rather than letting him use the shrooms with his girlfriend.

Have you ever done psychedelics?  What Mark was saying about people starting their trips at different times is extremely accurate.  It can easily make for a bad trip for everyone, because each ""side"" (the ones who started earlier, and the ones who started later) gets bummed out that they're not on each other's levels.  I actually thought that was a brilliant little line for capturing that very common concern.  It was brought up again when Mark wanted everyone to lie down with him, to be on his same level, which is a douchey thing to do in the middle of a trip, but also very common to hear from people.

It also foreshadowed the end when Dani takes the psychedelics long before Christian does, symbolizing how they aren't ""having the same trip"" or on the same wavelength so to speak.  Which is made even more apparent when Dani is sitting at the head of the table, somewhat coming down from the peak of her trip, and she sees Christian who is clearly just then hitting *his* peak.

>Christian can't remember his girlfriend of 4 years' birthday without her reminding him.

That was a metaphor for him not realizing that this trip *is* her ""birthday"".  So much of the film is about rebirth.  Again, he doesn't realize what's going through her head as she meets this cult.  They aren't on the same page.",c7y18a

esqbqxd,"Well I’d watch the trailers for Hereditary now and you’ll see what I mean. I certainly didn’t feel duped with this film, Hereditary out and out misled I would say, and was better for it! 

Anyway short thoughts - Velle clearly looked at dani as the new May queen, he drew her a picture of her with her crown on. They didn’t *need* the others to fulfill roles but if they had to- Mark was the fool they needed to skin. Christian was the new seed (if he wanted to integrate after fine but he’ll have been disposable). Velle could assume that Josh would overstep too and disrespect the cult so they would gleefully sacrifice him and the other outsiders were loudly insulting too. The whole meek protest of ‘sorry I thought I warned you what was going to happen!’ Didn’t stand at all- imo they were lambs led to the slaughter. They didn’t need to commit a transgression, they fulfilled a need for the cult ultimately as a blood sacrifice as they obviously can’t keep ripping through their own numbers. On a symbolic level Velle probably suspected he could draw in Dani too- she’s utterly bereft, literally cries at the concept of family, and under the influence of drugs and grief would be more easily malleable. The shit she’s going through makes her perfect to be the new May queen. The delight she shows during the dance and that she can understand them is her settling in/being forced in depending on how you look at it (I personally think she’s lost it by the end but I might change my mind on it on a rewatch). I basically think the two films are really close thematically. I’ve literlaly only just watched it so will probably ruminate on it and change my mind at a later date",c7y18a

eta39m5,"> But I don't think her finding a family was the point of the movie. 

No, you're right, it wasn't--mostly because she didn't ""find a family,"" she went from one co-dependent relationship to another (link to quote from Aster about this: [https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/midsommar-ending-explained](https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/midsommar-ending-explained) ). So it's not really meant to be a happy, ""she finally has a family"" ending. Instead, the reason why they were able to get her to flip to their side (or to at least go through with what she did at the end), besides drugging her, was that they expressed empathy, which she had been sorely lacking in her relationship with Christian and desperately needed. They're a cult, and they did what cults do: they manipulated her and broke her down to nothing so now they're all she has. Her smile at the end, in my mind, can be seen as kind of bittersweet in a way (although mostly bitter): she's finally had that cathartic release she's been needing the whole film, but she's ultimately broken as a person and will likely spend the rest of her days as a creepy, smiling husk of a person making babies for a cult she doesn't even truly belong to.",c7y18a

Knowing whether specific people were gonna die, for me, wasn't where the story was.

I can appreciate that not everybody would be open to or interested in that story, but for me, I thought it was done so well and evolved so patiently with so much attention to the details of how each character treats the others and the commune's rituals - I was enthralled the entire time. The final image of her drugged and laughing at her burning ex in her floral behemoth costume closed out a powerful downward spiral for her character.

 Christian is deliberately painted with too many flaws in order to break Dani's heart. He should have broken up long before the current crisis point. There's no indication he thought his friends were actually murdered. He is less culpable for cheating but he made no effort to avoid it or inform his girlfriend. 

That might have saved him. Or not. NOTHING would have saved him. The smart characters were killed offscreen. We only see this characters demise because it is part of the downward spiral of Dani.

 The actor himself points out that we don't see her choose and surmises the cult made the 'obvious' choice for her. Both actors have stated that she is completely insane at the last shot of the film. It is not intended to be empowering, however some have interpreted it.

The director says he wanted this to reflect one of his own breakups haha. It is unclear if he identifies with Dani or Christian..",c7y18a
etnlx47,"I think both of your perspectives are valid, actually. This story felt like a commentary on the individual vs the community.

On one extreme end, you have the selfish, individualistic, distinctive characters like Christian and Josh who aren't necessarily evil, but definitely live in a self-interested bubble and don't want to confront anything that ruins their perfect little bubble. They don't take responsibility for anything (so how can they be evil?)--or anyone. Their world is an isolating one, and Dani feels lost and alone when she's with them.

On the other hand, you have CULTure: it provides a community, myths to help you make sense of the world, characters who are capable of empathy, understanding, and a peaceful acceptance of the natural order of things. Of course, the only problem is that their community is a closed system, so you've got to figure out how to distribute resources and how much time and ""life"" they're alloted before they have to sacrifice themselves. In the first ritual, the elders pass around a torch and repeat that there shall be ""no light that rises higher"" -- you can never break free, or stand above the community, because you can only go so far before being dragged (or jumping of your own accord) back to the earth. 

By accepting the community, Dani is the ONLY character who survives. Just like the remainder of the fucking human race. Of course, the price of survival for her is literally accepting a community that commits ritualistic murder, torture, gaslighting, and incest... But they're the ones who survived. If you think you can set yourself apart from humanity by rejecting humanity's dark and bloody history, well, you might not make it. The only way to survive is to accept the good and the bad. Although the cult can be horrific, they've also got the humility to recognize that their methods are a work in progress... (As indicated by the blank pages in the book).

If anything, once again, the death of her parents establishes that she has lost her family (just like Pelle), which shows us the Achille's Heal which leads to her being drawn in by the cult. This doesn't mean we're supposed to like or dislike her, it just is what it is.

>Like that dance scene for instance, sure it looks cool but what was the purpose?

The dance scene, if you'll remember, was a competition. The winner of which was crowned the Queen or whatever. This sets up her role for the rest of the film, which included having the privilege of selecting members of the final sacrifice. If you'll remember, she chose her bf. So the dance scene wasn't just there for no reason, it sets up her role in choosing her own partner to be sacrificed after discovering his infidelity. If anything, we can see how cults take advantage of vulnerable people's feelings of desperation, loss, betrayal, loneliness, having the foundation of their lives ripped out from beneath them, etc, to take part in their ruthless and subhuman rituals.

>I mean what is that scene of his bf having sex with that minor supposed to even represent?

If you'll remember, it was explained to the bf, when he asked about incest, that outsiders are often brought in to contribute to the gene pool. The purpose of the sex scene is to show you that she selected him for his genes. The women reciprocating her pleasure moans, and then the other women reciprocating the girlfriend's cries of pain were... I guess you could say creative, poetic, cinematic, etc. It is a film, after all. It's also important to remember that this a cult steeped heavily in occult practices and rituals. Just look at the ceremony with which they treated the deaths of the elders. It only makes sense that they would greet the act of conception similarly with ritual, chanting, and singing. Everything, from eating to cooking to sleeping was done in groups, oftentimes ceremoniously. It would be uncharacteristic for them to treat sex any differently.

>we don't think killing our partner will give us the happiness we were looking.

The film is not trying to convince you to kill your partner to find happiness and acceptance, it's showing that *this is what the cult did.*

As a  pagan I also found it suspicious that they wouldnt observe midsummer annually.

People turn 73 every year. 

     I could see the big fire sacrifices with the lottery and the May Queen's rule being only every 90 yrs though.
 
Another pet peeve is that European based neo- pagans generally have a may pole and  crown a may queen and Green Man at Beltane  (may 1 ish) to mate, which is the high holiday btwen spring equinox and summer solstice/midsummer jun 21 ish, and is more fertility based than midsummer. The latter more focused on the power building of longest day. (There are only 2 equinox and 2 solstice and there is a high holiday equidistant btwn each.)

I'm really kinda hooked on old-Norse culture now. The ""ᛏ"" rune also means ""T"" or the god of war, Tyr (Mars) that her Ex was wearing before he had an orgy. It's all really beautiful.

You're right, and neither did any of the American's that came to Sweden. Probably a lot of the cultists there too - even the guys at the end who sacrificed themselves didn't seem too sure once the fire was getting close. At some point Dani will have to kill herself too and it will be hard to say whether she ""opted in"" or not. Depending on how you look at it, these cultists are being murdered because of the beliefs of the leaders. The parents died because of the beliefs of the sister.

Yes! Good addition and good points — I didn’t even think of those examples. I also noticed that Pelle or Ingmer offered her an alternate to the mushrooms at the beginning via mushroom tea. She was the only one who drank the mushroom tea in a white cup while the others chewed it. Idk if it’s a stretch — but even as she’s being peer pressured, the cult is giving her a sense of choice even though there isn’t really. Kind of like how the cult itself gives the illusion of choice and frees people from the regular society, when in reality they adhere to their own practices and rituals and expect others to do the same within.

Again, that line between absurdity and terror that much of horror is rooted in just isn't straddled well in the film, and while the tonal confusion was occasionally effective it just didn't lend itself well to a two and a half hour long experience, imo.

et7nvwd,"I can personally see it as a black comedy quite easily- Scream has god knows how many deaths on screen and is still laugh out loud funny, and I don’t think the death count in this negates the comedy bits either. I think it’s 100% intended to walk a very awkward and uncomfortable line- the moment in it where they say ‘the kids are watching Austin Powers’ underscored that for me. I was like right ok, it is fine to laugh at elements of this even when they are fucked up, and it made the moments of gore and horror SO much more jarring.

I’ve described it as a rape scene as well, or at the very VERY least coercion. The script is online and the script apparently makes it clear that he is down to sleep with her earlier in the film, but not so clear at that part. I don’t think it’s meant to be *funny* as much as absurd (as I said in the earlier comment) and deliberately very very awkward to watch. Like clearly the whole thing is SO uncomfortable - he would’ve had sex with her consensually but now is drugged to the eyeballs and surrounded by cooing women, and the imagery of it is ludicrous as well. 

I actually do think there was an element of ‘why are you laughing at this?’ To it all though, in the same way that’s dani’s smile at the end isn’t meant to be a ‘yaaaaas revenge’ moment for me. Like, you COULD look at it as, Dani is smiling because her horrible ex boyfriend is burning, but imo that would be missing the wider point. Dani is smiling cos she’s drugged to the eyeballs and literally drinking the Kool Aid from this horrible cult who have manipulated her at her lowest point into staying, the smile is just confirming she’s been hoodwinked into believing they are the good guys. I also don’t think it’s an accident that they let her walk over to see Christian having sex with the girl, I think they wanted that to happen so that she would make the decision she made. And Ari Aster’s surrounding comments and the actors involved comments have been that if you think Christian deserves his fate then shame on you.

esu2she,I think the cult is totally off the map. The police maybe know this group of students went missing somewhere in Sweden but that's about it. The London police aren't going to be cross-referencing their shit with whatever American police force would be involved. And Dani absolutely wasn't leaving. She found her family.,c7y18a
esu4mo5,Remover how it took them 4 hours to get to the dirt road then way longer to hike down to the village.,c7y18a
esu0j0r,"There’s a superstition that scissors under the bed protects against evil and prevents bad dreams. By now it should be expected that Aster will make references to lore in his films without making it too explicit.

I don’t know why the mushrooms need any explanation. Altering your consciousness is a normal part of many real-world traditions and rituals. As said in the film, it serves to lower your defenses, lets you take part more fully in the ritual, and promotes group empathy.

I didn’t see anything at all suggesting that events were all a hallucination.

Pelle seemed to have a lot of affection for Dani and knew that Christian was a bad boyfriend.

If you look at his face when the May queen tradition is first brought up, it seems clear that he intended it to be her from the beginning. He knew she was susceptible to joining because she had lost her family.",c7y18a
esu0a46,"> Why were there scissors under the baby’s pillow?

There's multiple depictions of rituals where placing something under someone sleeping has some sort of effect/is a form of magic. I don't think we're supposed to know specifically but I wouldn't be surprised if the answer is somewhere in the film.

> What was the point of the initial mushroom trip? Is it to set up that all this was just a hallucination? 

I think it's just about getting attached with nature before going into the commune. The movie makes a sharp break between the technological world and the commune/nature world when the camera flips as they end their drive. As someone pointed out, technology in the film is associated with trauma. I don't think it's a hallucination - mushrooms don't really do that and the drug effects are the closest approximation to actually doing psychoactive drugs that I've ever seen. Ari Aster has clearly done some drugs.

> Why was Pele so interested in breaking up Dani and Christian? Did he always have plans for her to end up this way?

He also helped their relationship by telling Christian about the missed birthday. I think he was just attracted to her and thought he had a chance of drawing her into their community. There doesnt seem to be any pre-supposed plan on who lives and dies other than that they need at least 4 outsiders.",c7y18a
esu0vxs,"I don't think there was particularly a lot of character development or anything, that wasn't a strong point of the movie. With the rise of prestige television I find film character development to be all kinda useless if that makes sense. You can just do so much more over the course of a season or seasons. 

In terms of loose ends I'm not sure I agree. There's a lot of thematic stuff going on in the background that I think would answer most questions but idk for sure, only seen it once.",c7y18a
eso70ir,"The film is all about a break up. There is an intense look at the intense lack empathy, trauma and the miscommunication in a relationship between Christian and Dani. Dani also wants a family and people that care about her and by the end she has happily found that. The end of the film is her breaking up with Christian in the most brutal way. There are also shortcomings of the individual characters that contribute to their deaths. The entire cult is filmed without judgement. It isn't really made to scare too much outside of the visual horror. Even if someone had a different interpretation, there was definitely depth.",c7y18a
esofgbx,"I have to disagree. I may be biased as a female, but I really feel like the focus was on Dani's struggle to overcome *her* codependency, and the fact that she had little to no self-worth at the beginning of the film. Her role in that one-sided relationship where she would basically bend over backwards to accommodate a guy who isn't even invested was so, so relatable. I think there are endless instances throughout the film that show just how desperate she was to appease Christian, to the point where he basically walked all over her.

1. Very beginning of the movie, she is doing her absolute best to hold it together while she's crying on the phone talking to Christian. A moment where she really needs to rely on her partner, but out of fear of rocking the boat, she tries to remain calm and collected, or at least tries to sound like she is.
2. Right after, she's talking to her friend on the phone about how she feels like she leans on Christian way too much, and that he doesn't do the same. Her friend points out how that's a normal part of being vulnerable and in a relationship.
3. When they get into a fight about Christian's failure to tell her about the Sweden trip, not only does she insist that he has nothing to apologize for, but she eventually backs down and apologizes HERSELF in a desperate attempt to avoid conflict with Christian. This really got me. The fact that she was apologizing to him, having done absolutely nothing wrong. She was just so scared of losing him.
4. When they arrive in Sweden and want to take mushrooms, she says she wants to settle in beforehand, but once she sees how much of an issue this is creating for Christian, she gives in and takes them anyway.
5. Once they finally do take the mushrooms, Dani is so self-conscious and stuck inside her own head that she can't even enjoy the experience -- She thinks the group of people is laughing at her.

I felt like time and time again you see this girl who has turned herself into a doormat trying to maintain a relationship with a guy who couldn't be more passive. A guy who thinks he's doing *her* a favor by staying with her after the death of her family.",c7y18a
esobgck,"The relationship is definitely unsatisfying for both, but Dani didn’t want to break up with him. Near the beginning she gets the feeling for the first time that he is being distant, and all she really wanted was for him to be more supportive. He consistently turns things around on her instead of empathizing. She can’t even express emotions without eventually feeling pressure to apologize for it. 

You’re right, they’re both deeply flawed and codependent. However I think Christian is pretty clearly the bad guy here (at least up until she has him killed)",c7y18a
esob5js,i think to an extent she is needy at the beginning. ari aster has spoken about it being a film about codependency. but it seems like your criticism is more about her being annoying without acknowledging why her character is written that way.,c7y18a
et6c3zq,"Yeah I think spoilers only should apply while the movie is actually in theaters. Once it leaves the theater, it's fair game to talk about at length.

I actually never saw Hereditary, although Midsommar disappointed me.",c7y18a
et5c48k,"It seemed to me like they were skinned and stuffed with straw. Could it have been that they skinned him down to around the calf, stuffed him with straw and put his shoes on over the straw, then buried the rest of him? I cant remember what exactly he was wearing when they burned his scarecrow form but did it show his feet or did they put shoes on him.",c7y18a
esuke9c,He was done with her for awhile. You can see he doesn't want to be with her but was trying to not hurt her feelings since she lost her family. So this whole trip was just a way not to make her feel left out since he didn't tell her in the first place.,c7y18a
esujgfl,"She called him twice. What do you mean she called him everytime she was inconvenienced? Her family dying wasn’t an “inconvenience” anyway. 

How was she selfish? She was even too understanding over her bf of 4 years booking a trip to Sweden without telling her.",c7y18a
esz9umv,"No problem. No matter how much of an jerk someone is, no one deserves what happened to him. I think a lot of people have weird bloodlust fantasies and a character like Dani let's them live it out in a way. Meanwhile they are ignoring the fact that they sided with someone that essentially committed murder as opposed to someone who's worst crime was just not caring enough.

Also Dani was pretty much insane by the end of the movie.",c7y18a

Dude, the whole movie is ridiculous as fuck and clearly designed that way. I'm sorry you didn't like it but it's an incredibly weak argument to hold against the movie.

etumvr8,"I think you're both correct. There was a line about ""pure bloodlines"" in the film. There is also the connection between both Dani and Pelle coming to the commune after losing their own families. So I agree with both of you: Dani is a great fit for the commune in multiple ways.",c7y18a

esucpku,"Yeah it's either that or they just say the 90 years thing to further entice their victims to get on board with it each year. I'm kind of more inclined to believe the latter since 1. one of the major points of the may queen is to choose the 9th sacrifice, and he showed her a picture of last year's May Queen and 2. Pele says his parents burned alive in a house fire, which I think is obviously a hint from Aster that his parents were willing sacrifices in a previous midsommar festival. His parents obviously can't be 90 years old so this hint makes me conclude it's a lie they tell (or maybe just Pele tells?) To make people believe it's a once in a lifetime thing they can't pass up.",c7y18a

That probably needs to be explored further. At the end, Dani was presented with the option to kill either Christian or some random villager (looked to be in his 40s, hadn’t seen him before), I don’t recall Pelle was an option? I could very well be wrong. Going to the movie again today so will see what I can dig up. One thing that bothered me was when Ingmar and the other villager sacrifice were being readied for the fire they were given some kind of herb to stave off the pain. But when they caught on fire, they obviously felt it leading to the entire village moaning and writhing in pain with them. Was it a deliberate trick? Or did it just not work in time?

eszihv4,"To each their own, but I don't feel like its inclusion really mattered because I don't think anything that it ""spoiled"" was intended to be a twist or a shock. The biggest ""surprise"" of the movie for me was how straight they played it. There wasn't any weird twist, or huge shift that keeps you on your toes. If you had only seen the teaser, the only big twist in the movie actually comes at the *start*, with its framing as a story of a relationship falling apart being quite unusual. The actual cult stuff was played very straight up, and wasn't really intended to shock or surprise at any point. For some people, that works, for others, that will be a bit boring. 

I personally loved it just because we get the other *so* often. It felt like it left more space for the movie to do what it did do really well (the way it looked at a culture from the anthropological perspective of these weird grad students, cataloging them with scientific precision, and the relationship drama), whereas I wouldn't have gained much from being ""surprised"" more by the direction the cult took. But to each their own, I totally understand people who want more of a suspenseful thriller setup where there's a mystery we spend the movie piecing together. But I do absolutely think there's an upside to *not* making the movie a mystery you try and crack: it lets the focus go elsewhere.

Toni's eyes just start bugging out in disbelief as she gets deeper into supernatural shenanigans, and that WTF mentality starts bleeding into her husband and son later on.

et8l60j,"I agree on all points, though Christian was only ever in a favorable light in the very beginning as he spoke authentically to his friends and gave Dani a pseudo pep talk/call out about her sister. 

As soon as Dani tried to have a civil convo with him right as she found out Sweden was a thing... Christian's inability to emotionally discuss any component of the conversation and inability to empathize immediately made him look non genuine, unskilled, and non present. He only continued down a path of douchiness furthermore in the film, at nearly every point. I think that's a bummer because I didn't empathize with him by the end, except for his fear at the last supper. 

To be fair tho, Christian likely was beyond burnt out with Dani, and it's a shame he felt trapped in that relationship. I can definitely empathize with his desire to try and help Dani, even tho in a lot of ways she was beyond hope.",c7y18a

* secretly fed pubes and blood
* pressured into drugs after saying no and given an intentionally bad trip
* abandoned by his girlfriend to go bless the fucking crops when she knew he was uncomfortable
* led to take smoke-viagra without informed consent
* undressed by strangers while tripping
* pressured, in this incredibly vulnerable state, by the whole village, to fuck a young girl he'd shown clear discomfort at the idea of fucking before (when Pele talked about her being allowed to have sex, when the elder asked him to mate with her, when he pointedly stayed in his seat despite her invitation). Can we call this rape yet? Sex under duress at least
* used sexually for what his body can provide. They don't give a shit about him. God, just finish already so Maya can put on lipstick right?
* had other women get in on it without asking, see: the butt-pusher hag
* drugged A THIRD TIME, this time full-body paralysis!

Dani isn't blameless. She knows the truth but keeps trying to insert herself deeper bc she doesn't want to be alone. Neither of them are honest enough to make a clean break, and once they're in the village Christian utterly abandons her at the worst possible moment.",c7y18a
et39bxz,[deleted],c7y18a
esquaca,"I keep feeling like “am I an asshole?” When I read all these, but here’s how I saw the movie. 

Someone (Dani) who already had depression that isn’t being helped by her SO (Christian). 

I have depression, and have also been in long relationships with people who don’t have a grip on their depression and constantly seek support from others. Anyone who fucking knows what it’s like should be able to at least get that part of Christian. It kind of makes u that way. I’ve seen it in others around me back in my worst days, and I’ve dealt with it from others as well. When your intention is to help, and whenever you are around someone it is non stop sadness, eventually your empathy sort of hardens into a “I should feel something but I can’t.” 

Like these guys were together for 3 years or what have u. And then Dani has an insane amount of loss. What is Christian supposed to do?; “well like,uhhhh I was gonna break up with u anyway so by.”? 

To me it was someone who already didn’t know how to handle their issues have something even worse happen, and someone that doesn’t know how to cut ties let it go on for too long. Honestly I feel like to make an assertion is impossible being that she both already has mental illness and has an objectively terrible thing happen. It makes I a good movie, because the grief is spread out everywhere. But I think it makes it hard to breakdown and point to if Christian was an asshole or not. 3 years is a long time to deal with someone with severe depression that you aren’t able to help (again, been on both sides). I just don’t really know what people expect Christian to do after her family dies lol. The trip to Sweden is about the only thing I can say was shitty, but it’s also impossible to break up with someone and “be there” for them in the way Dani needed. It’s complicated and messy with no real winners, which is why I think it’s a good movie, and why I think Ari depicts grief and unhealth so well. But idk how so many reviews and comments I see are so “Christian is an asshole and Dani is a weak soul.” Truthfully I think there’s some reverse sexism involved. Not to mention Christian literally gets Cosby’d and everyone goes “hurr durr he cheated.” Switch the genders and that would be point by point drug and rape. Again, I think Christian is sort of a dick (more so with his disinterest in things Dani does), but idk how the other side of the story seems to be totally missed by everyone. 

Idk man. Tbh if the answer is “yes I’m an asshole” I’m glad I watched the movie. Because me and my gf saw it together, and both related to each character of our matching gender. 

To me it’s like when I read crime and punishment. Where at first I was like “yea this guy makes a lot of sense. I relate,” and by the end was like “holy fuck I need to make some changes if I relate to this.”",c7y18a

euebpv4,"Sure.

When Annie is freaking out as Joan is summoning Paimon, the glass moves across the table. Annie bends over to look under the table and as she is coming back up, you can see the “glare” rise at the same time. It is intentional and it’s not from the candle.

We see this same phenomenon at multiple points throughout the movie. Some are more obvious than others. One of the least noticeable, aside from the seance at “Joan’s” apartment, is when Annie is in her workshop and the paint bottle gets knocked over, just before it happens you can see a light (glare - bright blue) in the window over her left shoulder; then the bottle falls over.

The reason I put “”Joan’s” apartment” is because I believe this is not actually anyone’s apartment, as much as it is a place the cult meets to perform rituals. What led me to this conclusion is the camera pointed at the door, above the adjacent apartment door. Why would somebody have a camera mounted to point at another persons door? It doesn’t seem to be pointing down to observe who is at the door below it. I think it’s more of a security measure, since obviously the whole cutting people’s heads off and shit would not go over so well with the local authorities. Drug dealers employ this technique for security.

Additionally, it just looks like a generic apartment. I mean, I am a pretty organized person and I like things neat and clean but this apartment just looks...different to me. It’s just a theory though.

This is why I believe this is one of the most well-put-together movies I’ve ever seen. As far as details that are so significant but so unnoticeable, there isn’t another movie that comes close to this in my mind.

Of course, maybe that was the point... that the audience knows what is gonna happen but the characters don't, and you're supposed to live with that dread until it happens. But it seemed like it was meant to be a shocking twist, and it just wasn't.

Others in the comments have mentioned that the movie is about Dani finding comfort in community, but I just don't see the evidence to support it. My issues started with Pelle insisting that he knows exactly how Dani feels. Before this point, Pelle seems like the antithesis of Christian, but here the movie seems to demonstrate how having your grief co-opted is no more comforting than having it ignored. This happens again after Dani discovers Christian having sex. She cries and screams and the other girls emulate her but, at least for me, the scene doesn't seem cathartic at all.

My issue is that even with its lack of catharsis
the movie seems to want us to find closure at the end, to feel like Dani is empowered and happy. But I find that the events of the movie suggest the opposite. Dani is continually stripped of her autonomy and individuality. It's hard to reconcile these conflicting themes.",c7y18a

But also sometimes I just refuse bcs I know  it wont be as good as the first time. I recently watched Parasite and I wanted to rewatch, but I decided against it bcs I didn’t want to ruin it for me.

It didn't make sense logistically either how they would've set up the scenario with the little sister's head getting smashed off by the pole, as that was completely a freak accident. That moment was utterly gut-wrenching, but the explanation later retroactively weakened its impact. 

Hereditary is still probably the better movie, but I thought this movie was more coherent in its themes and narrative overall. There's a symmetry to the way the events play or from beginning to end.",c7y18a

He received the blood drink when he was sitting in the grass during the dance-off, not at the table. And everyone knew probably, including Christian. As for my culture, no. But if you actually believe in love potions then this is the way to do it.

This one was about a cult festival, what’d you think was going to happen? I expected much worse... even though I was well aware this was never going to be a “horror” movie. Not sure why everyone keeps saying this. You sound utterly disgusted though, so it seems it did it’s job for you.",c7y18a

He was going to break up and on his way to do it he got word both her parents died. Thats a tough decision.

He was shitty for stealing the thesis,

But as to whether they believe in their own ethos themselves, I really don’t know. The scene with the elder tree makes me think they do obviously take stock in certain customs being absolutely legit, and the lottery at the end suggests they would all be quite happy to sacrifice themselves if called on. However the serum they gave the guy in the hut at the end clearly didn’t work, but, did they know that?

Pelle is all of the sudden really nice to her when before he didn’t care any more than the other bros because suddenly her family is gone and she’s vulnerable.

That's not rape, that's equivalent to going to the house of a girl who wants to fuck you, you want to fuck her, getting drunk as fuck and waking up in her bed the next morning and claiming that you never intended to sleep with her.

If a woman is a lightweight and drinks a couple drinks that are too strong and has drunken sex with a sober person who had the direct intent of getting her drunk to have sex with her and she wouldn't have done it sober, was she raped?

Oh absolutely. I think this specific ceremony happens every 90 years (9 people, 90 years) but I believe the implications as well. In societies where human sacrifice happens it's very often tied to the land and how well the community itself is doing. If they think the gods are angered because there's say, a drought, then further sacrifice may be necessary. Human sacrifice is almost always tied to diety pacts, human life being the highest thing that can be offered in appeasement.

f49e48j,"How can you call him a shitty boyfriend..hear me out.  He was there for her when she needed him and even invited her along with the guys (typically a big no no within a guy friend group).  

Yes he could have cared MORE, but unless you've been in a relationship with a severely depressed person you wouldn't understand how it is very draining to try and keep her and yourself from constantly sinking into an abyss (even Dani admits she is constantly relying on him for everything)...I dated the first girl I loved for 4 years after she tried to commit suicide and I'm telling you trying to support 2 people when you are struggling yourself can drive you into a deep depression and slowly tear you apart from each other ..and even if you think you should break up despite still loving her, you are scared of what she may do if you break things off...especially in Dani's case where she lost her entire family...is he really going to dump her right then? 

Yes you can be mad at him for ""keeping his foot out the door for over a year"" but maybe it's because I've experienced a relationship dynamic similar to this that I'm not angry at Christian.  I actually was more annoyed with Dani because she didnt even consider that ""despite all this shroom juice they've been feeding me that maybe they drugged my boyfriend too...welp doesnt matter, I choose him to burn alive"".  Maybe they'd both die if she didnt pick him...I dont know...but for her to watch him burn alive and smile when he really was there for her out of spite because she thinks he cheated on her intentionally is fucked up in my opinion.  They even looked at those clothe paintings that showed a female give drugs ""love potion"" to a guy....then saw all that crazy extreme cult shit throughout the movie and didnt put 1 and 1 together? Please, Dani is a piece of shit by the end of the movie.  She coulda picked the lottery and had one of the cult members who killed innocent people chosen to die instead.  

Last thing, christian is dumb for not looking further into his friends disappearances.  Guess he never read about or watched any cult movies before.  Maybe he could have overpowered the cult with Dani and friends to escape...but what fun is that.",c7y18a

They cradle the idiot ball so hard it's unrelatable. Nobody in the main cast point out how strange everything is and even the ritual suicide has a major underreaction and quick recovery. ""Fuuuuck that was extreme...also, dibs."" 

Also i need to rant about Mark, Mark in particular pisses on a sacred tree, says ""so what its just a dead tree"" and despite being afraid Ulf will kill him, WILLINGLY follows a cultist who says ""i will show you"" into the woods not a minute later. This is after he is fully aware this is a murder cult that deals with human sacrifice in an isolated part of sweden. 

Mark seems like a dick, because he is, but he never once insists on doing something else ""fun"" or even suggest leaving. He just wanders around and tries to keep to himself until its time for him to punch in his ""gotta be a dick card"" and then dies, he does literally nothing else.

I agree it's not a certain thing, but I think it's safe to say that Dani at the start of the film, despite her panic attacks, is sound of mind. And frankly- throughout the film, up until the point of her witnessing Christian making love in the building, she seems sound of mind. Would a sane Dani SMILE after choosing for her (ex)boyfriend for sacrifice, as he is burning alive in a building? I don't doubt the film is suggesting some of her demons have been erased, but at what cost? In my opinion the cost clearly appears to be her logical and independent mind.

Only Simon, Connie, and the main group minus Mark were present during the suicide scene. Simon and Connie stuck out like sore thumbs in the midst of all the befrocked cultists, and the main group were standing off to he side. So where were Valentin’s guests? My guess is they already got killed and meat-pied. There are plenty of livestock on the compound, but we never see them slaughter any other than the bear.

By the way, Dani is only a victim in regard to the trauma caused by her sister. Nothing more. She continues to choose Christian until she found a group that was willing to do EXACTLY what Christian did until they showed up; carry her. Then she escorted him out. 

He actually is both a bad boyfriend and a victim. Even the language you use when acknowledging he’s a victim is ‘he CAN be....’, when in fact it should say that he ‘is’ a victim. 

I disagree that people see him as a victim. They don’t see him as a victim at all, that’s why Dani is discussed as a victim and people hold her up as being tortured while she literally stood by as her entire party was tortured without looking or caring about anyone.

Again (I mentioned this as a reply to another of your comments but I'll say it again here for continuity), there needs to be more scenes empowering this analysis, Danni writing off weird stuff the cult is doing, becoming more involved in the darker aspects.

Following the drink his feelings intensify and the guy was clearly scared af. If you deduced that he lusted for Mya and that was his only deciding factor, you missed a lot. The guy was surrounded by a fanatical cult, could t really refuse their orders unless he was prepared to fight (which he wasn’t and stands no chance 1vs50 anyhow).

I’m not advocating for Christian, he had his flaws. But you’ve got to be delusional if you think he was any worse than his buddies, and especially Dani. Lol. Dani went maniacal and now she thinks she can trust the very people that set her up in the first place?  Come on.",c7y18a

However, he was being served drinks and food with god knows what’s in them, pubes in the food, period blood and probably so much more in addition to the drugs, the way he looked while he was at the table and the way he moved, felt a lot like he was twitching or being moved like a he was controlled by a puppeteer. 

I think by the time he got to that point, he was already weakened by everything he was given. Also, if someone wanted to cheat, they’d pick a more private place than a mating ceremony where old women moan and cheer while they’re naked and pushing him deeper into her. No person in their right mind would be up for this.

Dani was drugged as well. She was dancing in a weird way and visualizing trees as her parents and sister and seeing her actual parents among the crowd and then when Pelle kissed her, she didn’t seem all that surprised.

I do think it's unfair to discuss/debate with someone with this possible guilt, so I apologize and assure you I'm good. I have certainly tried not to project. But I *have* been in toxic relationships, have had friends in toxic relationships, and have conversations with other people as well. To the extent that one can be conscious of it, my comments were not so much projection as they were an explanation and reading of the relationship based on how they usually go, and how I've seen them unfold. 

I've had the discussion that Christian was having with his friends in the beginning of the film, where I've been both him as well as the friend. And though I've never suffered as tragically as Dani, we all sometimes need attention, and we all sometimes feel guilty for it. 

> *I don’t think someone is cowardly for not wanting to support someone* 

Okay. I was led to believe that when you said ""he is actually cowardly and doesn’t want to support her"". Sorry if that's not what you meant. And, you say it is cowardly to not cut the cord. Yes, I did understand what you meant. But all I'm saying is, numerous people are in toxic relationships today. They should all cut the cord. Just that, I don't think it's fair to say that they are cowards, and it's just an unhelpful thing to say in general. 

Even if we're talking about just Dani and Christian in particular, you say you're just going off of the scene in the movie, which made it seem like Christian didn't want to call it off because ""what if he missed her"" (which, I suppose, is part of why it's cowardly in your view). Well, two things to this. In the same scene Mark also mentions that Dani is emotionally abusing Christian (the abuse may be an exaggeration, but it's clear that they all know that it is taking a toll on Christian emotionally). The second thing being, that yes, if this was the only reason he was sticking with Dani, it's pretty fucked up. Though again, we don't know that this was the only reason (in fact, we know that emotional exhaustion was a big one), and, based on what I've experienced in real life, often, it is a very normal thing to think and worry about. Nobody wants to regret taking an irreversible decision, especially one as significant as leaving your partner of 4 years. Just that, IMO, when he said ""what if I regret it and can't get her back"" does not sound opportunistic or cowardly. It is a very normal worry, that I daresay everyone who has ever broken up must've thought about. That, and, I don't believe this was his only motivator. It's just hard to leave a relationship like that, especially when the partner is suffering. 

Just that. It's cool, I suppose we can agree to disagree. Just explaining my take, hopefully without projection.",c7y18a

estdy6z,"Same here. I really liked how slow the lead-up was to the cliff jumpers -- it gave the audience time to acclimate and get comfortable with these nice, albeit a bit odd people. When it first starts you can see why people with a strong interest in having it be (relatively) normal will keep telling themselves that it is, it's just a normal different culture with some practices we wouldn't like. Josh especially has a huge vested interest in this culture being fundamentally benign -- this is a gold mine for him and could make a huge difference in his professional life if he's able to study it and publish. It's a bit like people who get lost in the wilderness but keep pushing forward and acting like it's just a bit of trouble and surely a town is just over the next ridge, etc. They don't want to admit to themselves that they're in a survival situation and need to act like it. 

In the case of our protagonists, the best survival approach would probably have been, first of all, to all stick together and get on the same page (Simon seems like he would have tried to persuade the others to leave with him and Connie, maybe that was cut for time?) and work out a plan to steal the car keys and drive until they get somewhere else populated. But that would have been about the least realistic ending possible; they would never have been able to agree when Josh, Christian and to some extent Mark had such a strong interest in the situation being normal.",c7y18a
etafbvv,"When I say clean plot, I don't mean an over-explained plot. I mean a plot that isn't self-defeating. For example: We are told Josh is an expert on Scandinavian/North European religions and cultures, yet he doesn't even question for a second that the festival he's been brought to has turned into a violent and genuine ritual. He doesn't even remark on the transition, which is pretty bizarre considering he should be thinking critically about *why* there are no known isolated pagan communities in Sweden. (It's around this time that more sensible characters would start using the word ""cult."")

I also completely disagree with saying you just need character archetypes for an ""experience"" movie. Something like Twin Peaks or Blue Velvet circumvents that idea entirely. It begins with a cast of what seem like archetypes, then subverts those archetypes to show that they are more complicated than you first expected. Innovative filmmaking should emphasize your characters, not drown them out. Midsommar never went far beyond its archetypes. Technical prowess and a good tone might make for a good experience, but it doesn't make for a good story.

I am not saying the act itself was not cheating but I can help but feel that  he didn't go into the community as well as the temple with the intent of attending a cult-like rave/party with a bunch of naked older women chanting and making weird sex sounds while the red head laid on a bed of flowers while he impregnates her. lol",c7y18a

This isn’t downplaying the experiences of women. It need not be an “either/or” scenario. The average person is much more likely to dismiss a male victim than a female victim because they don’t understand how men can be raped by women.

At the very least, I think it's weird that people seem to expect Dani to be thinking with logic in this situation when: a) she's drugged herself (again, whether you think the drugs she was given were purely hallucinogens or not, she's still under the influence and therefore not thinking clearly); b) the situation itself is both completely insane (given that he seems to be partaking in a sex ritual with several older women singing around him) and highly emotional for her (her boyfriend is seemingly cheating on her); and c) she's had a hell of a trip so far with a lot of very crazy and disturbing things happening to and around her, all of which she's been essentially alone for (or has at least felt alone), without even mentioning her family's gruesome deaths some weeks/months before, which she's never properly dealt with.

That's why it's a horror film. 

And like. Let's be honest here. I've seen this complaint several times and I'd be seeing it less if Dani were a man and Christian were a woman.",c7y18a
esnnkxg,Well she was under the influence. She had a drink slightly before Christian and is tripping balls like crazy; she sees the chair caressing her with the leaves. Seeing the person you love cheating on you (from her perspective) + drugs can easily go horrific very quickly which it did. Seeing the person you love and have been loyal to having sex with someone else is extremely traumatic; compound that with her unresolved trauma from her family and it's not difficult to understand why she killed him.,c7y18a

I think you’re not too far gone with Christian’s name and his role. He is ‘sacrificed’ after all, and it is a Pagan commune.

There’s also the name ‘Pelle’, which another astute commenter reported is the Swedish equivalent of ‘Peter’, whose job in the New Testament it was to find new converts for the early Christian church, only here Pelle’s role is finding new converts for the commune.",c7y18a

I also find it funny you say she is the only character that “survived because she accepted the community,” when people also give Christian shit for suggesting they try to be respectful and acclimate.  😆 And, debatably, Christian survives through his child. In fact, he has received a very high honor (most likely) and is just as much a part of the community now as Dani is.

Idk, I saw a lot of hubris and little-to-no humility from the cult members. But yeah, it’s up to us to make our judgments about altruism vs relativism. As I’ve stated, I tend to lean towards disastrous spiral more so than progress - just as you said about their deteriorating genes likely not yielding progress. Our feelings aside, I think Aster is implying the downward spiral.

“Despite the film’s reference to the 1993 Waco siege in Texas, which resulted in the deaths of more than 70 cult members inside the compound, Aster says, “I was kind of avoiding for the most part those infamous malignant cults that have horrible reputations, and I was actually looking at spiritual movements that I found very beautiful.  There are plenty [of] cults,” Aster tells the Daily News of the inspiration for Hårga.
Though Aster cites the Anthroposophical movement and its founder Rudolf Steiner, “especially in the design,"" as an influence for the film, he’s largely tight-lipped about others because, “Some of them are kind of still in practice, and I don’t want to put a stain on them.”
“I wanted the viewers’ relationship to Hårga to be as complicated as it could be, given the fact that they are already ... murderous,"" Aster added.”",c7y18a

There’s no big monologues or group therapy sessions where the characters can just let go and say what’s on their mind. So we understand them through the product of all the little moments.  

I just felt like in the film, we got a taste of what was really going on but then Ari decided that it was good enough and we didn’t need more. In Hereditary, we got to hear Annie speak at the funeral, her monologues during her group grieving sessions, the dinner table scene, and the paint thinner scene. We had a very clear understanding of the emotions going on in that family. 

As for the movie being long, the script was under 120 pages. 1 page generally equals 1 minute of screen time. So I feel like the emotional aspects were cut in favor of having the drawn out sex scene, ending, and the maypole dancing.",c7y18a

esu4fnn,"There were a lot of strong points in the film, but (to me) character development/motive is quite important.  I'm not denying the thematic stuff, but if that's all this film was trying to demonstrate on film, I could have probably watched something 2 hours shorter and probably find it on YouTube, Vimeo, etc.

To each their own.",c7y18a
esoh0a3,"Good take imo! I totally agree that the movie is about Dani's struggle to overcome her codependency. But it's ALSO about Christian's struggle to escape his codependency. The movie is just a lot more subtle about it, mostly because the movie is from Dani's point of view.

&#x200B;

The cult is clearly an idealized fantasy for how it can break both of them out of their codependent relationship by giving them what they need. Dani, who doesn't get enough support from Christian, is surrounded by other, sympathetic women, who scream and cry and grieve and hold her in support. This contrasts with Christian's awkward attempts to ""support"" her in the beginning, which are clearly ineffective

&#x200B;

Similarly, Christian's friends are trying to help him see that the relationship isn't working for him. But he's too passive - won't break up, won't actually ASK his friends if it's ok Dani comes, can't even find his own damned thesis! But the cult knows what he needs - a strong community forcing those decisions on him. It makes the decisions about who to date/mate with for him, and the community is all there supporting him (literally, with the butt-pushing scene). It controls his thesis access. This contrasts with Christian's friends' attempts in the beginning to help him make better life decisions, which also seem ineffective.

&#x200B;

Basically, neither of them can make decisions on their own, so the cult puts them in positions where they'll make the correct decision for themselves. For Christian, it's leaving Dani to go impregnate other women - the cult makes Mark's throwaway joke at the beginning literal. For Dani, it's leaving Christian. This is pretty clearly NOT very empowering; it's simply swapping one co-dependent relationship for another. The movie makes a big point of hammering home that this is a CULT, and they're exploiting/controlling their members (and would-be members) the way that cults usually do - drugs, a sense of family, targeting orphans and the vulnerable, etc.

&#x200B;

I agree that, for the reasons you mentioned, you're supposed to sympathize with Dani more at the beginning. But look at the scenes you mentioned another way - if Dani wasn't so good at trying to calm down fights even when that fight CLEARLY needs to happen, she probably wouldn't be trapped in this unsatisfying relationship. In other words - if she wasn't so conflict-avoidant, she would be able to try and build a life for herself that's satisfying, rather than one that's free of conflict. Same with Christian. But they can't, so they insist on clinging to each other even as it is CLEARLY making them both miserable.

&#x200B;

Dani finds a home at the end, sure, but it's a cult, and a murderous one at that, and one that works, like all cults, by breaking down the boundaries between the self and the community. It's clearly still unhealthy, although arguably very slightly healthier for her than dating Christian?",c7y18a
esohotj,"Excellent analysis. I agree completely, and I ended up loathing Christian and feeling terrible for Dani. Their relationship dynamic was perhaps the most interesting part of the movie for me. I’m excited Aster’s next film will be a pure family drama. I bet it’ll be riveting.",c7y18a
esocbyg,"I agree with you that Christian is portrayed as the bad guy, but mostly because the movie is from Dani’s point of view. If you step back a bit, his main crime was being a fuckboy without much of a life plan who refuses to end a relationship that’s bad for him (a bit like Dani). It’s more than enough to make us sympathize with Dani initially, but at the end...I’m not so sure.

I think it makes sense to read the cult as an idealized fantasy around social rituals that would WORK for our hopelessly codependent main characters. Note how the females support Dani in her moments of grief - screaming with her and holding her, contrasted to Christians awkward attempts to comfort her at the beginning of the movie. And how the cult makes Christians decisions for him - who he will have sex with, when, they control his thesis outcome, etc. 

This is what we see both characters need. Dani needs more social support in her grieving; Christian needs someone to be decisive about his life for him. The cult, miraculously, provides those. 

Dani’s needs are more clearly articulated than christian’s which definitely makes her more sympathetic, but I think we’re ultimately supposed to feel for both of these characters.",c7y18a

etujbm7,"(11 days late, sorry!) That shot really cemented my takeaway from the film. There are groups of people out there that prey on people who are in emotional duress. Religions. Cults. Pyramid schemes. These are all organizations in which its members feel connected and cared for...but people on the outside can see the manipulation occurring. Pelle entered the commune when he was grieving the loss of his parents, and he was excited to bring Dani in because he knew she was going through a similar situation. I think Pelle is actually trying to help Dani and does not totally realize that he is manipulating her into joining a cult, but the effect is the same. 

We look at Dani's choice and say ""Dani, don't do it! This cult is dangerous, manipulative, and robs you of a normal life."" But Dani isn't thinking about a normal life, all she can think about is the total loss of her family. Most of us simply cannot fully understand the fact that Dani only cares about finding a new family and is totally willing to give up a normal, complete life in order to find it. 

It's a great parallel for religion. Suicide bombers, street-corner preachers, middle-class families that are swindled into giving their retirement savings to the church, etc. all are convinced that a normal life is not as good as what they will gain from their religion. They are all now socially accepted and will do what it takes to maintain that acceptance, to the point where they will consider killing other people to maintain their life. Dani's friends could have ruined everything for the commune so they were killed. To the commune, these killings are acceptable because they allow the commune to continue living life in the way that they see fit.

I think there's also the shocking juxtaposition of the commune vs traditional western life. In the commune, it is encouraged to throw yourself off a cliff when you reach 72 years old. We see that as horrible whereas the commune considers it a normal part of life. Some people may see this as ""different strokes for different folks,"" but I think the message is quite the opposite. Throwing yourself off a cliff is obviously *not* a great practice, nor is murdering outsiders who won't conform or giving your crush a pube pie. But what do we do in our society that would be an outsider's version of throwing ourselves off a cliff? Obesity? Smoking? Factory farming? I think the film is a call for introspection in our own culture and a chance for us to stop normalizing destructive behavior.

I couldn’t help but feel like that kind of connection in a moment of raw vulnerability would be comforting on a level that people rarely, if ever, get to feel.

I don’t think they were mocking her but instead matching her so she didn’t feel alone.

She clearly had no choice

>used sexually for what his body can provide. They don't give a shit about him. God, just finish already so Maya can put on lipstick right?

Yeah, and I'm sure he was deeply emotionally attached to the girl he fucked and valued her for her mind and character and certainly not just her body.

She viewed him exactly the same way he viewed her. He didn't give a shit about her either, he just wanted to fuck her. For some reason it's really triggering to men when women are shown to view them the same way they view women.

>pressured, in this incredibly vulnerable state, by the whole village, to fuck a young girl he'd shown clear discomfort at the idea of fucking before (when Pele talked about her being allowed to have sex, when the elder asked him to mate with her, when he pointedly stayed in his seat despite her invitation). 

This is kind of dense. We don't see his response to the elder, it purposely cut away. He stayed in his seat because Dani was watching. When she leaves he immediately gets up to go fuck the girl. He freely walks up to her and puts his penis in her.

et5z38j,"
>as she’s the main character we’re supposed to root for her

Not always. Not in this case. She's a flawed, deeply traumatized person who loses it with the aid of some heavy drugs and being destroyed emotionally. Why does she need to be a good, reasonable person just because she's the lead character? Plenty of movies deal with lead characters being or going crazy.

There were no good people in this movie (besides Connie and her boyfriend as far as we see from their limited side character development). 

Everyone was a cunt in their own special way. Josh by disrespecting their religion and taking pictures after being graciously allowed to do his thesis there (as far as he knows) and being told explicitly not to do so. Mark by literally pissing on their ancestors and laughing about it (making every American cringe in their seats). Christian for being kind of a shitty boyfriend in terms of not caring about her enough (although a worse boyfriend would have said see ya a long time ago with the baggage she has), kinda mooching off of Josh's thesis, and cheating (while under the influence). Dani for flirting with another dude (is it implied they fucked after the hand holding thing? Idk) and killing her own (ex) boyfriend in a nightmarishly horrifying way because he cheated on her while high out of his fucking mind. To be fair, she was also high out of her fucking mind. Obviously everyone in the commune is a murderous, brainwashed psycho. Their friend that went out, lived in the normal world, experienced its many customs, apparently made it pretty far in academics, and made close friends only to bring those friends back home to be ritualistically murdered is just another level of disgusting.

There were no even close to entirely good guys. And that's okay, there doesn't need to be a good guy. There isn't always a good guy in the real world.",c7y18a

Maybe ""excuse""-making is too loaded a term, but you are definitely trying to contextualize abjectly depraved and horrifying practices as something that could be understood as acceptable. (Again, very much like the anthropology student.) This to me was one of the clearer messages of the film -- how far down the rabbit hole are you willing to go before you take a sober look at reality for what it actually is, be that an irreparable relationship, smoldering grief, or ritualistic abuse.

Also ""Dani"" is the female version of ""Daniel"", which means: ""God will judge"". Dani also literally is the judge in the end of who lives/dies.

Regarding the bear...I don't know of any more profound meaning other than borrowing from reality; citing Wikipedia here: ""There are also a number of deities from Celtic Gaul and Britain associated with the bear, and the Dacians, Thracians, and Getians were noted to worship bears and annually celebrate the bear dance festival""

Or,

""Usually, Kumamatsuri (a ritual that basically consist in sacrificing a bear after nursing it and treating it as one of their own) occurs in **midwinter** ...""

Also bringing in people from outside is necessary to keep their numbers up and so they don’t end up with inbreeding as they said.

In any case, my impression is that after a certain point Aster doens't intend for us to question this world too closely - the allegory is supposed to take over. For instance, apparently in the script blood-eagled Simon is supposed to be alive when Christian finds him in the barn, but that makes no sense, he just couldn't have survived like that for so long. So realism there doesn't matter. Or the question: how is Pelle going to get away with luring away three young Americans, all graduate students, presumably with families who knew where they were headed and are going to look for them?

As much of a total prick Christian was to her and her despair over seeing him have sex with another woman, she's too conscientious and level-headed of a person throughout the whole movie to want him dead or not realize this was the cult's machinations. In the new director's cut, there's even a scene of her discussing how messed up the cult and their rituals are! She abandons her common sense later in the movie because of the group's antics when they mirror her crying? If anything, that should've freaked her out more! Feeling acceptance and belonging among others doesn't come from them mirroring your exact behavior.

I totally get what the director is going for with the ending and her character. Dani has found a 'family'. After conveying her isolation and loneliness for the majority of the movie, she now finds acceptance and unity within the commune. Burning Christian is the last step for her catharsis and to close the door on a dark chapter of her life. But onscreen it doesn't work. I think the movie really dropped the ball on the aspect of Dani's conversion and her relationship with Christian.

ets4ozv,"He’s an absolutely horrible boyfriend, who’s almost pathologically incapable of providing his partner with the kind of basic empathy a healthy relationship requires. There’s a reason why the Hårga screaming with Dani in the lodge at the end is so powerful for her. It’s a moment of startling and powerful empathy, which is on direct contrast with the complete absence of Christian’s ability to share her pain in their relationship. That’s the moment where Dani “feels held” in a way she never could with Christian. (Yes, I know the Hårga are a crazy murder cult but by the third act of the film their relationship to Dani is more about its symbolic power than it is about its literal narrative implications). 

> You don't see how tired and drain he was from dating Dani?

Which is why it’s a dick move to drag the relationship out for another year even though you’ve basically checked out of it already. 

> You don't see how lost and confused he was not knowing where to go and do with his life?

I see how aimless and lazy he is, and how quickly he makes decisions in the interest of making things as easy as possible for himself even if it comes at the expense of others. 

In purely literal terms, did Christian deserve to burn alive at the end? Of course not. In more emotional terms, when considering the film as a larger-than-life fairy tale about how we process grief, share it with others, and extricate ourselves from damaging relationships, that moment is incredibly cathartic, and it represents acceptance and freedom from a total shitshow of a romantic partner. There’s a reason that whole sequence isn’t scored as a horror set piece, but rather as a profound emotional breakthrough. It’s two things at once. From a pure narrative perspective Christian wasn’t a complete monster and the ending is terrifying, but from an emotional and symbolic perspective? He sucked and she needed to dump his ass with finality. The movie manages to provide horror through text and cathartic uplift through subtext simultaneously.",c7y18a

I don't think you can tell me I'm missing points when you were try to tell me the ""take time for yourself"" after the suicides is Christian caring. 100% incorrect reading of the scene. That's a delusional take. 

The deduction that Christian was lusting after Mya comes from the direction of the camera. Christian takes the drink, but doesn't drink it right away. He looks over and Mya comes into focus and he stares for a moment and then decides to drink in that moment. If he didn't drink it there they probably would've drugged him at dinner, but it was a choice by the director to have Christian drink it the way he did. Pay attention to the camera, as that's also a device for storytelling. 

Dani isn't a perfect person, but in the context of the film she is better than Christian and all his friends. Until the moment she's in the cult, there aren't too many personality flaws with Dani. She is just really longing for family. She doesn't show to be manipulative, she cares about other people and she spends most of the film neglected and tortured. It seems like you're kind of desperate to put this guy in a positive light. It's especially obvious with your claims about Christian caring for Dani by blowing her off after the suicide ritual. I'm not the emotional one here. Christian didn't deserve his fate, but Christian was a dick.",c7y18a

It's one of those ""you didn't do X, so obviously you don't care about me"" situations. It's never about the stated issue. There are much deeper problems that need to be talked out, but they erupt in an inappropriate fashion instead due to frustration.

I feel like their internal monologues in that moment are a repeat of their usual ""he doesn't care about me""/""she's so needy"" routine. But Dani is the one there who blows up and makes a big deal about it in front of everyone. That's not the right way to handle things.",c7y18a

There was nothing to suggest that before he took the drink he was under control.

He knew exactly what he was doing and what it would lead up to, there was nothing to suggest he was under the influence in that moment before that. He was given the pube pie and the period drink but there's nothing to suggest that his food was drugged or that the love spell actually had any real world supernatural effect. Dani also was drugged, but she took the same shroom tea as before, we saw the moment both she and Christian were drugged. The difference is while Dani wasn't told what was in the tea during the competition (though she may or may not have known as it was drugged), Christian was explicitly told exactly what was in his drink and given how he looked at Maja and the rest of his passive aggressive actions and lack of accountability throughout the movie as a running theme, he knew what it would lead to. I don't think anyone sane would have had sex in a weird mating ceremony either, but he was horny and willingly open to influence so he did it all the same. His post-nut regret showed that he was at least in his right mind enough to know that it was outright strange, but the chance to finally have sex (remember he and Dani hadn't had sex in a long time), was enough to let him ignore the weirdness combined with the drug.

The argument scene is provocative cos you can see Christian starting a fight but you can see Dani starting one then backing off, and you want her to just back up the argument or leave altogether.

I always saw it as pretty over the top film that leans on symbolism and imagery we're accustomed to as opposed to depth in characters. Outside McLaughlin's character a lot of it is taken at face value. It's all setting and imagery for me.

As far as Josh and Midsommar, I buy his character and the film for that matter. He was pretty excited about everything and actively learning even when he wasn't on screen. I also assume it would've been somewhat offensive to mention the word cult. It seems he was too curious and frequently having his mind blown to realize anything past wanting to put it in a paper. That's the type of friend he was. 

I took the film as far colder and distant than some. It was vouyeristic how we just watched the cult go about it and had the characters just in that setting.

He's also clearly a shit communicator for not being upfront with Dani about going to Sweden.

et35gnc,"What's interesting to me is that there were several choices made between the original screenplay and the final film to take away Christian's agency and make it look like he made less of a choice. In the screenplay, it is deliberately implied that this is something that Christian very much wanted and was mainly conflicted about Dani finding out. In fact, that is how he is convinced to go through with it. In the original screenplay, he tucks the eaten pube into his pocket and obsessively keeps stealing glances at Maja much more often. Also, the scene where the older woman Siv talks about how he's been approved for mating with Maja is much longer and his main objection is that he has a girlfriend. Then Siv says that Dani will not find out, they aren't proposing Christian marry Maja as he wouldn't be approved to do so, and that it is just a one night thing. Christian then shows more interest and says ""well Maja is very beautiful."" Overall, in the original treatment, his discomfort with the whole ordeal seems more to do with the fact that his guilt is eating him alive and the ritual got weird. 

Very interesting choice by the director to make the idea of consent more ambiguous. Male rape is definitely an issue that does not give enough attention and the movie sets up a scenario where the audience would sympathize with a woman in the same predicament. After all, we have the dialogue now that a woman who is intoxicated cannot give consent even if she did not explicitly say no and that is exactly what is happening to Christian. As a result, the movie forces us to examine our pre-conceived notions about male sexual assault if we really think about it and hopefully will bring up some useful discussions for people.",c7y18a

I do think Pelle was *probably* totally ingrained in the cult way of thinking and didn’t perceive what he was doing with Dani to be anything more than expanding their bloodline with someone ‘good’.

Ya, their dynamic is a bit strange but I feel like a large group of people can relate to it. At times I can see where Christian is coming from.

f36c2bp,"I mean, he was a part of the cult, which is why he brought his ""friends"" there for the sacrifice. Hint: **he was never really their friend.** His true allegiance is to the cult. He pretended to be their friend so that he could draw them to the slaughter and gain stature within the community. Remember at the end when they thanked him for bringing in the ""outsiders""? It's obvious he didn't care about them, because he was caught lying to the black dude and the boyfriend (and didn't seem to care because he knew they'd be dead soon anyway), playing them off of each other, about their research permissions. Characters don't have to be (and arguably shouldn't be) one-dimensional.

\> What was his purpose?

His purpose, other than the above stated, was to serve the plot and bring our characters into the setting of the camp for the second and third acts. He starts off the movie as one thing, their friend, and ends it as the polar opposite, the one who betrayed them from the outset. Things like this are generally accepted as good writing.

Now it makes a little more sense that he was so happy the chick was joining them in the beginning, right? Now his backstory about losing his parents makes a little more sense... because the film is about, in part, how people who lose their familial connections are susceptible to the allure of cults.

Dani always gives in and apologizes, even when she's not 100% at fault, which teaches Christian he can just keep putting things on her and getting away with bad behavior; and Christian won't just leave Dani like he really should, and always caves when she begs him to stay because it's easier for him than breaking up with her, which teaches her she can just keep begging him and he'll just keep caving.

esyvyr2,"> There’s something there... she even becomes a walking flower bush by the end of the movie.

I think this has to do with her becoming the embodiment of life. Her sister says something about the black being overwhelming. To contrast this, Dani is depicted as being overwhelmingly alive. I also think it may be another depiction of psychoactive drug effects, which runs through the whole movie.

>If she didn’t become Maid Queen would she be up for sacrifice? 

I think for sure. The only important bit was getting to 4 people. Any of the other guests may have been invited to stay. It's just they fucked up by trying to leave/pissing on a tree/taking pics of the book, etc. Theres no reason Connie or a local couldn't have become the may queen.

The first member (who is the guy who got mad at Mark for peeing on the tree) is given the stuff and the elder says, “this will take away the pain.” When he gives the stuff to Ingmar he says “This will take away the fear.” The first member, who screams as he burns, maybe is screaming from fear and not pain? When announcing the final ritual the lady says that both Ingmar and the other guy volunteered for sacrifice. Maybe so, but their end was pretty painful. I think the guy who killed Mark was chosen as a sacrifice as he went ballistic about the peeing and stepped outside of what was good for the group. Independent thought and uncontrollable emotions don’t seem to be of high priority with the community. 

Also, their sister who met everyone as they were coming through the sun entrance was being comforted as Ingmar was saying his final goodbyes before the roasting. She was pretty upset at the choices...makes me wonder if she was a “wife” to either of them.",c7y18a

ew2hjn7,Most people who die from exhaust are killed by the CO or carbon monoxide in the exhaust. Carbon monoxide displaces oxygen and CO2 in your lungs and is a much more deadly gas than CO2. People with CO poisoning will often have to be put into hyperbaric chambers in order to recover where if you were exposed to too much CO2 the recovery method would be giving the patient oxygen or just evacuating to fresh air outside,c7y18a
etqksht,"That's not true though, someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but it's not the lack of oxygen that triggers the asphyxiation response but it's the rise of CO2 in your bloodstream. Which is why asphyxiation by helium or another gas wouldn't cause the response because your body has no O2 to process and turn into CO2 thus your CO2 blood levels wouldn't rise. But if you breathed in a lethal dose of CO2 I imagine that would indeed trigger the response from your body? Maybe your lungs don't diffuse CO2 into your blood, so your blood is lacking O2 and CO2 even if you're breathing CO2.

If you read the news and it said “US woman arrested as part of Swedish murder cult” a normal response would be WTF??? And not “fair enough - her bf deserved to die”. What the director does expertly is MAKE you feel on her side and he wants you to sympathise (IMO). It’s up to you, the viewer, to reject what you’re presented.

est379e,[deleted],c7y18a
et0uu7m,"I’d question if he really “gaslighted” her. 

Not to be mr r/asablackguy here, but I’ve been gaslighted. I’ve been in abusive relationships. I’ve got abusive parents, that are also narcissistic, that also would still gaslight me at every available opportunity if I gave them the chance anymore.

That being said, here are the actual reasons I don’t think Christian was outright gaslighting her (and I’m going to go off assumption about which points you’re referring to). 

Beginning of the movie, when she calls him about her sister. She herself has anxiety, so she already gets way too worked up over small things. Her sister is bi-polar, and is stated by Christian and agreed upon by Dani that she *does* have attention seeking tendencies. So put yourself in Christians shoes. Your gf calls you upset and anxious (something common you have probably dealt with in 4 years of dating her), tells you about how her sister is acting (also what you are accustomed to hearing, as according to the movie her sister does this shit all the time). So if I were Christian, I would try to calm my gf down, first and foremost, and do that by explaining that this is not a new sort of occurrence. What I Wouldn’t do, is when he said “it’s because u let her act this way.” That’s not helpful to anyone in the moment, regardless of the possibility of whether it’s valid or not. But that’s not gaslighting. That’s him trying to calm her down, followed by his (albeit shitty) opinion. He’s not making her doubt her sense of reality in order to manipulate her, which is what gaslighting is. In real life, not a movie that we are all as an audience aware is going to get bad, you’re first thought isn’t going to be “holy shit my gf’s sister is going to kill herself.” And if you know you can’t convince anyone to get therapy, or help in any real immediate way, I would argue the best possible thing u can do is calm your SO down, considering no one has any info. 

Secondly after the couple commits suicide. Her response is basically these people are crazies and we gotta get outta here. Again, in real life, where you don’t already know the characters are doomed, our first thought isn’t going to be “they are gonna kill us all,” and a student that studies a bunch of wacky tribes is going to write it off *to themselves first* as just a weird kinda fucked up thing this group has been doing, and that their own morals simply don’t jive that way. I don’t fully recollect their conversation right after that, so I could be missing something. I just again, don’t see him inflecting his own opinion that they aren’t evil people as him “gaslighting” her just because he disagrees. Also again, what is he supposed to do? Agree with all her fears, which he’s been accustomed to see for the last 4 years that they aren’t based in reality? She had a bad gut feeling, and it was right, but disagreeing with someone’s gut feeling, especially when they have a disorder that activates “negative gut feeling” all the time with lack of true evidence, is not outright telling someone what they just witnessed didn’t happen. If I were him, I’d pretty much agree I was shocked and sickened, but where do I get off saying these people that like how they live are “evil” for committing suicide at 72?

The third part I can actually remember is when that other couple splits and the guy “leaves”. Dani is worried about (I forget their names because I’m dumb) the guy’s wearabouts, then just outright thinks he left because he’s shitty. Again, in real life, I’m not gonna assume “omg this tribe of people totally killed him,” and I’m also not gonna assume off of one singular instance that there is some major issue in another couple, and I’m also not gonna assume (like Dani does) that some other couples possible dysfunction has anything to do with my own relationship. And also, insert the same spiel that Dani has an anxiety condition, which makes her gut feelings hyper vigilant to the point of malignancy (why it’s called anxiety disorder and not ‘super woke about everything’ virtue). 

There’s also the part where he’s talking to that dude, and she has a panic moment, and comes to talk to Christian. He’s in the middle of the conversation, and I think her wording is important. She never mentions she’s panicking. Or worried. She just makes a comment about the other couple (if I remember correctly). That’s not effective communication. How is he to know “oh shit she’s panicking,” and not just “she’s focused on this other couple.” Again, if I myself were Christian, and my gf walked up to me and just said something off hand about some other couple, yes my internal response would be “ok, why tf does this supersede my conversation I’m in the middle of having.” Had she said “hey I’m really worried about this thing,” my response would be “oh shit, hold this thought guy, I gotta talk to my gf.” But she doesn’t do that. Her delivery just sounds like she’s complaining about some gossipy bullshit about other people. So by him doing the basic “gee idk,” response and getting back to his convo, and then her immediately leaving (so again, no ‘babe I’m really worried,’ just a ‘k bye’ body language response), he doesn’t at any point deny her sense of reality in order to manipulate or belittle her. Which is what gaslighting is. 

Those are the instances that immediately come to mind. He definitely seems totally checked out and like he doesn’t give a shit. I’ll give u that. But it’s also already expressed he’s been wanting to break up with her for a while, so yes that’s basically what happens with emotional distance. In not one of those circumstances tho does he decide to deny her sense of reality to manipulate her or lower her own self worth. 

If there’s instances that seem major, and I’m totally missing them, bring them up, those are the ones that come to mind tho where I think they could be seen as gaslighting due to his nonchalance, but he doesn’t actually manipulate her or belittle her or cause her to doubt her own sanity. Not validating someone when you think they are being irrational to the point it hurts them is not gaslighting, intentionally *making* them doubt themselves, or using their already present self doubt to manipulate them is. 

Again, and I can’t stress this enough, I haven’t had such good discourse about a new movie in a long time. I think it’s because both characters are written so well, and with such realistic issues and traits, that both could be related to, depending on where u fall on a spectrum and your own life happenings. I still think Christian is shitty. I’m not setting this up as a “in Christians defense,” this response is solely for the purpose of why I personally don’t see those listed instances as “gaslighting.”",c7y18a

esyf9rh,"Totally agree with your comment in your edit. That said, 2 things. 

1. The semantics of this matter because of the way it’s been marketed, go back and watch the trailers and couple that with the the fact that hereditary was an instant horror classic, everyone (myself included) has gone in expecting something much along the lines of hereditary. The ‘HOLY FUCK’ kinda horror movie. I think you can agree that is not this film. 

2. The heart of the film is a breakup, Everything else (the horror, the humor and the setting). Work to heighten and tell that story in an emotionally novel way. Anyone who’s watched enough film knew where this was going pretty early on (Aster says as much). But how we get there is what he wanted to make new. The breakup, by the characters own admission should’ve happened before we ever even meet them. We watch it playout in a creepy cultish commune that provide some of the horror elements (the old people jumping, the bloody eagle). But I think those elements are certainly an important avenue for explaining the heart of it: breaking up with a long term significant other. You ‘lose’ their friends, in this movie quite literally. And in the process find a new set of friends, and in that Dani finds the guy that ‘was there all along’. But they’re not the story itself, the horror of hereditary is the heart of the story, it’s ‘holy shit this is all real and their family never had a chance’. 

So i don’t think it’s like u say placing some arbitrary line in the sand, but recognizing that horror isn’t the heart of the story. It’s a tool used to tell that in a novel way.",c7y18a

If it was an Aztec cult I would not ask for more context because it would be pretty much self explanatory what is going on there. However, the cult in this movie was totally made up by the screenwriter/ director using Swedish folklore and historical stories of other cults. They threw in some hints (the circle of life, holy tree, oracle etc.) but no explanation or context for this at all.    

 My next big issue with this (as I wrote in my starting post of this discussion) is that I simply don't buy that the people from the cult are able to stick to these traditions when the celebration occurs only every 90 years. This means that they are able to do these horrible things when they can possibly experience the celebration including human sacrifice only one time in their life. On the other side, Human sacrifice was very common for the Aztec.

Dude, again, too emotional... You assume there’s nothing but lust there, but his fear clearly overrides his excitement/hopes. It’s conveyed repeatedly. You’d look over too if you were about to engage in unconsentual ritual sex with someone, it doesnt prove he was 100% down. You neglect all of his following body language, confusion, facial expressions, the trance/spell he was under and the fact that he bounced like a frightened dog as soon as he nutted... just to fit your narrative. And you think idk the cinematography is a technique Aster uses to aid his story telling? Gtfoh.

How does Dani care about other people? Lol. I’m not being demeaning, she’s obviously a shattered individual, but she doesn’t do anything for anyone this entire movie. She really only thinks of herself. Nobody “tortured” Dani, lol. And she neglects herself! Always suppressing her emotions, always hiding, always turning to drugs.

Judging a character solely through the lens of his relationship based on the closing 2-3 weeks is just silly. Not even calling Christian positive, just no shittier than his pals or Dani.  Christian made many sacrifices for Dani even after he was checked out of the relationship, what’d she ever do for him?

Side note: Kyle McLachlan's character in Blue Velvet is exactly what I'm talking about. The film frames him (and the community he comes back to) as innocent and serene, but he and the town are anything but. The fight for his soul is the fight for the soul of the small town. MacLachlan is basically a stand in for the setting in the way the characters in Midsommar are not.

Then he was very understanding even tho she obviously wasn't stable enough to go on that trip. When she wanted to say no to drugs, he did too. He let her spend alone time when she needed and was there to comfort her when she came back. He never once snapped at her for ruining his guy trip (who the fuck would invite themselves to a trip like that?!). He was constantly checking on her to see if she was OK (like after the cliff scene.). Did she ever ask him if he was OK or how he was handling things? And she cheated on him first when she kissed that guy (right in front of him?!?). They both sucked but I think drugging and burning someone alive is slightly more toxic.",c7y18a
et4ttml,"I got the feeling that Dani wanted to get the entire event out of her head where as the mom in Hereditary wouldn't let anyone let it go, plus the daughter was a little girl and killed in such a macabre display, it was quite wrenching, plus she found the headless body in the car, so it's quite different. I'm not trying to change your mind because I can't, but I also don't think this had much focus on familial ties as much as Hereditary and the other reddit posters presume.",c7y18a
et5zjbf,"Interesting, I'm opposite this feeling. I don't need imagery nor t know anyone's family to be enthralled by mass loss can affect a person even if I know nothing about them, especially if they're alone. (<-That's no dig towards you just in case, I'm just kinda sensitive) I don't think their deaths were supposed to mean anything more than sadness for Dani, others think she craves family or closeness but I didn't think it was supposed to be anymore than just depression, although I do feel like the film was missing something...

When Ari was asked what his next film would be about after Hereditary..he stated ""A breakup"" which he took from his own life because he apparently had one recently, although I wonder where he would place himself in this film.. He also state this film would be more straight forward than Hereditary as well. 

I seems like he may have a thing for leaving out important details that inform the viewers what exactly his vision is throughout some of his films. I wonder if it's purposeful or somewhat lazy.

Anyway reasons to go to the cinema is for a good story and to be entertained/to be disturbed in this case. Not for some cinematography and music?

How can a horror movie still be scary in the daytime? etc. etc. etc. I think the suggestion is that these feelings can overlap. It's our (critical) job to sort them out.

f3f8zn8,"“Staying and smiling”? I thought someone else’s whole argument about this and Hereditary was the lack of control the characters have and their predetermined fate. Dani was always going to be the Queen and always going to stay. Not on her own cognizant but because she was drugged out of her mind. She really had no character arc, never deals with the grief of her family as much as she’s drugged into placation and into forgetting about it.",c7y18a

eso7njo,"Dani has revenge on her mind which is a very human thing to do in a situation like that. I should have brought that up in my earlier posts but it was like 2 am last night. Revenge is a very powerful thing as history has shown. People have killed spouses, themselves, and the lover of the cheater in those situations. Is it wrong? Of  course but it is believable, understandable and human. I don't think she was under the influence anymore when she chose Christian to die. She was just incredibly hurt and angry upon seeing her boyfriend cheating (from her perspective). Her initial response to discovering it was violent as she pukes, wails, and screams as she did when her family died. That was a profound pain for her as he was her only ""family"" left and he committed the ultimate betrayal (in her eyes). The revenge aspect made her vulnerable to accepting the cult. She has been assimilated.",c7y18a
eta9zg8,"I feel like the only reason you would say that is if you see her decision at the end as some kind of empowering, ""you go, girl"" moment, and that's definitely not what that was. It's not a happy ending. She's not empowered, liberated, or enlightened. She's been drugged and manipulated by a cult and she's finally broken down as a person and succumbed to their influence. Yes, she smiles at the end because it's a cathartic moment for her and she's finally been allowed to feel the feelings she's been suppressing the entire movie--but that doesn't mean this was a good way to get there or that she did the right thing! She burned the man alive--that is not okay! And it's not meant to be seen as such. Her being under the influence of drugs doesn't ""detract"" from her decision or the impact of the ending because it's part of what factored into it. She's not in her right mind at all, and it's still for the same reasons as before: she was in a co-dependent relationship that wasn't good for her and which forced her to suppress her emotions until she was ready to snap. They just gave her those few final little pushes she needed to get there.",c7y18a

During the entire May Queen sequence, the shots from her perspective always include the breathing warping visual effect and the breathing/moving flowers on her crown, up until the time when she gets back from blessing the meat and corn that they bury.

Once she returns and starts asking what’s going on in the sex room, those effects are gone. So starting from sometime before her discovery of Christian in the mating ritual and afterwards, it can be inferred that the effects of the drug have dissipated and that she has come down off her trip. There may be some residual effects, but she is off her high when she decides Christian’s fate and definitely while the temple is burning down.",c7y18a

My issue with the film had been that cult parts felt so unrealistic for the non-Swedish characters to be so often just ambivalent or slightly averse at best to such acts and situations. I didn't find anything really built off of those scenes, since we already had plenty of imagery and dialogue setting up the cult aspect for the end of the film (which I did genuinely enjoy the last twenty or so minutes of). For me, the breakup theme of the film felt like a triangular hole and the cult setting came across as a trapezoid block that was trying to pushed through that hole.",c7y18a

I'm not calling for a ban of the movie or a boycott of the director or anything crazy. I'm not a victim. I chose to see the movie. But I don't see how you can say it wasn't a rape scene:

Boyfriend doesn't want to be in relationship. Girlfriend's parents and sister die horrifically. Boyfriend decides it's a bad time to break up. On vacation, boyfriend forgets birthday and looks at hot chick. Cult member offers him drugs. He refuses. She pressures him. He relents and drinks the drugs. He is clearly uncomfortable. In his drugged out state, he is lead to a cabin where more drugs are forced upon him. In another room, the girl is naked, waiting, with other naked women surrounding her. He doesn't feel he has any choice but to have sex. In his confusion, one of the ladies holds his hand, singing to him, encouraging him to complete the mission. At one point, another lady physical forces him into the girl. Afterwards, he's completely freaked out, drugged again, sewn in to a bear suit and burned alive.

I think I was pretty objective in my description there. I tried not to exaggerate or embellish. Whether you like the movie, and that scene in particular, or not is irrelevant, I don't see how you can objectively say that wasn't rape. And if you reversed all the male/female pronouns in my synopsis, I don't think anyone would even think to argue it wasn't rape, and certainly wouldn't have been laughing during that scene.

I thought the movie was dumb and boring, not because of that scene, but because it dragged on for so long and the plot was a pretty typical sacrificial cult story. I just thought the sex scene was ridiculous and made me like the movie even less. The fact that I can see there was a rape scene in the movie, and I didn't like it, doesn't make my thinking toxic.

""These pastorally-minded people drugging, brainwashing, kidnapping, torturing, and murdering tourists can be compared to modernity's passive acceptance of motor vehicle deaths."" I mean, what?? The point of having one of the characters be a naive anthropology student, and having that character meet a particularly grisly fate, is to underscore that this sort of morally-disaffected intellectualizing is severely blinding. It's a dangerous path to go down.

Looking back at [the original comment I responded to](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/c7y18a/official_discussion_midsommar_spoilers/esn2b9e/), I do not object to the idea that the film demonstrates ""the importance of sharing grief with family and friends who care about you."" What I object to is the notion that this was somehow *achieved* by participating in the cult's fucked up rituals. The OP describes ""the other women all mirroring the main character crying... all try\[ing\] to feel her pain to help her heal,"" but this doesn't make any sense. What the other women were doing -- it was performative. It was bullshit. It was a farce of what empathy looks like.

Dani's descent into total depravity supports this notion. Trying to deal with your grief by leaning into arbitrary practices, performative gestures, superficial human connections (and let's not forget drugs!) -- it's not real. It's unhealthy. It's corrosive to the soul. The film is not about finding ways to heal after trauma and grief. It's a cautionary tale about the danger of trying to escape it -- about the danger of *not* healing.",c7y18a

It was clear (to him and others) that she was romantically interested in him and he never once made an effort to stop it. It was mentioned previously in the film that he was wanting to end things with Dani and his friends even brought up the idea of him being free to finally have sex with other women. Throughout the film he constantly shows how little he cares about Dani and the fact that he's only with her due to guilt mostly.  All of these things are clues that he would cheat, given the circumstance, because of his indifference to his current girlfriend and the fact that a young, attractive girl was interested in him. After all, he turned his back on his friend when it meant standing in between him and his thesis. He truly had no loyalty.  

If anything, it's not like he didn't know what to expect when he went off to follow the girl alone in a building. Like I said before, if he wasn't drugged, he most likely wouldn't have been cool with the weird ritual aspect of the sex and wouldn't have gone through with it. I can agree with that.

Personally I think whatever journey Dani goes on internally is the most important one to take away. The motives of the cult are considerably less important. Florence Pugh speaks about the madness taking over and her not even comprehending the reality of what’s happening. Which I’d compare to something like the end of Brazil or One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, which portray unconventional takes on being “free”, either from madness or death. In Cuckoos Nest it’s Chief who makes that choice for him. And in Midsommar, Pelle and the cult know what’s best for Dani.

Not saying in Midsommar it all adds up to a satisfying trajectory, but I think the ending isn’t the biggest problem there. It ties pretty well into the family tragedy opening for me.",c7y18a

And for the record, she is not taking pills for depression. She’s taking Ativan, which is prescribed for flare ups of anxiety (you know, the kind of anxiety that comes from a loved one expressing suicidal ideation and then immediately becoming unreachable) and is not something that is taken regularly for a clinical diagnosis. She’s not clinically depressed or bipolar like her sister, she’s processing the grief that came from one of the most traumatic experiences of her life.

You seem to have fallen firmly into defense of this dude and have interpreted everything Dani does as the actions of some emotionally draining harpy. You’re basically agreeing with Mark’s line at the beginning of it being “basically abuse” (which, for the record, the movie plays as a laugh line because it’s clearly an *absurd statement*). But the text of the film doesn’t support this read in any way shape, or form. We are constantly shown the way Dani is consistently undermining her own feelings to be agreeable or to not make waves (how many times does she try to bring up some shitty thing Christian is doing only to end up apologizing herself?), and Christian is consistently opting for easy outs or lazy platitudes whenever the profound grief or trauma she’s still processing starts to rear its head (he basically bails on her after the Attestupa to go catch up with his buds under the guise of “giving her alone time” when she is *clearly not okay* and just watched two people die in front of her).",c7y18a

Christian repeatedly telling his friends that ""I invited her, but she's not coming"" right before she enters the room is another indicator of him not being the best communicator. We don't know enough about him but the relationship already seems codependent, and Dani even doubts his intentions in the phonecall with her friend.

All of those moments where we see him being empathetic to her, are only slightly redeeming. The guy let her nap in a field for six hours after having a shroom-fueled panic attack and forgot her birthday. When Maja kicks him during the dance, Dani notices and he decides to join.

I'm not saying my interpretation is perfect, but since the second opinion was based on (I believe) a deeper understanding of the work, I would call it more valid than the first. If I had hated the movie because I totally misinterpreted it and thought it was about aliens or something, that opinion wouldn't be valid at all.

Other than that we have the dialogue from Christian's perspective, a character shown to be pretty neglecting and a bit of an asshole. That's it, yet somehow she is the clingy bitch.

eth24fk,">she was never tortured, lied to, or drugged

She was drugged prior to the dancing, hence the subtle psychedelic visuals (breathing flowers, swirling grass, etc.)

It's not as bad as other torture they committed, but they injured her emotionally by drugging her boyfriend and making him have sex with the redhead, leading to the scene where she's devasted by seeing this. 

And based on how they treat other loyal community members (ritual suicide, head bashing, burning alive, being lied to about being given a drug to make the fire painless), it's safe to say that anyone who stays in the community will become a victim eventually.

I mean, they're literally the bad guys in a horror movie. I don't know how much more clear it could be that they're pure evil under the surface.

Dani might not have seen the drugging or other things as negative at the time. But that's how cults work in real life. They make people feel good, valued, and important. They provide a sense of belonging that looks and feels completely authentic. Then, once new members are locked in, committed, cut off from outside connections, and unable to leave, that's when shit gets real.",c7y18a

“Alright sorry.”

“No don’t be sorry. I just wanna talk about it.”

“No I’m sorry.” 

I’m really not trying to be difficult here, but idk if I can say for sure that that’s gaslighting. Seems more like a miscommunication, then Christian being butthurt he is pretty much at fault, and he tries to ‘apologize’ (not really he just wants to leave) and then dip out. She had a lot of options. She chose to say sorry. I don’t really see him denying reality, unless we are led to believe that they actually never had a conversation and he is just pushing to slowly change goalposts and get his answer. Maybe it’s intentionally ambiguous about their past, so that way both characters will continue to be relatable with the audience members’ past experiences. If that’s basically his constant tactic, and a female audience member dated a dude like that, it would be reasonable to say Christian was written as a gaslighter, and always argues that way. 

The way I saw it is that he was gonna be a dick, dip out to Sweden, and then break up with her that way. Dick move, and dishonest af. He’s a prick. I just don’t see the moving parts of gaslighting involved in that. However I sparsely remember how that actual convo went.

et3lfuc,"I appreciate these thoughts. I do understand the concept of unconventional closure in film (and books). Hereditary, for me, is the perfect example of a well-executed ending that is both disturbing yet provides consolation to the viewer. In many ways, Hereditary is very similar to Midsommar. Both films deal with grief, family loss/estrangement, and community. The difference, for me, is that I really buy into the ending of Hereditary. It has the same sense of inevitability, but when Annie and her children are united under Paimon I feel a profound sense of relief. 

What's missing in Midsommar is that emotional pay-off, IMO. Not that a film is obligated to have a ""happy ending,"" so to speak, but with a character like Dani, who we were made to identify with and pity throughout the film, I was craving a similar sort of release. I don't find her resolution with Christian (i.e. his death sentence) to be satisfying. I don't really buy Reynor's comment that there is any ambiguity surrounding whether or not she chose Christian—the evidence just isn't there for me. Other than the fact that we aren't shown her choice, at this point the cult has no reason not to follow through on their word to sacrifice the person of her choosing. 

I guess the third act was all a little bit sloppy to me. What I really would have liked to see is Dani connecting with the cult more throughout Midsommar. The film creates an interesting contrast between the men's superficial, academic, interests in the community, and Dani's more organic curiosity. If she had spent more time participating in festivities or more time alone, immersing herself in the cult, I think the ending would have made a lot more sense and would have seemed a lot more logical. Instead, the brunt of her transformation happens during the maypole dance. Again, this may be an intentional choice but I just don't think it works as well. Haha this might be a bit rambly but I'm still trying to work through/articulate my thoughts on this movie.",c7y18a

Lots of ritualized “initiations” that were framed as fun traditions. Lots of in-group/out-group dynamics. And a lot of authorities who were “appointed by God” keeping people like me in a state of perpetual adolescence. You weren’t really perceived as an adult until you were married with children. Everyone else needed an older, wiser spiritual leader to think for them. At the time, it just felt like mentorship. 

I could go on and on. They were really good at making things seem socially acceptable and normal, but when you add it all together, it was insanely fucked up. And when you have little interaction with the outside world to norm it with, you lose perspective.

The 9 sacrifices are:

Two prior sacrifices who have sticks coming out of them and are carried into the barn. 

Two living volunteers. 

I forget their names at this point, but guy who's caught taking pictures, guy who pees on the tree, two Brits, and the boyfriend.

et0u4p8,"Neither have I. People in this thread haven't really skirted around the rape question at all. I have seen people in other threads talk about how cathartic it is to watch Christian die, which is (to me, anyway) a strange take.

There's also a segment in this Slate article ([https://slate.com/culture/2019/07/midsommar-ending-orgy-bear-suit-reaction.html](https://slate.com/culture/2019/07/midsommar-ending-orgy-bear-suit-reaction.html)) which shows some of what I'm talking about: 

>the orgy in particular inspired an almost uncomfortable amount of laughter at my screening. But when Reynor came onstage afterward, he wasn’t laughing. At first, I thought it must be uncomfortable to be paraded in front of a large crowd that just watched you run around naked on a 30-foot screen. (Understandable!) But when Reynor got the mic, he had a question for the crowd. “How many of you think Christian deserved that?” he asked. Many hands shot up, including a woman next to me in the front row. He shook his head and said, “Shame on you.”",c7y18a
et40eao,"Basically, there are a few things that make the movie somewhat disappointing to me:

1. The characters feel underwritten. They fit standard horror movie archetypes. Pelle is the shady foreigner (Hostel). Mark is the jerk who gets one of the most brutal (offscreen) deaths (see: every generic horror movie). Josh is the ostensibly smart one who makes incredibly poor decisions. All of them, in fact, don't seem to recognize this isolated pagan community as a cult despite the fact that Pelle seemed to say absolutely nothing about their rituals being genuine.
2. Once the actual horror movie gets going, nothing is a surprise. The archetypes settle, and we know that each character is going to die as they get separated from the group. I was honestly surprised that their deaths were so formulaic.
3. The heart of the movie is ostensibly Dani and Christian's relationship. Everything before the ritual suicides worked for me in that direction. We can see them go back and forth between toxicity and dependence. Most of that got muddy for me once they get divided by the cult. We spend more time watching archetypal characters get axed. Consequently, there doesn't seem to be much going on to Dani beyond her grief and Christian beyond his, uh, blockheadedness. Nobody does grief like Ari Aster, so Dani works as a character for me. Christian seems just like another flavor of dumb and selfish that also felt horribly convenient for the plot. I wish we could have spent more time with Dani and Christian--Maybe even a little on what made their relationship special beforehand?--and less with the formulaic characters. The ending would have felt more impactful and less like something done for pure shock value, then. I honesty would be fine with all the outsiders except for Christian and Dani getting cut from the movie.
4. This is a totally separate thing from characterization, but an incredibly amount of this movie is taken from the 1973 version of The Wicker Man. The very first shot and the ending are nearly one-to-one recreations of the opening and the ending. I certainly expected some influences from and homages to The Wicker Man, but I didn't expect what felt almost like a soft remake of it. (I feel like I may be in the minority in this, but Hereditary REALLY surprised me with its direction, so I had hoped for something less derivative. It hits all the familiar beats of a creepy cult movie.)

Sorry, I know that's a lot. I recognize also that some of these may be nitpicks. I really like Aster as a director--he clearly has visions for his movies--so I feel like I need to process what worked for me and what didn't. I'd be interested in what you think too, though.",c7y18a

f1qj006,"I just did not like this movie, honestly. I came into it with high expectations (I didn't have any expectations about what it was going to be about necessarily, but I thought it was going to be good) and it simply disappointed to me. I thought the first hour was interesting, but it started to fall flat for me after awhile. I can't remember exactly when, but I think it's when all the friends started disappearing and it we were just left with Dani and Christian that I lost interest in this movie (and there was a whole hour and 30 minutes still left to go). It's like they barely showed any curiosity or concern as to where their friends went. You have all these people disappearing, the English couple (I wish they survived) and two of your friends, and you're not even a little disturbed by that? And this is happening in a remote community that seems very cult like and you've just met all of these community members? These are the same people who think jumping off a cliff 30 feet high and bashing their elders heads in with mallets are ""peaceful send offs"". I'd rather just die from natural causes relating to aging than that shit. It's like they weren't picking up on the clues that something was amiss and that they were likely going to end up dead, too. Another example of this is when they're at the lunch table and none of the cult members are eating their food or talking. They're just staring at the protagonists. I understand that they're anthropologists, which is likely making them less fazed by the cult members weird behaviors, but  it's not like they previously stated that there's a custom of not talking during lunch time or that they wait for the guests to eat first before they start eating. It was really weird, and I'm surprised that not even one of them turned to the other friend and whispered ""Why aren't these people eating and instead just staring at us?""

Also, I just didn't feel very connected to these characters at all to the point where I didn't care if they all just died. Not only were they extremely oblivious, but they barely felt like people and just mere characters added to a story simply because the story needed characters. Like, Matt (was that his name, I don't even know) what was the point of his character? All he did was vape during the little screen time he had, but most of the time, that dude was MIA. He was pointless. I just wish we got to know them a little better or at least given a reason to root for them. Most of the characters' deaths were off screen, which I kind of get because the movie wanted to create suspense and speculation surrounding what happened to them, but it didn't do a good job at that. I think what would've made it more eerie is if the remaining characters questioned the cult members about what happened to their friends, and possibly caught the cultists in a lie or something. Have a moment where Dani or Christian finally realize that something in the pudding ain't right and that they need to make an escape plan and haul ass up out of there, but that doesn't happen.

I kind of liked Dani at first, and I felt for her after she lost her family and she knew that her boyfriend had mentally checked out of their relationship, but she kind of lost me at the end. I understand that by that point, she was deeply traumatized and mentally broken, but girl, letting your paralyzed boyfriend get burned to death? Christian wasn't the greatest boyfriend ever and he was entitled an prick when he stole Josh's thesis idea and then tried to say that he had nothing to do with him when the Elders Scroll (?) disappeared, but that doesn't mean he deserves to die. I thought the shot of her walking and hysterically crying as she realized her decision was beautifully done, but then it was ruined when it showed her smiling. She just went full cuckoo by that point, which was incredibly sad. I get it, the film is trying to show that Dani has found herself a new home and family after she lost hers, but I wish we saw more scenes of her bonding with the cult members or maybe there should've been a younger girl in the cult who reminded her of her sister.  I suppose the scenes of her synchronized wailing with the cult members were supposed to give us that impression.  And I guess you can understand why Dani did was she did because from her perspective, Christian looked like he was cheating, but we the viewers knew that he was just under the red head girl's spell and influence. But like, couldn't she also tell how off he was at the dinner table after she was crowned May Queen? I don't know, but whatever. Speaking of Dani becoming May Queen, I thought that scene was incredibly long and repetitive. I understand why it was so long. The ""game"" they play to determine the Queen is a long process, but I got really bored watching it. The baby making scene was really long, too, and disturbing and gratuitous.

Also, Pelle's characterization was slightly confusing to me. I thought there was going to be some sort of twist, and he was revealed to be an actual normal person who was simply brainwashed. Maybe he wasn't born into the cult. He was an outsider who was brought there just like how he did with his friends. I thought maybe something in him was going to switch. He seemed to have genuinely cared about Dani, and I'm not going to lie, I kind of wanted to see them together because their scenes were cute. Maybe I was just naive. He ended up being a bad guy, of course, and I'm not quite sure why so many people who watched this film, girls/women specifically, are romanticizing his character. He brought his friends to his village as human sacrifices and preyed on a mentally ill girl because he knew she had just lost her family and her boyfriend didn't love her anymore. Yikes. But that's not really a criticism of the film per se, just my initial confusion about Pelle and his motivations.

Another thing that I did not like, is how the inbred person didn't play a bigger role in the story? It felt like he was simply added to show how far removed from reality the cult members are to really think that mentally impaired and physically deformed people are some magical beings sent from above. Initially, I thought we were supposed to laugh at them, but then there would be this twist that revealed that they were really onto something. I forgot the person's name so excuse me for referring to them as ""the inbred"", but I thought he was really going to be some sort of prophet and the movie was going to take a sort of supernatural twist. That the sacrifices did really mean something, the souls of the people who died at 72 were really reincarnated, and Matt pissing on the ancestral tree all awakened some sort of entity and all of this was prophesied by the inbred boy. I don't know, maybe you didn't get that same impression, but again, this was when I had an hour left into the movie and I was clinging onto just about  to happen, so the film could be more eventful. I just wanted the movie to be over by that point.

**TLDR; This movie started off interesting in the first hour, but it fell flat for me soon after. I didn't like the obliviousness of the characters or their unnatural reactions to what was happening in the cult or people's mysterious disappearances, which made it hard for me to root for them.  I think there could've been more moments of Dani building a relationship with the cult members to really hone in the message that she had found a sense of peace and family in them. The ceremonial and ritual scenes were too long and repetitive. The inbred boy should've played a more significant role, but instead, he ended up being used as a simple horror movie trope to give the movie a ""creep factor"".  Lastly, the film really should've been an hour shorter.**

If it makes it any better, I rated it a 4/10 in the poll, mostly gave it that score because I loved the cinematography, aesthetic/imagery, and Florence's acting. That's about it, though. Those things don't make an overall solid movie or make up for everything I just complained about. The film just did not come together nicely to me. It was extremely vague in a lot of areas, the pacing was really off, and I'm not seeing whatever ""artistic masterpiece"" this is supposed to be. Simply because it played heavily on symbolism to seem deep (which is one of the reasons why I didn't like Us, by the way), but really just came off as pretentious? I think not.",c7y18a

That's why I asked the other poster to not turn this shit into something it wasn't because it's not that deep. You're trying to make me out as I was taking this deeply when I really wasn't, but it seems to me that you and the other neckbeards responding to me are the ones taking offense. I wasn't even aggressive in my reply to the person or foming at the mouth. It was literally one sentence? I have other things that are worth more being upset about than a random person on the Internet not liking my opinion.

Is there not a difference between saying ""I disagree with you about this being the worst movie this year because I've seen worse releases this year"" and saying ""Your opinion is too harsh because there have been worse movies released this year"". That makes it sound like it's a fact when it's not, and I was simply telling that person that might be the case for them but it's not for me. What is so problematic about that?

He probably sees himself as low maintenance and self sufficient and resents Dani for so much hubbub and drama, and feels like the victim in a way (because he's also a narcissist). He didn't tell Dani yet because he was planning to break up with her beforehand, but he couldn't find the perfect time to break it to her (probably hoping for her to give him a way out). He really wanted to avoid the potential blowup and possibility of pushing her over her emotional cliff. His complete inability to deal with confrontation or emotional turmoil was why he wanted to leave right away and hope it would blow over or that she pulls the plug on their relationship so he doesn't have to. But he's so hellbent on the path of least resistance that he sits and talks to her when she challenges that. Without the emotional intelligence to navigate the conversation, or more likely unable to make everything better, he throws the Hail Mary and invites her to join him to Sweden as a proof to him not being a bad boyfriend/person, which obviously wasn't sincere.

Your thoughts about how Dani’s arc could have been strengthened to better exemplify her growing connection to the cult are good and is just about how I feel with the entire middle act of Hereditary, which kind of abandons a lot of tension in favor of a pretty hackneyed subplot with Anne Dowd’s obvious cult member and dramatic wheel spinning til the third act rolls around. The end is a really tremendous set piece but I felt pretty disconnected emotionally by that point. I think if Annie had been written a bit more likable and wise to what’s happening (confronting more personal demons and without the silly Anne Dowd stuff), her eventual possession and demise would have been much more satisfying for me. Ditto Peter being mostly comatose throughout, to the point where his blank expression at the end means not much more.

I do think that Ari Aster’s extensive background with short film is betrayed a bit by his character work in the features. Like his first and third acts tell a good arc, but there’s not enough development to cover 2+ hours. Just something to think about.",c7y18a

etxadiq,"No really. Everything they did was reactionary until the very end when Dani made a choice between Christian and the other guy. And at that point it didn't even feel like there was any impact on that choice because they had barely interacted for the past 30 minutes of the movie. Who gives a shit that she chose Christian? He sucked. But he didn't suck in a way that made you want him dead, he sucked in a way that just made you indifferent to him. 

All the characters just let things happen to them.",c7y18a

But he’s also caught in a situation where he’s being told by his questionable friends that he should leave his needy gf all while instinctually feeling like he has some obligation to help her in crisis. He’s selfish, much like everyone else.

The ritual they trick him to — assuming as I think it’s meant to be that his participation was entirely involuntary (ie there was some form of witchcraft involved) — I really felt bad from that. 

Interesting too is the juxtaposition of his silence in the end to the two Swedes surprised horror because it’s just one more way the community chooses to never empathize with an outsider as they do with their own.",c7y18a

f3ebi27,"Because mulatto is more descriptive. Where those two came from was mentioned maybe once in the entire movie and it was tiny irrelevant detail that many may have missed. Moreover, it isn't even explicitly stated that they are in fact nationals. Could by migrants or illegals in which case such a descriptor would not only be obscure but also wrong. Conversely, the fact the couple were mulattoes is readily observable every second they appear on screen.

f1w0awj,"The key to to unlocking the movie for me was understanding the philosophy of the cult. Check out my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/c7y18a/official_discussion_midsommar_spoilers/euw00hw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), but the main idea is they accept the ugly, inevitable aspects of life (like death) and publicly ritualize them instead of keeping them in the shadows. The cult would argue that these rituals allow people to grapple with grief in a healthier way than society as a whole allows.

This lens helps address some of your criticisms:

>These are the same people who think jumping off a cliff 30 feet high and bashing their elders heads in with mallets are ""peaceful send offs"". I'd rather just die from natural causes relating to aging than that shit.

The cult wouldn't call that sendoff ""peaceful,"" but they *would* argue it is preferable to a long, drawn-out death in a hospital. They would point out that the idea of dying from ""natural causes"" is itself a myth that our society uses to gloss over just how painful end-of-life can be.

>I thought the shot of her walking and hysterically crying as she realized her decision was beautifully done, but then it was ruined when it showed her smiling. She just went full cuckoo by that point, which was incredibly sad. 

I disagree that the smile suggests she went crazy. It shows that she's embraced the philosophy of the cult, but I think the movie is careful to show that even though the cult is *extreme*, their philosophy is *coherent*.

It's tempting to call the cult's final fire ceremony crazy, but it's just an even more extreme extension of this philosophy. Just like how the cult understands that death is inevitable, they go a step further and argue that even murder and suicide are inevitable. If you don't ritualize them in a fire ceremony, they will inevitably come out in other ways (see the sister's murder/suicide). They choose to have a society where these things are brought into the light, because it allows them to grieve communally in a way that broader society doesn't.

That brings us to Peele, one of the most interesting characters in the movie. He fully subscribes to the cult's philosophy, so when he recommends that Dani comes on the trip, he genuinely believes it will be good for her (and he's right). The fire ceremony is just as devastating to him as you would expect considering his brother burns alive, but he understands (or believes) that this is preferable to the alternative (Dani's sister's situation). He's not a ""bad guy,"" he's a guy with good intentions who subscribes to a very different philosophy.

The inbred person is just another manifestation of this philosophy. While society normally wouldn't accept someone that ""ugly"" and would see them as a dependent, the cult embraces the ugly and elevates him and gives him respect and power.

And the icing on the cake is all the horror is shot in a harsh, bright light, forcing you to see it exactly for what it is. That directly aligns with the cult's philosophy of dealing with pain publicly and out in the open. 

I agree with some of your other criticisms. The characters definitely weren't suspicious enough about all the disappearances, and the Mayflower dance slowed the pacing a little. But in the end, I think the movie succeeds in presenting a macabre but compelling alternative philosophy to our own, and it weaves that message into a totally unique look for horror.",c7y18a
