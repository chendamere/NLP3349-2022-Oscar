dh5e0ct,This is the second official discussion to coincide with US release. To see the international thread go here: https://redd.it/679svd,69by9z
dh5mai3,Drax explaining why it's better to be ugly because then you know for sure someone likes you was hilarious and almost reasonable.,69by9z
dh5smv2,"I laughed and cried and laughed a lot. I enjoyed the movie experience.

Yondu is a god damn Guardian.",69by9z
dh5e7yp,300 songs on the Zune oh the possibilities!,69by9z
dh5ro19,"Thought it was great. The ""do you have tape?"" scene in particular.",69by9z
dh73llc,"how is no one talking about teenage angst Groot, it was hilarious",69by9z
dh5sexa,Best shot in the film was Yondu's arrow taking out the lights and then taking out the guys.,69by9z
dh5p8kq,"Said it in the other thread too:

Yondu's arrow may be the coolest weapon in the MCU.",69by9z
dh8agtp,A moment to applaud James Gunn casually placing a brothel with sexbots in a Disney film. ,69by9z
dh5yzez,"In guardians 1 they performed an experiment: can we get people to care about these obscure characters. 

Guardians 2 they repeat the experiment to make sure it's not a fluke... focusing on Drax, Baby Groot, Mantis, Yondu and Nebula... and still elicit laughter and tears. 

Drunken with power they give Yondu a sidekick, even get the audience to fall in love with him. 

A cosmo the dog movie is not far off. ",69by9z
dh5kwvl,"The second they landed on ego I got a very heavy Futurama vibe when Leela goes to her homeworld 


Edit - ""homeworld""",69by9z
dh5e4p1,"The second I heard Stallone mumbling off-screen, I knew we were in for a good time.",69by9z
dh5gcua,They finally answered the question of why Drax never wears a shirt,69by9z
dh5epnr,"I think Dave Bautista stole the show. He nailed the comedic timing of his lines so well.

But the funniest moment was that severed toe joke with Groot. Holy shit, that had me in stitches.",69by9z
dh8uafh,"Since no one has mentioned it yet, my favorite joke in the entire movie was how the Sovereign's battle station floor was set up like an 80's video arcade complete with arcade sounds. It wasn't just a visual joke, it was a sound joke. A terrific sound joke. They even had at one point, the cliche of everyone gathering around the one awesome arcade player at the cabinet, cheering him on. ",69by9z
dh5sojb,The scene where mantis cried after touching drax was cool. Drax just tough as nails trying to look tough but was really super sad. ,69by9z
dh5ec74,"When they were skipping through hyperspace en route to Ego (just before Stan Lee's cameo), did we get a glimpse of the planet that Hulk is on in the next Thor? ",69by9z
dh5e87o,Can I pet your puppy?,69by9z
dh5wnon,"Underrated line:
""I didn't mean to mutiny. They killed all my friends...""",69by9z
dh5nt2z,"One of the things i was blown away with was how natural young Kurt Russell looked. Like, not creepy at all",69by9z
dh5p04i,"He may be your father, boy, but he ain't your daddy.",69by9z
dh5je8f,"""He was your father, but he wasn't your daddy"" ",69by9z
dh5m069,"Peter immediately shooting Ego after the big reveal was simultaneously heartbreaking, awesome and darkly humorous.

Holy shit.",69by9z
dh5ze4w,"Gunn's use of color is absolutely masterful.  Rich and vivid, *just* at the border of cartoonish without ever stepping past that line.

I haven't seen that kind of striking use of palette since Technicolor was around.  Brought me right back to that moment in Wizard of Oz when she steps out of the shack into a world of saturation.  Gunn has a true panache for bringing the kid in me and the adult in me both to the fore.",69by9z
dh5r4je,TIL: I'm attracted to people with gold skin.,69by9z
dh73v0p,"I've been thinking (maybe overthinking) a throwaway joke in the film, where Drax asks Quill 'I thought Yondu was your father' and Quill and Rocket are bemused by his supposed stupidity. Now that I think about it, given how absolutely literal minded Draw is I'm surprised by how he reacted to that (it seemed uncharacteristically dumb), but then later on when he tells Nebula 'No we're family' it shows that one of the things he has little trouble with understanding is the emotional bond between people that transcends labels like blood relations. Perhaps he already had an intuitive sense that while this new bearded fella technically looked a lot more like Peter, Yondu was the 'father'.

Btw, absolutely loved the film, saw it a week ago but just wanted to comment on how much I loved it again.",69by9z
dh5e6lf,I'm gonna make some weird shit.,69by9z
dh5e4hm,adam warlock and uatu the watcher's wikipedias gonna be blowin up tonight,69by9z
dh5e2tx,*You are beautiful... on the inside.*,69by9z
dh655ys,"The part where his dad tells him to form the energy into an object and he makes a ball and they play catch is one of the funniest, underrated moments in the movie.",69by9z
dh5nery,"""Mantis, look out!""",69by9z
dh5vgts,"I loved the Intro, and I thought it was adorable when Baby Groot waved at Gamora and she gave him a sort of motherly ""Hi :D"" ",69by9z
dh5egsk,Am I going crazy or was that Goldblum in the credits?,69by9z
dh5dzie,"""I am Mary Poppins y'all!!!""

That statement made me chuckle.",69by9z
dh5i3k3,"The entire scene were Yondu just absolutely slays all of the mutineers was incredibly well done, and in my opinion, one of my favorite parts of the movie. ",69by9z
dh5espy,[deleted],69by9z
dh5ee3p,The prices on old Zunes is about to go up.,69by9z
dh5gco1,"Honestly, I loved it.

It was a hell of a lot more emotional than the first with some fantastic character buildup. The whole Yondu and Starlord moment at the end was probably the most emotional scene in the movie and my favorite.

And that bad ass quill scene was awesome.

That twist ending with Quill's father got me, the way they handled that was fantastic. Also I loved the Yondu and Rocket moment, really great way for those two to bond.

And not to mention my favorite Stan Lee cameo to date. And ""I'm Marry Poppins ya'll!"" gave me a laugh.

All in all, really great addition to the franchise and cannot wait for part 3. 

EDIT: Did anyone just fucking love it when Ego was growing back his skin and organs and tissue and was a walking skeleton? The way they showed that was just great. ",69by9z
dh5e563,"In case anyone else was wondering, that thing the gold lady created at the end was Adam Warlock.",69by9z
dh6xmcd,I loved the symbolism of his mother dying from brain tumor that ego planted and ego dying from a bomb in his brain.,69by9z
dh5euch,"I'm just really, **really** happy they played 'Father and Son.'",69by9z
dh5nils,"Nice to see the adopted father, step father role being the hero and the real dad is the dick.",69by9z
dh5ecjw,"That ending was a lot more emotional than I expected. Yondu, why!!!!",69by9z
dh9dqri,The most bloodlust I ever had in these MCU movies was when Ego told Quill very casually he put the tumor in his mom. I never wanted a character to die so badly when that happened and the cathartic joy I got when Quill without the slightest hesitation blasted away at him for killing his mom,69by9z
dh5dzz7,"For as much as I love the ensemble in these movies and think that they all do a great job, Dave Bautista is the heart and soul of this franchise. He killed it. I hope he gets more work to show he's a good actor. More than just your usual meathead. I hope the third movie really focuses on him. I find Drax's story to be the most interesting of the five",69by9z
dh5kt6z,When Ego briefly turned into David Hasselhoff I was in stitches. Was not expecting that. ,69by9z
dh5el47,"-How metal was Ego reforming his body from scratch? The skeleton and blood forming, awesome. 

- Was Yondu the first truly 'earned' death in the MCU? 

-Zoe Saldana was super hot in this. 

-Uatu!?! ",69by9z
dh5my3j,"When they talked about how Yondu would never get the Ravager funeral, I was hoping and praying he wasn't going to die at the end. I had hope whenever he rescued Peter, I thought they were both gonna make it. And then I remembered the one spacesuit. I was holding back tears during the entire funeral scene. ",69by9z
dh5uynk,"Gutted Yondu isn't going to be in the next one, I thought he was fantastic throughout both films but I can understand they wouldn't really have anywhere to go from there. 

Only just realised reading through this sub the importance of the Zune. So his mothers last present to him was awesome mix vol2 that he got after she died and his adopted father's last present to him Zune after he died. It's just started raining in here. ",69by9z
dh5ejnl,[deleted],69by9z
dh5mihj,The most impressive part of the movie was that the Dairy Queen was still standing in the same spot 34 years later.,69by9z
dh5u74e,TASERFACE!!!,69by9z
dh5phyf,"I love how Quill instantly shoots his father. 

Edit: while we're at it, I understood Ego's motivation in making all planets into him but why did he kill Peter's mother again?",69by9z
dh5lcab,"I was worried Baby Groot would get old quick, but honestly once he started dancing to ELO in the beginning I was hooked, he was just too cute to hate.  I need a GIF of him throwing up now.",69by9z
dh5ebf4,"I like how they handled Rocket in this movie.

In Guardians 1 Rocket blew the rest out of the water. He was obviously the fan favorite. I was afraid they were going to take advantage of this and give Rocket some unnecessary fan servicey spotlight time. 

Instead they spread the spotlight around a fair bit. Everyone got their time to shine. I actually think Drax and Yondu stole the show in terms of funny lines and spotlight moments in this one. Rocket played a more reserved role but this role eventually reinforced the overall theme of family and his role within it. Very nice.

So good on you filmmakers for not making Rocket into the Daryl Dixon of the Marvel universe!",69by9z
dh5f27a,"Just got back from a packed theater that had a blast. I will say that the one part that might have gotten the most laughs was [When Rocket, Groot and Yondu jumped 700 times](#spoiler).",69by9z
dh5eln7,**I'm gonna make some weird shit**,69by9z
dh5r6k0,"Humility, I like that. I too am extraordinarily humble.",69by9z
dh6x060,"Can't believe nobody is talking about the young Kurt Russell scene. Holy fuck, they're getting good at that tech. 
",69by9z
dh5e8ny,"Boy do I love these two movies. James Gunn just really nails the team dynamic and creating a family. The Avengers is an awesome team but don't feel anything like the Guardians (not that they are supposed to) and allow their love for one another to be such a driving force. 

Yes, this movie was a little exposition heavy and yes the jokes and humor came close to being too much, but at the end of the day it was enjoyable and heartwarming. 

GotG2 gave us odd couples that really displayed why the characters are great as individuals but work so well as a team. It's super sad to see Yondu go, but I'm glad that they raised the stakes and not everyone got out alive. Gunn absolutely nailed how to send him out though and made it worth it. 

Also Adam Warlock and original Guardians/ Starhawk hype!! 

Edit: a letter",69by9z
dh5pkz0,This movie had a lot of heart. But specially Yondu realizing that the love he had for his son was the only thing that could redeem a life of regrets and Star-Lord knowing that he had a father and that he raised him as  the only way he ever knew,69by9z

dh5ur8r,The whole funeral at the end with Cat Steven's 'Father and Son' playing got me right in the feels. ,69by9z
dh62gb9,"""I'm Mary Poppins Y'all!"" That line cracked me up for good. Couldn't stop laughing for two whole minutes!",69by9z
dh5ppt8,The part where Drax is missing his family and Mantis touches his shoulder and starts sobbing was so perfect in my opinion. Shows there's a lot of depth to his character.,69by9z
dh5e30o,"It was cool to see Michael Rooker and Sylvester Stallone sharing the screen again, but I was hoping they'd throw in a Cliffhanger reference.",69by9z
dh5wrjv,"Man, the ending was so damn emotional, and not just in Yondu's death. I was able to make it through that. The Ravagers sending him off is what broke me. 

",69by9z
dh5s9j8,"Really glad the ""who's my daddy?"" Reveal was the opening scene since everyone basically knew. 
I enjoyed the first a little more, but this movie was great fun.
Drax's laugh should make even the most hard hearted puppy-hater happy. If it doesn't, then you're obviously a bad person. 
And shit.... I need to get on this ""Zune"" thing... I appear to be behind the times 
",69by9z
dh5x1r8,Underrated scene: The very brief shot near the end of Rocket and Peter flying through the sky together laughing and having a great time. I absolutely adored that scene. ,69by9z
dh833yi,"You know what made me really happy? They actually went and gave the planet a face. I thought even that would've been too ridiculous to do, but the madmen did it.",69by9z
dh5sazn,"yondu was a badass throughout.

his character was fleshed out extremely well, and lets face it. taking out that mutiny was just plain awesome.

edit: a word.",69by9z
dh627c7,I loved me another Howard the Duck cameo.,69by9z
dh5s8pl,"That scene with Groot taking all the items back to Yondu was amazing.

The payoff with the Toe was brilliant.",69by9z

dh9f14y,I didn't expect Star Lord to actually ask everyone for tape. That was great,69by9z
dh5f70h,"Was that fucking Jeff Goldblum as Grandmaster dancing in the credits, or was I going insane",69by9z
dh5ea06,This is the best Stan Lee scene of all time. Period,69by9z
dh5o3fk,The intro with Mr. Blue Sky playing as Baby Groot danced amidst the chaos is probably my favorite Marvel opening ever.,69by9z
dh5e107,I feel like Chris Pratt didn't do anything for the entire movie until the last 10 minutes,69by9z
dh5e6xp,Was Hela one of the ravagers or was it someone who looked just like her?,69by9z
dh5kxga,And we need this guy's eye. ,69by9z
dh6o1xv,"The funniest joke to me in the movie didn't even get a reaction in my theater. 

The camera wasn't focused on them.

Gamora: why did you pack so much stuff

Drax: I don't want groot touching my stuff 


I was laughing so hard in a quiet theater ",69by9z
dh6xedb,"How on Earth is that there there have been two films, and still, not one person has been Batista bombed?",69by9z
dh5ousq,"The Yondu scene helped me come to terms with my best friends dad taking me under his wing. He passed away in a car accident 2 years ago. This man always introduced​ me as his son. On his 56th birthday. I asked him if I could call him dad. His response was ""you've always been my son"" it was at that point I realized he actually gave a shit about me. So when Starlord had that realization. I had hard time not having a breakdown. Sitting next to my partner and unborn child I was a sad mess. It also made me happy. I felt  nothing but gratitude for the time I had with him. 

Also the scene with baby Groot climbing on Starlord leg and asking him for a headphone. I legit welled up. I felt sad and happy because I will get to experience this with my daughter at some point. That made me happy. But the thought that my dad won't be able meet her made me sad. At the same time. It's because of him I get the chance to show my daughter what a father should be. 

This movie just made me feel. I loved it as much as the first. Regardless of the hard  criticisms from people who don't like it. It really is a movie that will make you feel something. And in the end it's just a movie a lot of people worked really hard on it and it really shows. 

Anyways. Sorry for my ramblings and bad grammar. I'm an artist not a poet.",69by9z
dh612l5,When Starlord Max Payne'd Ego after mentioning the tumor.. Awesome.,69by9z
dhqo3so,"I don't think I saw anyone mention this.

My favourite scene was where Drax is stone faced talking about his wife and daughter. Then when Mantis touches him she's so overwhelmed by grief she can barely move, and Drax is still there. Just holding it down. With all that underneath. That killed me.",69by9z
dh5rpne,Yondu's character arc is absolute perfection. The movie me fall in love with the chapter to a point where my heart shattered at the end.,69by9z
dh6xa8w,"""Smaller, dumber Groot""

Drax is so amazing in this. ",69by9z
dh5emyw,"I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!!!",69by9z
dh5fau0,"Really really loved it. Great visuals, good music and great jokes

I laughed my asss off and got hit hard in some the emotional scenes



At first I was worried that they would overuse the baby groot but now I'd watch a whole movie off him doing cute shit.

Really glad they redeemed Nebula. And I really like Kraglin too.",69by9z
dh5e7oc,"I ended up actually enjoying Baby Groot a lot. Drax was also pretty great. Really everyone was fantastic but I felt like Peter was the weakest up until he started unloading on his dad. Mantis was pretty adorable.

The colors throughout were great. 

The Stan Lee Watcher scene was fantastic and if this ended up being his final cameo I'd actually be okay with it.

Honestly I'm really looking forward to see how the teams changed in Infinity War since this was supposed to be 2014-ish. ",69by9z
dh9erxs,"So, to get this straight. Ego visits other planets to spread his progeny, has Yondu kidnap his children to use as power sources, kills them when he realizes that they don't have the celestial gene, and then collects their skulls in a cave?

That's fucking metal.",69by9z
dh61g00,"Anyone else notice Goldbloom's character from Thor 3 in the credits?
  
I think he must have been in a deleted scene.",69by9z
dh7oiyc,"I lost it when they introduced the Zune as ""what everyone on earth is listening to"" ... ""It has 300 songs?!!""",69by9z
dh8tmgw,"I'M MARY POPPINS Y'ALL!

Tears evrytim",69by9z
dh9cqxg,"Shout out to Michael Rooker and his portrayal of Yondu. He can play great 'heavys' but him like Michael Madsen can project this convincing warmth showing a sensitive side while still being a badass.  
  
Probably one of the best arcs in the MCU, I was bawling when Yondu acknowledged he loved Quill like a son",69by9z
dh5mnxg,"Great movie, loved it ... but Ego knew how much Peter loved his mother and still was not inteligent enough to not tell him the story how he planted the tumor inside her brain. That was a pretty stupid move on his part.",69by9z
dh5e2h9,"I was a little concerned about all the marketing with baby Groot and how he was going to be in the movie, but OH MY GOD!!! if he wasn't the cutest thing I've ever seen! I absolutely loved him! I was sold within the first few moments when he was dancing while all action was going on behind him. 

",69by9z
dh5ep6t,"Never in my life would I have thought that I would relate on an emotional level with a talking raccoon and a walking twig

Brilliant movie ",69by9z
dh5fl1v,"Holy shit am I sad that Yondu was killed. I was really looking forward to seeing him in future GotG movies and possibly Avengers: Infinity War. He finally got a moment to shine and become a member of the Guardians, and now he's gone...

The movie as a whole though, I loved it. IMO it was a little better than the first, and felt a lot more personal than the 1st movie. Solid movie all around, probably gonna end up seeing it a few more times. ",69by9z
dh5ye9m,"Anyone else notice Drax tap his foot when it panned to him while ""Father and Son"" was playing? 

I hope it was a reference to his earlier comment about his wife. Deep (deep) down Drax is a dancer.",69by9z
dh5z5w4,I know it was a minor thing but I loved how Baby Groot would just beat on Drax every opportunity he could get ,69by9z
dh7sjyz,Was I the only one that lost their shit when he got a Zune at the end? I was the only one in the theatre laughing. ,69by9z
dh5ecd7,"Lol at Peter thinking about what he's gonna make on Ego. ""I'm gonna make some weird shit.""

My favorite Marvel movie yet. To me this encompasses all of the fun without losing any emotional punch. The funeral at the end really fucked me up. Full of cute and funny moments and a fucking dope soundtrack. Can't wait to see it again. ",69by9z
dh5fkpz,"The part where Groot keeps coming back with things and then brings a toe back had the group I went with laughing out asses off.  Just the dead silence when he shows up was great.

Also, I loved the Gamora/Nebula scenes.  If you like Gamora her new comic run is really good so far.",69by9z
dh5n6w0,Did anyone see Jeff Goldblum dancing near the end of the credits?,69by9z
dh5rnya,I never realised how OP Yondu's flying arrow was until I watched this movie.,69by9z
dh6kj4r,"best line ""I'm Marry Poppins Y'all""
seriously enjoyed the character Yondu in these movies!",69by9z
dh6t8v0,Anyone else think one or two of the Avengers would show up for a quick cameo as soon as Ego's plant started attacking earth? I figured someone would come by and try to help save the people (and the delicious blizzards in the Dairy Queen).,69by9z
dh7hjqd,[deleted],69by9z
dh5ek82,The opening sequence with Baby Groot dancing was fantastic,69by9z
dh5tgg8,"How many people are going to keep posting analyses based on the faulty concept that the Sovereign were the main antagonists?  It's very clearly Ego, in no uncertain terms.  

The Sovereign are no more the main villains of this film than the Collector was from the first film.",69by9z
dh5v4y4,Your name is Taserface? *queue hilarious laughter ,69by9z
dh5w9df,"Although it's not a perfect movie, it does so much for the characters. Almost everyone. It's not as coherent as the first one nor more exciting. But it is emotionally driven which​ is extremely fulfilling and surprising to watch.",69by9z
dh6uss6,Yondu is a cooler dad than David Hasselhoff. ,69by9z
dhfz5cz,The visual comedy with the space jumping 700 times scene totally caught me off guard. I was giggling for a good minute afterwards.,69by9z
dh5fnw1,"I might be in the minority, but I enjoyed it more than the first. ",69by9z
dh8mdr9,"Kurt Russel plays Ego.  
Ego has the power to shape itself into whatever it wants.  
Ego considers itself superior to all other life in the universe.  
Ego wishes to eradicate all other life and replace it with himself.  
Kind of like a smarter, less nightmare-fuel version of the Thing.  
Kurt Russel plays the Thing.",69by9z
dh9colt,Yondu's arrow is OP. Needs a nerf in the next patch.,69by9z
dh5qf2c,"*Mantis, look out!*",69by9z
dh5upeb,Credit scene with teenage groot is the shit,69by9z
dh5mel2,"the goddamn original guardians were in this, I lost my shit when I realized what was going on. 

Stallone was Starhawk, right along side Martinex, Charlie-27, Krugarr and Mainframe. Plus, the fact that they were all on a team with Yondu (as ravagers) makes so much sense within the context of the film. 

PLUS THEYRE GONNA BE IN FUTURE MOVIES AS A TEAM. 

I lost my shit, but I was the only one in the theatre making noise over that. 

oh, and ADAM FUCKING WARLOCK CONFIRMED. ",69by9z
dh5qb8w,"Enjoyed this one. Groot and Drax were really funny, Yondu was really good too. My only niggle which i'm suprised by is that peter quill seemed a bit...off. Dunno how to explain it but his character didn't quite seem the same character from the first movie. Maybe it was the acting i didn't like so much. Other than that though very good film ",69by9z
dh5utw2,"I think my biggest gripe is that we're expected to believe that Ego planted a freaky glowing plant in the woods about 40 feet behind a Dairy Queen, and 34 years later it's still there, completely untouched. ",69by9z
dh72fti,"Haven't seen much mention of this but the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. I'm glad Marvel is addressing the ""bland cinematography"" aspect of their films and making the movies more colorful.",69by9z
dh8nxd2,"I loved this movie. 

I loved the connections it closed to the first one and character development. 

The over arching theme of family, more to the point parental dynamics is fantastic. 

In the beginning we start with Baby Groot and everyone essentially having to parent him during a battle. When he tries to eat a bug Rocket stops him as this is something that can be dangerous. At the same time we have their understanding that he is still capable of withstanding some damage as he fights those rat-lizard aliens. 

Drax understand parental relationships, like another commenter added, he saw that Yondu was Peter's father when the others failed to do the same. There is the implication that the blood ties are the basis for the family alone when in reality the movie carries over the theme that family is not blood determined, though it can be. 

As a father Drax understands the parental bond he lost in the previous movie. We see this is something he deeply misses and mourns with his interactions with Mantis at the lake. At the end we have him somewhat recoup it as he lets baby Groot sleep on him, though he clearly isn't meant to be Groot's surrogate father. It's just an extension of the ""they're family"" thing. 

Then we have Nebula and Gamora. They are played as nemeses until they have to go against their own feelings for each other. Nebula wanted a sister but couldn't have that under their father, Thanos, as one could imagine. Gamora acknowledged she failed to have a traditional bond with her but that she felt an emotional connection with her even with the horrible way they grew up. 

The whole Yondu is Peter's parent vs Ego as the biological father thing is clear enough. What I did love though is the symbolism and mirroring that Yondu and Peter's Mother played. Meredith loved Peter - dying caused him to be damaged, as is understandable, but the issue in the last movie was Peter's inability to overcome that. He was unable to reach for his dying mother and open her final gift to him despite years.

By contrast, Yondu embraces Peter to save him and reaches to him, cupping his face, while Peter tries to save him. He reaches out to him.  When the loyal Ravengor gives Peter the last gift Yondu had for him he was able to listen to the Zune immediately. He shares the joy he is able to find from the legacy his parents gave him (music in a sense) with baby Groot. If Ego corrupted part of the fondness that Peter held for music, in particular the one his mother shared with him it by also identifying with it, Yondu remedies it by providing more music to broaden his experiences - which he did as a parent albeit a space ravenging criminal. 

TLDR: The movie is a lot of daddy issues. 
",69by9z
dhlh9ch,"Remember how everyone predicted this would end with Ego giving Star-Lord Awesome Mix Vol. 3? 

Turns out we were half-right. Peter did get more music from his ~~father~~daddy: Yondu.",69by9z
di05r1w,"I actually felt it was a bit too ""loony tunes"" for me. The first one was so unexpectedly funny but this one felt like they were trying too hard to be really zany. Rocket blowing up the ravengers as they fly off into the sky and then drop again 4 times, eyes getting bigger and faces distorted when they made their 400 jumps, just things like that kept taking me out",69by9z
dh5sjtq,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Why the Metacritic score is so low I don't understand. It was a bit over the top in terms of humour perhaps. Some of it felt out of place. Then again, they were fighting a planet...",69by9z

Also props to the production designers for Ego's planet. Really looks out of this world.

dhak3yc,"The general consensus seems to be that Vol.2 was good but not as good as Vol.1, but I really feel the opposite is true. For me, Vol.2 was the superior film.  

Vol.1 had to deal with a lot of exposition and I felt like it skimped pretty heavily on character development. Gamora and Nebula's plotline was glossed over completely in the first film, Drax and Rocket were great characters, but they lacked emotional depth.

I thought it was the perfect sequel. Gave us twice of everything we pretty much expected (the humor & the action), but also surprised us with how character-centric and emotional the story was.
I left the theater in love with the characters, and wanting more. The way Gunn flashes their weaknesses, for example by shattering Rocket's veil of cynicism or letting us see through Nebula's madness (she just wanted a sister)  is remarkable and it really made them all very lovable and relatable.

dh6go00,"Vol. 2 is the slow song to Vol 1's breakaway pop hit. 

A lot of people calling for a shorter running time. I agree regarding the Sovereign, who had one too many scenes for how disconnected they ultimately were. But overall, the movie actually needed more connective tissue. 

Ego was fun and uber hateable, but I never once felt Peter considered choosing him over the Guardians. Primarily because Ego doesn’t develop a relationship with the rest of the team, he’s completely focused on Peter. It makes sense for his character, but structurally it doesn't serve the entire cast. Avengers 1, Loki had dirt on everybody. That was accomplished through a shortcut (""Hawkeye told me"") and plain ole ""I researched everybody before the movie started"". But we forgive it because it allows him a relationship with every Avenger, makes their showdown with him individually satisfying. But Ego's solely focused on Starlord. Every scene, he's saying ""choose me”, but not saying ""don't choose them, they're flawed, here's why,” which would’ve best set up Peter choosing the Guardians’ flaws over Ego’s perfection.

Civil War gave everyone the spotlight while staying centered on the lead, which Vol 2 doesn't quite manage. But I do really like how much Peter goes into the background and Vol 2 belongs to everyone. How many roles afford as much dimension as Yondu did for Michael Rooker? Nebula and Gamora's relationship was so painful and necessary. New layers to Rocket as well, overcoming self-sabotage. Vol 2 has an embarrassment of riches; it gets drunk and forgets to spend them all, but it's still a great time.",69by9z

dh783tt,"Haven't seen anyone discuss this yet so I'd thought I'd share my thoughts:

Selfishness/pride was a big theme and that's why the main villain is literally called Ego, whose motivation is more of himself. That's why even before revealing him there are so many little scenes of the Guardians fighting, arguing, and making stupid decisions (Rocket & Quill fighting over piloting the ship, Drax thinking he can solo the monster from the inside, Rocket stealing the batteries, etc). And the only way to keep this cancerous ego from spreading is an ultimate act of selflessness - the sacrifice of Yondu. 

I know I guess overall it's a pretty simple theme, but I think it was a necessary external and internal battle for the characters so that they become more developed and cohesive. I think it's pretty typical in trilogies that part 2 focuses more on character development than overall plot. 

Either way, I enjoyed the hell out of this movie",69by9z

In general this one did what a good sequel should do which is to actually add more context and texture to the 1st movie if you go back and watch it again.

dh5e0r7,"[Vol. 2](https://tldrmoviereviews.com/2017/04/25/movie-review-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2/) really connected with me because its big theme was all about family. Sure Vol 1 touched on this, but that was more about becoming a family, Vol. 2 is about having to live as a family. Dealing with the deadbeat dad that is now popping back in your life because you’re famous, or the estranged sister in law, or the weird uncle that builds bombs out of spare parts, or the teenager that lets his vines grow all over the place.

I don’t think I have ever had such a pure hate for a character when Ego mentioned that he gave Peter’s mum cancer, since those guys that killed John Wick’s dog, but wow, so glad to see him get wrecked.

This movie ended on the line ""Now there's a way and I have to go away, I know I have to go"" from Cat Steven's ""Father and Son"" as it zoomed in on Rocket's teary eyed face.

Rocket continues to struggle with who and what he is. He repeatedly, angrily, rejects being called a raccoon, a rat, a trash panda, a monkey, a dog, among others. He doesn't know what he is, or he doesn't accept it.

He finally formed a bond with Yondu when Yondu told Rocket they were the same and that's partly why Yondu's death bothered him so much.

Another interesting thing is when the Ravengers showed up for Yondu's space funeral, Rocket mumbled to himself how Yondu wasn't able to push the Ravengers away, even in exile.

I could be wrong, but it seems to me that Rocket is having a bit of an identity crisis and connects a lot with Yondu's character, in terms of being the outcast.

dhjv22i,"I really enjoyed this film. Saw it in 3D, would gladly have paid double for my ticket, it was fab. The Drax Comedy Show was side splitting. The ravagers and everything that happened close to them was really good; both hilarious and also featuring some of the best character development in the MCU. Gomorrah's emotional arc was enjoyable and the action was very satisfying, a real step up from the first one. Baby Groot was a gift we didn't deserve.

*However*, the movie was not without flaws. There were more than a handful of occasions where the CGI looked like it was from a video game (think the skeletons being formed from sand), and there were a few plot moments that were just utterly contrived. The abuse of Mantis was just a little bit on the wrong side of too far to be lighthearted. Having Peter be mind controlled rather than making a decision and having to undergo a moment of internal emotional reasoning to overcome his father's influence was a shame, it could have been a fabulous show of character. Gomorrah and Nebula's moment was rushed into and rushed out of, even though it was really fun to watch.

Ultimately though, I thought it was a really good movie. I had a lot of fun, the characters changed and the world was expanded (first mention of Celestials, amirite?), it did a great many things right. I have high hopes for the next one and I hope some if these flaws either get fixed or don't have the opportunity to arise. Well worth the ticket price, and the DVD too.",69by9z

See, my mother is my biological mother, and my father is not.  When I was 16 or so, it was revealed to me that my father is actually my step father, and no one knows where my biological father went to.  There are all different stories, but all I ever got was his name.  So watching this movie, and the final interactions between Yondu and Peter really hit home.  Peter always wondered who he was and I have been trying to do the same.  For years I wondered why my last name was different on some old kindergarten projects.  Why I didn't have any real home videos with a father figure in them.  Why my parents never openly talked about my heritage for my elementary school projects.  All of this hit me in a matter of seconds.

There are continuity issues with this setting and the impact of some of the film on what that meant for other films in the Marvel Universe.

Drax's character seemed to have a personality change from the last one despite them basically being set back to back. The story was just non-existent, blindingly obvious and just a little boring really. Everyone had issues. Seriously, everyone. It was simply a massive therapy session for them all and that's about it, with LOTS OF SHOUTING BECAUSE OF SHOOTING AND HITTING EACH OTHER. Then there's the unnecessary cameos that I simply do not understand why they were there. Everything about this felt like a cheap second rate franchise film (thinking Ocean's 12 here).

That said, it's fun and there are some good jokes among the obvious (although baby Groot is overdone for me). It's also beautiful to look at and sets it up so they've now passed their 'issues' phase.

I think what was best about this second movie is that it improved on the characters. It didn’t try to change them, it expanded on who they were and reminded us what makes them great heroes. Not to mention the casting was great. Kurt Russell was amazing and hilarious. Pom Klementieff did a wonderful job as Mantis and she was probably my favorite new character. The jokes as just as good as they were in the first movie, the soundtrack is still awesome and all around, it’s my favorite movie of 2017 so far.

There wasn't exactly a massive plot and in the grand scheme of the Marvel universe it didn't really illuminate anything new. There also wasn't really a ""big bad"" to fight against in the end (Ego was obviously the enemy, but really only in the final act of the film), which I actually thought was a refreshing change.

Overall, I liked the first movie more, but I still really enjoyed this one! It was much better than a lot of the movies I've seen, recently.

Yondu I thought brought great emotional depth, but then you had the subtle emotional moments like with Mantis and Drax. The first one I felt only had the Rocket scene.

- Yondu losing his ravager family and focusing on his surrogate son instead
- drax making a genuine friend
- Gamora coming to terms with her sister
- Nebula (holy shit) doing the same and having a pivotal role
- Quill finding out who his real dad was, in more ways than one
- Ego rejecting love and family in favor of himself and immortality, and quill doing the opposite

dha8cbs,"My wife picked up on the theme of the movie, namely the dangers of ego (little E).  Virtually every character in the film was concerned about how they were regarded and this drove many of the character arcs throughout the film.

(""ego"" here being ""a person's sense of self-esteem or self-importance"" rather than the Freudian version)

Spoilers abound:

(big E) Ego found life, but found it wanting, as it wasn't up to his standards.  He sought to overwrite everything to be as he is, as no other life measured up.  He had little care for any other life, and that life that came closest (Mama Quill) he killed, as she was tempting him away from himself.

Star-Lord's self-worth was constantly challenged as a child as he had no father figure, and thus created the Hasselhoff imaginary figure.  Having a real father blinded him to possible dangers presented by Gamora.

Nebula sought victory over Gamora to prove her worth.  She had no other reason beyond just being better and beating her, as this was the measuring stick of her self-worth.

Mantis existed without social interaction beyond Ego (she outright admits to being a flea with purpose) and is basically a blank slate.

Rocket possessed numerous insecurities because of his heritage and stature and proved to be his great weakness.  This is, however, something he understood, and weaponized this against Taserface (snicker).  

Yondu sought the respect of his peers but was shunned for his misdeeds.  

Many of the characters' arcs completed with these failings rectified:

Yondu's actions in regards to Quill proved to be for the greater good, as he deprived Ego of what he sought and raised the boy to be strong in the world he was brought into.  Quill realized he had a father.  Yondu was posthumously recognized by his peers.

Rocket found a friend (outside Groot) and someone to connect with in Yondu.

Mantis established a relationship with Drax, who acknowledged her inner, if not outer, beauty.

Nebula sought the acknowledgement of her father, but found it instead with her sister.

Quill found his father figure.  By extension, the entire first movie was him trying to make his mark on the galaxy, so when he's addressed as Star-lord, he knows he's made it.

",69by9z

If he was intelligent enough to build a perfectly functioning human avatar (complete with penis) and understood enough about human emotion to be scared of love messing up his plans, he should have surely realized that Peter was going to flip the fuck out.

Also, why would he leave the remains of his half-Celestial children lying around to be found? He could have just vaporized them or crafted them into something else. He's essentially a God on that planet. Felt contrived to me.

Although it wasn't as fresh as the first one it retained the same comedic elements that made the first one such a joy to watch, although some of it was forced it still left a pleasant taste when I left the theatre. Action was decent - end sequence and battle was slightly choppy but the fight at the start was good. I really loved the ending - Yondu's death was beautifully done and I admit that I shed a few tears during the film - Yondu really grew on me throughout the film. His funeral and then the other Ravagers returning to honour him was incredibly well done. 

Favourite scene of the film would have to be the one when Yondu and Racoon kill everyone on board the ship of the mutineers. With the sequence, the music and the vengeance aspect it had, with his whole crew dying, it was a really satisfying and badass scene watch. Racoon laughing in the face of death with his repeated 'Taseface' was great as well.

I think it was fun. It was visually super vibrant, had a lot of really great action and a hell of a lot of jokes. I found most the jokes hit for me, plus the addition of baby groot was really silly and enjoyable, especially that opening scene, which just had me beaming from ear to ear all the way through.

I do feel like the plot didn't move loads, we didn't go far from the beginning of the film to the end, but I do think the short journey was packed with loads of emotion and character development, even Drax got more backstory alongside his newfound love of one liners. Yondu definitely stood out as a highlight for me, his emotional development was extremely satisfying and watching him redevelop a relationship with Peter was really sweet

I feel like there are some open questions and slight plotholes that the film didn't answer, but people in this thread have collated them well. They didn't really hinder my enjoyment at all

Overall I'd say 8/10, I was grinning through most the film!

dha2lun,"I felt like the way the movie was structured created a double edged sword with the villain. On the one hand it was great to have so much time to get to know Ego so that he's fleshed out in service of the surprise turn for his character. But on the other it feels like the movie is missing a villain for so much of the story that the movie seems to meander without a purpose for a long time. It made the whole second act feel odd and purposeless, and underscored how not compelling the gold people were as a slapstick set of villains. 

Compare it to Empire Strikes Back (possibly an unfair comparison, I know), which follows a similar structure insofar as in the second act a set of characters arrive at a seemingly friendly planet where something is wrong and ultimately it results in doom in the third act climax. In Empire it was clear almost right away that something is amiss because 3PO goes missing, and Leia picks up on it right away. In Guardians 2, nothing feels all that wrong before Gamora starts asking serious questions about the planet. Sure, Mantis has that moment where she doesn't say something, but overall the stakes seem relatively low until they are not. The jump from ""everything is fine"" to ""Ego is a fucking crazy bastard"" is so sudden, there's no build up. We don't have a villain/threat for that entire time because who cares about the gold people, as compared to Empire where Vader is out there the entire time, hiring bounty hunters and tearing up asteroid fields.

All in all Guardians 2 was fun but nowhere near the level of the original, and in large part that felt like a symptom of the script being too focused on the surprise turn with Ego, and in the process leaving the audience without a clear sense of stakes/threat for a huge chunk of the movie.",69by9z

The first movie had a great list of callback rock songs, but it sorta felt like it was just a random compilation. In this one most of the songs resonated with the scenes they appeared in.

For example: ""My Sweet Lord"" playing during the scene where they explore around Ego's utopia.

The insight to Rocket that we got was really good too, and also thought Nebula had a really great moment when it came to fleshing her out with Gamora, even if the ship chase might've been a little dumb leading up to it. Kurt Russell as Ego was okay, but at this point with the MCU movies it feels like every other thing is an excuse for a catastrophic event, and I didn't totally buy into his villain reveal either. It just didn't fully resonate for me when it came to motivations, and I know that's a comic book movie thing usually. Some sort of sympathy or added depth to Ego would've been more interesting. I feel there was a genuine opportunity with his character between being a Celestial planet and having Peter for a son that had more potential than what we got when it came to conflict.](#spoiler)

Overall it's probably the funniest Marvel Studios film but I feel like it's because it tried *so hard* to be that. Not all of the humor really worked (but when it hits, it hits hard) and it felt forced at times with sort of predictable beats on top of it. I didn't really like Drax in this movie all that much after loving him in the original. He gets no real action (the action is much more space battle and less skill/choreography stuff too, which is a shame because some cool team stuff like we saw in the first or in Avengers movies would've been great) and the basis of Drax's humor just feels kind of off for me. I think it worked a lot better in Vol. 1 because his base personality was calm and serious, but in this movie he's hysterically laughing about *everything* and it just didn't feel organic and almost too self-aware as an effort to do something because it would make the audience laugh instead of a natural occurrence for his character that incidentally or ironically results in a joke.

The way the story plays out is also a little messy. [The Sovereign are such a non-factor that their post-credit scene must come off like a joke to anyone that's not familiar with Adam Warlock/comics](#spoiler). It feels almost sudden when it's time for the climax to start. Not to say I didn't enjoy it, I did, but the sense of direction in the narrative felt a little meandering. I think people often complain about the Marvel movies being too funny but I personally have been of the opinion that they strike a pretty good balance most of the time for the overall tone of the universe on a movie-by-movie basis. This was actually the first time that I was watching an MCU movie where I felt like it was going way too strong for levity, to a point where I was consciously worrying during certain genuinely dramatic moments because I *didn't* want there to be a joke to try and take the edge off the audience.

7/10. I liked it and would watch it again, had a lot of fun watching, but just analyzing the movie I think it could've been better. Mantis was a good addition, Quill and Gamora are good as usual, but I think it might be a mistake if they pull the trigger on a romance between the two in the future.",69by9z

I think it's just as funny as the first one but this felt like there were more forced humor, like some higher-ups at Marvel demanded they add in more jokes. I thought Drax's humor in the first worked because he was just awkward and unintentionally funny, it felt like he was a joke character in this movie.

My only complaint is that the jokes felt a bit more one-note and low-brow than the first.

So we assume his powers come from that brain thing. I mean thats where his dads powers come from. But yet his dad uses him a a battery draining his power to fuel his growth.

This series knows its place and doesn't take itself too seriously, which is a welcome change regarding Marvel/super hero movies.

Edit: Also, these after credit scenes are getting absurd. Just extend the movie a bit more if you must include 4 different scenes. I don't mind 1 after credit scene, but don't get too cute with it

_Translation: Overall it was a fantastic experience.

Some of the backgrounds even resemble matte backgrounds from 80s films. The jokes come a mile a minute (I laughed so hard I couldn't breathe at the Taserface bit and at Rocket's distorted face during the hyperspace jump) but they never compromise the earnest emotional parts of the movie. And Ego goes from ""aww, Dad"" to ""you bastard!"" in like a fucking SECOND, and from that moment on all you want is to see him get rekt.

dhoqwcu,"There are so many good ideas in this movie, but a lot of them were executed poorly. The reveal of Ego being bad felt hamfisted (like oh ya btw son I killed your mom OMG HES A BAD GUY NOW OK), the comedy was very hit or miss. By that I mean they were overboard with the jokes to the point where 50% of them felt boring. I'm sorry but that part where Star lord is going around asking for tape had me poker faced the entire time. It's a very mediocre joke that was already spoiled to us by the trailers, which was a god awful marketing decision. 

Also I hate how EVERY character had to have a teary eyed revelation moment with cutesy music suddenly playing. It's like they did that for one character, but then felt if they didn't do it for all the other characters they wouldn't feel important. Ya, just typical hollywood bullshit. 

What WAS great though was the relationship between the characters. We knew from the past one that Peter and Rocket sort of got on each others' nerves, so it makes sense that over the time they become even more hostile towards each other. I also like they're all used to Drax's shenanigans, and how whenever he does something dumb they're just like ""eh.... ok"". Also I loved how they explored [YOndu's character, and showed us some tidbits from his past. It made him feel like a fully fleshed out character.

it wasn't as much of a surprise as the first one, and maybe some of the dialogue didn't feel as organic, but it most definitely kept up the Guardians vibe from the first film in terms of heart, humour, action and visuals...

musically it maybe didn't have as many perfect moments as the first film...Guardians 1 was actually really really accomplished at that...looking back i now think that was one of the best chosen soundtracks i've ever heard

i was particularly pleased with how this film moved forward the relationships between the original Guardians, while also successfully expanding the Guardians team

dh84qka,"I must say, I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. I was *very worried* that they would just try to rehash a lot of the humor from the first movie. Although there were moments that had a very similar tone, I think Gunn did a good job of giving this one a unique feel. Also, I avoided the trailers (for the most part), so I didn't have ""many of the jokes were spoiled"" syndrome going into it.

I decided not to tag the spoilers because I'm assuming that 99% of people on this thread have already seen it. However, if you haven't seen it and don't want spoilers, beware! 

Just a few thoughts:

1) I loved how Yondu's character was developed. I genuinely hated him in the first one (not just because he was a ""villain,"" but because I honestly thought he was a creep and pretty annoying). But, the moment he started bonding with Rocket *and* his revelation to Quill that he always thought he was his true father was heartbreaking. Was it a little predictable? Yes. Does that take out the emotional punch from those scenes? Not at all.

2) On that same note, the scene where Yondu, Rocket and Groot take over the Ravager ship was, in my opinion, the best scene of the movie. I thought the visuals were fantastic and, like so many other songs in this franchise, ""Come A Little Bit Closer"" was the last song I would've guessed for this scene, and yet, now I cannot imagine that scene without it. It was just so spot-on.

3) I thought Drax's outbursts of laughter would get annoying, but they surprisingly didn't. I really enjoyed the relationship between him and Mantis. I thought it was hilarious when he'd say things to her that he thought were nice, when in reality, they were just backhanded compliments. The whole part about how ugly people don't have to deal with as much fakeness as attractive people was great. Oh, and the sensitive nipples. Now we know why he doesn't wear shirts (and it reminded me a lot of Randy Bo-Bandy from Trailer Park Boys!). 

4) Like Yondu, I think Nebula really shined in this one. I think the sign of a truly great director is when you can make your villains sympathetic. Even though she ends up as a ""good guy"" by the end of the film, I think the viewer really starts feeling for her and proved the old saying of how, ""the villain always believes in their heart that they are the hero."" I'm really looking forward to seeing more of her in the upcoming MCU movies. I think I read that she's going to be in Infinity War. I don't know if Loki will, however--which is a shame, because it would be really cool to see the Nebula/Gamora *and* Loki/Thor sibling rivalries play out simultaneously. 

5) Besides the scene with Yondu's Yaka Arrow, I also loved when Mantis touches Drax and immediately bursts into tears. That one, simple moment did so much to convey the immense pain that Drax lives in. I think it was interesting how Gunn chose to do this through a different character altogether experiencing his suffering. This is a wonderful example of ""show me, don't tell me,"" filmmaking. We were told in Vol. 1 how sad he is, but Vol. 2 truly showed us.

6) The opening scene was fantastic. What a great curveball Gunn threw at us. It took a lot balls for him to convince the studio to let him film what was probably an expensive scene only to have it play out in the background. 

Anyway, did I think this movie was perfect? No. Did I think it was ""better"" than Vol. 1? In some ways, no. In other ways, yes (I think it was more emotional). But, it was just about as good of a sequel as we could've asked for. ",69by9z

The Galaxy felt a lot smaller this time around, with most of the action centered around a couple planets (mostly Ego's World), so it felt less like a journey with many stops (a la Volume 1). This was a slight negative, but the CG for the planets was really pretty, so it's a bit of a wash for me.

Wasn't a huge fan of the way the Nebula/Gamora plot played out, but having Nebula turn to the 'good side' doesn't​ make sense for her character, so it makes sense. Just wished they had gotten more time to explore the conflict rather than a few brief scenes. 

There were some great jokes in this film, and perhaps they went to the same well a few too many times, but it was good to have tension releases (like Mantis getting hit and Drax shouting ""look out!"" afterwards). I think the only movie I laughed out loud more at was Deadpool. The Mary Poppins line is one of the best in this film.

Wasn't a huge fan of Groot being incompetent, but it's cute and it sells merchandise, and it ultimately wasn't terribly consequential, so it gets a pass. I did like the teenage Groot post-credits scene, though. 

Really liked the soundtrack, and I think Gunn & Co. hit it out of the park again with their music selections. They didn't try to copy the same music as the first one, so the soundtrack is unique, but they picked songs that were meaningful to the scenes they were played in and that fit the same broad style as the previous film. Special praise goes to their use of Fleetwood Mac's ""The Chain""; I can picture the scene it's used in listening to it, and the lyrics and tone perfectly​ fit the scenario. 

I also liked that characters died and death was a part of the film. It's always rewarding to know that actions have consequences, and what Yondu did carries more weight knowing that his sacrifice was real. This is the kind of series that I can see having main characters die in meaningful ways and make it work. It always irks me when perilous situations in film become meaningless because I know that the main character™ will live no matter what. 

I think having the ""heroes"" of the story face multiple fronts of conflict at the same time adds believability, especially in a universe that has such diverse life. With so many varying perspectives and cultures, there is no clear-cut ""good side"" and ""bad side""; there are many sides with different goals, and I think the movie portrayed that well.

Wow, this is way longer than I intended, and if you made it this far, congratulations! Tl, dr: Overall, I liked it. Effects, makeup and music were outstanding, writing/comedy was pretty good and I enjoyed the weight that the film placed on the characters' actions. ""Best Picture"" it isn't, but it's still a fun break from the stereotypical Avengers/MCU movies. 7.5/10 would get ""The Chain"" stuck in my head again",69by9z

A little *too* big- a few of the plotlines (like Nebula's *Infinity War* set-up) seemed a bit tacked on or overly drawn-out, and the music wasn't quite as good- although it still was awesome (for most movies this wouldn't be a major deal, but for *Guardians* it is). 

However, I *loved* how they have adapted some of the more outlandish parts of cosmic Marvel here. Having the original ""future"" Guardians be a previous group of criminals-for-a-good-cause is a neat way to introduce them without forcing time travel into the mix (I mean, the original GoTG is so weird and out there that I have no problem with this huge change from the comics), Ego worked way better than he probably had any right to (probably behind only Loki as far as movie villains in the MCU, and still top five overall if you include TV villains), Adam Warlock being the creation of a perfection-obsessed society of genetic engineers is a good twist on his more Earthy origin, and oh dear god the Watchers.

I liked it overall.  My new favorite intro to a movie, for sure.  Baby Groot is really goddamn adorable.  It was so light-hearted and fun, that when *that event* happens, the entire theatre just cried in awkward silence.  

I really liked how they kind of gave a shout out to Ego's [Marvel card](https://assets.catawiki.nl/assets/2011/11/26/3/a/8/3a8c60a0-fa5d-012e-b00c-0050569439b1.jpg).

The villain arc in this just wasn't as commanding?, I guess as Ronan the Accuser's was in the first one.  Menacing?  Filled with rage?  Something.  Kurt Russell's character just seemed to be missing something.

They really could have showcased Thanos in this too.  

And the whole bit about Nebula getting a warship to kill him.  Sure.  Good luck.

The humor was great, really good job, but the transition from comedic scenes to serious stuff were not well executed, I didn't buy those heartfelt moments between Yondu and Rocket or Yondu and Peter, felt too forced.

But I also felt like they just threw out so many mediciore jokes, some were great but some you could see almost a mile away.  And the visual gag at the big fight was something straight out of Pixels and totally took me out of the film.  Also Groot was basically just a Minion a lot of the time.  The title sequence with him was a great intro though.

But it's extremely enjoyable.  I saw it in IMAX 3D and I'd say it has the best 3D I've seen in a movie to date.  It didn't look like 2D cutouts moving around there was an amazing gradation of depth to the distance.  

Yondu's arrow was my favorite part.  In the first film it really wowed me and in this they just have a lot of fun with it.

I honestly wish that volume 3 was smaller scale.  Sure they've saved the galaxy twice now.  But as one credit scene shows, the ""original"" guardians have reunited.

dh9vchz,"just wanted to add how phenomenal this movie was. this was a PERFECT comics-based movie, like gotg1 and ironman1. the entire movie focuses on characters and plot, not the actors. it also focuses on teamwork, which a lot of 'team' movies don't. basically guardians of the galaxy is EVERYTHING that avengers and xmen are not- moviewise. which is funny because not alot of people have heard of these characters before the first gotg movie, and now im sure these characters are all pop culture references/icons. the movie has humor, feels, action, cgi, throwback references, easter eggs, surprises, like EVERYTHING.

anyways, good job to the studios involved, writers, actors, everyone involved for their teamwork in creating this awesome movie. props to this franchise, and please don't ruin it like ironman franchise where you make sequels that don't matter and destroy pre-established characters. also, cpt america franchise is great.",69by9z

di37c55,I feel like James Gunn saw what was great about Guardians of the Galaxy (the light hearted tone and the humor) and shot it up with steroids forgetting that character and plot were two components he really needed. The silly tone of it was so bad that [they downplayed Yondu's funeral and therefore death with way too many jokes](#spoiler),69by9z
dhry23f,"Gamora's story felt like it got pulled in two different directions between reconciliation with her sister and realisation of her relationship with Peter. When Nebula explains that every time she lost to Gamora a piece of her got ""upgraded"" was the highlight of this relationship. (even though Gamora wasn't even on the screen for this reveal) On the other front, the arm around the waist moment with Peter at the end felt right, but also felt tacked on because so much of Gamora's screen time before this was with her sister. Still nice to see no cliche end of movie kiss.

Peter (Star-Lord) didn't have nearly the same charisma for me this time around. A lot of the Ego scenes just didn't do it for me especially the fight scene at the end. The few comedy moments were still nice though. Perhaps my biggest strike against this movie is how forgettable Peter's parts were and yet he's still the majority of the movie.

Rocket gets a lot of screen time to say over and over again that he pushes the people he loves away. He also does many of the same bits from last movie. 

Groot's opening scene is great and certainly one of my favourite parts of the movie. I hope the next movie has a different character with a dance routine to start. Overall, a lot of nice moments that weren't all just Groot being cute. Probably the only bit that annoyed me was Groot trying to get the fin moment that went about 5 items too many. Also, teenage Groot was great, but I hope we never see him again.

Drax was easily the most improved character for me. I found him the least funny character in the first movie whereas I really felt like they nailed his humour in this one. Even though Mantis was largely tacked on to develop Drax it seems.... that tacking on was appreciated as for me, Drax was among my favourite parts of this movie.

Yondu didn't do it for me. A few nice moments, but I didn't get nearly enough out of his presence for the amount of screen time his storyline got. Overall, it felt like his story was choppy and rushed. The Mary Poppins moment was hilarious though.

Ultimately, it was a decent movie. Pretty much on par with Avengers: Age of Ultron for me.",69by9z

dlenoka,"Just got done with the movie.

I'm honestly not a fan of the flanderization of Drax and Groot. I get that Groot is cute and that Drax is sometimes too literal... but holy shit a majority of their screen time or dialogue was revolving those characteristics. 

I just wish all of the characters got similarly complex development rather than just the main 3. 

Coming from watching Civil War which actually had excellent character development to this... I can't say I'm too impressed. 

It basically seems like they tried to shove as many scenes as possible into this movie that made the first one popular. 

All things considered, It could've been much more than It was. I'm not impressed but I didn't feel that my time was wasted. It's hard to believe that both movies were directed by the same person...

This film was much funnier and I think we got a deeper look at the characters which was a pleasant surprise. I didn't expect that at all and quite liked what we saw. 

My only gripe with the film was that is suffered from having no goal for the first half. The film starts with them doing what they do best, then randomly while on the run they are saved (dues ex machina) by Ego (Kurt Russell was fantastic) and then these events just sort of unfold. 

I felt like it didn't build up to to what we got, and there was no goal so I had nothing to cheer for. 

8/10, the film looks and feels fantastic. It's a boat load of fun.

Yondu may have stolen the movie for me. ",69by9z
dh5kdej,"Well, honestly I'm glad the early reviews were not so hot on the movie, I went in with reasonable expectations, the first Guardians is my favorite of the MCU, and personally I had a blast with this new issue. I thought the comedy worked almost every time, the soundtrack is not as good as the first but still extremely enjoyable, the characters are simply the best, you can put them in every situation and it's gonna work. I heard a lot of complaints regarding the first hour being a mess and I couldn't disagree more, it's probably because I love the ""hangout"" type of movies when there's not necessarily the most engaging story, but the characters are so well-written you can watch them for hours, and this is the case with the Guardians of the Galaxy. I also heard complaints about the ""Gold people"" in the movie and I thought it was obvious they represented a satire of the usual blend villains, they even make them all gold so that they all look the same, they also failed everytime they tried an attack, the movie even pokes fun at it at some point. I agree that it's not as great as the first, but I think it's very close and unfair to compare it to the first.

Overall, I loved the movie, honestly I'm ready to take the heat but I like this better than Civil War or Dr. Strange being a huge fan of the Guardians, the film was just plain fun, I had more laughs then any other Marvel movies. I give it a **8.5/10** on first watch.

dh8k5hj,"Very fun. Most of the humor hit its mark and the emotional scenes were surprisingly deep considered the neon colors and jokes that came before. Has some tone and pacing problems here and there, but it had enough strong points to carry its own weight.

Rooker did a fucking phenomenal job, and Kurt Russel put in a great performance as well. I felt like some of the baby Groot moments were way too played out unfortunately.

Very interested to see how they handle Adam Warlock, and how soon we'll see him. Wouldn't be at all surprised if they hold onto him for vol 3.

And finally i'll get a little personal. When I was very young my father left my mother and i, and hasn't been seen or heard from again. Seeing how peter struggled with his father and abandonment issues really hit home and got to me, and even got a few tears. The narrative of nature vs nuture, and biological vs surrogate fathers was very well handled. I have to give Gunn HUGE props for how well he pulled it off.

Edit: also have to point out one of my favorite scenes that I havent seen mentioned. The scene where Ego explains how he and Peter are ""sailors"" from 'Brandy (you're a fine girl)'. It's a fairly mundane scene where Ego spits a bunch of crap and half truths (considering what we know later), but the composition was excellent.

Good: The characters are all still relentless charming and fun.

The world building, design work, costuming, and CGI were also top notch. Lots of fun work done with a lot of imagination and joy. I also loved the opening credits, set a great tone.

The Meh: I don't know if Ego really worked as a villain. The move slowed down from the second he arrived, and his goals and powers were both vague and cliched. Kurt tried his best, and was charming as well, but the character did not quite land.

When Ego was using Peter to fuel the light to complete his plan, he called him a **battery.** Pretty specific. So the rest of the guardians show up to help protect Peter and defeat Ego. In the end, they defeat him and get Peter back. At the start of the film, they fight a giant monster (albeit not planet sized) to protect priceless *batteries.* Afterwards it's revealed that Rocket stole some of these batteries.

Kurt Russell kills it",69by9z
dhbur3x,"I know it's hard to top the freshness of the first film, but I think this is a superior movie. The script is a lot tighter IMO. Less clunky, more subtle and concrete in its themes, and genuinely clever (not even talking about the jokes). A simple one minute conversation about the meaning of a song does so much to establish the motivations and worldview of two characters and is much more natural than having them shout their goals and beliefs from a mountain top. 

1. The central theme of family is more specific and detailed. You get organic character growth through different pairings in the movie. The first film was a bit ""tell-not-show"" and generic in its treatment of the family dynamic, even though it still worked pretty well.

2. The villain was *far* superior to Ronan, who was another in a long line of cardboard one-dimensional characters, who just shout cliched threats and don't get enough screen time for us to care about. This film went away from the typical Marvel villain plot, and it really worked. This was a character we actually got a feel for who made an impression. There was actually a connection between the good guys and the bad guys, rather than just the bad guy having a plan that the good guy just happen to become obstacles to.

3. There are still some typical Marvel movie flaws in this film, but it really does address a lot of the issues I've had with other Marvel movies of late. I've already mentioned the villain, but there are also actual stakes in this movie. Unlike many other Marvel sequels which feel disconnected from their predecessors, this movie felt very connected to the first GOTG movie. It seems like there was more forethought and planning towards the sequel in the original, and thus there were payoffs in this film that built off of character development in the last film much more organically. Yondu in particular exemplifies this.

4. Lastly, I felt that the flow was much smoother and less clunky in this film than the first one (although I understand that the first one had the difficult task of introducing the galaxy setting to the MCU). There was less exposition than in the first movie, and the exposition that was included always felt natural and in keeping with what was happening on screen -- in the first film I found myself constantly aware of characters saying things purely for the benefit of the audience, that they wouldn't actually have to explain to the other characters in the scene.",69by9z

Ant-Man was a heist film, The Winter Soldier was a spy thriller, etc. The Guardians of the Galaxy films fit in the comedy category more than they do for Action/Adventure/etc. You can disagree about the direction (see: IronMan 3) but I think it's a bit misplaced here.

dh7p5kc,"Saw it over a week ago in the UK and had typed my thoughts out already.

* **Argh my nipples!** Loved the callback
* Surprise cameos from Stallone/Hasselhoff I'm surprised they kept that under wraps.
* Not sure if it's better than the original but it's probably just as good which isn't a criticism. It's probably the most consistent sequel from Marvel and im glad they've kept Gunn to handle them.
* Didn't think Youdu would die but it was a valiant death.
* I thought the film was especially funny maybe even more so than the first film.
* Soundtrack was great no surprise.
* Drax was even better this film and his comedic timing was great.
* Both Nebula and Mantis were great additions to the film that didn't feel useless.
* Especially liked Drax and Mantis' chemistry.
* I guess the biggest downside people may mention is ~~Jeff Bridges~~ Kurt Russell as the villain. I didn't think he was bad though and for an immortal being his motivation were legit.
* Baby groot was super cute and it was sad when he started crying because he was trapped.
* There were legit 5 credits scenes including an after credits. Teenage groot was amazing lol and Peter actually understood what he way saying.
* I also loved how different parts of the credits said 'I Am Groot' before changing to the actual word
* Stan Lee cameo was legit unexpected lol
* Adam Warlock pretty much confirmed for gotg 3 I guess.
* Anyone noticed the modified Avengers theme? Pretty nice touch ",69by9z
dh8qhd0,"While watching it, I felt like Gunn had watched the Suicide Squad last year, took notes of everything that went wrong in that movie and did the opposite for this movie. Diablo's ""I am not going to lose another family"" scene as well as the general building up of the ""family"" was a joke. Rocket's ""I am not going to lose another friend,"" as well as the building up of Yondu's character as being part of the family was heartbreaking. The use of music in Suicide Squad was some of the worst usage I have ever seen in a movie, Gunn, once again, showed you how to do it right, and even improved on it in this movie. The Suicide Squad broke the cardinal rule of ""show, don't tell,"" which lead to a confusing storyline and everyone explaining every minute detail without really showing anything. ""This is Katana...."" Again, GOTG 2 did the opposite. I loved how much actual visual comedy was in this one. (Visual comedy seems to be a dying art in movies these days.) Gunn even showed you how you take a god-like creature down the right way. How to make him/her an actual threat. Was anyone scared by the god-like creature in Suicide Squad? 

I was afraid that GOTG Vol 2 wasn't going to be as good as the first one. That it was going to turn out to be like Avengers 2 with Whedon. But I loved it way more than the first. The first GOTG was a big boat of fun. This one has so much heart. Gunn really is a talented director. ",69by9z

All the serious moments felt forced and I wanted to feel for the characters at their serious moments but it didn't feel real, TBH. When Chains came on in the final battle, I was feeling a little pumped up, but then it just fell flat. I don't know, I'm not usually a huge critic ever, but I was letdown by this movie.

dh5qtfm,"Some thoughts, in no particular order:


It was definitely a film centered around the ensemble rather than Star Lord - that alone I don't dislike - but the pacing between each arc (gamora/nebula, rocket/yondu, starlord/ego) was really bad at time and didn't leave much room at all for the climax of the film to feel fulfilling.

Instead,  we got three plots, sort of jumbled together for no reason. The characters do have motivation for their plot, but their interactions felt shoehorned in to the ""central"" plot dealing with Ego. And,  a lot of that dialogue felt either poorly written or poorly acted (Nebula was very bad). 

By the end I didn't really feel much at all for any of their plot resolutions and Drax, the caricature that he was in this movie, seemed to have some of the nicest/most genuine moments with Mantis.

The music felt...less punchy? It wasn't how much it was in the film, but how many times it came up and made no impact so by the time a song came on that really fit and amplified a scene I would initially roll my eyes. 

The humor was mostly good, but again,  pacing with it was weird and I felt it could have done with just 10% less jokes. 

Action was cool, but, and this annoyed me so much,  most of the action sequences felt paced so poorly. The chief offender was the climax, where every time drama felt like it was building it would cut to the other characters doing something. 

Overall GOTG2 felt like it had a lot of cool concepts. I love the idea of Ego, but for me not to roll my eyes at how ridiculous the action was at the end I need some more plot investment.  Especially considering that horrible exposition scene where he explains his origins/goals. 

I did like the film somewhat, but it felt bloated and messy and just... less sharp than the first?",69by9z

dh7x3k3,"I enjoyed this movie.  
I laughed an awful lot but I can't say what was funniest to me. Probably 90% of Drax's lines. I did like the way the golden people (forgot what they were called) operated their ships. Someone should add coin slots to those. The carpet bit was great, too.  
I also loved the tender moments in this movie. Yondu saving Peter was so bittersweet. Finding out how Peter's mom died was terrifying. His reaction was the best.  
Kurt Russell killed it in this role. Ego is now my favorite MCU villain. He's definitely one of the best-acted. I hate that he's just another one-off antagonist but I don't see how else this plot could have been resolved.  
This movie was awesome, visually. The scenes were beautiful to look at. Not trippy Iike Dr Strange but just outrageous.  
I loved the personal development all the characters experienced. It was fantastically done.  
This wasn't the movie I expected, and to a small degree wanted, but it was so well done I was satisfied. It's not as fun or upbeat as the first one (at least not the whole way through) but very, very good. It's a real 5-bagger.    ",69by9z

dhb0s4i,"I'm seeing a lot of criticisms of how every serious, heavy situation had some sort of joke crammed into it, but watching the movie I felt this was more a character choice in the majority of them, as none of them were really comfortable with the silences or serious beats. It felt natural for this particular cast to be unwilling to dive into emotional sequences too confidently, especially considering [the sequence with everyone panicked for Quill's safety and in respect of Yondou's sacrifice](#spoiler) being the most serious part of the movie and treated as such.",69by9z
dhdf7sj,"Saw the movie last night, and while I don't think it quite measures up to the novelty of the first, I think it's a fine continuation of the series.

Although I knew Kurt Russell would be Peter's dad, I did not anticipate him being a villain/god so that was interesting to me.  Drax retains his title as character I find funniest. Yondu had me tearing up.

Very enjoyable, but I think it has to be acknowledged that we basically have a quirkier Fast & Furious in space with better music on our hands.",69by9z

I liked that they went for a lighter feel, but many of the jokes fell flat, and some of the dialogue was border-line cringe. Seemed a little too conscious of its internet/Tumblr/Reddit - savvy fan base (trash panda joke).

Chris Pratt has honed his acting chops, a bit. Bradley Cooper has some excellent voice acting.

dhtjqfk,I'm so thankful that we had a shirtless Star Lord and then multiple scenes with that glorious tight T-shirt.,69by9z
dmexqfz,"Just saw the movie and... I didn't really like it that much.

Sure I liked it more than I disliked it, but all in all, I thought the plot and mini-plots were just too weak to mean anything.

The jokes and fan service weren't my cup of tea, but I can ignore that sort of thing when it comes to Marvel movies. What I can't ignore though, was the pacing and story. 

For example, what exactly was the main villain's motivation again? He called it his purpose to... absorb planets that had life on them? 

And this would do... what? 

Why did he want to do this? 

Why was he disappointed in mortal life? 

What would absorbing other planets with life on them do? 

Why does it have to be planets with life on them? 

What does he do after he gets what he wants?

Why did he use Yondu to pick up his offspring and bring them to him instead of going to get them himself? I get that he apparently has to go back to the planet, but that's not really explained enough to ascertain how long he has to visit it nor why he can't just take the planet with him where he wants to go.

How did he imagine life and why would he want to ""become"" it?

How the hell did he imagine *human beings* as life? Was he just showing a representation of himself to Quill as human to not be confusing? I'd say probably not, as he also chose that form to fight in.

Why did he kill Quill's mother if he was just going to stay away from her? 

Why didn't he go and pick up Quill after his mother died if she meant so little to him? It's obvious that she didn't actually mean that much to him because he had tried to procreate with literally millions of other beings. There's no way she could have meant that much to him if he threw her away for a ""purpose"" that doesn't even make sense.

After she died, what could possibly tie him to earth if he actually cared about her so much? So, no, I can't believe he really cared about that being the planet that she died on.

Seriously, just what was the villain's motivation in this movie? If it was something ***so important*** that it drove him forward for millions on years of existence, should it have been explained thoroughly enough to be understood?

Gamora and Nebula had a really poorly done sister forgiveness plot. Nothing else to really say, it just felt so forced.

Drax was a parody of himself and was so different from the first movie even though this movie takes place shortly after the first.

Rocket... His character development felt as though they had to force him to evolve for whatever they plan to do with him the next movie. That's what his entire character this movie felt like as a matter of fact. Especially with Yondu and his sudden friendship where Yondu literally takes the time to explain exactly what is wrong with Rocket forcing him to develop as a character with no real motivation.

This movie would be ***fine*** as a turn-off-your-brain-and-enjoy-stoner-movie too, but they tried so hard to end on an emotional note after so poorly developing characters and motivations that it felt like nothing. Hell, it felt like Yondu had to die just to get all the ravagers for the next movie on screen and together, not because he did something noble for a realistic character-motivated reason. I wanted to feel emotional during the scene, but I just couldn't stop thinking about how out-of-nowhere and forced it felt.

I can enjoy the movie and understand how others can as well, but it could have been so much better if ""show don't tell"" were adhered to and if it were so obvious that characters only moved to be prepared for the upcoming films they would appear in. Actually, this seems to be the problem that many Marvel films are starting to have. Organic character development is forgone for the bigger cinematic universe, which really undercuts what each movie could be.

I have no issues with those who enjoyed it, but for me I'd say this is just an average movie. Wasn't really memorable, wasn't really insulting to watch. Just a forgettable superheroish movie that can be fun to watch once, but isn't something I'll watch again unless a friend asks me to at a party.",69by9z

What I liked- 

 Nice character developments all around and it felt like they really stepped up the creativity of the visual designs. They kind of ""leaned in"" on the weirdness of the world and the moral ambiguity which I liked.

Nice poignant tone to the end, I though that really worked. Wholesome. 

A few things I didn't like -

The humor felt more hit or miss this time. When it worked it was hilarious but some jokes felt forced. Glad they still aimed for a light tone even if it was inconsistent.

It felt a little bloated and the pacing felt kind of weird. Could have used another round of editing to trim it down IMO.",69by9z
dh7w9q8,"Great sequel! I thought it was really bold to fit all of the characters from the original (more or less) into this one, and even expand their roles - not just the five Guardians, but Yondu, Nebula, and even Peter's dad were all great additions that were pretty well explored.

The only thing I would say, though - they did end up sacrificing a bit of pacing and had to twist the characters' personalities to work all the characters into the story and give them a satisfying, meaningful conclusion.

Gamora/Nebula was the biggest standout for me as a subplot where the characters just seem to change depending on what the scene calls for. One minute, Nebula is cold-hearted and calculating, understanding that she has to spare Rocket and Yondu because it's more effective to trade them to the authorities for credits and her slice of the dough - and then the next, she's flying out of the sky, screaming with guns blazing, crashing her spaceship into an unknown world (which doesn't have any _other_ spaceships.) 

Drax/Mantis was another one that felt weird, just because I really don't think the characters had any reason to grow close to or talk to one another. They were just hanging out together because the plot needed them to.

We're shown that the Sovereigns are kind of uptight jerks, but we're never really given much indication that they're actually bad people overall. They come after the Guardians because Rocket stole from them, which is entirely within their right, and yet we're still not supposed to sympathize with them because Rocket's on the hero team. I would have been totally fine with that if it was just played for laughs, so that's where the sequel comes in.

We see the Sovereigns' leader becoming progressively more unhinged as the movie goes on. If they actually become the main antagonists of the third movie, it will honestly make the Guardians look like outright villains. Granted they haven't *killed* anyone, but they will have pretty much led to the unraveling of Sovereign society just because Rocket wanted to steal some stuff.

Rocket's character has a lot of depth and sadness to it, which will hopefully be expanded on. His character had the biggest emotional impact on me in both movies.

All the members of the GotG are fantastic characters, and really drive the films. This movie was all about exploring those characters. Loved it. Maybe even more than the first. At least on par.

dh7ygbq,"I enjoyed this movie quite a bit.  I didn't love it like I did the first *Guardians of the Galaxy*, which I watched 5 times on opening weekend.  But I still thought it was great.

Things kinda came to a screeching halt after Yondu, Rocket, and Groot escaped from the mutinous Ravagers.  But hot damn, did things really pick up in the last 15 minutes or so.  The ending had me in tears.  And the use of that Fleetwood Mac song when Peter attacked Ego was among the best uses of music in a film that I've seen.

That James Gunn really knows how to tug on the heart strings.

There were a couple of things that I thought were stupid, though:

Ego was really goddamn stupid for a Celestial.  Millions of years of existence, and thousands of years of experience interacting (and boning) aliens, yet he didn't know how to to keep his mouth shut?  There was no reason for him to admit to Peter that he killed his mother, other than the fact that the movie needed it to happen.  I didn't mind it, though; the idea of a million-year-old god being so dumb is amusing.

Also, Nebula is a terrible pilot and shot.  When she was flying around in a heavily armed starship, she had Gamora dead to rights, but she didn't so much as scratch her.  I guess that cybernetic brain of hers didn't contain the knowledge of how to lead a target.

Other than those two, amusingly silly details, I thought the movie was fantastic.",69by9z
dh892wg,"I just saw it today and loved it. It is a fitting continuation of the first movie and has a great balance of humor and heart. I was impressed with the Yondu plot, and I thought the villains were much stronger in this one. The cameos were especially fun.

Biggest complaints were Kurt Russell's boss mode form and Nebula.  I get what they were doing with Kurt Russell, but it didn't play out well and it looked kinda goofy which took me away from the moment.  As for Nebula, I don't know what's going on there.  I like Karen Gillan, and think she's a good actress, so I expect a lot better from her, but everything with Nebula seems over the top and cheesy.  Not sure if it's her or the direction.  Stop with the angry snarls, it looks silly, not menacing.

Minor complaints aside, I really like the movie, and I really like what Marvel is doing with these characters, and am really looking forward to their next appearance.

Also, props to Dave Bautista's Drax.  I mention this because Drax is getting some hate for being ""over the top"", but that's the joke.  I liked his character a lot.  I'm not always necessarily laughing at what he says, but rather at his character and the way he reacts.  Like, it's absolutely wrong to call the bug girl ugly, but it just works because his character doesn't come across as cruel or mean, even when miming throwing up at the thought of sleeping with her.",69by9z

To me it just felt like the exposition went on too long and then suddenly they were in a battle for the galaxy again at Ego's sudden but inevitable betrayal. 

I was hoping that when said betrayal happened it would somehow incapacitate Starlord forcing the other Guardians to fight without him and rescue him. They did end up having to rescue him but I think it could have been better.

I also missed the planning/scheming that happened in the first movie. I felt those moments really shined and helped highlight the characters interactions and inner thoughts.

dh5p5w1,"I really liked it. I was afraid that with the intro this was going to be a cheap cash grab based on little Groot but they kept it at a good level. throughout the movie.

Michael Rooker was brilliant as Yondu I felt, really happy they fleshed his character out a bit more.

That said, there's only so many 'HAHA DRAX DOESN'T GET THE JOKE' stuff you can make before it gets tiresome. I want them to make it a bit more dark and serious in the next one, otherwise it'll get stale soon. 

I'm really interested in the background of the original Guardians though, hope they provide some more info on that in the next movie.

dh9jlxw,"Usually it's hard to discuss negatives close​ to the release of a movie, but I hope to get some good discussion going. 

The good stuff about this movie has already been discussed pretty well, overall I had a good time. I mostly enjoyed the visuals, the humor worked for me more often than not, the characters are alright generally. I've got some big issues with it though. 

1. Far too many extremely predictable emotional beats. The last few minutes of the movie especially were just extremely predictable line after extremely predictable line. It's almost as bad as if the movie wrote ""here's the scene where all the plotlines and jokes we've been setting up for each character get a nice line or two of resolution"" across the screen. The ""unspoken thing"", ""you're beautiful...on the outside"", rockets lines, etc were such lame and obvious ways to finish off those character arcs, and I didn't like how they were all just unnaturally crammed into like 90 seconds of screen time. This happened way too many times throughout the movie too, I was rarely surprised or interested by how many lines were written - they were just the most obvious and straightforward way of writing the idea that was being communicated. 

2. Baby Groot felt a little forced and overused. A lot of moments with him were meant to be funny or cute but just didn't really do anything for me. I enjoyed a lot of the jokes in the movie, just rarely ever his. Yeah, he's for kids I guess but I have no trouble enjoying good kids humor most of the time and this still fell flat. I also do not like his design, it doesn't visually fit with anything else in the movie, and just looks bad most of the time. 

3. The scene where Kurt Russel explains star Lord's origins was odd. Seemed kind of strange that he'd set up like dioramas in preparation for star Lord arriving,  I got the sense that they just fillmed everyone  looking up at something vaguely in awe and then threw in a bunch of ceramics at  the last minute. It was mostly just a lazy/boring way to do that exposition. This is a more minor complaint I guess. 

4. It had basically another version of the exact same marvel villain formula we've seen over and over. Basically an evil/altered version of the protagonist with similar powers. This was done already in iron man, ant Man, captain America, I think doctor strange if I remember right. Then some glowing blue thing blows up at the end and everything is saved. At least this time it didn't shoot a giant beam up in the sky. But this formula has gotten less effective every time I see it and by now I just felt nothing but boredom from going through those motions again. 

5. Nebula. Her makeup looks awful. Her design is awful. Her lines are mostly awful. Her storyline was not interesting. There was nothing good about her presence in the movie for me. 

Overall it was still a fun experience and if you already like or dislike marvel films this sure won't do anything to change your mind. It was about a 6/10 for me, probably my favorite MCU film since the last Guardians movie. ",69by9z

Everyone seems to agree that the humor felt forced and the pacing was strange, but to me it felt like part of the movie was just... missing.

My two big complaints with the movie:

A: They completely [flanderized](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization) most of the characters. Rocket apparently forgot how sarcasm is used, Drax's misunderstanding of metaphor has become ""I am a huge asshole to people but I think I'm being nice,"" and as far as I'm concerned, Baby Groot is just the Marvel equivalent of Minions.


B: There was no real explanation given for a lot of character interactions. Why were Rocket and Peter suddenly in some sort of dick measuring contest? Why was Rocket such an asshole for the entire movie until suddenly he just sort of wasn't at the end? Why did Peter suddenly care so much about not having a dad? Why was Yondu's first mate (whatever that dude's name was) such an idiot? I pretty much just walked out of the theater saying ""Ok... but why?""

I don't know, there was some nice emotional payoff in some places, but the whole thing just felt like a parody or itself. Or a tribute to itself written and directed by someone who didn't completely understand the first one.",69by9z
dhycqh8,"Just got done seeing this.  Holy shit it was awesome!  So many things stuck out to me...

When Mantis touched Drax when he were remembering his daughter and she instantly broke down was incredible.

Yandu was the best character in this movie.  

That exchange with Rocket and Yandu being the same was really powerful.  

There's a lot more but it's enough that I'm going to see it again in theaters.

dh6l2k1,"I found this film very deep and thoughtful. Initially i thought that the introduction scene between his father and Peter was given away way too early, but for what's to follow, I see why they did that. And when Drax and Mantis were sitting outside on Egos planet, she was going to tell him what's Egos motive is right then and there. Never have I ever seen a guy just rip the carpet from right under you like Egos character. Never did I feel like there was more than meets the eye other than a father that just wants to make up for lost time. And as he was explaining his plan for immortality and controlling the universe I was shocked. Just goes to show you that the grass isn't always greener. Peter inadvertently met his father, and what do you know, his father was a piece of shit. And before Peter could fully embrace Yondu for raising him and for being a fatherly figure, Yondu dies. I'm curious as to the inclusion of Adam Warlock, and the role the GOTG play in the Infinity War. Disappointed in the fact that they had no post credit scene that connects GOTG to Infinity War, no Avengers or anything. Overall I liked the movie, not better than the first one though.

The story had greater potential than the first one, with Yondu and Peter(which was well done but could have been better), Nebula and Gamora(I actually enjoyed these two a lot unlike the first movie), and Ego and Peter, and Drax losing his family with Mantis feeling his pain, all relating back to the center theme, which is family and they all lost someone close to them but they at least have each other now, a new family.

I did have a couple of small nitpicks though:
I didn't like how Peter saw Gamora fall into the hole then didn't do anything, leaving it to Nebula to save her. Compare how Gamora had to be stunned by Rocket to prevent her from going after Peter. 

I also didn't like how Yondu murders all the mutineers. In a way, the ending shows they had been right: he had privileged Peter over all of them.  It also kind of conflicts with the ""redemption"" arc Yondu goes through. He should have spared most of them (minus maybe the ringleaders).

Finally, Rocket knew he gave Yondu a spare suit (and I think a thruster?). He should have known to look for Yondu and Peter right after the crew escaped the planet. Instead, his one line after stunning Gamora made it seem as if he knew there was no chance for Peter to be alive.",69by9z

dh5tnrw,"Overall It was a good movie. It could have been better but I went in their with zero expectations. I didn't give it too much thought, I was gonna see a movie about the guardians of the galaxy saving the galaxy, they would deal with the sovereign, meet Peter's dad who maybe wouldn't be an asshole, maybe he would if they took anything from his comic book dad. What I got out of the movie was character development which is what I wanted the most, sure they save the galaxy, but they grow along the way. 

Peter had issues with his father, or lack of one growing up. But its something he hides, like anyone who grew up without a birth father would do. So this film continues that thread of who Peter's father is and what finding out who he really is does to him. At first he is skeptical, he just comes out of the blue, he's probably after something, which he was sure, but slowly he comes to care about him. But upon hearing his mom died because of his father he reacts like a normal person would, shoots him to pieces. Peter loved his mom, losing her was the greatest pain he suffered, more than not having a dad. And in the end Peter realizes he did have a dad, yondu raised him as his own, sure not the best way, but Peter is who is because of Meredith and yondu. 

Yondu, we learn broke ravaged code when he would deliver the kids to Ego. He didn't know what was happening, to him he was being a good person for great money. The moment he finds out, he saves Peter from the horrible fate that could have awaited him. The man, shunned by his friends for years, raised Peter and always loved him. Which is why the crew mutinies. Because he always looks out for Peter. He's a man who had a shitty life but in the end made the most of it. He sees himself in Rocket however, and warns rocket not to go down the same path. To protect and care for his friends and not betray them like he had. Something rocket takes to heart. He's still an asshole but he goes out of his way to save his friends. Even shooting gamora cause he knows he can't save Peter but he doesn't have to lose her too. 

Baby groot was alot of comic relief, but a necessary one for all the shit everyone had to deal with. It was refreshing a character whose biggest challenge was being taken seriously. But he does pull through in the end. 

Gamora and Nebula, had issues clearly and between themselves manage to work on them. They still have their personal issues with Thanos. They both wanna kill him for their own reasons but here we see why they're even called sisters. In the first film they were raised together into warriors but clearly don't like each other, here we see it wasn't always like that. They did care, but in a hostile environment like the Thanos residence, they chose survival over sisterhood. And this time they choose to be sisters and show that shared traumatic experiences are binding. 

Drax is never getting over losing his family for o virus reasons. His interaction with mantis in that one scene shows it. But he is opening up to his new family. He's got those two issues and one is worked on during the film. This was a guy who nearly got everyone killed in the first movie over his vengeance on Ronan. Now he jumped out of a spaceship to save his friends and family. And continues to show this behavior over the course of the film. 

Overall the film continues the threads established in the first and closes some of them. By the end, Peter is aware of who he is (a guy who had two great parents and amazing family) and who he isn't (a god), Gamora is at peace with Nebula (vs in the beginning where they saved the sovereign just to get her ass and throw it in jail), Rocket is still an asshole, (but albeit a caring one who will probably be less of liability to get them killed. ) Drax is Drax (albeit more open to his new family ). Yondu lead a good life and found redemption in the end. Mantis got out of a clearly abusive relationship and adopted by people who will treat her better (yes even Drax). And groot well he's a teenager now can't say that's an improvement. 

Ps. Loved Stan lees cameo, he's talking about his cameo in Fantastic Four to the watchers, showing he's at least related to them even if he isn't Uatu. Gunn is a great director and franchise runner, cause hey at least Drax and Gamora didn't start hooking up out of nowhere, he'll she didn't even hook up with Peter, they're laying it out but can just as easily keep it platonic.

dh5ucrm,"* The cameo of the original Guardians was pretty awesome
* Yondu was awesome
* A lot of the humour seemed forced
* I was afraid they were going to overdo Baby Groot, but I think they overdid Drax a little instead, although the DraxMantis duo was pretty funny
* The ManofSteelZod clash at the end was a little disappointing, everyone was fighting rock tentacles
* Overall I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie, decent soundtrack too

dh5t6v4,"1) Chris Pratt is more subdued in this movie.  Everyone else gets time to shine.  Especially Drax.


2) There is a pivotal scene where Ego gives Peter Quill the last bit of motivation Quill needs where Ego says that he gave Quill's mom brain cancer.  This feels like a bad choice.  Wouldn't have been better to make Ego somewhat tragic by making the brain cancer natural and having Ego experience real loss?  Then Quill has to make a decision of saving his misguided dad or saving the universe.  It would have mirrored the Gamora/Nebula story closer and been more dramatic than making Ego just plain evil.


3) I should recite my MST3K mantra, but aren't we in the future?  If Yondo is exposed to space for a short to medium duration you'd think they'd have something for that.

Just characters interacting with each other, without having to rush about in a hurry to get all the plot done. 

The movie was, to me, way funnier than the first one. I never thought the first one to be truly funny in the first place. It was quirky and quippy, but I never laughed my head off.

Honestly, i think it boils down to expectations. people didn't know what to expect from the first movie and were blown away, and expectations were high for this one. after having watched the first one again recently, i can safely say i think the GOTG vol. 2 is a better movie.

dhaoxl4,"I liked the movie; it was very emotional; tons of cameos/references/continuity/etc.  Having said that:

[Ego is supposed to be a deity with lots of power.  And he’s been around for millions of years.  How could a being that has spread throughout the galaxy/universe not be able to find Quill? He had relations with countless races; but he chose to send Yondu to find all of the offspring.  Couldn’t he sense all of the offspring even if they didn’t have similar power?](#spoiler)  
[He chose to kill Quill’s mother simply because he didn’t want to change his mind and stay on Earth.  For a being with millions of years of experience/expansion/relationships with other races, he certainly doesn’t have strong will power.](#spoiler)  
[I know he wanted Quill to join him willingly, but I still don’t see the point of taking over everything as himself.  He had lots of experiences/relationships but ultimately wanted to just be a big blob of energy/power spread everywhere. To do what?](#spoiler)
[Why is Quill his only source of energy for one thousand years?  He hasn’t figured out how to use other sources of energy in millions of years?](#spoiler)
[Were all of the skeletons in that cave there because Ego used the creatures for energy?  I think I missed something when they showed those bones and Gamora said “we need to get out of here.”](#spoiler)
[Ego was able to easily destroy the fleet that was chasing the guardians; but how/why couldn’t he sense the guardians when they were dangerously close to his brain? I guess he was distracted while interacting with Quill.  Sure, he stops them temporarily but only when they were about to destroy him, unless he was just toying with Quill.](#spoiler)
[Shouldn’t he have suspected Quill could have learned to resist him being a half deity?  It took Ego millions of years to learn how to expand and use his potential. But it took Quill a very short period of time to learn how to resist/fight him.](#spoiler)
[Ego is a deity but needs an ugly bug to go to sleep.](#spoiler)

[Unless I’m forgetting something, how was it that Quill never discovered his immortality before the events of this film and specifically going to the “home” planet where Ego is? I suspect he had to be near it to manipulate energy.  But I feel like he should have been able to do some manipulation while being near another planet/entity that was created/influenced by his father.](#spoiler)

[What if Quill decided to have kids before he met his dad?  Would that child have (and later lose) immortality/powers?  And I thought Quill should have kept some powers anyway, like Kratos killing Zeus and actually taking his power. Did he actually retain some powers?  What if he can recharge after a while?   I suspect more will be revealed when Quill appears in Infinity War.](#spoiler)

[Rocket was able to plant sophisticated booby traps to stop the ravagers and is able to fight them by himself until Yondu shows up.  And, Rocket has a tool that can repair extensive damages to the ship.  How was it that Rocket can be very resourceful with several advanced tools/weaponry at his disposal but can’t come up with a drone or something to take the explosives to the core of Ego’s brain?  Laser beams/deep space travel/nanotech but no such thing as a remote detonator.  Wait, he used remote detonators throughout the movie, except for when they needed one to destroy the brain core. I guess they needed to give baby groot something to do.](#spoiler)

[Drax also seemed rather useless throughout the movie until he decided to kill the last drone used by the sovereign people.  When they said “weapons are down,” I feel like they had already stopped using them.  Sure that one golden guy was able to pilot the drone more skillfully, but I feel like something was off about that scene.](#spoiler)

The sovereign people also seemed kind of weird. They have a high source of energy with their batteries and a seemingly endless supply of drones. [But they can’t stop one creature, the one at the beginning of the movie.](#spoiler) They also reminded me of several other races/tech from scifi movies. I also feel like they were a shot at white people/racism.  They are perfectionists/supremacists. [Rolling out the carpet so the leader could walk among other people was just comical.](#spoiler) [One guy was able to pilot his drone and damage the guardian ship for a lot longer than everyone else but still gets called a loser/failure since Drax was able to destroy it through desperate measures.](#spoiler)

dh5rs23,"I was fearing the quality of this movie since so many people were saying it was worse than GotG 1 from the early screenings and when a movie is called worse from the screenings that were supposed to bring hype, then you know something is up.

But I genuinely think that GotG 2 is better than GotG 1. I'd put it right with Winter Soldier for one of the better MCU movies. Its largest flaws are mostly some jokes falling flat or being tone-deaf and the pacing in the middle (and I was groaning for the opening scene to end a minute or two earlier) but for the most part I thought it was more interesting than the first movie. For one, every character was given considerably more depth except maybe Peter who stays mostly the same and Mantis who clearly was just kinda shoved in. Gamora and Nebula had probably the weakest interactions and even they were alright whenever they were on the screen. Drax wasn't a random nobody like he was in the first film and one of the best scenes in the movie is when he's asking Rocket where Quill was. It was a 2 hour and 20 minute movie and the main plotline didn't feel at all rushed to me so I don't get all these criticisms of some blazing fast narrative.

Ego is an infinitely more convincing antagonist than Ronan was and ranks pretty highly among MCU villains. People criticizing The Sovereign as antagonists completely ignore that the storyline with Ego is still the focus and they were mostly there to set up the final act and I guess set the stage for GotG 3. The action was loads more entertaining and really showcase the true scale of these characters. The acting was better with Drax, Rocket, and Gamora getting more meaningful scenes.

I feel like people are saying its worse than the first one because the first one caught people off-guard with the weirdness but GotG 2 legitimately makes use of all of its cosmic campiness much better.",69by9z

Kurt Russell was really good, and I like the interaction between starlord and gamora more in this one. Also the gamora/nebula side plot was actually pretty decent, I liked the look at the end. They took Yondu from a goofy character to one that could pull your heartstrings, that was pretty brilliant considering how little characterization he had in the first film. Was not as enthused about the soundtrack this time around, it was good but nothing that really hooked me as much as some of the songs from the first movie. I think James Gunn has now become the king of marvel movies. Joss Whedon is great and all but neither avengers reached this level of pure entertainment.

In a weird reversal, I feel like the strengths of the first film completely reversed in the second film.  I absolutely agree with many reviewers that the jokes and dialogue was VERY forced and for every joke that hit, there were 3 right before it that were big misses.  

For example, the ""baby groot with the bomb"" joke was absolutely brutally murdered to death not only by the trailer, but they then made it a solid 30-45 seconds LONGER in the main film? Was asking for the tape supposed to be that funny? I don't get it.  Similarly, how many dick/penis/body jokes were there throughout this? Just felt so unnecessary and not funny. OF all the characters, Rocket got the brunt of the terrible jokes, perhaps mostly for the the running gag about ""Taserface"" that wasn't all that hilarious.

However, this film absolutely shines in the last 30-45 minutes, and hit the key emotional points in all the ways I wished the first film would've reached.  I finally felt a sense of threat from a Marvel villain, and he wasn't an absolute lame duck. He had some serious power, and while I wish they would've given him more to do, his motivations were clear and were kinda interesting (definite parallels and commentary on the story of Jesus, and I liked the twist). All the character story archs ended in a satisfactory way that didn't feel forced, and man, that final scene and ""coming together"" with the team was awesome.

Man, haven't had this polarizing experience with a film.  I don't think this is as bad as some have said, but it isn't on aggregate as good as the first one, or some of the other marvel great films.  However, what it does well, it does REALLY well.  ",69by9z

It's absolutely fun and has great moments. However I can pretty confidently say that I'm glad Gunn is contained to this series. The frat humor wore thin for me pretty quickly. Everything is in your face and on the nose. The best example being Nebula and the ""ripe root"" joke. SHE didn't have to say it, having her just spit it out would have made the joke. 


I have more to say but I don't want to get *too* shredded here. 

Another big one though.. STOP TELLING US ABOUT THANOS AND SHOW US. This movie definitely marks the point where Thanos will be underwhelming unless we see him do something big when he shows up. Plus.. That was the only connection to the bigger universe, it was kinda weird.

dh5tchm,Anyone expecting Guardians 1 will be let down but this is streets ahead of any MCU sequel. James Gunn is a goddamn mastermind. So much world building happening and still a soild story. I can't wait for Vol. 3,69by9z
dh5upq1,"I found the movie... cluttered.

The main plot about Ego was fairly slow, which isn't a problem in my book, but I'm under the impression the producers were deadly scared people would be bored so they throw they can at the spectator to make the feel more... active? than it really is. Sometimes I really felt like the film was jingling keys at me, the best example of that was the super-space jump with Rocket and Yondu.

Other elements also felt forced to hide the main plot's supposed weakness:

* The Sovereigns' subplot is only that to justify spaceships battles.
* Drax constant jokes are there to hide the fact he doesn't contribute *at all* to the action of the movie.
* Gamora & Nebula subplot is interesting and gives us some nice moments, but is so separate from the rest of the action it could have been in an entire different movie.
* The Ravagers' over-the-top behavior is really thrown at your face by the cinematography in, what I felt, an quantity-over-quality attempt at comedy.

The best characters for me are to be found in the C-line cast. Mantis was the best part of the comedic duo with Drax and was able to both have some character growth while preserving her silliness. However, it's Kraglin who stole my heart. He had that many lines and appearances, but they were enough to make me feel invested: His upmost respect for his captain, his distress when his loyalty is overlooked... It's his reaction during the last scene that brought the most emotion from me. Plus, if one would dissect the movie, I'm pretty sure he contributed more to the story than Gamora or Drax.

Visually the movie is colorful and obviously very well-crafted. It even  has very beautiful moments when it's allowed to slow down (Gamora in the fields, or with Nebula at the end for instance.)

The movie isn't bad, but could have been way better if they polished the main plot to make it strong enough to carry the movie. That way, they wouldn't have to use crowd-pleasers, and visual and narrative noise to fill the gaps.

If you liked the first one, I find it hard to believe you won't like Vol. 2. Personally, I loved both. For me, it hit all the right spots. There were quite a few moments that made me laugh out loud (""Can I pet your puppy?"") and it was appropriately weighty. I saw it in IMAX 3D and left thinking the movie *looked* really cool. 

If for whatever reason you go in expecting something emotionally heavy like ""Moonlight"" or ""Manchester by the Sea"", you won't like it because… well… It's a comic book movie and we need to have a serious discussion about properly adjusting expectations.

dh73j5z,"IMO better than the original, and my favorite MCU movie since *Iron Man*. The first one felt like it *wanted* to be crazier than it actually was, but since 95% of audiences weren't familiar with the comics it had to offset the outlandish visuals and characters with a very formulaic plot and a boring villain (this complaint also applies to *Ant-Man* and *Doctor Strange*). Everything I liked about the first one - the humor, the relationships between the characters, the emotional highs and lows, the music, the lack of shoehorned connections to other MCU movies - was done even better here. 

- Character development for everyone; especially Yondu and Nebula, who I found pointless at times in the original but they made for some of the most emotionally hard-hitting scenes in *Vol. 2*.
- An even more awesome soundtrack. ELO, Fleetwood Mac, Sam Cooke, George Harrison, Cheap Trick, Cat Stevens, Parliament, as well as two great songs I hadn't even heard before with ""Lake Shore Drive"" and ""Wham Bam Shang-A-Lang"". The scenes with ""Brandy"", ""Southern Nights"" and ""Come a Little Bit Closer"" feel like instant classics. Kind of a letdown that ""Fox On the Run"" wasn't in the movie after it being used so well in the trailers, though. 
- Hilarious jokes throughout, especially from Drax. Bautista's comedic timing and delivery is incredible. Some great visual comedy as well. A lot of MCU films feel like they ultimately want to be taken seriously despite constant tension-breaking jokes (one of my biggest gripes with the two Marvel offerings we got in 2016 and especially *Age of Ultron*). *GOTG* clearly doesn't give a fuck about being taken seriously. It's all camp and humor.  
- *Vol. 2* was able to exist completely as its own movie whereas the first still had to include Thanos and an Infinity Stone. 
- Baby Groot was like BB-8 in that I was worried about him being an annoying cutesy character that serves no purpose other than selling toys but he ended up being really charming. 
- Beats most MCU movies in terms of antagonists. Ego is definitely one of the strongest, best-developed villains they've had. Sure, the gold people were lame but unlike Ronan and similar lame MCU villains I don't think they were ever meant to be taken seriously as a threat. The scene with the carpet and the fact that their ships were operated like arcade games gave that impression. It seemed like they were there to me laugh, which they did. 
- That ending. All the feels.  

Overall, there was never a scene where I wasn't entertained as hell. I've seen people calling it slow which I don't really understand. Are we that used to nonstop action in every movie these days that a more character-focused movie (that's still full of insane set pieces) feels slow? As someone who's been relatively indifferent to the MCU for the most part, this was great. I'd actually watch this again at home after seeing it in the theater, which is more than I've had to say about many of the best-received MCU films like *The Avengers* or *Winter Soldier*. ",69by9z
dh82a1u,"Did anyone else feel that they played the ""character bursts into laughter"" bit a few too many times?

-Drax (like 4 times)
-Mantis
-Rocket
-Gold lady (upon hearing the guy's name is Taser Face)

It just got a little too noticeable after the first few times and started to seem way too forced.",69by9z
dh8amxi,That scene with Yondu yelling at Rocket was the best character development I've seen in any of the MCU movies.,69by9z
dhhztdf,"After seeing this I'm actually kind of surprised about some of the flack this film received.

They definitely upped the humour and while certainly some of it missed most of it was terrific. That battle scene towards the end, fucking hilarious moment there. 

That ending though... surprisingly emotional. For a film that didn't take itself seriously the entire time like its predecessor it actually worked. I didn't find myself thinking ""holy shit tone shift"" but that it might've been the most effective emotional moment to date in a Marvel film.

I'm pretty sure others said it before but I also hope Sean Gunn's character is in the next GotG. You always tread cautiously when it comes to a director having their family in a larger part of their film *cough* Coppola *cough* but his character fit in very nicely, surprised that for a guy who you barely notice in the first film turned into a likeable character.",69by9z

But with this movie's humor, and the risks it took with it in serious moments even made that hard to. Pac-Man, David Hasselhoff, and many others made it so hard for my brother, his friends and the whole audience and I to keep our mouths shut during more serious toned moments. This has already topped my favorite Marvel movies for the top spot, and just my favorite movies in general.",69by9z

Didn't like that the group was split up for a lot of the movie, and the stuff on Yondu's ship went on for a little too long and just wasn't that interesting (and the Taserface joke got old very fast), but got better when Rocket and Groot landed on Ego.",69by9z
dh5ib4x,"Quite possibly my favorite Stan Lee cameo appearance, ever, and it debunks the whole notion of *him* being the Watcher.

I really dug how they went about personifying Ego, aside from him being a whole planet with a face on it. At the same time I can't help but feel they infused a little Starfox into him, what with seducing and sexing anything with a pulse. Just about all the character development everyone went through was welcomed. Save for the Sovereign folk, who seemed pretty one-note for the most part. All the gold became an eye-sore after a while.",69by9z
dh5o4eh,"I enjoyed it for the most part, but felt like it felt prey to the ""Big Bad Guy"" syndrome in Marvel/comic book movies, i.e. villains who are so overly powerful that could destroy the universe in a blink of an eye but they all kind of fall stale after a while.

Ego also didn't really seem that cool to me. I mean I love Kurt Russell, but it didn't really capture the Kurt Russell swagger or bravado that makes him, him. Yondu was my favorite of all the characters IMO, his storyline and motivations were great.

dh6bi49,"I'm honestly surprised to see so much glowing praise for the film. I'm also aware I'm inviting downvotes by having a different opinion, so here goes. 

I think the film had some great bits, but I was frustrated by the lack of a conventional narrative structure and forced emotional beats. Mind you, I didn't see the first GotG in theaters so I don't really have any affection for the first film. I think it established a trend of having a more playful and irreverent feel to the comic book movies of the last two years; it's good in my book, but not among my favorites. But Vol. 2 seems like the producers felt what made the first movie successful was having characters that cracked jokes at every turn and never took anything seriously, so they proceeded to jam as many jokes and bits as they could in there, with plot taking a distant second. 

And the thing is, the movie is genuinely funny. Editing, acting, writing, the zune joke at the end, there were only a few throughout the movie that fell flat, in my opinion. But I think the hindrance of capitalizing on something like that, is that the film just felt like a Tuesday afternoon for the Guardians. I never felt like there was anything at stake. I wish I could say that I felt something for Yondu's death, but after the terrible monologue he gave to Rocket, I honestly couldn't. Every emotional moment that we are supposed to feel something for just felt shoehorned in, whether Peter's interaction with his father, Gamora with her sister, there was absolutely no buildup to any of them, except for a 45 second monologue at every interaction, and that is supposed to, what? Change our entire perception of a character? We aren't even introduced to Peter's hang up with not knowing his father until 5 minutes into the film, and who does he meet, not one scene later?

I think the biggest fault of the film is the 2 hour and 15 minute run time. Because I feel like good character development was cut in order to fit more humor in, which leaves the whole film feeling like a string of thinly held together suspensions of disbelief in a Family Guy format. 

In either case, my brother and I did have a genuinely good time, opening night audience always feels great. I don't think the film is as strong as the first, but it's funnier, and I'm definitely looking forward to seeing them in Avengers. ",69by9z

dh5nthp,"""I just got back from the theater and I loved... the second half.

I felt it was too reliant on constant quips for the first half and it didn't ""flow"" like it did in the second one. The moment the suspense would raise it would immediately be brought down by Drax or whomever. It got me worried for the remainder of the movie that the suspense wouldn't pay off. Luckily, however, it did.

Everything from Peter being told about the eternity and onward was pretty much golden. The act, the story payoff, the character payoff, the performances, and so forth. 

As for characters themselves, every single one gets a bigger piece to their puzzle added, making them all feel an infinite amount more human (or, err, down to Earth or where ever they are all from). I'm happy Drax got some emotional scenes, that Rocket's inner workings were finally explored and potentially resolved, and that everyone feels more fleshed out.

The villain, briefly, I think is one of Marvel's best (though not the best). I didn't quite get the ""stale"" feeling we usually get from these and was happy they made him dedicated to a cause, sinister, and a bit complex all at the same time.

As for Yondu, he might have been the standout character, and it was nice how they ended the film with him getting his respects. 

Adam Warlock. Holy fuck. That's all I have to say about that. And as for special appearances, nice to see brief sightings of Howard the Duck and even the Watchers. I'm assuming Fox only has the rights to Uatu and not the Watchers as a whole.

And action, by the way, is awesome. Especially with Star-Lord near the end and Rocket in, well, the entire film. And the arrow. And. And.

I'm so pumped over this film right now, I mean, fuck. Had to get all that out right quick.""

The second half was 8/10. The jokes started becoming fewer and there were also a few in between that I didn't find funny at all. It was also a bit cheesy sometimes, but that's normal in Marvel films (e.g. ""We're not friends. We're family""). Also the action scene at the end was dragged out - easily 10-20 minutes of fighting and explosions.

All in all a great movie though. I really liked it. They should have kept going strong after the first half, but that's ok.",69by9z
dh5x5ki,"I actually really really enjoyed the villain for the first time in a marvel movie, even more so than Loki. I guess in terms of being badass and intimidating, nothing can really beat a celestial.

Overall, After hearing first inpressions, I expected a much messier movie a la Batman vs Superman, but they did a much better job than I thought balancing every character's storyline. It was still messy (and particularly overstuffed with quips this time around) but still highly enjoyable. They could have toned down the whole ""screen-fucking"" final battle a bit, but there were some genuinely cool sequences in there (my favorite was when  Ego's glowing nervous system/muscular system is walking around all menacingly).

Overall, much better than expected and felt like it balanced everything better than say, Avengers 2 did. Still lacked focus and was overstuffed with humor and storylines though. I'd say it probably ranks around 5-6 in my all time Marvel list. (Winter Soldier, GotG 1, Civil War, and possibly Ant-Man being higher) ",69by9z

It also had the chaotic energy of a David Wong novel. It wasn't scared to have tons of murder and cruelty. There's a danger to this movie. The jokes are great, it's really more of a straight up comedy. It has the plotting of a character piece, meandering before finding a villain to fight. It's emotional as well. I don't know, I'm feeling overwhelm by the wild palette of emotions they served up with spectacular colors. I know people who like there super heroes to be gritty and grim will hate this.

But did it seem to anyone like they could of tightened the story up a bit? Either take out the plot with the Gold people or remove the dad story. You could still have the redemption ark for Yandu without the God dad story.  That or remove scenes with the Gold people and focus more on the dad angle, it kind of felt like he came out of nowhere and became a villian really quickly, felt like there was no connection.

Then there was the multiple heart to hearts everyone has. It was like every member of the team had to have a break down and realization of who they were. 1 or 2 are fine but it loses its impact after a bit.

All that being said it was still fantastic, I laughed and the action scenes were fantastic. They make up for the odd plot choices in my opinion.

dhau1rg,"I liked the movie. I'd like to discuss themes, and why making Ego his dad, and Ego's plot, makes sense (or if it does). Also some thoughts about one of the visuals

Themes:
[So Quill had lots of ladies in the first movie, but loves Gamora. Now in the second movie, Gamora and he have an ""unspoken thing"" but he flirts with other girls in front of her, which she says doesn't bother her. Dad shows up, and presents himself as the true lover of his dead mother. But what Ego has actually done has been Ego Panspermia, LITERALLY*](#spoiler)

[So Quill and Us are set up with a choice: will Peter follow in the footsteps of his father, and continue spreading his seed around the galaxy, or will he settle down with Gamora. Ego has a childishly selfish take on his sleeping around, which sets us up for Quill to reject it and settle down with Gamora (in the 3rd movie, i guess, or at some time when Gamora gets to resolve *her* father issues!)](#spoiler)

I have to say Ego is [pretty stupid to tell Quill he had to give his mother a brain tumor](#spoiler). I can't really explain why that makes sense. Thoughts?

When Ego's [Panspermia](#spoiler) plot get's put into motion, am I cray cray to think that the visuals look like [literal semen erupting covering everything? Ego reproducing is dangerous and violent I gueiss is the thematic idea, but i thought it was an interesting literal touch. Oh also, Ego likes Egg shaped ships and designs too](#spoiler)",69by9z
dhbml0q,"Saw this past afternoon. I kinda regret not preordering my tickets for a Friday/Saturday night showing with a group, but at least people want their [HDSR's](#spoiler) in the morning I guess... 

[Stan Lee appearance was probably the greatest cameo he has done, beside the Deadpool 2/Logan one.](#spoiler)

I rewatech Guardians 1 Sunday night and it was good, but I think 2 was even better. With the MCU, I feel the Guardians have a proper introduction, as it was just a Star Lord appearance in one with the infinity stone. 

[Hated the Adam Warlock tease, haha. LIKE COME ON!](#spoiler)

I thought the Jokes / Laughter were on point on where it was needed. I felt all of the actors/actress's put on their best performance and it felt good.

Seeing the Original Guardians at the end of [Yondu](#spoiler) and a ""hint""(I doubt Gunn will do it) was a proper scene. Interesting that Stallone decided to be in the MCU even if it will be brief or not, but good on him to get on that role. 

With all the post credits scene, it felt like a proper introduction into Infinity Wars for sure. 

I give this a solid 10 out of 10 in my personal opinion. ",69by9z
dhcoq7e,"Am I the only one that didnt like Ego as the villain/plot?  Just something about a CGI skeleton, those weird mannequins retelling the story, being a literal brain, etc.  Everything else was enjoyable but the story was totally lacking and didnt have the adventure feel of the first one.

dh7j1fr,"To be completely honest, I wasn't a huge fan of the movie. Yes. It was really funny and touching at times, but the story and action was very disappointing . The villain once again was forgettable (just like every villain besides Loki). What's bugging me about Marvel right now is how much each movie feels like an episode in a season. This felt like one of those ""filler episodes"" and I can't escape that idea. It actually sucks for me to say it because the first Guardians was one of my favorite movies of 2015. 

I'm not saying it's a terrible movie by any chance, I'm happy I spent the money to go see it. The movie was very funny. Drax was hilarious, Groot was adorable, Rocket and Yondu teaming up was bad ass. It just didn't have that wow factor that I used to have with Marvel movies.",69by9z

dh5fut2,"I loved it because it made the first one better. My biggest gripe about the first is the characterization. Each character has a tragic back story, but all the movie does to portray that is to have them talk about it. I'm not saying you need a detailed flashback for each one, but at least give them situations to behave in a way that expounds on that story. The closest it came to that was when Drax called Ronan, and that just felt out of place because the other characters weren't as active. This one gave them each a foil for more intimate scenes that really built character and helped to add depth to their stories. The writing was better, and even though the humor was slightly over the top at a few moments and the plot dragged due to predictability, I like this one better. ",69by9z
dh5h6wg,"I thought the movie was amazing, it really makes difficult for me to decide which of the two is the best.

Anyway.  Yondu.  What a great arc.",69by9z
dh87juc,"Loved the movie. Maintained that same fun, action, and comedy as the first but had this extra emotional edge. James Gunn and the whole cast knocked it out of the park. Fantastic sequel that could be used as a blueprint.

Only two things I want answered,

1) Why did Ego give Quill's mom cancer? Is it implied it is a side effect of mating or did he just do it for the lols?

2) What was the code that Yondu broke for the Ravengers to betray him and how did him sacrificing himself change that?",69by9z
dhkrkcs,"I really like the movie but I do think there's some forced exposition, too many conveniences, and too short of a time period between one scene and another where characters act differently. Such as the huge cliche with Star Lord and Gamora arguing about what Gamora had just encouraged minutes before. 

There should have been a little more story going on. An urgent reason to kill Ego as well considering he couldn't go through with his plan solo and every second they were there endangered all of his friends. They could have fled and it would be relatively ok for the time being.

More action with the planet itself would have been cool too, so many crazy things could happen with fighting a literal planet. The Sovereign should have been attacking Ego too as he was harboring them as far as the knew, again, more back and forth action happening involving Ego. Merge the two villains together and have them conflict with one another during the finale instead of the Sovereign being a nuisance for a few seconds. 

Again, still liked it a lot, I can watch it over and over, but I have lots of things I'd personally change to improve it.

Also, Drax did nothing in this. He didn't fight a single person outside of that opening scene with the monster, which was just a gag. He should have fought some avatars of Ego or something. He doesn't get anything to do at all beyond bond with Mantis. 

In terms of satisfying action moments for the characters Guardians 1 gave everyone more to do but Rocket, Yondu and Star Lord did get to shine in volume 2.

This really is similar to Empire Strikes Back in terms of lots of character development for a splintered team, and Ego's planet was basically Cloud City, but Empire Strikes Back had a more immediate threat throughout the film.

Still think it's weird Ego had no reaction at all to the Sovereign showing up, being literal fleas on his back. Wonder if there were deleted scenes addressing this. Unfortunately being a Disney movie means we won't get an extended cut. The one thing I absolutely hate about Disney.",69by9z

dhkbrup,"I'm pretty in the minority here, but I was let down by the film. It felt *super* safe and seemed made just to market Baby Groot. I'll be interested to see the #s when they are inevitably crunched, but I'm pretty sure Baby Groot had the most screen time in the film out of the lead characters.

I was okay with the plot, loved Kurt Russell, Rocket Raccoons development was great....but i hated all of the cheesy jokes. I have no problem with Guardians being the lighthearted franchise in the MCU but.. nipple chafing jokes during the climax of the film?

If Guardians Vol 1 was an 8.5/10 for me then Vol 2 was closer to a 6.5/10. Still fun, still rewatchable, but it never hit the right notes consistently enough for me.",69by9z
dhlc31u,"I haven't read all of the comments because there are a lot, but so far, I've yet to see anyone address a big problem that I had with this movie. It seems that every marvel movie (and a lot of non-marvel action movies) have a climax that revolves around saving the entire world from destruction. When these are the stakes of EVERY SINGLE MOVIE, it gets hard to be emotionally invested in the heroes' goal. In GOTGV2, it was THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE AT STAKE and there were two massive problems I found with this:

1). They didn't build it up very well. They treated it exactly the same way the treat the situation when it's just the whole world at stake so I didn't feel all that invested despite the fact that the stakes were much higher.

2). Hasn't Marvel been making all of these movies to lead up to Infinity Wars? I was under the impression that all of these superhero movies have been for the purpose of putting together the avengers to fight Thanos in this massive battle that's going to take two movies to show. I'm not a huge comic guy (I'm familiar with most main stories, but I typically have to google the meaning of the end credits scenes), but I was under the impression that The Infinity Wars was this huge ordeal in the comics so they were going to make it a huge thing in the movies as well. So shouldn't it have bigger stakes? How can the stakes possibly be any bigger than the destruction of the entire universe?",69by9z

Baby groot was pushed into the spotlight often which felt forced after a while. All in all it was a good film and an enjoyable experience and I would recommend any fan of the first to go see.

dh5wc8l,"I thought it was enjoyable. A little bloated but worth the watch. I enjoyed it more than the rest of the sequels in the MCU. Basically, the entire story was easy to guess from the getgo but the movie is more about the journey than the destination. 

The movie seemed like the studios forced the writers to incorporate the same stuff from the first one but IMO they went overboard. Some of the songs detracted from the scenes, dropping a quip after a serious moment seemed dumb, and the ~~toy ad~~ Groot cutesy stuff. 

Drax was really funny, I thought tying the Starhawk stuff to the current crew was neat, Michael Rooker did an amazing job as well(don't bring him back Marvel, let the dead stay dead). ",69by9z

There were some moments where they might have over tried a little with the humor, but there was a lot of actually funny moments. Never have I laughed or heard other people laugh at theater so much. Here in Finland crowd is usually silent at least in the theater I go to.

I really loved the colors. It was really colorful movie and the camera movement was really smooth. I loved it.

Movie plot was sort of predictable but I didn't mind it that much because the visuals, humor and other small things were enjoyable.

From *my* scale this movie was really solid 8/10, maybe even 9/10 because it was really funny. I'm certainly gonna watch it again when Blu-ray comes.

James Gunn has come a long way from writing those Scooby-Doo movies. What I love about this movie is one of the things I loved about the first that carries into this film: the characters. Not only the Guardians I got to like in this but also other characters old and new. By the end of the first movie, we got the guardians come together to officially become a team. In this, we establish that though they're a team they’re far from becoming a family due to the constant bickers between Rocket and Quill. Thanks to the love and care that Gunn put into his script for this film, not only do we get to sympathize with the Guardians but also with characters such as Yondu and Nebula. This might as well be a Fast & Furious movie because this film is all about family.

This feels like it wasn’t a sequel primarily made to develop the Marvel Cinematic Universe but to develop its characters in the Guardians of the Galaxy Universe. Not only this movie builds up the main characters, side characters, and everyone that we were introduced to in the first movie. Damn near everyone has a surprising depth of character even down to Yondu’s right-hand man Kraglin. This doesn’t really tie into the MCU’s main storyline at all, but that’s perfectly fine. 

The humor in this is very scattered but in the best way. Though the jokes are laugh out loud funny whether it be a visual gag or a physical joke, the verbal comedy is mostly a full circle joke where one line that's mentioned once as a quote comes back to become a punch line. but yet some of the jokes are random and funny as hell. It sticks with the regular tropes and setup of comedy. It goes against it by satirizing with dark tropes that you see in something like a DC movie, but then it just gets silly, but I’ll be damned if the comedy wasn’t true to the characters. Peter makes 80s references, Drax is dumb and speaks whatever is on his mind, and Rocket is an asshole. Honestly, my personal favorite is Rocket because he’s pretty much Archer in Raccoon form.

In every Marvel movie, the biggest complaint is the villain and how he has no depth. That was pretty much everybody's biggest issue with the first Guardian flick. This team was just going p against a powerful brick whose name you immediately forget after you finish watch it. I know the villain’s name was Ronin, but it took me five minutes to remember because of how unmemorable he is. In this, Gunn establishes these characters are the Galaxy’s Spidermen because they don’t give two shits about who they go up against. They will talk shit about whoever they’re fighting against and at the end of the day, add you to the “to kill” list. There are only two villains in this movie, but the one I had a problem with was Ayesha played by Elizabeth Debicki. There’s not much to her character except watching over people and giving orders.

dh6u254,"Shout out to whatever middle school boy they got to write the dialogue for this movie. 

Guardians was one of my favorite comic book movies. But if I hadn't gone to this with someone else I would've left. It was like the Walmart version of the first film. 

All the characters got flanderized. Groot was literally only there to look cute. The crew of Yondu's ship were immensely hammy and just flat out stupid. Gamora was more or less reduced to Quill's love interest. Her sub-plot with Nebula could've been wrapped up in one scene. Hell, I would've rather they put it off until the next movie instead of making Nebula, a super badass, into a character who cannot do a single thing correctly. 

Mantis is basically there to play off of Drax, the most annoying character from the first movie. I know reddit loves his character, but it's incredibly grating and lazy. Having Drax and Mantis will probably keep me from seeing the third in theaters. 

Everyone knows Rocket is a jerk to keep people at a distance. But like the rest of this film, they felt it needed to be said out loud. I think one of the biggest flaws of the Marvel movies is having their characters flat-out say everything that's happening and their feelings. They must think the audience is about as smart as they write Drax because they don't leave a goddamn thing to the imagination. 

That said, Ego was cool. When I heard he'd be the villain I thought they were going to throw out the living planet part. He'd have been a lot better if he didn't wax poetic about his evil plan with super on-the-nose lines like every other character. 

This was basically the first movie but worse in every possible way. Hopefully others feel the same and let Marvel know so we don't get a further watered down product the third time around. ",69by9z

""I just want to cover every single planet in the universe in this goop.

But the movie also sucked in major ways. Gamora and Nebula's scenes were boring and completely forgettable, the plan to kill Ego was so bullshit it hurt, Yondu's death funeral lasted a bit too long imo, the mid section where nothing happened was dull, etc.

It was better than the first in some ways, and worse in others. The movie is definitely worth watching, but it's not perfect, and I don't think the great moments totally make up for the bad stuff. Not my favorite marvel movie, but definitely not the worst. Probably somewhere in the middle.

dh6ldmn,"This is most likely an unpopular opinion, but I didn't quite like it.

It felt like a big joke, and not necessarily a good one. Things I disliked: 

* the Sovereign felt like a cartoon of a cartoon character, lacked actual weight and meaning, and didn't affect the story in any way
* Ego being a god that mastered the art of manipulating matter after millions of years, and Peter managed to give a fight after what, two days? only, because he used his heart to focus. This reminds me of The Force Awakens, when Rey just takes two deep breaths and almost beats Kylo.
* Mantis could have just told them from the beginning that Ego was a murderer psycho, but then the story would have been 30 minutes shorter.
* The jokes didn't land at all, often. Not sure if they tried to make the humor more for kids, or if they just had to put jokes in it for the sake of having jokes, but they made me roll my eyes, more often than I would have expected.

* The sister conflict between Gamora and Nebula. I simply couldn't give a damn about them.

* Baby Groot was annoying. I felt the writers were only appealing to the cuteness of ~~it~~ him to make us forgive them for the issues in the story. He felt like the Minions, in my opinion.

* The soundtrack wasn't nearly as good as the first one.


I do have to highlight a few positives:

* Freaking Yondu is a great character. Sad to see him die.

* Drax and Rocket were also great. Drax was particularly more hilarious compared to GoTG1. Rocket I will always love. He has depth. He's funny, he's crazy, but he's also vulnerable.

Anyway, that's what I felt.",69by9z

1. It was to much of a comedy in the beginning. Hell even a Will Ferell movie has some time between the jokes to set a story. It just felt forced. Later in the movie though the jokes were much more apart and felt natural. 



2. Two gods that can't die fight eachother. I just felt like I wasted time watching that. Many movies does this and it annoys me so much. I mean sure you can agree that Ego is trying to wear Starlord down to the point of him joining his father, but still...",69by9z
dh9zuq9,"I really want someone to change my opinions, but I was really underwhelmed with this movie. 

* Almost every scene follows the same outline (slow buildup, short serious action, joke). A lot of the jokes and gags in between the serious scenes were really jarring and took me out of the moment. 

* The movie seems to rely too heavily on music to convey the emotions of the characters instead of letting the emotions naturally emerge through the acting. Many exchanges could have happened without background music if the tone and delivery of lines was better. 

* The pacing is all over the place. When the group crash lands on the first planet, the pace is never really set, as the tone jumps from chaotic to awkwardly sentimental when Ego shows up. Then the movie tries to lull the audience into a false sense of comfort on Ego's planet, but there is not enough development for the audience to have any attachment to Ego when he reveals his true plan.

* The characters act like complete caricatures of their previous movie appearances. Starlord acts surprisingly emotionless throughout the movie, maintaining a blank stare most of time. Drax is only in the movie to laugh obnoxiously loud as a cue for the audience to also laugh. Groot, as usual, is just a plot device and slapstick character. Gamora is supposedly the rational one in the group, but never has any real influence on the other characters except for a short obligatory love scene with Starlord. 

* It seems like the omission of explicit language in the film was only to appease the rating system. The use of ""turds"" and other childish words seemed strange when ""shit"" and ""dick"" were also said.

* The only characters that have worthwhile growth over the film are Rocket and Yondu, whose interactions in the film compliment each other. I think this is mostly due to Michael Rooker's acting because his character isn't two-dimensional like the other characters. Yondu's presence helps whichever character he is with, which happens to be Rocket a majority of the time.

Overall, I think this movie was just a lazy filler movie to introduce new characters and lead up to Infinity War, like some other films did before The Avengers.",69by9z
dhcfs48,"The only real problem I had wit the movie was that it seems like the soundtrack was shoehorned into the movie at every chance.  Every action scene has a slo-mo shot with a song playing.  As if they designed the scene with the song in mind before the scene was finished.

I love the soundtrack though.  I guess that's something I've noticed in more movies lately.",69by9z

dh5ffj8,"Really not happy with it. I'd say it's an above average film dragged down by endless problems.

The following turned out really negative but it's cause I loved the first film and a year ago Guardians would have been my surest best for my favourite superhero film.

**Pros**

The Visuals are outstanding. Truley one of the best looking shots I've ever seen on a screen. It can get flusttered at times but there's some great things in here.

This the funniest Marvel film, period. I have grown tiresome of the Marvel quips but because I think the scenes are set up around jokes the humour works a lot better.

Character Wise: Drax. Stole. The. Show. Groot is pretty good, a friend thought it was too much but I loved it. I though Mantis was good too but all my friends didn't like her. Nebula grew on me.

The Nebula and Gamora relationship also grew on me. And it actually fits in with the larger MCU in a way i love. 

**Cons**

Wanna know why this movie isn't good, it's big emotional hook at the end is Yandu's death (which doesn't work because of cheerful music in the background) and we are suppose to care cause he's Peter's real dad. But Peter and Yandu literally don't meet until the last action scene. So who cares? He's not his real dad just cause you say it, Peter hated him in the first one.

There's basically no plot. I won't dwell on this because everyone else but yeah nadda. 

People seem to be agreeing that the first half is bad and the second half is better but I think the middle is the worst part. There is literally 4 or 5 character monologue scenes where they are just telling us their dramatic background and then we skip to the next. I felt really artificial. 

The main crew spends 70%~ of the film on one planet (Ego). This is Marvels space film and Starlord is stuck mulling around Dads house.

Ego as a villain. It was so painfully obvious and they know it is because Gamora says he's evil so why hide it? He's a literal planet, he should be a big memorable villain. But no. Also that bit at the end where he's like ""oh yeah I gave your mom a tumour"" is such bullshit. Also what was his goal exactly . If he succeded he wouldn't have a purpose anymore, then what? That's his whole thing.

I don't remember any of the soundtrack, maybe it's cause I'm not as familiar with it but I can't remember a song from a sequel to Guardians of the Galaxy!

Character wise: They turned Peter into the lead straight-man, Gamora into the boring mom of the group, and Rocket is less funny and more asshole for an arc that goes nowhere.

That whole Peter and Rocket are fighting went nowhere.

The Gold Soverign people sucked. 

The Stan Lee cameo wasn't good, but I have disliked these for a while. Nothing will be worse than Tony Stank though.

After credits scenes: bad, the worst comedy in the movie. Real sour note. And the Adam Warlock thing was handled really bad. They really need actual stingers for these things.

Overall I think the metacritic score is fair, I'd probably rate it lower. Tipid recommendation for comicbook fans.

dh5tpnj,"I walked out of the cinema disappointed... But looking at these comments I guess I am in the big minority.

I thought it was the worst Marvel movie in quite some time. Probably bottom 3~. It was entertaining but man it pulled me out of the experience plenty of times and the humor didn't work at all.

I'll rewatch it in English at some point. Maybe that'll be better. The dub felt weird at times. It's the price you pay when you watch movies with friends.

The CGI was nice. The music was nice... The dialogue was 50% exposition, 50% out of place jokes and 50% bad writing.

The pacman scene, the ""what are you going to do with your money, Gamora?"" scene, the ""needle kills everyone but no one shoots or does anything"" scene, the ""oh I'm about to tell you something terrible but nah"" scene... And a bunch of others... Nah.

The sentimental scenes didn't work at all because by that point I was so confused by the pacing, the out of place scenes, the poorly developed relationships... I just couldn't care.",69by9z
dh5hf27,"This was a really fun movie. 

If i were to compare it to the first i'd say they were almost even, with GOTG being ever so slightly better than VOL 2. This one was a lot funnier and packed with great characters which is why i felt the overall plot was lacking a bit. I dont know if im giving it a pass since GOTG has my favorite comic book hero (Star Lord) but with everything in the MCU on the GOTG side being outside of Earth, it makes sense for them to play it safe. They got the wonder of Marvels outer space to play with.

This film had some of the most forced humour I've ever seen. Drax in particular made me cringe during multiple scenes. He was so all over the place as a character, and didn't even resemble the how he acted in the first movie. 

Somebody needs to tell James Gunn, and those who loved the character development in the film, exactly what character development is. Character development isn't the movie literally stopping in its tracks, having its characters just tell another character their backstory. The scene when Yondu and Rocket were thrown in jail blew me away in the worst way. He just mumbled his backstory and I couldn't understand it. 

One of the most baffling scenes I've ever seen in my life was when Yondu and Rocket exited their journey across the galaxy. They're literally laughing and having a good time, then Yondu immediately turns to Rocket and explains to us exactly what Rocket's problem is. And it was very cliché. The whole ""can't accept love and thus pushes characters away"" doesn't make me feel for a character. And the fact that this little exchange gave Rocket and Yondu this brotherly bond was insane. 

There's so much more. God, there's so much more. ",69by9z
dh7mdny,"Spoilers ahead. They took everything that was good with the first movie and turned it up to 11, which is not necessarily a good thing. 

1. The jokes were funny but came at terrible times. Because of that, I couldn't get emotionally invested in situations where jokes ruined the moment. Literally the same criticism I had with Age of Ultron. 

2. The team was split up for a good majority of the movie. Even the climax only featured Ego, Quill and Yandu. In fact, now that I think about it, there wasn't a single time where the whole team were working together EXCEPT for the brief period they were trying to insert the bomb into the 'brain' (and the beginning, but it was the intro)

3. Although Drax was hilarious, he was much more one dimensional in a lot of ways than in the first movie. He didn't do much other than joke and save Mantis. With that said, the scene where Mantis felt Drax's pain was very good. I wish they explore his storyline more.

4. The emotional scenes came COMPLETELY out of nowhere. It was jarring in a lot of ways, especially compared to the tone of the rest of the movie. Nebula and Gamora's conflict should've been explored a little more the last movie in order to make the whole 'I wanted a sister' transition to work. Ego suddenly appearing like that was also jarring. I don't know, it's hard to pinpoint exactly what was wrong, but the complete tonal shifts between scenes was weird. It could've been spread out over another movie to have more of an emotional impact. 

5. The only exception to this is Yandu. Incredible arc. The ending was great, no complaints there.

Overall, it was a decent movie, but I left disappointed. It was like the writers suddenly realized they needed to flesh out the characters and because of that had everything happen at once in shouting matches or one-on-one faceoffs. The humor was good but didn't fit the tone of the scenes in many parts. All in all, another middle of the road Marvel movie for me.",69by9z
dh5r3wy,"I saw the movie last week when it came out in the UK, and unfortunately it still leaves a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.

I think this movie had a lot of potential, but fell a bit flat. It relied far, far too heavily on the safety of the typical and predictable idiotic Drax to spout something stupid and to insert Baby Groot with him doing something cute or funny whenever they wanted extra laughs. Seriously at certain points the formula was literally going back and forth between stupid Drax and cute Groot to the point of it being both boring and tedious. The only time I think any of the Groot humour worked was in the brilliant opening sequence, but unfortunately I couldn't view that scene properly because I was too busy worrying if Baby Groot was going to be shoved into as much of the movie as possible, and unfortunately he overstayed his welcome far too much.

For me the movie just failed to strike a balance between emotion and levity, which is a damn shame since the first movie got this down perfectly. Marvel has a major problem with not letting a moments emotion and drama escalate. The moment any sort of tension goes on long enough, they cut it out with some easy humour. Audiences laugh, LEBESTMOVIEVAXD ensues. So it was a pain when after the last movie James Gunn balanced the tone so well, that in this movie we get the villain say that he put a fucking tumor in the main characters mother, only for no less than 30 seconds after to have the whole theatre laughing because they gave David Hasselhoff a cameo. What an absolutely cheap way to ruin pretty much all of the dramatic tension and emotion. I presume because they didn't want the kiddies and families there for the usual cute Groot stuff to be overcome with too much legitimate drama as opposed to constant, samey ha ha jokes. Oh well.

The story was also a major disappointment, but not because of a unique ""day in the life of the GOTG"" structure, but because you cannot give a ""day in the life"" sort of event and then have it have literally universe spanning consequences. It has absolutely no tension whatsoever. This is a movie that is about Ego taking over the universe and being so close to doing so, yet we just don't feel anything. We know that this will not happen. Added to that, his bloody narrative can be boiled down to like 5 scenes and somehow that is padded out in 2 hours.

For me it was a bad movie splitting up the team for so much of the movie because it stopped the group dynamics. I understand why they did it, but it left less time for them growing as a family. This sort of separation, along with a day in the life narrative, belongs in the Telltale game and not a 2 hour movie. The only splitting up I liked was Yondu with Rocket, but that dragged on far longer than it needed to especially with that scene of HAHA LE GROOT DOESN'T UNDERSTANDZ WAT THE FIN IS XDXDXD. Just get on with the fucking movie. 

Speaking of Yondu, I felt nothing when he died. Why? Because for a movie meant to be about him being Peter's ""real"" father, they barely interacted. If much of the movie is about Ego as his parent, then we simply need to have time with Yondu and Peter to ride home the comparison. His death felt unearned to me due to the lack of clearer/developed moments between the characters. 

Finally, what the fuck was the point of those yellow people besides setting up something for the future? Their reasoning for hating the GOTG was far too basic and they were nothing more than a way to pad the time out. They should have only appeared at the opening as a way to show the expanse of the world and then move on from there, they added a grand total of a fuck all except tedium whenever they were on screen. Especially that garbage about their ships being like arcade simulations. Ha, how funny. 

Honestly the best part of the movie for me was seeing The Watchers. I didn't expect that, and I hope it's a subtle way of setting something up for the future, but who knows. I was a little disappointed with the music this time around, I think this part was a case of the movie trying to one up the original but it fell a bit flat. Sometimes they felt forced and some of the songs just were quite forgettable. That may just be me though because I know plenty who loved the soundtrack, but I definitely think this one has more of an acquired taste. I doubt many of these songs will have the same cultural impact the first movies songs did. I don't expect many bar one or two to start playing in parties on the regular, i'll put it that way. 

Overall I was pretty disappointed. I'm baffled as to how many of my friends are saying it's amazing, because excluding the fact it pales in comparison to the original, it is just overall worse from a filmmaking point of view on things such as story, pacing and tone. With how much my theatre was laughing it just showed how much the MCU ha ha formula is a guaranteed success. Seriously that's all these movies need is mindless jokes and people will say they're amazing. I get it, people can like what they want, but this movie could have been better despite it being a solid bit of entertainment so I hate how basic the opinions boil down to, all because of a few ha ha jokes.",69by9z

Awesome movie but I feel this line should have been removed... what Ego should only wander initially, is if there are others like 'him'.  So maybe only should have had him say that he sought after others like him, if he's truly alone in the universe, etc. then after his first discovery of life, how surprised he was when he discovered how fragile and different life was compared to him. Also the part where he said he imagined what he felt to be the 'ideal' biological form? a Human form?...

I know stories don't need to make sense, but it should make sense at some fundamental level? I feel like it could have been better if he took the shape of the biological forms as he encountered them. So he looked human when he visited earth..etc.",69by9z

First, the good

* ""He may have been your father, but he wasn't your daddy""

* Mantis crying upon touching Drax

* Rocket bonding with Yondu

* Yondu death + funeral

* Toe scene

* The opening five minutes - wow

* Gamora & Nebula development


Next, the bad, the oh so very bad

* Horrible villain - Love Kurt Russell, but lets review (1) he turns into a large blue talking head, (2) he is basically omnipotent but cant' stop a twig from laying a bomb or really do anything on his own planet to stop a few insignicant specks, (3) can't fight Quill AND do something at the same time - this is a god, right, (4) he can do anything on his planet so he leaves a crater full of his kid's bones for someone to find, (5) he can do anything, but sleep, (6) it takes him 30 years to find Quill, (7) he stupidly blurts out that he killed Quill's mother - and why, for what purpose even, (8) so much stupid.

* Horrible motivation - he wants to destroy the world, because?

* Too much exposition - Quill literally says at one point ""if we drill into his heart he will die"" - first, how the fuck do you know that, and second, do we really need you to tell us that?

* The ""god"" has a ""heart"" in the center of a planet that looks like a wrinkled brain (ugh)

* The gold-race of folk has bones, but then they just become an annoying distraction - they could have played an excellent foil (the idea of communism, shared roles, building something) to the villain (wants to kill everyone and destroy all) but nothing came of their juxtaposition

* Baby Groot was great in the first five minutes, then just sort of the same joke over and over - the toe scene basically got replicated with the bomb scene at the end ... we get it, he's a liability - would have liked to have seen SOME growth in this character

* Sly stallone - I LOVE this man, but he just seemed so out of place in this movie

* So so so many missed opportunities - (1) I wanted Nebula to say ""had you only wanted to be my sister instead of winning, you could have shared in my pain"" or ""halved my pain"", (2) Quill can make balls of energy - he should have actually made some of the ""weird"" shit he alluded to, (3) talking of Quill - where was he in this movie - yes this isn't all about him, but his being human is what grounds the movie and is needed more of in order to ground the other characters and the settings

* So many cheesy lines and scenes - when Ego and Quill started playing catch, I was waiting for the punch line ... nope 

* Did anyone feel like the transition shots were very poor - no fluidity from shot to shot, very poorly edited in my opinion

In short, because I love the characters, this was a good sequel, but not great and no where near the film we deserved or could have had.",69by9z
dhaajoy,"I fully expected this one to be worse than the original. That's how Marvel works, the moment you get excited for their movies they get terrible again. (See: Age of Ultron, Iron Man 2.) But I thought this movie was great.

It fully fixed the biggest problem with the first Guardians movie: the connections to the Marvel universe. Yeah, they mention Thanos, but we don't have a stupid McGuffy Stone, you don't have a boring buzzkill villain, and we don't have pointless scenes involving characters for another movie. (Unless you count all that business with Syl Stallone, but even a minute of Stallone for any reason is a plus to any movie.) Ronan the Buzzkillington ground the first movie to a halt every time he came around to be boring and unfun. Huge improvement with Ego.

This really felt like an episode of a large Guardians TV show. This reminded me of a really good Futurama episode. It's got a wacky SciFi premise but it matters deeply to these characters. Sure, not every character has much to do - Groot just acts cute and Thrax only belly laughs. But otherwise it's a solid exploration of the characters. And it's one of the only Marvel movies that feels like it's meant to stand on its own. It isn't some set-up for some other thing, it isn't a bland corporate vision. It's clearly James Gunn's movie. And if it's loud and indulgent, that's fine, because you can feel a real pulse behind this thing. James Gunn is having fun and so am I.",69by9z
dh5txmm,"67 on Metacritic is about right. Average movie, not as good as the first. ",69by9z
dh8csuf,"Is no one else saying it? I'll be that guy. When it comes to faults and missteps, Vol. 2 is incredibly similar to Suicide Squad.

By far, the biggest problem was that our GotG were passive protagonists. Instead of pushing the plot forward on their own actions and motivations, Vol. 2 happens TO them. They're just along for the ride to try to beat baddies and survive. 

Yondu was the cause of the entire problem. Don't get me wrong -- Yondu is the best part of the movie and I am incredibly relieved that the red murder arrow is sticking around, but bringing him into the fam was a clearly a major goal of the film. That meant that they had to solve the problem of getting him out of the Ravagers. They had to work backwards from that point to justify it, and that became the entire first act:

Why would Yondu leave his crew? ► Well, what if there was a mutiny? ► Why would there be a mutiny? ► Yondu is always backing Quill, maybe that finally gets to them too much? ► Why would they finally crack about him coddling Quill? ► What if they got in trouble with ALL of the Ravagers because dealing with kids was super-Ravager-illegal, and since Quill is one of those kids, now they're extra pissed about it? 

A good half of the movie is there for no other purpose than to get Yondu to join up with the GotG. AND THEN HE DIES. This was Yondu fanfiction with the GotG along for the ride as passive protagonists.

Other shared faults:

- Weird tonal problems: The GotG are not good dudes. They are down to murder some bitches should the need arise. That said, there was some shown violence that felt very out of place when mixed with Whedonesque snippets of dialogue and dong/poop humor. We didn't need a slow-mo zoom shot of red murder arrow whistling through a dude's chest. The most blatant example that I can think of is when Yondu's crest-fin-thing got shot. We the audience (at least, those who aren't versed in the comics) don't know what that fin does. Personally I thought that we had gone from banter to watching a main character shot in the fucking head. If they had reigned in the visible gore some and brought up the intelligence level of the humor I think that the tone would have been far more cohesive.

- Waaaacky visuals! SS had those introductory title cards, Vol. 2 had the googly-eye voicechat filters as they were jumping through ""seven hundred"" portal things. Why did they show that three times? That whole sequence should either have been cut completely or given any actual consequences. ""Oh no, this isn't safe!"" [Safety risk is never mentioned again.] 

- LOUDLY YELLING THE OBJECTIVE THAT WE'RE ALL PRETTY AWARE OF: ""If we blast through the middle it'll kill him!"" is the new ""Her heart's out! We can end this!"" There's literally a cut to inside the ship for Quill to explain to the audience that if lazer go through brain of baddie then win.

- On that same note, characters blatantly spelling out their backstory/motivation. The original GotG was criminally guilty of this but Vol. 2 took it to the next level. Yondu did not need to sit Rocket down like a moody teenager and explain that they were JUST ALIKE. Yondu did not have to explicitly state that he was Quill's father figure. Let's not bother talking about the Sister Angst. Et cetera. 

- Soundtrack. I know that I'm going to get some hate for this one but I think that we can all agree that the soundtrack was both far weaker than GotG, and used way more literally. The song for thinking about fathers and sons was literally ""Father and Son."" And can we talk for a moment about Brandy (You're A Fine Girl)? I'm not super familiar with the song so them playing it while quoting it AND spelling out the metaphor TWICE was just a muddled attempt at spoon-fed exposition.

- Okay it's not a parallel to SS but they use three different end credit styles, none of which had any cohesion with the others or within themselves! Why is ""I am Groot"" flitting around the credits? Why are they dancing? Why are some of them not dancing, but moving around like paper cutouts? Is this in character or is this ironic? Why are there CG planets on this vintage cassette tape paper texture?

Overall, sure, it was fun. I'd gladly watch an entire movie that was just Yondu doing crazy stuff with the red murder arrow. I loved the celestial thing (although, another gripe, why give Peter these badass fantastic powers only to immediately take them away?! I want to see him having to learn how to deal with light powers. Augh.) I'm glad I saw it in theaters, and also glad that I paid matinee price for it.

EDIT: My husband brings up an incredibly relevant point: David Hasselhoff exists in the MCU, but Kurt Russell does not. He was in enough big films in the 80's-90's that Peter would totally know who he was.",69by9z
dh5vr4c,"I thought it was somewhere between meh and ok.  
My main gripe was that the action felt so empty, it made it boring. When the stakes are so high that losing is nowhere close being an option then I have no reason to be emotionally invested and at this point I find the MCU's CGIfests more tiresome than exciting.  
As for the humor, I loved the bits with Drax and Mantis but a lot of the other jokes were hit and miss for me.

Had the standard Marvel problems - weak third act, extremely weak and forgettable villain, and some unnecessary/nonsensical plot-lines.

I'm certainly starting to feel the superhero fatigue, but regardless I'm excited to see how the Guardians fit into the Infinity War films.

dhf2vax,"Some of my issues with the movie...

1. The CGI was overkill. After awhile, all of the stuff flying around the screen becomes hard to track and just gives you a headache. This was one of the reasons that movies like The Force Awakens desired to return to practical effects. 

2. The CGI stunts were also overkill and ruined any sense of danger for the characters. When there is all of this crap flying around the screen and the main characters are running, fighting, jumping and not getting a scratch on them, after awhile it ruins the suspension of disbelief that these movies require. It’s like watching someone play a video game where they can’t die or watching an old episode of the A-Team where there are a million bullets flying 
around but nobody gets shot. 

3. Ego’s flashback museum with the plasticine looking representations of him and his many alien wives looked silly. It looked like a cheap plastic model of a 1970s era Kurt Russel kissing alien 
women who also looked like they came out of a TV show from the 70s or 80s. He is essentially a 
GOD who can create life. Is a photograph or holograph that looks more realistic so hard for him?
How about even a halfway decent looking statue, if that’s what he was going for? While we are on the 
subject. Ego’s spacecraft looks like it came from the old Mork and Mindy TV show!

4. Did we really need the Pac Man gag? It was more than ridiculous to think that Peter Quill mastered
his newfound powers in the short time he had in order to manipulate matter to that extent. Was the joke really that funny or necessary? It made the movie look even more like a cartoon. 

5. Ego was not a menacing villain. They added the exposition about what happened to his children to turn him into a villain but there was no sense of menace or danger from Russel’s performance or in the character’s scenes where he interacted with the other characters. I felt they handled his transformation from a friendly father figure to the movie’s villain in a ham fisted and rushed way, probably because they had to make room for more CGI battles and Pac Man gags. 

6. Drax was basically reduced to comic relief. He was there to act as the punch line to the same 
joke they kept repeating over and over again. He says everything and understands everything literally. It was funny the first 5 or so times in the first movie. It’s becoming tedious when that’s now
basically all he does. In the first movie, he had the emotional weight of wanting to avenge his 
family, now he’s just a punch line. 

7. Did we really need another Chris Pratt shirtless scene to show everyone how hard he’s been working 
out? Wasn’t that obvious from the skintight t-shirt they had him wear? If they did the same with a female 
character, people would be screaming about the gratuitous of it. 

8. Are we supposed to buy into Rondu as a father figure when he nearly killed Peter Quill in the first movie
with his flying arrow after they captured him from floating in space? Are we supposed to just forget the fact that he spent years abducting countless children and delivering them to Ego, someone he regarded with contempt by his own admission?

9. I have to laugh when I see “Vin Diesel” in the credits and think about how much they must have paid him 
to just say “I am groot” like he was sucking helium. Yeah, I read the interviews where there is apparently 
“nuance” to his “voice acting” but they could have hired a stagehand to do the exact same thing and I seriously 
doubt the audience would know the difference. 

10. Why did Ego tell Peter he killed his mother? I understand how it serves the plot and moves the story along but there is literally no reason for Ego to say it other than lazy writing. It would have been better if Peter found out by accident or perhaps from the empath girl but this was just ridiculous to have him blurt it out as an aside when he knows how close Peter was to his mother.

Drax had no other role than comic relief and it wasn't even that funny. I laughed a couple times, but I felt like too many of the funny scenes were them trying to hard. The first one felt a lot more naturally funny.  
A lot of the songs felt like they were forced in, as opposed to the first one.   
Mothly or whatever Ego's pet was named idk if it was bad acting but I cringed every time she was on screen. And her interaction with Drax's was cringeworthy.   
As soon as Ego was introduced as Peter's dad you knew that he was going to be evil, since that's how it works in every single movie/tv show/book. I was just waiting for the shoe to drop. They even tried to make him look too good for it to be the case.   
Rocket was just an asshole and not even a funny asshole.   
When they said ""Groot is too adorable to kill"" I don't think I've rolled my eyes so hard in a film in a long time. We all knew Grout is there for the cuteness factor, there was no need for that obvious pandering comment.   
The fight scenes weren't even that exiciting.

It's still has the humor (which isn't as strong as the first) and action (which is better than the first imo) and it's cutesy moments...but there really isn't a central plot at all until the last act when the threat kicks in. This is a blessing and a bit of a detriment. I think if Gunn got rid of the Sovereign altogether and set the family narrative in motion sooner the film would flow better. 

This is basically an indie movie with a massive budget. The characters still work, the humor (mostly) still works, the visuals are absolutely stunning, the action is fun and it feels of it's director...which is something most MCU films lack imo. So like I said, Gunn is the MCU auteur. These films feel like more than just cogs in a machine building to just a bigger and louder installment. And for that, I have to tip my hat.

Summary: GoftG V.2 is less streamlined than the first with too much reliance on humor but it is overall a worthy sequel. ",69by9z
dhkkdph,"This movie was fun, there was one large problem i had though. Drax was legit useless. he did nothing, he's billed as this super warrior but in reality he did nothing. Why not have him kill that beast at the beginning? This would have at least given him some amount of validation as a bad ass. The rest of the movie doesn't really call for his skills so that's fine, but having be essentially less uselfull than baby groot was kinda dumb imo.",69by9z

dh5oi6e,"I found to be the pinnacle of mediocrity. A lot of sex and toilet humor (which to me is cringeworthy), a lot of on the nose storytelling with Peter not having a father figure, really bland antagonists, forced conflict between our heroes for the sake of 'drama', the pacing was jumpy, it tried to be a bit too 'edgy' and I'm going to say it, Groot being as inept as he was was annoying. The action was of course fine and the soundtrack was still excellent, but to be honest this movie feels pretty flat, especially compared to the first one. 5/10",69by9z

Edit: oh I see the fanboys have struck. This guy isn't giving a Marvel movie unrelenting praise! Downvote him!!!",69by9z
dh5p5so,"They dragged it on for too long, lost interest ",69by9z
dh6rb96,"I'll be downvoted by fanboys but it was just boring like almost every other big action movie. I felt so bored by so much spectacle, it felt like it just washed over me. The characters never appear in danger, everyone can do incredible things seemingly out of nowhere, the whole thing just... just washed over me. 

Captain America taking guys out with his shield on a boat was cooler than any action scene in this movie. Remember when iron man busted out of the cave prison in a movie with 1/5 the budget? Yeah way more exciting than seeing a red arrow seemingly able to kill 100s of people with ease. Where the tension?

Why do we need SO MUCH stuff, all these films are dialed too 11 nonstop and I don't understand how that's fun. The humor was more too, instead of subtle jokes and a quip here and there it's dialed up nonstop, why do we need Peter asking every character for tape... I must be a grumpy only man but I have his problem with most modern movies.

It's why the car chase of Steve McQueen in Bullit is better than lot of stuff in fast and furious, sometimes less is MORE. 

There's a clear difference when you compare this to Fury Road in terms of directors, that movie is on overdrive from the get go but it felt thrilling and you felt danger for the characters. This just was a video game. Fury road is like an exception to all the rules because it was made by a master at the peak of of his game, imho. 

Again not saying it's horrible. It was just Ok. But I felt the best parts were the non-joking quiet time between characters, wish we had more of those.

Not really. It gets points for trying to be different.

I really like these guys though, their team-dynamic and humour is great, they just need a more interesting story and antagonist for Vol. 3 ",69by9z

dh6hubu,"As a fan of the first one, I thought this one was actually quite bad.

Enough has been said about the humor, which felt scripted while the original had this on-the-fly, anything goes wit.

The action was also lacking and the entire third act turns into CGI nonsense (Ego's tentacle whips).  I thought the CGI for most part was also somewhat poor.

And I know a bunch of people said they felt emotion at the end of it, but when the characters are separated from each other for most of the film's running time, I had no investment and that ending wasn't earned.

Just my $.02.",69by9z
dh898ta,"Too much forced humor.

dh5rwqq,"I overall loved it, but I do have one criticism, which is that the big fight between Peter and Ego lapsed into generic boring mega-destruction superhero fare. I loved GotG for the banter, wit and humanity of it. If I wanted to see two guys punch each other through walls, I'd watch something like Man of Steel.

Again, other than that, it was great, but that just felt kinda lazy.

Drax stole the show again, though. ",69by9z
dhlj8z4,"I enjoyed the first film far more than this one. I think there were too many dull or slow moments in this sequel. The pacing just seemed off to me to the point where I would be disinterested and wanting for the next scene to begin, especially once they got to Ego's planet. My opinion is that the first film seemed to have a perfect flow to it where each subsequent scene made sense and followed along with the main story/plot. This one had the equivalent of ""intermissions"" or ""half times"" where it seemed to sit and wait for some event to happen. An example of this is how Gamora and Drax are basically sitting around doing nothing while Peter spends time with dad and the pace only picks up and starts moving again once Gamora randomly finds that cave of skulls. There were a few scenes where they really tried too hard to force a humorous line or action but don't mind these since they were kept to a minimum.

Some of the things I really enjoyed was any scene Drax and/or Yondu were in. I thought they made Rocket a bit too much of an asshole in some scenes but overall he was OK since I understand that's the angle they intentionally played him in. I also wish we got to see more of Stallone because he looked and sounded badass for the short screen time he had. I'm hoping they are saving his screen time for the third film.",69by9z

dh9pllq,"It was good, but only a little good. the pacing and tone where really all over the place for me and at times it was super jarring. Also for me it suffered from a lot of the humor either falling flat or going on too long, probably a result from the over saturation few baby Groot. Overall i had a fun time but felt very underwhelmed, i'd give it a solid 7/10...maybe a 7.5/10",69by9z
dhqejwm,"Saw it. I was a big fan of the first Guardians of the Galaxy, but the sequel didn't measure up. The pacing was waaaay too slow and there was way too much hugging and learning. Especially toward the end the scenes just dragged on and on and on. Also, family issues should be used sparingly as a theme in a comic book action flick, instead of slathering them all over the place like a chef trying to hide the blandness of his food with lots of hot sauce. 

Also, note to the director: after about the 10th time it happens, a miraculous escape from falling debris just doesn't seem so miraculous any more, y'know?

Gave it a six out of ten in the poll. Could have gone for a five. The first Guardians would have been a solid nine.",69by9z
dh65n2w,"After having a night to digest it, my primary reaction is disappointment. There was tons of stuff I liked and loved about this movie, but the bad overshadowed the good after I continue to think about.

They relied way too heavily on overused, played out cliches. I really disliked when Nebula, whose entire purpose was to kill her sister, had the opportunity to do so and of course her hand quivered. Replace that knife with a gun and you have a scene similar to dozens of movies. Worse to me was they kill Ego, the biggest super villain in the universe with a bomb with a timer? C'mon, that is such a played out movie trope. A TIMER? I can't get over that. Both of those are big time movie tropes and took me out of the movie completely given the unoriginality. These were really important scenes to the story they told and were written lazily. 

I swear the Golden Race got more screen time than Ego - the main villain. I also have a hard time accepting that he reigned supreme over the universe for millions of years, a literal deity, but died within a day of meeting Quill? For the back story they gave him, I thought he was such a weak villain with a weak purpose (like Ultron). 

Like I said, I enjoyed a lot of this movie but the negative is what sticks out to me the most. I think I'm so disappointed because I had such high expectations going in. I love the first one, it was such a surprisingly amazing movie, and I was so amped on the new one. I had the highest hopes in the world for Vol. 2 and it did not live up to the hype I'd created for myself which might be partially my own doing. ",69by9z
dh6m8o5,"This is the Age of Ultron to the Avengers. Forced humor detracting from serious moments, no real sense of tension and insane amount of exposition. Still a funny, decent movie, but pretty forgettable for me except for the ending. ",69by9z
dh8s299,"After really liking the first movie (8/10 for me). I think this movie is a serious disappointment (4/10).

The characters feel completely different to the first movie. 
Rocket has traded wit for just being an asshole.
Quill doesn't really make jokes he just references things.
Groot is cute and sometimes funny but mostly just useless.
I feel the only character who has maintained his charm is Drax who makes for some very enjoyable moments.
Yondu is cool as well (his arrow makes for the best scene in the movie imo) but I honestly didn't care enough about him to feel much emotion at his death.
The ensemble doesn't feel as sassy and overall the comedy is spread to thin making some scenes drag.

In terms of story I felt many of the character motivations and subplots were superfluous.
Ego wants to take over the universe because...
Gamora and her sisters relationship moves back and forth for seemingly no reason.
There were also some really cheesy moments like ""I control it with my heart...""

When it comes to filmmaking, the dialogue for the serious moments was a bit on the nose, with characters just saying there feelings rather then showing.
Some shots where cool but the whole CGI rock battle bored me and feel too similar to other superhero movies in terms of stakes.

I am really glad to see that so many people are enjoying this movie but I feel really disappointed. Would love to discuss with you guys.",69by9z
dh77rmy,"Didn't enjoy this one, cringed throughout the whole movie. The only thing I would rave about are the special effects.

Some things that made me really hate this movie:

- The whole celestial revelation, it's still hard for me to buy into that crap
- Chris Pratt's weak acting during serious and solemn moments
- The movie trying too hard to be funny
- The opening sequence
- The stupid plot
- The final battle

dh5vev1,"Ultimately pretty disappointing. It's bolder with thicker outlines, brighter colours and broader strokes. 

I was a little saddened to see that the film favoured comedy above all else, and with the way the group was split up it felt static for much of its running time. It spent too much time on reoccuring gags and punchlines, it made poor use of Batista. 

I enjoyed it, but I was hoping to entertained beyond just having a laugh. ",69by9z
dh5vz50,This should have been a lot better than it was.,69by9z
dh5zzqy,"Very disappointing. It felt like the movie was trying way too hard pretty much the entire time.  Drax wasn't used correctly and, I thought, very poorly done this time around.  The story was ok, but the characters I didn't care about at all. Except Yondu. They nailed him. The opening credits scene was great to. Definitely the part of the movie that most captured the magic of the first one. 

I understand that it was going to be nearly impossible to follow up the best Marvel movie to date, but this just wasn't very good. 

The music was also still great though. I look forward to adding the Awesome Mix Vol 2 to my music collection. ",69by9z

AND I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT",69by9z
dh5l76z,"Just got back from watching it! This movie was incredible, no doubt at all. As amazing as the first IMO. However it fell short in a couple areas.

I love groot as much as everyone, but he didn't need to be ""forced"" into every scene. I spent more time looking at groot then the rest of the cast and I feel thats not good.. 

One of my favorite things in any movie and especially about the first guardians of the galaxy, was that dramatic scene were peter lands and we get introduced to him, walking through the rain to his objective and when he gets inside, the sound is still quiet, he puts his headphones on, turns the music on and prepares and then BAM epic song, epic scene. Makes me so happy everytime I watch that.

My point is the music in this although yes it did mash with the storyline, just didn't make me excited like the first movie. I didn't recognise most of the songs this time which definitely didn't help.

One of the things that bothers me in movies is after we get this introduction to who the heroes are, they tend to fall away from that as sequels get made. Rocket was rocket, building shit that got the job done. Drax was Drax, Gamora fell a bit short, but I feel like she wasn't a well developed character in the first one either. 

The ending where Rocket is like, we only have one space suit and one rocket pack... come on now, thats a terrible reason to kill off a character. Yondu deserved better. I was hoping he was going to become part of the guardians.

I felt bored the entire way through. It wasn't giving me a reason to actually care about anything. Most of the jokes fell flat for me too. Which is odd because I adore James Gunn and his style of comedy.


I will praise it for the film's score and the production design. Those two things were out of this world.

I'd probably give this movie a 5 out of 10. I don't feel any reason to ever go back to it. Which sucks because the first is my favorite Marvel film. I'd give that maybe an 8.5 out of ten.

It just sucks to feel this way. I was so excited.",69by9z
dh6zpzx,"6/10: NO SPOILERS

If I felt the first one was overrated...

Most of the jokes fell flat. The funniest bit you've already seen. Otherwise solid family movie? Better pepper the already-awful script with words like ""dick,"" ""shit,"" ""asshole,"" and ""penis."" I'll never understand why they do this. The script could only have been improved if someone actually had to think of clever dialog and not have yet another character call someone a ""dick"" or an ""asshole."" I was just waiting for some character to break an intense scene with a loud fart because it would have matched the tone of the ""humor"" perfectly. I didn't hear anyone laughing in the theater, and certainly not as loudly and obnoxiously as the characters in the movie laugh at what we're apparently supposed to think is funny.

I don't get this riding the edge of being a goofy Technicolor cartoon of a comic book movie and then having everyone swear. At one point, Rocket translates an ""I am Groot"" statement and tacks on, ""Only he didn't say ""friggin.'"" Just drop the F-bomb at this point. You've already gone through the rest of Carlin's 7-words bit. Why stop now?

Every joke felt like a, ""See what we did there? Did you get that callback? Remember when we said that earlier in the movie and now we just said it again? Huh? You see? Get it? Aren't we funny? Aren't we so self-aware?"" That was drilled right into the ground. Oh, and please let's have another long, drawn on, slow motion shot of several characters assembling and looking cool. Never gets old.


The better parts of the movie include a more compelling plot than the first installment, character development, and taking an oddball Marvel villain and making it work as effectively as it did. I remember seeing a Cinema Sins video on YouTube that complained about some things in the first one that weren't really errors at all if they knew the comics, but that stuff gets explained for everyone else in this movie, which I guess you kind of need for parts of the first one to make sense. How could he hold an Infinity Stone? Why could he survive so long unprotected in space? Well, now you know.

It's also visually stunning. I only saw the 3D version because it had the more convenient showtime, but I'm actually glad we did.
They also try for some emotional pull. Like the jokes, it falls flat.


It's over 2 hours long and feels like it. I don't know if the editor called out sick or what, but every scene feels unnecessarily stretched out. This could've been pared down to a 90-minute flick easily and then they could release a director's cut for those diehard fans who couldn't possibly sit through enough slow-motion ""look how awesome I am"" pose fests.


Overall, this movie is like what a little kid does when you find something they do cute or funny: they do it a million more times a million times harder until it's neither cute nor funny anymore.",69by9z
dh87lda,"Seriously, I can't be the only one who thought this movie was extremely mediocre. The story is disjointed, Karen Gillan over-acted, and Drax was insufferable.

Not that it was bad, and I can't really put my finger on why, but I think it just lacked that special something that the first one had. There were a lot of things in it that I liked, but I feel like they didn't really add up as well as I thought they could have.

I don't think this is even my biggest complaint, but the biggest one I can actually convey in words is how they pulled the whole ""surprise villain"" thing. It didn't even actually surprise me, but I honestly can't tell if it was actually properly hinted at, or if that trope is just so overused these days that I'm starting to subconsciously expect it in everything, foreshadowing or otherwise.",69by9z
dh84n7u,"Metacritic rating is rather low, I think they are comparing it to the first a little too closely. Making a sequel isnt going to have the same feeling of drawing you to the characters because they are already established. I think it did a good job of keeping them true to themselves while providing them all a developing story arc that tied in with the rest of the movie. 

The sound track also was not as good as the first one

[I like that the scene at the begining led to the rest of the movie but wasn't abandoned when it had served its purpose.](#spoiler) 

You can tell it was a very well put together/directed movie because when you walked out of the theater it didn't feel like 2+ hours had passed. 

8.8/10 - Lots of funny one liners, a decent number of Cameos. Will buy when it comes out, probably wont see again in theaters",69by9z
dhav1ll,"It was good. The first one was better, but that's a pretty high bar to meet. Graded on its own merits, I give it a 7.5/10. 

I liked the Ego character. The Ego plot went off the rails a bit, but not so much to piss me off about it. His plan seemed a little unworthy of a small g god. 

Overall, the movie felt a little uneven. It could have been tightened up a little more in editing. Maybe lose a few of the one liners that didn't land. Really just cutting a shot here or there to cut it down maybe five minutes could have made a world of difference. 

There was a lot to like in the movie. Like I said at the top, it was good. It just didn't meet the high standard set by vol 1.

The paradigm is always the same when a protagonist meets a ""greater power,"" whether it be gods, or aliens, or robots. God cares not for the quibbles of man, and in his arrogance, man defies god. I don't know much about Marvel comic lore, but there *has* to have been something more interesting to do with a *god* that doesn't involve killing him off in the same movie in which he is introduced. 

Ultimately I'm not as enamored as others seem to be. A lot of the script felt like it was beholden to the original. It felt like it's intent was ""recapture"" rather than make a new movie. ",69by9z
dh5qa14,"Quite... disappointed. GOTG 1 was easily one of my favorites the year it came out. This sequel... not so much. Sigh.

Gunn attempts to focus on character development in his sequel, but it falls flat for me. Most of it felt quite forced. Yondu's Ravager past came out of nowhere, and though Gunn spends time on it, when it came to the payoff at the end, I felt nothing. His scene with Rocket just felt completely forced. The Nebula-Gamora interactions were okay on Gamora's part, but Nebula overacted every scene - and in the end, felt forced. The dialogue was just poor, and clearly directed at exposing character pasts in an unnatural way. It took me out of the mode. Instead of seeing 2 characters interacting, all I could see was expositional dialogue. Ego was just a poorly developed villain. ""Aha, I'm evil!"" ""Oh no! Now we must kill him!"" - ugh.

The Sovereign were quite useless.

Groot was hilarious, and incredibly cute. I liked a few of the songs. Humour was on point as usual. Action sequences and visual effects with CG were stunning.",69by9z

dhiwygk,"I enjoyed it for the most part but there are some things I didn't like

-I thought that Drax's laugh was way too obnoxious. It may just be me. I found some of the jokes funny, but others where he laughed I just kinda sat there. :/

-Rocket was just a dick to everyone. Idk if that's how he is in the comics, but it just wasn't enjoyable to watch him be a douche for the hell of it.

-I hated the Stan Lee cameo. Even more forced than usual.

-The fact there were 5 after credits scenes. Chill gotg. We only need one


-Finally I just want to say. The gold people (didn't pay attention to their name) are dumb. Their ship design is moronic when you think about it considering there's no real pilots. Why would you not make them just, like, flying guns? The only reason that ships are built like that is to house passengers, so why would you just make it more vulnerable if it doesn't have them? This was just something that I didn't really notice during the movie but looking back was like, ""Huh, that's pretty stupid.""

Things I liked

-Very funny. As I said, some of Drax's jokes are not great, but other than that I enjoyed most of the humor in the film. [I really liked when Groot was getting stuff for Yondu and Rocket and their exchange about hats xD.](#spoiler) or the main joke in the final fight.

-I loved that it was (for the most part) a lot more light-hearted than the rest of the MCU. I enjoyed that it didn't take itself too seriously. A perfect example is the joke in the final fight. It takes you off guard which was why it was hilarious, but I think that it worked.

-It made you feel when it wanted you to feel. Even with the jokes and comedy, there were still a lot of emotional moments. I really liked how Nebula and Yondu developed over the course of the film. [Nebula just wanted a sister, but was treated with a cold shoulder](#spoiler) It was really sad. Not to mention [Yondu's death. I thought I was done feeling when he was released into space, but they hit you again](#spoiler).

-And the fact that it wasn't a main baddy in the MCU was really refreshing. It felt like a side quest (in a good way). Even though the stakes were as high as before, I think the fact that [no one lived on Ego](#spoiler) made it feel like there wasn't.
",69by9z
dhaacmr,"I liked some parts of this film, and strongly disliked others (overall I'd give it a C or C+).

The visuals looked pretty good.  I liked the set design, the worlds, and the alien races.  Some scenes were very striking (certainly the whole sequence where [Yondo and Rocket escape and kill the mutineers](#spoiler) was phenomenal).  I also quite like The Sovereign as a race, their whole schtick was pretty clever IMO and made for some great comedic moments.

But pretty much any part of the movie touched by the main story line went downhill.  Ego [was obviously a villain from the moment he came on screen and for me the only question was how is Peter going to find out](#spoiler).  I thought the choice to have [Ego kill Peter's mother](#spoiler) weakened the whole storyline and even undercut the theme of the movie.  [If I could rewrite things I would have had Ego try and make Peter kill his friends or something, causing him to buck th mind control](#spoiler).  At least that would have gotten at the main theme a little more, rather than just further rehashing and rewriting his backstory.

I also disliked the [romance between Peter and Gamora](#spoiler).  It felt slightly forced in the last film too (like they just threw it in because [every hero needs a girl to get, or something](#spoiler), rather than because it organically formed), and then in this one it just felt cringey every time it was on screen.

Finally they crammed ""zany gags"" in a few too many times (the giant PacMan thing for example), that sort of undercut any drama they were trying to build.  I know the film is a comedy, but it felt like they were trying too hard and forcing a good number of them, rather than going with the rhythm of the film.

Ultimately I think this movie suffered because of its format.  It would almost be better to have it as a miniseries with lots of ""smaller"" adventures, rather than the one big one at the center.  I feel like the writers were half trying to go for a ""Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" vibe sometimes, and that's something that would come out better across six, hour long episodes, rather than all crammed in together and loosely held in place by a weak central plot line.  

Also a small effects quibble: in that scene where [Yondo is dying](#spoiler) the green screen was crappy.  It looked like they were spooning or something and then some intern with a MacBook had edited in a NASA photo of the day behind them.  It just bugged me, given the rest of the movie.

tl;dr: had some good laughs, liked the set design, but overall a lot of the main plot was obvious, cliched, and poorly written, which dragged down the quality of the remaining side plots and character development (which otherwise would have been quite good I think).  Overall the sequel is worse than the original.

Edit: Looking back I think the movie that I really wanted to see was the same side plots but centered on Rocket Racoon.  Maybe he discovers some part of his past and chases after it or something, and that's what pulls the whole group apart.  His character arc was pretty compelling to me, and I think it needed a little more room to breathe and  something concrete to tie it together, so a person coming back from his past to symbolize the conflict he was feeling would have been, IMO, great and would have still left a lot of room (maybe even more room)  for a lot of the other stuff that they did.  Thy could even focused more on the [Yondo/Starlord](#spoiler) relationship which to me get underused in the actual plot line.  I think the whole thing with [Starlord](#spoiler) felt cheaper and constrained what could be done with the rest of the movie.",69by9z

dhcb1x7,"Probably going to be some disagreement on this, but I think the ending would have carried much more emotional weight if Drax had died instead of Yondu. Drax's literal humor was running dry for my taste by the end and Yondu was being set up with more backstory, not to mention his whistle and arrow weapon is much more visually impressive than Drax's fighting. I get that there was a sub-theme of Yondu being Starlord's ""real"" father who's died instead of Ego, plus they're setting up a relationship with Drax and that starry-eyed antenna chick, but swapping out Drax for Yondu in the ending deaths scene would have given this films ending the impact it needed in my opinion, especially since the first ended with Groots sacrifice.",69by9z

dh6s1qn,"I'm not surprised by the generally positive reaction, but I really think this is the first objectively bad MCU movie. Everything was overdone to the point of the movie just being scene after scene of gobbledygook.

So you like the action scenes and montages with dated music playing over them? Here's 15 of those.

You like wacky aliens? Here's a bazillion of those.

You like the Baby Groot? Here's several pointless scenes in which he's the centerpiece.

You like Drax and his hyperliteral personality? Let's dial that up 900%.

Snappy dialogue and bright colors? Oh you bet. That's the entire fuckin movie. It's a collage of flashy shit instead of an actual story.

Basically it takes everything the MCU does wrong and doubles down on it- weak villain, blue laser in the sky, stakes free action scenes, stretching the suspension of disbelief to its breaking point, too many winks at the camera (one character literally does this multiple times), ham fisted character arcs, overeliance on pop culture bullshit, and throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks.

dh5eps1,"This movie was a real mixed bag for me.

A lot of the dialogue and comedy was very good, I think Groot was the highlight just because it required a little more creativity in how they portrayed the character. But a lot of the comedy was very forced particularly the pacman thing towards the very end. Overall I'd say the tone in this movie felt off as though they wanted the fights to be a mix of fun and amusing but didn't really execute properly.

The visuals were another thing that were jarring as hell, there were parts where the CGI was spot on basically what you expect but there are a couple of parts that really stick out as having awful visuals. [Like when gamora splits that beast open in the beginning](#spoiler)

As for the plot it didn't have the same charm as the original, it just felt predictable overall, and while I appreciate what they were going for with [Yondu being Quill's real father-figure](#spoiler) it just felt like those characters hadn't been developed enough for me to particularly care.

I really expected more... story or something. It felt like nearly nothing happened but jokes and overly dramatic emotional scenes. They fight some dimensional thing during the intro and then run away and find his dad. He unleashes some glowing blue shit(its a comic book movie) and then finale. The fights have zero impact because its either supposed to be funny or its just cgi clusters.

Then those awful emotional scenes to get the audience to feel bad for everyone... All I wanted was a sister. We're so alike because deep down we hide our true feelings. I'm so mad at you Gamora because hes my real dad. You were my real dad all along. yada yada yada.

- There was a shit ton of jokes, but not a lot landed for me. Some of it reminded of Gunn's Scooby-Doo movies. Quite a lot of toilet humour to my surprise. Didn't like it.

- I didn't like that Drax turnded into one-liner spewing caricature of what he was in the first movie.

- Karen Gillan is horrible as Nebula in this movies. Why is she overacts so much?

dh5ef7a,"A very enjoyable movie, but not as great as the first. My gripes:

1. Most of the humor works, but some is very self-indulgent. The penis riff between Ego/Drax was so unnatural.

2. Nebula. I will never be able to buy into this character. Whether its her use in the plot or the actress' acting, this character is a dud. Does anyone actually enjoy her?

3. I am 100% convinced Mantis only use in this film was to externalize Drax's inner-pain when discussing his daughter. Literally thats it. An incredibly pointless addition.

4. The action was a major downgrade in this film. I don't think Drax threw one punch this movie. I'm serious. Can someone double check me on that? And the spaceship battles can only be interesting for so long. I really loved the hand-to-hand combat in the first and the lack of that in the second is very noticeable.

5. The family motif in this film was WAY too apparent. I mean, obviously, when the plot revolves around Peter finding his father - but other than that: Nebula/Gamora (ugh), Kraglin/Yondu, Rocket/Yondu, Yondu/Peter.. it was all far too obvious. You knew Yondu was going to sacrifice himself for his 'boy' Peter thirty minutes into the film.

The film is very enjoyable overall. It just didn't feel as special as the original. There are some fantastic emotional beats, some great humor, and fantastic visuals. But the flaws in this film are so much more noticeable than they are in the first. Still, always enjoy a go with the Guardians of the Galaxy.",69by9z

-Good emotional moments, but they seemed out of place in a movie that adopted the Deadpool humor method (throw a shitload of jokes out on the screen and see what sticks). 

-Boring action scenes, just like the first. 

-Yondu was the best part of the movie and the only character that didn't seem like an exaggerated version of himself (everyone else felt like walking quip machines that occasionally said something sad). 

-The relationship between Peter and his dad wasn't developed enough to make his betrayal feel emotionally resonant (Kurt Russell overall was underutilized). 

-Sylvester Stallone was a complete waste. They did absolutely nothing interesting with him. 

-The end sequence with Yondu's funeral was excellent, probably the best ending to an MCU movie. 

-The movie just felt utterly disjointed to me, kind of like this post.

As well, a few of the jokes they were going for didn't quite land with me, but there were a few lines that *killed* me, that I thought were so hilarious, my friends and I were literally doubled over in laughter, and nobody else in our theatre even reacted. Nobody there seemed to be having any fun, it was the strangest thing ever.

Yondu definitely stole the show. His whistle bow was amazing eye candy. Drax was hilarious this time around, and we got a much more grounded and family-based story.

The only thing about this one is there's no clear cut bad guy, or a lack of development of a bad guy. Peters dad towards the end where he drops the I gave your mom the tumor line was really anti climatic because you knew it was coming. It was like a forced WWE heel turn. I guess there was too much lead up to revealing him as the villian as soon as Manthis wanted to spill the beans to Drax.

A lot of character development for the guardians too, which is great if you're really into MCU films. I think this is a movie where you really have to watch the 1st one to understand. But one thing I do love about Marvel is that they don't try to reintroduce the same characters.",69by9z

The second movie came around and I was so pumped up for it after the first. It did disappoint me only because it did feel slower. The movie really did a great job with the story, and the humor was crazy good (though maybe they played around with Groot humor a little too much only because they knew it would help rating, I mean they just made him so cute).

The jokes are funny - this is a property no other marvel movies were able to achieve.

The characters are thought through. And the main emotion drivers have been enthusiastically utilized: relationships between family members (father-son, siblings), active acts of empathy (it touches, when someone else feels someone else's strong feelings), heroic death, social acceptance, inception of romantic feelings, and communication reflexion. The writers did a perfect job.

My main disappointment is rather philosophical. The ""motivation of the bad guy"" part hasn't evolved a bit. They all want more power, which is not entertaining for me. I don't believe it. I can believe a human wants something like this. Though, it won't be satisfying either, too trivial. But celestial creature should have different values.

1 was more coherent, centralized around the 70s mix tape; whereas 2 feels scattered for the first half, even if it eventually ties back around.

a lot of the fun bits heavily featured in 2 were already introduced in 1, and the higher frequency only hurt their effectiveness.

character backstories are somewhat interesting, but (maybe aside from Nebula) were implied enough in 1 that they weren't worth the added screen time. For example, Yondu is suggested as a good guy at the end of 1 (even more clear if one knew his comic history), I'm not sure I needed a whole movie on the topic, with the same theme emphasized again and again (although done better than F&F).

I would recommend 1 to anybody, regardless of their experience/preference of marvel movies. Can not be said of 2. (still better than avengers 2, Iron man 2,3 and both thor films)",69by9z

Okay, I have an unpopular opinion...I thought Guardians 1 was just okay. It was a 6/10 for me. That being said...I think that was the best comicbook movie I've ever seen. I don't mean it was the best movie with comic characters (that would be The Dark Knight or something) but I honestly can't think of a movie that has made me feel more like I'm seeing a comic universe on screen. It was the casualness that really did it for me. The way Howard The Duck was just sitting around, the way The Watchers were barely shown, etc. This movie did all that perfectly!
As far as the storyline, I really liked it. I expected to hate Baby Groot but he stole every scene he was in for me. I loved that pretty much every character got development, which is really difficult when you have 5 main members and you pretty much add 2 more. I was holding back tears for most of the final act and Yondu's funeral definitely almost got me.


It's funny, there were two parts that made me physically point at the screen in excitement (which was weird since I went by myself lol) and they got no reaction from my crowd. I expected at least one person to care about the Stan Lee = Watcher thing but no one did and the same with Adam Warlock. Honestly, I was kicking myself as I walked out because, every time they showed the Sovereign people, I knew they would be important so I tried to think of who had all gold skin in the comics. I think the reason Adam didn't occur to me was because people thought his cocoon was in GOTG 1 (Or at least that's what I'm going to tell myself).

I didn't like Drax. At all. I thought he was such an amazing character in 1 so it was sad for me to see what he turned into.

I really would've liked if they had focused more on Rocket's story. I felt like they threw it in at the last minute because they realized they hadn't given him anything to do. And it would've been nice to have more time with Yondu.

Still not a fan of the Peter and Gamorra relationship, but can't decide if that's because I think they don't seem right for each other, or because I'd like there to be at least one movie where the protagonist doesn't have a designated love interest.

Where the hell did that shit between Gamorra and Nebula come from?! Would've been nice to have a bit more insight on that, but that would mean we'd miss out on Drax talking about his sensitive nipples or laughing like hyena at every little fucking thing, and we can't have that now can we?

Yondu and Rocket's big action scene was absolute perfection. I wouldn't change one single thing about it. Maybe cut back on ""the Groot can't understand what they're talking about"" bit and give Yondu and Rocket more time together (so Yondu's insight into Rocket makes a little more sense), but that's pre-Big-Damn-Heroes moment, the action scene itself is everything that is great about both movies.",69by9z

But you shouldn't be celebrating the death of a fucking murderous thief with his band of other murderous thieves. Fuck imagine if you adoptive dad was the leader of a Mexican cartel that brutalized innocent people, killed people, stole people's livelyhoods, but in the end your dad saves you from another crook before dying.

For fucking Nebula who uses the excuse of having an abusive childhood as if it makes up for her trying to help her dad commit space genocide.

Barely a plot. Interesting villian, but please explain again why he had to kill Peter's mother? He had Peter! Out of nowhere he decided to tell him he killed her, the ONE thing that could have snapped him out of it. The final fight was visually great but 90% superpowered dudes clashing into each other, which gets boring really fast.  (Oh, and Chekov's Gun much? ;) )

When I'm going out to see a Guardians movie, I expect fun and wacky characters, but this time EVERYONE is a comic relief. No one is there to contrast them, therefore devalueing the humor. The only one was Drax contrasting himself, amplified through Mantis.

Everyone is constantly telling us what exactly they think and feel. I know this is getting more common nowadays, but this time it was really on the nose. What happened to ""show, don't tell""?",69by9z

I loled at cropduster scene, i loved the reverse Cliffhanger plot, i enjoyed Sly being badass, i loved to see Kurt-well at least some of that-  . I really did not like what they did to Groot and Rocket, gold people was cringe and boring as fuck sadly, i really hated forced humor that is going on in this one too like Doctor Strange.

Overall, it was OK. I wish they did not over saturate themself like that tho.

dhjx16c,"This movie was really a mixed bag.

Great stuff:

* The opening two sequences 

* Color in a marvel movie???

* The de-aging effect

* The ridiculous dairy Queen product placement.

* Pretty much everything involving Ego or Yondu

* Some stakes toward the end of the movie

* Holy shit, Quill is a god?

* Holy shit, he threw it all away?

* Drax on dancers and non dancers

* Is Ego the best MCU villain (along with Loki)?

* ""I'm Mary Poppins y'all""—funny and meaningful at the same time

* ""Good for theivin'""

* Quill immediately shooting Ego—what a guy

* Yondu's death was one of the best things in the MCU

The hilarious:

* ""I'm gonna make some weird shit""

* That rolling carpet

* The tape sequence

* the skin thing

* The drawer filled with arms

* Stupid thieves

The bad:

* forced family theming

* Characters going into God-mode. Drax can't get hurt. Gamora can pick up the gun that's like twice her weight

* Wonky pacing

* zero stakes first two acts

* I was able to tolerate Rocket in the first movie, but he's so annoying in this one

* Everything between Quill and Gamora felt shoehorned

* The whole Nebula subplot. It's all over the place

* The fact that a whole alien race is there as a joke

* Exposition dumps galore

* Final fight scene was so over the top, it seemed like a light show, not a climax

* these credits sequences are getting excessive

The painful:

* Nipple jokes

* Poop jokes

* Characters acting like children

* Ultra predictable music that fades away every time someone is going to tell a ""joke"" and then fades back in

* 700 jumps

* ""Except he didn't use frickin""

* ""Gotta take a whiz""

* Baby Groot doesn't find the fin for 5 minutes

* Taserface... *Cue rocket laughing like an idiot*

* Every time Drax refers to ideas from other cultures, all the characters dismiss him (his parents conceiving him, Ego's penis)

* When Peter and Gamora dance

* The mantis is ugly running joke

I felt like I was watching a bad episode of Family Guy at times. The two greatest offenders in my opinion is the ""Taser Face"" scene, and the tape conversation. Neither of those were funny, and both only exist to meet a comic relief quota rather than to actually make anyone laugh.

dhn86gl,"I enjoyed the first movie, but I hated this one. I was completely bored from the opening credits, and halfway through I just wanted it to end. The jokes were not funny like most of the jokes in the first film. They tried far too hard to shove jokes into the dialogue almost every 30 seconds and it felt disingenuous. The loud, bombastic, lightspeed pace was too much. There was so much CGI in every shot I felt I was watching a cartoon. They milked baby groot as much as they possibly could and pandered the cuteness factor to the audience so much that it felt like a cheap ploy by the filmmakers to lure in the audience. Which in turn made me not invested in the story or the characters at all. As I was watching this, I felt like had had deja vu - like I have seen this same movie 50 times before. It's just a formulaic copy of a copy of a copy. I am tired of these derivative, hollow marvel movies. Can we PLEASE let them die now? ",69by9z

dhkcgjp,"So I just saw this movie yesterday for my birthday and I have to say while it wasn't terrible, it wasn't great either, it was ok. I'd give it a 6/10 with the original being a 9. 

The things that bothered me was that there wasn't as great a sense of urgency as in the first film and that's understandable considering the focus on the theme of family. I felt the choice to split up the group was pointless and honestly, they could have tightened up the script a bit more by cutting at least thirty minutes. I love the marvel movies but they don't all need to clock in at over two hours.

While I appreciate that Ego wasn't exactly cookie cutter the execution of his real motivations was weak. Ultimately I think that the main problem with the movie is that it didn't keep a consistent theme and the middle really dragged. 

I also felt that Mantis and Nebula were underutilized and barely developed at all. Also, the music was overused and the movie felt as if it relied too much on its special effects rather than keeping a tight story. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the movie but for the third one, they really need to find better writers. I'd say this is about as good as Thor 2 or Iron Man 3 they're not bad movies by any means but they could use a lot of work.",69by9z

I could have used less. It was tonally all over the place IMO. Again, good movie, but not one I will see again in theaters.

dh5phmq,"Questions:  

How did Ego know where to find Peter in that save-the-day deus ex machina moment? And was that Ego manning the gun atop the ship as the ""tiny spaceman""?  


Why did Peter genuinely enjoy calling Rocket a Trash Panda? He was angry with Rocket for causing their predicament, sure, but he knows Rocket hurts being belittled down to basic animals, and seemed to have an out-of-character moment happily smirking that it was a worse insult.  


Why were half the Ravagers expelled into space? I don't remember half of them fighting back over Taserfaces takeover.  


So what happened to Ego's blue goo extension-of-himself seedlings on all those planets? Did they just go away? Are they still there? He needed Peter to help activate them, but they just stopped growing when they disconnected.  


If Yondu was actually such a kind soul why did he hand over the dozens of other children to Ego to die? He had to have guessed something was up long before Peter came along.  


Did I miss a plot point where something happened to help convince Gamora to be more lenient / sympathetic toward Nebula? She had the chance to stop her / kill her in a cliche close-quarters-combat scene but didn't take the opportunity, instead opting for leniency. What gave her a last-second change of heart?  


Was it me or was Nebula dialed back from how angry and dangerous she was in the first film? She lets the Ravagers take her. She ""asks"" for a spaceship from Kraglin instead of just taking one.  


Who were those two grey figures fighting on the barren planets surface when Rocket and Yondu galaxy-hopped past?  


What was Mantis's connection with Ego? He kept her around to soothe him / lull him to sleep? Even though she could stall his planetary core attack but still keep them flying in a space pod he materialized during consciousness? Was she one of his ""failed"" children he was disposing of?  


How did the Sovereign know to look within Ego's core to find and attack the Guardians?  


How did Baby Groot just get over his learning disability and hit the right buttons on the bomb? Same with him standing up to the ravagers - he couldn't put up a fight with them, but then he was able to extend his roots and kill one on the walkway above?  


I thought the Celestials were supposed to be humongous planet-sized beings like the one turned into the Knowhere mining colony, but Ego's brain was the size of a small building.  


Why were all the sets circular? The Obelisk Portal, The Sovereign Throne Room, Ego's Throne . . .


Where was Glenn Close? She was credited but I did not spot her.",69by9z
dh5qb1c,The tossing ball scene was perhaps one of the cringiest cinema moments I've seen in a while. A lot of people behind me in the theatre (UK) were audible muttering about it when the scene was happening.,69by9z
dh5jxa3,"Of late, I've had trouble finding the context within which to judge Marvel movies - do I view them as stand-alone films, surely not, because they are sequels; but they aren't just sequels, they are side projects from a sequel, which itself is a sequel to a side project. Further compounding this obscured background is an unclear genre - Marvel movies are action and adventure with some comedy and romance, and a pinch of drama. They never take themselves too seriously; but nor do they challenge us, our ideas, or beliefs. 

I've felt for a while that Marvel might be ""playing it too safe"" with their movies and when you add in a perpetual promise of more and more sequels, problems start to emerge. Character development, plot development, central conflicts, etc. feel lessened because of the context of the larger universe - that changes can only be slight, or resolutions fleeting because they have to be ready for the *next* movie.

To come back to GotG2 for an example, Peter and Gamora have a conversation on a balcony regarding their ""unspoken thing"" - it moves their relationship forward, but only just, and it never reaches a resolution. This movie (and MCU movies in general) feels like watching an infomercial, with Billy Mays shouting ""But wait, there's more!""

Let me put it another way: within the context of the MCU, the structure and conflict of this movie (and other MCU films) is *weakened* by the overarching (but still vague) conflict of Thanos which overshadows the conflict and diminishes the development within a single MCU movie. 

If it comes to be that Infinity Gauntlet *is* the climax to *all* the stories and characters we've seen so far - excellent - but there are MCU movies planned out for another 3 years, so I somehow doubt that everything will be wrapped up all nice and tight with that movie.

That brings me back to my main point: how does one judge a Marvel movie? Was it fun? 

Ironically, like my critique of this film, I'm only slightly closer to answering such a question. To give one last thought, the comic book movie industry is over 10 years old, and Marvel seems to have the formula for printing money within this industry pretty well figured out - but formulae don't leave much room for innovation, and if you aren't new, you may also soon be not entertaining.

There were times where I felt like the movie needed to breathe, but never stopped itself from doing that. Other than that it was everything a sequel should be, even if it didn't carry the same novelty punch as the first.

Not that multiple plot lines or a less streamlined structure are bad things, but neither seems quite appropriate for this type of movie nor is it executed in the best possible way. But it’s stilla very entertaining film with many jokes (some forced, some genuinely funny), great visuals and even some depth (there is quite a lot of emotion and groundwork for characterization, though it’s often hard to take it seriously given the nature of the movie). Dave Bautista steals the show as Drax and Rooker stands out as the actor most capable of pulling off drama.",69by9z
dh8fewy,"Just an ok movie. Not as good as the original because of a lot of problems. It feels like the movie sometimes is what it doesn't want to be. I feel like inside of here is a really good, dramatic movie but Marvel really wanted to stick with the tone of the first so a lot of forced jokes were inserted (the warped faces in hyperspace, for example).  
And even the dramatic part didn't have that extra punch that it needed. Yondu's death felt weightless without him spending a scene with Peter or the other Guardians besides Rocket. His death is drives this film at the end. Develop his role as a guardian and as a parent to Peter. Show--don't tell!  
The editing and pacing also felt really out of whack. There was a godawful cut when Quill asked Ego about why he let his mother die. We see Ego's reaction for a second, Peter's face for another second and then it cuts without a resolution until like 20 minutes later when the conversation continues.  
I would equate this movie to what Lucas' ESB would have been. He wanted to make ESB lighter but many people working on the film (Kirshner and Kurtz in specific) stopped him.

dh8dgk0,"Theory: Thanos, not Ego or The Sovereign, was the main villain of the movie

Ever since Thanos appeared at the end credits of The Avengers, Marvel fans have been waiting for him to begin his quest for universal take over. Much to our dismay, the last time we saw Thanos was in the Age of Ultron when he put on the infinity glove and said, ""Fine. I'll do it myself."" Even in the only film he appeared in before the credit scenes (Guardians of the Galaxy), he did not appear to do much of anything besides sitting on his throne. But what if he has already started his plan and begun his attack on Earth?

Although some of Marvel's villains' names have hinted at their purpose and goals in the films (Loki, Ronin, Thanos, etc.) none have been quite as obvious as the name Ego, the Latin pronoun that literally translates ""I"" and the greedy living planet who literally states that his goal is to make everything himself. What most people do not realize, however, is the role the word ""ego"" in Latin. If you wanted to say ""I am Groot"" in Latin (obviously I made up the word for Groot), you would say ""Sum Groot."" Notice, this does not contain the word ""ego"". ""Ego sum Groot"" would also translate ""I am Groot,"" with an extra emphasis placed on ""I"". The key part of the pronoun ""Ego"" is that it is totally unnecessary in Latin and makes no significant contribution to the meaning of the sentence. Marvel has been known to subtly hint at the contents of upcoming movies, and this much lesser known meaning of Ego could reveal key information about the upcoming MCU movies. 

So what if Ego, apart from providing two house of entertainment to fans, really was an ""unnecessary"" part of the universe, just like his name suggests? I believe that Ego, although he may not have realized it, was just another disposable pawn of Thanos who proved unnecessary in the long run. He merely served as a distraction. Ego's interactions with Quill ensured that Quill would lose his celestial powers while Ego himself was killed. This is quite fitting with Thanos' name as well. In Greek Mythology, Thanos and his fellow titans were defeated by Zeus and the Greek gods (Ego himself claims that he and Peter are gods with a little g). Getting rid of these powerful beings who could take him down would be the logical thing to do before an invasion of Earth. It also would not be all that surprising if Thanos had influenced the Sovereign to put the Guardians in a situation where they would have inevitably run into a Ego. These events distracted the Guardians from searching for the infinity stones and killing Thanos, which Drax has made clear is a priority. I am fairly certain that the giant blue earth consuming plant was fairly distracting for the Avengers on Earth and other potential powers, such as Xandar, that could oppose Thanos

Throughout the most recent MCU movies, the characters have faced very distracting enemies, who many fans have deemed disposable. Many fans have been disappointed in the lack of high-quality villains like Loki in recent movies. But perhaps Marvel has finally given us a clue as to why this has happened. If you think of the most recent villains (Ego, the Sovereign, Kaecilius, Dormammu, the Gamemaster from Ragnarok, Ronin, Zemo, and even Loki), you may realize that they have all stopped the hunt for the Infinity Stones, which began in the Avengers and was most clearly continued in The Dark World. Perhaps these ""unnecessary"" and excessively disposable characters, however, are part of a much larger universe we do not yet understand. Like Ego, these characters have been unconsciously used as pawns in Thanos' plan to take over Earth. Thanos, working on his plot to take over the universe, has been the true main villain in nearly every Marvel movie since Guardians of the Galaxy, even though he has only appeared briefly in three MCU movies so far",69by9z

dh5hot7,"I really liked it and absolutely recommend seeing it, but I had a couple problems with it:

1) I felt the movie didn't have as much drive in it's plots pace, I think the movie suffered from only having a main villain in the third act and no real pressure in the first two thirds. The third act absolutely makes up for it and the story can only really be told with the reveal starting the third act, but I just feel the first movie had better pacing in that regard.

2) The gold alien race didn't really need to be in the movie, they only seem to be there to introduce Adam for the threequel. 

I love the first movie and I really liked this one, but it's just not quite as good as the first in my eyes.",69by9z

dh5kvl4,"So I was a bit disappointed. I felt like a lot of scenes just dragged on for far too long with nothing happening. Also, the music was getting on my fucking nerves. The songs in the first movie were used far more sparingly and during times when Peter was actually listening to it himself. In Vol. 2 they just randomly play for no reason right in the middle and then abruptly just end and the actual orchestra kicks in and it's really jarring. Also, they crashed a ship into the bad guy in the first movie and then did if again hers. They really couldn't come up with another way to stop Ego? Anyway, I can watch the first GotG over and over again and not get tired of it yet I have no desire to see part 2 again. Sad really as Marvel is usually pretty damn good at making sequels. And did anyone else feel like Star Lord was barely in it? ",69by9z
dh5ldbk,"I was actually a bit disappointed. Not bad by any means, just meh. The first act was pretty good. The second was so slow. And the third was just non-stop fighting/action. Some of the jokes were a bit forced and didn't go over. Probably a 6 or 7.",69by9z
dh5qpqr,"Eh... on the whole, I enjoyed it far less than GotG1.  The first movie was so natural with its funny moments, but it felt like for the sequel they went ""Ok, remember all the funny bits from the first movie?  We're gonna do all of those, but about five of each/put them in weird places, kay?"".  The part in the opening with Baby Groot freezing when Drax looked at him - IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT SCENE - was a really obvious example of this.

I found the scene with Drax and Mantis first talking super dull as well.  It seems like Drax's character is purely there to ""Tell, don't Show"".  Whenever something funny happens, his job is to yell ""HA HA HA THAT IS A JOKE WHICH I FIND FUNNY"".  I know it's his character, I know that it makes sense for his character to do because he's a very straightforward guy with limited awareness of social cues etc, but IMO it would have been much funnier for him to just do the loud, raucous laughter as an example of his social separation rather than stating what the audience already knows.

They still didn't really give Drax much of a job, either.  A lot of my gripes are pretty Drax-oriented, but this isn't his character so much as how they use him.  In this first movie, his entire role was to act super cocky and then get his ass beat.  In this movie... exact same thing.  I can't even remember what he did for the latter half of the film because everyone else did all the cool stuff.   I want to see Drax actually get to do awesome things rather than just be the socially inept muscle that can get punched lots and makes stupid decisions.

I liked the twist.  I could see it coming after a little while, but Peter's reaction to it was awesome.  The Sovereign however were a bit meh, and don't really feel like they're as powerful as they're supposed to be.  I did, however, like how dark they went - the airlock scene was amazing, it really hammered home the threat and I enjoyed Rocket's reaction to it.

Overall, it was ok, but I preferred the first one.  Give Drax things to do in Infinity War other than get punched by Thanos plz.",69by9z
dh5v22d,"Here's my gripe with this movie, almost nothing happened. Think about it, if James decides to come back for a third one, why would we have to watch the second one? We lost and gained a character, that's really it. 

Others gripes for me, the comedy felt a little forced and the pacing was really up and down, cluttering useless story elements in it at times.

The CGI was also overused as is often the case in movies these days.
It was also badly used in some cases, like the mannequins in Ego's house and the part where he becomes this walking skeleton. 
It's like the filmakers looked at what made the first movie work and decided ""more is better"". It isn't.

Also starting to dislike the love subplot more and more, was really hoping they'd skip it after basically making fun of it in the first movie. 

Drax carried most of the movie, largely since he was the only one who got actual great lines. They seemed to forget they had Burt Macklin there to do comedy, he barely got any worthwhile comedy and got stuck just being the plot driver. Good thing Drax got pretty much every line to land to remind me this was a fun sci-fi movie at heart.",69by9z

The cinematography, pacing and character development were great – and the soundtrack! Michael Rooker stole the show – his gave depth to a seemingly shallow character with more emotion than Pratt or Russell. Although the main story here was about Quill and his father, Pratt's performance felt flat. 
Vol. 2 solidified the ""family"" dynamic of the franchise – which is why it's drawing parallels to Fast and the Furious. The characters seem a bit too indestructible, [which is why Yondu's death at the end was so important](#spoiler)

Even the character arcs are largely contrived, forced messes. Nebula's arc with Gonorrhea is honestly as terrible as Batman and Superman's in BvS. She goes from wanting to kill her sister to not wanting to kill her because... all she wanted was a sister? Who wrote this shit?

dh5ofrb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is a fun, entertaining ride about empathy, family, and humility. The film follows Star-Lord and his mercenary group as they escape intergalactic threats. A bit of Star-Lord's past is also explored through the introduction of his father, Ego the Living Planet. How does a planet procreate with a human-being? Don't worry, it would be explained in the film. Unlike the first film, which had external threats, the main conflict lies within the Guardians themselves. It is manifested externally in both Ego and the Sovereign, a group of prideful alien life that looks down on others. 

The overall story is narrated well and James Gunn reveals himself to be a fantastic writer and director. Each actor does a great job conveying his/her character. Michael Rooker stands out in this film and delivers a heartfelt performance as Yondu. The cinematography is good but the constant use of CGI makes the film feel weightless. 

No movie is without faults and Guardians Vol 2 has a few. For one, the movie's tone tends to shift between gritty and cartoonish. Most likely this was done to cater to a much younger audience that would increase ticket sales. Another fault is the film's length. Guardian Vol. 2's story could had been told 30 min less than the actual film's run-time. However, the jokes make up for this while keeping the audience awake. 

Overall, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2"" is a polished film that starts the summer right. James Gunn may not had delivered on the epicness of the first film but he told a personal story about relating to others. There are quite a few flaws including length time and a shifting tone. The acting, directing, and cinematography are done well. This film is a must see on the big screen with 3D.  

Notes

* Giant heads are the new ""beam in the sky""
* The make-up in this film deserves an Oscar nomination. 
* James Gunn needs to make up his mind on whether or not Star-Lord and Gamorra should be a couple
* Stan Lee's cameo with the Watchers is one of his best, especially because of the metaphor in the film's last end credits scene
* The Watchers are in this film! Here I thought FOX had exclusive rights to them
* Adam will not turn out well for the Sovereign ",69by9z
dh5ftws,"I dont think marvel did as good of a job as they usually do in making their movies interesting to wide age brackets, i spent most of the first half of the movie groaning at the in-for-face jokes aimed at what i assume is a very young audience.",69by9z
dh5ghib,A very fun movie and solid entry into MCU but definitely a step back from the first film. ,69by9z
dh8dxnx,"Just saw this movie. I really liked the first one, but this one seemed really forced. The first one was light and easy-going all the way through; it never took itself too seriously. This one seemed to want to be heavier, but didn't want to sacrifice that lightheartedness that the audience is expecting from it. So we get this back and forth between deadly serious and just plain goofy. Sometimes it works (like with the Pac Man part), but for the most part it made the flow choppy. 

Also, and I have this complaint about most Marvel movies, there's this massive universe full of groups that get clunkily introduced and we're supposed to take them at face value. For example, the whole Ravager ""code"" thing was thrown together as part of an oddly placed 5 minute scene. Marvel wants to make their fictional universe huge, so they do it by making it extremely diverse and having tons of groups with sci-fi names: ""The Sovereign,"" ""Ravagers,"" ""Nova Corps."" But they can't afford to spend much time in a 2 hour film to develop these groups and what makes them unique, so we have to just press the ""I believe"" button and take them at face value. Compare that to something like Middle Earth, where Tolkien went into extreme detail about each race to the point of inventing histories and made that the basis for their respective standings within the fictional world, which gives the reader/viewer a good idea of their motives, values, disposition, etc. I'm not saying that Marvel can or should be at that level. But if they know they can't dedicate enough time to developing a group's background and story arc, then they shouldn't rest so much of their plots on the backs of them. Seems like they haven't learned that less is more.

I wasn't disappointed with the movie, but the combination of the two complaints above made it seem forced. The plot was a little thin, but the acting and casting made it believable. But I think this one, while entertaining while I watched it, is largely forgettable. ",69by9z

dh5x09a,"My main complaint (even though I really like the movie overall), is that there were too many ""Legolas"" moments. I don't know if there's a term for it, but when something so ridiculous and physically impossible happens, it doesn't just bend my willing suspension of disbelief, it breaks it (Legolas running up the crumbling bridge in midair). 

In this one, it was Gamora hoisting a ship's machine gun cannon that's at least ten times her size on her shoulder and firing it full auto. I mean we've seen entire ships shake when it's fired, but it's like nothing for her. And we've been shown that she's maybe stronger than a normal person, but we're not given and prior indication that she has this level of brute strength. 

Also, there's a quick bit where Drax, Gamora, and Mantis are shown falling down to a rocky platform (where a Mantis puts Ego to sleep). They're shown free-falling for a second or two, then the camera cuts away for a second or two, then cuts back to them just landing on their feet, barely even bending their legs. Maybe I misread the situation, but I thought the camerawork implied they were dropping a couple hundred feet, so I was expecting something to happen to make their landing happen. But no, they just landed right on their feet like they had jumped down a step. I could have bought Drax landing like that, maybe Gamora, if at least Mantis, who has no physical training that we know of, landed badly",69by9z

If you heard about someone like that in real life , I don't think there are many people who would care about that person's redemption or absolution. I may be over thinking it but the film is asking us to go down this path with it's story and I can't. ",69by9z

They included two ""establishing shots"" of a Dairy Queen (one at the very start of the movie), presumably because Ego planted his seed in the woods behind it... but it's never explicitly mentioned or even relevant and the scene in the woods is remote.  There are no buildings or man-made infrastructure the be seen; It's a whole different setting.  As far as shameless plugs go, at least Power Ranger implemented the Krispy Kreme plug as comedic relief, as lame as it was.


You remove the shots of Dairy Queen from GotG Vol.2 and that's all you're removing; pictures of some suburban storefront.

I also appreciate that this movie going really bold with the color and scenery, from Gold Sovereign planet, white snowy city planet, to green ego planet.

Am I just seeing things?

I also noticed weird size/depth during other parts in the film, where someone further from the camera would have a much larger head than someone nearest the camera, and it made the nearer character look super tiny in comparison.

The execution of the film is fucking great though, and it's polished beyond belief. Tons of a little easter eggs. Also, Yondu cleaning up the Ravager's might be one of my favourite sequences in any of the Marvel movies. That's why he had to die. That Yandu dart is OP.",69by9z

I liked the idea of 4 sub stories all intersecting into one movie, but it felt too packed and over stuffed.  Baby Groot is of course adorable, and Yondu is of course badass and great addition to this film again. 

Otherwise its typical marvel humor, and characters which is nothing to gripe about.  However, it is starting to feel repetitive. 

",69by9z
dh5zdnp,"Saw the film last night. I've been marinating on the film overnight and seeing all of the positive praise it's getting, I just wanted to put my thoughts out.

It was a fun sequel, but it has a few minor flaws that really seem to tarnish the overall experience, mostly just stuff like dragging out small moments instead of letting them have the impact they deserve. For example(no spoilers), compare the final tear-jerking shot in the first film of Quills mom reaching out to him, to this film's revealing tear-jerking moment.... And it's easy to see that they didn't let it build as naturally as it should have.

But, this didn't necessarily lessen how impactful the defining emotional moment is; it's still a hell of a punch from an acting and character standpoint, but the movie itself didn't do it the justice it deserved. Driving to work, the moment flashed in my mind and I just got uncontrollably choked up. It works, but the movie could have benefited from a 'less is more' mentality the first film leaned so heavily on.

SPOILERS

You likely know what I'm talking about. Like, in hindsight, I want Yondu to step into a more fatherly role once he rejoins Quill. He never confronts Ego or tries to protect Quill the way I feel Yondu, as a father, would. See, it's like the movie knew the punchline, but forgot to set it up appropriately so that it flows the way it needs to. In the way they delivered it, it's almost as though the writers had two stories they wanted to tell: Ego as a daddy, and Yondu as a daddy. But didn't give themselves the time to do Yondu's part adequate justice. Also, they made his sacrifice a little too predictable, dragging it out with speeches and such rather than letting him have a moment of conviction and dedication that serves the impact of his triumphant moment better",69by9z

dh9yu3d,"Man this movie was great. It was just as good as the first part if not better. Groots opening sequence was amazing. The comedy was perfect and the action is just what you would expect.

Great movie all around.",69by9z
dhbfmxq,"The movie was pretty good don't get me wrong, it's just nowhere near close to as good as vol. 1. I think this movie just had a lot to live up to almost as if it were the younger sibling of an older, smarter, cliche captain of the football team brother or sister. Every other line seemed like a joke I felt as though I would suddenly hear the cheesy sitcom studio audience pre recorded laughing. Also, the first movie is a piece of art framed by the hand-carved imported wood of a soundtrack whereas this one didn't seem as fitting to me. The only songs that seemed fitting were Mr.Blue Sky and Father and Son. All of the extra (sort of unnecessary) Drax scenes sort of reminded me of Avengers AOU how that movie's rightful title is ""Hawkeye Age of Ultron"". Lastly, it just seemed so un-superhero-movie-esque what with the whole ""fun for the whole family"" vibe it gave me. Not to be totally and utterly negative towards this movie because I did enjoy it, even though I am really making it sound otherwise. Yondu turned out to be my favorite character considering everything he did in the end. Yondu also had the most epic fight scene in the movie. Baby Groot is such a fan favorite so there are no complaints in that department but I think even the end credit scene with Groot could possibly trump some of even the better scenes in the movie",69by9z

But because I want to force myself to examine movies critically for various reasons, I'll try to approach this structurally. Please excuse if this get too pompous/iamverysmart at any point.

The more I think about this, the more I think that this movie was 'Avengers meets Pixar'. The Avengers part because it's an ensemble story wherein each person gets a few moments of awesome and to stand out, their character's nature has to be amped up to the nth degree to break through the mass of story. So Rocket becomes very self-centred, Drax becomes a memelord, Starlord is a cross between Han Solo and a kid pretending to be Han Solo. And because everything is dialed up character-wise the characters, it's almost like we're getting parodies of the characters. 

The Pixar part is because Pixar is frighteningly goiod at identifying the emotional core of a story and then hitting that mark again and again and again. This is a very good thing actually. A lot of big movies could use to learn that lesson. But the problem in this case is that we're usually dealing with one character's story at a time. Toy Story is the only exception to this I can think of as far as Pixar movies go, but even then it's only following two stories, and even then Woody and Buzz stay together throughout the whole thing. But here you have Starlord's daddy thing, and the emotional core there is 'you make your own family', then you have Rocket-Yondu's story which is 'don't push away your family' and then Gamorrah and Nebula have their own story. Now there's a common thread throughout all three which is basically family, but that's not really enough for characters that follow their character arc separately and only come together for the setpieces. In some ways, because Drax doesn't have an arc crammed in there, he's just allowed to be as a character and pipe in as the comic relief occasionally. Compare that to Guardians 1 where the central core of the story was 'can these people work as a team'. And all of the characters' emotional journey was a reflection of that overall theme and more importantly it was done -together- instead of each on their own. So back to the Pixar bit, we're getting too many emotional journeys/cores and not enough time spent on each for them to feel truly meaningful.

It was a good movie, and it was a very enjoyable movie at a first viewing. It was a movie that is also really great at the fan service(this is not a negative thing) with Groot. I just don't know that it'll hold up after another watch or two in the same way that Guardians 1 has because the emotional and character part of the story isn't quite there.",69by9z

So, is Marvel just saying ""F that"" original stuff and here's a whole new scenario where-in the characters of Ego and J'son are merged? So, we'll never have that huuuuge father-son story arc from the comics? 

If not, and Ego was only pretending to be Quill's father (as he shapeshifted to The Hoff after being shot and mentioned something along those lines), then how the hell did Peter wield the planet powers against Ego?

dh5r4qc,"It was ok.

Though I felt the visuals in the end were a let down. They just didn't feel like they were giant blockbuster quality. Especially the skeleton. Felt more like a low grade Halloween film from the 90s.",69by9z
dh6z04r,"I just got home and while I enjoyed it, I didn't love it the way of loved Volume I (which, seriously, I LOVED).  There was just so much wanton death.  First all of Yondu's crew are killed (including the Irish guy played by the actor who played Chibbs on Sons of Anarchy and that really pissed me off). Then Yondu and his arrow of doom take out the whole crew except for Kurt from Gilmore Girls.  I was simultaneously put off by all the killing and taken out of the show by recognizing all these actors from TV.  

The other thing I just couldn't get over is the miraculous way all the Guardians survived explosions, falls from great heights, strafing fire from aircraft piloted by people with a SERIOUS grudge, etc.  I hesitate to use this word because it's a super-hero / comic-book movie but, their survival just seemed so unrealistic.  I don't recall feeling that way during Volume I.

And last but not least, the music did not grab me the way it did in Volume I. That schtick seemed a bit tired.

Potential Plot-hole:  I'm pretty sure Yondu was wearing the red iron mohawk arrow guidance system when his body was disintegrated.  So how come Kurt was wearing it in the first of the post-credit scenes where he's trying to learn how to work the arrow?

ETA:  I do have a question for the peanut gallery.  Why do you think they gave baby Groot a uniform while he was captive on that ship.  Just so he would look more uncomfortable?  I kept thinking that was Chekov's gun and was waiting for it to go off.  

And I had the same reaction to that food/fruit on the ship.  The semi-cyborg sister kept asking for some and everyone would say ""It's not ripe"".  Then she finally gets some and . . . says it's not ripe.  Is that a joke from the comics that I just don't get?

[The comment was when Quill and Rocket were trading barbs and Quill called him a ""trash panda"". Given that the film takes place in 2014 I had to go and look up when the phrase ""trash panda"" was first used. It was apparently coined here on reddit by /u/CarlPeligro in early 2014. So does Quill have access to reddit? He gets a Zune at the end of the film so obviously earth technology is something that is traded in the wider galaxy. I can't think of how else he would know the phrase trash panda, and it seems a stretch that he would invent it at the same time as /u/CarlPeligro.](#spoiler)

dh89kwm,"**edit* On second thought, I originally just posted a few reasons why the movie just didn't work for me and why I thought it was a kids movie no different than say a Pixar's feature. Which I said wasn't a bad thing, that I realized I'm not the target demographic for this movie. Also that it *doesn't* mean it's a shit movie, and that I didn't think a kids movie warranted a critical breakdown on how so many of its elements didn't work. Because, for kids movies, I'm very lenient as it's not really that important so long as it's entertaining for the rugrats then that's all that really matters. But fuck it, I'm going to tear this movie apart now because you cunts can't tolerate dissenting opinions and I will rub my nipples while tearing into this schlock. Which will be useful when in 6 months the fanboy-circlejerk for this movie dies and the counter-circlejerk begins. As is the way of r/movies. That which is circlejerk may never die! But jerks again harder and stronger!

Where to even begin? Welp... the movie basically has no plot and meanders around aimlessly. Marvel finally figured out how to break their sequel curse. Critics can't criticize a bad plot if you don't have a plot! ^(*[insert pointing finger at head meme]*)

They opted for character building instead of having a plot, okay, that *could* work if done right ^(*spoilers: it wasn't!*). Except the characters are all cartoonishly hyper-exaggerated versions of themselves from the 1st GotG and poorly over-acted the whole movie. Everybody was [hamming](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/0003428886_10.jpg) it up so hard that I thought Danny Devito was going to fill this movie with rum and take it to the Jersey Shore. So these people are no longer fleshed out characters, they are flat caricatures. Whatever sort of quirk they had in the first one was jacked up to the N^th degree in this one. It's so bad that this series no longer has a comic relief because **everybody** is the comic relief. 

The worst offender was Nebula. Even Drax, who dialed it up to over 9000, fell short. Karen Gillan's acting was fucking atrocious. Like she legitimately put Jim Carrey to shame in the over-acting department. Which would be fine and dandy *for a kids movie* but you fanboys didn't want to hear that this is a movie for kids. I'll say it again, there are movies for all ages, and there are movies for kids. Jurassic Park, Ghostbusters, [insert any number of other films] are movies for all ages. A movie like Jurassic Park is geared more for adults but also easily accessible for children, hence why it works so well for *all* ages. GotG2 was geared for kids. 

Or... no. I should take that back. Nebula wasn't the worst offender. Gamora was. Because she actually had *negative* development in this movie. She *regressed* as a character from the first film. GotG1 sets her up as this badass warrior that don't take none of Quill's sass, strong independent green woman who don't need no man. But now? Now in GotG2 she does nothing in this movie except be a love interest for Quill. She has no arc, she has no growth. She's just the prize for Peter at the end of the movie.  

It is gratuitous in its level of violence, but it is all ""*Looney Tunes*"" violence. There is no blood/gore, no weight or importance behind any of it. It is murder/violence played as and for *comedy*.  The tone behind all of the murder is lighthearted and goofy. It is especially evident the scene you see Rocket in the woods, with the wide shot of people going up and down in the trees back and forth. The speed and tone of these people being pummeled is done at a pace that gives it a lighthearted comedic vibe. It was so bad that I am shocked they didn't use a [slide-whistle to coincide with the ups & downs of the group](https://youtu.be/Qa7uLxu0XAc).

The violence in GotG2 is on the same plane as Wile E. Coyote falling from a cliff landing with a thud and poof-cloud, or having boulders crush him with an ""*ouch*"" sign popping up through the rubble. It's goofy, which is good for laughs, but there's also no danger to any of it. 

There is noooo subtlety to anything in this movie. Every character spells out all their backstory and motivations. Hey, you know how Rocket is a wee bit of an asshole that pushes people away so he doesn't get close to them? Well guess what? We're *literally* going to state exactly that out loud! Not figuratively literally. *Literally* literally. This way when you see him open up to somebody it makes sure you realize he's trying to have an arc!

This movie forces in way too much lowbrow humor to make up for a lack of any narrative thrust. Besides the lame penis jokes I'm genuinely surprised they didn't have a fart joke tossed on for good measure. And you couldn't have a single moment in this movie attempt to inject a ^teency bit of emotion without it *instantly* being undercut by the forced humor. It's like they were afraid if they went more than 2 minutes without making a joke or attempting some slapstick that audiences would realize ""*hey.... it's been an hour and nothing has happened yet!*"" 

When a movie has this much forced humor... when humor is hit or miss and it misses a lot it really hurts everything else going on. The **Taserface** running gag, jesus man. And the cringiest scene being the Quill and Ego playing catch scene. I couldn't believe that *that* was what I was seeing, like ""*yep, this is actually happening*."" 

The editing in places is disjointed. Some scenes seemed to go nowhere, like the pile of bones. Nothing comes of that at all, it doesn't affect Quill. And others scenes, like baby Groot getting the prototype fin, dragged on too long. Multiple scenes just sort of quickly ended and we jump forward elsewhere without any proper transition, in part because everybody was separated everywhere... which I'll get into more in a bit. 

Ego dropping the tumor-mom-bomb on Quill made absolutely no sense. He had no reason to toss that wrench into the gears when he was basically home free in convincing Quill to join his side. He had Quill right on the precipice of agreeing that destroying countless ecosystems/planets & genocide of countless civilizations was *totally cool* so long as it meant doing it with his biological father! How fucking ridiculous. Quill never struggled with any of this...

^(**Small note* also, just saying, that blob of expanding whatever on the planets? The fuck happen, did they run out of CGI money and just use a workprint that wasn't finished? That looked godawful, like circa-2001 CGI.*) 

So yeah, speaking of convincing him to join Ego and abandon his family? That seemed to happen **really easy**. Isn't Quill and all these people he's fought alongside for months supposed to be ""*family*""? This is done so easy that when Drax did his best Dom impression and said ""*we're family*"" I laughed because nothing about these guys made me buy that bs. The whole movie they spent so much effort to get away from one another. A movie about how these guys are a tight bonded family and the whole movie these guys are always going off doing stuff solo. They immediately dump Rocket/Groot to travel elsewhere, Drax chills more with Mantis than anyone else, and Quill tells everybody to fuck off because this random dude that decided to force himself into his life *might* be his dad. Are these guys really that tight a family? If they are this movie didn't show it. 

What **should have happened** was, plot wise, Ego doesn't need Quill to join him and together they rule the galaxy as father and son. Tell him that, sure, but what Ego's plan *really is* is that he needs Quill's *body*, to take it over. His motivation should be as he already mentioned and there's a good setup for. He can't leave that planet for too long without his form dying, and he needs Quill's body so he can have a solid form that will allow him to travel the cosmos without a need to return. Which, by the way, they fucking killed that concept as he totally gets his body destroyed and just... reforms it (*in a pretty metal scene, I will admit*). Totally undercut the concept that he needed to put a tumor in the mom's brain since he could just reform a new body when that one dies off. 

Anyhoooo. Then Gamora & Nebula find the giant pile of bones, they confront Mantis, and she says they're all the previous attempts Ego has done and failed. Gamora tells Quill about it. He confronts Ego about it and asks what's going on, they start to argue, one thing leads to another and in his frustration Ego blurts out something along the lines ""*I haven't worked this hard and put the tumor in your mom's head for you to get cold feet...*"". It should have been a slip up, not so casually mentioned like his favorite cake recipe. He knows how attached Quill was to his mom. 

Onwards. So we get to the final fight. Ego can't stop Groot from bringing the bomb to his heart... that's a brain. Okay? He's essentially a god but I guess he left that thermal exhaust port open just large enough that a T16 capable of hitting a womp rat could make the killshot. Oh, and in case you can't figure out why... Quill in the middle of the action will have a jump cut to him so he can give the audience exposition on what Groot needs to do. Again, no subtlety in this film.

So Ego fights Quill in Kurt Russell form because... ? He doesn't just collapse that chamber and crush everyone? Okay. And Quill is only part-Ego yet able to utilize Ego's power equally as effective as Ego can. Yeah... This is a smorgasbord of dumb. Quill should not have made an equal physical match against Ego, what **should have happened** was Quill was more creative... know where I'm going? more creative and able to make a bunch of *weird shit Ego couldn't anticipate*! Ooooh how they had a perfect setup for that and fucked it up. It would have been visually stunning as well as apt for the situation. Instead they both just did some flying tackles against one another and DBZ'd it with some punching.",69by9z

Even if he only had to whistle four times to kill them all, a gang of people will guns can kill you while you stride towards them whistling. Also doesn't it require the fin to use?

dmijso8,"I've been saying this since the first movie but this franchise gives me a very Futurama-ish vibe. Quill wears a red leather jacket, has reddish hair styled up in the front, has a sort of immature, goofy sense of humor, and goes on space adventures with a crew of misfits. 

He reminds me of Fry to the point that it would be hard to imagine someone at Marvel isn't a fan of Futurama. That goes double for when he was trying to be serious in the second movie but ended up doing it in a goofy way, like ""You shouldn't a killed my mom and squished my walk man.""",69by9z

Knowing how to fix everything (especially when you're surrounded by moronic psychopathic henchmen) makes you valuable, even if you don't have the highest kill count or steal the most loot.  His relative comfort and lack of ambition made him easy to boss around though, which wasn't much of a problem for him so long as Yondu was boss. Kraglin likey didn't realize the sort of sway he had with the rest of the crew until Tazerface's mutiny at which point it was way too late.

If he'd just said, ""I don't care."" before attacking Steve, it would've been fine.

3. The whole team in the ""Cathedral"" after arriving on ego's planet at the beginning (again, not sure the exact timing here)
4. Kinda looks like a tentacle coming down onto groot so maybe the intro scene
5. Peterr, Groot , and rocket outside the hole they drilled into the core when rocket shines the flashlight
6. Mantis making ego sleep while drax and gamora are behind her rooting her on
7. I remember someone having this line, I think it is rocket talking to peter but i'm not sure at all
8. *shrugs* someone wearing peter's headphones or something
9.  Peter fighting ego (maybe)
10. Gamora runs into the room with nebula behind her to push mantis against the wall
11. Possibly the scene where they are getting nebula from the sovereign with the crowd behind them (my only clue here is that is the only scene with a big crowd of people and that those kinda look like sovereign ships) but the 3rd guy here looks like yondu with the mohawk which makes me think it is some deleted scene
12. Groot holding the tied up rat to yondu and rocket when they send him for the fin
13. I think it is peter being smashed into and getting stuck in that rock wall when fighting ego
13.5. Other possibility is groot being crushed by the rocks in the core

",69by9z
dh5xp37,Rocket projecting onto the whole funeral scene was what got me. It was just so insightful -- Rocket is fully aware throughout the film of his personality flaws and he feels like he and Yondu are the same in the way they deal with emotions and relationships. So to find out that there always will be people who care about him and that you can be a dick and still find redemption. You wouldn't see such a nuanced moment in most tentpole action flicks. ,69by9z

dh76v0s,"The ""flashback"" moment Peter had was one of my favourite scenes. It was quick but it gave a lot of what we did not see from his life and I loved that.

dh5isrx,It was good that someone actually died though. The other Marvel movies have all the fake out deaths that it just feels cheap.,69by9z
dh5mm0h,"Yondu's death was really heavy and one of the most emotional scenes in the MCU so far. It wasn't super surprising, though, Yondu's abilities have been kind of understated, considering how he can walk into a room full of dozens of trained fighters and kill them all in seconds by whistling. How do you write him into a fight scene when he can kill an army in just a few minutes?",69by9z
dh5erbc,"Same! Him and Drax stole the movie. 

Yon's monologue to Rocket was so so good! ",69by9z

dh7q1hi,I think it's Deadpool for me.,69by9z
dhcuatu,why?,69by9z
dh5oeh5,I loved the nod back to the Vol1 after credits scene with Groot nto dancing while Drax is looking at him.,69by9z
dh5suiz,"I think this is #2 and the opening dance on GOTG1 is #1. I can't articulate why, but that shot of peter dancing from a distance when the giant title pops up does something for me. I thought it was incredibly original, at least relative to recent movies that I have seen.",69by9z
dh5pnkk,"Agree.

Baby Groot was good in the movie, but that opening scene made me smile so much. So good.",69by9z

dh5eblw,"The conflict was just so straightforward for him. They go to Ego, find out he's his Dad, his Dad proposes taking over the universe and he says no. Felt like not much happened in terms of story. Most of the change and development happened in the characters. 

Still not sure whether I liked the villain of Ego or not. ",69by9z
dh5f0ve,Just like Luke in 'Empire strikes back'. ,69by9z
dh5fs4t,"I don't disagree, but I'm alright with it because of how much development happens for the other characters.  Unlike a lot of superhero movies, this team feels very fleshed out even though they've only had two movies AND none of then have had their own solo movies like the members of the Avengers.  The GOTG films had a lot of character building to do in just two films and they've done a pretty damn good job of it. ",69by9z
dh5prz0,Pratt can be pretty funny at times but there were moments of cringe when he had to act serious and it just want working for me,69by9z
dh5sjy2,It was really funny seeing him trying to squeeze out a single tear during those emotional moments.,69by9z
dh5ozco,The catch scene is probably the most memorable for me. The first cut to Kurt Russells face is all time. ,69by9z
dh68l0f,I love Chris Pratt in these movies but I'm glad we got to see the others get the screen time they did as well. It's well deserved. ,69by9z
dhrvwtz,"He seemed...off this time around, specifically during Peter's emotional moments ",69by9z
dh60a29,"While he was better during the funeral scene, when Yondu actually died, he was emoting very poorly. I'm not sure if Chris Pratt is a good actor. ",69by9z
dh9wvef,"I think that was the point. The Avengers Team up was so good because, even though you could argue for Tony and Steve co-captaining until the end, everyone has their important part to play. This movie just proved clearly that Pratt is the group leader, but the dynamic is incredibly varied with each character having their part to play. Any one of them could lead their own interesting arc with Pratt being off screen and no one feels like he's missing.


It's a genius way to keep a rotating roster of characters. I came into this movie thinking it was really just the 5 of them in the series. It now feels like they pick up extra members continuously as they have major conflicts. ",69by9z
dhg7e5x,I think that's perfectly ok too. ,69by9z
dh5uzsg,"Same :/ though Pratts acting really helped give it more depth. If he wasn't such an emotional actor his arc would've been pretty useless, and definitely not as memorable.
Though I do really like how they're showing him dealing with his moms death and being more emotional overall. Like in the first one he's trying to avoid his mom (also he was pretty shallow in the first tbh) and now he's dealing with the grief like it's still fresh. The scene where ego reveals he gave Merideth cancer and Peter immediately shot him really showed how much he cares.
Plus him thinking about his friends and family are what sorta puts the breaks on Egos control over him really shows how much he's changed too",69by9z

dh9vvpb,"No way, dude. Your comments and others about how this movie affected them --specifically Yondu-- are why I've been coming throwing the comments section for three nights. I love movies, and I love hearing how they affect the audience in personal ways. It's like art that reveals a truth that guides you emotinally to connect to yourself or those around you. It's important, the storytelling aspect, to come to terms of ourselves, our future, and our others around us, and I feel proud for James Gunn to have pulled that off for you. ",69by9z

dhxak0o,"Drax was absolutely scene stealing and the best part of this movie.  I found it quite interesting that he held her above the ""quicksand"" but when he got to the ship, he tossed her to the floor like a sack of potatoes.  I'm not sure how to interpret that difference.

Also, bonus points for not making it a romantic relationship.  I thought that was where it was heading and was about to groan at the ""So are you"" until the pause and ""on the inside.""  Glorious.",69by9z

dh5nhxv,"I think ego didnt vies peter as a threat. He has absolute dominion over the planet through millions of years of experience using the power. He could force what he wanted out of peter. And he told peter because personally he thinks it wad the right thing to do, and thought peter might also be blinded enough by the glory of being god over the galaxy to also let it slide.

In a way, peter accepting his actions validates his reasoning, and ego probably really wants that to releive whatever bit of guilt he feels.",69by9z
dh5niof,His ego got the best of him,69by9z
dh5qwdn,"His name is Ego and also a god, underestimating mortals is low for him. His hubris added to his character.",69by9z
dh5qokw,My feeling is that his reason for doing so is not expecting the human side to overpower Peter's celestial side. Kinda goes with the whole arrogance theme. Figures that he's so stoked on being a god that nothing else would matter.,69by9z
dh5q1jl,"Well, no pun intended, but I think that was more him having a big ego. He was so convinced that his ""purpose"" was so clear that there no way Peter would turn away from it. Or something. Maybe I'm just thinking too hard about it. ",69by9z
dh5t5d9,"Smarts doesn't always overcome being an asshole who's full of shit. Ego has a very fitting name, ultimately. He believes himself better than any human, and he thinks that once Peter gets a taste of his celestial power and scope, human affairs will seem trivial. Ego thought it was something okay to do in the first place, which shows how far off his moral reasoning is. 

Basically Ego's head is so far up his own ass that empathy isn't his strong suit. Thus his mistake. ",69by9z
dh5nvd6,"How much of his billion year life did he spend studying humanity?  That is why it didn't matter to him. It q, like. All life was meaningless. ",69by9z

Though he was a few minutes away from using Peter as a battery, so...  ",69by9z
dh5zfuz,"Agreed! The only reason I could think was that he's so over-confident that he'd taken hold of Peter's mind.

In the comics, Ego is always over-confident, though, so fits the character.",69by9z
dh6v71b,"Probably comes from the detachment of being a god. He saw no wrong in killing this woman, so why would anyone else?",69by9z
dhaa42m,"I mean...Ego not understanding the value of finite life-forms was kind of the whole theme. He just showed Peter Eternity. He was on board. Why would he care about his long-dead HUMAN mother, when he now knew he was an immortal god with the power of creation?",69by9z
dh5vp4l,I chalk it up to arrogance and sheer misunderstanding of what love is ,69by9z
dh5x8iw,Yup. That *almost* ruined the scene for me... and then Peter blasted him to pieces without hesitation and I was back in love with the movie again. ,69by9z
dh668uc,"It's somewhat consistent with Ego in the Marvel Universe. At one point Charles Xavier gets involved with him. He determines him to be irrational and has to shut his mind down. 

Ego is smart, but crazy and impulsive at times. ",69by9z
dh6fu0l,"Yeah, that part really bugged me. You have him completely on your side, so you say the one thing that will make him turn on you? It was so stupid.",69by9z
dh79hm6,"I think he relied on his own power (his... ego, if you will) after he showed Peter the ""infinity"" of his vision and Peter's eyes changed.

dh7gqj0,"I think he thought Peter would have overlooked it since he was becoming a ""god"".",69by9z

dh7eywy,"Also... The Collector had a smaller role than Stallone did in Vol 2... hardly the same thing. 

The Sovereign were in the beginning, middle and end. They were introduced in the opening of the film, their chasing the guardians cause them to crash land. They then send the Ravagers to track them in the second act. And they show up again during the climax!

Plus an end credits universe building scene (the only one of the five).

I didn't like them, I thought they were a running joke that stopped being funny halfway through and probably should have been written out to give more screen time to Yondu and his crew but I think Gunn felt he needed to add something to the dynamic of the first film. ",69by9z
dh5wdm5,I couldn't place the voice and face so i looked it up. Taserface is Benny from Stranger Things.,69by9z

dh5xq5t,"Bingo.  People kept expecting this top-down, plot-driven story like the first.  It's not that at all, and it isn't trying to be on any level.

This is a *character-driven* story.  Everything that happened here is the result of each character just being themselves within proximity of the others. 

IMO, that's exactly what was missing from the first film.  It was a great introduction, sure, but I want to actually give a fuck about these characters after another installment, and that means adding some depth we didn't get in Vol 1.

AFAIC Vol 2 was exactly what it needed to be, and accomplished what it set out to do.",69by9z
dh5wt9c,"True, they spent a lot of time on character development, getting to know each one quite a bit more.  I wasn't thrilled when I first realized it wouldn't add much to the overall Infinity storyline though.  Also was not happy with Yondu story, he was becoming my favorite one!  Overall this definitely felt like a  setup movie where they had fewer strings attached, which is a good thing.  They were more loose with the humor this go around taking more chances, working on character story.  Overall, I enjoyed it.",69by9z

dhaxbep,"Honestly, after some reflection, I think that I like Vol 2 better. It's close. The overall quality of both films is high and they max out on the cinematic vision (god, those visuals are just gorgeous!). 

What bumped 2 up, in my opinion, is that Ego is simply a better and more interesting antagonist than Ronan, in my opinion. Ronan is kind of the posterboy for generic Marvel villainy. he's just there to make sure that the Guardians have something to react to and against. Ego, on the other hand, fully feels like part of the story and there's emotional weight to the conflict between him and the rest. ",69by9z

the first ""Guardians"" was great with all the ""how the team gets together stuff"" but was pretty meh in the last third (the whole Ronan story including the showdown was paint-by-the-numbers). the new movie at least tries to have different characters arcs that play into the resolution of the threat etc. (I'd argue that ""less is more"" would have applied here, I would have prefered if they had cut one of these side stories).

[Actually I'd like to point out that the ""Ego isn't a good guy"" comes off in the first scene of the movie.  He's a space man who has literally been 'planting his seed' literally across the galaxy - and admits to doing so.  He, like another reference further in the movie, is a sailor who holds no responsibility for his actions and cares for nothing other than his own narcissistic self love and self purpose.  ](#spoiler)

[The build up to his change is subtle, small hints from his secretive interactions with Mantis and then Drax's comparison to Mantis and a pet, but the reveal is appropriate as Ego feels an ultimate betrayal from his creation.  However it was never a requirement for Peter to survive the transformation, Ego doesn't view him as an equal to share the experience otherwise he would just create more Celestial hybrids from the human race.  Peter is a tool, no different than a hunting dog, and when he doesn't do as his master commands him to do, and bites back, Ego beats him into submission.  ](#spoiler)

[This wasn't meant to be a story of grand scope.  Even though the stakes were actually incredibly huge considering what EGO was capable of doing, it was a personal story for all the characters.  In a lot of ways this is more like Empire because of that character driven narrative.  Empire Strikes Back wasn't about Luke defeating the Empire, it wasn't that Darth Vadar is this really big bad guy we have to hate - we've already been doing that.  Empire is about each character coming to terms with their strengths, weaknesses, and fallacies.  The resolve in Empire wasn't destroying some big bad weapon and now the galaxy is saved, it was Luke justifying his showdown with Vadar as saving his friends, except it was about him trying to get revenge on Vadar for killing his family - and then finding out Vadar is actually his Father.](#spoiler)

[I agree, maybe if they'd found a planet earlier in the film that had been remade by Ego in some kind of early test it may have been easier to understand the stakes.  It seemed pretty clear what the stakes were with Ego's matter altering seeds.  It may have been more interesting if the seeds were just clearing the land rather than creating this giant blob like over growths.  It'd be interesting if we see down the pike some more Thor related comic plot lines with Asgard and this now uninhabitable land on Earth - a little movie tie in with the rest of the marvel universe.](#spoiler)",69by9z

And when he talks about growing up showing people a picture of David Hasselhoff, you feel that punch of loneliness right in the stomach, and you're rooting for him to remake this connection he's been missing his whole life. And when Ego does his villain turn, sure it's another ""blah blah blah, destroy the galaxy"" motivation, but it hits Quill hard on a personal level AND it's a catalyst for him to realize that sometimes blood and family aren't the same things.

Whatever, but the movie painstakingly force feeds me Gamora and Nebula's sister or survive dynamic...it gives me Rocket and Yondu discovering their similarities, presumably Yondu at the end of his life reflecting on his mistakes while Rocket is presumably young and still able to change and make better choices etc.  Okay, fine.  But the moment Ego nonchalantly tells Peter that he had to give his mother the brain tumor...  WHY?  Destroying the galaxy with your plan to marry yourself to every living thing, isn't that evil enough to warrant the Guardians to stop him?  Why did we have this necessary connection to his mother's death?  So it would force Peter to choose to stop him?  I'd argue that the movie already setup that Peter's love for Gamora was mirroring Ego and Peter's Mother, and that Peter choosing his ""family"" over his father and celestial powers was the natural progression of Peter being part human and growing up on Earth etc.  Why shoe-horn in the brain tumor thing?

It was predictable, yeah, from a 4th wall perspective, but it didn't really make much sense as a motivation or as development of his character from an in universe perspective.

Better, in my view, would be if Ego had died defending Peter and the guardians from the golden people, or perhaps gave himself up to serve as a battery or something, and told Peter that family is more than just blood. Then the guardians have/had to save Ego (either in this movie or the next) and Peter still can learn to see the guardians as his family. Ego as a character made sense, but as a villain felt like it was shoehorned in.

[What also irked me was Peter seeing Yondu as a father figure. Yondu was a manipulative, evil kidnapper. Did he have a soft spot for Peter? Yes. Did that make him someone Peter should see as a dad? No. The only thing worse than that was the forced, joltish relationship between Peter and Gammora. It just felt like it was shoehorned in.](#spoiler for Peter and Gammora and Yondu)",69by9z

I actually truely believe that if Ego hadn't killed Peter's mother and let him know, that Peter would have gone through with helping Ego in his plan.

Gags like trying to make Groot find Yondu's hairpiece slowed the movie down and made it drag. Pacing was awful. 

The Gamora/Nebula character arc was given little thought and resolved in a cheesy way. 

It just wasn't good. In comparison to other Marvel films I've seen recently, Dr. Strange was way better than this. They still found ways to put in little cutesy jokes in the movie that I don't care to see, but at least the whole movie wasn't soaked in it.

Maybe he can't stay in humanoid form for too long away from his planet - which is why he had to leave Peter and Peter's mom. Maybe he hired Yondu to get her and Peter off earth back to his planet, but something happened and none of it could happen in time...  She died...

He encounters the High Evolutionary, who gives him the name ""Warlock.""

If you were getting transported, the consciousness you are experiencing would end, a clone of you would materialize at the destination experiencing it's own consciousness but basically from where you left off. BUT, it's not the same conscious mind continuing, the continuity is broken, and the clone continues.   

Groot and Baby Groot are the same Groot. BUT not. They aren't parent-child, it's the same person. With regards to his conscious mind, it's hard to tell. He seems as vulgar as before but reverted. So it might be a continuation, or it might be clone. ",69by9z

dhb6t32,"Empire Strikes Back is the gold standard for sci-fi/fantasy sequels. Anyone tasked with making a sequel to a successful sci-fi/fantasy movie is going to be pulling from ESB at some level, really. Some of this is going to be intentional, other bits might not be as consciously intentional but they just function really well and are basically 'natural' to put into a sequel. 

Other similarities you can draw. ESB involves separating the heroes into two groups with the main protagonist going to receive new tutelage that expands his capabilities while the other group is captured, betrayed and has to fight their way through the whole movie. The entirety of the movie shifting away from Space Opera and towards more close character drama. Guardians 1 had character drama as well, but it was still primarily dominated by its storyline motivating everything that happened on screen. In Guardians 2(and ESB) the storyline is less in focus and is structured more in the sense that it appears to react to the characters rather than their reacting to it. So for instance, Rocket stealing the batteries sets off a plot point, but that's motivated by Rocket *being Rocket*. Or in ESB's case something like the Asteroid Field sequence and Han's cockiness as well as his past catching up to him motivates the eventual betrayal. Contrast to ANH and Guardians 1 where the stories are motivated by Ronan and the Death Star amassing power and they need to be stopped. 

Still, that said, I think Guardians 2 played it safer than Empire as a sequel. One thing Empire did that was very ballsy was to completely shift the *tone* of the franchise, it practically changed what genre it is compared to ANH. Guardians 2 could never be mistaken for anything other than a Guardians of the Galaxy movie and it knows it and revels in it.

What bugs me about the Peter-Gamora relationship teasing is that they spent close to zero time together before he started insisting there was an ""unspoken thing"". I hate it when characters *tell* me there's an attraction between them instead of *showing* me with how they talk to and behave toward each other. Maybe there is or could be something there, but I haven't seen it yet, in either movie.

I don't know what it was about Peter and the Peter/Ego scenes, but in general I agree. The two of them playing catch was a nice touch, though.

I was generally okay with Yondu's arc, but I see what you mean. It wasn't bad, exactly, but it could have been a lot better. I think his arc typifies the two biggest problems with this movie, which are (a) that characters talk *about* other characters more than they talk *to* them, and (b) we get *told* about past events instead of being *shown* them.

""I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!"" was indeed gold, as was ""I HAVE FAMOUSLY HUGE TURDS"".

I never felt emotion towards his character one way or the other.  What I mean by more physical, is that the guardians really couldn't fight him head on.  Aside from Peter's own connection to the light, there was really no way for them to combat him.

It's actually a credit to Gunn and the movie itself that the movie was enjoyable as it was with such a lackluster villain especially in a genre that is generally defined by its villains.

I loved the movie but I do believe that is the one facet of the movie that fell short.",69by9z
dhpdiao,"Why do you think Ego introduced himself as a Celestial to Peter, despite him saying that he was the only one in existence?

dh5ney7,"I'd rather have a deeper look at the characters than have a forced ""goal"".

The reason why these characters are able to grow is because there was not much going on to distract from that. They were able to have a lot of intimate moments *because* they weren't smack-dab in the middle of shit going on. Remember the first film after Peter saved Gamora, even though the scene was played for laughs, that intimate moment couldn't last because they were on the enemy ship, and Ronan had some planet-destroying orb, too much shit going on.

And if they introduce a goal then pause it in the middle to do the development that they did in the middle of this film then there was no need to introduce a goal that early in the first place.

And if it's a goal just for the sake of a goal, then that's even more meaningless.",69by9z

I know not letting the villain live is a safe move for general audience approval, but I think we're at a point in the MCU where most people would be fine if the villain lived. No one ever dies in comics and some of the baddies are more developed and interesting than their hero counter parts. If we can safely cover Marvel topics of cosmic beings and magic, having a character live for more than one film shouldn't be that hard to pull off.

Of course why Peter's connection collapses when Ego dies is an oddity but one can argue it probably has to do with how many layers Ego went through to even have a child with such a different lifeform. I suspect Peter might be metaphysically speaking a little part of Ego (rather then a 'proper' Celestial child) that just so happens to act as a second self and that while Ego is maybe a little less for the exertion... it nets out to more power overall because Peter can now act as the second source.

They had just murdered all of his loyal crewmembers. I'd say they were ripe to be killed by Yondu in turn. If they had just dropped the rest off at a nearby planet or something, then sure, just kill the ringleaders, but when they all stand by and space out the loyal guys... no pity.",69by9z

It kinda reminds me of the controversy in Force Awakens when Leia hugs Rey while Chewie goes walking by. But some audience members only felt this way because Chewie was close in proximity -- the scene would have been fixed by putting Chewie in another area or leaving him out entirely. The scene was about two women who had both been impacted by Han Solo sharing some sort of mourning and generational understanding, but Chewie's presence distracted from what should have been the focus.

In this case, I'm not sure how it was written in the script, but I think it was the unfortunate coinciding of two different plot threads: the battle between Peter and Ego, and the ongoing conflict between Gamora and Nebula. Gamora falls so that we can have this nice moment of Nebula saving her. Unfortunately, because Gamora is so close in proximity to Peter, it wouldn't be believable for him NOT to react, but on the other hand, it wouldn't have hit the right moment in the respective characters' arcs if he had leaped to save her -- that would have left an opening for Ego to triumph and wouldn't have moved the Gamora/Nebula relationship forward. 

Essentially, this problem could have been fixed by having Peter and Gamora fighting in different areas, or having Peter get hit with an immediate impasse by Ego after Gamora falls. It was an error in staging that created unfortunate contradictions within character motivation. ",69by9z

Starlord was the only one who had the gene, which is why he was the only one who could help him do what he wanted. When he mentions the thousand years, he isn't implying that Starlord would last 1000 years, rather he was doing the equivalent of grounding him. He was going to use him for a thousand years as a battery then see if he had changed his outlook yet. After the thousand year Starlord would still be fine.](#spoiler)

[For your point about the sovereign. They view their lives as to valuable to risk, so they don't. That is why they hired the guardians. The carpet was intended to be comical, its a heavily comedy focused Marvel variant. For the last part, the remote drones were being used satirically. It was emulating an arcade, with each of them playing a 'game' using their drone. When the last guy is going after then and ultimately fails to beat the game the loser is supposed to be humorous about how quickly people turn on you when you lose in a game.](#spoiler)",69by9z

[Ego, is very narcissistic. So I'm guessing he wanted to be more than just one planet. But all existence. To recreate the world as he saw fit.](#spoiler)

[Quill learned how to control his powers with his heart. OooOooh. Nevertheless, maybe Ego in all his arrogance never expected Quill to be able to exert that level of control over his powers in such a short time. If you couldn't believe it, what makes it so hard to believe that the possibility never occurred to Ego either.](#spoiler)

[It's not fair to assume that Ego didn't try to use other sources of energy. In fact, he says he attempted to use his other offspring(which ended up being the skeletons) as other sources, but that failed.](#spoiler)

[Im confused as to how Quill is supposed to discover immortality without ""dying"" first.](#spoiler)

[I doubt even rocket can pull a drone out of no where. Or build a remote detonated explosive powerful enough to kill ego in a situation where he doesn't have enough space suits and rocket packs for everyone. He doesn't even carry around tape for god's sake.](#spoiler) 

[I guess this just wasn't Drax's film. Oh well. You could argue gamora and nebula didn't really do much either. It's just story telling.](#spoiler)

[Regarding Sovereign, they even said they hired the guardians because they did not want to expend any of their own resources. Kill a monster without using any of their own people/ships and all they had to do was give them Nebula. Also, you could also argue that the sovereign people aren't as good as the guardians. The entire film was them failing to kill the team. Maybe they don't have the capacity to kill that creature.](#spoiler)

dh9gl0l,">Was asking for the tape supposed to be that funny? I don't get it.

For me, part of the charm of these two films are the 'real life' bits. These are the things that aren't typically in a movie like this, but feel like actual conversations people have or dumb little things that go 'wrong'.

For example, when Ayesha's red carpet gets stuck. That to me was brilliant. We've all had moments like this in life when  we are trying to be all 'suave' and you do something klutzy or something doesn't come out quite right.

Or in the first film when Star Lord drops the Orb.

The tape scene was like that, it sort of made the characters feel more ""Human"". Even in the middle of this huge battle, they are arguing about petty crap.

It's kind of like in Pulp Fiction when Mia Wallace is OD'ing and Lance and Jodi were arguing about the ""Little black medical book."" Or Vincent and Lance's exchange in that same scene, or when Vincent is trying to convey to Jodi what he needs

""You got it?""

""What?""  

""A magic marker... A  FELT PEN! A FUCKING BLACK MAGIC MARKER!""

That scene is funny in Pulp Fiction for the same reason ""The Tape Scene"" is funny in GotG, it's not something you usually see. Usually in movies like this, people never drop the orb, red carpets never malfunction, Rocket has tape, you fall in a river and come out with your make up still good and your hair is perfect.

I laughed and had a great time throughout, but the first film is one of my favorite things ever, so I'm probably a little biased.

The only way he could fulfill what he believes is his purpose (to find other life and connect) was to irradiate and replace all life with something equal to himself. Which to him, doesn't exist, so he decided to become all life.

One particular watcher named Uatu revealed himself to The Fantastic Four and broke his species' vowel of staying hidden, which resulted with some interesting outcomes.

Adam Warlock is a little more complicated.  

A group of scientists called The Enclave (seemingly what The Sovereign were based of) sought to create the perfect human being.  Adam Warlock (originally known as ""Him"") is what came forth.  He immediately sensed that the scientists wanted to use him for nefarious purposes, lashed out against them, and then met Thor and Sif not long after.

Not knowing any better, Adam tries to force Sif to mate with him, and Thor kills Adam.  It's here you learn that Adam can rebirth himself by forming a regenerative cocoon similar to the one he was created in.  

Adam is found by The High Evolutionary who implants the Soul Gem (one of The Infinity Gems) in his forehead, gives him the moniker Warlock, and guides him down a path which leads him to becoming more human.

dh5xrr5,"the watchers watch throughout all of the universes and they do just that, they don't have a hand in on the events.

my favorite cameo of the watchers in the comics was during onslaught, they were seeing the changes from that universe and uatu (the main ""watcher"") invited apocalypse to join him to see the events unfold.

an agent of the watchers in this movie was stan lee, a huge nod to the fan theories, so all those movies we see stan lee in, he's in essence a ""watcher"" himself, they stopped short of giving him mantle because i believe of the naming rights that belong to fox.


atom? you mean adam warlock? he's the main guy who fights thanos and beats him eventually and welds the gauntlet himself. 

Of course, the perfect being is going to have an outstanding power set. Aside from the standard superhuman strength and durability, Warlock is capable of absorbing and storing cosmic energy. He can project this energy as a weapon or use it to augment his own physical abilities. In addition, he could also spin himself into a regenerative cocoon to heal himself or prevent death.",69by9z

Up until now, every other MCU movie introduced either new characters to the overal Avengers plot line or made some arcs to Thanos and the infinity stones.

As for Roger Rabbit, I'm with you there, I think the bizarro Jessica Rabbit would make for a great villain. P.S. the orignal is on Netflix.

After Guardians 1, I had already lowered my expectations for this one, but they doubled down on all the worst aspects of every. single. character. And not bad as in 'bad guy', but the worst, last interesting parts of them. They've neutered everything that made the comic book counterparts interesting. The only characters I can think of any sort of praise for are Ego (as predictable as he was, he was still pretty cool) and Yondu (who's redemption arc is only marred by his non ironic use of the word 'daddy').

I really wish the movie would have went one way or the other and remained consistent. 

I also felt the movie got too video gamey near the end, the characters started to feel like characters out of a videogame. 

I also felt there are scenes that could have been cut out or shortened (such as almost every scene with groot) as many of them seemed like when someone tells a joke that isn't landing, doesn't notice this but goes on for like 10 minutes while everyone stares in bewilderment. ",69by9z

1. The tone of GotG is really lighthearted, moreso than most of the other Marvel movies. It's just as much a comedy as it is a sci-fi action movie. Ending it with the main character alone in space watching his father figure die right before his eyes would have been a pretty damn dark ending. Not to mention, the next time we see the Guardians, we'd have to deal with that, which means you couldn't just jump straight into a fun opening sequence like the first two did.  
2. Unlike most movies, GotG is one block in a cinematic universe. The next time we see Peter and the team after Vol 2 will be Infinity War, a movie where they're not the key focus. You'd have to take time out of that film to look at how they dealt with Yondu's death, which takes the spotlight away from the main plot and characters.

I'm no professional movie reviewer, so you'll have to forgive me if this isn't as elegant as it could be, but I'll try to put my thoughts together.  I'm going to preface this with a **spoiler warning**, for obvious reasons.  I've tried to tag out what I think needs to be tagged, but go forward at your own risk.

Everything in the film seemed to be shoehorned to fit a theme of ""reconciliation"".  [Rocket was entirely different character in this film.  He went from a wise cracking badass to a complete asshole for no apparent reason.  It wasn't organic, and really just felt forced so that he and Yondu would have a reason to bond and so that Rocket would have a reason to reconcile at the end.](#spoiler)   Nebula went from a lethal assassin with no friends hellbent on killing her sister at any cost, [to a member of the gang in zero seconds flat.  Furthermore, her entire driving force of wanting to kill Gamora was completely scrapped at their first real interaction.  They fought for a bit, then saved each others' lives.  There was an explanation, but it was paper thin.  They just needed to reconcile to fit the theme.](#spoiler)   Speaking of Gamora--that fight with Quill?  Did it serve any purpose in the film, or did they just need a reason to make up?  Quill reconciling with Ego and Yondu were the only two times it really felt natural.  Why?  Because these were natural extensions of relationships that were already in place, not 180-degree character turns. 

Drax's character also went through some weird stuff.  [That one scene in the first movie where he laughed uproariously while in the crashing ship was made to be a major part of his character.  All he does now is laugh like he's on a roller coaster whenever there's a little action or a scene that needs to be broken up.  He lost a lot of the charm and subtlety that he had in the first film.](#spoiler) 

The ""relationship"" between Quill and Gamora is just terrible.  There's no chemistry, and no reason for them to be together.  In the first film, it was obvious that he was only into her because he's the action hero and she's the girl.  The second film didn't try to expand on that, and gave us no reason to care.  On the other hand, we had what felt like a natural budding friendship/romance between Drax and Mantis that actually matches their characters.  That only serves even more to show how flimsy Quill/Gamora is.

Baby Groot mostly gets a pass for me.  He's obviously mostly in there to cash in on his marketing value based on how popular the post-credits scene in the last move became, but whatever.  I didn't like him, but I at least understand his purpose in the movie and it doesn't really detract from the film.  It's okay to have an over-the-top comic relief character, even though your entire movie is little more than excuses to put in comic relief.

Gamora really never had much of a character in either movie, and does absolutely nothing to carve out a space for herself in this one.  There's nothing compelling about her, and her only role so far seems to be love interest/sister.

So there you go, 4/5 of the main crew was absolutely dreadful.  None of them developed into more compelling characters than they were in the first film, and most of them regressed.  Quill pretty much stayed the same.

They all had some great moments, don't get me wrong.  [Drax talking to Mantis about his family.  Baby Groot not understanding what people are trying to tell him.  Rocket with his ravager hunting.](#spoiler)   But that brings me to my second point.  So much of this movie felt like excuses to get these scenes together.  It's like they had a list--[Baby Groot not understanding anything, Yondu killing everyone, soldiers treating combat like an arcade game, etc.](#spoiler) , and they just needed to fill in the gaps between.  Because of that, the plot feel really hollow.  It's just characters waiting around for things to happen to them.

Visuals were great, action was great, jokes were great, music was great.  Most everything was great, except when characters were undercut for no good reason, and the movie feels like a series of scenes rather than a cohesive whole.

All in all, I'd put it at like a 7.  Better than most things out there, but far from perfect.  For perspective, I'd put Guardians 1 at like an 8.5.",69by9z
dhabsll,"Spoilers.

I feel it was a horrible plot. Ego being evil, and even more so pathetically cartoonishly evil (I want the whole universe to be ME!), and killing the mother just made everything so weak.  It was completely inconsistent between capable of destroying a fleet a will to not being able to beat a talking a racoon with a gun.  Million year old being of ultimate power, not being able to find a *single* other Celestial? Not being able to realize that talking about his mom would set him off? Not willing to just let him live his life for 100 years until his friends died off and then try and recruit him?

To be honest I could go on and on, it was actually enraging.  Extremely insulting to viewers intellect as well as a great example of just making characters dumb to force plot.

Only other complaint I have is the love story was so forced and unnatural it was just uncomfortable at times.

Effects and humor were amazing, really enjoyed pretty much all the characters",69by9z
dhjvk02,"it was really really really lacking in tension. 

They just shoehorn in a ""the whole universe is in peril from ego"" for no reason. It's more than enough to tell us about ego, and have him be the villain. Why are they saving the whole galaxy again? They even make a joke about it. It's incredibly damaging to the tension. 

There's a scene where they are like ""we need to get to the high atmosphere"" . .. . 

and the solution is ""Look a big rock pillar is rising out of the ground, jump on that, of course it will rise all the way to the high atmosphere"" ... it's like... WUT the fuck? ",69by9z
dhjseck,"I agree with you, I was really disappointed. The exposition was extremely clunky. The first act seemed to drag on forever without presenting the main conflict. The direction called too much attention to the fact that you were sitting and watching a movie. The character arcs and subplots (Gamora and Quill's relationship, the Gold people, Rocket and Yondu's escape, Gamora and Nebula's relationship) were poorly tied together and felt like they were only there for the sake of including characters that didn't need to be there. All of the stuff between Quill and his dad lacked emotional depth because of how suddenly Ego appeared and how quickly Quill accepts everything he says, then turns on him--the pacing of all of these events was really weird and left me dissatisfied emotionally. Even the soundtrack--the way the characters constantly called attention to it and the way The Chain was literally used as a story-telling device--it was distracting. Gunn shoehorning his brother into the film (Kirk from Gilmore Girls) was awkward, and the use of tight-shots on the actors in so many scenes made me feel like the budget for this had been slashed down to that of a TV season.

It was funny, but that didn't save the story for me. Honestly, I think Age of Ultron was a better film than this one, because the plotline was at least tighter.

One, they cannot believe anybody would ever slight them or be dishonest to them (anyone who does so must pay). And two, killing them would show they are a force to be reckoned with.

Well, he chose to take a single form and kept the rest of his world completely devoid of sentient life so that he'd have an individual avatar, but... what if he isn't the only space brain out there? How do you know that **Earth** doesn't have one just like him in its core?

And at that point where did Ego come from? Maybe there are super space brains. Or maybe the whole universe is one big brain? Etcetera.

dhahoin,"I politely disagree with you. This movie was a mess, both story wise and character-wise. I'm gonna break down my ideas, and if you wish, you are welcome to read them and comment. 

So, I believe that all the parts with the Golden People were a huge waste of time. They were annoying and they only served the purpose to be annoying boring characters. As a plot device, they don't work very well, too (Yundu had already placed a device on their ship to track them down). For some reason, this movie decided to not have an actual plot and just ""wonder"" for the first half of the movie in nothingness. 

So they ""stumble"" into a planet in which Ego follows them and decides to take them, a story device used to separate the crew. Granted, Rockets side of the story was far more interesting than Starlord's (knowing that in the Comics Ego was not the father, made me suspicious since the beginning of how it was gonna go). 
While at first it felt nice to see him reunite with his parent, his lack of surprise or emotion upon discovering he was a GOD was weird. As well as the complete disappearance of grief from Starlord when he discovered his father put a tumor in his mother's brain (and please don't say that he did not care enough for him, he fought against Gamora to defend the Ego-maniac). 

Drax was just there, BUT his lines were by far the best (the laughing scene got akward after a few seconds). Groot was nice. 
Rocket and Yundu were the best part of the movie, and although the battleship battle was awesome, that whole segment of the movie felt extremely disjointed from the actual movie.
The battle between Peter and Ego was really...dumb, just like Zod vs Superman. Also, Pacman thing? Was that really the moment? I don't mean to say it ruins the epicness, what I mean to say it's that THE MAN KILLED YOUR MOTHER! WHY ARE YOU JOKING AROUND?! (The searching for tape bit was amazing)

At the end of the day I just feel disappointed. I feel so very sad that a lot of the emotions were merely fabricated and that the actors showed almost non of it. This could be Chris Pratt's worst acting as he only shows actual grief and emotion (the Gamora fight scene was so damn fabricated) when Yundu died (and I'm sorry, I could not cry. I never bought their relationship since I never saw it. They were together in this movie for a total of three scenes and barely spoke to the other. And no, just saying that they had a Father-son relationship is not enough for me)

In the end, I just felt sad. And no, I don't feel better than anyone for not liking it, but I'm the kind of person that when sees some problem (to me, at least) I can't really enjoy the movie. In fact, I felt that Deadpool was OK. But Logan was awesome sauce. Anyways, feel free to respond.

Any time the movie tried to get serious, I got bored because there really wasn't a lot of substance. It was almost predictable. The pacing felt weird at times too. And visuals wise, the previous movie was better looking.

The big fight at the end with Ego didn't need them to be around... it essentially prolongs the conflict with a ton of chaos. Said chaos could have instead been made by the planet attacking the Guardians, rather than of Space Invaders while also attacking Ego.

To be fair though... they're not the only characters thrown in for the sake of introducing them to the MCU. Stallone and the other Ravagers had one/two scenes, at best... Think Gunn was just too excited at the fact that GotG took off, and they greenlit him to start whipping up tons more stuff.

Even at the end with Father and Son, which is a great Cat Stevens song, it just felt too on the nose. Plus that song is really emotional and I didn't feel like the film really built up the relationship between Chris Pratt and his father all that well, so it didn't really work.

Just to be clear, Father and Son wasn't supposed to be referencing Peter and Ego. It was referencing Peter and Yondu (with some added resonance for the relationship between Yondu and Rocket).  Despite the very small amount of direct contact Peter and Yondu had in this movie, their relationship was fleshed out a lot in this movie, but only if you take it in the context of the first one.  It's silly to jump into the middle of a series and then say that there was no buildup or development to the character relationships--there was plenty of development, it's just spread across multiple installments.

dhfauio,"3 - He can't create life, he can only manipulate the material of his planet. So no, he can't create a realistic photograph or hologram because, and probably wouldn't since he's not human. He used the materials he had on his planet to create those scenes to explain to Peter.

5 - He shouldn't be menacing, at least not overtly. Ego is an emotionally abusive, manipulative father. He's handsome and charismatic and you really want to believe he wants to be a good father to you... but in the end all he has to offer is more heartache and pain.

10 - Because he doesn't process emotion like humans do. He was close to Meredith, but in the end she was just a tool. He's a celestial, not a human. He likely didn't think Peter was as human as he was emotionally. If he heard it from Mantis, he might not believed it. But to hear the truth so coldly, so callously, from the man he **wanted** to be his father, that gave him the conviction to fight.",69by9z
dhf5359,"One second the movie was looney tunes, the next it was ultra violent.  That was pretty weird.  Twisted in a way that's a little creepy.",69by9z
dhf980x,"1. It's a sci-fi film in 2017 of course there's going to be a lot of CGI. It wasn't done poorly so I don't get your complaint. There was just too much for you?

2. It's a comic book movie. They're comic book heroes. Also you see Nebula get fucked up and have to shift her bones back, she blocked the explosion from Gamora who still felt the repercussions of it. Quill was beat to shit by the end of it, and he was part immortal. Drax is extremely durable. It's on point with first film, so if you saw the first one I don't know why you would expect anything different in this one. 

3. It's called being creative. And the whole damn movie is a huge 70's/80's nostalgia so why would that be problem? The first one is too!

4. Again it's an 70's/80's throwback! Plus he already mentioned he would make Pacman and other weird shit when he first learned he could harness the power, so that fits in with continuity. The whole theater laughed when I saw, so I'd say it hit it's mark. But your entitled to not find it funny.

5. You're right he wasn't menacing, because he didn't believe he was a villain. And I don't agree, because as soon as he appeared on screen there was nuanced tension waiting for the other shoe to drop. Quill was wary of him, then when he came around, Gamora was wary of him and we were set up with suspicion from Mantis by this point. I agree it felt rushed, but it's forgivable and still easy to enjoy.

6. They gave Drax moments weakness and strength. Weakness when Mantis touches him when he's thinking of his family and she starts to sob and feel real sadness portraying his emotions. And strength when he attaches the cable to himself and jumps out of the ship to shoot at the sovereign ship. But yes he is the comic relief, he was in the first one as well! Having a comic relief is pretty much par for ensemble action/adventure film.

7. Seriously? There's better stuff to complain or give a shit about. It gets done all the time with females, why not with more males? Stop hating the human body or being jealous of someone else's care for their own. It didn't cheapen the scene or take away from the film and there was just literally one fucking scene of it in the whole movie. You're just complaining to complain.

8. It's Yondu! If you're going to bitch you should at least pay attention. Did he nearly kill Quill or was he just being a hardass on him and was just going to let him go...at least that's what his crew had complained about. If you pay attention it's all explained. It was explained that he believed or at least chose to believe that Ego wasn't hurting the children, he was blinded by the money. He was then trying to redeem himself, so no you're not supposed to forget about the children, but you're supposed to acknowledge his redemption. His character was badass in both films. 

9. You have no idea how multi-picture contracts and SAG rules work. I love that Vin did the voice of Baby Groot as well. 

10. It was to show what he felt was necessary and important to his cause. He didn't want to her die, but he knew his place was in the sea and couldn't be distracted from it. It seemed more like an attempt to get Peter to understand the gravity of his ""purpose"" rather than turn against Ego. He's was trying to convey the sacrifice he had to make to get where he is, and that Peter would have to sacrifice his friends to fully obtain the power. ",69by9z
dhfjw28,"1 - 2 : A matter of taste, sorry you didn't like it.

3 - I think Ego couldn't create ""life"". He's a very powerful being, but not literally a god

4 - Besides the joke, I think it empathyses the difference between father and son. This celestial power comes from inside them, so Ego turns into a bigger figure of himself, and Peter in some earth pop culture icon (we already know he has a soft spot for earth stuff). Still is pretty weird and I understand you didn't like that.

5 - I think the ""menacing"" thing was him attempting to destroy/recreate himself in all the seeded planets, not killing kids. - I foung Ego quite interesting, I'm not sure even if he was a ""villain"". I mean, sure what he did to his children was ""wrong"", but he regarded mortals as we may regard bugs (he felt himself so above it all he didn't consider killing a bunch of non-celestial kids ""wrong"", as people don't feel bad for killing a bug).

6 - Partially agree with you. I actually liked the continuation of his deal, the most touching moment for me was when Mantis touches him when he's remembering his daughter. I would have liked more action scenes for him.

7 - Sorry for Chris's hard work, but as a woman... I didn't notice lol

8 - Ego said he hid to Yondu that he murdered those kids, and Yondu said once he discovered what Ego did he decided not to deliver Peter. More, his crew considering he was ""soft"" on Peter triggered the mutiny (he didn't fall for Peter's trick, he let him escape with the power stone in the first movie) 

9 - Uh... ok

10 - Ego is not empathic by definition. Once he revealed Peter his heritage, he was convinced he would understand their purpose was beyond his mortal part (including his mother). Like Peter, I think Ego really loved Peter's mother and it was really hard for him to have to kill her to pursue his ""purpose"". He was just expressing himself.",69by9z

7. Yes.

8. Eh.

9. Is that really an issue?

10. Ego isn't human. He doesn't understand why it's a big deal and likely didn't think Peter would make a big deal out of it. Peter had by this point accepted his friends would end up dead, that's how influenced he was. ",69by9z

It's as if there was just ""funny scene"" then ""not funny scene"" with little overlap.

Regarding the third act: [I thought Ego's turn was way too abrupt and sudden.  They could've played him more like he didn't see how vile his actions where, like he had such a grander scheme in mind and just couldn't be concerned with the affairs of lesser beings, but instead they just made him a mustache-twirling villain who suddenly had been secretly evil the whole time, which I thought diluted his character tremendously.](#spoiler)",69by9z

Most of the characters had fuck all to do the whole movie. The main Ego narrative can essentially boil down to 3 scenes and his development was poor.

dhdi02v,"some spoilers below:

1. Ego tells Peter that he told Yondu he wasn't going to hurt the kids, which assuaged Yondu because he was being paid a lot of money and if anything bad was happening he wouldn't want to know anyway. When it became obvious to Yondu what was happening, he stopped and kept Peter. Yondu's definitely not blameless as Stallone and he himself are the first to admit. But he didn't knowingly send those kids to their death.

2. Ego isn't a god. He's just a really powerful being. Peter was able to hold him off for a bit because he was using his powers more efficiently (using his heart instead of his head), which evened out the fact that he had much less experience. It's a hokey explanation, but at least it beats him just randomly being really good with his new powers.

3. His motivation was that he viewed himself as the pinnacle of life. He was disappointed in mortal life and figured everything should be like him.

4. Agree that it would have been better to have Ego be less of a galactic threat (although keep in mind he's seeded thousands of planets, but that's only a fraction of the galaxy probably, much less the universe). The script did a good job of making this a more intimate story, and I thought making the threat so big again kind of messed with that a bit.

5. Also agree that there were a few tonal misplays. But that's true of literally every Marvel movie. It's a flaw, but of all the MCU franchises, GotG is the one I'm most forgiving of for shoe-horned comedy, since it's very much meant as a less serious, more surreal experience. It irritates me much more when Iron Man deals with serious issues like PTSD and refugee crises, in a much more realistic environment on earth, but then starts throwing quips like he's doing stand-up.

6. The one thing I absolutely can't get on board with is saying that Ronan was more unique or better as a bad guy in any way. Forgetting the fact that the villain in this movie is as unique as can possibly be (he's a freaking planet!), Ronan was so boring and cliched. Just a big blue guy whose dialogue is pretty much a copy/paste of every terrible world-destroying villain in the MCU before him.",69by9z
dheiisf,"> unique bad guy like the previous film

I was with ya up until this, unique bad guy? Are you kidding? The first movie had notoriously the most generic dumb-ass bad guy in possibly the last five years of Marvel movies.

If anything, what the movie needed was a little confirmation that peter was buying what ego was selling.  It just seems like ego told peter the truth before peter seemed to be agreeing to anything.

The only weak point was Nebula vs Gamora.  I feel they never really set nebula up right.

dhadw7s,"The more I think about it, the more I believe that  you can rehabilitate almost all of my criticisms by making Rocket Racoon the main character.  For example:
    [Keep the main plot line up until they are pursued by The Sovereign fleet.  Replace Ego with some mysterious figure who destroys the fleet in an instant, then guides them to some safe planet but disappears.  The group can still be split up by having Starlord, Gamora, and Drax decide to search the planet for the mysterious figure, but insisting that Rocket stay behind to guard the ship because he's too unpredictable after the battery thing.  Since Ego isn't in the picture, now you can use this time to show some on-screen chemistry between Starlord and Gamora (showing the audience, rather than telling them, that there's some ""unspoken thing"" between them).  Have them get captured by some un-named group.  Concurrently have the Ravagers/Rocket/Nebula plot unfold almost exactly as it does.] (#spoiler)


[Reveal that the mysterious force is basically a clone or robot army.  Introduce Mantis in basically her same form, so you can have all of her and Drax's interactions.  The head of the army (call them Dr. X) wants to woo the guardians to his/her side so they are treated well (although maybe have a little ominous foreshadowing here).  Maybe their stated goal is sort of the opposite of the Sovereign (which keeps them in play nicely).  Dr. X states that they want to use genetic engineering to equalize the universe and give injured people a second chance at life (think Lady Eboshi from Princess Mononoke).  The Guardians are on-board with this (although, conspicuously, Rocket isn't there).  Bring in Nebula as before, have her and Gamora fight it out except include Starlord in the mix.  Put him in as a peace-broker between the two.  He knows how hard it is to grow up without family, so he's in a good a place to faciliate these two sisters trying to reforge a bond they used to share.  This gives us another great place to actually GROW the relationship between him and Gamora, instead of just telling us that it's there.  Have Nebula escape at the last second, but she's clearly conflicted about Gamora.] (#spoiler)

[Reintroduce Rocket and Yondo after they've done the whole mutineer-killing thing.  Rocket, having been the unwilling subject of genetic experiments, is freaked out by Dr. X's whole thing and believes its wrong, throw in some fun bio-ethics stuff (like if Dr. X is so generous with their science, why do they make their patients fight in the army in exchange for treatment?).  End this with a deeper schism between him and the rest of the crew and he storms off.  Put Yondo and Starlord together now, play up their father-son thing and have him be the one to help Starlord understand what's going on with Rocket.] (#spoiler)

[Put a little more character-building filler in; maye some Drax/Mantis scenes (particularly the ones where he talks about his past), a little more Starlod/Gamora (have them talk mostly about Rocket and their concerns with him) and then have Starlord go off to find Rocket and apologize.  Bring in Nebula to kill Gamora one last time (this time without Starlord interfering), leading to them discovering the *dark secret* of Dr. X; they are actually conducting experiments on unwilling creatures to recreate an army of Rocket Racoons (or something similiar) that they will use to FORCE people into genetic manipulation (basically trying to recreate and replace the Sovereign).   Similarly Mantis warns Drax that they are in danger (in my version she's a genetic creation, rather than a slave, but otherwise basically the same).  At the same time Starlord is trying to reconcile while with Rocket, when they both get attacked and Rocket is taken to be reverse-engineered (maybe his body holds some crucial secret that's the last piece in Dr. X's plan).  Maybe have The Sovereign reveal that they know about Dr. X and have been in rivalry with them for a long time.  Maybe they mistakenly believe that The Guardians stole the batteries because they're actually in cahoots together, so they go off to get further involved.] (#spoiler)

[Put the team through some peril (now featuring Yondo and Nebula), 
 and have them rescue Rocket together at the last second (who is re-experiencing his own former experiment trauma, leading to some nice catharsis), and then replace the planet-fighting scene with a gigantic clone-soldier production plant/moon or something.  That leaves all the same opportunities for gags and basically the same type of colossal, world-consuming combat (plus the whole Groot/bomb thing, because now they have to blow up the production plant's core, instead of Ego's).  Finish the movie in basically the same way, with Rocket re-asserting his own uniqueness, and also coming to understand that the team DOES in fact love him and want him in their family.  He feels more in control of his own identity, and all the other ancilliary relationships (Starlord/Yondo, Starlord/Gamora, Gamora/Nebula, Drax/Mantis) have had the same amount of or more on-screen time to develop and grow.  The themes are the same (the importance of family), without having to blow the big secret of Starlord's heritage and his father and all that.  Plus Yondo can still die at the very end, driving that point home for Starlord and forging a REALLY tight bond between him and Rocket (because they both felt close to Yondo towards the end there).] (#spoiler)

That's my two cents, anyways.

dhazlnl,"I liked the relationship, it paralleled his fathers except they split at the ends. Both of them slept around with multiple women only to fall for a special woman. However where Ego decides to continue being... well... egotistic and decides to continue being a god without being tied down, Quill stays with, and fights for, Gamora.


I think every character that splits from the group and pairs up were enhanced with this. Gamora and Nebula with their family and father issues. Peter and his Father and the way with women, family, ego. Mantis and Drax, one that doesn't express emotion (except for the semi mask of humour and anger) and one that reads emotion (that scene with Mantis and Drax about his family was truly touching. To see and feel Drax's emotions, raw and expressed. Rocket mirroring Yondu. Groot emphasizing the family dynamic by being an infant. Yondu and Quill vs Quill and Ego in terms of a father who was there and one that wasn't. Etc etc.



Also, I commented somewhere else but:


**MAJOR SPOILERS BUT THIS IS A SPOILER DISCUSSION SO**

To Ego he is a god (lowercase g) and he see's other lifeforms as insignificant. Since Quill is part god, he believed that Quill would think the same way as well. In some way, his immortality lead to his demise through his naivety in believing that his son would also disregard his mother the same way he was able to.


He loved her, but was incapable of understanding or at least accepting his love for something so inferior. In order to prevent this he killed her. He believed that he was better than every form of life and was disappointment in what he found.


The only way he could fulfill what he believes is his purpose (to find other life and connect) was to irradiate and replace all life with something equal to himself. Which to him, doesn't exist, so he decided to become all life.


Ego believed that Quill would side with him as he was a part of him in some sense.


Also it is possible that Ego wanted to show that while Quill will need to sacrifice his friends for his version of the ""greater good"" Ego shows that he also had to sacrifice by killing his one true love as well.",69by9z

It's one of the challenges of sequels and I think a perfectly valid critique of Guardians 2. It did pretty much everything right and was a lot of fun and I laughed and had a good time, but it did retread a good amount of the first movie in tone and pacing and the comedy did come close to or outright slip into *parody* a few times too many. (One example: The recurring gag with the unripe fruit was *great* until Nebula took a bite and said ""ew! it's unripe!"". That joke would have landed so much better if she'd taken a bite, scowled a bit, but didn't say anything since it was already so well setup the punchline would have been obvious)

The more I think about Vol2 the more I think it was really a 1.5 type of movie. A *proper* sequel would have involved a continuation of events from the first movie. But because of how MCU is structured, those events are being withheld until Phase 3/Infinity War. While Quill finding out more about his origins is relevant, it's a relatively minor story compared and when the main *juice* of Guardians is exactly that they *all* have interesting backgrounds and they *all* have interesting stories, it somewhat diffuses the importance of focusing on any one of them. Or rather, put another way, this entire movie *could* have basically been a short film and still done its job story-wise. 

Like you could just as easily have a 6-8 part miniseries or TV show that dealt with stories like this one. A 'proper' sequel 'should' have dealt with the bigger picture of things. ",69by9z

For those who know his backstory in the comics (which they're mostly staying with as far as I can tell), it's a lot more tragic.",69by9z

dhcc8so,"Interesting point, but it just wouldn't be right to kill off Drax before he gets his revenge on Thanos.",69by9z
dhcby3m,"yeah I definitely disagree. I don't think that would have had nearly as much of an emotional impact. Drax wants to be reunited with his wife and daughter, he just really wants to kill Thanos first, I feel like when he dies it will be comforting knowing that he is reunited with his family again. The emotion comes from the father/son bond between Quill and Yondu as well as Rockets newfound attachment. I completely agree with Yondu being more visually appealing but Yondus death hit me like a punch to the gut, and the subsequent redemption by the Ravegers just made it all the more meaningful. I cant say I would have felt the same if Drax bit it. Yondus sacrifice was the most emotionally impactful final 15 min of any MCU movie for me, I just cant see how Drax being the one to die would come close to being more emotional than that.",69by9z
dhcpy58,"Drax felt like he was kept on the backburner the whole film and only pulled into the front for some humor.

dh6tad3,"GOTG pretty much set the standard for wise-cracking rock soundtrack integrated into superhero flicks that have since been copped pretty hard, and at least it's implemented into a story element and not there for the sake of being there, which can't be said for other movies that have ripped it off(Suicide Squad).

To GOTG2's credit they didn't rely on really *anything* from the first film like obnoxious callbacks, more dance-offs, recycled jokes in bad taste, or previously used songs. 

Baby Groot is a totally new take on a character you already know, and his lack of understanding is not only entertaining, but then is used to subvert your expectations when he remembers what button to press. 

You knew Drax in the first film and now that he's grown comfortable around the crew, he's much more active and talky, and part of the joke *is* how obnoxious he is, and the characters in the film are visibly annoyed with his behavior.

I suppose snappy dialogue is just going to be a signature of a writer/director. The same can be said for many other writer/directors that they maintain a signature tone in their scripts. You can argue and say you're not a fan of it being that way, but the script itself is still impressively well written and witty, despite it not being your cup of tea. As for colors, I suppose that's just a thing of personal opinion. I like it as it sets it apart from other space operas.

Not really sure how Ego is a bad villain, his motives are incredibly clear, his character is developed and you emphasize with him just long enough that even when you realize he's a total piece of shit a part of you is a little sad to see him crumble to dust. 

A main character dies as a result of actions on the planet, as a result from a enemy who actually has stake-free consequences in the story, as they're not actually in their ships. 

I digress, it is your opinion and you're welcomed to have it, but it's a tough call to say this movie wasn't a well made flick, even if it wasn't your personal cup of tea. 

Personally to me it's the best since GOTG, but not better than it. (GOTG - 9/10, AoU - 6/10, Ant Man - 6.5/10, Dr. Strange - 5.5/10, GOTG2 - 7.5/10, including Fox i'd also add Deadpool - 7/10, XM:AoA - 1/10, Logan - 9/10)",69by9z

Most of her body has been replaced with metal parts by thanos and even parts of her head so most likely parts of her brain, so her lines are delivered more robotically and stiff you can even hear a slight metallic sound to her voice as if coming out of a shitty speaker.

I think there's only so much hand-to-hand combat you can do in a space opera. 

I think Nebula and Mantis' inclusion are fine and did their own beats in helping develop Gamora's & Drax' character arcs, while also keeping them onscreen long enough to familiarize audiences to them since they're playing key roles moving forward. Yondu got his own and even helped provide some depth to Rocket's. 

> the spaceship battles can only be interesting for so long

I'll just have to respectfully disagree. The movie's a space opera after all. If you find hand-to-hand combat more interesting in a movie where aliens, lasers and space battles are the norm, I think you'll have to adjust your expectations. ",69by9z

Again the Gamorra and Nebula thing was completely random, all they seemed to want to do with Nebula was get from point A to point B with her, point B being the Thanos Avengers movie.

Aside from Rocket having the exact same emotional meltdown in both movies, his character was really entertaining in the middle of the movie. The start, not so much, as for some reason I felt he was given Drax's inability to understand colloquialisms for no reason when in the first one he was quite witty and clever, and we also know from him stealing the batteries and his traps in the forest that he's really cunning so I really didn't dig his lines in the meeting with the golden dudes and around those general scenes where he plays the idiot.

My main gripe is how basic the plot is though. I know it's not supposed to be a thriller with a massively convoluted story line or anything but stop me if you've heard this before: Protagonist doesn't know his father, said father turns up when the protagonist gets in trouble, they have this big bonding sesh then they discover oh no he was evil all along.

Peter was well on board for the genocide of all life in the galaxy, he even commented to say it was beautiful, but then Ego tells him he killed him mum??????

2) Gamora : Abusive father.  Forced to fight sister as father basically wants the perfect children for his plans.  Strives to simply escape.  Has come to the conclusion that she cant let her father do to others what he did to her.

3) Nebula : Same as Gamora.  Instead of escaping, seeks to finally beat Gamora to prove to herself that it was all worth it.  Plans to kill father instead of protecting others from him.

4) Rocket : Created in a lab.  We dont have much on Rocket, but we know that his ""Father Figure"" definitely didnt care about him.  ""I didnt ask to be made!"" may be one of the best lines from the first movie.  Responds by trying to push others away out of fear.

> Why were half the Ravagers expelled into space? I don't remember half of them fighting back over Taserfaces takeover. 

Mutinies are times to settle old grudges and grievances.  The people who got thrown in the airlock were either on Yondu's side, or weren't sufficiently on Taserface's side to protect themselves from having grudges settled against them.

> So what happened to Ego's blue goo extension-of-himself seedlings on all those planets? Did they just go away? Are they still there? He needed Peter to help activate them, but they just stopped growing when they disconnected. 

I'm not sure, but I think they just kind of die off.  They were living extensions of Ego, but they all were linked back to Ego.  Without Ego at the helm, I think they'll end up like a regular body without a brain - slowly withering away and dieing.

> If Yondu was actually such a kind soul why did he hand over the dozens of other children to Ego to die? He had to have guessed something was up long before Peter came along. 

Either Yondu isn't the sharpest tool in the shed, or his greed was slowly overcome by his concern for the ravager code and what was happening to those children.  You don't get to be a captain of a space ship, let a lone a Ravager captain without some degree of smarts, so I suspect that it was more his sense of greed being overcome by guilt over time.  Quill just happened to be the breaking point.

Apparently sisterly bonds are formed through beating each other half to death.  That or she was motivated by the thought of the millions of units in bounties that Nebula is worth, your call.

> Was it me or was Nebula dialed back from how angry and dangerous she was in the first film? She lets the Ravagers take her. She ""asks"" for a spaceship from Kraglin instead of just taking one.

Yes.  She's had some time to reflect on her own existence without Daddy always watching over her, and I think that there's been some realization that some times you can get what you want by asking nicely instead of just murdering everyone in your way.  In the first film she had always been kept on a short leash and was in every way just an extension of Thanos' will.  By the time the second film rolls around she's been cut loose and that's changed her a bit.

> What was Mantis's connection with Ego? He kept her around to soothe him / lull him to sleep? Even though she could stall his planetary core attack but still keep them flying in a space pod he materialized during consciousness? Was she one of his ""failed"" children he was disposing of?

Mantis was a pet that happened to have a useful trick.  I don't think she was one of his progeny, more just a fascinating little distraction for a being that was so disappointed with what he found in the wider universe.

> How did Baby Groot just get over his learning disability and hit the right buttons on the bomb? Same with him standing up to the ravagers - he couldn't put up a fight with them, but then he was able to extend his roots and kill one on the walkway above?

You got me.  Heroic moment? ""Do the opposite of what Rocket said to do"" ?  As for the ravager, we've seen before that he gets stronger when he gets angry, kinda hulk-esque in that manner.  He was more scared than angry before, but when they were getting the hell out of dodge, he was properly pissed enough to be able to take on a full size person.

> I thought the Celestials were supposed to be humongous planet-sized beings like the one turned into the Knowhere mining colony, but Ego's brain was the size of a small building.

Ego I think was sort of the runt celestial.  He came into being alone without the others and I *think* after the other bigger and badder celestials died off.  On the other hand, if he'd managed his scheme he would've been the biggest and baddest celestial.  Maybe this is the celestial life cycle? Start out as a small moon then add planets to your mass until you're big enough to properly put the fear of god into everyone else.

> Why were all the sets circular? The Obelisk Portal, The Sovereign Throne Room, Ego's Throne . . .

Not real sure on this one.  I know circles and curves are usually used to denote organic forms, but the portal and the throne room weren't very organic.  Might have been some sort of symbolism about how life goes in circles?  Or could've been some sort of call back to Jack Kirby art; couple of the scenes had very strong Kirby feels to them and in my recollection Jack Kirby really liked his curves and circles.

> Where was Glenn Close? She was credited but I did not spot her.

Far less than half, the lot we see rebel are meant to be a representational amount of the crew.

Still there, the state would depend on GotG vol.3's plot.

Even in the first one she was trying to get Nebula to switch sides against Thanos, she was  defending herself the rest of the time.

I don't think she is.
",69by9z
dh5qc2z,"These might not all be right but here's my understanding:
&nbsp;

1. Ego had been searching for Peter since the incident with Ronan. Since they had become ""The Guardians"", there might have been news they'd been hired by the Sovereign so Ego went there to find him. Also, I don't think there was a gun on the ship, it was just Ego firing pure energy from his avatar.
2. This was a little awkward since Peter made a reference that nobody else would even get, but he makes a lot of those. It might have just been one of those times like when you fight with your friends and call them something dumb they don't understand. It can just be an extra thing to mock them for. That being said, I wasn't a huge fan of Rocket and Peter's interaction in a lot of the movie.
3. They might not have fought in the woods but were likely still loyal to the captain and regretted it. Kraglin obviously did but since he had spoken out at the woods, he was likely safe.
4. Since the blue goo was just an expansion of his ""light"" core, since everything else crumpled when he died, I'd be willing to bet the goo on all the planets dissolved as well.
5. Not necessarily about him being a kind soul. The Ravagers still kill and steal. The only rule they mention is not trafficking in kids. Yondu says he was young, greedy, and stupid. Once he realized it was happening, he accepted exile, took Peter, and hid him from Ego. Was it stated Yondu was the only person delivering kids?
6. (also 7) In the last movie, Gamora had the same thing and didn't want to kill Nebula, trying to save her but Nebula ripped her hand off to escape. It seemed weird that it came back with Gamora hating Nebula and Nebula being more passive in a lot of scenes.
8. He probably found her on one of the planets where he left a descendant and took her in because of her abilities. I don't think he ever considered her stronger than just the low level empathy she showed at first. It might just be that his human avatar being gone for so long might make the planet form suffer (implied by him needing to return). The sleep might help stave off that danger.
9. I don't think it was a learning disability, Groot is more just a dumb, selfish kid in this movie. He could easily just randomly remember Rocket telling him not to press the button or it might be because the other button was cracked, not sure. Also, in the first movie, Groot could kill and fight back but only once did he spear dudes and whip them around like crazy. He might just need to be extra emotional for it. If he attacked them while they were in a group, they might've just smashed him.
10. I think this might just be a difference between comic universe and cinematic universe. Knowhere and the one Celestial they show wielding the Infinity Stone are the only other 2 we have seen. They're both huge but might not be the rule for cinematic. It might be more about power than size.
11. No idea. I hadn't even really considered that.
12. She might have been in one of the 5 end scenes? I didn't stay for all of them but I also don't know where she was.",69by9z
dh5q4pj,">How did Ego know where to find Peter in that save-the-day deus ex machina moment? And was that Ego manning the gun atop the ship as the ""tiny spaceman""?

The events of GOTG2 occurs only about 4 months after the 1st movie. Ego mentions about hearing about The Guardians Of The Galaxy and about a human who held an infinity stone and survived and guess that StarLord might be his son. So he went in search of the GOTG. He must have heard that the GOTG got hired to do a job by the Sovereign and went there in search of them.

>Why did Peter genuinely enjoy calling Rocket a Trash Panda? He was angry with Rocket for causing their predicament, sure, but he knows Rocket hurts being belittled down to basic animals, and seemed to have an out-of-character moment happily smirking that it was a worse insult.

Not out of character since PQ likes cracking jokes. He knows RR doesn't get it when he insulted him. Just like he knew Yondu doesn't know who Mary Poppins is when PQ said he looked like Mary Poppins when they were descending down by his arrow.

>If Yondu was actually such a kind soul why did he hand over the dozens of other children to Ego to die? He had to have guessed something was up long before Peter came along.

This was addressed when Yondu meets up with Stakar/Starhawk(Sylvester Stallone's character) and Starhawk banishes him from the Ravagers for 'dealing with kids'. Yondu says that he never knew what Ego did with the kids but once he realised what happened to the kids, he didn't deliver Peter Quill.

>So what happened to Ego's blue goo extension-of-himself seedlings on all those planets? Did they just go away? Are they still there? He needed Peter to help activate them, but they just stopped growing when they disconnected.

No idea, think that's a plot hole.

>Why were half the Ravagers expelled into space? I don't remember half of them fighting back over Taserfaces takeover.

Not half the crew got expelled. Just the ones that were loyal to Yondu were expelled into space. We saw maybe 10 bodies in that scene and there are way more Ravager crews.

>Did I miss a plot point where something happened to help convince Gamora to be more lenient / sympathetic toward Nebula? She had the chance to stop her / kill her in a cliche close-quarters-combat scene but didn't take the opportunity, instead opting for leniency. What gave her a last-second change of heart?

They always fought when they were young, and Gamora always won against Nebula. She thought that Nebula would back down after Gamora spared her life and saved her. Nebula can always repair herself(well, to an extent) 

>Was it me or was Nebula dialed back from how angry and dangerous she was in the first film? She lets the Ravagers take her. She ""asks"" for a spaceship from Kraglin instead of just taking one.

She doesn't let them take her. She says in the movie that she's the daughter of Thanos and can  take all of them down if she wanted to. Ravagers were basically scared of her(If you heard, one of them whispers to each other saying that shes the daughter of Thanos, so they were also scared of Thanos).

>What was Mantis's connection with Ego? He kept her around to soothe him / lull him to sleep? Even though she could stall his planetary core attack but still keep them flying in a space pod he materialized during consciousness? Was she one of his ""failed"" children he was disposing of?

Think it was mentioned that Ego kept her or took her from infancy from one of the planets he's explored because of her unique powers to help him sleep. That's it.

>How did Baby Groot just get over his learning disability and hit the right buttons on the bomb? Same with him standing up to the ravagers - he couldn't put up a fight with them, but then he was able to extend his roots and kill one on the walkway above?

He's a baby, not learning disability. He's just slower to learn, just like a baby. And about fighting all of them? Guess state of mind and pressure? 

>I thought the Celestials were supposed to be humongous planet-sized beings like the one turned into the Knowhere mining colony, but Ego's brain was the size of a small building.

Celestials aren't about size but power. Celestials can be as small as anything, but what makes them Celestials is the amount of power they have. Ego can create stuff from molecules.

>Why were all the sets circular? The Obelisk Portal, The Sovereign Throne Room, Ego's Throne . . 

Heh, no idea. Maybe because The Sovereign are obsessed with perfection and the spherical shapes are perfection? Or the set designers lack imagination. 

>Where was Glenn Close? She was credited but I did not spot her.

Maybe deleted scene. They did mention Nova Prime in the movie, Yondu mentions them that the reason they're letting the GOTG go is that he doesn't want Nova Prime coming after them.",69by9z
dh5q8ej,"Here are my answers (mostly guesswork) to your questions:

> How did Ego know where to find Peter in that save-the-day deus ex machina moment? And was that Ego manning the gun atop the ship as the ""tiny spaceman""?

The Guardians became rather famous after the events of the first movie, so they probably weren't hard to find. I suspect that Ego found them shortly afterwards and was biding his time to find the right moment to introduce himself to Peter. You have to admit that saving him from certain death was a dramatic entrance.

> Why did Peter genuinely enjoy calling Rocket a Trash Panda? He was angry with Rocket for causing their predicament, sure, but he knows Rocket hurts being belittled down to basic animals, and seemed to have an out-of-character moment happily smirking that it was a worse insult.

Both of them were fired up at the moment and angry with each other. When emotions are flaring like that, it's easy to do something without regards to others' feelings.

> Why were half the Ravagers expelled into space? I don't remember half of them fighting back over Taserfaces takeover.

Maybe there were more of them who stayed on the ship.

> So what happened to Ego's blue goo extension-of-himself seedlings on all those planets? Did they just go away? Are they still there? He needed Peter to help activate them, but they just stopped growing when they disconnected.

Probably still there but no longer functional. Whenever Peter disconnected from Ego, they stopped growing, so they probably need both Ego and Peter to work. With the connection gone, I doubt they pose a threat.

> If Yondu was actually such a kind soul why did he hand over the dozens of other children to Ego to die? He had to have guessed something was up long before Peter came along.

Yondu was a space pirate. Pirates aren't good people, but there's still an honor among them with lines that they won't cross. He said that he didn't know that Ego was killing the children, and that's probably true at first. Either he realized it after kidnapping Peter, or he figured it out sooner and just took a liking to Peter that made him reluctant to hand him over to Ego like he did the others.

> Did I miss a plot point where something happened to help convince Gamora to be more lenient / sympathetic toward Nebula? She had the chance to stop her / kill her in a cliche close-quarters-combat scene but didn't take the opportunity, instead opting for leniency. What gave her a last-second change of heart?

I'm not certain about that. The only thing I can think of is that being around Peter changed her and made her more sympathetic to the concept of family, so when she actually had the chance to kill Nebula, she realized that she couldn't do it.

> Was it me or was Nebula dialed back from how angry and dangerous she was in the first film? She lets the Ravagers take her. She ""asks"" for a spaceship from Kraglin instead of just taking one.

She had just been imprisoned by the Guardians and barely survived a crash. She probably wanted a break and didn't see any reason to get violent with the Ravagers when they were willing to do what she wanted anyway.

> What was Mantis's connection with Ego? He kept her around to soothe him / lull him to sleep? Even though she could stall his planetary core attack but still keep them flying in a space pod he materialized during consciousness? Was she one of his ""failed"" children he was disposing of?

I could be wrong, but I don't think that she was one of Ego's children. Drax describes her as a pet, and I think that's all she was to Ego. It was nice to have her around to help him sleep, but she didn't have any value to him. If she died, he would probably just find another orphan of her species to replace her.

> How did Baby Groot just get over his learning disability and hit the right buttons on the bomb? Same with him standing up to the ravagers - he couldn't put up a fight with them, but then he was able to extend his roots and kill one on the walkway above?

He couldn't fight a whole group of Ravagers, but he could take on one, especially when that Ravager wasn't going to fight back when everyone around him was getting arrowed by Yondu. As for the bomb, that might just be a moment of growing up for Groot.

> I thought the Celestials were supposed to be humongous planet-sized beings like the one turned into the Knowhere mining colony, but Ego's brain was the size of a small building.

We don't know much about the Celestials in the MCU. In the comics, there are lots of different types of Celestials with many different appearances, so the MCU Celestials might be similar. Their godlike DNA means that they don't necessarily look alike and may come in different sizes. Alternately, Ego might be younger and smaller than the Celestial that made Knowhere.

> Why were all the sets circular? The Obelisk Portal, The Sovereign Throne Room, Ego's Throne . . .

Planets are circular. (Technically oblate spheroids, but they look circular on a flat screen.) The circular set designs might be references to Ego being a planet. This is really just a random guess.

> Where was Glenn Close? She was credited but I did not spot her.

I don't think she was in it. Either her scenes were cut, or she was credited for contractual reasons.",69by9z
dh5reni,"1. father started searching for quill after the events of the first movie.  Quill was obviously contacted by someone to do the job at the gold battery planet, so it stands to reason that Father quill either found out about it or asked whoever gives the gaurdians jobs where teh gaurdians could be found.... short answer space-kreigslist... other answer: plot.

2. we saw some resist the mutiny in the forrest, and there was likely more resistance offscreen. in total i only saw 5-6 ravagers floating in space though and there were at least 5-6 defending yondu in the forrest. dont know why you think half of them died they never said so.

3. the blue goo is probably still there, just like the shattered remains of Ergo the living planet are still there. ergo just controlled matter with his power, he didnt create it.  sooo.... that is probably that.... unless we hear otherwise later.

4. Yondu wasnt a kind soul. he was a greedy theif who took bad jobs and hurt alot of people and over time began to regret it.  when he stole quill he really really regreted it and by that time had found out what ergo was doing.  he was never a kind person, never good. but he wasnt all evil. the point of his story is that redemption is never too far off, he couldnt fix what he did or undo the bridges he burned. he couldn't save the people who's deaths are his fault. but he could save one person worth saving.  his old friends would never accept or forgive him in life, they still didn't forgive him when he was dead. But his last act was a good one, he last sacrifice was worthy of praise.  The ravagers celebrated the man Yondu could have been, the man that he once was. The man who yondu became again when he saved quill.  it is a redemption story bro. darth vader was not a good guy either, but his last act was a good one.

5. Nebula didnt hate Gamora, she hated her father, and she didnt really understand that herself until she was about to kill gamora. Gamora fought Nebula as kids so that she could survive, and Nebula fought Gamora so she could survive.  Both desperate to avoid the wroth of thanos. Every time Nebula lost a battle against Gamora, Thanos would chop her up and try to make her better. but in the fight in this movie that was not going to happen, Nebula realized that she had no reason to fight, no reason to kill.  when nebula was about to win, she found that she had achived what she really wanted, she won, one time, she salvaged some small shard of shattered pride and that done all that was left was killing thanos... i donno i quite liked it.  

6. Nebula was a murderous psycopath in GOTG 1 because thanos and Ronin were breathing down her neck, she was terrified for her life. since then she has been on the run, alone, no thanos, no constant threat of death, freedom. Nebula was free, and her sister Gamora was free, Nebula had seen Gamora defy thanos and live. She saw Gamora build a family that loves and cares for her. Nebula saw the possibility, however slight, to have her own life.  She is not just a thing, not a tool for killing, she is clawing back some of her sense of self. that is why she was dialed back.

7. she said in the movie that she was found in her larva state by ergo. so that is there relation, she is a pet that he keeps around to put him too sleep.  Ergo can manipulate things with his power, he can build stuff. he could make a bridge and the bridge would work, would function as a bridge, just fine weather ergo was awake or asleep.  If ergo made a pencil, and went to bed, there would still be a shaft of wood with graphite inside of it that you could write with.  ergo made a space ship, the space ship flew around just like any other space ship. the ship wasnt powered by or manipulated by ergo in any other way than he was the pilot.  Mantis could put ergo to sleep... and did so in the last fight.

8. groot, didnt have a learning disability, he is like 2 years old tops, probubly less. ever try to explain a thing to a two year old? ever try to explain a complicated thing? they arnt stupid they just dont understand what is important and what is not, they dont understand how things are related and they get distracted easily.  we see in the first scene that groot doesnt understand how dangerous or inportant some situations are just like a kid can play on train tracks or find their dads gun in the closet and not realize the danger they are in. how did he know to press the right button? maybe he did not and guessed. maybe he just realized how bad this situation could be when the tunnel tried to crush him to death and thought really hard. maybe he was just screwing with rocket before becuase it was funny. all of these are plausable.  as for the fighting groot. he fought one guy who was already terrified and running from gunfire and a murdur arrow and then groot tripped him. in the previous scene he was surrounded by dozens of armed guys.  I bet you could trip a guy but could not fight a room of drunk pirates my redditor freind.

9. The MCU is a bit diffrent from the comics so take your grain of salt.  that said, the core that was the size of the building was just his brain. the whole planet was the celestial.... so ergo WAS the size of a planet... and his brain was smaller than that. just like you are a person and are person sized but your individual vital organs are not person sized.

10. correction, some sets were circular, i seem to remember plenty of forrests, square rooms, space ships, open spaces, tunnels, long halls, hexagon rooms, the wild jumbled mazes inside ships... i then ask you this question, ""why were all the scenes yellow?""... ah... wait they werent all yellow....

With that context, I feel like the criticism against volume two is a little harsh.

2 was on the nose but 1 was WAY worse.

Ego is way better than Ronan.

There was tension in this movie. Conflict over who to trust, and what defines a person.

The first one was bigger than this one, in the sense that body count was higher at the end of the movie and there was reason to care about who died in 2 (like the ravagers). Saving the galaxy only came in at the end of 2, and it was still about Peter and his father. So I don't see how 2 was just 1 but bigger.

There are less jokes in this one, as far as I can tell. Novelty, humor an charisma made the first movie great. But the plot and character were pushed to the side. This one mixes emotional depth into the humour, and I actually preferred the jokes they did choose to tell. For example, at the end of the first movie, the showdown is a joke. At the end of the second, it’s a serious showdown against a meaningful villain, with jokes mixed in.


I just don't think that volume two is a rehash of volume one or a weak attempt to go bigger and better. I honestly think they fixed a lot of things and the difference in hype hurt volume two.",69by9z

Agree. Rooker was awesome. Loved him in the replicant(?) with JCVD too.

dh5mmlv,"I disagree. I feel most of the characters grew during this: Quill got parental closer (""avenging"" his mom, getting to know his father(s). Gamora gained a new perspective on her relationship with Nebula (and they sort of reconciled). Yondu redeemed himself in his own eyes and those of his fellow Ravagers. Rocket learned that being a one-man island won't *actually* heal the hole in his heart and took lessons from Yondu. Groot literally grows.

Baby Groot was mildly comical, (I'm sure younger audience members loved it) but I was more impressed by the visuals of the chaotic battle going on in the background. And speaking of which, the visuals were consistently fantastic throughout the film.

I do agree that the choice of music was odd, but it sorta fit. (And again, they're trying to continue the musical aesthetic of the original.)

Assumingly he was a different form every time when he was with a different species(after all, his true form is when you see his face while Kraglin orbits around his planet). His line to Quill about finding a form that would make him the most comfortable also points towards what was going on.",69by9z

dh6pv5m,"With the Sovereign, I thought it was clear with their introduction as to why they freaked out over the batteries so badly. So much as talking down to them was punishable by death, so it would make sense they'd take a manhunt out on the GOTG, especially when their ships start getting destroyed, wounding their pride even further. Loved the scenes of them flipping out over getting their ship destroyed, like a angry child at an arcade. 

I suppose it's better to not really think of the MCU in terms of the 616. I know that can be hard but they are their own thing and can set the standard to whatever they like. I don't really think the scope of Ego was lost so much as we get one scene with him one shotting the Sovereign fleet, then the next time he's in action we now have a equal powered Star Lord to rival him, stunting the scale of his power. A missed opportunity I could say was they should of had him on a planetary level annihilate the Sovereign fleet, instead of the GOTG within his core(that the fleet seemingly get to no problem?)

Can't really blame GOTG for not giving enough Thanos, that was probably Marvel's decision after the blowback of ham handing the cosmic stuff into AoU, which people didn't like too much. Don't really know what purpose he would of served here in this film without detracting it, as infinity stones weren't on the table and that's all he cares about at the moment. It was nice seeing Nebula effected by Thanos to such a degree and not seeing him but hearing of his deeds(replacing Nebula piece by piece) made him much more imposing than actually seeing him in the movie.

GOTG pretty much set the standard for wise-cracking rock soundtrack flicks that have since been copped pretty hard. To GOTG2's credit they *didn't* rely on really anything from the first film like obnoxious callbacks, more dance-offs, recycled jokes in bad taste, or songs used in the first flick.",69by9z
dh6q0a3,"You do understand what ""conceited douchebags"" means right? I'm sure someone might make a commentary about how a bunch of nerdy gamers who won't even risk themselves in battle would be prone to raging over the smallest things. 

As for the Celestials not really, traditionally (I can't say what Marvel has been up to lately) they collectively are powerful but not individually top dogs nor nessecarily at the peak collectively. And toning down is highly appropriate lest we got the sort of rather blah stories like Starlin's original Infinity Gauntlet story where his pet Thanos only looses because he wants to for nebulous reasons, or maybe because Adam Warlock is an even bigger and more loved Starlin pet. Really makes everything that happen have just no stakes at all once you realize there for example was zero reason to have anyone from Earth in that tale. I hope the MCU can do better.

What...? That's a piss-poor comparison. Most, if not all, film adaptations of book/comic-based sources require you to accept things at face value due to time constraints. The LotR & Hobbit films when placed against their source, absolutely suck.

As for Yondu actually agreeing to do the kidnapping, whatever story Ego fed him must have seemed plausible and non-malicious at first, otherwise Yondu wouldn't have agreed to help him. And I say that because Yondu immediately stopped working with him when he realized that Ego was killing the kids, which suggests there *is* a limit to what he's willing to do for profit.

I have to admit I didn't see it coming. If anything I thought it was a Spiderman/Maryjane cancer thing where he didn't know his radiation was doing anything until it was too late or something.

As for why cancer, my only guess was time, the time it took for Meredith to die would've been enough for Ego to have Yondu prepare for Peter's abduction.

In his travels he met Peter's mom. He fell totally in love with her, enough so that he was scared that if he continued, he would lose sight of his purpose.

Stan Lee scene sounded like he was telling the Watchers everything he has seen on Earth. Watchers 'watch' big events in the universe and record them, but never help.

Lee's outfit seemed like a nod to Eben Stafford from Original Sin, the old member from the Men in the Wall. He was part of a group that defended the Earth from secret threats. Here's the cover with Eben, looks pretty similar to Lee's spacesuit - http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/marveldatabase/images/b/b0/Original_Sin_Annual_Vol_1_1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141025152516

Original Sin heavily involved Uatu (the Watcher that looks over Earth), could be another nod to the comic event. ",69by9z
dh5vd4i,"This scene was supposed to be joke but I see a lot of potential. If they can reason out all his cameos this way that provides a great explanation for the Watchers always watch thing.

He's a fantastic character, but I'm totally ok with not joining the group, and I thought about it the whole ride home.

dh9sh8w,"To show how little he actually cared about her in the end. 

Throughout all of their scenes together Ego tells Quill how much he loved Quill's mother. But ultimately she was an obstacle towards him accomplishing his goal because he was drawn to her.

dh5iit8,And Drax is sitting there like he's totally okay with being sad for his family!! 😭😭😭,69by9z

dh79fdz,"I loved that.

Drax is talking about them and sitting there and he's just so stoic and stone-faced about it, and Mantis touches him and INSTANTLY just can't stop crying. It just completely overwhelms her.

He's feeling all of those feelings *all the time* when he thinks of them, but keeps it deep down.

Oof, that got me.",69by9z
dh76f2c,The scene gets even better when you realize that Mantis wants to tell Drax about Ego's plan right then and there because she finds out how a family is supposed to be like. Ego at that point hadn't really told anyone about his whole murder cabinet of children.,69by9z

dh5pw21,Why,69by9z

dh5nt9f,I can see your point. It didn't do that for me though. I get the feeling this film will be a little polarized in this subreddit. ,69by9z
dh75zzy,"It was a gag, but at the same time it served to show just what a fucking monster Ego was.  He wasn't this kindly Kurt Russell fellow, he was literally a giant self-serving planet that could make himself look like anything.

Also I mean, Hasselhoff needs work so...",69by9z
dh5v2ct,"I agree with you. That scene could be extremely powerful. His father killed his mother with a painful death. One that Peter had to suffer through. It could be one of the biggest punches so far in the MCU.

But they dissipate all the tension with the Hasselhoff gag that could have appeared anywhere else in the movie.",69by9z
dhx3rh6,"While I don't think that scene was a problem, I agree with that sentiment. In my case I though that two scenes felt like they could have been a bit more serious but got interrupted by a joke, like the Pacman scene and when Mantid gets hit by a rock breaking the scene.",69by9z
dh7jl1s,"I think this is the case with almost every dramatic moment in the movie. There were so many scenes that were about to give me that /r/frisson feeling, but then someone would say something stupid and break the moment immediately. Don't get me wrong, it was a hilarious movie, but I wish it was as emotionally impactful as the first movie was.",69by9z

I couldn't help thinking that I know the main group needed to get off the planet because it will implode/explode? So they did go a safe distance but they showed later that ship had another secondary ship that Nebula takes off in the end which could have came back for Peter/Yondu sooner or mid air or whatever. Or even the main ship. Or even the fact that Yondu and Peter could outfly the destruction of the planet in the space suit only kind of dampers the fact that one of them could have gone back with another space suit or ship to rescue/intercept them faster.

dh5q7tm,When you think about it. Ego is stupid. He could have stayed with her until she died. Then utilised Quill for his plan without any hiccups. ,69by9z

The first movie did a good job of balancing drama, humor, tension and character development. It would let the tension and drama build a little bit before defusing the tension with humor.

This new movie never lets the drama and tension build (aside from a few points) and quickly brings in the humor.

For example, the scene in the first movie when Peter lets Gamora listen to his walkman. The sexual tension builds for a little bit, he leans in kiss her, THEN the humor comes out.

dh865k0,Thanks for that! It's been a while since I've seen the first one.,69by9z
dhaf88s,"Fair points all, although I would say:

1) He's not necessarily nefarious as of the first scene, for all we know the plant/seed thing in the opening could be Peter, we just have no way of knowing at that point. But I take your point that he's seen to be vaguely ""up to something"" and that begs the question, adding to the gradual build up

2) Agreed, I think this was very much designed with the Empire comparisons we've both made in mind. For me the failings of Guardians 2 underscored the strengths of Empire in terms of telling a relatively small-scope story that's more about the characters than the fate of the galaxy (even though that's at stake) in the context of a grand space opera. I didn't anticipate the parallel going in, or even immediately after, but in thinking through my issues with Guardians 2 it's become clear how much it draws from Empire (which shouldn't be surprising given the similarities in getting to them as movies, second entries in rollicking space adventure film franchises and all)

3) I agree that more seeding (ha) of Ego's turn would have been helpful, but I think you make some good points that it was foreshadowed more than I gave it credit for. I think having the gold people stand as more competent villains might have helped, as they were played up too much for laughs. Also having Yandu talk more about *why* he didn't deliver Peter to Ego earlier in the movie could have helped, but I get why they wanted to save that for the third act. I also would have appreciated more build up to Gamora's turn in the second act, from encouraging Peter to go with Ego and then ultimately having friction with Peter over how close he was getting to Ego. I don't think Gamora's emotional turn re Ego was developed effectively enough, and that made her role seem more plot-driven and in service of the focus on Peter in this movie",69by9z
dha97ve,"I think the second act starts when they decide to go with Ego, and the turn into the third act comes during the discussion where it's revealed that Ego killed Peter's mom. During that earlier discussion about not trusting Ego before they get on his ship, the difference is that it's about Gamora encouraging Peter to take the chance and see where it goes. The second act is about the gradual turn from that position (Peter vulnerable and apprehensive, in comparison to Gamora encouraging and wanting the best for Peter) to the polar opposite (Peter coming to trust Ego while Gamora goes the other direction, and the tension that creates between them). So it's both about drawing out the impact on the Peter-Gamora relationship, as well as laying the groundwork for our turn to distrust Ego and see him as the villain in the third act.

I guess my overall problem is just that the second act feels a bit scattered, as there's no clear antagonist and I didn't feel we got enough to choose to follow Gamora's line of thinking over Peter's (or vice versa, for that matter), and so the shift to ""Oh shit, Gamora was right, Ego is a monster"" is really sudden and jarring, and the build up to that moment is all over the place.

Again though, solid flick, just not up to the standard of Vol 1",69by9z
dha5oak,"I was actually pleasantly surprised by how removed this seemed from the larger Marvel universe, as I didn't expect them to let it stand on its own this close to Infinity Wars.

With that said, did anyone else notice Jff Goldblum's character from the Thor 3 trailer show up in the Guardians 2 credits?!? Did I imagine that? He wasn't in the movie, right? I was so confused by that moment",69by9z

Death, Entropy, Eternity, and Infinity created the Infinity Stones and created the Universe in turn. Thanos isn't anything that can be defined but rather an offspring of chaos. So that's what makes him more terrifying than any celestial. He doesn't belong anywhere, so he is completely alone.

dh8b7qp,"Wow, that video was fantastic. It's one of those things that you'd never even think of unless someone pointed it out. Outside of GOTG, the only songs I can remember from the MCU are both from Iron Man: ""Robot Rock"" and ""Back in Black."" None of them, as you already know, are from an original score. 

GOTG is the same way: its most memorable music is not original, but rather a classic rock song. But, I think that's the whole point. An epic John Williams Superman theme or Hans Zimmer's Dark Knight score wouldn't fit with the theme of GOTG. The music has to be obscure enough to make the film feel irreverent, but familiar enough for us to think, ""man, that's so crazy they put 'Hooked on a Feeling' in this movie!"" Every single song they play in GOTG, in my opinion, enhances the scene. Like I said in point #2, the Yaka Arrow on the Ravager ship scene was already great, but the decision to put a song as seemingly unrelated to the film's theme as ""Come A Little Bit Closer"" made it one I will never forget.

A goal is something to me that is essential for a film. For example I think it's a big reason why Suicide Squad wasn't any good. Don't get me wrong that movie was riddled with problems but for the most part they just walk around and do random stuff.

I think you can have both, it's not like having a goal will hinder the character development, you can have both if done right. The goal can even be related. 

Without a goal we didn't have anything to cheer for and we just kind of watch a random string of scenes happening and it doesn't feel like it's building toward anything. It's not until we actually meet Ego that we have a goal. If there's no goal what are we working towards? What will the climax be? What is the reason we are doing anything? 

Take a look back at the movies you like, I guarantee they have a goal. Think of Saving Private Ryan, we get a good look into the characters while still focusing on the goal, finding Private Ryan and bringing him home. Each character in that movie has an arc and depth. 

You can have both. And I think a goal is essential.

dhdn6i3,"My perspective is that of someone who knew nothing about GOG before I went and saw the first movie.  To be honest, I haven't really connected with most of the Marvel/super hero stuff.  GOG just felt much fresher to me - the humor, the music, the kind of looseness all just meshed for me to create a really enjoyable experience.

Specific criticism for the new one (keeping in mind I really enjoyed it):

 - all of our main characters seemed essentially invulnerable.  They seem to overcome obstacles with relative ease and even when they were fighting a literal god I was never convinced they were in much danger.

 - some of the jokes felt a little recycled (like the Groot button instruction joke, and why does that instant death button even exist in the first place?)

 - I liked the Yondu/Peter reconciliation minus the ""control with you heart"" line.  Kind of hokey not to mention Yondu controls his death arrow with his heart? You just murdered like 80 dudes with that thing man, that's some dark shit.

Like I said though, I enjoyed it, just liked the first one a bit more.",69by9z
dhe95vy,"The first GotG was the first Marvel movie that was really good at pulling heartstrings and invoking other emotions. The sad dying mother scene, the whimsical dancing intro scene, the triumphant victory over Ronan... the combination of perfect scoring, great writing, and balanced humor all worked in concert to accomplish this.

IMO the writing is a lot more hit-or-miss in this movie (juvenile jokes were interrupting big dramatic moments) but the passion is still there, and the movie still has really powerful moments.",69by9z
dhqp9xh,"I agree that Starlord calling him a trash panda was hilarious, especially when Rocket didn't understand what he said. I laughed. Then the script reiterated about 3 times that he said trash panda, another character didn't understand an Earth reference...

My gripe with a lot of the humor Gunn wrote was just that. Instead of letting a joke land and be funny, the script kept going back to reiterate the joke or situation. That Taser Face scene with Rocket is another example. Bad writing.",69by9z

There were other ways for Peter to learn that Ego killed his mother. For example: Star-Lord's Celestial powers were directly linked to Ego's core / brain.

I think if you're that lukewarm on the first Guardians, then it would probably be best to hold off on seeing Guardians 2 for a bit (or at the very least, don't pay for a $20+ ticket). But I do recommend seeing it. 

I don't regret buying my ticket, and I wasn't at all disappointed by the movie. I'm still processing what I saw. Right now, I like Guardians 2 more than Guardians 1. I liked the story a lot more, and I liked the villain a lot more. My major complaint is the humour. It was funny, and I laughed at the majority of the jokes, but there were a few jokes or gags that went on too long or fell flat.

I do wonder how I'd feel if I'd seen all the trailers beforehand. I saw the teaser, and saw the second trailer only because it was attached to Rogue One back in December. Beyond that, I avoided promotional material like the plague because I was worried they'd put too many jokes in the promotional material.

The only one necessary was the setting up of Adam. Where was anything to do with Thor, or Infinity War? This was the perfect movie to hype up either of them as well as expanding the MCU through the cosmic universe and instead we got the movie being too self indulged with itself. The Stan Lee scene was pointless since he already had a cameo, the thing with the whistle was a bit funny but didn't do anything to build on the characters, the Groot one was....okay but I felt like we could have got something substantial there instead.

dhkjils,"I think this film was really enjoyable, but there were a few factors it had running against it when comparing it to the first one:

1) They inserted broader humor so as to appeal to a larger audience for more $$$. That is why in addition to the normal witty/absurd jokes you also got turd and dick jokes for the Vin Diesel crowd and not really funny Boomer jokes for the old folks (it wasn't ripe). 

2) It had less scale than the first one, focusing more on character development, and less on a sense of wonder and travelogue. Additionally, it had broad character development rather than deep character development (we learned more about most of the characters instead of a ton about 1 or 2). This was a purposeful decision by James Gunn, so the film had more of a self-contained feel that was different than the first.

3) The trailers didn't spoil the plot, but they did spoil some of the really good jokes. Imagine if you hadn't seen of the funnier scenes in the trailers (""you need someone pathetic like you,"" ""don't press the button,"" ""welcome to the frickin Guardians of the Galaxy, but he didn't say frickin,"" like half of what Baby Groot did, etc.)

Let's Get It On - Marvin Gaye (for the explicit This Is Happening moment)


Not related but, I'd love to see Billy Joel make an appearance on Vol 3. Could TOTALLY see something like 'Angry Young Man' or more mainstream 'Only the Good Die Young' playing as the soundtrack to a fight sequence. Same goes for Elton John's 'Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting.' More mainstream than any of the Vol 2 songs, but who knows what Gunn's got floating around in his head. ",69by9z

dh5qai4,"Your dead right, it happens to absolutely everything on reddit but I also think it's pretty explainable. 

1) you get a much better sense of a movie on the second viewing. 

2) the opening day audiences are likely quite fond of the franchise and therefore more likely to enjoy it. 

3) people get sick of hearing the same opinions over and over. 

4) the hype dies down. Lots of people here are commenting (like myself) probably not even an hour after seeing it. They're still feeling the afterglow.

In general I doubt the people who are commenting now will have much of a change of opinion. More than anything I feel like it's the people who were luke warm on it getting sick of the constant praise. Which leads them to have a more extreme negative opinion than they initially had. ",69by9z

dharucm,">Rocket was entirely different character in this film.  He went from a wise cracking badass to a complete asshole for no apparent reason.

No, there was a pretty obvious reason that was even spelled out clearly in his arc in the first one: it's a defense mechanism used to push other people away before they can reject you. 

In the first one, his walls were still up; he was still the wise-cracking, well-guarded Rocket without any close emotional attachments (save for Groot). He had good reason for being so wary of others as he was not only treated like a freak, even in his universe, but his first memories were of being mistreated in truly awful ways, so he kept everyone at a distance save for the one being that was stranger-looking-and-sounding than him. 

This time around, though, he was surrounded by a group of people who not only held him in a high regard, but cared for him, and it was something that he couldn't easily reconcile, so he reverted to the tried-and-true tactic of acting out and lashing out to push them away lest he become dependent on them and thus become vulnerable. ",69by9z
dhbrtch,[deleted],69by9z
dhbw7oa,"Rocket was not a different character IMO. I thought him being an asshole was a completely natural response from a person who has mostly been a loner. He's finally part of a group, but he has deep-seated insecurities and thus likely still fears inevitable rejection. So he acts like a sarcastic jerk to both bury his insecurity and preemptively piss people off: he's driving people away because it's less painful than being rejected for who he is, which is what he always fears.

Nebula's change was less sophisticated, but still made sense to me. It's like a dog chasing a car, as the Joker once eloquently put -- she's been obsessed with beating Gamora for so long without any success, but she wouldn't know what she actually would do about it in the moment because she's never been in a position where she did beat Gamora.

Gamora's always going to draw the short end of the stick because she's the straight-laced one. But she does learn to be a bit less callous and more sensitive to other people's emotions the more she gets removed from Thanos (and her argument with Quill felt pretty natural -- it wasn't a blowout just a simple dime a dozen argument that happens everyday. I think you're overthinking this one).

Drax I somewhat agree with you. But I also think it's clear that he's learning new emotions like humor during his time with the guardians. You see subtle hints and lines that indicate this is an ongoing, conscious education for him.

Star-Lord is more or less who he is at the beginning of the movie, no question. But with half a dozen characters not everybody is going to go through a transformation. His arc is actually about realizing that he's already fine as is; it's about letting go of the idea that there's a hole in his life from not knowing his biological father.

Yondu's arc is the best in the whole film no question. I don't think the movie should be docked points just because he's not one of the original 5 from the first film.",69by9z
dhcxspc,"I agree with a lot of your points - I get why Baby Groot got the treatment he did (Merchandising, Merchandising, Merchandising! to quote Mel Brooks) but it did get a bit tiring by the end. The only laugh I had from Baby groot was when he just nonchalantly barfed. It was kind of left field and made me chuckle. And teenage groot post credits was pretty good though.

I did personally enjoy Drax's moments, but have to agree that some subtlety from the first was lost. It seems that they switched to Mantis taking the reins for the fish out of water role. And I felt like this deserved a pass given that he had been bonding with the other Guardians for some time now & picking up some of their dynamic.  ",69by9z
dhaf7d0,"ego is not some great movie villain... but relatively speaking he was a million times better than ronan... who was probably the weakest link from the first gotg...

Peter doesn't want to join him?  Oh well.... go make a million more babies until you find one that does want to join you.

Hell I'm going to contradict one of my previous comments.  Ego [killing Peters mother, while very dramatic, was so ridiculously stupid.](#spoiler)  

So what if he even spends the rest of her life with her?  It's a small fraction of a fraction of his life, and he could actually raise Peter and imprint on his young mind the idea of being a Celestial too.   

Someone who has lived for millions of years would plan so long term that our feeble minds couldn't even conceive of it.  he would be planning tens of thousands of years in advance.",69by9z
dhbx1nm,"I don't think he's cartoonishly evil. He's an immortal, incredibly powerful being who spent millions of years completely alone without any other interaction with life.

How do you think you'd act if you were in that position? He's got a completely warped view of life and as callous as it is, it's not fueled by malice. He sees mortal lives as insignificant because to a millions of years old entity, what is a century? It's like a human looking at the lifespan of ant.

He's narcissistic and out of touch with most intelligent life. He doesn't have an anchor to anything or anyone like Quill.

I agree that some of the plot points could have been dealt with more deftly, but you have to remember that he's incredibly powerful, but not in any way all-knowing or even wise, despite having that big planet core brain.

I wanted this movie to work.  I was so excited for it in fact.  But I just think it fell flat and didn't try very hard if that makes sense.  They just dialed it in.  I mean seriously, how many times did Quinn make you laugh?  I would guess that his ""weird shit"" comment is likely one of the three times you can even recall him being funny in the movie.  And he had a hell of a lot more lines than that.  I don't blame Pratt - he nailed the first movie.  This was a writer or director issue.",69by9z
dh80lcv,"First, I understand your point that ""he didn't give a shit about him if he didn't have celetial powers.""  That's totally a fair point.  But given that all those bones were downstairs, we can assume Ego was hunting down ALL his kids.  Does it really take him that long?  Remember, Ego was expecting Quill to arrive thirty years prior and he was stolen from him.  So I find it hard to believe that someone like Ego doesn't hunt down the kid that was stolen from him, especially given the fact that any one kid could be the ""chosen"" one.  You're quite right that the infinity stone thing obviously raised the priority of finding Quill, but it doesn't mean Ego wasn't looking for him all along.

Second, I think you may have missed some of the exposition.  Ego specifically said he couldn't grow his power across the galaxy without at least one more celestial power.  And he also referred to keeping Quill as a battery.  You're right Ego wanted a companion, but he NEEDED the battery for his plan to work.

Third, thanks for agreeing with the exposition.  It just made me feel like the director thought we were totally stupid.  Don't explain the movie - present it.

Fourth, as for the brain, my issue was only that it looked like a brain.  A brain is a human organ - I would expect a celestial being to not have the most important part of its being mirror what is arguably the most important part of a human.  Just seemed lazy.

Fifth, definitely in the ""upper half"" of marvel movies.  I liked it, but these characters demanded a movie I should love.  I felt let down, but more importantly I felt like my characters were let down.",69by9z
dh9u8lc,For what exactly?,69by9z
dh870h3,"(1) Yes, he found all life wanting so he wanted to destroy it and replace it with himself.  That was what they said, you're correct.  Is that a motivation?  Come on man, so I'm meant to believe that this omnipotent being wants to destroy all life just because, and at the same time he is crying about being lonely?  Also what makes ""perfection"" so important - he wasn't portrayed as a perfectionist in the movie, so his desire for perfection wasn't really well portraryed.

(2) As for his heart, I think you're missing the point.  My point was, why does the central part of this omnipotent alien god just happen to look like the central part of a human - a brain.  They couldn't come up with something more, I don't know, alien like?",69by9z

(2) How do YOU know he's never invited more than one being/child?  For goodness sake, he freely invited several into his own ship.  How do you know that's the first time?  Plus, regardless, he is a PLANET - what, he can't focus on more than one thing at a time?  Seriously?

(3) If you won't give me the crater thing, then for fucks sake - how about the fact they just ""happen"" upon it?

(4) You say he wasn't looking for Peter until newsworthy.  Wrong - he looked for him 30 years ago, and the man who was singlehandedly FEEDING Ego children, stole this one child and ran.  Are you seriously saying Ego didn't look for the ONE child that disappeared?  Stolen by his loyal mercenary Yondu?

(5) You explain the comment about killing the mother as ""hubris"" - come on man, the ONLY reason to say that was to piss off Quill and move the story along.  Super lazy story telling.  You don't create the story to move from scene to scene - you move the scenes to follow the story.  Frankly this was one of the points I didn't think anyone would argue with.

(6) There was SO much exposition.  As for the heart thing, did I miss the bit where Quill knew (and no-one else knew) that they had to drill into the heart?  They all knew they were going into the middle to find the heart - why did he need to say ""if we do x, it will die"" - it was to allow the ""stupid"" audience members to keep up.

(7) My issue with the heart/brain was that it LOOKED like a human brain.  How unimaginative.  The central organ of an alien being just happens to be the same as our central organ?

(8) The gold-race HAD bones, but lost them by proving themselves jealous, petty and incompetent.  They lost all intrigue as the movie progressed, so no, I don't think they were being built up for future use - in fact, their equity was spoiled in this movie.

(9) Fair point on Groot's ""growth"" I guess.  But my larger point in comparing the big toe/bomb scenario was to show it was the same GAG, not to show lack of growth.

(10) I think you're confusing my point.  I have no issue with Stallone's CHARACTER being in the movie - I'm saying it was actually Stallone's acting that fell flat.",69by9z

I thought the second film surpassed the first in almost every way. It was funnier, had more emotional depth, and it didn't have to spend nearly as much time on exposition as Vol.1.  

I will agree with you however, that Ego was a very one dimensional villain and that Peter's reaction upon learning the truth about his father's evil plan was not realistic. Ego in general was pretty poorly conceived. There just wasn't enough time for Quill to go through the whole range of emotions that a person would experience in that situation.

dhfgddp,"1. Doesn't matter if it wasn't done poorly. It was overkill
2. Comic book movies and other such fare require something called ""suspension of disbelief"" so that the audience can buy into the fantastic story you are watching. When characters look like they are in a video game and the rules of physics are thrown out of the window, it takes away from that and takes the viewer out of the story. 
3. Creative is subjective. It looked exceedingly cheesy to me. 
4. Ego also said it took him millions of years to control matter to shape it at will but we are expected to believe Quill masters this in 15 minutes all for a silly gag. 
5. If there was nuanced tension, that was a credit to the actors reacting to Kurt Russell, not his performance. I don't entirely blame Russell either, part of it is the writing. 
6. He was comic relief but it was overkill. They also had Groot and Rocket for comic relief as well as many other gags throughout. I think Drax had some real menace and gravitas the first time around and in this one, it was just waiting for the next silly thing he says. 
7. It was completely unneeded. If it gets scorn when it happens to women, it deserves scorn for men as well. 
8. It was explained in order to cover up the lapse in the writing and attempting to shoehorn plot elements around in a hamfisted way.

Rocket was the biggest letdown to me. I like what Bradley does with the vocal performance but I felt his dark past could have been fleshed out. He cries when Yoondu dies but i don't get why. 

I think... and this is something I first noticed in Age of Ultron. These movies give the barest minimum of time for characters to interact in ways that don't further a plot or action set piece. They are so jammed packed with long action scenes there's not much else. It's also because there's too many damn people. You have the 5 guardians, yoondu with more time, Kurt russel, mantis lady, gold lady, nebula with more to do, and for some reason you needed James Gunn to give his brother so much screentime.

Look at the amazing and beautiful things the writers/designers created - the planet of Ego, the different races, the different weapons, the different bad guys, etc. Yet for the crux of the film, the showdown of good versus evil, they can think of nothing better than a bomb? I think you misinterpret a bit that I'm mad specifically that the bomb had a timer when actually I just thought the need to kill him with a bomb (yes, with a timer) was lazy given the scope of the world they'd already created.

Indebt protagonist -> seduce protagonist -> use protagonist to destroy the universe, which is one of few ways that this storyline plays out.

There was an attempt to ground him and I was on board, but ultimately, a two minute prologue isn't enough, and then they made the character so distant and removed from humanity that the conflict had no complexity. That the motivation for Chris Pratt to save the day was to have Kurt Russell say, ""I gave your mother brain cancer,"" was just disappointing. It's *so* easy. Everything about it is easy. 

I wish they had used a different storyline. There has to be something in the Marvel backlog that utilizes omnipotence in an interesting way. Maybe Kurt Russell's race needs to subsume in order to survive but at the same time, keeps the universe from rupturing asunder.

Actually, the guy can create and alter matter. He even created an avatar that is, for all intents and purposes, ""alive"". It even has a WORKING PENIS. Could he not just have... replaced her cells as they died, on his planet, making her functionally immortal, too?

Was he okay with the genocide though? I though Ego had not explained that part yet, was just showing him the universe but maybe I misinterpreted it wrong. Also, if that was the case he was fine with it because his eyes were glowing and he was viewing it from a celestial viewpoint.

But I don't understand why it transgressed that far.

Because if the director/producers/writers/audience ask ""But why?"" to just about every aspect of that film, none of it makes any sense.

First fight.  Gold people can't fight the alien because...each one is engineered for a specific purpose? So they can't fight this alien using typical weaponry (it dies from a fucking sword), because...why?  They're able to chase the Guardians and attack them using typical weaponry. (Note: using typical as in ""weird space guns that are typical for the universe.)  But they can't use those same ships to target an alien, only another spaceship?  

All to protect their batteries, which are super important.  But...why? They can't make new batteries? Rocket stole their batteries, they end up exploding at the end, so that race isn't ever getting those batteries back.  I guess that planet is just doomed to extinction now because their super important batteries are lost forever?  

A daring escape through a quantum asteroid field! I'll ignore how stupid ""quantum asteroids"" are because it's a wacky universe.  They get through the other side and ""oh no, the gold people went around!""  So you went through the asteroid field...why? It wasn't a shortcut, the gold people were on the other side in the same amount of time.  

Somehow the jump they take will get them to safety.  But why? The gold people can't follow them through? Yandu's ship later goes through 150 or whatever.  The jump is safety...why?

They crash, Kurt shows up. Somehow knows right where his son is. (Why?)  Rocket suddenly doesn't understand how perspective/vision works. (Why?) Daxx heads to Ego with the others instead of helping Rocket. (Why?) Groot doesn't understand how buttons work, but is able to free Gamora at the worst time. (Why?) The one and only other life form he tolerates is because she helps him sleep. (Why does he need to sleep? He existed since the birth of the universe but only lately he needs sleep? Or was she around since the start of the universe too? Why?)  

Kurt explains stuff; he decided he wanted to explore the universe ""to know what it meant to be human,"" but he didn't meet humans until 34 years prior to when the movie takes place? His whole plan is to essentially destroy the universe so it's just him.  Wait, didn't he start exploring the universe in the first place because it was lonely being just him? So...why? 

Sylvester goddamn Stallone.  Why? Oh, he's there to show that these ruthless scumbag shitheads have a super serious code about no children.  Yandu didn't eat Peter, didn't molest him, raised him up. So...why is the head of this shithead gang mad? They suddenly have some weird honor system? 

These same people start throwing their crewmates out of the airlock just a bit later. Why? They excommunicate a member for kidnapping a kid, they have a super elaborate space burial ceremony for a fallen member.  But they'll toss their fellow crewmembers out of the airlock, people they've probably spent years working alongside, probably even friends with them, yep right out the airlock they go.  Why?

Yandu gets his ship back and promptly blows up 90% of it.  Why?

There's a button on the bomb that blows up everything instantaneously.  Why?

Second in command at the very end is playing with the arrow, even though Yandu specifically states the other fin was a prototype, and literally the scene before you watch it evaporate with the rest of his corpse. 

Do I need to go on much further? Because I can, but that would require giving this movie more thought than the people making it did.

Now its said that you should be able to hear how good a movie is based on the script alone.  Over and over I heard one liners and zingers.  The only actual time I heard the plot move forward was during Kurt Russell's explanation of how he was star loads father.  Then we got a bunch of penis jokes.  This was a little odd too since the humour was so dumbed down (kids humour) that it didn't make sense to lace in adult themes.  It's like telling a child ""why did the chicken cross the road? Because he needed condoms!""   

Now I say it was bad due to a couple of issues I saw as well.  you have to remember its kinda hard to get a good nap in while sound effects, explosions and Bautista's laugh are permeating throughout the theater.

I see a board room with six 20 somethings pulling the favourite die hard, and batman four (One with Arnold ""Chill Out!"") quotes laying them out on a table and using them over and over and over again.  ""My arm hurts. Well rip it off!.  The only thing I'm rippin is farts!""  Movies can really be a hell of a lot better but not as long as Disney keeps pushing these things out on the conveyer belt.

Current demographic : ""Best movie 2017!, What makes it good? A flying red line!"" 

Oh damn so innovative!

Background noise ""Was the plot predictable? was much of the characters built on one liners? Did it bother anyone that since its a super hero movie a ""core"" member is never really ever in any way at risk of being killed, hence the action is only to please people that is not smart enough to figure it out that nothing is a coincident. that NEVER will a core character be in harms way and hence never any surprises""

dh6q4tb,"I liked it for the same reason. It already was a long fight scene and had some grim moments in it - seeing Groot almost crushed was dark. Having a moment of levity really brought it back to fun campy action.

Totally get why that tone shift can be distracting, though. It does lessen the intensity and tension.",69by9z
dh5nm9q,"Yeah, for me that went a bit too far over the line of absurd and discordant tone. I thought they straddled it pretty well with some things--for instance, the arcade-like Sovereign fleets--but that moment belonged in a Dreamworks movie. Which is to say, it's not a bad joke in itself, but it didn't fit what the movie was doing at the moment.",69by9z

dhadven,"All righty, sorry for the delay on this - it's also been a minute since I've read the series, and I'm only going to focus on Nebula/Thanos here since there's tons of moving parts.

Basically, Thanos gets all the stones ('gems' in the comics) mounted to the gauntlet and decides this is how he's going to woo Death - it's been back and forth as to whether he's actually seeing Death's embodiment or if he's nuts, but I haven't read the more recent Thanos comics by Jim Starlin or Jeff Lemire, so maybe they clear that up.

He decides to do this by literally snapping his fingers and blinking half of all living things out of existence in the universe. This obviously gains the attention of the universe's heroes, who go try to kick Thanos' ass. It doesn't really work, even when Thanos metaphorically ties one hand behind his back.

The whole time, he basically is chilling in his private asteroid base like in Guardians, all trying to flirt with Death (literally) and Nebula is his zombie slave. See, before this, she claimed that he was her pop-pop, but he was like nah and lit her up with some lasers from the gauntlet to turn her into a deformed husk of a person that was not alive or dead and was there literally to suffer for the rest of its existence (which was however long he decided would amuse him).

What Thanos doesn't know is that while he's been fighting first the heroes, then the forces of the universe (like, Eternity, etc.), she was actually sentient and alive the whole time and plotting to kill him. Thanos leaves his physical body to fight the forces of the universe, and while he's distracted she takes the gauntlet off his hand and puts it on herself, restoring her from deformity and undoing Thanos' actions.

The thing is, Thanos prepared himself for a long, long time for what comes with wielding the gauntlet. It's not just putting it on and thinking things up like a Green Lantern ring - it gives you omnipresence, omniscience, and omnipotence. Imagine that wormhole scene in Interstellar on steroids. 

So, while it seems like it's a good thing it's not Thanos wielding the gauntlet, this is actually much, much worse since Nebula doesn't know what she's doing and is liable to really fuck stuff up. So now, everyone (including Thanos) has to team up to get the gauntlet off of her as well. Eventually, they succeed and Nebula is imprisoned awaiting trial for her actions (she was sort of a bitch before this whole gauntlet business had shaken out).",69by9z

People need to embrace new technology, guardians of the galaxy vol 2 looks fantastic and they got shots you can't do with film due to the size of the camera and lighting and other restrictions.

If there's no good reason to introduce a goal early on then they shouldn't just force it for the sake of some fake, superficial narrative.

And frankly your expectations are very contradictory.

Suicide Squad definitely had a goal throughout the movie. They walk in and do stuff but it's stuff that contribute to the goal. I mean that's literally why they were set free in the beginning of the film, so I'm not even sure what you're describing as ""goal"" anymore. 

>Without a goal we didn't have anything to cheer 

You don't need a thing to cheer for in *every second of every minute*. And frankly you're not even correct in this point.

You can cheer when the Gurdians you know, didn't get blown up and die from the Sovereign, or when Peter reunites with his father and starts to bond and play catch with him. People cheer or are happy to see emotional connections between the characters. There doesn't have to be some forced goal in there. 

>It's not until we actually meet Ego that we have a goal.

We met Ego in the beginning of the film though...? It was like in the first 20 minutes. Literally the majority of the film took place on his planet.

>What will the climax be? What is the reason we are doing anything?

You don't need some forced goal to anticipate a climax lol. A climax is going to be present in every film no matter what. That's why people will still expect it. And also, character dramas are a thing. There are still climaxs in character dramas.

And no offense, I don't think you're really sure what you're talking about. You're going to need to expand on what you mean by ""goal"" because from your comment it's all over the place.

Furthermore, most of us paid over $20 to see the film (ticket *plus* snacks), they shouldn't push us out before the film is *completely* over. $15 for just a ticket is pretty much highway robbery compared to how much tickets were back 20 years ago (about $3 to $6).

Whimsical dancing and the soundtrack were what made the original really fun.

 Victory over Ronan was really dumb. Most of the writing in the first was hampered by it having to be a part of the marvel universe.

Remember the scene where Yondu was like I know what you are etc. Yondu was like Rocket too scared to trust or really let other people get close to him so they always do something to push them away or something. 

But that didn't even make sense to me bc we kinda got this discussion/explaination in the first move when the Gaurdians come together in the first movie.

By the end of that first movie, it seemed like all of that cleared itself.  

This entire movie felt like Gunn spent 3 months combing the internet to see reviews and opinions pieces one what worked and didn't work for people and then took EVERY SINGLE THING that worked in the 1st movie and did it times 1000.  And it got old super quick.

Remember at the end he was like ""I already lost one friend, I can't lose another"" and then the funeral where all of Yondu friends who ""hated"" him for breaking the Ravagers code would still show up for him when it mattered after redeeming himself, Rocket wouldn't be alone either.

In Guardians 2, we pretty well get confirmation that, not only is this a cutting of the old groot growing into a new one, but he is relearning (or rather learning in the first place) how to interact with people and the world. This alone makes him a wildly different character from his comics origins, and really ups the risks for the character.

dh5tq26,"Well, is you ask of errors, I don't see where is the connection between the fact that one of the characters is a Boltzmann brain and the fact the others are imaginary.

Thoguh, I had lots of fun contemplating this whole Boltzmann brain idea. Because it's actually a comforting way to explain the fact the universe exists.

If we state a question: if the universe exists, why it was preferred over the ethernal emptiness. A never ending emptiness feels like a pretty natural state of existance. And then the fact the complex non-chaotic universe exists, can't be explained.

But if we suppose, that ethernal emptiness was never a stable state of existence, and instead suppose, that an absolute chaos is the base state, then we can think of our universe as a fluctuation of the same kind as the Boltzmann brain.

I mean, Boltzmann brain idea doesn't require the fluctuation to become self-conscious immediately. It only requires the fluctuation to be able to have a property of being self-conscious.

And our universe have evolved to create self-conscious creatures, humans. It is a fact given in senses.

So, we can state a hypothesis: it's statistically a more frequent event: a fluctuation creates a system, that is able to evolve to become conscious. Than a less frequent event: a fluctuation creates a system that is complex enough to immediately become self-conscious.

And this simply allows to view our universe as a Boltzmann brain. But also, it makes the existence of the universe more understandable. A fluctuation in chaos is more natural than an event in emptiness.",69by9z

On a side note I think the writing was bad in general.

But with nothing connecting them, it's just an abrupt character shift that dangles in the way of the movie until the end where it's explained.  Explaining it helps, but that doesn't undo how jarring it is for most of the film.

I entirely agree about Drax.  He had some seriously good stuff going on, and it's perfectly plausible that he's undergoing changes to fit in with the group.  All that good stuff just happened to come at the same time as all of his subtle charm being thrown out in favor of LAUGH LOUDLY AT EVERYTHING.

I'm okay with Quill not changing.  Heck, I'd be okay with most-to-all of them not changing.  It's not change that bothers me, it's unpredictable shifts in major characteristics that throws me off.

I'm not sure exactly what happened because it's not like the film changed hands drastically (Gunn was involved in the writing and directed the first one as well), but it left me thinking that it was either a terribly rushed script (but even so, there's a CLEAR way to have written the same film, but more tightly) or that Nicole Perlman's influence on the first script was much greater than anybody realized.

> is a big blue head ""archetypal of fear"" ? Of course not - a monster would have been.

Yes it is. Sorry, it just is. From the Wizard of Oz to Rick and Morty to TFA, it's a reoccurring symbol of power and intimidation. You're right, a monster would've been cool, but they opened with a monster so...

> (2) How do YOU know he's never invited more than one being/child? For goodness sake, he freely invited several into his own ship. How do you know that's the first time? Plus, regardless, he is a PLANET - what, he can't focus on more than one thing at a time? Seriously?

Well he has obviously never been attacked or defied in such a way before because if he *had* he'd either be gone much like Peter's crew eventually rendered him gone, or he would've implemented defenses as far along as any previous insurgent got. Say someone from before *had* stumbled upon the pile of bodies and freaked out about it. Obviously Ego won any fight that resulted because Ego is *still around*. But he would've *closed off or cleaned up the pile of bodies* before trying out the next child. The fact that he hadn't shows he has never had the need to.

Or, to put it another way, my Grandpa has barbed wire wrapped around the bird feeders in his yard because he has been burned by squirrels before. (Fun side fact: the barbed wire doesn't really work though. He gets so mad. It's hilarious.)

> (3) If you won't give me the crater thing, then for fucks sake - how about the fact they just ""happen"" upon it?

C'mon now, you keep saying you want to be shown not told but when you are shown you hold it against the movie?

> (4) You say he wasn't looking for Peter until newsworthy. Wrong - he looked for him 30 years ago, and the man who was singlehandedly FEEDING Ego children, stole this one child and ran. Are you seriously saying Ego didn't look for the ONE child that disappeared? Stolen by his loyal mercenary Yondu?

I just don't think it matters to the point of declaring ""we deserved better"". 30 years is nothing to someone who has been around for eons, and we don't know how many children he had, it could be billions, we have no reason to believe he was failing to find and/or starting to get concerned about one child. Yondu betraying him was probably something he just put a pin in until Peter held the damn stone.

> (5) You explain the comment about killing the mother as ""hubris"" - come on man, the ONLY reason to say that was to piss off Quill and move the story along. Super lazy story telling. You don't create the story to move from scene to scene - you move the scenes to follow the story. Frankly this was one of the points I didn't think anyone would argue with.

It just fit the character. And you're right, the ONLY reason to have *anything at all happen in a story* is to *stimulate something else happening* and move the story along. I don't see how that is lazy but literally storytelling. I think your problem was that it was too out of nowhere? Because that's fair. But it was pretty successful at being shocking; evoking an emotional reaction seems worth it.
 
Also, Peter's impulsive response of shooting the holy hell out him was a very human thing to do, something you say he lacked. I just don't think it's possible to give you everything you want, it's contradictory

> (6) There was SO much exposition. As for the heart thing, did I miss the bit where Quill knew (and no-one else knew) that they had to drill into the heart? They all knew they were going into the middle to find the heart - why did he need to say ""if we do x, it will die"" - it was to allow the ""stupid"" audience members to keep up.

Even putting aside that *Rocket did not know, he was physically not there when Ego monologued about 'building layers around the brain that he is' and literally needed to be told*, I have to ask if you've seen a comic movie before? Or any movie with the most marketable rating possible? You can't be shocked about both the studio and the filmmakers casting wide net. Of course there will be some exposition. I think the all caps ""SO"" is being unfairly dramatic. I'm sure there are other instances, but I can only think of Peter's specific line we're discussing. I bet you can me remind of others, but if you have to remind me, that just kind of goes to show it wasn't that bad. 

> (7) My issue with the heart/brain was that it LOOKED like a human brain. How unimaginative. The central organ of an alien being just happens to be the same as our central organ?

True, I agree with you, definitely not original. But why aren't you equally worked up about the vast majority of the *diverse galactic beings* being bipedal english speakers with humanish faces? You should know what to expect from the first one or any other MCU movie, so how can you be let down or think ""we deserve better""? Maybe one day there will be a super astronomically philosophical Marvel movie, that would be very cool, but it will probably be promoted as such. This one wasn't. I don't know why anyone would presume this pg-13 action movie is trying to be the next 2001. Trying to overcome the paradox of thinking of another way of thinking was not this movie's priority.

> (8) The gold-race HAD bones, but lost them by proving themselves jealous, petty and incompetent. They lost all intrigue as the movie progressed, so no, I don't think they were being built up for future use - in fact, their equity was spoiled in this movie.

OK. I just don't feel like this is a loss personally, they were standard issue side villains but they had a neat visual concept and made me laugh so I'm content with them. I think I get what you mean though, a good subplot is an awesome thing, I just had no hopes for one so I was not let down. (Also, I can't think of any examples of one done really well right now, can you?)

> (9) Fair point on Groot's ""growth"" I guess. But my larger point in comparing the big toe/bomb scenario was to show it was the same GAG, not to show lack of growth.

Again, liking reoccurring gags is arbitrary, you either do or you don't. I do agree they all have a shelf-life but it looks like this is Baby Groot's one and only movie, so I'm not too concerned.

> (10) I think you're confusing my point. I have no issue with Stallone's CHARACTER being in the movie - I'm saying it was actually Stallone's acting that fell flat.

No, your point was just unclear. You said he ""seemed out of place"". I like him for what he offers, and to me his acting was the same as always, but if you're a well versed Stallone fan I'll concede this point to you, you can discern varying degrees in his acting that I can not sir.

Anyway, you totes love this movie now. It's basically the best thing you've ever seen. No need to thank me ;)

dhaxtgz,"I'm sorry to say, but more doesn't mean better. In my opinion it was not funnier. The only joke I can recall (saw if yesterday) was the one about ""Legendary poops""... And well, no, poop jokes are almost never funny. Drax's relationship with mantis was nice. And Rocket, alongside Yundu was cool (not much onto the funny side, but in the cool side). That emotional depthness felt fabricated, not earned. Again, the best relationship of this movie was Gamora and Nebula, since they have actually spoken. Like ACTUALLY spoken. Yundu and Peter spoke like 4 times in GotG1 and 3 in GotG2. They just told me they had a relationship and I'm suppose to believe that? Granted it did feel more genuine than anything that was happening with Ego. And the stupid forced relationship between Gamora and Quill. Jeez, the truth is, my real problem is Quill, he was so weirdly written, for some reason he felt really out of character in a lot of the entire movie. He was boring. Rocket, now he had an interesting problem, since Groot was a baby, he was "" alone"" in his family, but oh no, he is shove aside and apparently gets resolve after Yundu speaks to him once. (Also why did Yundu open up to Rocket? That was weird) Rocket should have been the main character.

2. Rules of Physics in a Sci-Fi fiction film? 

3. It is subjective, but for some reason you can't look past it being someone else's creative interpretation?

4. Is it the gag you have the issue with or Quill's control of rocks? If he didn't create Pacman would it have sat better with you? Because you're complaining that he made Pacman, but your rebuttal was that he shouldn't had that much power yet.

5. Again your opinion I saw this with 6 people the first time, and 4 people the 2nd time and they all seemed to pick up on it easily from Kurt Russell and his presence. He seemed to have a phony thinly veiled presence of friendliness, but it clouded by uncertainty...which yes would've been picked up and played with by the other characters because they're supposed to.

6. Again subjective opinion.

7. It was one scene! Women are usually scantily dressed throughout the entire film. May as well put a shirt on Drax if we're going that route! Maybe we need more men so that there's less scorn in the future. Don't perpetuate the scorn!

8. That's so asinine. It wasn't just written to shoehorn in plot elements. For how much time was given to that arc it was obviously in the forefront when they were writing the script. The main theme of the movie was Family. 

9. SAG Rules and Multi-picture contracts are my opinion or your understanding of them is my opinion? Also if doesn't make a difference to you whether they use a stage hand or Vin Diesel why are you complaining about it?

if the time stone is used poorly by Dr. Strange it can literally ruin the whole universe... and apparently it is very easy to screw up the use of it according to other characters.  When strange brought that one page in that one book back he could have destroyed the earth or scrambled events in a thousand terrible ways that could have resulted in his death BEFORE he learned magic.  they make that pretty clear.  one slip and things get crazy

the time loop was also used in a dimension that did not have time to begin with, and against a foe who could not understand time.  any other use of the time loop would have been much more complicated and complicated=harder which= more opportunities for the dr. to screw up in cool ways.

it seems that a major theme in Dr. Strange movies and stories going forward is going to be the miss-use of magic, and  how the super effective actions of dr. strange have unexpected and potentially terrible repercussions.  I mean that is Mondu's whole shtick.  i can foresee some crazy butterfly effect madness on the horizon, which will be fun.  

Can you point to a single time travel story where the ability to time travel did not totally screw up the lives of the time traveler in interesting ways? Primer, the time machine, back to the future, planet of the apes, Edge of tommorrow....  the power to manipulate time raises the stakes, but creates more problems then it solves

also Thanos is about one or two movies away from nabbing the time stone anyway... so they can not keep looping time to solve problems.

I'll take Ego over a 12th rendition of powerful menace shouting hackneyed threats and endleslly monologuing about destroying or rule everything and everyone (see Ronan, Malekith, Loki in Avengers, Ultron, and probably the latest Thor villain).

The villain storyline cycle you described really isn't as limiting and cliche as it seems; there are a limited number of archetypes in any story. It's about all the little factors that flesh out the archetype. 

I thought they executed it pretty well in this case, because I think they did a decent job of reconciling the dichotomy of the horrible things Ego has done with the front he puts on for Peter. 

Sure, there could have been a more complex motivation than Ego killing Meredith, but I thought it was interesting seeing a narcissistic, selfish character like Ego, who was capable of such callous horrible actions, and yet wasn't motivated by malicious intent. Most films go on one side of the spectrum or the other (mustache twirling or vicious brute bad guy, or conflicted, jaded, morally complex bad guy), or outside of the spectrum with some sort of force of nature that lacks conscious agency; this film went in the middle of the spectrum which is pretty unique. Ego's not a malignant evildoer, but he's not conflicted either. He acts with complete awareness of the consequences of his actions and yet without any sense of right and wrong.",69by9z

As for the pay offs... I think this movie was really focusing in on why all the Guardian's gave a shit about each other. The first movie touched on it lightly, but after this movie I truly believe that they all care for each other.

Gamora had a sister who she was constantly pitted against as a child. They grew up hating each other because of Thanos. So, she had a sister she had a hard time loving and a father she hated.

Rocket was created by scientists who didn't give a shit about him, as pointed out by Yondu. Yondu, was abandonded by the ravagers because he was caught smuggling children to Ego. Then, Yondu decides to keep, raise, and protect Starlord and is then ousted by his own team of ravagersfor starting to care for others.

Starlord obviously lost his mother early in his life, and has been looking for his father ever since. 

Drax lost his entire family in a battle and clearly still misses them dearly. 

It really explored these character, I think, and made me believe that they actually cared about each other. The first movie brought them together, the second movie made me believe they were a team. Not to mention, I think Yondu's arc was easily the best. He was so good in this movie. ",69by9z
dhdgwc8,"The Gamora/Nebula thing hardly counts as a fully-fledged storyline. It's a character dynamic which is entirely different. Every movie has a handful of these.

And not everything gets wrapped up in a neat bow at the end of a movie. It would be pretty ridiculous for Gamora and Nebula to have resolved all their feelings about each other in a single day after hating each other for such a long time.

Quill/Ego was wrapped up in a perfectly satisfying way. Quill comes to the realization that not knowing his biological father didn't leave him with an empty childhood or a hole in his life -- he had a capable father figure all along in Yondu.

As for Rocket/Yondu/Ravagers, I don't see what was unresolved here. The plot certainly was (they beat the mutineers). Yondu's arc was certainly resolved as he redeemed himself and had a complete reconciliation with Quill. Rocket learned to get over his insecurities and habitual isolation and become more comfortable in the relatively new family dynamic he is a part of.",69by9z

No one really changes that substantially in the first one they just start to like each other. Idk I thought they made the characters more interesting.

There is also Rocket's arc: he is learning to be less of an asshole. He has to learn to stop being a lone wolf and start being more of a pack animal. Also, while he had an equal in combat and life within Groot, now Groot is a baby, just barely learning to walk. His vulnerabilities show Rocket's vulnerability.

I think it's because it was in his genetics. The light fading in his hands is the light he conjured while on the planet, when he was focusing. Genetically he should be the same: half-human, half-Celestial.

I got some tricks in my bag. Would that be helpful?’ And they said, ‘Yeah, as much as you can. That would be great.’ I was speaking to the gal last night who does the CGI. She said, ‘What did you think of what we did?’ And I said, ‘I thought it was great. But I understand you didn’t do a whole lot?’ She said, ‘No we didn’t. We touched it up here and there.’ He did a fantastic job. He does have a lot of tricks, not just makeup. Cosmetics I should say.”

Nebula showing up suddenly being trusted by Gamora and the rest of the team going ""WHY IS THE BLUE LADY HERE? DON'T WE HATE HER?"" and it being accepted because Gamora says it's okay is a 100% fantastic show of trust among team members. They trust her to have had that experience while they weren't there.

It's a TEAM. The story needs to be about the TEAM.

dh7825k,"They did and that could have been explored more. I've been thinking more about this;

the vast majority of the movie, they were only used/seen as an enemy chasing our heroes and providing an ongoing threat. In portraying that threat, there was no nuance or complexity to their actions. They just chased and doggedly attacked. Okay, that can be fine, but that's where the majority of my ""one-dimensional"" view comes from.

There were a few other scenes with them in the movie; I'm mainly thinking of the throne scene where the Guardians were given Nebula and the scene w/ the Reavers. I think these scenes were meant to provide more depth to the characters, but I don't think they really did. I get that the scenes explained how arrogant and full of themselves the Sovereign were, but the movie itself treated them as jokes, so it was hard to take them seriously.

I think that was sort of my main problem with the movie. It treated everything as so silly, that proper depth couldn't evolve. Were the Sovereign supposed to be capstone cops chasing our heroes or a real threat to our heroes? It seemed like the movie couldn't decide. The plot seemed to want them to be a continuing real threat to our heroes, but the movie didn't take them seriously. Not just our characters, but the movie. They were basically rich, spoiled kids playing in an arcade and even the movie made fun of them in every scene.

That was a problem with more than just the Sovereign as well. It permeated the movie and how the movie treated everything.

I don't expect War and Peace from the movie. But the original was a bit more.. serious? balanced? nuanced?  This movie was clearly intended to be a slapstick action movie and does a decent job at that.",69by9z

I mean, power is such a basic view of a characters in my opinion within the universe. Is he more conniving, unpredictable, malevolent and reckless than a celestial?

So it's inhis vested interest to  consume planets as he needs them in order to lengthen his life span. Savor them if you will. This makes him fairly predictable, but terrifying nonetheless. Thanos, on the other hand, would rather snap his fingers and destroy half the life in the unuverse to simple terrify the half that's living. Hell, he'd do it just as a motion of power. Does he need the infinity gauntlet to show his true strength? Perhaps. But the fact that he's willing to weild it while celestials barely harness one stone should display his audacity and the true scope of his power.

There's external and internal conflict. A big part of Peter's internal conflict is finding his father, not knowing him, etc.. My argument is that up until about 30-40 minutes, this is when we meet Ego and we tap into Peter's internal struggle. It's not until this point that the movie establishes a goal. I loved every minute of this movie, but it wasn't until that point that I had any idea what this movie was going to be about. They fight a inter-dimensional being, then steal some batteries, try to run away while getting chased, saved by deus ex machina, and then crash land on a planet. Then this is where we meet Ego. Yes we can cheer for them in these scenes, as these scenes have a goal, but they're only held within these scenes. There wasn't an overarching goal until we meet Ego. And my argument is that an overarching goal is essential and that the film established it a little late, that's all. 

Suicide Squad does give us something early on, work in exchange for their sentence. However the entire second act of the movie is them just walking around doing stuff. I didn't feel like the movie was working towards something the entire second act. It wasn't until the third act that the goal came back into light. 

I know we don't need something to cheer for *every second*. Now you're adding things to my point to make me sound stupid. And I believe you absolutely need a goal, whether they are internal or external, we need a goal. Your argument against it was just ""and frankly you're not even correct in this point."" What kind of rebuttal is that? 

You're correct we can cheer when the Guardians didn't get blown up, or when Peter reunites with his father, something he has mentioned throughout the two movies. The emotional connections were nice, and that would be part of Peter's internal struggle and goal. So THAT is a goal. But once again, my argument was that the overarching goal was established pretty late. 

Again, your wording it to make it sound like I'm stupid. I never said that there wasn't a climax and that character dramas don't have climaxes. Until we learn what Ego has really done, we are just watching the crew do stuff on this planet. Yes it's related to their character, but my argument was that you CAN, and in my opinion, SHOULD have both be accomplished. You're making it sound like I'm shitting on the movie or something. 

And again, I never said Suicide Squad didn't have a goal. I'm saying that about 2/3 of the movie they neglected the goal, and just showed the characters walking around doing stuff.

dh5ucdb,"> I don't see where is the connection between the fact that one of the characters is a Boltzmann brain and the fact the others are imaginary.

As far as I understand the concept, it would be as follows:

Ego is a Boltzmann brain, thus everything he/it created (basically the entire universe) is just imagination, which means everything inside that universe is not real. It appears real to Ego, and each and every part of that imginary universe *feels* real to Ego and to everyone/everything inside that universe - yet they are not real. It's all fake, simply a very long dream.

Ego exists in the real universe (base-reality) as a Boltzmann brain, but everything he created may or may not exist in the real universe (base-reality), meaning the entire Marvel universe is just part of Ego's imagination.

Another being, that lives inside the real universe (base-reality) might be able to observe Ego, but Ego's universe might not be observable because it is ""inside"" Ego.",69by9z
dh5uij9,"As for the rest of your post, I agree: the Boltzmann brain concept is very interesting to think about. For me, it is very difficult to understand all the details and I will have to dig a bit deeper.

I actually think it explains a few things quite well, but the problem is that it will be very difficult to prove - basically (I think) because we don't know if we are the result of a complex system that became self-conscious at some point - or if we just think we are, while we simply are the projection/imagination of a Boltzmann brain.

Are we in base-reality and is everything we experience real? Or are we inside a simulation/imaginary universe that just feels real but actually is not?",69by9z
dh5u7c0,"The distinction's relevance depends on your point of view, respectively what is important to you I guess?

The difference is that if you were a Boltzmann brain, everything around you is simply imagination most of the part. For you it is reality, but actually it is not base-reality - it's pretty much a simulation. Either an entirely ""digital"" one, meaning it only exists in your brain - or an ""actual"" one, meaning you created it yourself, thus it is made of ""matter"" but actually it is not real, thus not observable by others on the ""outside"".

If you are not a Boltzmann brain you most likely experience base-reality, meaning everything should be real and not ""fake""/""imaginary"".

So if it is important to you to be part of base-reality and not just a complex imaginary being as the result of some weird magic, then the distinction is relevant for sure. If you don't care if you actually exist or not, then it's all the same I guess?",69by9z

Insecure and lonely people aren't cured the moment companionship comes along. The whole point of the first movie was that all of these people were extremely damaged -- that damage isn't repaired overnight. Some of it never is.

Enter this movie. The characters are still learning, evolving. Rocket's emotions are treated much more subtly. They don't go right out and say ""he's being an asshole because he's uncomfortable with opening up to these new friends and fears they'll ultimately reject him"". It's a give-and-take struggle; he was at least comfortable in his prior miserable existence.

I don't think you're following part 2 at all.",69by9z
dh9q57l,"I don't think this is about applying personal preferences.  As you said, Gunn went for a wider audience OR he just phoned in a lazy movie.  Either way, as you yourself recognize, this was not a movie that was engineered to deliver a tight perspective, and that isn't a personal preference, its a valid criticism.  The story, characters, and direction just weren't tight - they were loose and sloppy and broad.  The first movie avoided many of these issues.

(1) A big fucking blue head is NOT the archetype of fear - its an archetype of cliched fear.  The fact you reference the Wizard of Oz to boost your point is incredibly ironic to me.

(2) Your explanation on the grave of bodies is infuriating.  It ignores the fact that this was again an example of Gunn awkwardly inputting a plot device to move the story along that was just not necessary.  Similar to the part where Gomora questions Mantis about what she was going to say to Drak - we get it, we get it, she has hidden information, jesus.  Anyway, your ""assumptions"" are just silly.  You say that clearly he hadn't been attacked, otherwise (a) he'd be dead, or (b) he'd have cleaned up.  But you neglect the fact that he likely had never been attacked by a being as competent as Peter or as strong as his team.  Either way, you simply have no basis to say he only invited one person at a time and/or had never been attacked.

(3) I'm all about being ""shown"" something.  The difference is when dialogue OR a visual is awkwardly inserted into a movie purely as a plot device.  There were many ways to communicate the same thing - show us hints that Ego has done this ""tour"" before or that Quill's bedroom had been used before, or whatever ... but you just show us a pit of dead bodies?  Come on - be subtle.

(4) Your response to the 30 year issue is silly, and thus ignored.

(5) Ego dropping the news about killing the mother did NOT fit the character.  For someone named Ego, he actually doesn't show much ego at all.  In fact, he's a great host to Quill's friends and seems pretty down to earth when talking to Quill.  So what are you talking about?  At no other point does he say something so crass.  Now your point that Quill's response (immediately shooting) showed his humanity is EXACTLY on point - that's an example of great story telling.  And in fact you should recognize what I'm talking about by contrasting the two.  Quill just IS human while Ego is simply saying shocking things out of no-where - they aren't consistent with the character we see or with the moment they are shared.

(6) First, of course I've seen comic movies before.  Jesus christ, just because I disagree with you doesn't make me a moron.  In any case, look at how they treated infinity stones in the first movie and compare that to how they treat Ego's brain in this movie.  That's my point.  Infinity stones DESERVE explanation and exposition but in GotG 1, they don't receive them and that's cause the audience wasn't treated like stupid idiots who needed to have everything explained - we simply understood they were important.  As for me having to remind you, that's not a sign that the lines weren't so bad, I'm sorry to say this, but its a sign that you're perhaps the type of audience member that Gunn had to dumb down his script for in order to hit over the head with certain themes or information.  Other examples:

* Peter talking about wanting to play catch, then the scene comes later

* Having to be told the gold-race uses remote crafts - just wasn't necessary, could have just shown visuals to get the point across

(7) ""I don't know why anyone would presume this pg-13 action movie is trying to be the next 2001.""  Dude, when GofG 1 came out, it had the hype of one of the old star wars movies.  It wasn't simply another marvel movie - it was a space opera style flick that was bigger in some ways than a marvel movie.  GotG 1 set one hell of an expectation, so yes, I expected one hell of a follow-up.  Sorry, I guess I should have expected less is what you're saying?

(8) I don't think the gold-race losing momentum ""is a loss"" either - I just used it as an example of more lazy story telling.

(9) Not sure your response here.

(10) As for Stallone, my point, which was clear, is that he, the actor, seemed out of place.  All the other characters seemed of that universe - Stallone just seemed to be ""inserted"" in, and his acting didn't portray a character of any description other than ""stallone"" and that was jarring.

http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/the-weta-effect-how-cgi-and-special-effects-saturation-is-ruining-movies-20150703-gi4kws.html

2. Yes RULES OF PHYSICS! You need something to ground you in order to have the suspension of disbelief to enter whatever fantastic world the filmakers are presenting to you. When people are jumping around while a planet is disintegrating around them or there are thousands of drones shooting at you from the sky and none of the main characters gets hurt, you start to feel like you are watching a Warner Bros cartoon or watching someone play a video game. 

3. You can't look past the notion that other people might disagree with you. 
4. It was a cheesy gag that made the movie look even more like a cartoon. The same movie made a point of saying that it took Ego many thousands (millions?) of years to get to that level. 
5. Again, you've made my point for me. It was other actor's performances that added menace to Ego, their acting out their apprehension, not Kurt Russell or how the writers handled his scenes. 
6. Drax was wasted in this film, his role was to be a punchline. He drove the plot in the first film due to his desire for revenge. 
7. Your opinion. 
8. Yondu may not have knowingly sent those kids to their deaths but he abducted countless numbers of them from their famlies and delivered them to someone he had contempt for. He could become Mother effing Theresa and it would not begin to make up for that if you think about what he did.

It's funny I saw reviews saying this made humor the back burner for heart. It didn't at all. It just for more humor into less time.

So hearing it had more heart when it was just a way to fight a giant planet action set piece was lame. 

I totally Agee the with that subplot. Instead of having an action scene of Nebuka trying to kill her where theirs no tension at all why not use all that time to flesh that somewhat...  that being said I think she and Yondu didn't need to be in the movie. Yondu was fine in the first and likable by the end... he interacted with Peter for a few minutes and not we should believe he's like a father to him...?

Ego found life in the universe- but it's all very limited compared to a being like him, and disappointing. Sort of like if mankind got off of earth and explored the universe, only to find every planet full of basic fungi and simple ocean organisms.

To me, the semiotics of those visual cues and what you said don't match. Those things say ""evil."" 

I don't believe that Kurt Russell was as fleshed out as you do. I said it before and I'll say it again: film is a visual medium. A character's dialogue means little compared to his actions. For all we know, if you're willing to give an uncharitable reading (which I will for the sake of argument), it was all an act to seduce Chris Pratt into compliance for his grand scheme. The majority of his actions were in service of his goal. All we have to dispute that claim is a single two minute scene (the prologue) in which he has an ulterior motive. Obviously, that isn't the case, because then why bother telling Pratt about the cancer, why bother asking at all, however, development through exposition belies ambiguity. 

Perhaps I was being glib when I summed up his storyline. Archetypical characters and the Hero's Journey and Joseph Campbell and all that. But I insist that this one is very common and expressed in such uniformity. I just recently finished playing Mass Effect: Andromeda, which was the same thing with aliens. Age of Ultron was the same thing with robots. Any metacommentary on the subject would find that humanity is afraid of anything it perceives as greater than itself.

Apart from himself, or one of Starlords cohort specifically mentioning it during the process (which would come off as clunky and a little too expository... heck, do the rest of the Guardians even know what his Mother looked like?).    

The only real choices he had were an Avatar of himself, which is honestly kind of boring and not as visually interesting... or the previously set up Pac-Man (clearly set up in an earlier line of dialogue). Either would have been suitable but Pac-Man is readily identifiable, easily communicable to the audience and plays on the light-hearted nature of the GoTGs thematic tendencies.    

Using his Mother presents a host of problems and in my opinion, feels a little too heavy-handed and soppy. Just to clarify - The Pac-Man thing wasn't my favourite choice for a few key reasons but it certainly fit Starlords character better than most other things I can imagine...apart from maybe a David Hasslehoff Avatar which (again) would've been kind of hard to communicate visually. It's much easier for me to believe that in the heat of the moment, Pac-Man was the only avatar he could readily and clearly produce in his minds-eye.

Ego has had literally had millions of years to practice speaking to people and he still fucks it up. Not only that but he gets beaten by Peter. An immortal fucking celestial that has existed for millions of years, literally overpowered and destroyed by his half-human son and friends.

Once Ego knew THAT he found Quill real quick and took him into the fold, but until that point Quill was just another disappointment in life to Ego.

As for why he killed the Mother?  Same reason the sailor left Brandi to die alone.  Ego loved her and was fond of her but he was self centered peace of crap who valued his independence over her life and feelings.  Same with the rest of existence.  Also he's immortal and a fancies himself a god.  She's going to die soon anyway, so what's the point of keeping her alive?  It's just as easy to kill her as to ignore her and why not remove the distraction from existence and not have to deal with it ever again?

Yes bring Dormamu and then what? I either forget or never knew, both are bad since I only saw the movie about a month ago. The nurse character I understand is a callback to one of the night nurses in the comics, but she was super pointless in the movie. Might as well just had her in the opening.

I had no problems with any of the casting. Tilda Swinton as the ancient one is perfectly OK with me, Cumberbatch's American accent was decent enough. Rachel McAdams felt shoved in there for the sake of having a woman in the movie, but the scenes she was in she performed well.

I think Dr. Strange's biggest crime is that it's just like the rest of the MCU in that it's painfully average. 'Awful' was probably to strong of a word for me to use originally, because it ISN'T a bad movie... It's just not great.

But it seems to make much less sense in a nolan film where it has to be scanned digitally for all the effects to be added.  And considering the effects matched the film, it just seems like adding film effect to digital recordings works just fine if that is what you want.  Nolan does try to do real effects when he can, but he still also uses a lot of cgi, such as in inception.

And to me, anyone with a young career should be embracing digital.  I feel anyone starting out obsessed with film is just ending their career before it starts.  New filmmakers should be graduating film school having used the same digital camera used in marvel movies with the same digital editing.

dh6t4nc,"> And my argument is that an overarching goal is essential and that the film established it a little late, that's all.

It's not essential. There's a reason why character dramas exist and literally fiction exists. Obviously a film like this can't be 100% a character drama but that doesn't mean it *needs* some established goal since early on.

>Suicide Squad does give us something early on, work in exchange for their sentence. However the entire second act of the movie is them just walking around doing stuff. I didn't feel like the movie was working towards something the entire second act. It wasn't until the third act that the goal came back into light.

This still doesn't make any sense. The goal was established since Enchantress went rogue and the squad is explicitly tasked with stopping her. Everything they do after that *is working towards that goal*, even if it's just fighting random mooks or reaching a certain destination. 

>our argument against it was just ""and frankly you're not even correct in this point."" What kind of rebuttal is that?

Lol can you read? My argument was not just ""you're not even correct in this point"", I clearly listed out why in the sentences afterwards. I'm not twisting your points, you're very clearly twisting mine.

And yet again you contradict yourself. You say there needs to be a ""goal"", then essentially acknowledge that an internal ""goal"" is still a type of goal, but you originally said the film didn't have a goal until late, even though the internal goals were established very early on.

>my argument was that the overarching goal was established pretty late

You're stating a fact here. Your argument was that you needed it to be established earlier. Did you forget your own point...?



>SHOULD have both be accomplished

Lol jesus you don't even understand your own points. 

Okay let me boil it down simply, because I don't know if it's because you're mad or something and not thinking clearly, or you just forgot the main point. You're not even being consistent within your own comments.

You *clearly* are making an argument for there to be an overarching goal since *early* in the film, and I'm saying there doesn't *have to* be one, at least not that early. Are you going to deny this in the next comment? 

>I'm saying that about 2/3 of the movie they neglected the goal, and just showed the characters walking around doing stuff.

You literally said: *""A goal is something to me that is essential for a film. For example I think it's a big reason why Suicide Squad wasn't any good.""*

Stop changing your points. Basic english comprehension will show that means you thought it had no goal. 

> You're making it sound like I'm shitting on the movie or something.

No, I'm not. I just said your points are super contradictory and inconsistent, and now they keep changing.

There doesn't need to be an external goal for the entire film, and first of all, the film also established that the Sovereign are out to get the Guardians for stealing the batteries, that's at least an external threat, and you *know* they will be involved in the climax in some form. There's no need to be an external goal in light of that, you *know* there's going to be conflict at the end of the day, and you knew since very early on.

But this interpretation doesn't exclusively follows from the fact of Ego's existence. He might exist in reality and have no ""inside"" dreams.

Or he might exist in recursive reality: every time Mantis turns him to sleep, he experiences a dream of him being created as a Boltzmann brain in another reality. He lives there a full life, fights inner guardians, being put to sleep by inner Mantis, lives even deeper life in another universe. And after in the main movie the guardians destroyed him, he has awaken in higher layer of the universe to continue searching for his son. And Mantis is a fundamental force of the universe, the gate between layers of universes. And this has been proved by the fact she can read amotions of other people, there are no borders for her. She penetrates other personalities, the borders of ego.

But also, your interpretation doesn't require Ego's existence. We don't need him to exist in person to being unable to distinguish between reality and dream.

For example, we don't know if the guardians observe Ego from imaginary inside (as a part of his universe-scale dream) or from real outside.",69by9z
dh5w5hm,"There might be no difference between the two scenarios you mentioned. The difference starts when we interpret the system as observers.

For example, we can think of the matter permutations inside our universe as a computational process. All matter is a simply a way to define information, and interactions between matter is computations. The laws of physics are just the laws of computations, pure information. From this point of view nothing is actually real here in our universe, everything is a pure information. Or thoughts of the universe-brain.

And when you say ""we might be imagination of a Boltzmann brain"", I'm considering it as a valid way to interpret the reality of our seemingly reaslistic universe.

The opposite approach is to try to disassemble the Boltzmann brain to the basic components: how does it work, what are his thoughts made of. And there's a chance we might find out, his thinking process is a way the information naturally evolves, just alot of pieces of data follow the laws that dictate how these data pieces interact to each other. And this process might fundamentally be indistinguishable from how the matter in our universe works.

So, we simply don't need the concept of Boltzmann brain to create a hypothesis of everything being a projection/imagination. Because we fundamentally can't the difference between matter and information.

And I think Boltzmann brain concept is about a different thing. About the creation of complexity. Is complex shit a result of evolution. Or it is a result of fluctuation. But this again might be a paradoxally unresolvable question. Because the system the evolution happens inside might be a result of fluctuation. But evolution can not exist without fluctuations (here's a bridge lays to [another fundamental mind blowing problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems)).

Though, this all has one more layer. No matter, if we live in a real physical universe or are imagination phantoms of a higher conscious, there's still a distinct difference between our reality and our dreams. They look alike, and inside dreams we usually believe it's real. So when we are sure we are not dreaming, it still might be just a form of complex dreaming where we just falsely convinced we are in reality.",69by9z

dhad8f9,">I don't think this is about applying personal preferences. 

No, it is, you definitely are. You think you’re entitled to a movie that satisfies all your contradictions and blame it all on Gunn. He may very well may be another Hollywood phony or a sellout, but up to at least today, it doesn’t seem like it. He’s obviously very passionate about this project. He did not need to make that facebook post the other day, but he did anyway. The cast seems very proud and grateful, why would they not try their best? Pratt and Bautista give ample evidence of this. No one under the exec level was phoning it in, but greedy execs cannot be helped.

>this was not a movie that was engineered to deliver a tight perspective… The story, characters, and direction just weren't tight
 
Where exactly do you disconnect here? It wasn’t engineered to be the things you’re mad it isn’t. You’re getting bitchy about an apple not being an orange.

>A big fucking blue head is NOT the archetype of fear - its an archetype of cliched fear. The fact you reference the Wizard of Oz to boost your point is incredibly ironic to me.

Yay, you finally found the word you were looking for. Yes, archetypes often and easily become clichés.  I’m really sorry you didn’t know this. No wonder you’re so disappointed by otherwise fun movies. Archetypes still get the job done though. Going back to 1939 with Oz (which is undisputedly groundbreaking, I don’t know why you’re shitting yourself over that fact) only supports my point.

>Your explanation on the grave of bodies is infuriating. It ignores the fact that this was again an example of Gunn awkwardly inputting a plot device to move the story along that was just not necessary. Similar to the part where Gomora questions Mantis about what she was going to say to Drak - we get it, we get it, she has hidden information, jesus. Anyway, your ""assumptions"" are just silly. You say that clearly he hadn't been attacked, otherwise (a) he'd be dead, or (b) he'd have cleaned up. But you neglect the fact that he likely had never been attacked by a being as competent as Peter or as strong as his team. Either way, you simply have no basis to say he only invited one person at a time and/or had never been attacked.

Ok first of all, if you’re infuriated, seek professional help. If you’re done being a drama queen, “no basis” is exactly the point. There was no basis for Ego to have defenses given, it was smartly left open, so viewers can make varied and probable assumptions as to why.

>I'm all about being ""shown"" something. The difference is when dialogue OR a visual is awkwardly inserted into a movie purely as a plot device. There were many ways to communicate the same thing - show us hints that Ego has done this ""tour"" before or that Quill's bedroom had been used before, or whatever ... but you just show us a pit of dead bodies? Come on - be subtle.

None of these characters or settings have ever been subtle. It’s gonna use unsubtle plot devices. Your ideas are equally common and much more boring. This isn’t Shyamalan or Fincher, it’s not a mystery movie, the main point isn’t being smart enough to guess the twist before everyone else. This is you expecting something you should not have and blaming a movie for not being what it never claimed or tried to be.  Again, *wide audience*, NOT *just you specifically* audience. This could be some 10 year-old's first rodeo, there is no shame in putting in such exposition for the entire range of the demographic, products need to be accessible, and their money is just as good as yours. Those who need it appreciate it and those who don’t can easily look beyond it.

>Your response to the 30 year issue is silly, and thus ignored.

“I obviously see it's an easily explained non-issue now, so I’m ignoring you” Got it.

>Ego dropping the news about killing the mother did NOT fit the character. For someone named Ego, he actually doesn't show much ego at all. In fact, he's a great host to Quill's friends and seems pretty down to earth when talking to Quill. So what are you talking about? At no other point does he say something so crass. Now your point that Quill's response (immediately shooting) showed his humanity is EXACTLY on point - that's an example of great story telling. And in fact you should recognize what I'm talking about by contrasting the two. Quill just IS human while Ego is simply saying shocking things out of no-where - they aren't consistent with the character we see or with the moment they are shared.

This is just such a mess it’s hard to know where to even start.

You do know he was a great host of out manipulation, right?? The whole thing down to earth nice guy thing was a rehearsed and repeated con? He lulls them in while he feels them out. His two aims are more power and companionship, in that order. As soon as it’s clear he can’t gain anything from them he is remorseless about their death.  Peter was proving to be useful but noncompliant. It was unfathomable to him that Peter wouldn’t want in on what he was offering or that anything he did wasn’t above reproach (you know, *egotistical*). The unexpected resistance baffled and angered him, so it was not out of nowhere. Not only do all people say stuff they shouldn’t in that state, but a cold egotistical character who thinks he can do whatever he wants (kill the mom) and smugly own it (admit to killing the mom) does so because he believes there could never be any negative consequences for someone as amazing and omnipotent as he believes himself to be. That is a great depiction of ego.

>First, of course I've seen comic movies before. Jesus christ, just because I disagree with you doesn't make me a moron. In any case, look at how they treated infinity stones in the first movie and compare that to how they treat Ego's brain in this movie. That's my point. Infinity stones DESERVE explanation and exposition but in GotG 1, they don't receive them and that's cause the audience wasn't treated like stupid idiots who needed to have everything explained - we simply understood they were important. As for me having to remind you, that's not a sign that the lines weren't so bad, I'm sorry to say this, but its a sign that you're perhaps the type of audience member that Gunn had to dumb down his script for in order to hit over the head with certain themes or information.

Actually that just makes the stones a pretty laughable mcguffin, but I figured such refined smart viewers like you were in on the joke like the rest of us. Needing a reminder clearly proves the lines are inconsequential to most viewers and considerate to those who need them. Again, those who need it appreciate it and those who don’t can easily look beyond it. And *I’m sorry to say* this is you again thinking this movie should be specifically for you and not a wider audience. It’s just delusional and entitled. 

> ""I don't know why anyone would presume this pg-13 action movie is trying to be the next 2001."" Dude, when GofG 1 came out, it had the hype of one of the old star wars movies. It wasn't simply another marvel movie - it was a space opera style flick that was bigger in some ways than a marvel movie. GotG 1 set one hell of an expectation, so yes, I expected one hell of a follow-up. Sorry, I guess I should have expected less is what you're saying?

The hype of Star Wars? Says who?? That’s your limited cherry picked experience, no worries we all have them, but we gotta recognize it. I *am* saying, just as advice, don't ever expect the phenomenon that is Star Wars and you won't be wasting your own time so much.
	
>(8) I don't think the gold-race losing momentum ""is a loss"" either - I just used it as an example of more lazy story telling. 
(9) Not sure your response here.

^^^   just more evidence that your sweeping claim “we deserve better” is easily refutable. It's unfounded expectations to hold against a fun sequel, which rarely capture the magic of the first one anyway. Petty personal issues, don’t say “we” deserve better when you really mean special ol’ you. (Don’t say deserve for that matter, so entitled.) 

> As for Stallone, my point, which was clear, is that he, the actor, seemed out of place. All the other characters seemed of that universe - Stallone just seemed to be ""inserted"" in, and his acting didn't portray a character of any description other than ""stallone"" and that was jarring. Compare that to Batista. 

Please, you were not clear. You didn’t say what you meant the first time since you keep adding additional CLARIFICATION. Who cares. It’s fine. But once more, caring so much about Stallone is a personal issue. This franchise has easter eggs, cameos, random introductions to future projects… Unless you know all the comics, you probably don’t know who Starhawk is, Stallone is a familiar face to guide you in. Josh Brolin was just as random as Thanos, did you whine about that?

Also, just curious why would you whine about being downvoted instead of being debated with and then be so bitchy when you are?

dhgyevf,"1. It's overkill when not needed and extremely noticeable. But it's most definitely needed in a film like this set mainly in space. Thanks for the article from 2 years ago...CGI has developed a lot in that time.

2. Then why did you see this movie after seeing the first one? Were you expecting something different? No we're not watching a WB cartoon, we're watching a Disney made Marvel Sci-Fi Comic Book movie. Gamora and Drax aren't human, and they're tough as fucking nails. But AGAIN I'VE ALREADY ADDRESSED THIS IN MY FIRST RESPONSE!

3. Can you? It's the artists creative concept not yours. It's like going concert and yelling at the band to play softer because you don't like loud music.

4. The movie was like a cartoon, so was the first one! It took him millions of years to form a planet, but he also stats he realized that he could control matter after such time. Quill realized instantly when Ego showed him how to. He also wasn't creating anything, just manipulating what was already created. And we're led to believe his emotions/heart are what stand different between him and Ego, and that's another reason why we're led to think he would be able to control it better. Quill is the only special one out of so many of Ego's offspring, so we're led to believe he's born for greatness. 

5. It's everyone's effort! Ego's nonchalant candor/narcissism of the situation mixed with the other's skepticism created the tension. It was not one sided. 

6. Hmmm I guess he developed from his blind rage...he went from being the butt of the joke to making them.

7. Keep on being frigid over a quick 2 secs of screen time. Why aren't you bitching about Drax being shirtless? Or would that ruin your suspension of disbelief?

8. It doesn't erase his past, but he can still change and do good.

9. Don't know the fine details, but I know they all signed on for multi-picture deals, as well I do know the SAG rules. Marvel has it so everyone that signs onto their franchise films now sign on for multi-picture contracts. It's to help prevent the actors raising their price after each movie. Marvel learned their mistake with RDJ and Iron man, he made $500,000 on the first one and then charged them $10,000,000 for the 2nd, then $50,000,000 for the 3rd and Avengers. As well Vin Diesel loved playing Groot so much that he did all the voice in all the languages the film was released in. Again Why do you care who does the voice?

10. Meh, don't go into a Marvel film expecting Pulitzer Prize writing. It's pretty par for the course with how many movies they've already made.

He's a character as a prop for the emotional throughline of the film which is the intent of the writer. If you're not getting the relationship dynamics and don't feel them, then, yes, you are missing something because these relationship dynamics tend to be fairly universal. Most people don't have perfect relationships with their parents, and the issue within the film of the family you were born with and the family you find for yourself is something that does resonate with a lot of people. 

If you don't feel that or see that you're not superior somehow to those that do. You just haven't had the same experiences that allow for that resonance to occur. ",69by9z

But there was something missing. First of all, I thought there was a lot of development the group needed to go through as a group – and it would be a shame for the audience to miss it. And, secondly, for whatever reason, Groot just wasn’t working. **It was then I came upon the idea of having Vol. 2 take place very shortly after the first film and for Groot to still be Baby Groot, with quite a lot to learn.** Even though I had already long-ago-decided on the other characters involved, this change opened up the whole movie for me and it suddenly all came together. I fell in love with the script for Vol. 2, and I felt like we were creating something very special.

The fact that he shape-shifted into Pratt's childish imagining of ""an ideal dad"" while talking about trying to be a good father shows that he didn't even really understand what it meant to be a father beyond what a kid imagines a good father to be.

First, I was abundantly clear about Stallone.  I am adding clarification because, like Gunn, I now realize there are less adept viewers who may need extra help being told the obvious.  I stated ""Sly stallone - I LOVE this man, but he just seemed so out of place in this movie.""  At NO point do I refer to his character.  I refer to ""this man"" and ""he"" as being out of place.  I am clearly referring to the actor, not his character.  Now I understand why Gunn felt the need to explain everything.

dhh0zlp,"1. CGI has been overused alot in 2 years as well. It isn't like the problem has gone away. 
2. I enjoyed the first, I was hoping for the same. 
3. So nobody is allowed to disagree with an artists creative concept or interpretation of something. Why are there movie critics or reviews then?
4. It was a dumb gag that was trying too hard.
5. There was little or no tension or menace from Ego himself. It was Kurt Russel basically playing Kurt Russel.
6. He doesn't need to have blind rage all the tim but in this film it was if the writers sat around and said ""what stupid thing can Drax say here that might get a laugh.
7. It's not being frigid, I pointed something out. It was as silly and unneeded as the scene they shoehorned into the first Star Trek reboot with the female officer in her undies ""just because"".
8. Doesn't make me want to buy into his ""redemption"" either. 
9. Said all I am gonna say about that. 
10. So if someone points out bad writing that means they expect ""pulitzer prize"" writing? Why can't the writing be as good as the last movie or as good as a well done superhero movie? That is an asinine comment. I'm not expecting the ""best picture"" nomination but I could do without all of the ""on the nose"" exposition telling us what the characters are feeling instead of showing us because they wanted to cram in more CGI shots or dumb pac-man gags.

dhpi5c4,"Well, truth be told, it wasn't even a twist. It wasn't even a reveal. It was a pointless spur of the moment addition. Nothing hints at it, it happens for no reason, and doesn't really impact the story any more meaningfully than any other ""reveal"" they could have put in its place. It was an afterthought designed as an OH SHIT moment to get people interested in seeing the next one. 

Also, goes against something specifically established in the previous movie. 

Now, because of this, the X IS Y'S RELATIVE! is a staple go-to twist in movies that happens for reasons and is usually meant as a shocker even though it doesn't matter. For a particularly bad example of this, see Prometheus.

Not only that, but it led to them having to of course up the ante in the next movie, when it was revealed that the kiss that Luke and Leia shared previously had now become incestuous. Like why. What was the point... other than trying to out do the previous dumb familiar relationship reveal.

dh9apt4,"I dont think its that arbitrary if out of what appears to be hundreds of offspring and couplings he only really had an emotional attachment to one. It means there was only one woman he developed an attachment to for whatever chemical or intellectual reasons she was pretty dam cute, that is how attraction works, some people you just are into and others you aren't. He was unused to being dominated by his affections and didn't view them as a good thing. The fact he loved her didn't make him compassionate, he still has the same psychological problems. He had to go the extend of going away, then compartmentalising her death because he felt bad. 

Murderers aren't all sitting around pained by guilt, very many of them, especially sociopaths are highly adept at charming people and functioning in the world. If you try to look at it from a rational pov you aren't going to figure it out because hes not a rational being, hes fucking crazier then a bag of cats. ",69by9z

dh5vf2o,"Yea, not the Hollywood. Even though, the concentration of good writers is so high there, they could invent new meanings behind evil deeds if there was a request.

Ego's seemed fair enough too. He doesn't really know anything about *being* human rather than pretending too.

Ego can't really sympathize with human nature so doesn't understand *how* profound Peter's love for his mother was.

Because there are no real villains in the first 90 minutes of this film, and that's one of its problems. But heroes need conflict, and so these two groups fill that void.

By comparison, the Collector is NEVER an antagonist. He hires our heroes, separately, to do a job and once they complete the job his slave girls blows them all up! His main purpose is expositional. His entire scene is just to explain the initiatory stones for Christ's sake! 

And before we meet him we already know who all the villains are! Ronan, Thanos, Nebula, even Yondu seems like a villain up until this point. 

The Collector is way down the list of possible villains in that film. Near last.

But we know that he feels guilty about what happened in Avengers 2, so he's growing to be more careful so more people don't get hurt. Therefor, his conflict with Steve makes sense, because it is a logical extension of the character growth we've seen. In GotG vol. 2, the behavior of the characters clearly contradicts the character growth we've seen. There's a difference between playful banter and flat out selfishness when it contradicts the way the writers have previously developed the character.
