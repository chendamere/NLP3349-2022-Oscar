I'll just say I can now fully understand why the Germans put the sirens into the Stuka bombers, because when they were on the bombing runs, I was in a constant state of ""fuck, fuck, fuck, FUCK."" That shit was terrifying.

I also loved how they had the perspective of an Allied ship in the Atlantic where all the U-boats were lurking. All you had was a ""TORPEDO"" warning and that's all enough reaction time you have before it hits.

dki6ics,"If I could describe this movie with one word it would be:

Stress.


This movie has made me more nervous to watch than any horror movie I've seen within the last few years.  Just when you think the characters are safe you get thrown right back into war. I never really feel this way about any movie because most movies have an overwhelming amount of plot armor but  this one felt like no one was truly safe. ",6ol0kp
dkik5z8,"I loved this movie. One thing that stood out for me in this film was how realistic the dogfights were.

Here are a few details that I loved about the air sequences: 

- The aircraft didn't shoot 100% accurate laser rounds that cause planes to explode violently after one hit. Also they were firing in short bursts. Finally a dogfight in cinema where pilots are actually being cautious with their ammo consumption. Similarly monitoring things like fuel, manifold pressure and engine.

- The difficulty to get guns on target was so well portrayed. It took patience and skill to get those rounds to hit and it really showed in these dogfights. 

- The maneuverability of the aircraft was realistic. You could see them pulling G's and the planes weren't turning on a dime (even though they are Spits) or doing aileron rolls every 3 secs.

- The sounds of the aircraft in flight was phenomenal. I have been in a warbird myself and immediately recognized some sounds. Things like the prop stutter and the creaking and shaking metal. These are small details but don't go unnoticed and really add to the feeling of being right there in the cockpit with these guys.

Aside from these minor details that I loved so much, all of the air sequences were so beautifully shot. I have never seen anything like it.

Of course I loved every aspect of the film, but the air scenes took my breath away.",6ol0kp
dkjbifz,"I see a lot of commentary on the lack of characterization, and normally, my enjoyment of a movie hinges on having at least a couple well-developed characters that I can care about. To my surprise, in Dunkirk, I really liked the complete lack of backstories, or even names in some cases. Especially for the three boys who start on the beach, it showed how war strips away your humanity and identity. It didn't matter what their names were, or where they came from, or who was waiting for them back home. The only thing that mattered was getting off that beach, and a remarkable amount of characterization came out of that. When each of the boys met each other, they instantly recognized a certain kinship that set them apart: they were all clever, they had their wits about them, and they were willing to do whatever it took (or almost) to survive. In the end, I didn't need to know anything more about them to care about them and whether they made it out. Well done, Nolan, and young actors whose names I don't remember (except Harry Styles because I don't yet live under a rock).",6ol0kp
dki65nd,"If you're even thinking about watching the movie, do it before it leaves theaters. The sound was FUCKING UNREAL in IMAX. Literally from the first minute to the last, the sound was on point and kept you into it especially with constant clock ticking in the intense scenes. Also didn't expect the three different timelines, but I liked it especially when you could see previous events from another perspective like when the bomber is seen making a run on the ship from the civilian boats perspective.

dkk3amw,"Just a small thing. The sound design in this was amazing. 

It being so loud and painful was a really great stylistic move. I think my 'favorite' part was hearing the Jericho Trumpets on the stuka. That whining sound has become the default 'diving plane' sound and every one knows it when they hear it. To the point that its not a scary sound at all.

The sound design in this movie really reclaimed that noise. You really felt deep dread at hearing it in this movie. It wasn't a default plane noise anymore, its was shrieking death.",6ol0kp

dkirlo4,"This may be the best ""show don't tell"" movie I've ever seen. Tom Hardy had an entire character arc expressed with facial acting. The Navy commander had an arc. The british teenager had an arc. Soldiers don't talk, there's nothing to talk about. There is only waiting until they return home or die. 

The opening is terrifying and necessary. Why are they all on the beach instead of holding the mainland? Well, because they are ill equipped, outnumbered, and being wiped out by the dozens. The only chance any man has is to run, and hope to be the lucky survivor. 

There is a noticeable lack of reaction shots to the carnage, which was haunting. Men die by the dozens, they are put on stretchers, they line back up, and the grind continues. Every soldier is hoping against hope that it's not their turn, but every one seems convinced that their turn is coming next. 

And just like a good horror film, I learned new things to be afraid of. The idea that the hold of a ship is the LAST place you'd want to be, but that you HAVE to go below to fit enough men on board is absolutely terrifying. Lots of war films concern themselves with showing drownings, but this film shows you the type of man that knows the risks and drowns anyways. It was these soldiers' duty to each other to save as many lives as possible by violating every survival instinct they had. That scares me to the core. Also, floating deadstick in a plane above the enemy that will kill/capture you when you land is crazy to think about. 

This is the type of war movie I never thought I'd get to see. It's gritty, but not ""actiony"". It's grim, but still personable. It's smart, but not masturbatory or self-reverential. Loved every minute of Dunkirk, and I can't wait to see it again. ",6ol0kp

dki5zg1,"I think this is gonna go down as one of Nolan's most mature movies. There's no bullshit, just tense action and beautiful visuals. It's not a quiet movie by any means but there's also very little dialogue.

I was intrigued by the structure of it. It basically follows three stories, one of soldiers on the beach trying to get off, one of air Force pilots keeping the skies clear, and the civilian ship coming to save as many as they can. Each story has its own arc and characters and struggles but all that takes background to the overall disaster that is the death. So whole there are stories and characters it does a great job of depicting just how miniscule they are to the big picture. I also loved the way time is handled. The ticking clock is ever present in the score but each story starts at a different point. The beach story is a week before the climax, civilian ship is a day before, and the pilot story is an hour before. So it's really well done how it skips between stories constantly but their times sync up for the ending.

I think the most powerful moments were seeing Cillian in the lifeboat giving orders before the war broke him, Tom Hardy saving the beach and giving himself up to the Germans at the end, and the kid on the civilian ship making the paper. I also loved how they had the kid read the Churchill speech at the end. While I didn't connect with the movie as emotionally as, say, Interstellar, I did end up loving it way more than Interstellar by the end. Although they are obviously different movies.

I'm interested to see how this does with general audiences and at the box office. Part of me says it's a little intense for the summer crowd. It's all last half of Titanic with the impressive disaster filmmaking and none of the cliche characters or romance. I'd say 8/10.

dki6l0k,"This has got to be easily the best movie for shaving a couple years off your life, just from the stress of it all.",6ol0kp
dkiqco1,"Spoilers.....

I think my favorite thing was how it didn't use any bullshit military movie cliches. No redemption for Cillian Murphy. Tom Hardy didn't clear the Cliffs of Dover by 2 inches and land his out of fuel plane on friendly soil, nor did he die a heroic on screen death. The suspense around getting his gear down, doing his duty by burning the plane then becoming a POW with no other resolution was the exact opposite of a Michael Bay version. There was no corporal saluting Tom Cruise's court room bravery or Matt Damon saluting a tombstone or any other forced effort to show reverence and respect by having an actor snap to and fire off the stiffest salute they could muster. God I hate cliched salutes in military movies.

We see stoic bravery (as British bravery should be represented haha) yet we also see the cowardice and fear that is played out along an entire arc. Some movies will show an act of cowardice, or a soldier scared and overly dramatically calling for his momma, but then the movie gets right back to the heroing that need to be done. 

We start with Tommy doing whatever he can to get out of Dunkirk and then he spends the rest of the movie doing the same thing while...sorry, whilst his fellow soldiers calmly queue on the beach. Cillian Murphy looking back and seeing George's body being pulled off the boat and turning and disappearing in to the crowd was jarring to me. ",6ol0kp

dkjnj6m,"Just got out. I was very moved through out the entire film. The cinematography is superb. The sound effects and score are both A pluses. But I lost about 70% of the dialogue to the aggressive score and sound. I'm not sure what Nolan's goal was, but I wish the film had subtitles. It sounded like it was coming through a can. 

I was sort of over Zimmer after Batman and Superman. I felt for the past few years that his work was sounding the same. It's almost more like mood music than a traditional score. Boy was I wrong. The score for this film is exemplary. It was truly an extra character in the film. 

One thing I definitely caught that I wanted to applaud Nolan on was *you never really saw the enemy*. Towards the beginning, one of the ship's was being attacked, and I'm conditioned as a viewer to expect to see the enemy ship shooting it's cannons. But you don't get that, just like the real soldiers didn't get that. Even when the little ship is being shot up, you never see where it's coming from, and it makes it 10 times more terrifying. An incredible choice by the filmmakers. 

A few parts of the film brought tears to my eyes. Especially Hardy's moments. Great film, but hopefully the sound will be fixed for DVDs or I'll watch it in subtitles next time. ",6ol0kp

In the scene where Mark Rylance character is sailing to Dunkirk and a two engined aircraft flies low over his boat, he says ""don't worry, it's one of ours"".

The aircraft that flew over was a Bristol Blenheim. This was an early war British light bomber, and there are only (I think) two surviving examples left in the world.

I love that they got in ones of these, just to fly over the boat and to generate about two line of dialogue. The plane is never seem again. It really serves no narrative purpose, but it has probably made plane spotters all over the world smile!!",6ol0kp
dklmccb,"Just got back from seeing it.  One of the most intense PG-13 films I've ever seen, and an absolutely amazing film.  They absolutely nailed the Stuka's sirens, not to mention all the other sound effects, too; if this film doesn't get at least nominated for an Oscar in sound design, it will be a shame.  The actors were all great, and it was refreshing to have most of them be relative unknowns.  

The best part was the cinematography though.  Everything from the sweeping shots of soldiers waiting for boats at the beach to the relative intimacy of a rescue ship's cabin was intricately detailed and full of life.  Massive, massive respect to Nolan for having actual planes do the dog fights instead of just phoning it in with CGI like too many directors would've done.  Bonus points for actually filming at Dunkirk, too.  

Nolan perfectly captured the dual despair and hope within the events at Dunkirk, and as a massive WW2 nerd, I hope this film gets the love and money it deserves.

Visually/technically it was awesome, really great cinematography and special effects, anxiety-inducing editing (in a good way), really cool flying and dogfighting shots. I also actually liked the super loud gunshots and explosions, really made me feel like I was right there.

But the story didn't really grab me like I was hoping it would. At times it almost felt like I was just watching a montage of WWII footage or a documentary or something, rather than a ""movie."" It was a little too dry for me.

dkxwa1u,"I know everybody is complaining about the lack of character development, but that's what made the movie work. The whole point of the movie was the collective. About getting everyone off that beach to avoid disaster. 

Nolan instead gave us tiny snapshots of all the characters, then lets the viewer ""fill in the blank"" around it. For example, Rylance's character, who was a steady ""stiff upper lip"" type the whole time, only got emotional after wanting to rescue the downed pilot. We found out later that his son was also a pilot, killed earlier in the war.  It seemed like everyone had a tiny moment like this. A kernel that allows the viewer to build a backstory around that character and make them relatable.

What does this accomplish? This lets us marry the scale of the operation with the personal tragedies. When anyone dies on the screen, a small piece of the collective dies, because you get a sense that they all have a story, and they are all a tragedy in itself. Nobody gets the special treatment. In other movies, where the protagonists' characters are excessively built, you get a sense of detachment from all the other deaths and casualties, because you're so focused on the protagonist's story and survival. Everybody else is just a blank slate that dies, and you get numb to it.",6ol0kp

Also they nailed the sound of the Stukas and their Jericho trumpets, which are designed to instill even more fear as they dive on you. They captured that perfectly. It was my first 70mm experience too so all the scenes with the Spitfires were gorgeous. All in all, my favorite movie of the year and a top 10 or so all time for me.

Only criticisms as others pointed out is the scale wasn't quite as it could have been. There were over 600 vessels involved in that evacuation but it didn't really seem like it in the movie, probably because it was hard to get more period correct boats. Also I feel they underrepresented the RAF's role in this. They made it seem like they were hardly involved for preparations of the next big battle, [but in reality they were](https://www.brentbaxterbooks.com/the-role-of-the-raf-in-operation-dynamo-the-miracle-of-dunkirk/).

* Major props to Nolan for not showing the enemy at any point (I believe they’re blurred at the end when arresting Hardy) and making them a horrific looming presence. It made the fear of the soldiers that much more authentic.

* This film almost feels like a response to all of the criticisms Nolan’s received as a filmmaker. There’s very little dialogue, it’s a tight hour forty five, and the action is much more coherent than his previous works.

* On the other side of that though, while the sound design was good, the mixing is still horrific (picture the Damon explosion from Interstellar spread out over an entire film) and Branagh seems to have ended up as the expository dumper.

* All that aside, I think this is Nolan’s strongest film since The Dark Knight and I’m excited to see how it holds up on a rewatch.

* And my lord, how have we only had Rylance in the mainstream since Wolf Hall?",6ol0kp
dllio6q,"I think it's odd to read the most criticisms here, which all boil down to wanting it to be more like a conventional war movie (or just more conventional storytelling altogether).

I do think Nolan could have gone that route and made a perfectly good film about Dunkirk.  He could have shown more of the Germans.  He could have narrowed it down to a few protagonists.  He could have had the classic story of heroism and personal growth as the protagonists embark on a specific task/adventure. He could have gone with more dialogue and character moments (through hackneyed flashback sequences or whatever).

All of this would have probably been perfectly okay.  But he took a home run swing and went with something much more experimental, and I thought his reasoning for this was pretty clear by the end: this is NOT a classic ""hero's plot arc"" story.  It just doesn't fit that mold.  You could see in the conclusion that most of the fighters felt like cowards and failures.

If you went into this expecting a big, flashy moment of glory, this story just wasn't going to provide that.  Even Tom Hardy's climactic finish was getting captured and being forced to serve out the next FIVE YEARS in a P.O.W. camp.  That was the reality.  

To paraphrase Churchill, you don't win wars by retreating.  And, yet, there was a humble, understated glory in this moment.  This was a movie about duty above all else - just many small people doing the small things asked of them.  I guess that's ""boring"" to some, I don't know.

dkm5jb4,"I went in REALLY excited knowing Nolan was working with Zimmer and Hoyte Van Hoytema, the same guys who did the music and cinematography for Interstellar, I was hoping it would be a similar style but in a war setting.

It was to an extent, Zimmer and Hoyte Van Hoytema were great, the music and picture was incredible throughout especially at the start, but then the film got repetitive and even a little boring.

I think the film was as good as a film about Dunkirk could be, but the whole idea of a film about people on a beach being evacuated seems difficult to keep exciting and refreshing throughout.

The scenes started to feel 'samey', people dramatically looking up at a plane with loud un-nerving music in the background, and watching people swim from one boat to another.

Nolan did okay, but I feel the premise of the whole film limited him, he couldn't really break out of what Dunkirk was, an evacuation. There was no depth.

dlfbasn,"Honestly, for me this is easily one of Nolan's best, up there with Memento and The Dark Knight. One of the major issues I have with films like Inception or Interstellar is that sometimes, his grand visionary style grows to uncontrollable proportions and the films become too reliant on complex plot, rather than complex themes, characters, or story. 

Here, everything fits in perfectly. Nolan doesn't try to develop complicated backstories for the characters or integrate important themes/meanings about war into the film. He simply makes a film about survival during a total clusterfuck event. Plus a lot of the huge and ridiculously tense sequences in Inception & Interstellar really just become too much to handle at points. Here, it's sheer reality - this shit actually happened. 

Also loved the way the timelines were crafted here. Made for a very unique experience that was not really hard to follow once you got used to it, and that ended up coming together perfectly. ",6ol0kp

Comparing Saving Private Ryan (our biggest WWII film) to Dunkirk (now the biggest British WWII film): the American film places total emphasis on devotion and emotional attachment between soldiers, their family, their spouses. Dunkirk had this very cold approach to ""duty."" Each character does their part in the effort and seems to do it with little regard as to whether or not the person or people they are helping matters to them personally. All that mattered was the strategic objective, evacuate as many men as possible. In fact, I don't remember a single time in Dunkirk where anybody seemed disturbed by someone near them violently dying, you could almost say Cillian Murphy's character but he shoves George Mills down those steps and just hunkers back down and keeps to himself. In American war movies there is a lot of focus on the emotional impact of losing someone next to you. Lots of screaming, lots of crying. Dunkirk was the total opposite.

dkjdhde,"To me it was a very British war movie. It's about surviving a painful retreat keeping your resolve 

Trailer made it look more tense and exciting but it had that strange silent despair which feels kinda British. Atmosphere of tired defeat. There are explosions and gunfire but it's sandwiched with shell shocked survival. Even when the little ships came in the cheer felt sweet and British. Everything felt ordinary and everyday, the ships and dog fights felt real in a cold way. Had a relative at Dunkirk and I think casting made it feel than an old photo too real given how young everyone was. It's also amazing what they filmed with real ships, none of it felt fake.

I think if you want an intense fly on the wall film Bloody Sunday will hit you harder. This is more of a drama with long gaps of waiting. I think the film hit that atmosphere of waiting. The soundtrack melded beautifully

There is not a whole lot of dialogue or character development, because that is not what is about.  These events happen quickly, it's a short film and I feel like it got its point across quickly.   Cinematically it was a masterpiece. Between the shots from the sea, land and air mixed with the score from Han Zimmer it was possible to experience the Battle of Dunkirk.  It was the turning point of the war.  The french got obliterated and the brits were pinned down, but they didn't give up.

dl3tajx,"Overall, an interesting experiment, with moments of beauty or terror. Helping to pioneer that new ""it's just one big action scene"" genre. But I can't ignore the many flaws.

* Scale: It feels almost impolite to mention this, but the film's scale seems grossly incommensurate to the historical event - or at least, the way I've always imagined it. The beach is never filled with men, the sky is never filled with planes (which may be out of historical accuracy, to be fair) and the sea is never filled with ships (even when the little ships arrive, somehow the spectacle - while moving - is less impressive than one would imagine). Again, some of this could just be a matter of historical accuracy (perhaps most of the men were elsewhere?). How much came from a desire to only show what the individual soldiers saw (but surely some of them had a good enough view of the beach some of the time to have taken in vast crowds of soldiers?) and how much if any came from an irrational aversion to the use of CGI? Whatever the truth, I think the lack of a sense of scale lets the film down.

* Repetition: the cycle of ""men get on a boat -> boat gets sunk -> men swim back to shore or to another boat"" got repeated often enough that I began to lose track and my interest started to wane. Likewise with the dogfights.

* The film fails to convince us of the urgency of the situation - that unless they evacuate the beach *very soon* they'll be overrun and all of them will die or be captured. Perhaps it would have helped to show some of the land-based fighting.

I can't hate it though. Just look at that shot with Mark Rylance's boat heading into danger with the destroyer in the background sailing the opposite way.

Seeing the look on the men's faces--you could easily see they were thinking, *This is it. This is when I die.*](#spoiler) The beginning of the movie set a great tone for the rest of the film. 

And we all should understand what Nolan was trying to do (he said as much). He wanted it to be experiential. He wanted the viewers to feel like they were there. And Nolan achieved that spectacularly, except in one area. If Nolan really wanted to make us feel we were in the middle of the battle, it should have been rated R. Normally I'm the last person to care if a movie has violence or a lack of it, but there were moments in the movie where I completely lost my suspension of disbelief. The terror that let up to German bombers coming to attack (man that sound!) ended in no blood. I didn't expect to feel this way when I was watching the movie, because when they announced it to be PG-13, I didn't care at all, but when people got shot or were hit with a bomb, it didn't feel like I was at Dunkirk anymore. It felt like I was watching a depiction of Dunkirk, rather than experiencing Dunkirk as it happened (Nolan's goal). I felt this was the only way that Nolan failed in this regard. Otherwise, I felt like I was experiencing what was happening on the screen--it was pretty fascinating.

That said, I didn't find really find that medium of storytelling conducive for an engaging movie. As the movie went on, my interest began to wain. The movie started so well, but the characters didn't really have any qualities that made me want to root for or against them. In fact, none of them really expressed any real positive or negative qualities. I've noticed that some people weren't even sure what some main character's motivations even were. Farrier? A pilot doing his job. Mr. Dawson? A regular man doing what he feels he ought. George? A kid who just wants to be involved too. And that's it. There wasn't anything deeper than that. The characters in this movie were all surface level. There are a few exceptions to this, but generally speaking, this movie lacked any real attempt to generate any development of its characters. And even the exceptions were nothing truly meaningful.

I'm pretty certain Nolan did all of this intentionally. The movie was meant to be experiential. The characters weren't meant to be fully fleshed out. However, doing this intentionally doesn't mean the story was actually good for it. The story wasn't especially captivating. The spectacle is what was captivating. Over the course of the movie, this spectacle becomes repetitive and stale, with no story or characters to really hold it together. I was disappointed with that. 

While I would call this an overall good movie, it isn't one of Nolan's best works, in my opinion. I can definitely respect what he was trying to accomplish, and I think he achieved that. I just didn't feel it was a good storytelling choice.

dl5wdi4,I found the atmosphere and everything quite good but one thing i felt was off was the sense of scale. It did not feel like there were 300k people waiting to be rescued and the handful of boats showing up for rescue seemed almost funny in how few they showed.,6ol0kp
dl61snp,"Had this film been exactly the same but directed by anyone other than Nolan, so many of the squabbles and nit-picky criticisms about this movie would be eradicated. From what I've gathered everyone is more hung up on the fact that it 'doesn't compare to his other works' it is entirely different to his other works, and therefore not comparable, but that doesn't mean it isn't just as good, if not better than some or all, for the type of movie it is.",6ol0kp

dlt3gk0,"I thought it was excellent, but I have a few small questions, mostly thematic.

For example: What was the significance of the last shot? It fades on the burning fighter plane, then cuts to the soldier closing the paper, looking somewhat fed up. It's maybe a two second shot, it seemed like an odd inclusion.

Why didn't Tom Hardy's pilot parachute onto the beach? Some are saying it was a defiant display of hope for the soldiers, never seeing the plane crash, sailing triumphantly overhead, but honestly I'd have been happier greeting this hero. To see him glide down would've been plenty inspirational.

Lastly, the part of the movie that stood out most to me was when the two soldiers arrived home, before they got on the train. Harry Style's soldier is downtrodden, saying ""he couldn't even look us in the eye."" The other soldier is already asleep, so unable to console him and let him know the man was blind. The obvious meaning here is that Style's soldier has left feeling a failure, while the other is content to be alive and safe. But it feels there's something deeper below the surface I'm missing?

Discuss, I suppose.",6ol0kp
dkt09dn,"Really not understanding the hate for this movie right now. The chief complaint i'm seeing is ""there were no characters"" or ""i didn't care that any of them died"". Like do we really want another guts and glory war film with exaggerated personalities and cringy minutes-long monologues about how the soldiers miss their mum or how they have a newborn waiting for them at home? We've heard all that shit a hundred million times before already. This movie told its story realistically (to a point) and portrayed the horror of war without needing to beat us over the head with stereotypes, done-to-death war movie tropes or even character names for that matter.",6ol0kp
dkigy7e,"Overall I liked the film. It's shot really well and the scenes with the planes, and the ocean in full view, are amazing. The story is pretty bare bones, which isn't a bad thing in this case.  I guess you can think of it as a sort of stylized/dramatized documentary. I say that mostly because Dunkirk seems more about giving an overview of the whole event rather than focusing in on any particular soldier or platoon and his/their struggles. What I mean is that while you follow a group of characters in each of the three ""fronts"", it felt more like they were a vehicle to show you the events of Dunkirk rather than it being about the characters themselves with Dunkirk as the background, if that makes sense. Personally, I think the cinematography being as great as it is, is what really makes this movie work.

The acting wasn't bad by any means but there weren't any knockout performances either. I think everyone gave solid performances and, to be fair, I wasn't able to hear the dialogue very well at my theater so that affects my view of the acting. 

I will say though, the whole 1 week on the Mole and 1 day on the boats and 1 hour with the planes was a bit confusing initially. They kinda just drop that on you at the start and don't really bring it up explicitly at all. It wasn't until Cillian Murphy is rescued from the sunk ship and then shows up in a life boat that helps drag Harry Styles back to shore that the whole timeline started to make some sense. It played out well in the end especially when you see the same events unfold from the perspective of the planes and civilian ships individually, but I love seeing stuff like this, the same thing shown from multiple perspectives. However, that ""transition"" wasn't super clear here either so it took me a minute to get it, and I think I'd enjoy this more on a second viewing. And that last shot cutting from the burning plane to the guy on the train was really weird, I would've preferred it ending on the plane.

Final note, I saw it in IMAX so that probably made the visuals stand out more to me, but did anyone else have an issue with the dialogue? I don't know if it was just the theater I went to or if this is just how it is for every IMAX screening, but I could barely understand what people were saying. And the pilots might as well have been speaking a foreign language for all the difference it would've made. Don't get me wrong, the sound effects for the gun shots, the planes zooming overhead, etc. were great and it really made it feel like you're in the thick of it. But it also made the dialogue really tough to understand. I mean you can still pick up words and phrases which, along with the visual info, is plenty to get the gist of what's going on, but if you want to hear every word then it might be best to avoid the IMAX screenings.

EDIT: Oh and the fact that they had so many real extras on set instead of a bunch of CGI stand ins was also a great decision. It really helped sell the scale of the whole event and it was another aspect that grounded the movie for me and made it feel like you're there experiencing this event.",6ol0kp

dkn5rzy,"For the first 20-or-so minutes I felt it was a bit detached and disjointed, almost documentary-like in its' detachment and lack of dialogue. I quickly warmed to the style though and appreciated the weaving of the different (air/sea/land) perspectives into each other at the climax. I loved the fact that there was no ''soldier nursing his dying buddy in his arms'' scenes but hated the [ scene at the climax where the Commander closes his eyes expecting to die but is saved at the last second]. Aside from this it was almost cliché-free. I also loved the way the movie depicted the most mundane deaths - usually it's the combat roles that grab the most honourable mentions, but in Dunkirk it depicts those trapped below decks meeting their ends as much as anybody. The music was a bit cloying (too much ''something's about to happen'' quickening of the tempo) but otherwise sufficiently moody and dense. I was genuinely on the verge of embarrassing myself with tears a couple of times during Dunkirk, which is an amazing achievement given most films nowadays just do not resonate with me at all, plot and/or characters.

Oh, and I absolutely have to tip my hat to Harry Styles. He could have asked for (and probably demanded) a good guy role. He didn't try to over-reach, he didn't mug. Respect, man.",6ol0kp

When the regular boats arrive, I had a feeling that there are about a dozen of them. Then our protagonists get saved, get on the train, and learn that close to 400.000 people got saved. The entire duration of the movie, we're watching them struggle save 40.000, and they end up saving almost 10x as much. The problem I have is that they really didn't establish the scale of things. I wouldn't expect them to literally show all of them getting saved, but I really thought the number of the boats was way too tiny to justify the grand rescue we learn about at the end. ",6ol0kp
dkrcyq7,"I think this movie was less about the characters and more about the event, if that makes any sense. That's exemplified by the title: Dunkirk. It's about Dunkirk, told through three lenses: those on the shore, the civilian vessels going to save them, and the RAF pilots covering them from above. 

There's no lengthy discussions between the characters about their families or their homes, no scenes where they sit around a fire and trade jokes. There is, however, desperation. There are several bleak scenes of hollow-eyed men staring across the English Channel, sitting in sea foam and praying for deliverance from the Germans. Men reassemble into lines following a dive bomber attack, stepping around their fallen comrades. What Nolan creates is a sense of tunnel-vision: the British soldiers just want to get the hell out of Dunkirk. 

I liked this event-driven story. It paved the way for fantastic visuals and a compelling film. ",6ol0kp
dki87su,"With regards to sound and visuals, it was amazing.

However, I was bit underwhelmed with the plot. There were times where I honestly got a little bored, as much as I tried to be intrigued because I love Nolan. I know it's a story on the evacuation, so the whole movie is supposed to be evacuation, but I guess after a while the repetitive nature of it sorta got to me.

Also, due to the 3 time-lines I never really got attached to any characters either, so they seemed shallow and the stakes didn't seem that high.

The frequent switching between the storylines was hard to follow but at some points it actually had me on the edge of my seat and the connections between the storylines started happening it felt like the movie started accelerating and pushing the pace and just got extremely intense. The audience in my theatre was so small but it felt like everyone was consumed lol. I couldn't fathom the stress of the sole spitfighter who purposefully knew he would run out of fuel if he tried to stop the German bomber from bombing the hundreds of stranded men in the oil ridden water along with the sinking boat, and that if he shot the bomber down anyway it would ignite the oil killing a lot of the men anyway, and he would still die in the end, but yet he does it anyway. That was fucking incredible. And all the men below are just praying that he does this, especially Collins who unknowingly is praying to his former fighter mate. Related to that scene my adrenaline was pumping at an alarmingly high rate when they lead you to believe that the kid who had been through hell and back the whole goddamn movie (the one with the sandy hair who was carrying the man in the stretcher with his friend on the first boat) who was stranded in the oil ridden water when the spitfighter shot the bomber down and ignited the oil, was the soldier frantically trying to hold his breath under water so he wouldn't resurface into the fire above him, and then when he starts drowning he cant help it and resurfaces into the fire and proceeds to scream, burning in agony. So you think holy shit he actually fucking died after everything he went through and he was by far the most atrached you were to any character despite him barely saying anything and you are just thinking its not fair and you are pissed and he died in an extremely horrible death caught in a struggle between burning and drowning and then they pan to him, covered in oil, climbing into the old sailors sail boat with George, the sailors son, and the shellshocked pilot, and he just says exhaustedly ""take me home"" and it just feels like the weight of the world is lifted off your shoulders while simultaneously all the plot lines come to connect full circle in this moment and your emotions are still pouring into the next scene there the heroic spitfighter who you also have become incredibly attached to and who chose his death to save hundreds flies over the horizon of dunkirk with no  fuel and you just think wow this movie is absolute fucking 🔥.",6ol0kp

Dunkirk was incredible. I loved the way they did time. Since the movie covered three different perspectives, each with a climax and conclusion occurring at different points of time within the same overall setting, Nolan creatively bent time to make them flow together perfectly. Perspective was important. You *only* saw things from the character's perspective. There were no cuts to the German antagonists or anything. You experienced what the soldiers experienced and that's what made it so immersive for me. I actually felt that survival instinct. I truly felt some sort desperation that no other movie other than *Das Boot* made me feel.

dkpvsot,"Just saw it for the second time.

First viewing in IMAX, I was really impressed with the spectacle, but felt kind of lukewarm about the lack of character development and the 3 different story perspectives. The sequence of events played out in a slightly confusing way, and a lot of little things didn't click in my mind early on when the focuses would intersect. -- Biggest highlight was getting some serious goosebumps during Tom Hardy's hero shot: his plane idly gliding along the coastline above the cheering soldiers; him landing, setting the plane ablaze, and finally getting captured. That whole sequence was fucking incredible. -- Regardless, I walked out of the theater pleased, but didn't intend to see it again. ""Okay, that was pretty cool. Wasn't really what I was expecting.""

Woke up this morning still thinking about the movie and said fuck it, I'll see it again, this time in 70mm just for fun... Holy shit.

Second time around, knowing exactly what to expect from the movie, my feelings were a lot different. I cared so much more for the characters and what they were going through. Having the context/reveal of some of their actions from the start made their desperation and struggle to survive hit home a lot harder. It didn't matter that I didn't know who they were or what their backstory was, I just felt myself connecting with them much more than I did the first time (on a human level, if that makes sense). -- It was also a lot different knowing the story structure beforehand. Like I and many have said, it took a little while to fully realize what was going on with the timeline on first viewing; everyone seems to have their own ""a ha! moment,"" when the extent of the non-linear storytelling is understood. The intersection of all the characters was much more satisfying and enjoyable the second time.

It's Nolan's M.O., and it's always kind of amazing how he pulls it off, but I think this is really something that needs to be seen twice to experience the film's intended effect. My feelings went from ""enjoyed it"" to ""fucking loved it.""",6ol0kp
dkwb31m,"What an experience. The entire movie felt like a slowly crescendoing nightmare (which was heightened by the soundtrack and cinematography), becoming more surreal and horrific with each passing minute. While I understand why some may have found the lack of dialogue jarring, I personally found it heightened the sense of displacement and detachment that the shell shocked soldiers were experiencing. 

Additionally, I found the use of such youthful looking actors to really drive the point home. It was painful to watch such young people become so cavalier about not only their fellow soldiers deaths, but also their own.

It's definitely not a character study though, and I think that's something a lot of people missed. I'd argue that it's a movie more about the situation itself than any individual characters. What I definitely liked was the pacing in the sense that the tension never really ended until they were on the train in England, which some people didn't really enjoy but I'd argue that in a situation like Dunkirk there isn't ever a real break in the tension, even though it does rise and fall like it did in the movie. Also Nolan didn't feel the need to dive into cliche battle scenes and chose to have an almost invisible enemy, which was refreshing for a war movie. The sense of urgency really made up for the lack of ""action"".

One thing I will agree on is that it did feel sanitized and I think it would've been much better with an R rating in terms of realism. I wouldn't say it was to a degree where it was distracting but it was definitely something that was holding it back.

Overall it felt less like a war movie than I was expecting, and the invisible enemy and constant low-high cycle of tension almost gave it a thriller vibe.

dki90u1,"Dunkirk was a beautiful film. I feel like Nolan did really well in most aspects in the film imo. I think the addition of no ""main character"" really made this film good, because it showed the perspective of every person who helped in the war. The people who came from home, the fighters, and the people evacuating. ",6ol0kp
dkkt4j0,"This seems to be a polarizing movie. If you need characters and development then you won't like this film. A lot of people are saying the lack of dialogue and characters took them out of it but I really disagree. Definitely subjective, but almost everything in the film landed with me and I have never felt as ""in"" the film as I did this time. If you want to see this, see in theaters cause the sound is half the experience",6ol0kp
dkly7b4,"On one end of the spectrum you have 'Pearl Harbor' which treats one of the most traumatic incidents in American history like a pop-corn flick. The people dying is a spectacle. The explosions are a spectacle. The individual characters are elevated to the point where you care very little about the scores of unnamed extras dying the background. Everything explodes all the time including the score. The Michael Bay approach reduces that which should be horrifying into a kind of sick joke.

On the other end of the spectrum there is Dunkirk, which does pretty much the opposite of everything I listed above. I walked away feeling humbled by the awesome sacrifices made by so many. Man... fuck Michael Bay.",6ol0kp

dkswduc,"To all of those complaining about not caring about the characters, not feeling connected to the characters was really the point in my opinion. Most war movies are about the characters in a terrible situation trying to survive or accomplish an objective. Dunkirk was just the story of 400,000 soldiers that wanted nothing more than to go home, and the terror they faced trying to get out of Dunkirk.

In war you don't sit down and tell your life story to the men around you, and this movie shows that. The movie shows how every single soldier feels through the lack of dialogue and lack of emotion. This was obvious to me in the very first scene when our main protagonist was the only survivor after being shot at in the streets, and what does he do? He just moves on and lines up, no tears, no emotion at all. When the beach was bombed, presumably dozens were just killed. What do the soldiers do? They get off the ground and line back up. What else can they do?

This movie does what so many haven't managed to do for me, and that is truly show the helplessness of war. The number of men killed off screen and alone, the men drowned in capsized boats, the wounded that had to be left on the sinking ship, the men crushed as the ship runs into the dock. It is just heart wrenchingly realistic.

One character I did actually really feel connected to was the father of the civilian ship. He was so dedicated to get to Dunkirk and it really made you proud of how mankind banded together to save those men at this battle. He was willing to risk everything just to get there to get a dozen soldiers home. ",6ol0kp
dktjnug,"One of my main criticisms of Nolan is that I rarely actually ""FEEL"" during his movies. Like as far as feeling a sense of triumph or sadness.

But I thought he nailed it in Dinkirk. The part where they see ""home' coming to help through the binoculars was incredible. As was the wrap up scene with Hardy landing and the speech being read. 

The score was absolutely incredible in these two scenes. 

I shed a manly tear. ",6ol0kp
dlg31ib,I loved it. I don't think there was any need to go into depth in terms of characterisation. The event is larger than the characters and so it doesn't waste time developing them. It's a war epic. It's like the Omaha Beach scene in saving private Ryan spread over 2 hours. The soundtrack and visuals go without saying. It portraits the terror of war beautifully. ,6ol0kp

2. This might as well have been a foreign film because I couldn't make out half of what was being said. The gunshots were jumpy and intense but the sound mixing in my showing wasn't great for dialogue. 

3. I need a bottle of xanax. ",6ol0kp
dkw1hv9,"Finished watching it two days ago in IMAX 2D.

**General**

Loved it. One of the better *films* I've seen. It has that relentless feeling I had when watching Mad Max, where it felt balls to the wall nearly every second and before you know it the film has ended. It's a brutal film. Hell, you hear people get crushed against a pier by a ship and you're only a couple feet away from it.

One thing that stood out is the sound. A lot of other people had mentioned it but here's my 2c. It's awesome, as per the definition (extremely impressive or daunting; inspiring awe). The siren sound from the dive-bombing planes fills you with dread. You're like ""Oh no not these fuckers again..."" and *it makes you want to get out of the way*.

Also, the scenes of the capsizing boats, where the water just *rushes upwards* is **TERRIFYING**. If you've ever had ideas like ""If the boat I was on was sinking, I'd just jump out as soon as I could. No fannying around just do it. Every man for himself..."" -- this film will make you see the error of your ways. You *don't have time* to do that. 

**Response to other reviewers**

> *I couldn't get invested in the characters...*

I have difficulty understanding this. I didn't *know* much about the characters, I couldn't tell you their names, for instance. But I knew their faces and what their particular role in Dunkirk is. Their is no ""audience surrogate"" in that there is no single character we follow around. 

We're basically thrusted into the midst of Dunkirk, in the land, sea, and skies. We are with Tom Hardy when he's engaged in dog fighting, when his friend is shot down, [when he runs out of fuel...](#spoiler). Do these reviewers feel nothing even when [Tom Hardy shoots down the last of the dive bombing planes at the end, and the soldiers who witness it on the beach who could have been killed cheer him on. You couldn't empathise with those people then?!?!](#spoiler). I don't believe them for a second.

People are more than welcome to have their own opinions on this film. But at least have your own and don't just parrot what you hear the prominent film reviewers say. It isn't a typical film, it's three separate stories that, at points, coincide. Tom Hardy saves the civilian boaters with his plane. Those boaters save the soldiers escaping Dunkirk. 

> *The sounds are too loud*

For some people I can see that would be an issue. I am a jumpy little guy. When the first gunshot went off I just about shit myself. But at the same time I loved how real it felt. I've been on shooting ranges and heard guns go off. The *CRACK* sound of those guns vibrates in your chest and that sensation felt very well represented in this film.

**Negatives**

1. Fairly minor point. I couldn't understand what Mark Rylance was saying at times.

2. Civilian who dies on the boat with a nail through his head, he starts having a heart-to-heart with his friend. I feel this wasn't executed (to pardon the pun) as well as it could've been. When he was first injured and started whimpering you just *knew* something *bad* had happened. Then you cringe at the injury. But after that point it didn't feel realistic. It would have worked better for me if the boys ""dying monologue"" was instead spliced into normal conversation before he was wounded. 

3. There's a violin sound part way through the film that I felt was out of place and I was very aware of it *not fitting in* with the rest of the sounds. I imagine it's meant to heighten the ""crescendo"" of the music but it detracted from it for me.

**Suggestion**

See this film in IMAX. You want to be as immersed as possible in this film.

It *WILL NOT* feel the same if you watch it from home, unless you have a multi-thousand pound/dollar home cinema set up you *might* get close.

Go and watch it in IMAX, please!

Still a 10/10. I will watch it again in IMAX next week.",6ol0kp
dmai9hi,"Just saw it this weekend and was pretty let down.

dkjqs45,"Saw it yesterday and loved it.  This was an exceptionally lean film that was all about the building up and release of tension.  

It feels to me like the kind of movie Alfred Hitchcock would have made if he had been persuaded by the studios in the late 70s to do a big-budget war epic in the vein of A Bridge Too Far or Tora, Tora, Tora! 

Approaching this as your stereotypical war movie is missing the point - this is a thriller through and through.  

The only thing that pulled me out of the immersion sometimes was the rather obvious fact that the weather didn't always play nice with the production - there are shots that are supposed to be taking place at the same time that alternate clear and overcast skies.  

Other than that I think this movie accomplished what it set out to do in spectacular fashion.

[Oh and I love how well Nolan was able to relay the feeling of British resolve and patriotism without anything like a cheesy shot of a waving flag or anything like that.  Having the exhausted soldier on the train read Churchill's famous quote rather than using a recording or something was brilliant](#spoiler)",6ol0kp
dkk1bhq,"I personally thought the movie was amazing and really appreciated it's originality and how no Nolan film resemables one another. I would give it a 9/10 maybe an 8 dunno. MUST SEE at imax. The beauty of the spitfires flying literally made my jaw drop.

Though for me, I think these small things would of made this film better. (AN OPINION happy to discuss what you think)

1. The soundtrack was great and the soundtrack for intense momments which was the majority was on point. But I didn't think the score for uplifity momments like the boats arriving didn't really fit well I think and I could they could of picked something better

2. When the soliders start cheering i think the music should of been turned down and cheering made louder. I think that would of giving a more immersive and emotive feeling of a beach of around 300,000 people better.

3. More shots of just silence maybe to add to immersion of soliders just waiting and binding their time as they fight for survival. 

4. More god damn beautiful airshots.

This will undoubtedly be buried at this point, but seeing this video brought to mind a conversation I had with someone I had just met on the way to see this film. One of this person's good friends was the son of Robert Rodat, the screenwriter for Saving Private Ryan.

That movie is of course known well for its realistic and graphic first half hour, and has been the subject of tons of TILs, etc. For filmmakers and audiences alike it is a masterclass in war cinema. This fellow told me that after knowing the son for some time, he finally got the chance to have a real conversation with Rodat himself.

Rodat surprised him by admitting he remains incredibly conflicted about writing the film: the same elements that made it the greatest success of his career also made it incredibly difficult for many veterans to watch. Despite all the good it has done him, apparently he regrets writing it because of the sheer amount of trouble it has caused those veterans who have had to relive their experiences at Normandy in such a convincing recreation.",6ol0kp

dkqdt0x,"That scene where Hardy's character is just gliding in the air is honestly cinematic genius in essence. I saw this movie in RPX (I should have seen it in IMAX, but there were no IMAX 70mm showings around my area). I really enjoyed it, but could have preferred some character development in some parts. I understand that the movie is reflective of war in the sense that people don't have the time to talk or banter, but some of it could have been appreciated to really empathise with the characters. With that being said, I think Mark Rylance's and Tom Hardy's characters stood out to me the most. Mark Rylance was just a normal guy doing a duty for his country and Tom Hardy was just a airplane pilot who came in the right time to kick some ass.  8/10, can't wait to see what Nolan does next (Pls do Bond, Pls do Bond).

dkrkd2x,"Loved it. Nolan's most subtle movie, with the most clever non-linear storytelling that only Nolan can orchestrate to make an evacuation movie an A+ experience.

If the film is about the here/now experience of the soldiers that's a ""sh*t"" moment. That's bad news for him!

Remember, the non-officers on the beach think that the war is almost certainly over. Britain will come to terms.

They're talking about people who will probably spit on them because they lost THE WAR not THE BATTLE.

dkvnxe7,"One negative complaint is that at no point did I get a sense of 300,000 people on the beach or getting rescued.

The Navy Admiral guy (Wallander!) seemingly gave us the overall British command view of the operation... and the swelling music (a little overdone IMO) as the small ships came in gave us a ""moment of success"" for the evacuation... but I guess we're just supposed to take those as small wins in a much larger operation? Would have been nice to at some point see the full scale of the operation, if it was bigger than what we saw. Wallander stayed behind, but that was it.",6ol0kp

8.7/10 for me. Best thing about it was not identifying the Germans as the enemy, but rather identifying them as an impersonal unstoppable force. The Nazis as far as cinema goes have been played out IMO and this did a good job of avoiding that. 

I thought the 17 year old kid on the boat plot line was out of place? Other than showing the effects of PTSD on the soldier and some sense of individual purpose in the overall war effort, I thought the character's story was unnecessary. Also, I agree with the other posters of the film failing to show truly the grand scale of 400K individuals being evacuated or trapped. At no point did I feel like there were that many soldiers waiting to be evacuated. If you look at photos of the actual battle, there are more dead soldiers on the beach than truly imaginable...

dmukszp,"[I was just thinking about the last enemy bomber that is shot down by the no-more-fuel Spitfire. I still am not convinced this moment adds significantly to the movie, to be honest. The pilots heroism is already proven at this point by taking out the Heinkel and therefore eliminating his chances of flying back to his base in the UK. Also, I'm guessing this would be close to impossible to achieve on a plane with no more fuel. Would anybody really have missed this moment if it wasn't in the movie? I thought it was edited in a high pace as well, while taking out the other bombers (with fuel) was much more of a time consuming task.

That's what I loved about it. The movie simply gave you that stressful, uneasy feeling of being there at that time. It communicated the different emotions that you might experience like desperation, courage, fear, and emptiness. I loved how it focused more on portraying the event as is and the emotions involved instead of trying to tell some exciting story about some fictional character.",6ol0kp

Perhaps it was because of the lack of dialogue, but I didn't really feel invested in the characters enough to care whether or not they died during the movie. I have prior knowledge of Dunkirk (the actual event, from history classes) and I feel like without this I wouldn't really understand the progression of the movie. I guess it's another one of those highly-acclaimed movies that I'm too dumb to understand. ",6ol0kp
dls0zli,"I have a lot of feelings about this movie, and most of them are bad. First of all Dunkirk isn't a war movie, it's a movie where everything is based around tension. From the very beginning until the boats finally come to rescue the soldiers it goes anywhere from high tension to less high tension. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire movie. And Zimmer's score is almost the entire reason why. The rest of the movie is almost entirely confused in my oppinion as to how to properly manage the tension. For example, early on when it cuts between George moving the life vests onto the boat and Dunkirk being bombed it poorly hobbles them together. The shots with George are played with the same tension filled score as the beach, creating a dissonance. The movie is never willing to create a lull in the tension when it should. Short moments of solace are either played with the strings being quieter but still dissonant, or having the dissonance fade out for percussive tickings. And because of this it never really allows for the most intense moments to shine, they're just as tense as almost any other moment. The most fantastic moments in the movie are those where the tension is resolved. The ships coming in, the soldiers realizing they aren't seen as failures and cowards, yet by failing to properly manage the tension these are the few brief glances into humanity that we get.

That lack of humanity was my other big gripe with the movie. The whole movie is moved along by mechanical failures due to outside forces. Ships being torpedoed, a planes fuel meter breaking due to being shot, the trawler being speckled with bullet holes, etc. But it seems to use these and the failings of the human body and mind almost interchangeably. I've seen in this thread people question why George lost his sight before he died and I see this as the reason, humans are placed as machines that may be broken. This is compounded by the lack of dialogue, a decision that I usually love. When we hear nothing from these characters they don't take form, we see them struggle but we never come to an understanding as to why they struggle how they do. What is so sad to me is that it is absolutely possible to pull that off. But Nolan seemed content to allow performances that never really give shape to the mostly voiceless characters. We never see any of the soldiers at Dunkirk experience dread, or hope, or any other emotion other than just surviving even at times when they do get to rest their heads even if briefly. 

All in all it seemed more interested in creating a 1 dimensional experience for far too long than is appropriate. While it did at times deliver good tension and fantastic resolutions to those tensions, it never went beyond that to become a movie that was better than good.",6ol0kp
dkjgyc2,"I went in expecting a lot from this film and I think it's half my fault I find it as lacklustre as I  do.

There's lots of things that ruined my immersion in this film. The buildings in the background on the beach and when Hardy is flying over are clearly not 1940s, the beach is almost entirely empty despite there being 400,000 people there. There were only three regiments on the beach in the film and about 30 Frenchmen in total. Dunkirk was under constant air attack yet we see less than four planes attack the beach.

Making the Germans an unseen enemy certainly added to things but their effect is wasted when we see very little impact from their attacks. When they break through on the sand dunes they pepper a boat with holes and hit one man, then we never hear of this breakthrough again, even as the little ships sail in to rescue people.

The fleet of little ships has around 20 ships at maximum in it. The weather seemed to change from perspective to perspective even when it was supposed to be concurrent. The sea would be bright blue for Hardy then grey and choppy for Rylance.

A lot of the film just feels very empty. I was expecting something much more grandiose. While Nolan does an exceptional job creating smaller personal stories I felt seeing the same scene three times from different perspectives very tiring. Also, of the main cast, only two people die at Dunkirk. The Frenchman and the boy who fell down some stairs. There's very little impact when a load of tertiary characters or extras are killed off.

It's an incredibly artsy film and there are some beautiful set pieces in it but war isn't beautiful. It's dirty, bloody and horrible. There were moments in this film I thought were great, and the overall tension was palpable and very well done but I left feeling very ""meh"" about it.

  I know the movie gets criticized on it not having any main characters or exposition, and certainly that stood out, but I don't think that's a slight against the movie.  Even then, when certain characters were killed I still had an emotional response.  

  The cinematography was gorgeous.  The music was fitting and tense.  The sound?  Woo the sound was something on its own.  Hearing the jericho trumpets as the Stukas came in gave me goosebumps and an adrenaline rush.  The farting noise of the .303's on Tom Hardy's Spitfire as we see flashes impacting on a Bf-109 was fantastic.  

  I'm also happy, even if they weren't covered much in the film, that the French were represented and shown to be the stalwart defenders as they bought time for the British to escape.

dkkfual,"What strikes me about this movie is how different it is from a lot of Christopher Nolan's other movies, but is just as good if not better. The Dark Knight Trilogy were great action films, but could tend to be dialogue-heavy and invested in its characters a lot. *Dunkirk* was comfortable without dialogue, and had some slimmer character development that other of his films. 

The interweaving storylines and timelines of *Dunkirk* could make it narratively disorienting at times, but they were all so stylistically united that it didn't feel clunky. Great editing allowed the three storylines to build on the suspense of one another.

My only complaint is the fairly optimistic ending. Nolan hasn't been afraid to use ambiguous endings, and despite Tom Hardy's character being captured, the scenes of the soldiers arriving home broke the dreary color-palate and seemed romantically optimistic, particularly with the whole Churchill speech too. It struck me as incongruous from the rest of the movie.",6ol0kp

dky20dn,"(Spoilers included) I thought this was a wonderful film. For the budget it was surprisingly minimal, the soundtrack wasn't overly emphatic and the dialogue was few and far between. For me, these things didn't detract from the experience at all. And I use this word because this is exactly what this film is, an *experience*. This is not a character driven narrative. It's the narrative of many characters, many that we don't know, won't ever know. It doesn't seek to make these people relatable to the viewers, because truth be told, most people can't relate to being in war.

To the people saying there isn't character development, there is. It's just not as spoon fed as a lot of Hollywood films are. This is all intentional by Nolan.

As many people have said, where this film excels is the sound. The roaring of the planes was exhilarating and terrifying and it (excuse the pun) propelled the tension throughout. The explosions, the gunfire, none of it was glamorised. It was ugly and yet beautiful.

In terms of flaws, I might say the scale of the fight wasn't as large as it should have been. Another thing might be how the scenes would cut right before the action was about to be amplified - this editing technique was nice a few times, but it soon became predictable and repetitive to me. These, however, are minor things. Overall, you will not be wasting your money seeing this.

It's not as good as Memento, but it's a Solid 8.

as for the people being disappointed that they didn't go into the characters' backstories.... i actually really preferred that. it felt like the movie was about the event, and not the people. they were all just pawns in what could have been a horrific moment in history. too many films take too long to establish characters but we jump right into the action.

one of my favorites of the year so far",6ol0kp

dl4sbzx,"Overall I would say it was a 7/10. I enjoyed it, but it clearly was not the masterpiece so many critics made it out to be.

I think the biggest problem was that most of it was so sterile. I wasn't as engaged as I could have been because I didn't care all that much about most of the characters and because quite frankly, there was pretty much no gore or violent death scenes. The only storyline that worked as inteneded was the old man because his storyline was the only one that actually featured real characters. In order for that sterile style to still work, the scale would have had to be way larger. If you can't manage the scale, you have to make us care about the people you do depict. Also, they never properly established a proper ticking clock to explain why they were so eager to get out.",6ol0kp

dktpwso,"Watched this today at the old Muvico in West Palm Beach (now an AMC some number or other.) Supposedly 70mm, but shown in widescreen so presumably not as Nolan wanted it.

My view: Holy fuck. This is right up there with Schindler's List as a film that everyone should be required to see. I've never seen anything come close in terms of presenting the terror of war in a way that hammers it home. The Deerhunter was clearly about something else. FMJ was, well, the first half was outstanding, the second middling. Apocalypse Now and Platoon just fail.

Nolan tells the story by weaving together three powerful dramas, and by god we need two of those dramas, because the third, what's happening at Dunkirk itself, is mindboggling hopeless and terrifying. Early scenes at Dunkirk set the tone, with unprotected soldiers facing German attacks. The first scene involving (is this a spoiler? It's a historical movie) a (edit) Junkers dive bomber left me shaking in my seat. The trailer already gives some of that away, but without the sound and without the consequences.

I thought every part of it was well done. The actor who played Mr Dawson, the owner of the boat the film focuses on, in particular did a performance that felt incredibly real.

I'm blown away by it. Really I am.

dktj862,"One thing that I've notice isa a pinch of lovecraftian horror in the plot.

In HP's lovecraft novels and tales, the danger is faceless: you can never see your threat directly, but you can feel its presence. And this makes the situation even more horrifying, because you can't know for sure what it will do next!

In dunkirk, [SPOILER!!!]with the exception of Hardy's surrender scene [SPOILER!!!], you dont see any german soldier, only their guns, bombs, and planes, thus, their actios were unpredictable. ",6ol0kp
dkwlz83,"I thought it was great!

- I was happy to see age appropriate casting - the soldiers actually looked like the kids they were. 
- War movies usually focus on the heroism and horror of war. *Dunkirk* is 100 minutes of fear.
- The well-crafted sound design and editing really helped convey that anxiety with it's many quiet moments, as well as the pounding score
- It's a very austere, clean looking film, which can be an agreeable or disagreeable quality, depending on how you think a war film should look and feel.
- Even when it all goes to hell, The Brits can't stop their natural urge to queue. But in all seriousness, that's some great training right there.

dklbkcm,"I actually just got back from the theater a few minutes ago where I went and saw this. Frankly, I LOVED it. It was intense, gut-wrenching, and (from what I believe) a very accurate portrayal of what truly happened back in 1940. There was not one moment in the entire film where I could sit back and take a breather; I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. 

I think the three different timelines occurring simultaneously within the film was the best aspect. The depictions of what happens on land, in the sea, and in the air during the war really drove the point home about the horrors of war and the fear these soldiers felt. Also, for two people making their acting debut, Fionn Whitehead and Harry Styles both did an amazing job! I had previously known of Styles from his music and was very pleasantly surprised at how well he did! I had never heard of Fionn Whitehead before watching this film, but he delivered an incredible performance as well.

Overall, I give this film a 10/10 and would definitely recommend it! The only thing I would say is that it's not for the faint of heart as it is very intense and doesn't slow down; essentially the essence of a great war movie.

I was able to sit back and enjoy the score better and focus on the smaller details of the film. I was able to appreciate the intertwined timelines more and the finale had a bigger impact too. 
Some of the aerial shots were breathtaking. There even was minor applause during my second viewing once the credits showed up. 
A solid 9 for me. I can see this being a timeless classic. Although I can see why opinions may differ, I don't get how some can find this 'boring'. There's so much going on throughout and the multiple timelines demand that you to be invested and think on it. ",6ol0kp

Now, is it his most entertaining? I still don't really know. But from a narrative and technical standpoint, this is definitely his best film.

This ""complex narrative structure"" that people thought would be divisive or too hard to follow was surpringsly simple. Yes, it is kind of like the different layers of Inception, but it is pretty damn tame in comparison. I was never lost in what was going on, but maybe it's because I knew about the structure beforehand. I was actually maybe looking for it to be a little more ""complex"" then it actually was, since I love the idea of interweving stories and timelines. 
And, as always, Nolan and Zimmer know how to end their movies. The ending was great.
I still don't know if it's my favorite film of his, but it is HIS best film. Thought it was great overall. Just don't go in expecting a war movie, as he said so himself.

The most powerful part of this movie, to me, was when Cillian's character asks the older brother if George is okay, and the brother responds that he is, despite being fucking pissed at him. He now understood the frailty of this washed-up soldier, and didn't want to add to his anguish. ",6ol0kp
dkjfxea,"Technically, this movie is incredible.  The practical effects and camerawork is awe-inspiring and adds a ton of realism to the proceedings.  I was on the edge of my seat for many moments.

Story, structure, and acting wise, it wasn't anything special.  I didn't care about anyone, also couldn't tell certain characters apart (""Oh that guy died- oh, wait never mind, he's still there!""), and the timelines sometimes didn't mesh necessarily to my liking.

Also, the sound mixing at the IMAX Theater was AWFUL.  Couldn't hear any of the little dialogue this film had.  In retrospect, I wish it was a complete silent film.

All that being said, I can't get the movie out of my head.  It's a pure visual/audio experience.  It's not perfect, but it's beautiful and harrowing at the same time.  It's a film's third act for two hours.  It pulsates.

The silent spitfire descending and descending and you just thinking Tom hardy's character would die. To all the men seeing him, cheering him. To his capture by the germans.

I think it's partly because the style of this film is very different to most other Nolan films, and for that matter other films in general. The focus isn't on a character driven narrative. There isn't really any story to follow. Rather the goal was to show the viewer the horror of Dunkirk, how desperate the soldiers/officers/airmen were, and how close Dunkirk came to be a far worst disaster than it was.

Not a fanboy or anything, just saying that when a film subtly or unsubtly establishes its own rule set (in this case, one week, one day, one hour,) and it proceeds to follow suit to the best of its capacity, the framework by which criticism is formulated shouldn't account for your failure to understand it.

Many men surviving u boat hits and against all odds, even after ending up on the shore again, surviving and being picked up.

It seems impossible to be able to invoke on screen the evacuation of Dunkirk in a grand scale because of how sheerly massive it was.

The pilot scenes were the best I've seen. Those shots of Tom Hardy's plane at the end flying with the sun in the background. So god damn beautiful. The whole film was.

Harry Styles was good in this. The scene where he's accusing the French soldier of being a german spy. He did a great job of selling his fear and desperation.

The acting was on point for the needs of the film, as was the soundtrack which suited the growing tension of the film. 

The sound design was excellent, the sound of the firing of Browning 303's in the Spitfires and other sounds and **the shrieks of the Ju-87 Stukas**... I have never watched a movie that made the Stuka sound as terrifying as this. Was in awe at the screech and how others reacted to them. They did the Sirens justice in this film.

It is too bad that they could not get an actual BF-109E instead of the Spanish versions but I can overlook that. The fighter combat and details of operation in combat and flight management were authentic to me. Was great.

As a history nerd, I approve of this film. Encapsulated Dunkirk very well.

The dogfights were suspenseful as hell and the scenes with the soldiers desperatly trying to survive was intense.

The sound especially made you feel like you were there, the percussion from the bullets being fired could be felt right in your chest.   

**One of the most memorable aspects of the film to me was this:**

I found myself shrinking in my seat at the crescendo of the siren from the Stuka dive bombers, probably the most terror-inducing aspect from the film. The Stukas produced the same effect on me as the shark in Jaws. You saw these planes approach the soldiers on the beach by slicing through the sky with the same ominous and predatory focus of the Great White going after the Orca. Towards the end of the film when you see that final Stuka approaching with that siren cranking up again you are just like ""OH FUCK NO!!!"" It's really just breathtaking the anxiety level Nolan is able to crank up with both the sound of the film and the way it's shot. Before we ever see the Stukas for instance, we see the soldiers terrified reactions to spotting them. It's extremely effective and I wish more filmmakers would explore these simpler ways to exploit the audience's sense of fear and dread more.",6ol0kp
dkl54ml,"Back from the Theater.

Loved it. Was tense through out for the majority of the film.

Think it portrayed the awfulness of the situation, adding in with little touches here and there, just making the picture feel more complete.

Think the Characters were fine. I probably didn't learn the name of quite a few, but don't think i was meant to. Their stories could have been one of any others soldiers stranded on that beach. In the end i still got the idea i knew those soldiers, those characters. Some of their characteristics, fears and ultimately their desperation to escape certain defeat.

My criticism to the movie, could be biased due the intermission, but felt after the intermission there were too many Cuts, would have liked some more continuity.

Minor Spoiler: [In insight would have liked that one of the characters we follow more closely would have died (besides the french). I was a bit confused to figure out if it was him who had died on the sinking boat or not.](#spoiler)

Two things stood out for me: First, the jericho sirens every time the stukas arrived were awesome and scary and made me feel like I was actually there.

dklekeg,"Two words I would use to describe this movie would be relentless and stressful. The constant ticking/heartbeat throughout really conveyed the pressure from an unseen enemy. The sound design was incredible, which is something Nolan has always been good at, but it really made this movie. The scenes with the dive bombers were so loud and honestly terrifying. Every gunshot made me jump.

One thing that bothered me a bit was how everything kept coming down to the wire in every scenario, but then at the last minute something happens and the characters we follow escape. It felt a little too ""hollywood"" to me, which is a shame because if it weren't for that, I'd have no problem putting it up there as one of the best war movies of all time. It did a good job of avoiding most of the other war movie tropes like making the soldiers morally untouchable or glorifying the violence or having a sappy patriotic score, so it was a little disappointing to see it fall into the predictable pitfall where the main characters never actually feel like they're in danger despite the situation.

Overall though, I would say this is the best movie I've seen all year and definitely one of the better war movies to come out in recent years. I'd consider it to be Nolan's best work as well. His movies always had a grand scale, but with the complicated premises, it was always brought down by awkward exposition and clunky dialogue. There's none of that in Dunkirk and we're left with what Nolan does best; amazing sound and visual design.",6ol0kp
dklgnnj,"Just saw it awesome movie!!!! The story structure was weird but I kept up with it, I am still analyzing it in my head now. Loved all of the actors even if I couldnt tell most of the soldiers apart most of the time, but the bigger actors i knew who they were. Also on a side note some people in my theater were being rude and the guy next to me kept his nose in his shirt as if he smelled a bad odor. ",6ol0kp

dkljh51,"My dad and I were incredulous with Hardy's stalled Spitfire shooting down a diving stuka along with the Spit's 10,000:1 glide ratio at the end.  I get it, it's an artistic send off, but for a film that is based on realism it went into One-Punch Man territory at the end. ",6ol0kp
dkmf08s,"I think this is probably the best film I never want to see again. I feel like I've just gone through hell and back watching this. The immersion was truly incredible. The conclusion snuck up on me, I could swear that wasn't two hours.

I thought people were overexaggerating when they said this film was loud... No this film is FUCKING LOUD. Even on my local cinema's fairly modest speaker system, the sounds absolutely boomed out. As I say, the immersion was truly something to behold. I've always been of the idea that you can watch a film in anyway you want- if you want to watch it on your phone, watch it on your phone. If you have yet to see Dunkirk yet, absolutely do see it at the cinema, I can't imagine it will have the same effect on home video for most.

There have been many-a horror film that aren't as scary as this, the tension is absolutely palpable. You know how it's going to end but it doesn't matter, you're still absolutely terrified for all these individuals, just waiting for another German plane or some sort of bombardment to come in.

Sounds strange to say but you probably could have cast unknowns in most of this roles and the effect would have likely have been the same. Brannagh and Sir Mark Rylance absolutely work as the authority figures, and of course it's wonderful to see James D'Arcy get a major role in a major film but I almost feel like Cillian Murphy was wasted here. He does a wonderful job as a shellshocked soldier but when you see him in the cast, you go in perhaps expecting a bigger role. Not a criticism, just an observation.

My only criticism is the sound mixing. I'd heard people say that the music and sound effects are a bit too loud at times and I agree. I could hardly hear what the characters were saying half the time. Mark Rylance especially, ironically enough who was away from the action for 2/3rds of the film. Hans Zimmer deserves as much credit as Nolan because without his soundtrack, the film wouldn't be half as good, it creates the tension unto itself. I appreciate what they were going for with the overbearing sound and it does work in absolutely knocking you for six, but at a cost of the dialogue.

Dunkirk is a spectacle, truly, I can't remember a film in recent memory that has immersed me into it's world so deeply, I felt like a soldier on the beaches, just dying for a way out. Zimmer's soundtrack might be his best yet and whilst it's jarringly loud at times, getting in the way of the dialogue, it more than does its job. The lack of characterisation is somehow turned into a positive for the movie as it lends itself to remind you that it's a team effort, it's about 400,000 people surviving, and getting them out of occupied-France and back to safety. The film expresses that perfectly, and is exactly what a film about the British evacuation should be about.",6ol0kp

In the end I felt like I had my expectations in another place going in.

Mark Rylance puts in the best supporting performance of the year so far (again). The Winston Churchill speech at the end is a bit cliche, but it definitely hit the spot. Branagh, Hardy, Lowden, Murphy, Styles, and Whitehead all put in solid performances. It looked & sounded amazing (my screen did not do it justice, which is one of the reasons I'm going to a different theater tomorrow).

dkivcjj,"Seeing a lot of complaints about the lack of character development, and I think people are having a hard time understanding how that's not the point of this movie. 

It's a different kind of war movie, it's about survival. Most of the characters we meet are having the same experience as the people around them. There are thousands of soldiers stranded on this beach, and there are hundred of civilian boats trying to help. Nolan focuses on the cast we see, but we don't dive to deeply into who they are because they're not unique, they're interchangeable with the person next to them when it comes to their driving goal of survival.",6ol0kp
dkkdbwy,"Overall I liked Dunkirk, but my big complaint was the sound. Maybe it was the theater I saw it in, but it was just TOO DAMN LOUD. I get that he was trying to make the movie more ""visceral"" with the sound, but it literally hurt watching this movie a lot of the time. I looked over at my half-deaf senior citizen father and he had his hands over his ears like a 10-year old autistic child much of the time. It was hard to understand what little dialog there was between the spitfire engines, gunshots and explosions. 

My second complaint was the music. I like a lot of Hans Zimmer's music but I feel he can be really overbearing sometimes in Nolan's films and here that was definitely the case. Zimmer's music was like a mosquito buzzing in your ear throughout the film and I found it to be an unpleasant experience. ",6ol0kp

Contrary to the criticisms I'm seeing a lot here, I got really emotionally invested in the story and the well-being of the characters. People didn't exposit their emotions, because they don't in real life. I guess that's just what made parts of it so damn good: it felt real.

And despite the lack of dialogue, there were some really standout performances. Hardy, Murphy, Rylance; the cast did a great great job.

And I LOVED the triptych structure. I really enjoyed piecing together exactly what they were doing, moments like Cillian Murphy on the boat giving orders were made so interesting, and when it all finally locks together at the end: so damn satisfying!

Oh and the score. Can't forget about the score. Zimmer has done it again. tick tick tick tick tick.......",6ol0kp
dklng51,"Loved the movie, but I think it suffered from Nolan's lack of CGI. In real life, there were hundreds of thousands of men on the beach, hundreds of planes in the air, etc. At most we had a few hundred men on the beach in the film, and 3 spitfires? (they used ACTUAL spitfires, which probably accounts for why they only have 3)

Can you imagine the ending scene of tom hardy gliding to safety with thousands of people on the beach cheering for him?

There's a sense of scale that's completely missing from the film. Also, it has a little bit of batman's PG13 cleanliness that's kind of hard to ignore sometimes.

All that said, I still absolutely loved the film. ",6ol0kp
dkigzjd,"I'm torn on Nolan after Interstellar and after seeing Dunkirk I feel I need to see it again to really make any definitive decision. 

I feel this is Nolan at his most ""Nolan"" - similar to Tarantino and Hateful Eight. The ticking clock from the get go set the pace and my heart was pounding for the majority of the film. The cinematography was astounding and experiencing the first person view in the fighters was spectacular. 

Even though the acting in some parts on behalf of Fionn Whitehead was jarring and felt more like a male model than an actor, Hardy and Rylance lifted it for me. When we were watching one character I always wanted to know what the others were up to.

One thing I will comment on is Nolan's obsession with water. Especially in regards to his characters drowning.

In The Prestige [a lot of what surrounds the plot is the water tank Angier uses in his trick. His ex wife drowns on stage in a gushing spectacle gone wrong.](#spoiler) Bruce Wayne's bat-lair is covered by a raging water fall and is within the aqua ducts of the old Wayne manor. Bane sets up camp in the watery sewers of Gotham in DkR. 

Water and characters relationship with water is a huge thing in Inception. [Cobb's kick begins by being dunked in a bath tub of water and in the dream he drowns when the walls explode with water, not to mention the continuous imagery of crashing waves and sounds of waves as well as the end kick of crashing into a river off a bridge in the van](#spoiler). 

Then with Dunkirk [characters are continuously placed in deadly situations involving drowning. Tommy and Damian Bonnard's character of the French Soldier are always nearly drowning. This is again an element of stress exemplified by Collins the pilot and his escape from the filling plane](#spoiler) obviously this motif fits perfectly in the historic setting of the film.

My explanation to this drowning/water element that Nolan puts in so many of his films is rooted in, what I believe, Nolan's obsession with dreaming and dreamscapes. The feeling of drowning in a dream or the feeling of escaping/running from impending doom is something as an audience we can all relate to. I felt Dunkirk adopted a feeling of a bad dream/nightmare. A notion Nolan is fascinated with.

Did anyone else feel the same?

TL'DR Dunkirk good. Nolan likes water.",6ol0kp

I think the film needed more of that. Also, the planes would've been a lot scarier if we'd have actually felt their impact. All of the casualties were faceless soldiers. We weren't really given a reason to care beyond them sounding terrifying.

I think Dunkirk was different from any other war movie that's been shown to date - and that can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on what you prefer. 
When people think of a war movie they expect a great epic heroic story, one where we follow a character or two from beginning and end and laugh and cry with them. Dunkirk instead made me feel like I was right in the front seat of that one battle. There wasn't a huge developing plot line, there wasn't a chance for us to get emotionally attached to any of the characters, but that's what made it so unique.
No other war movie has given me a 2 hour long panic attack like this one has.

The experience was better than expected, but the movie was a let down personally just due to how much love I have for Inception, Interstellar, The Dark Knight, The Prestige, and Memento (in that controversial order).

The one thing I loved about this movie that made it stand out from other war movies was the point of view. Most war movies have the protagonists as these hardened warriors killing every enemy in sight. Even if the heroes die in the end, they kicked ass doing it. This was the first time where I truly understood what it must have felt like when you're on the losing side. Being surrounded and slowly losing your perimeter; its got to be terrifying.

I liked that there wasn't much character development. Nolan did want it to focus on the war and not on the character themselves. By doing that, for me, I could feel the soldiers loss of defeat and hope during the film. It made me focus on what they were feel at that moment in time, regardless of their backstory.

I did find the score to be a bit much. I love Hans Zimmer but I felt that in some scenes it was redundant for the score or that it dragged on a bit too long, if that makes any sense.

Still, despite some great moments of awe, suspense and horror, I still feel that a majority of the time spent watching this had me somewhat bored and disengaged. To me I think this came down to the pacing, which until the end never gave you a moments rest to absorb what was happening on screen, leaving you more and more emotionally blunt to a lot of the action depicted on screen as time passed by. I realize that the point of editing the film in such a breathless manner was precisely the opposite; to make people feel the stress and anxiety of the event.

Likewise for the scenes on the boats/ships. It's not a classic war movie like Saving Private Ryan or similar, but I wouldn't have expected that from Nolan anyway. 

It stayed somewhat close to the true history of the evacuation from Dunkirk, although the scale of the evacuation was somewhat understated. 

I know that some Nolan fans will be torn by Dunkirk, my favorite Nolan movie would be Inception at this point, but Dunkirk is up there. I left the cinema with a feeling of having witnessed something epic.

Question: Does anyone by chance know the make and model of the wristwatch Farrier (Hardy) was wearing?

I think I'll definitely be picking this one up on Blu-Ray when the time comes.

dkwr4ke,"I was told that the violence, for a war movie, was tame. Someone even called it a ""poetic"" depiction. So, I went. 
OK, maybe in that there was little blood, that could be true, but it was violent and disturbing, nonetheless. 
I made the best of it. I did love the soundtrack (not even knowing it was Zimmer until the ending credits), and the cinematography was excellent.
My major criticism is that I could not understand most of the dialog. Fortunately, one can get through it without hearing every word spoken... (don't tell me:  Nolan did that on purpose bc he didn't want us getting familiar with any 1 character?) I was wishing it was closed caption.",6ol0kp
dl69y54,"Amazing movie. The gritty tension and swapping storylines really captured the atmosphere of the individual characters and their struggles, the sailor being the calmest as he does not know what to expect at dunkirk, the soldier being the most tense as every second on that beach is a fight for survival, and the air forces being the most isolated as he is cooped up in a small compartment alone for the duration of the film. While not having a traditional plot, much like Fury Road this film survives with its visuals and score alone, just showing the true carnage of war not unlike Saving Private Ryan but in an entirely different direction. I could go on for days about Christopher Nolan himself, but all I'll say is I'm pleasantly surprised with the way he made this, unlike the more mind-bending projects in the past, this film is very much more human.

I also thought the characters were thin and it was hard to feel sort of emotionally connected to them. It was a visual spectacle and the intensity throughout the film was well done.  Definitely  a huge technical accomplishment",6ol0kp
dkk1p52,"The ending for many (but not all) characters was somewhat unexpected. A lot of unlikable characters never got their comeuppance. Cillian Murphy's character is a coward who so desperately doesn't want to go back to Dunkirk that he accidentally kills George. Yet he is saved in the end. The jerk in the grounded boat who accuses the other guy of being a spy makes it home, while the other one drowns.

Meanwhile, many of the brave characters do not necessarily get the karma they deserve either. George tries to be brave by joining the rescue boat, but dies in an accident. Tom Hardy is captured after a successful dog fight. Even the other pilot who nearly drowned is rudely asked ""where the hell were you?"" by a fellow soldier at the end. 

So I see varying levels of ""success"" for the characters in this movie. Which I think is rather appropriate since the subject is a chaotic war and happy endings are not guaranteed. ",6ol0kp
dldfr80,"Watched it yesterday. Didn't read up on it, didn't watch a trailer. All in all: meh.

Great sound, music and cinematography, lacking nearly anything else. There was barely any dialogue, no characters. I felt the scale was too small. There were only ever 1,2 or 3 German planes, that posed only a little danger, there was no feeling that there is a war around the beach. Also, the town around the beach was in pristine condition. That felt completely out of place. 

There were strange anime like dogfighting scenes, where the English pilots stopped fighting for a minute and the German pilots just waited for the English pilot to finish his conversation or watch his wingman land in the water.

To tell the 3 parts in 3 different speeds was just meh again. I dont't even know what to make of it. I think if one had focused on the men on the beach in the first part of the movie, the desperation of these men could have been felt much more intensely. But then again, non-linear storytelling is his thing (you could also say gimmick) so there's that.

I felt the movie was told in a strange way. It wasn't a telling of a story, but rather a show of emotions. I was also thinking about the german word ""stichpunktartig"", I can't think of a good english translation. I felt it was like this:
- soldier, beach, running, other soldiers
- plane, other plane, shoot, smoke, pilot, emotion

6/10 for me, would watch it again if nothing else is on.

dkjwqp3,"I think Kermode said it best.

If you can make blockbuster cinema like this.

Why would you not.

It's beautiful. It's haunting. It's sparse. The delivery of the story is intricate yet incredibly well conceived.

I mean fuck, you made an American cry for the Brits taking an L.

That's a real rarity. 

The closing shot of Tom Hardy burning the plane was utterly incredible.

Another interesting thing was how Nolan *earned* that last shot. It's a reverse of *The Beguiled*. I felt that films closing moments were so utterly terrific, mainly due to the lack of non-diagetic sound throughout the piece. Then, in the closing moments, we are given such a beautiful diagetic synth. The whole scene quite moved me, in a way that if the film had a true score, I don't think would've been possible.

The opposite is true here. When you reach that singular moment  pure of silence, something you haven't heard since that very first moments of the film, it blew me away. I was honestly in belief our projectionist had fucked up.

I have a few flaws with the handling of the Frenchie and Killian Murphies character, but they're so miniscule it frankly does not matter

Visually I think it is one of the best films ever made. You're just there. 

One of the things I liked a lot about the plot is it balanced moments of heroism with large amounts of the sheer terrified clusterfuckery that was war in general and dunkirk in particular.

Was anyone else confused about [the main character being a German mole?

As soon as he got to the beach ""The Mole"" titlecard came up. I spent the entire movie thinking they were both Germans who were just trying to sneak away from Dunkirk on the British ships.

dklh600,"This is genuinely the first movie I've ever seen that has left me completely speechless. Saw it in IMAX with my best friend, it's our tradition to see films once a week after payday together and then bullshit for hours about the movie we just saw, we both sat in my car and didn't say a word for 20 minutes. We muttered ""it was amazing"" and then silence. We both couldn't escape our thoughts of the battered beaches of Nolan's Dunkirk. Silence. Deafening silence. Both in my car and on the screen. Nolan wove such an amazing story of defeat and triumph. I'm just having an impossible time processing it all.

dkk4dcq,"Watched it on 70mm. A true cinematic experience after a long time (Gravity).

Nolan cuts right to the chase, doesn't dwell on character development and sees the larger picture of the story of survival and hope.

The different timelines keeps the audience on the edge of the seat and my mouth was dry after such an exhilarating experience.

Nolan's best after Inception, Memento.

9/10.",6ol0kp
dkl2tvi,"As far as the lack of dialogue and character development criticisms go. This doesn't bother me, it's a different kind of war film and I love it for that reason, I like new spins on old genres. I think the key to appreciating this more is that Dunkirk is in many ways a ""disaster film"". 

If you listen to or read about accounts of people who survived disasters there is often very little dialogue going on and very little time to explicitly introduce yourself to people you meet. I've listened to quite a lot of 9/11 survivor stories and many of them are purely action-based; running down crowded stairwells, avoiding falling debris, finding ways around fires, sprinting through the streets to escape the radius of the collapse. There's no time for in-depth conversations that qualify as traditional character development. 

With that said I felt that given the limited time spent on our main characters, they did a good job giving them distinct  personalities. Tommy was very much the naive and innocent every-man character, Alex was a bit more world-weary, cynical, and willing to push people overboard (literally) to save his own skin. And Tom Hardy's character Farrier also had a subtle arc. He's basically out of fuel and you can tell just from his eyes and looks that he's in the midst of a moral dilemma: ""Do I turn back home, find a safe place to eject/land or do I risk it all to take down that bomber that's about to hit my fellow soldiers?"" This scene alone says so much about the kind of person his character is. 

After Farrier makes up his mind he does his victory lap and emergency landing, resigned to his fate as an imminent prisoner of war. I found Farrier's character arc to be pretty awesome actually, especially with that last shot of him getting captured with that look on his face that just said ""Yeah you know I just fucked a bunch of your guys up, go ahead and take me in.""",6ol0kp
dkl4jnj,Hans Zimmer's score is the main protagonist of the film.,6ol0kp
dklbnxg,"Honestly my favorite part of this movie was the incredible score by Hans Zimmer. I loved how the soundtrack echoed a ticking a clock which really elevated the desperation of the soldiers stranded on the beach, desperate to the escape as their lines of defense collapsed.

I will admit the dialogue was a bit hard to hear at times, but it wasn't that big of a deal because you could have honestly muted the whole movie and still understood what was going on. The visuals were really all you needed to tell the story.

I don't think it's the greatest war movie ever, but I will say that it is one of the more immersive simply due to the impressive visual design and soundtrack which really suck you into the mood of the scene.",6ol0kp
dkllrhl,"I enjoyed the film, but it fell victim to what I usually have an issue with when it comes to Nolan: it was far too clinical. I just never fully connected with anything that was happening, because there weren't any really strong characters. Now, I'd say that it did not need super strong characters for the story it was trying to tell. This was not about any single one of them. But the issue then becomes that I don't feel the emotional gut punch that comes when the teenager dies, or when Tom Hardy is captured. It was far too removed for me to be invested in the individuals.

I also have to say that god damn is this a loud film. Like, it hurts the ears at some points. I can see the argument that this is made to put the audience right in the action, but I still think it was rather unpleasant.

Despite all these, the film is still very good. It's beautifully shot, well paced, well acted, and does the story justice. 8/10.",6ol0kp
dktwvov,"Here's my interpretation of the three ""levels"" and ""timelines"" of the film: Tom Hardy's is the most straightforwardly ""valorous"" and ""heroic."" But it also the shortest time frame. His encounters are certainly frightening and filled with danger, but they are necessarily short encounters, somewhat at a distance from experiencing mass suffering. Valor and heroism are associated with that compressed temporal engagement. By contrast, the ""long"" time frame of the soldiers doesn't allow for easy narratives of bravery, valor, and honor. The suffering is too prolonged, grotesque, up close, and stressful. We don't judge Cillian Murphy's character, or any of the characters (the main character in the 7-day perspective is a guy who tried to ""cheat"" his way to the top of the exit queue). The ""boat"" perspective is somewhere in between, given that it's perspective is a day (versus one hour or 7 days). 

Interestingly, Nolan already made a similar kind of connection between time and heroism in The Dark Knight with the quote: ""You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain."" ",6ol0kp
dki9cnr,"Pretty spectacular - especially the dogfighting sequences. Despite being very light on actual ""story"", it's pretty emotionally resonant, especially towards the end, and the nonlinear format comes together really nicely.

- The cinematography was unbelievable. A couple of the sweeping beach shots were breathtaking, especially in 70mm.

- As many have stated, it's definitely different from a standard war movie. More geared towards survival then actual strategy and fighting.

- While character development isn't the point of the movie (To the point that I could really only tell you one or two character names) I thought it was a little hard to get myself to **really** root for anyone to survive as there's not a strong emotional connection to any one in particular. It also didn't help that everyone on the beach looked generally the same which, while historically accurate, made it hard to differentiate between characters.

- I didn't find the multiple timelines to be all that distracting and thought it fit into a cohesive narrative at the end.

-Overall I wouldn't put it at *Saving Private Ryan* level but it's definitely a very good film. If you like Nolan I'd go see it asap.

- Obviously I'd see it in the best possible format available to you (I saw it in 70mm) to get the full scale of what Nolan's trying to do.

I left the theatre overwhelmed and amazed. The score was spot on as expected, but the sounds of the stuka divebombers, or the thundering gunsounds of the He 111 made me come closer to understanding the dread that the soldiers must have felt during those days.

I did not need to know who was who and why. It was all about hunt (pilots), hide (the young men) and bringing home (Mr. Dawson). The tension throughout the movie was intense. There was always that impending feeling of doom, but with a small glimmer of hope to keep you going.

As for the movie...I am not really sure at this time. I know I liked it, but I also have things that bothered me or at least I think they did after a first watch. The movie is pretty experimental for Nolan. This movie is short, has rare dialogue, and does not focus on a character really. I know that it follows a few characters, but the characters don't really get developed but it seems intentional. The main character of the movie is the British soldiers stuck in Dunkirk. The anonymous soldier of war that is stuck and can't leave but must wait for death or a miracle. Most shots of the soldiers are showing many of them on screen. Maybe not most, but many are. 

In contrast, the civilians and other britishmen coming to Dunkirk are not shown until the end except for the one ship. It was a weird contrast to have those characters developed more than the soldiers. I actually liked it after thinking about it but during the movie, something just felt off. There was just not a character I gravitated too other Hardy because he did cool things.

It was frustrating at times because I couldn't understand what they were saying but the cinematography and the sounds/soundtrack were rlly what made the movie for me.

This is the war film that sets the bar high from now on. A lot of films love to romanticize war, but this film is pure raw emotion. Nothing will ever come close to actually having lived through the hardship of war, but this film respects that reality and presents it to you in an interactive format.

I definitely walked out feeling like I had spent more than 106 minutes in there. The film is pregnant with tension from the first moment until the last with Hardy being taken prisoner.
  
It's not as bloody as Private Ryan, but it's more psychologically intense. Being on the inside of a boat and waiting at any moment for a torpedo to hit and sink you, trapped inside to drown, kind of intensity. And when the tension breaks, it's loud and frightening.
  
I feel like it ended pretty powerfully, with the soldiers seeing that the public did not view them as failures or cowards, and Harry Stiles reading ""we will fight on the beaches,"" echoing, ""We will never surrender."" Especially powerful when you know a little history.

The pilot just looked on in silence.

That got me thinking. During the real life Dunkirk evacuation, how many men were saved because of the efforts of a few RAF pilots? How many more men would have been slaughtered had it not been for a few fighters keeping the German pilots at bay? That soldier, while understandably angry after being shot at on the beach for a week, had no idea that the RAF pilot might have been the reason he was even able to make it home. It was the little moments like this that made the film for me.",6ol0kp

On the beach with the men, it's pretty underwhelming the amount of people there were in some scenes being as there was literally 400,000 people there. Again with the same problem, I absolutely loved the scene where you saw the civilian boats coming in, but it was still not equal to what the actual numbers were surely? I know you can't hire this many people but there has to be technology that would allow this?

I couldn't imagine watching this in a regular theater. The IMAX was very much worth it, the visuals go without saying, but coupled with the *massive* sound just makes it all very exhilarating

dkmf3hv,"It's easy to be a critic, so of course, here's my criticism:

1) While I liked the split time ratios, like a reverse Inception, The Mole, which was supposed to be a week, did not feel like a week.  If you ripped any of the 3 storylines and watched them individually, I feel like this one needed more.  Anytime it was quiet, it was almost immediately interrupted by war, but over that week's time I'm pretty sure there were a lot more quiet moments of waiting.

2) The score was a little too relentless to the point by the end it stopped having any emotional effect on me.  I was almost tuning it out trying to latch onto sound effects.  Overall I really liked the score, I just wish it would have built more instead of just being elevated throughout.

My favorite parts were related to The Air & how parts of that were woven into the other parts, the rescue of the downed partner, the land soldiers watching Tom Hardy pick off potential attackers.  I almost wonder if The Air was presented as #1 & The Mole as #3 if it wouldn't have had an even stronger through line.  I was definitely more engaged in the dogfight scenes, to the point where I was trying to figure out the exact moment to pull the trigger.

I know some think Nolan's work is too loud but I love it & I love the fact he'll go into theaters to make sure they're playing it loud as hell.  Dunkirk definitely delivers on that front!

Overall, a solid film, 8/10, 4/5, 80/100 & so on.",6ol0kp

dkn8e66,"I saw it in IMAX 70mm last night.

Technically, this was a masterpiece. Nolan put his heart and soul into making this movie. The directing overall was incredibly well done. Also, unlike in some of his movies, I actually liked how the sound overpowered a lot of the dialouge. I feel like that effect works really well in the war environment.

But for the first half of the movie or so, it just wasn't clicking with me. I really didn't like how little connection was created between the audience and the characters. I wasn't looking for the war movie cliche of sitting around the campfire and telling the others about their lives at home or something like that, but they didn't even say the names of a lot of the characters, or if they did it was just drowned out. Around the half way point of the movie the whole style kind of clicked with me, and by the end I realized why everyone was acclaiming it so much, but that one missing character element really kind of hurt it for me. 

8.5/10, because I really liked everything about it except the missing character element.

Plus I saw it in D-BOX, which was a really fantastic experience. The perfect movie for it. ",6ol0kp
dksf43f,"Saw it last night.

It struck me as one of the more unique war movies that Ive seen.

As others have said I really appreciate what Nolan was going for (mostly). The thing I really loved was the sense of scale. Most war movies are so close to the characters that you almost forget where they are. Nolan manages to convey just how small humans are in their environment and how big a job the evacuation was.

In terms of performances. I really enjoyed Hardy + Lowden, Rylance, D'Arcy and Brannagh. The rest were ok although I didn't much care for Whitehead and the guys in that storyline.

The script seems to be a big bone of contention with some viewers. I can see why. As I walked out of the theatre I largely agreed with some of the criticism. Dialogue was maybe too thin and the character development was poor. I also didn't like the choppy timeline particularly.

However when you think about it, the way they've done this is the only way that would work. In the olden days this film would have been 50% on the beaches and then slowly working in the boats and planes OR it would have had to string out the Rylance and Hardy characters to the point of repetition. It largely applies to the script as well, does anyone really expect that all the men waiting nervously for the boats would have had hour long chats? Or that people flying fighter planes in combat situations do a lot of talking? Realistically all they could have done for Hardy was give a ground briefing before he and Lowden took off. I thought they got it right with Rylance and the officers on the Mole.

One of the big wins for this movie was the sound. I don't mean the music, which was awesome, but everything. The guns, planes, boats. It all sounded great. I really loved the use of ticking throughout as well.

Overall I really liked it. I still am slightly unsure about Whitehead's charmed life but apart from that little bit, it was pretty much on the money for what I wanted. That said - I wouldn't have been too sad if they'd gone massive and done a Battle of Britain-esque epic either.",6ol0kp

dl5wop6,"really enjoyed the movie. not the best movie but definitely on my top10 list now.

the opening scene in IMAX 70mm was amazing with the full height of the buildings. everything was great, from the tense background music, the loud war SFX, breathtaking visuals.

even the acting was incredible: the boat story had some great emotional, non-verbal acting (the kid and father's exchanged looks told more than words could ever have). the actual fear and reaction in the different soldiers.

One thing that bothered me was the transitions between IMAX and non-IMAX. If it was just the size of the image that changed, I wouldn't have noticed anything but the colour and image quality was a really noticeable change each time. I couldn't ignore it.
I'm not sure if it's possible to edit the nonIMAX closer to the colour/image closer to IMAX to lessen this or not.

dki7q2x,"I feel like I saw a completely different movie from everyone here. I found it extremely underwhelming and kind of dull. I just felt nothing really happened. I've seen almost everyone here say it was intense and stressful and I didn't feel that at all. 

Like someone else mentioned, a lot of tension was absent because I just didn't care about the characters. I realize it was probably intentional to have little dialogue and no back stories, but I don't think it panned out well. The only moments I felt genuinely thrilled and entertained were the moments with Tom Hardy. The stakes felt real with him and it just worked with his situation more than the sailor or the guys on the ground. 

I feel the trailer gives the impression that it's a fast paced thrill, but it felt very slow and lacked a ""wow"" moment that all of his other films had for me. 

I think the film is very well made, just not all that entertaining or interesting. I don't know what it is. I'm willing to say it's probably more of a problem with me because I see all the positivity from critics and this thread and think there's no way this many people are wrong. 

Another thing I keep seeing is how loud it is. My showing felt so quiet for a war film. Gunshots and explosions lacked power and punch. Maybe my theater just didn't present it right?

I know it sounds like I'm hating on it but I'm really not. All in all, I don't think it's a bad film at all, I just feel I had such a different experience than everyone here. 

I wish I prepared a bit more in terms of expectations. I went into it watching it like Batman/Inception/Interstellar but should have watched it like The Prestige.

dkl076g,"Just returned from seeing this movie. Wow, what an incredible film. From the opening gunshots, to the end scene, I was on the edge of my seat. My heart was actually racing at the end too.

The sound and cinematography really made this movie what it is. I have never actually seen a war movie that made me scared of the gunfire and planes. Dunkirk did just that. I also love the choice to go easy on dialogue. It lets the viewer soak in the true horrors of war and the situation without having the obvious explained to us.

Thought the acting was good enough to convince and immerse me into the film. I also really enjoyed the subtleness Nolan used to handle the political aspects of the war. Dunkirk doesn't get into the Axis v. Allies we have all heard for years and years. It focuses on the silent effort of a people to come to the rescue of their own, and does so almost flawlessly.

As someone who studies history, and plans to teach it, I must say that having a bit of the film dedicated to the ""halt order"" from the Germans would have helped depicted how the rescue was able to happen. As other might have noticed in the film, no German infantry crosses into the beach. Luftwaffe planes come one or two at a time. There are intriguing reasons for this, both environmental and strategic that I wish Nolan would have spent just a bit of time exploring.

Overall, this is a different kind of war movie. No ""hurr-rah"" for the troops. No strategy meetings. No images of world leaders. No major focus on the Axis v. Allies. The word ""Nazi"" is never said, and the words ""German"" or ""Kraut"" are said a handful of times. This movie is about the gritty determination of a people to survive and escape one of the worst situations in military history. Nolan puts you right in the action, and it is a hell of an experience.",6ol0kp
dklj1mq,"I liked it it a lot. I though it was visually stunning, very minimalist. I liked the minimal dialogue and minimal score, though it was very jarring at first since I'm so used to every scene having music. I think everyone acted incredibly well, and I was especially impressed by Fion. I thought it showed the desperation of war and what it does to generally good people very well.

There were a few things that bothered me though: [first, everything looked too clean, and a lot of things, like the buildings and street in the first scene and the train at the end, looked too modern to me. Also, at no point did we get the scale - there were no overshots showing hundreds of thousands of men on the beach. It seemed like there were a few hundred soldiers there at most. It was the same when the private boats came - I expected hundreds, but there were only about 20 boats. It also felt too short to me, like something was missing - I would like to see the director's cut.](#spoiler).",6ol0kp

dkn9vkp,"I enjoyed the movie for what it was, a huge war spectacle with amazing cinematography, special effects(most of it were practical instead of CGI), and its score. Tensions and suspense are high with each scene throwing the characters (Tommy especially) in one dangerous situation to the next. 

However, I didn't find myself connecting with any of the characters (nor did I remember any of their names until I looked up the Wikipedia summary) aside from maybe George just because you get the chance to understand his motivation. His death was tragic because it was by accident and caused by an ally, but at least he was commemorated at the end, fulfilling his wishes of making something of himself.  

I don't think it's the ""best war movie ever,"" but it was certainly good ,and I'm glad I experienced it in 70mm IMAX though I wish I sat back a bit further.

i'm pretty sure that's the message that nolan was trying to send. that soldiers are expendable and the only emotion you're supposed to feel in war is dread and tension. basically his message is that war sucks for everyone involved, even if it was a miracle that a majority of people got evacuated. 

loved the movie. still a bigger fan of his more creative films like inception and interstellar but this was still a top-notch film. if at  any point in the movie you felt tense, anxious or shocked then nolan did his job, that was his intention i believe. (everyone i went with put their hands towards their face or over their mouth during the water scenes, that's powerful moviemaking if you can force a physical reaction like that) soundtrack was beautiful too, carried the film in a lot of parts",6ol0kp
dlc0iun,"I didn't ""get"" it. 

The movie presents next to no historical/military context/strategy, so therefore must rely on emotional intensity and intrigue to impress. None of the characters are, well, characterized very much. A good chunk of them are passive, and don't make really make choices that affect the plot (or even seem to have names). I can't think of any memorable dialogue, not that there was much of it anyway. 

The movie depends not on a compelling narrative, nor on relatable characters, but rather on the raw emotion of war. And I didn't relate to the emotion the movie was trying to convey. War sucks. People die. They get shot, they get bombed, they drown, they get left behind. That's what people do in war. It's nothing I didn't already know, and nothing I wasn't prepared for. I went in ready to steel myself against the horrors that humanity inflicts upon itself, and was pretty underwhelmed.

A film with such a large budget and with such emphasis on sound I think was let down by a poor visual display of Dunkirk. The opening scene showed an untouched town and a pristine beach. No craters from bombs or even vehicle tracks in the sand. There was so much equipment left during the evacuation but for some reason was overlooked.

dkj801z,"**DUNKIRK IN ORDER** - *Hastily written before I forget.*     

Tommy wanders through the city, and eventually makes his way to the beach where he meets 'Gibson' burying a soldier and stealing his boots. They grab a soldier on a stretcher to sneak onto a hospital boat. Once on the boat, it is attacked by German planes and begins to sink at the harbor. Tommy rescues a fellow soldier on the sinking ship named Alex. Once safely back at the beach They are told they will 'find a new ship' for them. The three young men are taken via a rowboat to a bigger destroyer and climb aboard. 

That night the destroyer is attacked by a torpedo and they are forced to abandon ship. While in the water they encounter a rowboat full of soldiers and one (Cillian Murphy) tells them it is too full and to wait there and they will come back for them. The rowboat moves along and the boys grab a rope and secretly tow themselves behind it back to Dunkirk.

By Dawn they have made it to shore and take refuge on the beach. Eventually they see a group of Highlanders walking towards an abandoned trawler that is stuck on the beach. They say they are going to wait until high tide and escape.

Somewhere in here Cillian Murphy's character would have absconded on a ship and been attacked.  

**THIS IS WHERE THE SEA, AND AIR STORIES ENTER**  

The next morning Mr. Dawson, his son Peter and a kid named George set sail for Dunkirk to evacuate soldiers in their yacht 'The Moonstone'.

While in the trawler Tommy, Gibson, Alex, and the highlanders encounter a dutch sailor who owns the boat and hid on the beach as they are in enemy territory. They come under fire by enemy soldiers who want to ensure the trawler never floats. We find out Gibson is french.

The Moonstone comes across a sunken ship with a man on the hull 'Shivering Soldier' who is the same man who denied the boys access to their rowboat.
He does not want to go back to Dunkirk.

Three RAF Pilots, Farrier, Collins and the Commander are en route to provide air support for Dunkirk in their Spitfires. They encounter a German plane and in the battle the commander goes down, and Farrier's fuel gage is broken.

On The Moonstone, Shivering Soldier freaks out about going back to Dunkirk and in a scuffle, George is knocked over and hits his head.

The tide picks up and the trawler with Tommy, Alex, and Gibson is sinking but floating towards a friendly destroyer while still taking fire from the beach.

Collin's plane takes fire and he is forced to make a water landing, after landing he realizes his canopy won't open and his cabin is filling with water. He is rescued by The Moonstone that was floating nearby. They notice a destroyer being bombed up ahead and head for it, they also see the fishing trawler sinking nearby.

The Destroyer is leaking oil as men abandon ship. The Trawler is sinking and Gibson drowns trying to make it out alive. Alex and Tommy make it safely aboard The Moonstone and find George dead below deck.

Farrier engages the bomber above the sinking tanker and shoots him down, inadvertanly causing the flaming wreckage to engulf the oil in the water and setting ablaze many friendly soldiers, including one of the Highlanders.

The civilian boats arrive on the beach to begin the rescue.

The Moonstone makes it's get away as Farrier decides to use the remaining fuel he has left to defend the soldiers on the beach from an oncoming bomber. He successfully does so and is forced to land in enemy territory and is captured after using his flare gun to destroy his plane.

The Boys are taken safely across the channel and put on a train. Alex fears they will be labeled cowards and no one will celebrate their cowardice.

The next morning they arrive home to find they are celebrated for their heroic survival. Tommy reads Churchill's address on the matter.

Sometime later Peter goes to the Herald and makes sure they publicize the heroic efforts of George at Dunkirk.

I thought they kind of underplayed how many boats came to save the soldiers (looked like a few but there were 700 over the course of 10 days).

dkl80ui,"The thing that stood out most while watching Dunkirk was its ability to create mood and atmosphere. As the screen filled up with these huge, gorgeously shot images, combined with Hans Zimmer's pulse pounding sound design, it did an amazing job of ramping up tension and making the viewer uneasy, much like what the soldiers must have felt. 

Where the film may fall flat for some is that it does very little in terms of story or character development, so there's not much to get you invested. The closest we get is Mark Rylance's character, a civilian sailor who attempts to rescue as many soldiers as possible. Also, despite the minimal dialogue and character interactions, the actors are able to convey a lot just with facial expressions. There are also parts that examine other aspects of war, like PTSD, and not everyone is an action hero, in fact, most are just scared young men (kids really) wanting to go home. These elements are subtle though, as the movie seems more about the situation at hand than the people involved. It's a survival story.

The film employs a non linear structure taking place from 1 hour to 1 week into the evacuation, and is told across three perspectives: the land, the sea, and the air. The lack of external shots in some sequences (like inside the abandoned boat) made it difficult at times to understand what exactly was going on. This, combined with the out of order nature of scenes, could be disorienting at times, but usually you could make some sense of it as things rolled on.

Dunkirk is definitely a film worth seeing and one that must be seen in a theater on the largest screen and best sound system you can find, but it's more of a technical showpiece than a compelling drama, and I found myself wishing it could have been both.

That doesn't mean that the film is not awesome it's just that he's different of what we could expect from Nolan. As a matter of fact I actually loved the movie and of course especially the end which were sublime to me . I felt really involved in the fate of those anonymous soldiers . An  another aspect which is interesting is that the characters are just soldiers like there were hundred of thousands other at the time . The strength of this film is its atmosphere reinforced by and amazing work on the song. And there are scene absolutely insanely good like the first one when the soldiers and one of the main charactear are being chase down by the Germans and the one from the beach when you see tom hardy in his plane which doesn't make any noise because it has no fuel and everyone knows that he saved them by sacrificing himself that was so devastating . ,6ol0kp
dklguef,Saw it in 70mm IMAX. It was downright astounding. Simply the most intense movie I've ever seen in my life.,6ol0kp
dkltlbt,"I really enjoyed this movie visually, but I left feeling like the only character I gave a shit about by the end was Tom Hardy's pilot character (of which I don't even remember the name sadly).  The character development felt chaotic, and maybe that was the intent...but as a viewer, it made me feel somewhat unsatisfied in that aspect.

The pace of the movie was really interesting, but at times felt a little hard to follow, as there were not significant strides to focus in on how the different perspectives were pointing at the same core story point.  Several times I found myself going ""Oh, now I see where we are..."", which isn't a bad thing really because it made sense...but I think I personally like a more natural flow, even with Nolan's style of showing several perspectives heading to the same climax...this film didn't feel like it had that flow, but I was still able to see the progression without having to rewatch.

The score was breath taking.  But that isn't surprising at all considering who was at the helm.

It was a very intense, beautiful and overwhelming film to watch.  Me and my girl saw it in 70mm, and while I don't have a regular viewing to compare/contrast to, I didn't regret the extra cost to see it in such a grand way, as the enormity of the movie seemed to call for just that.",6ol0kp
dkmjfea,Amazing movie.  It was great to not have some contrived bullshit drama or love story thrown in.  It was purely a story of survival.,6ol0kp

[Check out the latest Friends and Film Podcast for our full discussion](https://soundcloud.com/friends-film/dunkirk-review-blade-runner-2049-trailer)

Christopher Nolan tackled a genre in a way that only Christopher Nolan knows how. 


With a ticking score by Hans Zimmer, a steel blue color pallet, an immersive IMAX experience, stunning realism, and a non-linear timeline that moves you through moment to moment of the nightmares that the British Expeditionary Force, Royal Air Force, and patriotic citizens faced on the beaches of Dunkirk, France, and the English Channel. 

The film and the experience of seeing it in IMAX felt like a technological and social experiment combined into one. The first being, ""what are the true limits of story telling immersion?,"" and the second being, ""How long can an audience collectively hold their breaths?""
Those answers respectively being, this movie and 1 hour and 45 minutes.

With the films ""heroes"" roles given to brilliant veterans like Mark Rylance, Kennth Branagh, or Tom Hardy, Nolan cast two virtual unknowns in the roles of the soldiers we were to follow on the beaches of Dunkirk. 

They aren't given names, they aren't given pasts, and they barely speak until the closing moments of the film. Nolan wanted us to see the movie from their eyes, but only that. They were a vessel for us to live the battle. 

Nolan's Dunkirk veers dramatically from all previous war films that have ended up on the silver screen. The film doesn't exist to tell a story of personal triumph during the most apocalyptic time in world history, but instead wants you to feel as viscerally as possible, what those souls on beach, in the sea, and up in the air were enduring. And it does just that. 
You feel the fear and anxiety of a man afraid to go below deck, you agree with the shell shocked soldier who is desperate not to go back, and you're counting down the gallons of fuel that Tom Hardy has left in his spitfire. 

The result is one of the most naturally aggressive stories ever to be on screen. 




",6ol0kp
dkvk9z6,"OK I might sound like a crazy fangirl but the more you watch Dunkirk, the more you'll appreciate it. I really recommend seeing this a second time to fully digest Nolan's fine art of pulling these stories together. His attention to detail is insane, you definitely can't recognize just how much after one watch. Even though I've seen this a ridiculous number of times now, the sound STILL manages to scare the shit out of me. And I still can't get over the very beginning and cinematography. We see beautiful Dunkirk, and the water and sky, devastated by way.",6ol0kp
dld7eez,[deleted],6ol0kp
dki6c13,"So, yeah, it's uh... perfect. Nolan's best. Just an absolute fucking triumph of filmmaking. And far more emotional than I expected. I've never cried during a film before, but Jesus. I mean, my God. ",6ol0kp
dki7d1w,"Nolan is one of my favorite filmmakers around, if not favorite. 

After watching Dunkirk, my only actual complaint is that I 'miss' an original story by him. And that's not a valid complaint when looking at the film as a whole, since it's a film grounded in absolute reality, with his take on storytelling methods and individual characters. 

I really think it's as close to a perfect movie he's done. Is it my favorite of his? Nope. But from a place of 'forced' objectivity, there are really no negatives in this movie. Can't wait to see it again. ",6ol0kp
dki7kd6,"In the words of Jonathan Nolan, that was a relentless fucking experience.",6ol0kp
dki9zo6,"I liked it, didn't love it though. Had tons of beautiful shots and great tension, but it just lacked something that would have made me love it. 


I do plan on seeing it again but not in IMAX, because it was so damn loud I was fighting a headache and hearing loss instead of focusing on the film. ",6ol0kp
dkia73m,"This movie in IMAX was a fucking EXPERIENCE. I've never been in a sold out theater where no one moved, no one ate or drank their food, no one made a single noise. Everyone was so invested in the film and on the edge of their seats the entire time. When it finally ended, everyone left in total silence. I have too many jumbled thoughts about the actual film that will need separate post when I can coherently express them",6ol0kp
dkicqle,"Something my SO pointed out that I thought I'd share. I've seen a few things on the fact that the enemy is ominous and mysterious throughout the film, but I believe Nolan did it for a very specific reason. 

This isn't about fighting or winning. It's truly about survival. No German soldiers' faces were shown because we weren't meant to consider it. That's why Hardy being captured was so jarring.",6ol0kp
dkidkkt,Nolan is obsessed with time. He always uses it in unique ways. This movie had the intensity and suspense of Gravity. Thought it was great. The scores ticking was a constant reminder that time was running out. ,6ol0kp
dkieaop,"SEE IT IN IMAX. Many have mentioned the quality of the audio and the visuals. I highly agree. I'll add that it's one of few chances to see a magnificent IMAX movie in 2D. it's a totally different and superior experience, IMO. ",6ol0kp
dkifbm3,Thank god im not claustrophobic/hydrophobic because I would have had a full on panic attack.,6ol0kp
dkig5qc,I was sold from the shot of the main character face down in the sand with the bombs coming towards him.  From that moment I was expecting the character to die at any moment and it was terrifying ,6ol0kp
dkiggx2,"I really liked this movie even though I'm more of a dialogue guy. I loved the moment when all the civilian ships came down, it's really amazing that so many citizens sacrificed their life in their tiny little boats to save their own soldiers, really giving insight into the total war circumstances of WWII. ",6ol0kp
dkikbqw,"Just watched it at a new theatre in my (fairly) small city. Didn't find it as loud as some said here, or maybe my theatre is just shitty (first time I went there, so I can't really compare).

All the actors deliver their parts well, but Tom Hardy's part is the one that got me most. His acting is very subtle, but damn that scene at the end and earlier when he realized that he couldnt go back almost made me cry.

I think it's more of a survival film than a war film, really making you feel that no one is actually safe, you could be killed at any time, and once you're dead, it didn't even matter to the war at large. If given the chance, I'd love a second viewing.",6ol0kp
dkikejw,watch it in IMAX with a 'good seat'. ,6ol0kp
dkilpwk,Nolan's restraint was pleasantly surprising. Hope he keep this up.,6ol0kp
dkimfhy,Reminded me of a tighter Thin Red Line. ,6ol0kp
dkin40c,The opening was so intense. It was one of the best openings I've seen in a film since Sicario.,6ol0kp
dkismey,"This film knocked my socks off! The only thing I could possibly fault was that the soundtrack sometimes overwhelmed the dialogue. Still, would go again and experience it all over! ",6ol0kp
dkiy0vv,"Thought the movie was great and enjoyable. A nice mesh of the Nolan-film and war film. However, as some people have said, one of Nolan's main weaknesses is poor characters and dialogue and this movie did well to play more to his strengths by omitting a lot of dialogue and character. 

This has already been mentioned before but the movie did also feel small - because of the fact that Nolan doesn't like to use CGI. But it's only a minor gripe.

On a side note, I was confused at this point but why did Tom Hardy's character decide to land the plane instead of jumping out? ",6ol0kp
dkj864f,"this is the first time i watch a movie with history as a key element of it, and walked out of theater feeling really satisfied with it, the 3 perspective really well done, every moment in the movie you could actually feeling so intense about the characters, knowing they could just fucking die in a matter of seconds.. and this is the first time i feel really getting scared shit of a war just because of a movie..


at this point Nolan could just make a movie with a title like ""a Movie created by Nolan"" and i will still watch that.",6ol0kp
dkj86gd,"I really loved this. I was not expecting this to be such a straightforward yet intimate look into escaping the war. That was what this movie was for me: escape. I was very much along for the ride -- stunning visuals and sound. Hoyte's cinematography was superb. I'm thinking about seeing it again before it's out of theaters because it was such an experience. A+ filmmaking. 

Did anyone else think the moment at the end [when Harry Styles' character said that the blind man ""wouldn't even look at us?"" was a bit strange? I understood the inclination of feeling shame for failing at the beach and returning home...but I remember thinking it was a strangely executed moment.] (#spoiler)",6ol0kp
dkjb09l,"I genuinely enjoyed this movie. I don't think I liked it as much as some of the people here, but I definitely felt satisfied.

The timelines at the start kinda confused me, but as it went on I was able to figure it out and it clicked at the end.

Also, I purposeful watched and read as little as possible before I watched it. I think my expectations were for more of a ""traditional"" war movie, if that makes sense. Like a Saving Private Ryan. But by no means was I left disappointed. I really liked the way the movie played out. I could feel the desperation of the men in the movie trying whatever they could to survive and to get out. Never once did I think ""cowards"". That's exactly how any man would react in the situation. The air story was my favorite, I think.

Overall, didn't enjoy it as much as some of the people in the thread, it seems. It was a great experience though. Anybody else feel the same?",6ol0kp
dkjbab8,"I like how the Germans were never really framed as enemies, but as danger through their machines. It was about men trying to escape the danger of death, not fighting back. 

Also the sound was brilliant. I've never been scared by sound or dreading how loud something is going to be as much as I was in this film.",6ol0kp
dkjkm8i,"Goddamn the torpedo scene had me white-knuckling my chair like crazy. Seriously though, this entire movie was stressful for me in the best way possible. Almost every scene has some sort of ""race against time"" element to it, and the soundtrack + non-linear narrative only made it even more intense.

Really enjoyed it.",6ol0kp
dkjlwfg,Gotta love the stoic fishermen not responding to the cheers of the saved soldiers,6ol0kp
dkjsql5,"This was incredibly intense. The most tense one for me was probably when they were on the boat that was getting shot at and they were trying to get the French soldier off the boat. 

 Sure we didn't get to know many of the characters but I didn't really care too much about that - plus I actually felt moved when the kid on the boat got George into the newspaper as a hero.",6ol0kp
dkjtna3,"Managed to catch it in 70mm and wow, it was gorgeous.

Nolan's finest movie yet. All his visual strengths, supplemented by the lack of dialogue and his need to overexplain. 

A pure experience.",6ol0kp
dkjxb6e,"To the people who saw it in IMAX 70mm, was the theater full or empty?",6ol0kp
dkjzdsy,"So someone said that there was allegedly only 40 to 50 lines of dialogue in the film so I decided to count. It has around 355 discernable lines of dialogue throughout the entire course of the film. 

The average two hour film has about 1000 - 1500 lines of dialogue. So still pretty limited.",6ol0kp
dkjziy3,Wow that was an amazing movie. Took a couple minutes after leaving the theatre for my anxiety to go away haha. Loved it. Really good movie. I could see why many won't like it though. ,6ol0kp

dkkqk0y,"Saw it 70mm. When the final scene went silent, and you could here the film reel spin to a halt, it was perfect.",6ol0kp
dkkriw9,Can someone explain why Hardys character didn't try to land closer to where all the Brits were? It seemed like he was a very talented pilot who could have found a way ,6ol0kp
dkkrkfw,"Fuck, that scene where the little ships pass the destroyer and Cillian Murphy smiles and tears up was amazing.  Such a stark contrast of hope and pride with the rest of the film, and also I'm pretty sure the only major chord in the entire soundtrack.",6ol0kp

dkkwxel,Could those destroyers not fire a single shot at the attacking Germans?,6ol0kp
dkkz19n,Did anyone else REALLY want to jump on BF1 after watching this?,6ol0kp
dkl4fu1,"Just got out. I liked it. Different though and I'm not sure how I feel about that. Took me till that smaller trawling ship to realize how the stories were being shown.

Honestly my favorite parts were all the plane scenes. Great cinematography and sound design in those scenes. And I'm only a little biased towards WWII planes. Seriously, give me a two and a half hour movie about the planes. Please. The scenes with the plane gliding over the beach, no sound, were beautiful.

One thing that kind of bugged me was the beach. Aren't there supposed to be almost 500,000 men at Dunkirk? This scale was completely missing and I feel like it detracts from portraying the sheer scale of the evacuation required. 

Not specifically about the movie, but the theatre I saw it in was way to loud. The group next to me even said the same thing. The Dolby Atmos is cool, but turn the damn volume down a notch.  ",6ol0kp
dkl8fnm,"What did everyone think about the man handing out food at the railway station, saying well done?",6ol0kp
dkla1oo,"There are so many reasons I love this film. Something that just occurred to me is the fact that we get no backstory. It starts smack dab in the middle of the British forces being trapped with no references as to why or how.

I feel like this is awesome because instead of answering those questions, it will lead people to do research and learn about the subject. Upon leaving, soooo many people including my mom stated something along the lines of wanting to look up the actual historic facts. One of the few movies to inspire curiosity in history. Amazing.",6ol0kp
dklamaf,"I saw it today in an IMAX theater. Very good movie, stunning visuals and sound, although I'm not sure I would go as far as some of the reviews in praising it.

Nolan's point obviously is to provide an immersive experience, and he succeeds completely. As others have noted, the movie is LOUD, and yet about halfway through the movie I got used to used it. For me the adjustment came from the sense that I was there, on the beach, on the sea, and in the air.

I'm not sure what to make of the lack of dialogue. It adds somehow to the immersive effect. I think it's because I don't need all the exposition and I really don't need to hear about ""my girl back home"", as someone else put it. We know exactly what Tom Hardy's pilot is thinking or what Tommy is planning when hiding under the mole. Almost all the mundane complexities of life have been stripped out, and most dialogue is superfluous (I kinda wonder what Titanic would be like, if Cameron had used a similar approach). Right now my view is that the simplification of these people's lives does put a limit on the film. But maybe that's another point, that war makes us very simple people. Anyway, the fact that we grasp these people's struggles so intuitively sucks us into the movie quickly and effectively.

I do appreciate Nolan's discipline. Apparently some people, including [this idiot](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/the-dumbing-down-of-dunkirk-1500592065#), did not. If you're going to let the pictures do the talking, then the film is best served to fall a certain path, and Nolan did follow that path.

Two other random thoughts:

I love the way Rylance says ""Dunkirk"" when talking to the shivering soldier. There's something about it that sounds so 1940's English.

I read that the film had thousands of extras and made some attempt to eschew CGI. I understand the lines of reasoning there, that the film was striving for authenticity, that CGI can become a rabbit hole and it doesn't always age well, but I think to convey the sheer magnitude of the operation, the movie would benefit from a few hundred thousand CG troops and a few hundred of the little civilian ships.",6ol0kp
dklc4i3,I have a question? Does anyone know what happened to Cillian Murphy between not letting them on the boat and being picked up?,6ol0kp
dklgu46,Which guy was Harry Stiles?,6ol0kp
dklpfaf,Was there any reason that Fionn Whitehead had no reaction to all the other guys dying at the start?,6ol0kp
dklryb9,"For me this is now the most ""Visually magnificent"" Nolan-movie ever. The way the screenplay is intertwined between [the 3 acts ,Mole, Sea and Air](#spoiler) is a refreshing manner of dealing with the timelines.
Most of the cinematic achievement has been discussed already in the thread.
Another thing that i noticed in editing as well as photography that there wasn't a single shot that was out of someone's point of view. Every frame was part of someone's story. 
Beautiful!

dkm6jnm,Why didn't Tom Hardy just jump out of the plane after he got passed the last group of soldiers? ,6ol0kp
dkmdmy1,"Loved the movie and really have no issues with it. One of my favorite moments in the film is when Tommy finally gets on the train rests his head against his pillow and for the first time there is absolute silence. No score, no talking in the background or a ticking clock noise, nothing. Dead silence, the only time in the film. It was incredibly impactful. ",6ol0kp
dkmei8q,I teared up at the end when Tom Hardy's plane made it's peaceful descent onto the beach during the sunset. that was such an amazing release for the tension that we had endured for ... however long the movie was. I only hope he survived being captured by the Germans. ,6ol0kp

dkmh6u5,"*Spoilers*

Just watched Dunkirk. Struggled a bit to get into the film the first 30 minutes I must admit but after that it grabbed me and didn't let go.
Some brilliant shots or scenes: when Tommy is on the beach and the bombs are edging closer and closer and eventually stop and the sand drops on him.

The first shot after the torpedo hits the boat and the perfect representation of the disorientation and panic that follows.

The shot of the French soldier reaching for the ladder but not quite reaching it. Heartbreaking.

As many have mentioned, when Tom Hardy's plane runs out of fuel and he opens his cockpit to hear the cheers. Also the shot with his plane burning behind him.",6ol0kp
dkmpxjo,"Good movie, the only thing I'd like to comment on is, when the pilot ran out of fuel he glides around and made a couple rounds before he landed. How real is that or it's just a nice way to end a suspenseful film with something that may not be possible. I enjoyed the film that was the only thing I had a gripe with but still no biggie. ",6ol0kp

dknh6nb,"I really loved the movie. Especially as a cinematic experience. I didn't want to know more about the characters and was tense/anxius throughout even on second viewing. One thing I didn't like was the disjointed story. The first time I saw it, I didn't know who was who and was confused whether the different scenes were flashbacks or current. The second time I saw it, I really paid attention the multiple stories and aligning them, and I get how it's ""genius"" but I also found it really distracting from the overall experience. Things made a lot more sense the 2nd time, but I felt like I was watching a different movie when trying to follow along the disjointed story.

Still give it a 8/10 though.",6ol0kp
dkp0s6r,Hated Harry Styles' character after he was pushing for Gibson to be thrown out.  Gibson saved his life about 3 times in the movie and then he just turns on him like that.  Tommy also should have waited for Gibson to make it to the ladder.  ,6ol0kp
dkpiw0r,"loved it for all the reasons others have highlighted, my favourite being the thumping base that reverberated in my chest as the dog fight was about to begin.

One thing I didn't understand was what happened to the french guy, did Harry Styles kill him? I didn't really understand what I was seeing.

One stupid quibble, I know they made a choice not to use CGI but the background was filled with modern buildings that looked out of place. When he's taking a shit on the beach you can see 1990's houses with skylights in the roof, the beach front was covered in 1960/70s architecture and other beach scenes had massive container cranes in the background.",6ol0kp

It did set up that amazing connection between the red mock neck son and the Shivering Soldier where the son lied that George would be alright, but it just seemed weird to have to kill that kid off.

dl58vlm," One thing that you can expect from Nolan's movie is that the cinematography is really incredible. I thought the action scenes especially with the aerial dogfight scenes with Tom Hardy were pretty accurate not to mention tense. I'll say this movie really kept me on the edge of my seat. The first 2 minutes it was like I was actually in a battlefield, the sounds of gunfire right in the beginning as I said really tense were pretty jarring though that may have been because I saw it in IMAX. By the way if you can and are willing to spend the extra money I'd highly recommend seeing it in IMAX.

My problems with the movie and they are really just kind of nitpicks were and I really don't want to give too much away in case if anyone reads this hasn't seen the movie yet....there were just some moments where I couldn't understand what some of the characters were saying. This seen sort of near the end where the group of soldiers we have been following are getting shot at, they were yelling at this one guy and I just wasn't able to understand what they were saying. There were some confusing moments too where we see one character at one moment in the film then we see him again at a completely different location, but I think we do realize that the way the story (or events) is being told isn't exactly in sync (in order). Some events happen at one time and some at another depending on which characters we are watching.

Anyways it's a great movie overall I'd say.",6ol0kp

dklqrym,"Saw it on Friday, needed some time to process it. In short, I loved it, thought it was brilliant. Even for Nolan it felt strangely experimental for such a huge mainstream movie. I even got a little misty eyed out of patriotic pride. Especially when seeing that spitfire glide above the beaches to Zimmer's slowed down rendition of Elgar. This is at a time, when I scarcely recognise my country anymore in the wake of Brexit. So no small feat by any means.   

Back when it was announced that Nolan's next project would be a war movie, I think most people realised that we wouldn't be getting another traditional war movie. He would of course be doing something clever with it. Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan effectively set the bar for all WWII movies when it was released in 1999. See Enemy at the Gates or Mel Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge which was definitely in the same mould. Specifically utilising gore and violence to show the hell and horror of war.  

As a British person, the evacuation of Dunkirk is a pretty monumental part of British history. It's drilled into you through history lessons, the 'dunkirk' spirt, the 'blitz' spirit is part of our national character. Or at least how we'd preferred to all be seen. A group of ordinary people from this small island nation rising against overwhelming power and odds to do something great. You look at movies like Brassed Off, The Full Monty, Pride and these are movies about that. Earlier this year, we had Their Finest released, which was about a bunch of ragtag film makers who come together to make a movie about Dunkirk during the height of the Blitz. It far different to Nolan's version, but there are a couple of similarities. 

I think the biggest thing, is that Nolan understands that the war movie has an elevated responsibility in today's world. It's been over 70 years since the end of World War 2, and as a people, it is send that collectively we have a historical and cultural memory that lasts as far back as our grandparent's life times. As time progresses, and we are forced to deal with newer problems and there is a threat that we forget the errors we made in the past, which leaves us in danger of making the same errors in the future. It is through war movies, (and probably video games) that we remember and relive these massive conflicts. 

I think this is why Dunkirk feels so immediate and authentic. It's not as if we are getting a traditional three act war movie. We don't get expository scenes from Churchill's war room, we don't get scenes of soldiers bonding and talking forlornly about their romantic partners back home. Most of the soldiers are almost anonymous. It is through their desperate predicament of being stuck upon this beach, this purgatorial realm, in which home and salvation is in sight in the background. Harry Styles is in this movie, but it's not as if he's does anything of particular significance. We don't particularly get to know him as a character. He becomes slightly xenophobic in his desperate plight to survive. But in the end, he's just another face, another number to save.

So if feels very immediate, but at the same time, such is Dunkirk within our cultural memory, we already know how it ends. So then Nolan crafts a story with so many things in the balance, so many things there to create tension. He introduces the three timelines playing out at the same time, which at first feels a little jarring, as day turns to night in a scene. It almost feels like shellshock, but then you eventually start following it, and understand how it brings subtle revelations to the story as it is happening and delayed pay offs. Again if this was a conventional three act structure, there would be character arcs, a big climactic set piece, things and characters set up in the beginning would find resolution. But that's not what the Dunkirk evacuation was about, it was a great military success snatched out of the gaping maw of defeat. Every loss of life and small victory plays out at once, a bit like how history does within our collected conscious. This bends the movie towards it's big theme which is - SURVIVE, SURVIVE, SURVIVE. Live so you may fight another day. As Dunkirk was just the beginning, it wouldn't be until D-day that the allies would take back mainland Europe with the help of the US. 

Like Inception, the music of Dunkirk is built around the ticking of the clock. Apparently this was recorded from Nolan's own pocket watch, which is basically a pretty good metaphor for his films in general. Immaculately/ingeniously designed and built, with many moving parts and ideas coming together to form this big event movie. And of course, the clock symbolises how Nolan likes to use the language of film to play with time in new and interesting ways. Once again Hans Zimmer is on his A-game, creating this mechanical soundtrack that organically feeds into exactly what is happening on screen. How distorted strings are used to create sirens, or percussive elements emulate the sound of boots running across metal ship decks. And the way it finally lifts when salvation arrives with the slowed down version of Elgar. Which is just magical.    

If anyone cares, I wrote a longer review [here](http://youheardgoodthings.com/dunkirk/). I thought it was fantastic, easily one of the best films of the year, probably my favourite Nolan movie since Inception. See it on the biggest screen you can. ",6ol0kp

I'm a big Nolan fan and to me just purchasing a ticket to his new film was a treat. 

I also usually catch up with what's going on in his films fairly fast. My girlfriend however hates him, she says his films make her feel dumb. 

In Dunkirk, it took me about 80 minutes to understand the timeline of the events, and what those titles at the beginning meant (1 week on the shore, one day at sea and 1 hour on the air). I explained it to her and she was already completely lost. 

Now I have to watch it again, because by the time I realized I was inceptioned, I missed a whole lot. 

Another thing I noticed in this was Nolan introducing (what I call now) Silent Conflicts - he shows us a lock and we ask ourselves - should he lock the door? He shows us low gauge but there are still enemy planes - should Tom Hardy say and fight? I found it really cool and a bit different from Nolan. 

Other than that this film is stunning, and great on the ears (although a bit loud).

But I love Nolan's films because they are of the few films that are able to equally balance flawed, developed characters and mind-bending ideas, with big budget action spectacle and set pieces.

I walk away disappointed in this film as a Nolan effort completely lacking in character development or ideas. Cool spectacle, but it's not like there's a shortage of that in Hollywood.

Maybe it's ahead of it's time as a VR film instead.

dkiz1v3,"I believe the fighter pilot (Tom Hardy) was a symbol for Britain's resolve. The last few moments bordered on fantastical with how the plane was able to make several passes while gliding and take down two planes in the process. Spitfires simply wouldn't be able to maintain altitude for that long.

But when he opens the canopy then hears the cheers of his brothers and closes it, it's clear he is sacrificing his rescue for the sake of morale. He has to fly off as the victor so they have something to believe in. He is the one man on that entire beach not obsessed with escaping.

I also think it's telling how he so gently puts the plane down, riding the coast line for miles, and vigorously pumping the landing gear to make sure his plane lands smoothly.

Only to get out, shoot the fuselage which had threatened to take him down for most of the movie, and watch it go up in flames as the Germans surround him.

 I also liked Cillian Murphy’s acting. I didn't find him a coward because I think I would probably have done the same... and when he said ""Is the boy going to be allright?"" I truly felt for him. I do wish we got to see what happened to make him shell shocked; especially because he was fairly calm and collected in the scene where he was in the small boat at night. 

I felt myself caring the least for the younger actors but I did think they did a good job. (I didn't once feel like I was watching a boyband singer, Harry Styles was professional in his role.) I think I have nothing but good words for this film. The Navy Captain or I dunno what his correct character's name is was astounding as well, he brought so much emotion to his part  (when he saw the boats from home), the soundtrack was overwhelming in a good way, I loved the 70mm format.. nothing but good, in my eyes.",6ol0kp

dkrmft8," 'Dunkirk' is a good war movie and works as a beautifully shot (seriously, the airborne sequences in this film were breathtaking at times in IMAX), tightly plotted, impeccably edited visceral representation of a truly remarkable event in World War 2 history and delivers on the experience. However, I did feel that cinematically, it falters as a film that is emotionally or emphatically deep enough to draw us in, having no specific character to latch on to. Now, I am aware that it was Nolan's intention to make us experience the event as a whole rather than focus on characters but since the event itself is about survival, not having well-developed characters (especially since, unlike the event it's based on, the characters themselves are fictitious in the film) to care about results in the film basically amounting to us watching people waiting to die/escaping death's grasp in a split-second with only a modicum of emotional investment ( mainly because of them being fellow human beings). It's like if the sinking scene in Titanic were feature length instead of 30 minutes long but there was no backstory, no Jack, no Rose or any character for that matter for us to gravitate towards, to actually care that such a horrible disaster has happened. That being said, let me repeat that Dunkirk is good war film that I liked (repeat, I LIKED it) and I urge you to watch the film in the biggest screen that you possibly can.
However, if you do end up liking the film, I also humbly urge you to watch Saving Private Ryan, Das Boot, The Hurt Locker, Band of Brothers (not a movie, but a miniseries), The Pacific (miniseries), Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now and Platoon before you decide whether Dunkirk fits the pedestal of 'greatest war movie ever made'.",6ol0kp

This isn't Nolan's best work, I'm sorry to say, but there are some good parts of it.

None of the characters are really developed at all. I don't really know anything about these characters, but the little moments they have are often quite captivating. The ending is particularly emotional. The whole movie long, I couldn't tell you a thing about Tom Hardy's character, but seeing him get to hear the applause of the men he saved and then the little moment where you're not sure if he's gonna make it out alive or not, before being caught by the Germans is a rollercoaster of emotions. The movie's ending is probably the best part (in large part due to the nice payoff of the three ""timelines"" finally converging""). The whole fact that the three parts of the movie  are on different, uh, time...frames? God how do you even characterize it? Well whatever you call it, that idea is interesting, but it took me a while to figure out exactly what was happening, and I consider myself fairly observant in these sorts of things.

I think this movie was a case of spectacle over story. The visuals were good but they weren't backing up good characters. IMAX is definitely the way to see it (I honestly don't know anything about 70 MM, but that too is probably something you should look into if you wanna see it) but I don't know if this was the type of movie I felt right dishing out that kind of cash for.

Alas, a couple of the basic decisions on storytelling did cause some issues for me.  First, the lack of dialogue and character development.  That by itself is not the problem.  The problem it caused was that masses of young men in uniforms or in the water and with chaos around them meant it was very hard to tell them apart, and I had trouble telling who was who a lot of the time.  It was even worse for the RAF pilots.  Aside from the one who had the damaged instrumentation you couldn't tell one from another most of the time, and so it was confusing.  The passing of time when it came to the pilots was also an issue.  For example, did the one who was low on fuel go home and launch again, or was his time in the air all the same mission despite the longer passage of time for other characters in the movie?

The other problem was from the lack of a standard story structure.  I guess they kind of had it where it is supposed to build up to a climax, but by choosing the evacuation of Dunkirk as the whole movie basically the whole thing was the climax of the story.  It was always dialed-up to between 7 and 10, and so when the actual climax hit I didn't really feel like things were elevated much over the rest of the movie and so when it came and went it felt strangely...flat.  Not bad or weak since it was still dialed-up pretty high, but just not a build-up to a big peak.  Another reason for that was that the threat of the Germans closing in on them was primarily out-of-sight, and so although we kind of knew that the noose was tightening around them and the clock was almost at zero for them, we couldn't actually tell just how close.  And so the drama of the last-minute rescue by the cavalry (the small boats) didn't necessarily feel like the last minute since the danger they were in at that time seemed not much different than what we had just seen for the past hour and a half.  So that left me feeling a bit unsatisfied despite how much I enjoyed the movie.

With a more standard narrative the whole evacuation itself would have been the climax after a build up of the story of the BEF and the French getting driven back by the Blitzkrieg.  So it would have built up to a peak instead of staying at or near the peak from start until the end.

Anyway, despite those issues it is still quite an experience, and a definite thumbs up.  It will be one of those movies I watch again because of the way it makes me *feel*, similar to why I like to re-watch *Interstellar*.",6ol0kp

dkidr3y,"Okay. Christopher Nolan is my personal favourite director so its hard for me to put this into words. This film was a disappointment for me in a few areas. In my opinion one of Nolan's strengths has been his ability to choose one or two characters and focus on them for an extended period, developing them and drawing the audience into their story in the process. I think when Nolan said this was his most experimental film he meant it, but I don't think it paid off. There was a lack of real character development due to the multiple story lines which pulled you away from tense situations for minutes at a time. For me this gave the film a really unfocused feeling. This meant that I couldn't enjoy this film as much as I wanted to. For those who say the lack of character development was a positive for the film need to look at George's story line where the lack of emotional connection due to the unfocusedness(probably not a word) meant a lot of the short movie time that was meant to be for emotional connection didn't pay off, leaving less time for the other storylines to wrap up in a satisfying way. In my opinion this film doesn't deserve all of the praise it's getting which pains me as a part of the official church of Saint Nolan(praise be). Of course there were positives as well: Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography was incredible, the sound effects were amazing(despite some of the mixing), Tom Hardy's storyline and some surprisingly strong acting from Mr styles.

Dunkirk isn't just a 'great' movie. It's not just 'slightly better than the best movie you've seen in the last few years'.

It's *Chariots of Fire* level amazing. I am confident it will go down as one of the greatest films of the last 50 years and be the new benchmark, and a reference point, for film greatness for perhaps the next 50 years.

There isn't a single scene that goes on for too long or feels like filler, there's no unnecessary dialogue or long cliched personal stories about *'ere's my sweethear' back 'ome, look here's a picture, queue awkward dialogue about how they're sure 'they'll be home again soon' only to be shot through the back a few minutes later, falling to the ground in slow-motion picture still in hand'.*

Even with the scale of the situation, the boats, the machinery, everything still feels of a scale that's human, personal, tangible - you don't feel overwhelmed, it's done in a way that you can process it and care about each one of them.

dkiaznc,"Dunkirk blew my mind! It was the most exhilarating movie I remember watching. The visual cues, the time line and the narrative structure were brilliant. 

The booms of bombs and the flypast of spitfires shook my local IMAX's seats.

Some of the scenes were exceptionally shot, the artistic and wonderful direction takes the cake.

PS: 
Did someone else notice the character of Cillian Murphy on the small boat which refused to take in Tommy and Alex's character. He was shown in the boat, which went back to the mainland.

My guess is that this happened on the third or fourth day on the beach. Then Cillian's character was hitched onto the boat(Probably a day or two later) which was going back to the land,and which was shot down by a U-boat and thus Cillian Murphy was found on the boat by the moonstone. the events after that happened on the last day. Will someone help me figuring out and creating a time line of the events as it happened.

dkib5x6,"Some people complain about the timeline thing which is actually somethinf I LOVED. Seeing the sunken target practise boat from hardys perspective and 10 minutes later when harry styles climbed into a boat, realising its the same one was awesome. 
Also loved the sound mixing something people complain about aswell.

incredible movie",6ol0kp
dkibqdj,"Haven't seen him mentioned much but damn, Fionn Whitehead did one hell of a job. Knew Nolan casting an unknown for top billing wouldn't happen without good reason, but still want to give credit where it is due. Impressed with both Whitehead and Harry Styles as newcomers, hope to see more of them. What a film.",6ol0kp
dkibuds,"I watched it in Digital IMAX yesterday. 

Before my ""review"", I have a question: [Spoiler](/s ""do you guys think that Cillian Murphy's character figured out that the boy actually died? When they were unloading the body off the boat, his character was shown for pretty much just a second so I didn't get a good look at his reaction."")


THE GOOD:
- It's tense. Hanz Zimmer's soundtrack got me so wound up that I actually jumped up my seat at one point. There's a feeling of dread throughout the movie. 
- The aerial shots are absolutely beautiful. They make you stare and forget the movie for a moment.  
- Even with the short run time and lack of plot, the characters were easy to get attached to.  
- Harry Styles was fucking great. 


THE MEH:
- The first hour or so is a bit disjointed. You'll have to pay attention. I got confused and wondered if everything was being told in reverse or something, but it's just that a lot of the movie is one scene told through multiple perspectives (land, sea, air). 
- That, with the short run time made me feel a bit unsatisfied. I wanted more story, more plot, and more time to get to know the characters. 
- Maybe it's because I'm neither an American or a Brit, but I had a hard time making sense of what the characters were saying. I don't think the dialogue is that important though.
- This is just nitpick, I thought it was fairly obvious that [Spoiler](/s ""the French soldier stole the dead soldier's clothes, which made me think that Fionn Whitehead's character knew and just went with it. So my reaction when the confrontation with Harry Styles happened was ""why are they only bringing this up now?""."") The scene was absolutely intense though, and is probably my favorite part. 

Also, is it just me or does Jack Lowden (the pilot) look like a younger and more handsome Simon Pegg?

I wrote a lot more of the bad than the good, but I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Watching it in the cinema was an experience. Would watch again. 8/10. ",6ol0kp
dkicfrc,"The movie felt so much longer then it actually was because of the tension.


The movie did a great job at transmitting emotion with little to no words. When the planes were fighting I was at the edge of my seat, when the civilian boats came to the rescue I almost cried and when Tom Hardy got the last plane I was cheering alongside the soldiers.

Then the second hour hits you with one emotional gut punch after another. You'll want to cry but there's no goddam time because the war keeps going on and you're still trying to get out alive. And not everyone will.

A beautiful film about the triumph of the human spirit and the absolute devastation of war.",6ol0kp
dkicyug,Was Kenneth Branagh only in the movie so that they could zoom in on his face when something crazy was about to happen?,6ol0kp
dkidejx,"This was very fresh. 

Nolan does a lot of sci-fi stuff and complicated story ideas and tricky dialogue. The contrast of this makes it so nice among his collection. This is a powerful movie with a very human and realistic characters. The dialogue is really narrated in the mind of the viewer which is an incredible way to have a story told. 

Cillian Murphy is incredible. 

Also LULZ at people who said the guy walking in the beach was Tom Hardy when the trailer came out. People were saying ""he's got a distinct walk"" so confidently and it wasn't even him. ",6ol0kp

Also, along with everyone, that sound design was fucking intense plus some. Took me a second to get used to the volume but it was certainly effective, our theater was rumbling through out. 

One of my favorites from Nolan, will be interesting to watch again at some point. Also shout out to the glorious 70mm print I saw it on, drop dead gorgeous (and we got free hats when we walked out of the theater!!) Really thought it was something special, can't wait for Nolan's next film.",6ol0kp

Sorry if this is already answered in here, I didn't want to scroll through to avoid spoilers.",6ol0kp
dkividn,"Just got back from seeing it, and here are my observations (spoilers ahead):

1) I agree with certain reviews that this is not really a war film, rather should be see as a survival film - there are clear parallels between Dunkirk and the most recent Godzilla, for instance.

2) Hanz Zimmer's score kept me bottled up for the first hour, and then when the first Elgarian soar stuck up as the small ships appeared I felt my emotions release. I get the complains about the score, but personally I felt it balanced the tension of impending disaster with catharsis, much in the same way the War Horse score achieved

3) I am a Chris Nolan fan, and I would place this on par with TDK and Inception - each has their own unique take on an old trope, and Dunkirk manages to subvert the war story into a tale of survival. It was meditative on the subject of doing anything to get home, while also ensuring that the end huzzah was a reprieve rather than an absolution.

4) The cinematography was on another level. The IMAX cameras showcased the sea and beaches in ways that only Nolan seems to do in modern cinema, and the sea definitely seems to be where Nolan has his heart (Inception, DKR, Interstellar, Prestige all have water in pivotal scenes)

I definitely recommend it, and would suggest watching it in the biggest screen you can.",6ol0kp
dkiya9l,"Just got out of a 70mm showing. That was beautiful. The entire film was so beautifully stressful. I can't wait to see it in IMAX.

The cinematography was breathtaking and I'm actually now really upset I can't see it in 70mm IMAX.

But man, was that fantastic in ways I could never imagine. The shot of Hardy with his back to the camera and his plane on fire may be my favorite shot of the film.

And if I had a negative it was I just wasn't a fan of the shots that involved the side of the plane and the tail. I wasn't a fan in Interstellar either, but that's just a small nitpick.

Also, to the lady who took a minimum of ten Snapchats, with flash, during the climax of the film and then yelled ""that fucking sucked"" as the credits rolled, I hope you trip and crack your phone screen. 

And one more interesting thing, I always go to the same theater when I see movies on Friday morning. I see a lot of the same movie goers, the crowds I see usually don't clap, my 85% full theater erupted into applause at the end. It was strange because I never see that happened but dammit if there was a film to do it to Dunkirk was it.",6ol0kp
dkiyiep,"Great film. Spectacular aerial dogfighting - the camera angles and the actors were brilliant; as well as the aircraft of course. The characters were great as well, people keep forgetting this is not a movie following a specific group of people, like Saving Private Ryan. This is a movie about a lot of people, and the characters were designed so as to reflect that, and did not let the audience latch onto or even take a liking to them, as they were supposed to be representations of the average person who would have been there. And finally, people keep comparing it to Saving Private Ryan, which is apples to oranges really.",6ol0kp
dkiylku,"This is the 2nd Nolan film I've gotten to watch in true IMAX format throughout his filmography. It was worth it, along with trailers for Blade Runner 2049 and Justice League.

The Museum of Discovery and Science (Ft. Lauderdale, FL) converted to IMAX with Laser (The Force Awakens was the last IMAX 70mm played at that theater before renovations), it was still worth it to see the majority of the movie utilizing the entire screen. Especially with the opening scene.

Soundtrack was good as usual since its a Nolan + Zimmer collabration. I really liked that the movie was divided into 3 segments which interconnected at the end. Made it stood out from other war movies. I was pleasantly suprsied by Harry Style's acting.

Some negatives: I dont care if its meme or whatever but its a war movie it should have been R rated. Soldiers get shot/bombed at and they look like they went to sleep. 

Clunky dialogue by the navy commander + Over abundance of side shots of the planes during the dogfights. Just show the whole plane. He did this shit in interstellar too.

Overall a high 8.",6ol0kp

Few dialogues, everything goes with the staging. A lot of IMAX's sequences, with beautiful shots and strong esthetics. Zero problem with the comprehension of the movie. The editing and cutting are perfectly clear and relevant.  
Another key point, the music composed by Hans Zimmer. Nothing memorable but she serves completely the movie. I don't know who is the guy wich brought the ide aof the ""tic"" during all the movie, but accentuates a lot the tension.

The same enemy fight also missed the boat at sea due to the ingenuity of the Brits, which we would see with radar, dambusting, and cracking the enigma. 

The fight Hardy showed getting his plane landing gear down.  Then he burns the plane.  It was a loss, but the Jerrys did not gain anything either, due to the loss of the plane.  Symbolic of the Brits fighting spirit and of Dunkirk as a whole.

 Several times I fucking jumped out a my seat when bullets flew by as it was LOUD with the huge sound system, I cannot imagine what living with those bullets being real would have felt like, I got scared just being in the middle of a theater when bullets hit metal out of nowhere.

We see him in the rowboat that is returning to shore following the capsizing of the bigger boat - so when did he get back out to sea to be on another boat that is hit by a U-Boot? Is this something I should have just inferred happened?

It seemed like there were sequences where things were happening at the same time, but were obviously shot at different times. Whether it the lighting/colour balance, or the boat not being in the scene/background. Just seemed awkward to me.

Back to good things, can't think of any movie in recent memory that had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I was utterly engrossed, even if I couldn't understand the dialog. Love how nothing was predictable, none of the characters really disposable.

It threw me off a bit that some scenes had the black bars and were wider screen, while others took up the entire screen.

Really opened up all the aerial shots to really breathe and made the claustrophobic scenes way more chaotic with less to see.

dkvwefy,"I liked Dunkirk on the whole, there were many great moments of tension and plenty of extraordinary images. However, as somebody who has always felt ambiguous about Nolan, the usual doubts persisted. (The main one that DIDN'T was the cheesy dialogue, which was kept to a minimum here - as always with Nolan, the dialogue that was there was often inaudible.) NOTE: I know many Nolan fans post on here, this is just my perspective on why Dunkirk didn't entirely work FOR ME. Obviously the general reception to the movie has been rapturous, and that's fine.

I didn't think the three part structure (plus timejumps) worked. Not only did I find it confusing but I also thought it broke up and deflated tension on several occasions. There were moments of cheesiness which Nolan always has, tied in with the soundtrack, which was possibly my main issue with the movie.

I know many people love the soundtrack and I did think it was very effective in parts, but it's constant presence had a distancing effect. As immersive and in-the-midst of things as the camerawork was, the soundtrack broke that immersion (compare Saving Private Ryan's opening scene, e.g.). I just think the movie would have been MORE effective at points if it had been stripped of that soundtrack. The Elgar quoting music when the boats turned up I just found too on-the-nose. It was a straining for emotion that to me seemed unnecessary.

Ultimately, I think Nolan *is* an extraordinary director but I don't think I'll ever entirely love his movies, because he doesn't do subtlety. Everything is heightened by Zimmers thundering music and deliberately tricky plot mechanics. I don't think he's in the same league as Kubrick but I can see why the two are compared because Nolan, for all his ""emotional"" moments, seems to me to be more interested in style/structure  than in human character. That's why his movies always seem somehow artificial, even when they're made with in-camera effects, about real historical situations.

In spite of all these criticisms, I do think Dunkirk is worth seeing on IMAX 70MM if you can. It's a one of a kind movie, made by a auteur who has access to the sort of budgets auteurs can usually only dream of. And the drowning scenes are great.",6ol0kp

The majority of the film is really good, loved the dramatic opening of the two men trying desperately to get onto the ship carrying a wounded man. Gave you a real sense of the fear & hell that these people went through. 
The scene in the deck of the boat when Harry Styles' character almost forces the French solider to sacrifice himself was brilliant & so tense as the enemy began raining fire down upon them.
My complaint would be I was expecting a tad more action, having been unfamiliar with the events at Dunkirk I didn't know what to expect.

The choppy non-linear aspect reminded me of the fight scene in Interstellar, how it becomes really distracting and pushes you out of the film when it keeps cutting back to the kitchen on earth. It was also corny and phony feeling (Branaghs character and acting seemed selfconscious, Rylance explaining about spitfires when they'd have heard them all the time on the mainland?) The sense of scale felt really compromised by focussing on small vignettes but without adequate character development to pull that off. It was admirable from a photography point of view, but nowhere near as suspenseful or engaging as I was expecting. The Zimmer score was hugely distracting, I swear it used the Shepard Tone in places to manipulate a sense of tension. ",6ol0kp
dl46oyd,"I think saying that this movie has ""no story"" is pretty audacious. 

To me this film felt like an ""Event Study"" for lack of a better term. Nolan wanted you to feel the way these soldiers felt on the beach without being too emotionally tied to any of them. The lack of dialogue & time with each character were obvious choices and not a sign of lack of effort/talent. 

To call this film boring is even more audacious but sure...okay. 
If you were bored during this film I'm fairly confident Nolan movies aren't for you. 

Check out a more run-of-the-mill WWII movie like Hacksaw Ridge, which was clearly not for me. (I'm an atheist & don't like having christian values shoved down my throat by Mel Gibson.)

In terms of storytelling, I loved how Nolan didn't go into war film cliches. There was no Winston Churchill munching a cigar, no epic speeches to the troops or gory battle scenes. Just the story of men trying to get home and the heroes who made it possible. 

This is truly Nolan at his best- his instinct to have concurrent narratives and getting jiggy with timelines actually works perfectly here because the story is so compact. 

Also, if this doesn't win an Oscar for cinematography the Oscars are truly rigged beyond comprehension.

I like his movies, some of them a lot, but I never thought they were masterpieces. I think Dunkirk changed that. I'll have to watch it again in a few months to be sure.",6ol0kp

I saw Dunkirk with a group of my buddies who usually only watch the big summer blockbusters and they walked into Dunkirk, expecting a big spectacle movie because Nolan directed it. I ended up being the only person who loved it and all my friends absolutely hated it. Most of them said that it was boring and that they expected more from a Nolan movie. It was kind of a shock to me because one of my friends says he's a huge Nolan fan and the only conclusion he made from the movie was that he can't trust him anymore. I thought that even though it's a lot more grounded than his other movies, it provided enough action scenes to keep the movie exciting and that there were some insanely tense moments throughout the movie. The scene with the soldiers hiding in the grounded boat kept me at the edge of my seat. ",6ol0kp

dkigoal,"I saw this movie yesterday and was completely blown away by it. What an audiovisual treat. The music, the sound effects of guns, planes, the rumbling, holy shit. You know what this movie did? It made me afraid of guns. It made me afraid of a SINGLE plane. That's how effective this was. Nowadays its easy to get desensitized in movies and TV shows to violence because there's so much of it. Dunkirk managed to undo all that. You could feel the fear, the dread, the hopelessnes. And visually, easily Nolan's best work yet. The dogfighting scenes in particular were incredible.


I also enjoyed the storytelling style of the movie. I love how we barely learned what each character was called, and how they barely talked. It wasn't important. The movie was lean and focused. It didn't overstay its welcome. For what it set out to do, it did it perfectly.

dkigzbr,"Christopher Nolan is a director who puts a lot of thought into writing and directing his films. He's a visual storyteller who cares dearly about the narrative structure he painstakingly arranges on the screen while treating his audience with substantial intelligence. For years, he’s broken new ground in cinema by tackling complex concepts with multiple layers that unravel with repeat viewings. So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that ‘Dunkirk’ is another Nolan film that will reveal new aspects a second or even third time around.
At the outset, this story is relatively straightforward – almost 4 lakh allied soldiers are stranded on a beach, surrounded by land and being picked off slowly by air bombers. They need to be evacuated by sea, but there aren’t many ships to ferry them off. It’s an absolutely harrowing predicament to be in, and Nolan captures the fear, anxiety, strength and bravery of those involved in equal measure. He does not politicise or glorify the notion of war, instead choosing to portray it for what it is – a complex game of survival, with little room for heroics. What’s astounding is his ability to do so with minimal dialogue. Arguably, any of the actors could be easily replaced and the movie wouldn’t be hampered. Each soldier, officer, pilot, general and captain has his own significant role to play but in the absence of emotional pandering, the entire event itself turns into the lead character.
His decision to completely abstain from CGI, and opting for practical effects instead, makes every gunshot, explosion and dogfight feel extremely real and potent. This is further accentuated by an unnerving musical score by Hans Zimmer that only adds to the nonstop tension. These elements combine to make ‘Dunkirk’ a purely visceral experience, especially in IMAX. While it is not for the average moviegoer – if you’re looking for a fun and mindless action flick there are other options around – it is the first real contender for ‘Best Picture', and a number of other technical awards. If nothing else, it is yet another landmark achievement by one of the most important and skilled storytellers in the present generation of filmmaking.",6ol0kp

dkj36f6,"Anxiety: The Movie

I see quite a few people saying it was boring or overrated which is interesting to say the least. Apologies in advance for the text wall.


* I didn't realise how uncomfortable I felt watching people almost get trapped and die underwater. I think I have a fear of that and just seeing them getting so close was nerve-wracking. I'd also say there were so many tense moments that literally had me on the edge of my seat and I think that's the sign of a great film.
* The score was brilliant but honestly I find Zimmer always does a great job. With so little dialogue as well, the score becomes immensely important in carrying the film where it want you to go.
* I remember a post saying how loud it was but bloody hell it was **LOUD**. I saw it in IMAX which probably amplified things but you could really feel every bullet or bomb.
* I was worried about the lack of dialogue especially with parts where stuff could've been said but I later realised that it wasn't necessary as many shots were skilfully placed to say what wasn't. Actors did a great job with just their facial expressions or body language.
* I was seriously bummed out by George dying, it felt so unnecessary and the poor kid just wanted to help and ended up getting killed by a traumatised soldier.
* I wanted Cillian Murphy's character to die so much after that but then I realised he'd been trapped out at sea as the only survivor for a while, not only that but he'd also been fighting in the war and who knows what he experienced so you can't blame him for freaking out when they say they're going back there.
* I saw the French guy twist and the hardy ending coming a bit early. Ironically not speaking the language still got the dude killed as he didn't react in time. I was wondering why Farrier did not land  in the sea and try and get some help it's a shame he was captured in the end but he saved hundreds of thousands of lives in the end.

I'd be surprised if this movie doesn't get nominated for anything. I don't know about a Best Picture but sound mixing/editing surely. I know this movie won't be for everyone but I really enjoyed it and I felt it was masterfully told and paced. I especially loved the time differences between the air and land as that really threw me off initially. **9/10**",6ol0kp
dkjorgr,Better than DKR and Insomnia but otherwise it was my least favourite Nolan movie. Hans Zimmer didn't blow me away like i though he would and overall it wasn't as complex as the Nolan name is obligated to deliver. Visually stunning with masterful sound editing but I have to say I was a little disappointed.,6ol0kp
dkkgdwv,"Watched this twice today. The first one was more for really immersing myself in the story and the second was meant for simply enjoying the technicals—as it's such a beautifully striking film—but this made me appreciate the storytelling aspect even more. Things just made more sense and having those ""Aha!"" moments was glorious. 

If I could describe this film in one word, it would have to be... *visceral.* It did to me what Band of Brothers does every single time I see it—it drained me of my energy. It's as if I also fought for survival like them. It consumed me so much that it felt surreal to see people laughing and hear music playing the moment I got out of the theatre. 

Well done, Mr. Nolan and team. You guys are just so fucking talented.

P.S. I really thought Band of Brothers' Malarkey and the pilot Collins are played by the same actor. ",6ol0kp

dklq7ru,"I've heard some people say they were disappointed by Dunkirk, and that it is ""not like the other Nolan films"", but I LOVED it. And I liked how different it is from his other films. And I definitely praise Nolan for pulling this off. Again, the pairing of Nolan and Zimmer could not have been in more sync. The music, especially with that time ticking, had me on my toes the whole time. At the start, I felt like the three ""separate"" stories on land, sea and air were a little detached, but as the movie progressed, they were far from detached! Loved how the ending brought all three parts together. That convergence was my favourite part - it surprised me too!

I also heard that the movie is very much focused on the event itself, and one of the reasons my friends didn't like the movie as much as he did for Nolan's other films, is that it lacks character focus. Having watched the film with this in mind, I didn't find this to be a problem. Yes there wasn't one central character, but there were enough ""main"" characters, representing each of the sea, air and land, that I felt I could follow with enough emotions. Casting was done beautifully too. Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy and Kenneth Branagh were all fantastic. I also loved the performance by Jack Lowden. The one character I felt was a little meh was the one that is actually the cover of the movie posters, Tommy. I took liking to all other main characters introduced, but this one, I felt was just kind of ""there"".

Nolan made clear his purpose for the film, which was to focus on the event of Dunkirk itself, and that he did. I wished the film to be longer, just because I enjoyed it so much - but the length was perfect for Nolan's goals and purposes, so no complaints there.

Overall, loved the movie. ",6ol0kp

Dunkirk is a popcorn flick.  If only more popcorn flicks could be of this caliber!  
Despite its' flaws, Dunkirk (along with all of Nolan's films, really) is an experience in sensory immersion without resorting to throwing everything and the kitchen sink at the screen, crafted with passion and pure class, always respecting the intelligence of the audience, always a rare and refreshing beast to find in an ultra-high budget summer blockbuster.

dkrcwud,"I would've liked to see some scenes with German soldiers advancing. Not combat, but just seeing them moving towards the beach or the ever shrinking perimeter.

dks710v,"It's quite possibly the best war film I've seen to date and I've seen quite a lot. It tells a story by showing it to you rather than explaining everything. It doesn't rely graphic effects to shock you, but rather the ominous sounds of war, or the meaningless of death at times during it. It was fantastic. I can't find a flaw. It was beautiful and stunning and just incredibly moving.",6ol0kp
dkt0rul,"While the film is fantastic on a technical level and I thoroughly enjoyed it, the ending really took me out of the overall experience. 

For almost the entirety of the movie we're immersed in a story of survival. Then in the last five minutes or so the film seemingly tries to pivot to heroism, pride, and success within failure (the failure of being forced to evacuate, but doing an astonishing job of it). Exemplifying this is the fact that we go from a film with very little dialogue, to voiceover narration of Tommy reading Churchill's speech. 

Yes, the film has moments of heroism (Frenchman opening the hatch of the sinking boat, Hardy turning around to take out the bomber, Rylance and the boys heading to Dunkirk, etc.), but the film's *tone* doesn't emphasize the acts. So when the tone does shift at the end, I felt it was jarring, like the ending was incongruous with the rest of the film. To me it felt like Nolan couldn't think of how to end the film in a way that was true to its form, so he inserted a stock national pride ending.",6ol0kp

- I loved the opening scene! It is very distinct from the rest of the movie.

- Holy shit, the sounds from the explosions and gunfire was incredible (VERY loud, loudest movie I've ever watched probably). This is definitely a movie you have to see in theatres for the best experience.

- Like others have said, it is not a character driven movie at all. I can't name a single character in the movie...except Tommy, maybe? While this is a negative for some I actually thought it was pretty neat. I think it is meant to keep you focused on the event as a whole, rather than the individual soldier, since the experience would have been different for all that were there.

- Really an interesting movie. I feel like I have to watch it again to form a final opinion, but I would say it is definitely somewhere in the range of ""good - great"".",6ol0kp

dkn4r3x,"I can't say I liked *Dunkirk.*

It's nice visually, but that's it. Even though cutting between different plot lines is nothing new, here it felt disjointed and barely coherent - there doesn't seem to be much of a plot here. I'm not fussy about character development, but here there is next to no *characterisation* or fleshing out of characters, so I don't get invested or attached or even *interested* in any of the characters. I couldn't even *name* any of them save for George, the boy.

I'm guessing that Nolan wanted the Germans to be a nameless, faceless threat, because you hardly see any of them. Interesting that the opening 'crawl' said ""the enemy"" instead of ""Nazi Germany"" or ""the German Army"".

Zimmer's score felt almost uncomfortably overbearing at times, which I'm guessing is deliberate. In spite of that, I wasn't really 'getting' any changes in mood; I wasn't really feeling what I'm guessing is meant to be tension when, for instance, the Luftwaffe perform bombing runs on the beach.

dkkscpd,"I saw the movie yesterday (IMAX).  I agree with the comments on here so far.  There were 330,000 men evacuated in 1940 and the ""movie beach"" had nowhere near that many on it.  Looking at documentaries and witness accounts of the event, the beaches were black when seen from the sea.  Black because of the sheer amount of soldiers filled every space.  They ""bled"" into the sea as soldiers had to stand neck deep in the ocean to reach the boats (before they used the mole).  

In the movie the amount of civilian boats that came to collect the soldiers was a handful.  It didn't show the astronomical amount of help that was needed to transport over 300,000 soldiers back to England.

On the beach there was basically no food and barely any water.  People hadn't eaten for days and were weak.  It was pretty grim.  Also, speaking of grim, the beach would have had body parts everywhere not just neatly lined up dead soldiers.  

Totally agree that the pilot would have parachuted out of the plane rather than landing in enemy territory.  I thought he was going to fly into the German plane, glad he didn't as that would have been too Hollywood.

The toll the French played was present in the movie but they did a fantastic job of defending the area and held off the Germans so the Allies could evacuate.  Lots were left behind and were captured or killed.  This sacrifice was not elaborated on.

Finally, I found the way the soldiers all looked dejected and sad at the end was wrong.  Footage from those days show soldiers that were elated, cheering, grabbing sandwiches with gusto and being generally happy to be alive.

All in all, a decent movie but I think the true feelings around that event were lost and/or were not capitalized upon.  It's a shame because that is the real story.  One part that did put me in that moment was the sound of the Stukas as they approached.  That must have been terrifying.",6ol0kp

dkkvo0k,"A solid movie I'd say, though my expectations were higher for Nolan. But if you judge the movie on its own, I don't think there's too much wrong with it.

The soundtrack was a bit flat. It kept the tension up, which is something, but I expected it to be more powerful and dramatic. 

Some people seem have found the structure a bit confusing, which I didn't really experience. I think having the few intersecting moments really helped with understanding the timeframe.

Didn't really feel much connection with the characters, with the exception of Mr. Dawson's party. But I think that's acceptable with a movie that's based on real events. The characters are more of a narrational tool, with each character offering their own perspective on the events. 

I also expected there to be at least a few infantry fights in the town. Maybe they just wanted the enemy to seem more faceless, but I feel like it would have increased the sense of impeding doom a lot if they actually showed some fighting, and the approaching forces.

A few scenes seemed to have some varying colors between different shots, which was a bit distracting. There's one shot with a lot of bright blue sky and ocean, and then suddenly the next one seems a lot more gray and colourless.",6ol0kp

Minutes later, he shoots down the fighter on its strafing run while very obviously not on its tail, from a near impossible angle, after somehow completing a 180 degree turn on a dead engine without losing speed or appreciable altitude... sure. Sure.

But the most egregious offense to me was the repeated use of almost 80's action movie trope -esque establishing shots, showing a bomber in a spot where they are mere moments away from dropping their bombs and really ruining some folks' day, and then somehow it turns out that the good guys actually have 5 minutes of within-their-timeline time to swoop in and intercept.

I'm being critical primarily because elsewhere, there was *such* attention to detail. But, for one of the movie's three plotlines to revolve around air combat and handle it relatively sloppily... it was just consistently immersion breaking for me. One of the movie's biggest moments - the helpless dread of the fighter screaming in on its strafing run, only to be knocked out of the sky at the last minute by a plane that, when last shown *in this very timeline*, had run out of the speed, altitude, and power needed to do anything but choose between a beach landing or ditch?

dkqs0e0,"Just saw it last night and have been reading through comments and apparently the Movie was an empathy test.  Basically the most cited criticism is that ""there was no character development so i couldn't invest in any of the characters"" but the reality is YOU are supposed to be the character.  every scene was basically first person without the shaky camera gimmick.  You weren't supposed to emotionally invest in character you were supposed to be on the beach trying to escape, on a boat going to save your country men, or in the air trying to relieve brothers from the dive bombers.  Maybe if one of the characters was a man just waiting on the beach there would have been some dialogue but Nolan was trying to (and quite successfully IMO) put you **in** the story of someone trying anything to get home or someone trying to do his duty to get others home, or someone trying to do what he has to protect those trying to get home.


If you couldn't connect without the ""character development""  my guess is that although you dont have trouble with sympathy, empathy is much more difficult for you.",6ol0kp

Dunkirk, like most of his films lacks solid structure and start very slowly.  I know this movie is supposed to be ""different"" than other war movies and although it is, I left unsatisfied.  Act III was great, I will give him that but by the time we arrive I have no emotional attachment to the characters for carthasis.  

As a History channel stand alone movie depicting war, 10/10.  As a cinematic experience where I'm paying $16 to see, not worth it.

dkoulo9,"Technically it's shot beautifully and the music is outstanding. It's tense, and the constant challenges the men have to overcome are immense.

However, there are problems. The first and biggest being the almost complete lack of characterization. I can't remember anyone's name and it was hard to get attached to individuals.  I'm not asking for cheesy backstories or the tried and tested ""I've a gal waiting for me back home, sir"", but other than Cillian Murphy's character I didn't find anyone that interesting, thus found it hard to care. 

Secondly, the separate timelines; it seemed totally unnecessary.  I actually didn't realize what Nolan was doing until quite a way into the movie.  It threw me off, honestly.  

Thirdly, Harry Styles. Why he's in this I don't know. Not that he's bad, he's quite good, but he's a massive distraction. I couldn't get past his real life persona and accept him in his role. He sticks out like a sore thumb.

Mostly though, it's a well made realistic account of Dunkirk. It avoids any and all cliches and it never devolves into pointless action for the sake of it.

I mean just like they didn't know anything about eachother, we didn't either. I believe it was done that way on purposes and I enjoyed that. Also because there wasn't much dialogue you were bound to be much more aware of the music and to be frank, this is classic zimmer soundtrack but some people might have not liked it only because that was what they were hearing more than the dialogue itself. But overall I think this movie is a masterpiece. There isn't another war film like this for those very reasons. It was in the moment and the tension never left them and the audience either.

dl2iwzw,"I love Nolan, he’s never made a movie I haven’t loved, until Dunkirk.
 
He took every one of his directing techniques, which are normally awesome, and drew out each one to boredom or predictability or unrealism. 
 
Spoon feeding plot info?  Check: double close up of a closing door; I get it, the friend didn’t make it in.  Triple close up of life vests; I get it; they’re off to save people.
Disguising, or complete lack of, dialogue?  Check: countless drawn out close ups of supporting characters faces showing emotion while dramatic music rises; I get it, I should be scared now. 
Anxious moment stretched out for the sake of drama?  Check: How long did it take to land that engineless plane?  Did anyone really think the second pilot was not going to get rescued by the life vest boat?
 
I think these techniques are pulled off masterfully in his past work, but in this movie without a complex plot to keep things progressing, they seem bland and overdone.  Everything seemed extremely predictable: counting fuel now, someone runs out of it later.  Young boy hopes to be a hero in paper now, ends up hero in paper later (with spoon fed visuals of the newspaper pictures and newspaper headlines, drawn out close-ups of characters faces showing approval while satisfying music fades; I get it, I should be emotional now).

dkjhiwh,"After Inception and Interstellar, Nolan has made a film rooted mostly in reality. This change might go down well with everyone. A film about war stripped off politics and that is concerned mainly about the soldiers themselves. The way each the three timelines are weaved together, the consistency of storyline whether viewed in first person or otherwise (the very fact that you can even do that in the first place) and finally the way they all come together as one is simply put beautiful. There are still things I think I don't fully understand. I'm currently trying to recall it frame by frame hoping to come across something I must have overlooked.  Watching it again is..

Edit: To be honest though as the credits were rolling I felt as if there was something missing. I don't how to put this. It seemed as if there was this void and I couldn't immediately come terms with fact that that it had come to an end.

dkjpvc6,"Brilliant film. Best war movie I have personally seen. Sound design is a big win on this and I highly recommend the IMAX version if your interested in viewing.

Now that I've gushed I will say the thing i'm most impressed by is how the movie keeps its focus on the whole as opposed to the individuals. We see individuals but I wouldn't even be able to tell you their names. Most war movies feel like they force a bit of ""follow this one hero"" but with a subject matter like Dunkirk (a retreat) it shows how a country can try and make the best out of a disaster. 

Also no expositional dialog. There was probably less that 100 lines of dialog the whole film. I feel like other directors would have ham-fisted the numbers of soldiers or overblown the number of ships. Nolan does this as minimalist as possible while keeping the tension up to 11. 

Lastly.... HANS ZIMMER! The score is the most anxious I've heard which I feel made the movie top notch.",6ol0kp

* That France looks too much like 2016, not 1940.

* The weather conditions (that are supposed to be within the same hour like during the plane scenes, I understand that there are three storylines that are not exactly linear) are not consistent at all.

* The destroyers are French, not British.

I guess that's the limitations of refusing to work with CGI.

dks3nuy,"A truly unique experience. 

I was lucky enough to see this today in 70mm IMAX. 

The production value, the sound mixing, score, cinematography, and editing were breathtaking from start to finish. Oscar nominations expected across the board.

I did notice though, that the 16:9 shots seems to be considerably darker than the full 70mm shot. Did anyone else notice this? 

I was half expecting to notice the black bars coming and going, and I did (I'm a very critical film viewer) but the change in picture quality and particularity the lower exposure I found quite jarring.

I also really felt the PG-13 rating, particularly on the beach as the bombs were dropping and bodies were falling to the ground, unscathed, and then laying on the sand looking like they were napping as the soldiers walked past.

The film was at its best in the air, during the dogfights that had me pinned to my seat, and in the claustrophobic water as the soldiers were bombed again and again, struggling to escape the sinking ships. 

I thought the performances were solid all around, I certainly don't think the movie deserves what criticism it has received for a lack of narrative and character development. It's fairly obvious that Nolan's priority was the sights and sounds and overall feeling of the evacuation, not the reason for it or the world outside that stretch of beach.

All in all an incredible film experience. If you have the opportunity to see it in IMAX, particularly 70mm, you owe it to yourself and everyone involved in its production to do so!

Other than that I thought this was an incredible film. I've always been something of a Nolan detractor. Not that I didn't think he was great, just that he wasn't that great and didn't belong in the discussion of best working directors. This movie changed my mind on all that. It was masterfully done.",6ol0kp

Beautiful. There were so many moments where I found myself in awe just at the blues of the water. 

The portrayal of the enemy was haunting. [Not seeing a single German soldier's face; it felt so impersonal.](#spoiler)

Incredible portrayals of conflict: [The Movie](#spoiler).

My only complaint is I personally dislike Hans Zimmer's style. I find his choices tend to contrast mine. I often can't help but notice his music not doing anything for me. However, there were only two instances of this occurring; [the first being when the civilian ships arrive at the beach, and](#spoiler) the second of which I'm having trouble remembering the details of. Quite sure it happened twice though. So (admittedly begrudgingly) good work.",6ol0kp

dl2eia5,"Pure brilliance. Beautifully scored, stunningly shot. Nolan (with the help of Zimmer) turned the tension up to 11 in the opening minute and held it there for pretty much the rest of the film. The three converging timelines, while a tad confusing, was a very clever method of storytelling; moments such as the contrast between a cool, reassuring Cillian Murphy following the torpedoeing, and the shellshocked wreck that Rylance fishes out of the water, were hugely effective.

I also appreciated the way the film addressed the fact that Dunkirk was a colossal defeat in many ways, but in itself a tremendous victory, somehow. ""All we did was survive!"" to which the old man replies, ""That's enough.""",6ol0kp
ds7zc1r,"This was one of the weirdest movie experiences in a long time.

If I had not known, I would have said this was a first time director. The score was all over the place and ridiculous at times; the acting unconvincing, and every scene overly drawn out like it was a directors cut (even then I don't remember a directors cut that comes close to this). It all ends up being melodramatic and contrived.

dkxlrqa,"So im kind of late to the party here but heres my personal review. The movie focuses a lot on sound. By God, the sound was crazy. The divebombs, the gunshots, the score itself, noise and visuals drove this movie. There are some undeniably beautiful shots in this movie, especially the plane scenes. The actors did great, Bravo to Styles on his performance, and Tom Hardy for being the hero at the end. Now heres where I get picky. This movie lacked narrative and character. It never really characterized the cast or even more importantly, it never made us empathize with the characters. Why do I care about these guys? Do they have families? Whats their story to getting back home? See in the traditional war movie, the plot focuses on the characters driving it. In Saving Private Ryan, we follow the characters on their journey, we empathize with them. This movie, for sure, isnt a traditional war movie, and focuses largely on the event. So should i/we judge the movie on characters and plot for this very reason? Thats its a dramatization of the Miracle of Dunkirk? Im not sure and i still struggle to put cinematography and historical dramatization apart. One thing I Do love about this movie is the threat of an invisible enemy. We know the Germans are there, but we never see a German till the very end. Even in the planes, we can't see the German Pilot himself. Not story nor characters drive this movie, only the haunting score than never stops, along side the constant ticking, and the never ending fear of an invisible enemy is what drives Dunkirk.

P.S. personally i think its a good movie, with slow pacing. But no, its not a masterpiece, and definitely lacks compared to Nolan's other arts of cinema. ",6ol0kp

Everyone seems to be praising the score but I found it more annoying than an actual source of tension. To me, the scenes would have been more powerful if there were no score and just the real sounds of war. The orchestra was overdone and unnecessary. 
And how many edge of the seat moments can one person take? That, combined with the obnoxious music just left me asking 'why?' throughout the film, rather than suspending my disbelief.

The acting is sharp but it blends in with the practical effects, sweeping camera shots and tense soundtrack. I really wish that Nolan had gone 100% with IMAX shots, the ~10% or so on traditional film is jarring in both aspect ratio change and the muted colours/lower definition compared to the IMAX format.

I know that this was a complex film to shoot but couldn't they fix many of these things in post? With CGI? Especially in a film with this budget.

There was a simple, close-up dialogue scene with two of the officers where one's face had an orange glow and a clear shadow from the sun and the other's face had this completely flat look with zero shadows. And then the many dogfighting scenes where it cuts between daylight, sunset and cloudy weather literally seconds apart. AND that one part where one of the officers is walking down the beach, looking out at the water and it cuts between, what looked like, scenes that were shot in the morning and then in full daylight.

And there were many, many more.

It was so clear that it pulled me completely out of the movie at several points. I've never experienced anything similar in a movie shown in the cinema - and again, especially with this kind of a budget.

I might be nitpicking and I think most people won't ever notice these things, but this took at least half a star for me if I were to rate it. ",6ol0kp
dkicphn,I really like how the movie illustrated how fucked up life can be. Harry styles character along with the other kid had so many brushes with death and somehow make it out. Then poor George passes in the most unexpected way by simply trying to help. Tragic ,6ol0kp
dkicq2u,"It was a heavy movie to watch. I'm currently reading a Remarque book about coming back from war so it probably hit me twice as hard. We need movies like this: not about the heroes, not about achievements and honor, not about glories of war, but the opposite - about how incredibly ugly it is. People just... Die and no one can do anything about it, even pay them respects or ask for their names. The sheer terror of counting minutes and knowing you can die at any moment just like that. 

People will probably say this movie is boring and not a lot happens, but it's not about that, it's about the never ending suspense and it excels at it. You fear, you wait, you sit on the edge of your sit watching this unfold and you cry not when someone dies but when you see the boats finally arriving. I never thought I'd be so relieved to see some boats. Also I see people saying they don't a character to root for, to bound with, but I think that's exactly the point — it's not about 'a' man, but about *men* as a whole, about the tragedy and the event of Dunkirk.

It's a weird movie by action standards (well its obviously not an action at all) and even by Nolan standards, and I love it. We need movies like this to remind us how horrible a war really is and how lucky we are to never witness it. 

I also like that this movie is 80% sound and music, you can probably watch it with your eyes closed and still get the emotions it's trying to force on you. The sound design and music is so great I advise everyone to see it in imax. The sounds of plane approaching, it's vulturesque screeching and deafening roar are still with me hours later and I don't want to imagine how eerie, frightening and eardrum-shattering it really was. The music makes your heart race in the rhythms of the engines and machineguns or just sit there trying to figure out why do you feel so empty and uneasy. Sound and music makes this film what it is for me.

Also it was one of the rare movies where after the credits started rolling no one just got up and left, the whole theater was sitting there for a couple of minutes silently staring in front of them. Not often do I see that. It leaves a mark (I hope) and people feel it.

I thought that the coming home stuff was really well done and in taste and it's acknowledged that it was a complete military shit show, of no fault of the boots on the ground.  The final 2 second shot was also great and very humanising.

The thing I think set the tension the most beyond the music/sound was the fact that we never saw the enemy, sure we saw the machines and the bullets but we never saw a pilot or a soldier. We saw the devices of war and the unknown of what was around the corner, under the sea or behind a sand dune. The fact that we only saw the movies ""heroes"" and the enemy remained hidden in scenery or machine only added to the enormity of the situation 

",6ol0kp
dkjxb2s,"This was an excellent movie, with only a few nagging points. The score was intense but pervasive...I get that Nolan and Zimmer wanted to maintain suspense but it did get annoying at times. Also, like Interstellar, the sound mixing blew out half the dialogue making conversations indecipherable. I also didn't think the editing needed to be disjointed...it felt more than a bit gimmicky. How long does Hardy's plane actually take to glide to a landing?? 

But these issues aside, Dunkirk is an amazing film to watch on the big screen. I was lucky to catch a 70mm show too...definitely worth it. From the first minute until the last, the suspense and intensity doesn't let up. It's also refreshing to see REAL extras, boats and planes being used instead of CGI. It gives the film another layer of tangibility that gets taken for granted with most other big-budget studio films. Christopher Nolan deserves an Oscar nomination for his work here.

dki8ihe,"It was well shot, it had great moments of awe and the sound design was fantastic. 

I was excited for Nolan's next movie, and as someone who learned the story of Dunkirk as a little boy, I couldn't contain my excitement for this film. 

So you can imagine my heartbreak when I realized during the move that I really didn't like it. 

My criticism is that Nolan (while having moments of excellence) undermines his most powerful moments and, and his classic use of time comes off as 'Too clever for its own good', and I say that as someone who adored Inception and Insterstella as I was watching them. The split timelines were used to show the different perspectives, (which is nice) and there were a couple of moments of excellent subversion (the waving pilot), but it seemed to be used to draw out the moments of drama over a much longer timespan than necessary. In the case of the drowned pilot, we'd already seen that the Riverboat was coming to save him, and we were shown him struggling over a period of 15min, while the other sequences were used to interrupt. The scene would have been more powerful as a single unbroken scene, and the timelines just made it more frustrating. 

I understand that the movie wouldn't have been served by cheesy dialogue or exposition, but I struggle to care about characters I can't name. Harry Stiles acting was fine, but without a character to play he was just 'Harry Stiles'. When Harry was in danger, my mind would just call him ""Harry from one direction"" and remind me that it's just a movie. If their character had died, I wouldn't have missed them, because I knew ""Harry Stiles the actor"" would be fine. (The same can be said for Cillian Murphey and Tom Hardy. Without names, they're just actors, and actors will be fine). It's the characters I care about in movies like that, because characters can suffer. Actors just get paid. 

The ship sinking sequences were well done, but by the time the 3rd ship sinks the effect is severely weakened. The boy refusing to go below deck and opening the hatch was excellent, but the sequence had lost its punch after that. Nolan got all the fear and awe and terror right with the first two sinking sequences, after that I simply felt like I'd seen it before. 

For a Nolan film, there were moments that felt frustratingly obvious.
 The Captain's son locks Murphy in the ship for no reason, after a dramatic staring contest with the lock. Then he doesn't let him out. Then his father says to let him out, and he STILL doesn't let him out. Then he opens the door and Murphey's escaped. 
Why? How did any of that serve the plot?

When he does escape, George gets killed. Why? What does that prove? It's sad at first, but it's meaningless. He fell down some stairs. It wasn't because the soldier was so desperate to escape that he killed George in a panic, and George wasn't killed by a Stuka while doing something heroic. I thought it was nice that his mate put him in the paper, but even that feels like it undermines the real life civilians who died at Dunkirk being shot at over 6 days by the Luftwaffe. George died pointlessly to teach us what? Do people die in war? 
To capitalize on this pointlessness, the Son lies to the soldier ""He'll be fine"", which is then undermined when the soldier sees his body. 

The final subplot about them being hated on their return to England lasts about 5 minutes so that Nolan can have his ""You're actually loved"" moment, but that felt so pointless and unnecessary when the movie's resolution could have been ""We made it home"".  It's the moment of Triumph, but the movie undercuts itself with this subplot and weakens its own emotional weight because of it. 

The flying sequences are well done, but Tom Hardy appears to give up his life/freedom to save that minesweeper (which is great and heroic and a good cinematic moment), runs out of fuel (which is another great moment as he soars over the beach in silence) THEN takes out another Stuka that we've been taught throughout the movie is extremely difficult, AND manages to pump his landing gear down at the last second so that he can land on sand, which he does flawlessly. Nolan was setting us up for a heroic sacrifice (I expected him to kamikaze his plane into the bomber) and he subverted that expectation (which is fine), but then pulls out the bullshit magic of shooting down another plan and landing perfectly. The lack of realism in those final few moments felt like finding out a magic trick was CGI. 

Yet for me, the final and biggest let down about this movie was that Nolan took a clear cut and heroic story of a true life miracle, and undercut it to suit his own unconventional style. The first minutes establish that the Navy is commandeering the River cruises. The Rear Admiral tells us that they're coming. Yet we've seen our Old man captain run from them (why?) to go to Dunkirk. 

A celebrated part of the Dunkirk legend is that the civilians risked their lives to bring home their dying soldiers. The movie confuses this by pretending it was a single ship running away from the nazy, by a captain who hasn't been asked. When the little ships do get to Dunkirk, they turn up covered in civilians and under minimal enemy fire, and they get the job done in what appears to be a single afternoon, undermining the miracle of the real event, and discrediting those who risked their lives to bring back their soldiers. 

Dunkirk was a disappointment. I won't argue that it looked great, and had good (Zac Snyder) moments, but it wasted an opportunity to tell a legend that few outside of England seem to know about, and it spent all it's money on identical boats sinking repeatedly. There was a list of unnecessary subplots (Death of George/French guy spy in boat/we'll be hated at home/Running from the Navy), the moments of Peril were either repetitive or drawn out far too long, and the lack of physics/historical realism didn't make up for it. The choice of using actors rather than characters would have worked if he'd exclusively used people we'd never heard of, instead of people we like. The story structure never came together (like it does in other films) but instead just seemed to confuse the story.

Chris can do heart. Interstellar is carried by it. He can do multi-level story telling. Inception excelled at it. He can do set-pieces (The Dark Knight) and scale (Rises). This movie didn't do any of those nearly as well as his previous films. I didn't even notice the score (which is a shame because I did in inception/interstellar). People say that this is Chris Nolan's best piece, but in my honest and meaningless opinion, this movie was nothing but awe, and that wasn't enough after about 20minutes.  ",6ol0kp
dki9fg5,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director. 

I got to the theater 4 hours ahead of time, I was first in line. 

I am disappointed. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think those who will give this film its highest ratings are the British. Understandably so. However, for the rest of the world, I feel like the climax scenes, the boats showing up to save all the soldiers, the captain asking boats which towns they were from, it all was familiar for the British. It had 100x more ""weight"" during those scenes for British viewers than others. 

I could not understand half the dialogue, was this just me??
I got about 10 words during the airplane scenes, and then about 50% during the rest, and I was trying hard to understand it all. 

Another Nolan-esque move was the aspect ratio changes during the whole movie, not sure if he did this to slightly tell audiences that the timeframe was different, or maybe because I saw it in IMAX it was formatted differently. 

Also let's just talk about the 3 story films Nolan has an incredible nack for. For those of us that follow his work, these are apparent in all of his films. So apparent, that during this movie I was looking out for it, and during the beginning when the film showed us one week, one day, and one hour, I had a framework for what was yet to come. Possibly this is why I didn't enjoy the movie as much as others, because I was looking for the connections in every scene to the next time frame. 


The worst part. 

I didn't really ""FEEL"" anything. 

There's one thing I know. Every Christopher Nolan movie I've seen I have FELT. I have felt some sort of emotion and during this movie I just. Didn't. 

For my final words I will say this, Christopher Nolan has done possibly the best a director can do with a true story. However, after seeing this movie I believe his true strength lies in his own imagination. Creating fictional stories from thin air that can lead whenever he wants them to, that has a twist the audience could never ever see coming. 



Let me know what you think. I'm listening. ",6ol0kp
dkk7tcm,"I just got out of this movie and have very mixed feelings about it. [SPOILERS PROBABLY]

I feel like Nolan was trying to convey certain feelings about war and Dunkirk, and I believe he did so very well.  
- He really conveyed how trapped and helpless the soldiers at Dunkirk felt (which I think was one of the film's biggest accomplishments).  
- He did a great job at not glorifying war and portraying the perspective of the British soldiers (I like how he never showed the German's perspective because it was a perspective that the British soldiers would never see).  
- I believe that the lack of character development was to convey the same sense of distance between the audience and the characters as the soldiers felt towards each other (In the sense that not many of the soldiers would know the in depth back stories of people they just met).  
- He did a good job at showing the mental toll that these experiences took on the soldiers (Cillian's character) and that they had consequences outside of directly fighting the Germans.  

Through all of these things, Nolan was able to convey how the soldiers at Dunkirk experienced the event, which is an amazing accomplishment; however, I don't believe all of these things came together to produce a particularly good movie.  

The movie was ""good"", but that is the extent of my feelings; they simply end at ""good"".  This does not include my appreciation for the things that I listed above, it is just my gut review about the experience.  I do think, however, that this says something about what Nolan was trying to get the audience to feel about the event.  Nolan touched on this at the end of the movie, but after Dunkirk, the British did not feel particularly great.  Sure they had successfully evacuated over 300,000 soldiers (which was far more than they could have ever dreamed of rescuing), but they had still suffered a huge military catastrophe.  So, as great as they could feel about the evacuation, it was very melancholy and lackluster.  This is exactly the tone and gut feeling that the film left me with, and it is something that I believe Nolan was purposefully trying to do. 

The film's biggest failure for me was the completely superfluous timeline switching.  In my opinion, it didn't really add all that much to the film and ended up confusing me on more than one occasion.  I had to ask myself more than once if it was the same boat sinking or a new one.  

I've said a lot, and now it's 2 a.m.  I'm curious to see how I feel about it in the morning.  Goodnight.",6ol0kp
dkoqsbu,"A technically well crafted movie to be sure, but the fact that I didn't know a single thing about any of the characters caused me to be much less invested in the action scenes than I could have been.  I really wish Nolan would invest as much time into developing people we care to connect with as he does in putting together exciting set pieces.",6ol0kp
dkig7iy,"I'm going to have the controversial opinion here. I didn't like it. Granted, I'm willing to give it a second chance and I'll be seeing it again probably in the next few days, and maybe my opinion will change. But here's my review:

Going in, I didn't know anything about the real story of Dunkirk. I wish I had, because frankly I was pretty lost on the story for a lot of the movie. Nolan has a very distinct editing style in his films where he likes to cut between different subplots and use music to drive the tension that seems to be rising at an equal rate between each of the plots. This is especially apparent in The Dark Knight and Inception. Here's the thing with tension though. For it to be really effective, it has to have a climax and then a release. You have to know how long to hold your audience at the edge of their seat before they want to slouch back. That's why most films try to [follow Freytag's pyramid to a T.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Freytags_pyramid.svg/250px-Freytags_pyramid.svg.png)

My biggest issue with Dunkirk is that not that it's *too* tense, but rather than its intended tension loses effectiveness over the course of the film because there is no breakage from it. Even a thriller or horror film has to have it's moments of build and release, and needs to keep building that tension until the climax. If your climax is so close to the tension you are building all the way up to it, it doesn't have the same effect, and the movie as a whole loses its bite. In opposition to Freytag's pyramid, Dunkirk's pyramid looked more like this: http://imgur.com/a/ahWNh

The Dark Knight works so well as a thriller and keeps you on the edge of your seat because the Joker is not in every scene, and that creeping violin music every time something bad is going to happen doesn't play for the entirety of the film's 152 minute runtime. That's no knock to Hans Zimmer--once again he did an incredible job with the score for Dunkirk, but it starts to lose its effectiveness over time to drive the tension of each scene. 

Before I list my other issues with the film, I'll briefly say what I loved about Dunkirk. Obviously, it's a very beautifully shot film. Just about no one gets those large grandiose wide shots in quite like Nolan does, and they're all the better in IMAX. The dull, greyish coloration to the film, especially on the beach shots really helps to capture the *feel* of being in a hopeless war zone. You do get the feeling overall watching the movie that you are right there along with these characters suffering with them as they are attacked everywhere they go. And as I previously stated, Zimmer does a tremendous job with the score, and the addition of the constant, steady ticking throughout much of the film is a great motif to represent both the characters' and audiences' respective anxieties. It's not Hans' fault that the scoring was more than a little overused--he did a very effective job.

Notice how I keep saying ""the characters"" instead of their names. That's because I don't know a single character's name in this movie. There are movies where, to an extent, this can be effective, intentionally leaving certain lead characters nameless for a variety of reasons (like Ryan Gosling in ""Drive"", Edward Norton in ""Fight Club, the entire cast of ""12 Angry Men""), but these are typically much more intimate stories with more time to get to know these characters. In Dunkirk, there is so much happening and so many different people or groups of people being cut to that we don't really get to know any of them. Seriously, it's a task to follow any of their stories for a good chunk of the movie because of how many edits are happening and how little dialogue takes place. You could argue that the purpose of this was to show that in war, individuals don't really matter or that personal relationships can't really be built, but I think you could make a pretty strong argument against that as well. I mean sure, if that's Chris Nolan's creative vision, I can't call bullshit on that because that's his art, but at this point I don't know what he was going for there yet. 

Lastly--and I made this point in another comment so I'll just copy and paste what I wrote here--I had an issue with the sound. I heard some weird dialogue mixing issues, and not even just in terms of balance with the music, which was likely intentional considering he stated that it was with Interstellar. There were two distinct times when the Commander was speaking on the bridge where his dialogue picks up too much background noise and it's not properly faded in and out. Very jarring to me as a sound designer but others may not have noticed as it may have been subtle enough to the average listener. Considering how mumbled and difficult most of the dialogue was to understand, it made me think that Nolan chose to use ADR in as few scenes as possible for a more natural feel to the film, but to me it really took away from the film experience. At least in Interstellar you can pretty easily follow along with the story so when the music overpowers the dialogue you're not missing out on anything crucial. I was often confused on what exactly was happening because of how the dialogue was edited in Dunkirk. If that was Nolan's intention, kind of an odd creative choice but okay. If it was the dialogue editor or rerecording mixer's fault, that's inexcusable.

So that's my review, take it as you will. Like I said, I'll be seeing it again, so it's very possible that certain aspects of my opinion on the film will change. It's also very possible that they won't and I'll just be the sourpuss who doesn't like Dunkirk.  ",6ol0kp

Absolutely beautiful in terms of visual and audio appeal. The gunfire and airplanes sounded so lifelike in Imax. My god, it was amazing.

I just couldn't latch onto the storyline. I didn't think there was enough individual character development, and I found myself not quite caring who lived or died (with the exception of that last airplane pilot).

Visually its a perfect 5/5. Storywise, it's a 1/5- totaling a 6/10.

dkxzn6i,"It was OK. Technically it was a very impressive film, but from both a character and acting perspective, very underwhelming IMO. Not developing anyone yet following ostensible leads makes it hard to care, and except for Mark Rylance, kind of, nothing about the acting was anything special. Hell, I didn't even understand that Tom Hardy was the pilot till the end, he was completely replaceable. I am half and half on the score; when there were droning sounds and percussion the OST did a great job at creating tension, but any orchestral arrangements (save for the end) really fell flat to me.

Not a terrible film, just not as good as I thought it would be. I'm not trying to stir the pot, it's just that Nolan has generally been good at establishing characters in his movies, so something this character deficient (imo) was a bit of a let down.",6ol0kp

The difficulty understanding many people (most notably the fighter pilots) didn't help the movie's case at all.

But other than that, this film was fucking fantastic. I think it's my favorite film of the year so far, and definitely in the upper echelon of Nolan's filmography. ",6ol0kp
dkijf3y,"[My review, 9/10] (http://actorvsactor.blogspot.hk/2017/07/dunkirk-review-guts-over-glory.html?m=1)

One thing I don't touch on in my review, is that I think the film gives its soldiers a lot more humanity than some give it credit. Take the scene where Tommy and Gibson bring the wounded soldier on board the departing ship. You watch the other soldiers cheer them on as they cross a narrow plank on the dock, tell others to pave a route for the two men. Then as chaos ensues, the men on the dock are picked off with brisk and brutal efficiency. The effort of Tommy and Gibson to bring the wounded man on board is ultimately futile; the final image of him is lying motionless, not breathing as the ship sinks.",6ol0kp
dkist95,"Absolutely incredible. 

Saw this in 70mm IMAX at the BFI (To those of you that also did, please fill out the survey to ensure we get more of this because it is possibly the most beautiful format). 

This is pure cinematic filmmaking, the scale, the sound design(especially Hans Zimmer's score, the gunshots and aircraft engines), the use of practical effects, nobody is making films like this anymore, it's reminiscent of films such as Lawrence of Arabia and Ben Hur. The level of showmanship on display is incredible. The film just builds and builds in tension and keeps it up throughout the film while allowing time for the quieter moments but it feels as if it never lets up.  The spitfire battles were a standout, especially because of the aerial IMAX photography, it puts you right in there. 

The reviews led me to believe that's all the film would be, but the film is smarter than that with the intertwining timelines which are all laid out very clearly at the beginning and become clearer and clearer before crossing over in a way that's incredibly impactful before departing again. It was masterfully done and allows us to experience the different aspects of Dunkirk to their fullest. 

I was also incredibly moved by the film and found myself invested in each of the characters journeys, it was visual storytelling and I didn't have an issue with character development. 

I felt proud to be British during moments of the film, it's an amazing story. 

10/10 - My favourite film of the year so far and an incredible theatre experience but I don't think it's my favourite Nolan film. I would still put The Dark Knight, Inception and Memento ahead.",6ol0kp

dkn3cz1,"I'm mildly irritated by people claiming the timelines were a gimmick or something. Nolan absolutely put a lot of thought into why we cut from one scene to another.  

A great example is when Tommy makes it onto his first ship eating jam on toast, a ship which will start sinking at any moment, which is juxtaposed with the scene of George loading life-vests onto his dad's boat before they sail off. The cruel irony is that Tommy's scene took place days ago when the soldiers really needed all the life-vests they could get.",6ol0kp

dki9iv3,"There’s not another director today making movies the way Christopher Nolan makes movies.

The man doesn’t just write a story and then shoot it. He crafts a visceral experience where the “way” you see and hear and “experience” the movie is equally as important as the traditional “what” you see and hear.

On more than one occasion Nolan has created movies that showed little beholding to conventional motion picture concepts like space and time. That sounds a bit overblown maybe, but it’s not: Most movies don’t even think about messing with their own internal chronology. Some two hour movies take place over the course of one dinner date, some take place over a ninety year life, but for the most part the things that happen in the movie happen along a very liner point-A to point-B to point-C structure. Even movies that break the mold, like Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction, do so in such a way that the audience is able to follow along easily with what is happening and when, and there are still very clearly defined mini-journeys from mini-point-A to mini-point-B; there are small liner storylines happening that you can follow once you get the hang of it.

Nolan’s movies have often thrown linearity out the window and instead put the audience in a disorienting situation where they’re never quite sure when or where something is happening, at least not on the first viewing. It’s like how pilots talk about “the graveyard spiral” which describes the dangers of flying at night without properly reading your instruments; an untrained pilot can lose all sense of orientation, to the point where he could be flying straight into the ocean and not even realize it until it’s too late.

Nolan loves throwing his audiences in a cinematic-graveyard spiral, sending them scenes and images without a linear orientation. He disorients his audience so that they can’t follow the story very easily, but you never grow frustrated because what you see and hear has been finely-tuned from script to shoot to make you kind of instinctively and subconsciously able to follow along, even if on a conscious level you can’t.

Ordinarily, a film like Dunkirk would be laid out in a linear fashion, starting with the dangers on the beach. After suffering along with a great and understated (which is why it’s great) Kenneth Branagh on the beach, we’d then be introduced to Mark Rylance who captains a personal yacht to the warzone in order to rescue as many as his little ship can carry. Along the way he and his sons would meet Cillian Murphy, a seaman brought down by a German U-boat and suffering from shellshock. And then, right as things get really harrowing, as the grounded troops come under threat of bombers, we’d meet Tom Hardy and his RAF pilots, who swoop in to save the day.

Told traditionally the movie still would have been great, but Nolan doesn’t do traditional. Nolan just unravels the space-time continuum for kicks and giggles, and he presents a movie that has three different timelines, and overlaps them so that you're disoriented like you're in a nightmare (which is a great way to present a war movie).

It's an amazing, visceral experience that has to be enjoyed in an IMAX theater.",6ol0kp
dkie6xj,Did everyone notice how we didn't see a single German soldier the entire film? It reminded me of people discussing Jaws and how it was much scarier because we didn't see the shark most of the time. ,6ol0kp
dkigszv,"Dunkirk begins by telling you in three short lines what happened in this little-known story about World War II. Soon after the War had started, the British and French troops were trapped in this French sea town as the Germans circled in. The British and French troops waited “for deliverance”. “For a miracle”.
Then, nothing in this taut, tense, relentless film, plays like a miracle, or feels like deliverance. War seldom does, and Christopher Nolan, the man who has made superheroes darker, dreams loopier and space vaster, isn’t letting you forget that. There are few heroes in Dunkirk, and no battles. The actual act of heroism by the men and women who rushed in with their small boats from across the English Channel to rescue the forces is almost a cipher, though it is this that led to this story be known as the “Miracle of Dunkirk”.
No, Nolan is telling you about defeat, the blood, sweat and tears of it; how it settles into your bones, sets in your face, moves your clawing fingers, hardens your scared heart. He is telling it from the seas, skies and land, and if you are catching it in IMAX, there is just no looking away, from any angle as Nolan goes over, under, in and out, about the men.
At the end of Dunkirk’s 116-minute length – the short duration for a war, you are as tired, feel as futile as the men tumbling off and into boats. The Hans Zimmer music, led by the violin (aptly described by someone as “the most anxious of instruments”), is as urgent, as ominous, as edgy.
The writer-director, who loves playing with time, again tells the story of that week in a non-linear sequence. It’s an unnecessary tool here, but it allows him to simultaneously focus on three things that were happening in that May-June 1940 rescue effort, as the world still nudged itself awake to Hitler’s possibilities. There are the soldiers in Dunkirk, pushed to a narrow stretch of beach half covered in sea foam; there is the Royal Air Force told to largely stay away; and there are the men in small boats called for help by the desperate British government as bigger ships couldn’t pick up the men from the beach.
Nolan has got great actors essaying each of those roles. On the beach (the chapter dubbed ‘Mole’), but for the theatre-ly Kenneth Branagh, the roles of two lost, frightened and lonely soldiers are played by the virtually unknown Fionn Whitehead and Aneurin Barnard. The desperation with which they grab a stretcher with a dying soldier and run to a medical ship, in a chance to get off the beach, is heartbreaking. The plight of the men who knew death was so near, nearer than the home that lay just 30 miles away — “close enough to almost see it” – is told through largely these two men, who remain virtually wordless, and nameless. And later by Harry Styles.
The air chapter has Tom Hardy and two other pilots fending off the German bombers, who are targeting any big ship trying to make it to the beach. Hardy is covered in his mask almost all through the film, but his eyes and those firm fingers tell a story.
On the sea, the third chapter, we meet Mark Rylance (having quite a run these days), his son and his deck hand, who are responding to the British government’s call to help and rushing off to Dunkirk in their yacht. It’s here that Nolan allows himself some talk, about fighting, about defeat, about heroism, about “old men who dictate wars” and “send young children to fight them”. And about airplanes, a lot of them. It’s not always convincing.
Dunkirk does hold no promise of heroes you can cheer or mourn for, or of people whom we know beyond what they did that day. There are no photos tucked in wallets, no letters to post, no messages to deliver. Death comes quickly, without ceremony; boats sink fast, with just a whoosh as warning; and planes go down slowly, like a bird in agony. But the faces you will remember, the faces of men holding their toast and jam, staring at death, and looking uncomprehendingly at hope.
It’s after Dunkirk that Winston Churchill gave his famous speech about “fighting them on the beaches…”, “never surrendering”, and hoping for the New World to come to the rescue of the Old. As desperate men in boats again lap on Europe’s shores, that prayer sounds as bleak as it did that day.",6ol0kp

A really well crafted movie with outstanding cinematography and music, but lacked the true 'grit' I've come to expect in post Private Ryan war films.

The loud sound effects and music were extremely affecting, causing me to wince several times, but the clean/bloodless visuals caused something of a disconnect.

Whilst I appreciate the time-jumping from a narrative perspective, I often found it undercut the tension, as we were whisked between different events happening at different times, just as they were becoming thrilling.

Bad pacing with constant action scenes which just become tiresome after the first hour and little to no down time. ",6ol0kp
dko5an6,"Loved some of Nolan's past work but in all honesty I was disappointed with this. The build-up and the sound were great at building tension, but the escalation simply dried up after half an hour. It was so stubborn in sticking with practical effects that the whole thing looked so low scale - only a few boats at a time, or a couple of planes, or a few hundred soldiers. The actual event involved hundreds of vehicles and hundreds of thousands of people - this looked like a low budget TV episode. In particular the stirring sight of civilian boats coming in to save the day - in reality there were 700 but here there were about 10. It looked ridiculous.

I didn't feel attached to any of the characters and thought some of the plot mechanics were very clumsily done - particularly with the decision to force someone off a 10-tonne boat to save weight. Wow, really? Also, the whole thing was too ""clean"" - these were supposed to be exhausted, starving soldiers at their desperate end, but these looked like they'd just stepped out of a hotel.

There were a couple of emotionally stirring parts but I felt I had to do a lot of the work in creating them - the spectacle and the emotional involvement weren't there. Apart from the sound and the music this was just a disappointment. If it was any other director apart from Nolan, I feel a lot more people would think so.",6ol0kp

This movie was directed so disjointedly you never get emotionally connected and the music and score actually distracted from the realness and seriousness it was meant to help.

dkl0qn2,"Ok ready to get downvoted for my opinion as it goes against the circlejerk about this movie but I really did not like this movie at all. 

This was the most boring war movie I ever had to drag myself through.

There's barely any dialogue in this movie so it relies for 90% on the music.
The problem is that there's constantly tense music blaring in scenes where absolutely nothing happens for minutes on end and it started to really annoy me 20 minutes into this movie.
There's also really not enough time spend with any of the characters and actual character development for me to actually get emotionally interested in any of them. Oh so George died, I don't really care nor did I about any of the others (maybe it's intended like this by Nolan but for me it just didn't work).  

Also kudos to the mastermind of an army commander that thought lining up regiments on an open beach to just be shot like fish in a barrel by German planes. Could've at least let them dig some trenches for more cover or just take cover in the actual houses of Dunkirk or let some of them help to hold the last line of defense. 

Here we have literally 3 guys that have to defend any potential incoming Germans, and they station 10 regiments out in the open just on the beach behind them without any AA. Maybe a bit of a nitpick but it still kinda frustrated me.

The only redeeming factors were the dogfights and the scene of the engine-less Spitfire floating over the beach for me.

dki9gnx,"Man, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.

I just got back from seeing it in 70mm IMAX, and I am totally underwhelmed. Honestly, I think it's not the format to see it in. I was sitting pretty much smack-dab in the middle of the theater and the screen was just *too big*. You can't look at all of it. Plus, while the shots are very big, allllmost all of it is empty space, and the top is sky and the bottom is beach or water. So you have this HUGE shot, and the top 1/5^th and the bottom 1/5^th are basically just white or blue. There was very rarely anything actually going on in those parts of the screen, so... why the trouble? The dogfighting sequences felt like they earned being in IMAX but everything else? Eh.

I didn't even find it tense. I got surprised by loud noises in quieter scene (initial shots, and when they're hiding in the boat) but that's about it. Something about it completely failed to rope me in.

Completely unsarcastically, my favorite thing about the movie by far was Kenneth Branagh's uniform. I was like yeah, lookin' sharp man.

It's probably the first Nolan movie that I don't even at least *like*. Though they were pretty flawed, there were things about TDKR and Interstellar that I *really* liked and *really* worked for me, and I felt that everything in Dunkirk fell flat.

Though I know I will likely be in the minority here, especially among people who are already discussing it because they saw it opening day. I was never that interested in it but got convinced to see it by all the positive reviews coming out.

To give you a sense of how ""meh"" my reaction was, it's the first movie in a long time where on the way home I was kicking myself for spending money on it.

Isn't it one of the main things that put people off from history, when it's told by a bad book or a weak teacher, it becomes just a list of events and statistics you feel completely detached from? I honestly don't get what's good about the approach Nolan has chosen. Nice cinematography and impressive sound design, but that's about it. And speaking about realism — go to the military subs or watch an actual war footage on youtube — people trip on things, shoot the shit with each other and laugh, having random regular conversations while being in the middle of the fight, it all feels very surreal, this movie is nothing like it — it's mind-bogglingly serious and sterile.",6ol0kp
dkjxnnv,"This was a 5/10 at best for me.

As a viewer I felt zero sense of urgency for the main characters. I didn't even realize the French soldier died, I think he died at least? For a while I even thought the other Soldier was also French, until he finally spoke on the first ship.

The scope of the film was so underwhelming it's all I could talk about with my wife on the ride home. You see maybe a thousand soldiers on the beach and in the end we see maybe 20 civilian boats come to the rescue. There were 5 or 6 enemy aircraft that attacked and it was over in a few seconds. Then in the end the beaches were suddenly empty. What was at stake? The British LTC mentions the eastern border of the city once to make us aware that the Germans are breaking threw, which I thought was lazy and a cheap way to remind us that there was a threat on the ground.

Who was the enemy again? /s.

The music was loud and blocked the little dialogue the movie had. The editing was weird, they randomly jumped back a few minutes in the Sea and Air portions with little addition to the plot which was confusing. Then it was night time at the Mole and day time in the Air and Sea portions. 

The 3 plots where pretty boring and the Air portion seemed irrelevant except to watch one boat sink, two allies get shot down and run out of gas. 

Three better story arcs IMO would be:

1. The battle in the city with a French perspective, which would in turn give us a sense of urgency for those on the beach and the scale of what was at stake. It would allow us to understand the sacrifices being made by the French as was briefly mentioned by the Lieutenant Colonel and Lieutenant and give a dam reason for that ticking clock we hear all movie long.

2. Focus on the real battle in the sky which took place miles away from the beaches. It would give us a break from the slow pace on the beaches and could easily have been tide together by following the few planes that break through and hit the beach.

3. Combining the civilian ""Sea"" story with the ""Mole"" to return us to the ""so what"" of the movie and follow the amazing withdraw and recovery of 300,000+ soldiers. Show us the true scale of the 400,000 soldiers and the amount of boats it would have taken to do this. Spend more time with them together.

dki6dcc,"A technically polished war film with a flat screenplay is just that; a technically polished war film with a flat screenplay. I’m more interested in how this film will age due to its lack of talking points beyond “DAE spectacle?!”

Most of Nolan’s previous films, regardless of what people may think of them, have standout aspects that are either often discussed or made fun of.

*Memento*’s experimental structure. Batman/Joker. Baneposting. Everything in *The Prestige*/*Inception*. Even the pseudo-intellectual *Interstellar* is still circlejerked, with attention or mockery being drawn to parts of it (for instance the docking scene).

What does *Dunkirk* bring to the table that hasn’t been seen before? What does the film have beyond superficial aspects that come with its premise of whizzing bullets and loud noises filmed in 70mm? Plane Dogfight #3? Sinking Ship #5?

Not even the “intensity” or “suspense” is all that great if you seen a fair share of films about war. This is made worse due to the the flat writing for every character that makes it hard to care about any of these fleeting faces.

Take last year’s Best Foreign Language Film nominee *Land of Mine*, another World War II film based on real events that also puts the viewers in the situation the characters are in, and actually succeeds at it because it doesn’t skimp on the writing to make way for superficial gloss.

Each one of the land mines being disarmed in *Land of Mine* had way more intensity and suspense, and that was a film built off the backs of its three-dimensional characters. Hard to be empathetic about random characters who are often not even named.

The Internet loves bashing Cameron’s *Avatar* for its “lack of cultural impact”. Can’t wait to see the response when *Dunkirk* ages like stale bread. Will the rabid obsession over Nolan overpower rationale? Or will people realize Nolan went and made his most forgettable film?",6ol0kp
dkkrhyr,"I'm gonna get downvoted for this, but the reviews of this film are a bit ridiculous. 

I'd say the movie's a c+ at best. 

The cinematography and sound design were pretty much the only good things about this film. The way it's edited is just a complete mess, sporadically jumping from tone to tone. This has been said but there's close to no dialogue. Not that that is bad in on itself, but if the hook of the film is wanting to see the characters survive, then do something to make me care about the characters. They just stand around in complete silence almost as if this is totally normal and nothing's wrong. I sat there wondering why I should care about anything going on beyond the general concern for human life, because there are no relationships between the characters, not even the fishing boat guy and his two young wards. 

I'm sure everyone's gonna say ""you don't get it"" or ""you're wrong,"" but honestly I spent most of the film day dreaming about what I would do once it was finally over. ",6ol0kp
dkjoo8h,"Not as good as I wanted it to be, and I honestly felt like something was missing. Nolan makes such a big deal out of the fact that he uses very limited amount of cg and I like that, but in this film I feel like it would have improved the film. During certain scenes I could see buildings in the background that looked like they were built in the 80s, and also the beach did not feel like it had 400 000 people on it. Small things like this took me out of the movie, but other then that it was a fine film. ",6ol0kp

dkl40hh,"I do not like Christopher Nolan. An opinion of him I strongly agreed with that I once read was 'Nolan is a Michael Bay for people who read a book once or twice'. Perhaps a bit unfair, but it succinctly put into words my reservations about his films. They are often overwrought to the point of near-comedy, as extravagantly unsubtle as a bag of hammers to the brain and believe themselves to be far more cunning than they are.

THAT ALL BEING SAID, when I walked from the theatre this morning, I looked at my sister and said:

""Well, I now officially absolutely *love* a Nolan film. I'm not sure what to do with myself.""

*Dunkirk* has become perhaps my favorite World War II film to date, and possibly my favorite war film period. The way it was told, broken into time-scaled segments that all merged together as a greater narrative, the way that the importance of the individual was both downplayed and celebrated, the remarkable restraint (from Nolan) in how dramatic everything was framed - *Dunkirk* captured the futility, the heroism and how *awesome* war is. Awesome in the classic definition; awesome as something that is larger than us, something that overwhelms and overshadows and is both great and terrible. It did not glorify war. It did not condemn war. It did not judge the men it showed. Gibson, [the Frenchman, stole the identity of a dead Englishman to try and escape. He also sprinted a dying man to safety, and willingly left safe transport. He may have even killed the English soldier](#spoiler) - we will never know more about these characters, and ultimately it does not *matter*. 

All in all, I have to give it points anyway for having actual flying Spitfires, which is an easy way to my heart, but joking aside, I am surprised and pleased to find *Dunkirk* a film I'm itching to see again and to add to my collection.",6ol0kp

This is probably the most disappointed I've ever been in a movie. I thought it was mediocre at best. The cinematography and sound is amazing, but they're the only positive things I can say about the movie.

There was absolutely no reason to care about what happened to a single character. None of them had backstories, hell I'm pretty sure that George is about the only one that's actually named. Not only did they not have backstories, but they barely had personalities. They felt like props, not characters. None of the soldiers even had reasons to want to get home. There was no reason to feel emotionally attached to anyone in the movie, so I found myself not caring about their fate in the slightest. I also though that the movie did a terrible job of really showing just how dire the situation was. We didn't see the German army that had smashed the British and the French and forced them to retreat to Dunkirk. We didn't see the large amount of vehicles and heavy equipment that the British were forced to abandon in order to make their escape. The threat is never really established or shown, apart from a few Stukas doing bombing runs. If you knew nothing about the Dunkirk evacuation before seeing this movie, then you'd have no idea of the magnitude of the event. It just seems like a bunch of soldiers queuing up on a beach, occasionally being bothered by a couple of planes. Not the show of resolve that it was for the British.

I also felt that the movie did a terrible job at really getting across the tremendous bravery of thousands of regular people with absolutely no military training sailing their recreation boats across the English Channel into a war zone to rescue their fellow countrymen. Sure we saw George and the others on their boat, but that was about it until near the end of the movie where a bunch of civilian boats just showed up out of nowhere. I didn't feel that I was really seeing thousands of people rallying together to pull off an amazing feat.

I couldn't disagree more with people calling this movie a masterpiece and Christopher Nolan's best movie. I think that this is easily his worst work to date. It's a shame, as I really wanted to like it.",6ol0kp

I'll say this though. We should be glad to get a movie made like this by a good director. A movie that he wanted to make that was shot beautifully in the way he wanted to do it. If only it was being shown on 70mm everywhere. Even if you don't like it we should glad to have seen it and not just a new super hero movie. Even though war movies have been done before this felt fresh to me. 
I don't know it's hard for me to get my point across because I am not a good writer but I'd rather see this a million times than something that looks like it will be throw together garbage like justice league.

Some say that they couldn't relate to the characters, but this was the complete opposite for me. I felt connected to every character in Dunkirk and became emotionally invested in their survival despite minimal to no backstory. I think this might be because of the way the movie essentially throws you into their boots. Every scene was shot in such a way that I felt like I was sharing their struggle, especially the near-drowning ones.

The thing I disliked the most was how cheesy and melodramatic the second half was. Lying ""he's going to be okay"" to Cillian Murphy's character after [George dies](#spoiler), the soldier feeling embarrassed about returning alive, George being made a hero, the admiral staying behind, and the newspaper monologue felt very out of place. It was like random propaganda pieces were inserted into the movie, because these actions were mostly inconsistent with the previous actions of their characters and had no lead up.


I felt the music was overkill. Early on there was a ton of dramatic bgm being played when nothing was happening. I understand they were setting an ominous tone, but when it was repeated every few minutes it felt rather silly. Also that scene at the end when the Dunkirk troops start cheering after seeing the assorted boats arrive, and then that dramatic music came on as [an enemy plane is spotted. I felt the British spitfire appeared out of nowhere to save the day. Especially the scene before showed him out of fuel and gliding to ground, but suddenly he's able to one-shot the Nazi plane when every previous scene emphasized how hard it is to land a hit?](#spoiler). 


Cinematography was great though. There were some very beautiful shots, and the aerial dogfights were captured brilliantly.

dkr5gg7,"Reposting my opinion from another thread:

I didn't form any emphatic relationship with what I was watching. I spent more time trying to tie threads in my head connecting what I was seeing and making sense of it. I hear people mention the lack of character development but after watching interviews with Nolan explaining his intention to make it subjective I felt I understood better. However, it was still missing something. A great example was the scene where Styles' character was accusing the French guy. That felt tense. Simple scenes and interactions like this among the soldiers would've made me feel their emotions more. It doesn't have to entail this huge backstory to each character.

Yes, it was an immersive 'experience' but I felt half dipped into the the soldiers and human aspect of it all. The intention was clearly to put you in the event and I just don't know if I personally like that. The subjective POV puts this distance between me and feeling the emotion that I just can't explain.

It felt anti-climactic at parts. The scene where the kid dies on the boat, in my head I literally said ""Really?"" and you can imagine my reaction when he was named a 'hero' in the paper. Also, the ending when it all comes together, the pilot saves the day, the boats arrive, I was just like ""Uh.. that's it?""

The narrative structure was confusing at first but after spending some time digesting it all and hearing what Nolan and the actors have to say I feel compelled to go see it again. Also, not trying to compare this film in any way but I had just seen War for the Planet of Apes and I left that theater with multiple lumps in my throat. The best films make me feel intense emotions. I left the Dunkirk feeling like I just had weak sex.

That being said, I am gonna go see it again and I think my opinion will improve.",6ol0kp

dknkr0z,"Well... I'm not sure what to say on this.  I stayed away from all reviews and trailer going in with no expectations whatsoever other than that it had something to do with war, and that Christopher Nolan wrote and directed it.  Though I did check out the trailer after I saw it and I think seeing that first would have left me even MORE disappointed if that's somehow possible.

At first there was a lot of setup, which is fine, I figured the stage was just getting set for awesome/interesting things to happen.  Then I was waiting for it to get interesting... and waiting... and... then it ended.

Apparently there were three different timelines/stories going on at once?  When I was watching the movie I thought it was all one, until I saw it go from day to night back to day again.  I remember my friend asking me ""wait why is it night time?"" and I didn't have a good explanation, I figured later it would make sense.

When Cillian Murphy went down into the boat, I was like ""oh okay awesome, NOW is when the real story is going to start and we'll actually care about something and not be bored to tears.""  Granted, that section ended up being at least somewhat entertaining, but more in a 'default-entertaining' way.  As in, if you were in a pure desert with sand as far as you could see in any direction, but then you stumbled across a rock.  Normally the rock wouldn't be terribly special, but compared to all that fucking sand it's a pretty entertaining find.

Other than the realism, I don't get all the adoration.  People get on a boat, the boat gets bombed.  People get on another boat, boat gets bombed, another boat, another bombing, etc...  Realistic?  Sure.  I could make an ultra-realistic movie about dudes dropping bombs in toilets as well, would that be a masterpiece?

The dogfights at least could have been interesting, but they weren't at all.  ""Oh look, another sequence where a dude who sucks ass is probably going to hit another fighter but also go down himself.""  BTW why was Tom Hardy in this movie at all?  Even Tommy Wiseau could have played that part with ease.

Sorry, I just really had to vent some frustration on this one.  Before I saw this I was willing to blindly see any Christopher Nolan movie, but definitely not anymore.  Like... what was he THINKING?!

Saving Private Ryan had realism, a great story, great characters, great pacing, made sense, and basically was just a godly movie all around.  Other than the realism aspect, Dunkirk was the exact opposite.",6ol0kp

For me, it was, at times visually gorgeous and interesting, but came across as a big budget pretentious boring mess. There is essentially no narrative beyond what you already know from history. Some soldiers are trapped at Dunkirk and a lot of them leave. There's no characters. Barely any dialogue and what dialogue they have is drowned out by Hans Zimmer's score or, more so, painfully loud tones with no melody. You legit can't hear dialogue it's so loudly obnoxious at times. The acting is wooden with no one reacting to people getting murdered. It feels like you're following nameless boring soldiers from one action set piece to the next until it just kinda ends. Easily, Nolan's worst film.

Where to begin to list how many things the film excels in – The soundscape, the whine of the plane engines, and how you can hear the difference between the British and the enemy fighters, each bullet cracks, each explosion thuds, you feel it in your body, and Hans Zimmer’s score with that constant ticking clock, wow. Also, the desire to film as much practically as possible really helps with selling the reality of what these men went through. 

 
How everything is about survival, and how that leads to good people doing bad things, there is no sugar coating here, people die, this is war. But also that resilience, that in the face of utter defeat, a whole country rallied around getting people home.

The story was very simple which is completely acceptable for a war film, so there's no fault there. Performances were impeccable especially Kenneth Branagh and tom hardy ofcourse. The opening sequence made me understand from the get-go how real Nolan wanted the war to look and how little he wanted his audience to feel. He put us in a position of helplessness from the start and slowly built us up to a position of power [when farrier (tom hardy) decided to sacrifice himself and when the civilian boats came](#spoiler). The flight sequences though were definitely my favorite part of the movie. It was like if the Starwars destruction of the deathstar was filmed again but with real planes and a real war. The cinematography was so good during those scenes that it got to the point where i was like ""how the fuck is this even possible"" then i realized it's Nolan and all his movies are like that in some aspect of film making. Here's my criticism: I know Nolan films are beloved for it's dependence on the viewers memory but the jumping back and forth between timelines just so unexpected and unneccesary, especiallly when at some point i was actually mixing up characters and saying to myself ""Wait, is this new info or did we see this already?"" and not in the cool way like in Momento, to me it was a just a little frustrating and didn't payoff. That didn't bother me so much though. The film was genuinely scary. Not like jump scare horror movie scary, I mean Kubrick's the shining scary. The sound mixing and the score just has me on edge the whole time and i was truly terrified of the unknown along with the characters in the movie. And the ticking... THE TICKING. Thank god that wasn't just a gimmick in the trailer.. they actually used it throughout the whole movie which was amazing and also terrifying. All in all, bravo Mr. Nolan on a truly chilling and real war film and on commemorating the brave people and events taken place in Dunkirk. Loved it.",6ol0kp

dkl5mgo,"I wasn't a fan. To me, Dunkirk was all tension and build up with no real payoff. It's not a very emotional movie as we have relatively little emotional connection of any of the protagonists. That's a deliberate choice by Nolan to make the story about the everyman. Yet at the same time we're supposed to cheer and clap at the triumph of the civilian fleet arriving and at Churchill's speech when we don't see the ships getting rallied nor the British people really banding together. I get that Nolan is trying to portray as realistic a war as possible with morally ambivalent characters but it comes off too cold that it feels unrealistic in how little emotion, especially joy, any of the characters show in one of the feel good but bittersweet events of WW2. 

Dunkirk is a very pretty historical reenactment piece. But its essentially just an elongated version of those short action scenes in between narration that you see in documentaries. As a movie, as a narrative, as a historical window into minds of the past, I see it as a failure.

Also I hate the nonstop blaring soundtrack of the movie. So many long stretches of pointless noise to build tension that you eventually get used to it and none of the scenes feel tense anymore because the movie has been screaming at you for over an hour.",6ol0kp

I wound up reading extensively about Dunkirk, the battle, the
evacuation, and with all the history, it's disappointing that the movie covered little-to-none of the significant history.  So much time wasted on action.

dkjzg3j,God Nolan does it again ,6ol0kp
dkkurwp,"I'm kind of on the fence about this movie.

I'm not sure I liked the multi perspectives, but obviously that's what Nolan was going for.  Nolan wanted to show the audience that everyone experience's war in a different manner, and the different time frame's reflected that.  

However, for me, the movie felt like it lacked depth.  I found myself a bit bored at times, and I wasn't totally immersed in the story.  Maybe it's because we never really develop a strong connection to the characters?  I'm not sure.  But for me, something just felt a bit off.

Also, did anyone else notice the lack of music in this film?  There were times when I was watching and noticed that it was eerily silent (probably to capture the moment).

I'd definitely give it a 7 or an 8 / 10, but I don't think it's a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination.",6ol0kp

At first, the final shot of the film annoyed me (not the burning plane, but the quick switch to Alex's face), but on second viewing I sort of get what he was going for. I still think a cut to black after holding on the plane would have been better though.

I think certain key dialogue phrases (of which there are few) should have been ADR'd, honestly. You miss some shit on first viewing. And this is coming from someone who had ZERO issue with TDKR and Interstellar. Just goes to show what the downside of using IMAX cameras for 75% of the film is. One example would be George's final speech about wanting to make his dad proud. The audience NEEDS to clearly hear this shit because it makes his death and cover up more impactful.



Tom Hardy is a straight up bad ass.

The non-linear structure works better the second time because you know how to fit it all in your head.

The soundtrack by itself isn't as great as previous Nolan film scores by Zimmer, but Hans' methodical ticking that **literally** permeates ever second of the film was a beautiful idea. 

And as someone whose number one fear when it comes to death is **drowning**........

dkj586m,"I went to see this film with two buddies last night and as soon as the credits started rolling we agreed that this was something beautiful to watch and a fantastic experience film but not much more. Fortunately, what you do get to watch almost makes up for it entirely. I think this was one of the best ""show don't tell"" movies I've ever seen and those are my favorite types of films. The less dialogue the more I seem to enjoy it, and there wasn't much. I do like what Nolan did by splitting up the timeline. I was concerned how he was going to make a sit and wait war experience into something watchable, but he did it. However, as most people have mentioned, from a story-telling standpoint, that is where this film was lacking. The character draw was extremely weak. Not once in the movie did I find myself caring whether any of the people lived or died which made the whole experience very passive when it could have been extremely gripping. Most people know the story of Dunkirk, a lot of people were rescued and some were not. I wish Nolan would have used this to make me stress over the specific individuals we were following, putting me on the edge of my seat. I wish he would have made me worry for not knowing if these characters are ones that made it or not, rather than me just watching to find out. These people were essentially any of the other 400,000 soldiers to me. I've seen some counter points saying that's what he was going for, that these soldiers are all the same and should be interchangeable and unimportant in the grand scheme of things. But to me, that creates an impressive spectacle, not an engaging story and a good story out-does good visuals every time. We had a chance at both. 8/10",6ol0kp

dkkr06z,"It's a great suspense film and one of the best big budget films of the year, with the dogfights amongst the best aerial shots I've ever seen. 

I feel it's the Nolan movie with the fewest number of flaws, but also, the one that will be discussed the least once time passes. I mean, Interstellar, TDKR and even Inception had their flaws, especially the first two, but people still talk about them after all these years, discuss and argue about them. 

While with Dunkirk, I think most people will recognize it as Nolan's tightest and most well executed movie, but after a few years won't really discuss it as much as people discuss Interstellar, TDKR, TDK, The Prestige and Memento. Funnily enough this might very well be the film that gets him the top awards at The Oscars, as it's more of a *traditionally* well made film than say, Inception. 

But I really want Nolan to go back to making large, complex and original movies like Inception and Interstellar, which while not flawless, is something only he can do. I think Villeneuve could have made Dunkirk, and it would have had much the same effect and impact. But no one other than Nolan can make an Inception, or even a flawed Interstellar. So I hope he goes back to that for his next films, and not be constrained by an original story or a franchise(Bond).",6ol0kp
dkkzuws,"How amazing was the audio though? I don't think I want to rewatch this in anything but a theater or an top of the line audio set up. It was about as immersive as audio can get for a war movie and really gave you a sense of how frightening a battlefield must have been. Obviously not to say that I think it is anywhere near how horrifying the experience of actually being there must have been but it certainly does better than other films. 

I remember my mother telling me that upon release Saving Private Ryan was sort of framed as some standard war movie, but a lot of people were shocked at how far they went in trying to replicate the gore and it had a big effect on a lot of people; making people realise how horrific war actually is. I think Dunkirk achieved a similar effect except instead of the standard of gore, it was the sense of (Perhaps not a strong enough term) unease and lack of hope. The whole film kept you on the edge of your seat and every time the movie took one step towards some formulation of a happy ending, you took two steps back. I imagine that is somewhat what it was like being there, or if not it was simply a complete lack of hope and I also imagine that was the intention with the film. They didn't need gore or battle scenes to really help you appreciate how horrific war is, which is an amazing feat. 

I think Harry Styles did well; it's a bit of a champagne problem but I thought his boy band heart throb perception in the media really would have affected his role in such a serious movie and I give him huge credit for taking the role because I imagine it would be hard to separate him from his real life persona. But I think he and the writers did a great job of making him fit in and not be notable at all, beyond what his role required - in comparison, Ed Sheerans cameo in Game Of Thrones is at the other end of the spectrum as a shining example of how not to integrate notable non acting stars into a series. Not sure if this is what it was but to be honest a lot of those younger characters looked like they could be in a boy band and perhaps that helped normalize Harry in the role; it also had the added affect of making the soldiers seem extremely young, which added to the second paragraph I wrote. 

And finally, it's not some amazing piece of film making but I loved how the blonde boy on the boat told Cillian Murphys character that George would be okay, after George had passed away. I think very few people are mature enough to swallow that pill and I think even most audience members weren't expecting him to do that, and would probably rather vent their frustrations.

However, the lack of strong character development really made it tough to care for any of the characters. The two fighter pilots are the only ones I really found myself rooting for. Maybe Nolan was trying to portray the anonymous nature of the situation, but to me it felt like watching a documentary without the commentary. The timeline changes had some throwbacks to Memento but again, rather than focus on a small group in depth it hits many people in a superficial way. For many, if we found out the characters motivations it didnt happen until the back half of the film.

The kid on the boat felt like a red shirt from the start, the Frenchmen dying brought little surprise, the navy guy staying back? Good for him, I guess. Overall, I found myself not attached enough to really any character to care what happened to them.

I did very much like the end though with the Churchill speech.

Passable, sterile offering. I'm more and more confident that Nolan is a great european designer (metaphorically so), with those cold, angular matte scenes. He shines on that (thanks to Michael Mann mostly) and his movies are aesthetic to a fault. There's not enough meat. And I don't mean ka-booms and splatter, no. He tries to force some emotion through some touchy script moments, designed only for that. But he fails, he doesn't have much emotion really. A shame.

Points go for the spectacle, the show, the theater was booming and splattering sounds like crazy! And for the family boat storyline. Hans Zimmer... well, tiny bits of brilliance but overall a dull soundtrack. Thin Red Line OST by the man himself was way more engaging.

dkk0jci,This movie was great on a technical but it was incredibly weak in terms of writing and character development. I haven't really loved a Nolan movie since Inception. I think he's a talented director but he also has a style over substance mindset that didn't really work well in this film. I don't have a problem with visual storytelling and not relying a lot on dialogue and simplistic characters but everything seemed so unfocused and boring that I didn't really give a shit about the stakes or any of the characters at even the most basic level. The best actor/character was Cillian Murphy because he was one of the few characters that actually seemed to have more layers to him than meets the eye. Every other character was incredibly bland and blended into the other. I would only recommend this film to people who are really interested in WW2 and history in general. I think there are plenty of other movies that are able to capture the scope/scale of a war while still allowing you to care about the characters. This is a good movie but not a great one.,6ol0kp

I felt like the movie was 30 minutes too short.  The one character whose sole purpose was to [kill george](#spoiler) really didn't add anything to the movie that the others couldn't have through their experiences.  U-Boat, check.  Drowning scenes, check.

Also, in the confusion of the ending I lost track of what happened to the French dude.

Overall I'm just disappointed.  I think I would rate this as my least favorite Nolan film.  Interstellar had problems with it's ending, but I felt I could care about the characters more.  Throwing lots of explosions and suspense at a screen doesn't make for a cohesive story line with characters you can build a narrative around.

dkpbuuf,"It wasn't terrible and there were good moments but man has this film been overrated.

Instead of going into everything - will just say that as a screenwriter Nolan was incredibly negligent with the character of Tommy. The film starts with all his comrades getting killed, and then throughout the film he almost DROWNS not once but THREE times (and has most of his new comrades killed in the process).

A better writer would have had the character start off one way, then with each successive near death experience he would change in some way as a result. But Tommy might as well be a video game character, he seems no different from surviving his first near death experience to his last.

Actually - the only personage in the entire film with any clear dramatic development is the kid on the ship - and he gets put out of commission half way through. Most of the characters are static ciphers and thus for me I had very little emotional investment in the film as a whole.

The acting just kinda felt like regular soldiers on the field, which don't get me wrong is great for this film, but I didn't feel a connection to them. As for the score, I felt as if the intense ""back and forth"" style suspense music was used way too frequently. Other than that it was just okay, nothing that knocked me out of the park.

It also didn't capture the scale at all, because Nolan is allergic to CGI. The soundtrack also didn't do it for me, and essentially felt like nothing more than background ambient bass and ticking. Also a minor nitpick, but did Brits in the 40's not swear at all, even in life or death situations?

I've seen a lot of comments saying this stuff is somehow what made the movie great. A distinctly original director's vision doesn't make something great if that vision is flawed.

Most of the movie lacks dialogues and pretty much all of the characters lack any sort of depth or background, making Dunkirk feel impersonal and sterile. This creates a lack of emotional stakes and takes out most of the tension from it no matter how many ticking clocks Hans Zimmer puts in the soundtrack. It is a beautifully shot movie by the great DP Hoyte Van Hoytema and technical proficiency is in no way disputed.

Of course thats all assuming you could count anyone in this movie as a ""character"" at all. Not a single one has any more depth than a single defining characteristic. There's patriotic guy, PTSD guy, ace pilot guy, posh officer guy, French coward guy, and of course bland audience self-insert guy. One note characters can be made to work if they're acted well and given interesting situations to work with but there just aren't any.

The sound editing was good though

dkj37yz,"felt super hollow to me. Relying on a lot of exposition and use of the imagination to fill the holes. The scale felt way off, ""400,000 men"" when it showed like 200, and then these ""400,000 men"" all ducking on the beach once they heard planes coming, and it just shows, what...2 planes? I also thought it was interesting that they never even mentioned (much less showed) ""Germans"" or ""Nazi's"" it was always just ""the enemy."" And the whole running out of fuel, changing direction, shooting down a plane, changing direction again, and landing safely (again all while out of fuel) made me roll my eyes a bit. Wasn't a fan",6ol0kp

dkm9bo2,"I know this is going to be an unpopular opinion but, whatever... I think there wasn't really any character development in this movie (We never learned any of their names minus the kid that died after [the kid had his head beaten in by the shellshocked soldier the pleasure yacht rescued](#spoiler)) and it didn't really seem to introduce exactly why Dunkirk happened. It was also incredibly short. They could have done a better job introducing the conflict and exactly how the British and French got there i.e. that Hitler pushed back the initial defense of France all the way to the coast. Then they could've moved into the movie with more confidence that the viewers actually came away learning the history of the conflict rather than being under the assumption that the viewer was going to inform themselve(s) prior to seeing the movie.",6ol0kp

dki6r1f,The first view of the bomber coming to the beach gave me instant chills. ,6ol0kp
dki6thh,"Absolutely floored by this movie. What stood out the most to me was the sound. I'm not sure if it was as accentuated in other theaters as it was in mine, but the screeches and gunfire were terrifyingly sharp. It almost gave an animal-like quality to the planes and some of the ships. ",6ol0kp
dki6wk8,Those final shots when the plane ran out of fuel...breathtaking. What an amazing film overall. ,6ol0kp
dki6zhk,"Although most characters had very little dialogue, there was a strong sense of connection and understanding with each. 
The French soldier, who did not speak at all, was incredibly deep to me. For instance, Tommy thought he was staying outside of the ship for a quick escape, however, I feel Nolan was trying to portray a different idea through his actions. When the boat is hit, he decides to help open the door for the others, despite having the opportunity to quickly escape. From this I think it can be thought that his motivation wasn't to be able to have a quick escape, but rather since he was a French soldier on an English boat, he felt guilty about taking their supplies. Although this can't be confirmed due to the lack of dialogue, it can definitely be suggested. 
I felt each character had so many moments like this where simple things make them so much deeper than they appear. 
Also the fact that Tom Hardy was able to act so amazingly with only his eyes just demonstrates how great of an actor he is. 
RIP George. ",6ol0kp
dki6ztb,"* I loved that it never followed a main character and we never really knew anyone's name
* The aerial dogfights were the best thing about this movie. The way the camera moved and how we were in the cockpit was exhilarating
* Zimmer's score and the sound design in general were top notch. It was LOUD but it was awesome. When I heard the planes humming and hearing the bombs and machine guns go off, it gave me goosebumps
* To piggy back off that thought -- did the ticking of clock go the entire movie until the end? I felt like it was there subtle or not for the entirety of the film
* The different scenes of soldiers fighting for their lives, especially the drowning scenes were horrific. I can't imagine being trapped and helpless like that when the water is flooding into your boat or cockpit
* I am eager to see it again so I can nail down the different time changes/story lines that it splits between. It wasn't hard to notice what Nolan was doing, but now that I've seen it, it will be nice going in knowing about it
* The hate about Harry Styles being in this and being a distraction were overblown. I honestly never noticed him outside of just being another solider
* I can't fathom what it would have been like to be in this situation. The movie puts so much into perspective on how everyone is strictly just there to survive. Doesn't matter who you are, where you're from, just survive
* I'll need to see it a few more times, but I still don't know if I agree with everyone saying it is Nolan's best. I think I still prefer some of his other films to this, but in time it could change
* Tom Hardy is so badass in everything he does. Him taking out that last bomber without fuel was fucking sick
* Can't wait to hit the IMAX again for it! ",6ol0kp
dki707e,"The score of this movie blew me away.  So many scenes where the score created a tension that built and built and built to a climax that seemed to last forever.

dki7bjd,"Just got out of this one and am still reeling. Some thoughts: 

I feel like this is definitely Nolans best. The sound was very central to this movie and it worked. I would highly advise seeing this in theaters. We saw it on a 70 foot screen with 3D sound and it definitely paid off-everything was crispy and every sound was impactful. 

The action was definitely there but was used sparingly enough that each fight dealt some heavy punches and felt real. Every weapon and vehicle felt and sounded authentic. 

I feel like a big complaint will be that the characters weren't really memorable, but I feel that this was intentional. The movie was about the event itself, and it worked if you look at it in that way. 

The only complaint I have is the day and night could be a little confusing at times. Otherwise, sound was amazing, cinematography was fantastic, every sound felt like it packed a punch. This is a must-see in theaters. 

Overall, I'd give it a 9/10. Also, Tom Hardy was excellent as always.

All of motifs and tricks of cross-cutting and subjective perceptions of time that he's been perfecting his entire career are on full display here in their best execution.

Music and sound effects equally impressive.

However, I have to say (and my dad brought this point up, too, unprompted), that some studio executive has to override Nolan about the dialogue in relation to the sound mix.

I understand why he does it out of principle/ philosophically (can't always hear everything), but when Kenneth Branagh's Commander Bolton is relaying some wartime updates and I can't literally hear what he's saying, I'm taken out of the movie. I, as the viewer, am aware that I'm watching a movie, which is the exact opposite of what the director wants.

I have got to say I was underwhelmed that they didn't show more of the soldiers holding enemy forces at bay. There was a compelling storyline and it is deserving from a historical standpoint that these soldiers who held the outer perimeter be shown as well. I understand from an artistic and theatrical standpoint it was Nolans intention to keep the suspense going and the enemy hidden.",6ol0kp

A few shots reminded me of Kubrick and I eat that shit up. Aw well, I'm in a bar drinking thinking about the film. When shit gets tough, I'll just keep in mind the ol' Dunkirk spirit.

And the last fifteen minutes or so wrecked me; the hope in the beach soldiers' faces, Tom Hardy getting captured (??), Mark Rylance's story becoming clear, George in the newspaper, Harry Styles getting proved wrong in the sense that the British were proud of them....

First I want to say that I loved it. If anything was a disappointment was that it didn't last longer and that I wish I would've stayed away from the review thread which hyped it to impossible levels.

The movie was great. A great step in the auteur journet of Nolans. Great usr of sound. Great visuals. Not a performance movie but the event itself was the main character.  The way the movie flowed, thr rising and falling action usually signaled by the wailing of the german planes diving to attack was awesome. That last plane diving to attack almost got me and the characters only to be saved by the pilot(Hardy). 

I also loved the way hopelessness played into the main kids struggles to escape. Loved he wad there in the opening and ending shots. Loved that last shot and that last cut from the plane to the kids face.

Loved that last speech in the film. If this was released after the event in the 40s it would've been the greatest propagands film.

I got complaints too!

The hype for this was too much,  but it's my fault.

What the hell did Tom Hardy do at the end? Did he sacrifice himself for those gorgeous plane shots or what? Why did he land the plane that way and so far from the rest? Am I missing something?

I felt other that the dock scenes the beach looked empty when compared to Atonement or other representations of this event. Why? Or was I expecting too much?

There it is. No more complaints. A great movie. Solid 9/10. Now if I can see it in 70mm I will be happy, but I wont2be able to until the 1st so maybe I won't be able.",6ol0kp

See this in IMAX if you're able to, the deafening ding of every bullet hitting metal and screeching of the incoming bombers were genuinely flooring and terrifying.  Really helps you to have even a tiny understanding of the fear felt by these 400,000 odd men as well as all other men in modern wartime.

Seriously though, this movie is so incredible.  I couldn't believe how engaging and beautiful all of the cinematography was, I was constantly baffled by how they managed to pull off certain shots.  This is the Pulp Fiction of war movies in terms of storytelling, and we're not provided with many character names which I absolutely LOVE.  The main character of this film is the Dunkirk evacuation itself, and we are merely observing it from the perspectives of three different men.

Tom Hardy is an absolute badass.  What a freaking legendary character he played.",6ol0kp

But the *feeling* that an expertly captured and projected film image elicits is unmatchable. I'll be watching it again in digital IMAX, so that will be interesting to compare just that aspect.

dkibtfk,"Man, this movie was incredible. Two main takeaways, as I've only just walked out of the theater. Just a relentless, intense ride from the first sequence to the last. 10/10 for me.

1) The camerawork was astonishingly good. The point of view shots from the plane's wings were exhilarating, the scenes with the camera just at water level (that became underwater as the ships sank) made me grip my seat tighter, and the shots from the captain's wheel of Mark Rylance's boat were great too. Really amazing work that seriously amplified the intensity of these sequences.  

2) Saw it in IMAX, and could hardly understand a lot of the dialogue, and that shockingly, didn't detract from the movie at all. The action sequences, the aforementioned camerawork, and the acting (hat tip to Harry Styles, who was surprisingly good) all sort of spoke for themselves without needing much dialogue to usher the story along.

A lot of suspense, a host of beautiful shots, an overwhelming amount of emotion at the end that I didn't quite expect from such a seemingly straightforward story. Loved the playing around with time and the convergence of the timelines. Everything in this film was on point - direction, acting, cinematography, music... really just a filmmaker's film is the best way I can describe it. 

Also had a bit of an aha moment realizing that [the Frenchman that Tommy encounters early on who was burying the body had taken clothes from that body](#spoiler). I loved the little bits like that that spun out of the nonlinear style, including before and after of Cillian's character. Nobody does nonlinear quite like Nolan. 

Best film of the year is between this and Apes for me. Whether this is the best Nolan film... time and multiple viewings will tell. Right now, it's in the upper echelons at the very least (in an already very accomplished filmography where much of it is already upper echelons by default). 

Loved it, particularly on further reflection. Definitely some excellent filmmaking on display here, and I hope to see this again sometime soon. ",6ol0kp

While most here focus on details like the lack of a burning V12, I would add as a French, that I was relieved when I saw SOME elements about the French army. In the first few trailers, i saw nothing about them and i believed this was another ""brit were awesome"" movie. Thanks Nolan for adding some French soldiers and showing both armies lost the fight, not just the French. Also, the ""bon voyage"" at the start really hit me.

dkn1evs,"Anyone have thoughts about the aspect ratio changes? I saw the film in 70mm IMAX (glorious!) but many scenes on the Moonshot were in some widescreen variant (2.35:1 if I had to guess).

My interpretation is that the father and the two boys weren't yet ""in the war"", so it was shot with a bit more conventional feel. Smaller setting, more personal, etc. But I'm not sure if that would hold up under a second viewing. 

Curious if anyone has an explanation, or perhaps just a better guess. ",6ol0kp

dkteypr,Who was the third RAF pilot? The squadron leader?,6ol0kp
dkv3m4q,"Ok, I've just gotten back from watching and my friend and I are having a really hard time understanding this so maybe someone can clarify it for us:

 When we first meet Cillian Murphy he is starnded in the middle of the ocean, completely traumatized, with a bit of a beard about to be rescued by the old man in the civilian boat. HOWEVER, later in the movie we see the 2 main kids from the land part of the story attempt to get on one of the rescue boats only to be told they can't get in because the boat will sink form the weight by a soldier that leans close enough for the light to hit his face and reveal that this is a clean-shaven Cillian Murphy, thus revealing the stories are out of synch. Instead of letting them on the boat, the people on it throw a rope at the 2 guys and we eventually see them arrive at the beach safe and sound.

 So how did Cillian Murphy go from being on the boat rescuing soldiers and taking them back to the beach to being completely alone in the middle of the ocean, a couple of days later and so traumatized he was demanding the old man to stay away from the beach? Seems like a glaring mistake to overlook to have such an inconsistency in the movie. Either the Cillian Murphy was in the boat that rescued the 2 kids and took them back to the beach or he was in some other boat where shit went south and he ended up where we first meet him",6ol0kp
dkvqwp0,"In a movie that's full of great acting and background score, two scenes stood out for me. [The first was when Tommy, Alex etc. are inside the ship, under fire, and sinking interlaced with cuts of Collins sinking with his aircraft. It was one of the most thrilling scenes in recent times, one that almost made me feel sea sick. The second was the dialogue between Capt. Winnart and Commander Bolton when they see ships in the distance. To me, that's what movie drama should be like.](#spoiler)
There are so many layers to Nolan's narrative that this film is surely worth watching again. Loved it.",6ol0kp
dkvs5cx,"Would Nolan have been better served by avoiding bigger faces/names as some of the leads? I mean everyone gave strong performances, but as it was not a character driven war film, would it have been better to get more unknowns for the roles of Alex, Commander Bolton, Shivering Soldier, Farrier and Mr Dawson?  

You're never really given a chance to connect with the characters beyond the intense sympathy, so to me it felt hard to see these specific characters beyond their actor. A good litmus test for this is if I instinctively refer to them by their character names or real name. Nolan's focus was clearly on delivering a semi-accurate portrayal of an event and putting the audience in the hopeless, terrifying atmosphere - so why take them out of it by casting some extremely familiar faces, even for Nolan films. 

Either way, everyone delivered strong performances throughout. Some highlights were the three boys watching their comrade commit suicide, Branagh tearing up watching the flotilla arrive, and the Shivering Soldier asking the other boy if George was okay. ",6ol0kp

I liked how just about all of the actors were relative unknowns (I'm old... I don't know who Harry Styles is really either!)
It's definitely all about the style rather than character development etc and I personally thought it was a bit overly dramatic at points but I was glad I saw it.  I don't know if it will win an Oscar, but certainly deserves to be nominated.

It's going to seem like I'm just trying to be a contrarian here, but I honestly didn't love it.  It's the most overrated movie I've seen in a long time.  It's wonderfully shot and epic.  It's not without problems though.  First and foremost, it really has no characters.  I can't tell you anything about anyone in this movie.  It's hard to root for nameless faces.  Also it just kind of makes for a dull movie.  There's some moments of tension, but overall it's kind of just plodding and slow.  I imagine people who love war documentaries would love it.   Lack of story and character makes for a kind of boring film ",6ol0kp
dki87kd,"I didn't complain about the Bane dialogue in TDKR or even have much of an issue with the overwhelmingly loud parts of Interstellar but man did the sound mixing of Dunkirk affect my enjoyment of the film. I'm not sure if I should blame the theater I watched the movie in or if it's an issue inherent in the movie itself but I couldn't make out an entire sentence let alone conversations throughout the whole runtime. Even in the relatively quiet scenes with Mark Rylance. I like the loudness of the gunshots and explosions and felt they added to the intensity of the film; my issue is when that bleeds over the other tracks and makes the dialogue incomprehensible.

I'm a big Nolan fan and really hope this was a theater-specific problem. Can't wait to watch it at home with the subs on.",6ol0kp
dkjaaa3,"I am torn about this one. Big Nolan fan. On one hand I feel like this movie is definitely lacking  character development compare to the usual war movie ( hacksaw ridge, savnig private ryan), lacking an original plot ( inception, memento, presidge). On the other hand, the movie was absolutely gorgeous and there are a lot of memorable scenes that I think will go down in history ( main character holding his ear on the beach while there are bombins coming close to him, torpedos hitting the ships, the flight sequences, soldiers drowning, soldiers covering in fuel oil etc. ). The movie is absolutely beautiful but due to the lack of character dev and a story I feel like something is missing. I am not  saying there is not story, but it is pretty straightforward except for the timeline stuff, other than that, it's just a movie about surviving. I guess if we judge this movie as a war movie, it is new perspective and new story-telling and I would rate it high. If we judge it as a ""Nolan"" film, I am still not quite getting used to the simpleness of this movie. I need to watch a second viewing and some digestion on this one before I can come up with a rating for this film. But if you are into War movies, this is definitely a must-watch and it perfectly captures the loneliness, helplessness and real perspective of war. No bullshit. From start to end, it makes you feel like you are in the war. ",6ol0kp
dkke7b6,"I get it. I see what Nolans intentions were. It made for some great scenes and great sequences and I understand the human element of being stranded and wanting to return home. And its subjective whether the lack of developed characters bothers some of you or not but that's why we watch movies. It's why I watch movies anyways. If it was only about the situation then I could easily go on wikipedia and read about it. The characters. The humanity. The intimate feelings, hopes, and desperation of the men is what interests me and we saw little to none of that. I didn't care about any of the characters because Nolan didn't want us to. It was a very cold and distant film that could have easily been a History channel documentary.",6ol0kp
dkkviqv,"Intense, but cold. I was not allowed to get to know any character well enough to care about their survival (with the possible exception of one...and even then, that character's death was handled with such stiff-upper-lippiness that I figured if the other characters didn't care, neither should I). I liked the pilot character the best (Tom Hardy), but he didn't have any more or less personality than anyone else. I think I just like Tom Hardy.

This movie is skillfully done in every technical department (except sound mixing... come the fuck ON, Nolan! Your audience really ACTUALLY cares about being able to understand dialogue). But in terms of storytelling, it leaves much to be desired. And a lot of that has to do with the fact that the ""ticking clock"" for the Germans to reach and capture the entire British army in Europe wasn't constantly referred to. You never saw the German army (except for ONE blurry shot at the end). You never got the sense that there was any peril of the entire army being captured. There were no scenes with the brave remnants of the French army who held the Germans off until the British army could escape. Without the ticking clock, this movie had no relentlessness. It was just a bunch of scenes cobbled together into a feature film running length. And the constant juttering back and forth in time meant you couldn't simply flow with the story, since you always had to figure out where you were, temporally, in the story.

The fact that Nolan made the deliberate decision to not show the Germans (as people...there were plenty of German planes) is troubling. It was a bad creative decision that removed the most important stakes of the entire Dunkirk operation. Human lives were spent giving the British army time to escape. And it wasn't a lot of time. Yet near zero attention was spent on these two critical points.

Christopher Nolan is a fantastically talented technical director. But I think, with his success established, he's become a bit of a lazy storyteller.",6ol0kp
dkk4tsq,"Americans probably won't notice but they did a shit job hiding anachronistic architectural features. Building's from the 70's/80's, modern street lamps, modern roofing, modern sidewalks, ...

Even though the ultimate goal of Dunkirk is known I had no idea what was going to happen to these characters. The fact you never really see the Nazi's in this makes it even more unnerving. I can barely tell where ANY of those bullets came from throughout the movie.

dkj8jdg,"First of all I must say that I'm a huge Nolan fan so I was quite is excited about this movie when I was going in and I believe that this movie is one of the best war/thriller movies of all time. The score is one of the best that Hans Zimmer has ever done. Cinematography and the production design of this movie was masterful as well, you really do feel like you're in this evacuation when you're watching the movie. Also the performances were great especially Harry Styles was surprisingly good in this movie and I have to say that Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy have done a really good job at their roles albeit the small scale of their roles. Tom Hardy's flight scene at the end of the movie was quite chilling too I literally had goosebumps whilst I was watching that scene. Is it the best movie of Christopher Nolan? The short answer is no however this movie is worth your time and you really have to seek this one out on IMAX because this isn't just a good time on an IMAX theatre it's an experience. As I've just said this movie was amazing and for me its a  10/10. You might be thinking that I'm exaggerating but believe me guys this is quite possibly the best movie of the year.

P.S. For anyone interested in my ranking of all of the Nolan movies here it is

3. Inception

dkouvs0,"The sound in the cinema I went to was way, *way* too loud. Definitely took away from the experience for me. 

Other than that, I share the opinion most people have. Great film, beautifully shot, but had obvious weak spots in its lack of characters (the main characters could all die and I wouldn't have cared at all cause I had zero investment in their fate) and its lack of context. 

It also felt a tad repetitive at times: Man goes on boat, boat gets sunk, man swims to next boat, next boat gets sunk, man swims to other boat, boat gets sunk, etc

I feel like a few shots of the troops holding off the Germans in the city itself could have added to the sense of ""oh fuck time's running out"". 

Ultimately though, one of the better films I have seen this year. Impressive and well made. And hey, that main character was a really good actor given the fact that almost all of his acting had to happen without actually speaking. ",6ol0kp

So I really had high expectations for this movie, and none of them were kept.

There was little to no development of characters, the action scenes were boring, and the movie was very slow paced.

I'm guessing the members of the Church of Nolan are inflating reviews, because everyone I talked to didn't like it, but the internet loves it.

It felt like wasted potential. I could see a good movie lurking in the background, but it never appeared. Left the theaters disappointed, not only by the movie, but that Nolan (a person who's movies I usually enjoy) put out such a bad film.

*This is Nolan's [Kid A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_A).*

Heavy on atmospherics, but still thematically compelling.

Emotionally distant, yet still powerful at conveying the human psyche.

This film is not a crowd pleaser. It's a slow burner about average people in extraordinary situations, no charismatic leads or sentimental backstories here.

What Nolan might have accomplished, instead, is a notable innovation in war film presentation. The soundtrack, cinematography, color grading, etc: All of these complement each other beautifully to elevate an otherwise straightforward script into an immersive experience.

Also the repetitive soundtrack was blaring for 80% of the film and it often overpowered the sparse dialogue that the film did have.

I'm a huge fan of his since The Prestige, and I get what Nolan wanted to do was to just capture the feel as if you were there and the events happening rather than doing a drama film... but at the end of the day it's a movie. It has to do 'movie things' like set up the point of the movie, have a plot, and build up to a climax. There was no setup for the story at the beginning so it became just random events happening (kinda like GOTG2). There was no buildup to the climax when the small boats came. It was like.... gunshots... explosions....tom hardy... explosions... and hey the small boats are here. 

Glad to see other people feel the same as me.",6ol0kp

I got used to all the ""excitement"" and it became ""oh, now this is happening"". It was well filmed and edited, and scored, it was just... emotionless, I guess.

NEUTRAL 

1. More of a survival movie than a war movie IMO

2. The editing was decent but all the time hopping got a little confusing if you ask me. I think the story would've gone better together without time hopping and just played it through. 

3. The ""climax"" was ehhh you had no real idea it was about to happen


GOOD

1. Holy hell the sound was amazing and deserves every award in the book

2. The scenes overall really made you stressed out and I probable aged 3 years from them

3. The acting of the solder on the boat they picked up that was suffering shock was 10/10 


BAD

1. I think they missed a very good opportunity to show the French side of things. The French held the line with there backs against the wall fighting until the very end, knowing that if they failed all the British troops behind them would parish. They decided to not show it at all and only kinda mentioned it. This would've been a great opportunity to show some back against the wall fight to the last man standing type of scene.

2. It didn't feel like there was 300,000 people on that beach when they showed it, maybe 50,000 max

3. You don't feel a real connection to any of the characters 

4. They made it seem like there wasn't much dog fighting but really over 150 + planes got shot down on both sides",6ol0kp
dkjc7sm,"I saw this yesterday and I've given it a lot of thought, so I can finally provide a thought-out opinion of this film.

It is Nolan's best. It is one of the best films I've ever seen. It is the single best cinema-experience I've ever had. And I'm usually not that big of a Nolan-fan (appreciate his films and The Prestige was incredible, but that's usually it).

The film captures the pure essence of survival perfectly. It's not about knowing the characters or their development, it's purely about them making it out alive. The constant fear of death is amazingly portrayed. The film is claustrophobic in its magnitude and provides actual fear for the audience. I was constantly uneasy and thrilled.

Visually it was stunning, and it makes me proud to be Dutch (#TeamHoyte and the waterscenes were in Holland). The acting was solid and the lack of dialogue didn't bother me at all actually. Everything that needed to be said was said imo.

Fionn, Styles and the blonde kid on the boat were amazing in their physical, visual way of portraying their characters who are in a situation noone their age should ever be in. Brannagh, Hardy and Rylance did their jobs as well.

I feel like it was overhyped and it kinda let me down, still think that Inception, Interstellar and Memento are much better movies, opposite of what i read from people saying that it was Nolan's best movie.

**The soundtrack** is great but i feel like it should not be present during the whole movie it takes suspense away because there is always a lot of sound even when nothing important is happening. 7/10

**The cinematography** is incredible, the air shots are breathtaking and the movie makes you feel that you're in there, that being said i think he used too many times the shot of the terrorized/incredulous navy official face on the dock. 9/10

**The story** is not great, we dont have enough time to get to empathize with the characters, at the end he tries to sync up all the stories at once like in Memento but it gets confusing, there was a need for a better build up and he had the time as the film is short with only 106 minutes. 6/10

I saw it in Imax 70mm and holy cow there were some incredibly beautiful shots that added to the overall film. I will definitely be seeing it again and recommend catching it at your theater. ",6ol0kp
dki6c9b,"What really stuck with me after the movie is the portrayal of these ordinary young kids being thrown into an extraordinary situation and how they survived the ordeal. We're so used to seeing every Allies soldier in a World War II movie as this perfect hero, but here it was what I would imagine to be a realistic depiction of young kids thrown into a terrifying situation and how they dealt with it. The direction, score, acting, and scope were all fantastic, but the portrayal of the young soldiers from a new perspective is what will stick with me from this movie.",6ol0kp

dkicjfu,"I went to the first showing, which was at 7PM this evening. The four seats to the left of my were empty, but the next two seats occupied a couple in their young 20s, who felt that it was ok to be on their fucking cell phone throughout the movie!!

I just don't fucking get it. We were also in the ""Prime"" theater, which was better and more expensive than the other screens at the theater. If they cared enough to be at the first showing on the more expensive screen, why did they feel obligated to check Facebook and their texts?! Can you not respect the other people in the theater? Can't you wait until the movie is over? 

I think there is a special run in hell for these people. So fucking obnoxious!

Unfortunately that, and the fact that I had to pee, and I was tired, lowered my enjoyment of the movie. I still thought it was good though, and I am going to try and see it again under better circumstances. 

The biggest problem, as stated by others, was that as tense as it was, it was hard for me to get fully invested into some of the characters. ",6ol0kp

dkie2ns,"About a 7/10 for me.

Quite a few gorgeous shots, Tom Hardy was typically great, the Ticking Clock score was wonderfully effective, the set pieces were mostly great, and the nonlinear structure was just plain exciting to see in a summer war movie.

That said, the sound editing and mixing was terrible. IMAX was plenty loud, but the explosions and gunfire were terrible compared to movies like Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down, and it was impossible to make out about half of the little dialogue there was. And while the ticking part of the score was fantastic, the more traditional score Zimmer uses during scenes like the first transport sinking was grating rather than thrilling. 

Its biggest issue was the editing. While the story structure was interesting, Nolan would have three harrowing event happen at once and did a poor job at juggling them. For example, when the [non-Hardy pilot crashes in the sea and is taking on water, Nolan cuts away two or three times at length, meaning the poor redhead is rapidly sinking for what seemed like ten minutes. I would lose my buzz during the other scene—and I'm fairly sensitive to the horror of drowning while trapped!—only to cut back and have the fella still be on death's doorstep.](#spoiler)

dkina4h,"This is a very well-crafted film. Nolan is one of the only directors working today who is able to get a huge budget and use it wisely. All the technical credits are first rate. The sound of bombs dropping, bullets fired and plane engines are especially solid. The cinematography is gorgeous. There's too many to talk about but some of the shots Hoyte Van Hoytema gets are simply amazing to look at. I also enjoyed how the same soundtrack would flow through different storylines. It worked seamlessly and felt like visual poetry at times.

That being said, the structure didn't always hold up. It was easy to follow the three separate stories but I wish there were mild character development to give them names and some more dialogue. It would've created more investment in them as people. Instead the movie sometimes comes across as just chaos on screen. And while we're on the people, this is the second Nolan movie I've seen that needs help with sound mixing on dialogue. I'm not sure if it was intentional but I was frustrated with the amount of times I could not understand people because of their accents or simply talking too fast.

Overall the experience was worth it. I was lucky enough to see it in 70mm. I'm glad Nolan still finds it worthwhile to use real film as opposed to digital. It's not perfect by any means but the pros heavily outweigh the cons. 9/10",6ol0kp
dkipgai,"It was a great movie, and I found it an impressive film, but I wouldn't go as far as saying it's a masterpiece. It both felt too slow, yet also not long enough. It took me quite a while until I finally felt the tension I was supposed to feel, and I feel like if the movie had been longer, I would've kept that suspense much longer, meanwhile here it felt a bit underwhelming.

Harry Styles did surprisingly well, I had no problem believing everything he said and did, which is quite impressive in itself. I really liked how all storylines started intertwining, but once again it could've all been either a bit more tense earlier on, or faster paced in its entirety. ",6ol0kp
dkivf3h,"I give it 7.5/10 

What I didn't expect was that this movie actually plays more like a horror film than an action movie.  The impending dread and intense sense of hopelessness felt stifling to character development.  There's no clear villainy other than war itself and the characters are almost wooden and just going through the motions.  It's not necessarily the lack of dialogue, more like the incredibly non stop impending dread gave the film no time to allow us to relate to the characters.  The intertwining timelines will make this a great film for re-watching, but it seemed like it just missed the mark on getting you to care more for the characters, I'm also left wondering if the lack of gore had something to do with that.  It was beautifully shot and the costume and set design is amazing and felt incredibly authentic.

I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie, which hasn't happened in a long, long while. The tension never stops.

my confusion? i have some questions:

3) couldn't farrier have guided his plane to land in the sea? i'd have chosen suicide over becoming a prisoner of war. 


4) historically, were any large ships successful in taking its passengers to England? the movie made it seem that the big ships always got bombed bc of their size and largeness in the water


5) how did the smaller ships escape being bombed? because they were smaller and harder to hit bc of their size?

dkmva93,"Dunkirk is an intense, breathtaking experience that I really look forward to seeing again, as I feel it will be very rewarding upon further viewings. The sense of rising tension never really lets up, allowing for some incredibly gripping scenes, the cinematography is fantastic and I really liked how this cast is used. No performance feels show off-y, everyone just feels like they have an important role to play without having to steal a scene. Something as simple as the look of dread on Kenneth Branagh's face is enough to tell you all you need to know. I was also particularly impressed by Harry Styles and the way his role was handled.

If I had to name a flaw it would be that I would have liked to have gotten to know some of the characters a bit more, which might have made it more emotionally involving, besides being about an incredible triumph of the human spirit, something the film does do an excellent job of portraying. I get that Nolan was going for a more minimalist approach and having it not really focus on a particular character, but I did think that a few pay offs towards the end seemed to rely on character development that wasn't really there and would have benefitted from fleshing out some of the characters more. The film is still extremely tense for the fact that we empathise with their situations, which does work but I still would have appreciated a bit more in the character department. 

Overall its a fantastic cinematic experience that left me breathless but very satisfied.",6ol0kp
dkn3jso,"I'm a Nolan fan and a Styles fan so I was very excited to see this. 

I don't feel like it was an all time favourite of mine, but I understand the hype. 

It often felt like I was on a Disneyland ride about the war, and some of the fighter jet scenes felt like a rollercoaster. I didn't see it in IMAX or anything special and it was still extremely immersive so that aspect was awesome.  

I did leave the cinema with a headache. The sound was unbelievable, and the gunshots had me and the other viewers jumping each time. I liked that the sound contributed so much tension and tone, but it did belt my head around a bit. Kinda similar to Birdman in that sense, where I really liked the drum heavy score but I kinda felt like my head had been dunk(irk)ed into a washing machine as well. The score was phenomenal throughout. 

My guess is Nolan wanted to make a film that didn't depend on story? Because there's no story here, it's almost like if Nolan directed an episode of 24, and made the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan into a full length film. 

All of the acting was strong but I wouldn't say any one person stood out. I would say the achievements lie in bringing all elements together so seamlessly and providing rich scenery that felt original (?) for a war film. In particular, the way the ocean was almost a menacing character in itself and the scene toward the end where a ship is tipping onto its side and the ocean appears to ""eat"" the soldiers clinging to it. So well done. 

I'm not a fan of jumbled timelines. I feel like since Lost, TV (and now film) go to these weird lengths to mess around with immediate timelines and tbh I've gotten sick of it. It obviously had its place in a film like Memento but I found myself wondering why there was a need for time displacement in this film. I don't see what it added to anything but I'd be happy to hear someone else's perspective. 

Harry was fine, exactly what I expected. I'm not pseudo shocked that he was good, he's been wanting to act for years now and it was obvious he wasn't going to take a light role. So there were no surprises there and it was fun seeing him on the big screen finally (and on the 7th anniversary of One Direction too). I don't see any awards or whatever for this role but certainly down the road if he ends up carrying a film. 

I think that's my next minor nitpick, no one was given enough screentime to really sink their teeth into a role. Which may have been the point but it left me wanting more. I liked Harry's main scene where he was trying to get someone kicked off the boat but that was it. Similarly with almost every other actor it was like one key scene then they're done. What did Cillian Murphy get to do? One scuffle and some added PTSD then nothing. It doesn't make Dunkirk a bad film but not one I could see myself watching again, simply because there wasn't much to connect to throughout. Which gives you the first hand experience of the soldiers (no time to mourn/get to know anyone/now you're home/go back to your old life etc) but as a *viewer* it wasn't the most rewarding experience. But that's OK, I can appreciate a different approach to viewing cinema. 

These are very minor flaws overall, I still liked the film a lot. I gave it an 8.

EDIT: I forgot to mention, the last few seconds were great. A real juicy meta statement on the pointlessness of war. ",6ol0kp
dkndq8y,"I think I went in with too much hype, see 95% tomato score. I liked the tension produced from the music and the context, but sometimes I was a bit disengaged.

The Spitfire burning then cut back to the kid for like half a second and the roll credits? I just don't get it.

dkigepl,"I was really disappointed in this film. The movie was so uneventful and I felt like the score was a big mistake in this movie. It was so distracting to the point that I couldn't focus on the movie. 

This movie already had minimal dialouge and for whatever small amounts it had I couldn't even understand what they were saying because the background music was so loud and vexing. 

For how ""realistic"" this movie was going for I found it hard to believe that Tom Hardy destroyed so many enemy ships literally by himself. 

The nonlinear timeline was also unnecessary. Unlike in Memento where the nonlinear timeline actually adds to the story and makes it that much more compelling. There was no reason to make this story nonlinear, in fact I found it frustrating how it would just constantly jump from time to time while it did absolutely nothing to add to the film.

On a positive note however, I was really impressed at how good Harry Styles was as an actor. He had quite a lot of dialouge and his character actually felt believable aside from all the other soldiers who were just there to act scared. 

It definitely didn't deserve an absurdly high metascore of 97, but it also wasn't the worst movie in the world. Definitely Nolan's worst film however. I would rate it a 6-7/10",6ol0kp

It didn't have to be like Saving Private Ryan, but there has to be SOMETHING. Anything. The most we got was with the family and the kid on the boat and those were the only scenes where I actually cared about the characters on the screen and what was happening to them or what they were doing  and rooting for them.

But now I realize that the movie just wasn't for me in the first place. I like movies with characters and well-written dialogue, hopefully a varied plot. The lack of the first two, and the plot where basically ""soldiers get on ship, soldiers blasted off ship. repeat"" are very truthful retellings of what happens in a war, and Chris Nolan was going for a very realistic retelling.

dkmjryd,"Honestly? I was pretty disappointed. Let me preface this by saying that it's a good movie. There's nothing wrong with it. The story is good, it's well made, and the sound design is fantastic. It's good.

I wasn't expecting a 2-hour action fest. I wasn't expecting a romanticized retelling of WWII where the Allies can do no wrong and there are heroic, brave men fighting, but I was promised Christopher Nolan's masterpiece and I don't feel like that's what I got. The first 5 minutes set the atmosphere well. Propaganda pamphlets drop from the sky, prompting the British soldiers to abandon hope right before a hail of machine gun fire forces them to flee.

And after that... it just felt sort of generic. It wasn't nearly dreary and hopeless enough to be a gritty retelling, and it wasn't romantic enough to be a mindless action movie. It felt like it was stuck in a limbo of either trying to appeal to the audience and trying to be what Nolan really wanted. One plot point that I found especially egregious was when [the brown haired kid hits his head and dies on the rescue ship.](#spoiler) It felt like an attempt to show that [civilians can be casualties of war](#spoiler) but it just seemed shoehorned in and kind of laughably random. I'd have rather seen a city getting bombed or a few ships sinking or something. It seemed like such a weird example of forced heroism that it completely took me out of it.

dklt3dg,"It's saw Dunkirk on the IMAX in Tulsa.  It was so loud that most people had to put their fingers in their ears.  And I don't mean during firefights or explosions.  Just the background hum and people talking it was so loud.  Every single person I talked to after the movie, young and old couldn't even understand some dialogue because the sound was muffled because it was so loud.
I go to this theatre quite often and see movies on the IMAX and it's usually a tad on the loud side, and I have heard a couple people complain before but most people, like me, prefer it to be a little loud than not loud enough.  But Dunkirk was on a whole different level. The only other movie I've seen on IMAX that was also way too loud was interstellar, another Nolan flick.
I guess I will just refrain from seeing Nolan movies on IMAX in the future, although my daughters friends told me they saw it on a standard 2D screen and it was too loud.  So maybe I'll have to wait for his movies to hit rental.

Don't get me wrong I really loved some aspects of it, like the cinematography was absolutely spectacular, there's something about the color in this movie that gives it an old timey feel, it's just beautiful. And those shots of the spitfires flying in formation or the shot from above of the men lining up on the long beach were absolutely spectacular.
Also the landing of the airplane on the beach at sunset... beautiful.


The film also captures quite well the feeling of helplessness and terror that those people would have felt while trapped on that beach while not going over the top. This is something that not a lot of movies manage to do.


But besides these things (and others that I'm not remembering right now) there's quite a few flaws in my opinion. 


There's practically no storytelling just action here and there.


The scale of the movie was small. There were supposed to be 400 thousand men on the beach but it looked like there were 10 or 20k maximum. Same with the ""civil navy"" there were like 20 of those small boats.


The dogfighting scenes were just frustrating, the guy had the enemy in the sights and waits like 5 seconds, as soon as the enemy moves out of the way he starts shooting. This happened like 3 or 4 times...
And the last fight where, with no engine, he manages to take down the enemy fighter that was coming from behind was just dumb. It would require the enemy aircraft to put himself right in front of him, slow down, and stay there while the spitfire shoots him down.


Also the scene where the main sail boat captain instructs his son to follow his orders. Aligning the boat with the aircraft might make some sense, maybe to minimize the exposure to the fighter since they're going opposite ways. But the ""now!"" part? what the hell did he even do? there was like 1 seconds between him giving the order and the aircraft passing by. A boat like that doesn't react that fast it takes a while for the boat to even start turning. 


I'm not a big fan of the the sound design I can understand why people might like it but for me it's just too minimalist... I don't know how to describe it, it's just the music playing in the background and the noises of whatever is happening like bullets flying or bombs exploding... there's no ambient sound no wind, no sound of waves, no sound of the engine when you're in the cockpit, feels a bit empty. This is for sure a design choice but one that I'm not particularly fond of. Of course other people might enjoy it who am I to say.


The ending was a bit cliche, ""oh I'm ashamed to come home people are gonna hate us"", ""no wait we're actually heroes here's a beer"" like c'mon... 


Overall, it's a good movie but in my opinion it's not really a masterpiece. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this kind of movie today... I don't know.",6ol0kp

dklb9y1,"Not a popular review but:


I didn't like it, thought it was a bit boring. 

Let me preface this by saying in general I don't really like war movies to begin with. But being that this is a Nolan film and praised as ""the greatest war movie ever"", I decided to give it a try. The first half of the movie was just very confusing IMO. there was a lack of story and sense of background/main characters etc. for people who might be unfamiliar with Dunkirk (ie. me). It was great at showing what these people are going through and the emotions behind it but I still felt the story was lacking. I definitely feel like its a movie you watch more than once, and I'm willing to watch it again but as of right now it is the only Nolan movie that I don't really like. 


I'm not saying its a bad movie, but maybe it just isn't for me. ",6ol0kp
dki6kj7,"Very different venture from Nolan. Movie made for the critics. Almost an attempt at Oscar.

Now, I knew what the movie was about and that it was probably going to be much different from Nolan's previous movies. Despite that as a Nolan fan, I wonder if Nolan really had to do a war narrative. His strength lies in story telling. To me he was above oscar bullshit. They were unique in a way only Nolan could do. Dunkirk does not feel Nolan like. It is a war movie that could stand toe to toe with other good war movies, but nothing above them. Makes you feel anyone else could have taken them.",6ol0kp
dklk4wy,"Very good. It's not as perfect as the reviews are saying, but definitely very high quality. For a summer blockbuster, it really pulled through. The cinematography was stunning, and it was expertly paced. I did have some issues:

I thought the casting of Harry Styles was very odd. The whole movie promotes this theme that there's no real ""hero"" in this movie, especially with the soldiers on land. By having a big-name celebrity be one of our ""nameless soldiers,"" it kind of brought me out of the movie for a second. All the other characters I recognized because of subtler things, where as Harry Styles was... Harry Styles. In a movie all about the massive impact of this event, it was kind of contradictory to have a big-name celebrity be one of its faces. I get that it also had Hardy and other big names like Rylance or Murphy, but they had more distinct characters whereas Styles was more or a ""representation of a whole"". This might just be a personal thing, but a thing nonetheless.

The Sound mixing for this movie was a double-edged sword. The big booms of the torpedoes and crashing ships sounded amazing, and the bullet fire made me jump on several occasions. However, it and the soundtrack were so loud at times, that the dialogue was hard to distinguish. I missed a lot of key lines in the boat target practice scene, so I I was trying to put together a lot of the pieces that I missed because I couldn't understand a word they were saying. With that in mind, however, it was a smart choice from Nolan to have very little dialogue. I couldn't lose the dialogue if there isn't any.

Also, the ending with Hardy felt a little corny. Shooting down the enemy plane and then flying into enemy territory didn't work for me. Couldn't he have let his parachute out?

Overall though, I thought it was very good and would recommend the movie. It's easy to see how polarizing it is with some people: It's not a character driven movie, and is more about getting emotion across than complex dialogue or characters. I read a review that called it an impressionistic movie, and that hits it right on the nose. Everything is made to serve the images it is trying to express, and Nolan definitely pulled off his vision.

So I went to the premiere of the film and it was a Rendy V. Fangirl experience....it was something. It was a mess. A total mess. Friggin girls w/o tix camped out for two nights and waited for the red carpet to start so they can see Harry. I went to one Nolan premiere and it was Interstellar and it was a lot of fun where I got to meet so many people including this amazing [pic of Anne Hathaway and I.](https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/1457756_885463024827844_107709076312455419_n.jpg?oh=f9d6280d67198606a6a79704104f602f&oe=59F236D2)

What Nolan does so perfectly in my eyes is how he’s able to captivate his audience through his visual framework, immersing them into his world. In a modern age where nearly every movie is filmed in digital, people consider any director who decides to shoot in an old school millimeter format is criticized as being ambitious. Quentin Tarantino recently did it with The Hateful Eight, and it worked in his benefit as that film played as an homage to western films of the 60s in its style and its aesthetic. At first, you question why Dunkirk is filmed this way, but then you realize he's going for the 50s style cinematography. There is a handful of establishing shots where the frame can be mistaken for a 50s movie or a cinematic newsreel that played at the early age of cinema. In regards to effects and craftsmanship, I consider this film more of a war epic version of Ben-Hur.
It may be only July, but I feel this has a long lasting power to next year’s Oscars going against Baby Driver in the sound categories. I don’t notice the usage of sound that much when viewing a film, but this and Baby Driver are two of the only films of this year (so far) that made me both notice its usage but also fascinate me of how it's utilized.

If it's not the sounds of explosions moving you, then it's the electrifying score of Hans Zimmer. Zimmer commands an orchestrated army of violinists throughout the entire movie. Just the chords that are played have you at the edge of your seat. Even when a character is just walking, that violin chord plays at a rapid speed just gripping you. This is the type of music that I would play anytime I would have to deal with the MTA when my trains are delayed as I anticipate it to come through my station. Nolan may be the boss, but Zimmer is the God. Honestly, this is hands down one of the best scores he’s ever composed right up there with Man of Steel.

dkici6s,"Just wonderful. The slow buildup and the intertwining of the timelines was incredible. So many climactic moments. 

I found it fascinating that after the first bombing run, the soldiers assembled back in order, depicting the almost routine reaction to bombing. Contrast with the reaction to the bombers from the wounded boat and the end, when you end up terrified that the rescue will be jeopardized.

For the audience, sheer terror every time you began hearing the planes. Masterful audio work. ",6ol0kp
dkie2ll,"Barely any plot or emotional connection to the charachters. But seemed like that was what Nolan was going for. Looked amazing and it had my heart pounding from the first frame to the last. 
Would probably say this is the greatest reenactment movie I have ever seen. Great tension and Nolan really makes you feel like you are there on the beach, in the sky or on the boat with them. Not the greatest war movie though. 

Probably one of the better movies this year.",6ol0kp
dkiex5c,"It was a spectacular movie, but I don't understand how everyone is saying it's Nolan's best. The Prestige, Memento, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight are all better than this film, in my opinion. Either way, definitely one of the better films released this year.",6ol0kp
dkioln5,"Really enjoyed the movie. Nolan is a masterful director. I don't know that anyone else would have tried to make a war movie that comes off more as a documentary than what you'd typically expect from a modern blockbuster war movie. Amazing cinematography and sound. Nothing felt over done or overplayed to sell the moment, yet all the moments were sold through all the same. 

I will say that I was shocked that he didn't use the pressing Germans more to ramp up the tension, but that shows how good he is. I still found myself sitting on the edge of my seat for a good 30 minute stretch at the end. ",6ol0kp

dkiq2v2,"Saw Dunkirk last night with my wife and we both were immersed in this film. I have a different perspective now on water after seeing multiple sinking ships in this duration. I uttered a silent wow to myself early on in the film when the dog fights began to take place. It was awesome and for a minute, felt like I was back on the water planet in interstellar. I turned with the camera on the planes and it was quite surreal. 

Some things I noticed that stood out most-

Cilian Murphy once mentioned he wished the dream sequence in inception had a beach instead of a mountain complex. This time around in Dunkirk, it...sort of came to floruishion but he was beside himself based on the events he faced. 

While I won't compare the emotions of war to the emotions of space, Dunkirk for me was....not as powerful in terms of the raw emotion in Interstellar. Even after Interstellar ended I was wiping tears away. Though What happened with George in Dunkirk did it in for me that was not what Cilian Murphy intended for in his character. He was just too frightened by the thought of going back to hell. 

The film had a lot of notable IMAX segments compared to the film and I am making this a must see in IMAX. I saw the encore presentation of Interstellar in IMAX and it was the greatest movie experience I have ever witnessed, even after seeing it three times prior. 

I felt like the music had a subtle mix of Nolans prior movies- Memento came to mind during Dunkirk (when Lenny is beginning to unfold (that constant dun dun) ) really cool if you noticed that.

Speaking of sound I was quite surprised at how well the sound was in our theatre. Read a lot into this that viewers were often troubled by how loud it was. The opening scene is all I need to say because the rest of the film had the same level of sound quality. 

I don't know why but for the life of me, I thought Tom Hardy was a German pilot based on his presumed accent with the oxygen mask on. I was completely surprised by his performance towards the end. Very well acted.

",6ol0kp
dkivoxf,"Okay. I really liked it but I wanted to really love it.

The 70mm IMAX experience was definitely something to behold. I will always appreciate Nolan choosing to shoot movies this way.

The sound design and cinematography should probably win Oscars.

The action was of course really good.

Cons

The entire narrative structure of the time jumping and three POVS was a little disorienting. I can usually handle this type of stuff but towards the end it got really jumbled even for me. The climatic ""THE LITTLE BOATS HAVE ARRIVED"" moment happened way before the actual climax should have IMO.  Would have appreciated a more straight forward storytelling approach. Thought it would have served the suspension more. 

The gore. There should have been way more of it. I'm sorry I know it was aiming for PG 13 but for a movie wanting to ""take you into the experience of war"" having almost ZERO blood and guts was really immersion breaking. 

Some of the dialogue (the little there is) is kinda too on the nose. Even for a Nolan film. 

Personal dumb quibble, I have a problem understanding english accents and this movie was really hard for me to understand the little subtle dialogue moments. 

All in all I'm not sure this movie really holds up WITHOUT the large format experience. It's definitely something that SHOULD be experienced in 70mm IMAX but it's not a movie I'll be racing to buy for a home release.

Personal Nolan rankings
1. The Dark Knight - Perfection
2. Inception - Near perfection
3. Batman Begins - Amazing
4. Dark Knight Rises - Quite good
5. Prestige - Quite good
6. Dunkirk - Good
7. Interstellar - Okay

I can honestly say, the more you watch it, the more it makes sense and easier it gets to piece everything together.

dkkqj0v,"Saw it last night...enjoyed it, but felt like a few more layers were missing.  Maybe it's because the film stripped away cliches we're used to (character's backstories, etc) but the film still somehow felt incomplete to me...Like it needed 5-10 minutes in the beginning to set everything up and then I would've been more invested.

Hard to criticize the film though - incredible editing, realistic fight scenes, really captured the psychological horror of war that many war movies turn into operatic theatre rather than pure animal terror.

However I couldn't help but feel like I wanted one more layer of action back on the beach.  I never really felt like there were 400,000 men stuck on the beach, and I would've liked a story following the boredom and terror of the people who couldn't move anywhere, and were forced to share limited resources with hundreds of thousands of other men.

Last - the ending left me really cold.  I understand what Dunkirk means to England, but it felt like a an odd statement for an intelligent filmmaker to make in 2017...certainly ideas about patriotism and national resolve are a *part* of the reason that world tragedies like Dunkirk happen?  The whole film leading up to those moments seem to realistically capture war in all of its naked horror - then in the last moments the film seems to suggest it's all worth it if the cause is right.  To me that makes the previous 2 hrs a bit more of a war memorial than I'd like it to be - but that's just my personal political preferences.",6ol0kp

 Although I enjoyed it, I don't see myself watching it multiple times like many of Nolan's other films. I feel i've absorbed enough of it in one run to understand everything about it, unlike something like Interstellar or Inception where you benefit from watching it numerous times (for obvious reasons, they're mind benders.. not historical films). Felt the same about Hacksaw Ridge, loved it, but haven't touched it since. ",6ol0kp

Score - 6.5/10, Zimmer and Nolan bold as usual, but parts of it felt labored and overdone.

Plot - 8/10, loved the historicity; to those who sought more individual character development, I understand but I think Nolan's genius here was leaving it out. This was about 400k men collectively, not one. Brilliant tension throughout.

Directing - it's Nolan, what more is there left to say

Overall - 9/10

dkvnipu,"The Spitfire gunfire always seemed way too late to actually hit their moving target. Didn't seem like they were leading the shots enough.

The dialog and dogfight maneuvers make it clear that the pilots are trying to lead their shots. I keep waiting for the gunshot burst to go off... and waiting... and waiting... and then *just* before the BF-109 is in the crosshairs I finally hear it. I'm expecting the burst well before the target is in their sights.

But I'm basing this primarily off of dogfights in Battlefield 1942, haha. (which I now really want to play... Battle of Britain...) Curious if others thought the same, or if anyone wants to tell me that the shooting timing in this movie was more realistic than I'm giving it credit for.

I watched the movie without seeing any trailers for it, and honestly there was nothing bad about it but there weren't that many high points.

The soundtrack was forgettable; I'm not the biggest Zimmer fan and I don't remember a single memorable piece from the movie. I feel like if I saw the movie through Nolan's eyes, in the way he intended his audience to see the movie, I would have liked it more.

It opened with that really cool shot of the street with all the papers coming down and followed the boys running for their lives to reach the beach. Every single one of them dies except for our main character boy. I get that people die in war and there were probably some situations like this, but it sort of took me slightly out of it for a bit at the beginning. Just the sheer implausibility that our guy is the only one to survive, do you really need to start the movie with that?Whatever, still cool. But then theres the whole scene where they find a wounded man and need to rush him to the boat. They're running on the beach, cut, Branaugh standing by boat, cut running on beach, cut explosion, cut beach, Branagh, beach, boys, running. This shit goes on for a couples minutes and is the first big sequence. Can someone tell me why this scene was not just a useless piece of suspense for the sake of it. Great they have to get to the boat, oh no its going to leave run faster. I've seen this shit a million times before and it was simply boring. The dog-fighting scenes could have been better. 

Also the scene where they are in the beach boat getting shot at. ""Oh theres water coming into the boat, go put your fucking face in front of the holes bitch lol surely you won't get shot"" Guess you could explain that with stupid kids/ fog of war. Whatever.

Yeah ok the clock thing creates a sense of time and suspense and shit. Not like no one has used this effect before, so what if its incorporated through the whole time its the same shit.

dkjwd9o,"Just saw Dunkirk in 70mm at a domed IMAX theater. 

I'm not seeing what other people are, but I'm trying to see the other side. The non-linear storytelling was a interesting device, but the film (to me) was completely neutered by the lack of blood and realistic violence. I'm not looking for a torture porn war movie, but come on, if it wants us to be miserable and believe the slaughter, it needs to be brutal and visceral.

Also, I couldn't stand the score. I'm fine with no real character story and no heart string pulling (for the most part, the boy on the boat is a massive exception). But the combination of the extreme close ups with the high pitched strings and quick panoramic cuts was extremely off putting.

Dunkirk doesn't. It shows hundreds die, it shows the brutality of drowning in a sinking ship, it shows men turn on each other to survive, and while it has heroism in it, it is never the point of the film.

I'm just blown away. This deserves best picture.",6ol0kp
dkpbhho,"
This was easily the best film of the year, the best film by Christopher Nolan and the best war film that I've ever seen. The way it utilised tension over violence to tell the story was a stroke of genius from Nolan, and the storytelling from 3 perspectives was absolutely brilliant. The way he weaved them all together and they slowly culminated together at the end was magnificent, and the little touches, like Farrier thinking Collins was fine when he waved, but actually he was trying to get out of the cockpit, or when 'Shivering Soldier' was shown leaving the soldiers behind on a boat in an earlier sequence, were just cherries on top of the heavily iced cake. Tom Hardy fucking blew me away with his performance, he's never been my favourite actor, but he literally acted the whole way through with just his eyes. He brought out an emotional, heroic performance, with just his eyes..fuck me. The entire cast was spectacular, I wasn't distracted by poorly acted extras or anything like that, and special credit should go to Kenneth Branagh, the way his eyes began to tear up when he saw the Brits was wonderful, it wasn't at all over-the-top. Nolan and the ensemble cast perfectly evoked a 'show don't tell' story that was incredibly impressive. Furthermore, visually it was wonderful.
The shots, bobbing up and down underwater, and shaking at times, made for a very visceral experience. Similarly, the beautiful shots from Hoytema immersed me in the experience. The real sets, locations and ships/planes used really put me in the war, as did the stunning visual effects. Now we come on to the score by Hans Zimmer, in my opinion one of his best, one that's sole purpose was to further the emotions evoked by the film already. The constant ticking clock was super intense, and I especially loved the music over the dogfights. The usage of Elgar's Enigma variations at the end was also a great heroic end to the piece. All in all, it was one of the best experiences I've had in a film. It was easily the tensest film I've seen, having me on edge and genuinely shocked at times. I also good goosebumps at least 3 times, which has never happened to me in a film before. Cannot pick anything wrong from it, a perfect movie that I'm super pumped to rewatch sometime.",6ol0kp

After I left the movie I looked at my girlfriend and said, ""Do you even remember anyones name from that movie?"" and all we came up with was George. That's an issue.

Watched it digital, not a 70mm showing. The movie stuttered like 3 times, like when you're streaming a movie and it's buffering, WTF. (My theater fault). But really it feels too ""sharp"", especially the Dunkirk part at the beginning, it feels fake. Like if I went to Dunkirk today and shot a movie which would take place now. 

Regarding the timelines, I didn't really ""paid attention"" more than usual. At the beginning, it's quickly shown ""a week"", ""a day"" and an ""one hour"" but since they all met at the end it wasn't confusing at all, not a mindfuck or anything like that like I could have expected/have heard.

The music/sound design was really good ! One music in particular had a rhythm like a slow breathe awaiting for something to happen. It was loud though. (interstellar being the loudest movie I ever heard before (pain inducing loud), this is like the second loudest).

The ""feeling of struggle"" was well done, like [the first boat got attacked and they were all stuck in that boat under water, or when the fisherman boat was shot at by the germans on the beach.](#spoiler)",6ol0kp

dkk4gf2,I dunno. I wasn't much of a fan of this one. I get why people like it though. The 3 different stories were a bit hard to get into at times.

dkl41qj,"I'm going to to take a contrary position to most and say this was a decent movie but not a great one. I personally dislike the multiple timelines converging and I think the story could have been better told in a linear fashion.  Given that the air part was one hour, they should have done segments feeding into each other then given half the movie to the air portion that ended up being the strongest part of the story in tandem with the sailboat. 

I think this was an epic movie but I didn't connect with the majority of the characters, which meant a lot of time spent building to the obvious conclusions. Saving Private Ryan, Hacksaw Ridge and the two Iwo Jima movies were better because I connected with the individuals being followed. ",6ol0kp
dklasq3,"Does anyone else think the PG-13 rating took away from the impact of the film? Nolan basically compensates for the lack of blood in his movies with gunshot noises 3 times louder than in any other movie.

Even WWII veterans complained, saying the movie was much louder than the evacuation in real life. The PG-13 editing also made the [boat head injury](#spoiler) scene less impactful.

There were no viseral scenes like in Saving Private Ryan where a guy is picking up a severed limb, or Vin Diesel wants a letter to get to his dad.

dkihm9d,"""Dunkirk"" is a dramatic film by Christopher Nolan about the evacuation of the titled French city. The film is in your face and abrupt. Nolan tells his story through three distinct points of views, a beached soldier, a fighter pilot, and a civilian boater. The desperation in each POV can be felt by the viewer, and scenes become progressively tense as the movie goes on. However, there is a delightful message about patriotism, hope, and humanity at the end. One must be warned to be very attentive as the timeline differs from each main character's perspective. The music compliments the film well by immersing the audience in the action. Overall, ""Dunkirk"" is a must see film on the big screen. See it twice to get a clearer understanding of the timeline.

Maybe it was the fewest speech movie I've ever seen. Nolan didn't mention backround of the characters too much. When I watched its trailer, I expected more action scenes but although Fionn Whitehead performed weakly and the movie consists of less of action scenes apart from bombed war ships and gone down the german planes and pursuit of spitfires, I can say I loved that. Rather than Fionn Whitehead, Mark Rylance was leading actor as event happens events around him.

dki7te7,"DUNKIRK SPOILER FREE

Pretty great movie and more grounded (heh) shall we say than Nolan's last outing in Interstellar. There really isn't much talking at all in this film and this is to its benefit because it focuses our attention on Dunkirk the event and not the characters per say. We get this tangible feeling of what Dunkirk as a historical moment was, and not what any singular persons experience with it was. Of course we follow certain characters in the navy, army and airforce but their experiences together combine to give us the scope of the event. In this case it sacrifices a little realism, as some characters face an almost absurd amount of difficulty, but that is forgiven because its clearly trying to accomplish the scope through the lens of these characters. The three narratives are all woven together very neatly and underscored by an extremely tense soundtrack punctuated by LOUD (seriously this might be the loudest film ive ever heard at points) diegetic explosions and gunfire. I cannot emphasise this enough: the film is extraordinarily tense, like horror film levels. The most unfortunate thing about the film is that Nolan once again cannot help himself with sappy as fuck comments that would be more at home in someone like Brett Ratners schlock. Kenneth Branagh character in particular. Other weak points would be how they dealt with some scenes regarding the army characters we follow as they are heavy handed as well. Also this is just personal but I'd have really loved some more better iconography in this film. I mean there are some beautiful shots but there were none that were especially new and WW2 has so many good opportunities for this and i kinda hoped Nolan coulda done more of that.

GOOD:
- The tone of the film is impeccable and very consistent
- The score
- The acting (even Harry Styles who I was very ready to hate)
- Some of the more interesting shots, particularly the ships sinking 

SEMI SPOILER GOODS:
- The fact we never see the enemys face makes it much more thrilling 
- I enjoyed the main army characters journey the most, he provided the bulk of the bleak grounding of the film
- When some things just happen and have little attention paid to them like the first planes disappearance or the very opening scene and the 6/7 people dying 

SEMI SPOILER NOT SO GOOD:
- He just couldn't help himself with some cliched lines (especially the repeated focus on home by Kenneth)
- Good cinematography but not as iconic as it could have been. The shots on the beach are the best examples of the good. 
- The civilian boat is just not that interesting a story and could've been cut down considerably. 

Overall I'd give it 4/5 on my first viewing. Very good. ",6ol0kp

On the other hand, if it was done proper, it would be a long ass movie without the tight pace that this has, which is the intention all along.

It had a lot of great or interesting moments, both in story and its telling, but they never really coalesced into anything more. I really wanted to *love* the film.

However, I found that nothing quite evoked the emotion that I thought it would bring. No certain dread or whatever. I guess I had higher expectations because of the trailer. It was quite solemn throughout it. Another thing was that I didn't feel attached to any one character, although perhaps that was the point. There's no fluff in the movie and it's quite straightforward.

dkjp194,"So just got back from seeing it in IMAX (holy fuck the sound was insane) and I enjoyed it but the multiple time line shit annoyed me. This is a war film, Nolan, it isn't Memento or Pulp Fiction! He made time the focus of the film from how little they had, to how long it actually took to load people onto boats, and then the set backs. But then he'd switch from a day scene to a night scenes right back to a day scene. So I'm all worried about how much fuel Tom Hardy has left showing he's burning through about 10 liters in 20 minutes, then it's night all of a sudden, right back to day time and he's only down 20 liters?!?! That shit just ruined all the tension build up he spent the first half of the film on. I mean the movie starts with a ticking time clock in the soundtrack. And the music sounded like plane engines so you never actually knew when it was the music or actual planes incoming. All that brilliance only for the second half of the movie become this turducken of a timeline. 

I will say though, the dog fights were so good and so intense I'm wishing for a Battle of Britain movie.   ",6ol0kp

Tom Hardy is low of fuel, the stories are intersecting and in the distance he sees a wing of bombers and escorts. Like 10-15 planes. He makes a daring move knowing he will die and just in time a wing of spitfires come in out of nowhere. 

It's cliche but I LOVED the air combat parts and just felt the climax was lacking. I know it was all about emotion but I really think there's a way to make it both emotional and action exciting. The planes scenes were shot so well and sounded amazing I guess I just wanted more. ",6ol0kp
dkv3c7d,"Just got back from watching it. Didn't watch it in imax, so wasn't impressed by anything visually, although it was shot very well. I can't wait to see it in 4k.

Everyone keeps talking about these moments they had, but I never felt any of them. I don't know what it was, but nothing in this movie had impact on me like in other recent war films. Maybe watching it in a regular theatre ruined it for me?

I didn't really realise there was 3 different time lines until they all converged. 

I did like how he made the isolation come out and feel real. But I never felt like they were really pressured. Honestly it looked like if the British had just sent 3 more planes, the whole thing would have been a non-issue.

Theres a scene where the beach gets bombed, people are blown up, then everyone just files back into line like nothing happened. No one even looks towards any wounded, theres no screaming or crying or panic. 

When I watched Hacksaw Ridge for the first time at home, I was swearing at the screen when shit happened, on the edge of my seat, I actually had to take a break at one point.

Sure, it didn't go in-depth into the characters but at the same time it didn't need to.  I thought all the characters had their purpose and the sum of it all was a compelling portrayal of a vital part of WWII.

My only point of criticism is that the character of George honestly felt unnecessary and heavy-handed.  It felt like he was there to show civilian sacrifice but he literally died by falling down some stairs.  I understand you can hit your head and cause damage but I feel like the chances of him actually dying from that had to have been extremely low.",6ol0kp

dki71wx,"Nolan you genius. Some of the aerial shots of the water with the planes or even the boats were glorious. And I never been so anxious in a movie. When he was reading the famous Churchill speech in the newspaper towards the end ""We shall fight on the beaches...."" there were SOO many people who teared up. 

EDIT - The dialogue was mumbled at times but tbh they didn't add a lot to the movie anyway. The sound and cinematography were the real champions.",6ol0kp
dki7j7h,"I absolutely LOVE how loud this movie is. I feel like a lot of people dont have a concept of how loud guns are. Shooting an AR-15/M-16 at a (especially indoor) range without hearing protection will 1) be painful and 2) cause some permanent hearing loss. That was the first thing that really stood out to me when I first started firing guns. Not the recoil, but the sheer loudness of it.

The movie's sound is the fantasic defining feature of this film in that regard. Its loud and disorienting. It catches you out of nowhere at times, and indeed likes the characters can make you slightly nervous waiting for it. The boat scene with ""target practice""  exemplifies this the most. When the rounds hit, you feel it. Its sharp, its terrifying. The silence between the piecing shots are ones of anxiety waiting for the inevitable to come again, yet despite knowing its coming, the sound still catches you in your gut.

The sound was great though, almost defaning at times, and is one of the first movies I've seen that really seems to capture the feeling of gunfire.

dkidacw,"First song I'm throwing on in my car as I'm leaving the theatre? Time - Pink Floyd

dkie0sx,"I'll start by saying I don't know if anyone alive today can make a film of this scope, and so practically at that. The shots are absolutely breathtaking, and Nolan's talent to clearly capture action truly shines. Not only was his visual scope incredible, but even the timeline Nolan used in the story was astounding. I'll admit, it took me a while to fully catch onto the timeline of the events, but I think this approach makes the experience disorientating and somewhat confusing as an audience member, as I imagine it also was for the soldiers involved in the events at Dunkirk. 

Felt like Nolan also took a page out of Kubrick's book with his emphasis on the sound of war. Too often I think war, and action sequences underplay the sounds of gunfire and explosions. I recently saw Full Metal Jacket and theaters and noticed how loud Kubrick set the levels on the gunfire, and that's exactly how Nolan handled the sounds of war. The sounds of the planes were absolutely chilling every time they screeched across the screen, and the gunfire and explosions were deafening. This immersion in sound causes a panic while you're watching the movie, almost placing you in these terrifying war sequences. The ongoing ticking also didn't fail to keep me on the edge of my seat. All of this experimentation with a constant noise made any silence in the final scenes absolutely chilling. The moment Tom Harry's plane coasted across the screen in silence I honestly teared up, because it was an absolutely breathtaking moment. 

And you've gotta love that small sound of the crinkling paper in the silence of security at the end. ",6ol0kp

There weren't enough ooh and ahh moments for me.  I totally get the direction he was trying to go for this movie, but I feel like Nolan was going for more of an ode to the past rather than making a blockbuster film, which is totally fine.  But it just felt empty.  It felt like a collection of shots rather than a movie.",6ol0kp

dkig076,"Just saw it.  Enjoyed it very much but not my favorite Nolan movie by a stretch.   This was a really well done (based on my limited knowledge) homage/reenactment of the events: the music and ""loudness"" of the planes really drew me into the action from the very beginning. 

I think that at the cost of maintaining this focus on reenacting the events, story and character development took a hit.  War movies are one of my favorite genres, and part of why I love them so much is the chance to show how people respond and grow emotionally even in the midst of a war.  We got glimpses into all of the characters but if we hold this against some of the most iconic war movies out there, it falls short in that department.  

Other notes...soundtrack was great but it was difficult to hear. I think everyone acted their pants off (even Harry Styles!). The theme of British resiliency - down to the average citizen ""doing their part"" - stood out to me as well.

I enjoyed the movie just as much the 2nd time around. It was nice being able to pick up little things I may have missed on first viewing & things other Redditors pointed out in discussions last night. My favorite scenes are still the aerial shots/dogfights. Still got chills on Hardy's last scene flying over the troops. 

Fantastic movie and must see in theaters. 70mm if you get the chance. No theater near me is showing 70mm IMAX combo which I'm sad to miss. Also, DBOX was great but I don't recommend it for your first viewing just because it can be distracting at times.

I enjoyed following Gibson's character and then it looked like the boys he saved, or rather Alex turned against him in the boat...asked him to get out to stop them sinking..just because he was a 'german spy' and then simply just French.

dkksn1l,"[Spoilers] Two plot issues I'm having trouble resolving:

1. When Ferrier's plane runs out of fuel, he is still over the Allied section of the beach. He opens his cockpit as if to parachute out, but then closes it back up, and proceeds to land the plane outside the Allied perimeter, set it on fire, and wait to be captured. As a determined and resourceful soldier, why would he choose to essentially give up without attempting to parachute into safety? If he was going to destroy the plane anyway, why not bail out, let the plane crash away from Allied troops, which was possible, and live to fight another day?

2. While below deck on the beached ship, Alex threatens Gibson at gun point to leave the boat, and also basically turns on Tommy in the process. Alex shows that he's not a good person, and willing to sacrifice others to save himself. Yet by the end of the film, Alex and Tommy are still friends, as if that betrayal had never happened. Also, as an audience member, I'm supposed to find Alex sympathetic at the end, yet he's proven to be a total douche. Why was his big freak-out in the grounded ship disregarded?",6ol0kp

That all being said, really great movie. I wouldn't say it's one of the *best* war movies ever made *yet*, but I do wanna see it again pretty soon. The sound work really stood out to me. People in here are complaining (but also praising) how loud it is, and I think it made the movie about 10x better. Really incredible shit.

dl2c36m,"I thought that the movie had some really strong points but there is also a couple of bad points witch brings the movie down. The movie is good and I gave it a 6/10 and here is why.

The thing that drags the movie down is that the characters had to litle dialog and that the movie is repedetive. In the movie the characters have very litle dialog and when they sart to say something was something that I relly liked beacuse it gave the movie more to the characters, but sadly it didn't. 

Secondly was the repedetivenes where there was [alot of ships getting destroid and airships that crasch and is getting shot at. The most intresting battleground was on the beach were everyone was helpless.](#spoilers)

Apparently Tom Hardy was a pilot in this move. There is no reason why beacuse he's in a airship, whit a mask and this is a scilent movie so why spend money on someone that we doesn't notice is there.

These were just the problems there is a lot of intence and beatiful imegry that gives the movie life. The acting is very good but then again they have to litle character, I wanted more.",6ol0kp

dkpp3ha,"This movie took an absolute dump on the actual story of Dunkirk. 1/10.

I don't even know where to begin, so let's start a list.

*  The movie failed to establish anything near the scale of the real battle.

*  Many important details were left out, such as the fact that the channel was covered in mines.

* The stakes weren't established.  How many planes were there?  How many boats?  How was the beachfront held?

That's all that pertains to historical details, but that's not where the flaws end.  Sound design was also terrible.  The music was just a godawful buzzing noise with massive amounts of bass being dropped in any action... not that you could hear it over the gunfire and whatnot, compared to anything else out right now, like Baby Driver, this movie ***sounded*** like nails on a chalkboard.  Characters hardly ever spoke, which was probably for the best because you couldn't understand the words coming out of their mouth.  The moments of silence were a blessing.

As for the movie itself, it was god-awfully boring.  It was just repetition over and over of soldiers getting in a boat, the boat being sunk, and then soldiers getting in another boat.  I'm pretty sure Christopher Nolan took 15 minutes of footage and replayed it 5 times by accident and the editors left it in.

There was no action that actually felt intense as a war movie should.  Maybe that has more to do with the subject material rather than the director.  I think the movie might actually be enjoyable if it started earlier in the retreat and followed the perimeter as it got tighter and tighter, ending in the army being saved in the nick of time by the boats in the end as a huge payoff instead of just menial build-up.  Or maybe if we watched the French fighting back.  The opening scene of infantry combat led me to believe that this would be a completely different movie.

As for the cinematography, I don't think it was anything special.  Though it was probably the best part.  It was all gray-scale or blue-scale, which made the movie look (and feel) like a Battlefield 3 loading screen.

Edit: How does this garbage movie have a higher RT than Saving Private Ryan?",6ol0kp

dkovupz,"This movie is so undeserving of a 95+ from any outlet. 

It is my least favorite Nolan film, and totally forgettable as war films go. The stylistic choices (no blood, no gore) utterly rob the film of any sense of impact or cost to what you see play out on screen.

The 6 minutes shown before Rogue One was a MUCH more enjoyable ride than this feature length movie. Dunkirk should be reworked as a short film, because it has much more to offer in that format.

The total lack of showing of ""The enemy"", and only referring to them as such felt sterile and unreal. 

I could go on for an hour about every single missed opportunity that this movie squandered, and why it should not have been played out as some kind of half-hearted Nolanverse version of World War 2. 

Just truly, truly saddening. ",6ol0kp
dki762x,"A lot of people are complaining there were no ""main"" characters, not enough character development, etc.

I prefer there not being a single or couple of main characters in a movie about war like this. The story is what you're there for - it's already a very tight, specific plot - and if you say you didn't feel anything for the seemingly hopeless and doomed lives of the soldiers then I feel like you missed the point.

What I took away from this is the humanity. The kindness and bravery of the civilians and the pilots, of the nurses on the ships, of the petrified young men who managed to work together even though they were probably shitting themselves and face to face with death.

It sucked. Nolan is good, dark Knight was great, and Dunkirk sucked like a stray bullet hole sucking ocean through carrier hull. Thinking on it, it was either the lack of characters, lack of story, or both. You need to care about what happens to the characters. There were no actual main characters and nothing even really happened. My guess is that Nolan went 'experimental' or artsy with this one, and since it's Nolan, he is granted freedom and none of the execs are there to pull his head out of his ass to actually make an entertaining movie. To all those comparing this to saving Private Ryan - dear Lord. Like comparing analyze this to the godfather. Not even in the same Galaxy.

The movie was about as repetitive in sequence as a conveyor belt moving across a factory line. every scene looks blandishly the same to the next. a slow crawl into boredom and ominous sound design that leaves you wanting to claw your ears off. There was no solid story, no solid character arcs... just the threat of germans, and the need for evacuation. The emotions in this movie were so minimal i wanted to cry: e.i when a certain boy died on the boat.... everyone was so fucking nonchalant... like okay whatever. Tom hardy shooting down planes and missing and little to no frustration shown or care. I honestly could barely 'bare' to watch this movie..... It was like crawling into a moldy pantry in the undertow of a boat and being force fed stale moldy bread for an hour and half. BLEH! The dialogue was also extremely minimal almost no in depth discussions about family, or back home... or they went through... i can understand maybe they were all 'defeated' in more than one sense... but for a movie of this length little to no dialogue is hard to swallow. The only good thing about this movie was the occasional cinematographic sequence that was interesting.... but they were so rare in occurrence that it honestly was mostly just gray overdrop and shots of ocean for 85% percent of the film. Honestly its hard to give this movie anything above a 4/10. Between the screeching music, the repetitive scenes and ideas, the lack of dialogue and emotion, and the overall almost non existent plot and character building it's safe to say that everyone that's giving this movie high ratings is out of there mind! 95%!??!?!?!? saving private ryan was at 90% on metacritic... to call this movie in the same league or even better is beyond me.

Couldn't tell one soldier from another. 

Blood washing up on the beach with that foam woulda made a great visual. But Nolan wanted that PG money for investors not art. 

The boat practice scene was tense but played too long with hardly any real lasting outcome.

Why did we not get to see more of what happened to Cilian Murphy's character to make him so shell-shocked? Why did the central soldier character befriend Harry Styles at the end even though he was a prick who caused the death of his french friend? Why did the kid go blind and die--it's like he just fell or something. Why did the other kid not make a bigger deal out of this soldier killing his fucking innocent civilian teenager friend? With so little dialogue you'd think Nolan wouldn't repeat the same ""home"" line like three times while a character looks pensively into the distance. I don't know...it was alright. I enjoyed myself. Without the little trick of telling the film out of order, this movie would be extremely straight forward and kind of dull. I feel like the act of trying to piece together the events required just enough brain power to trick or distract me from noticing, I don't know, how it just wasn't that great? It was just so simple. Maybe I was expecting it to be like Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket: war film but also about human nature and Jung etc. Dunkirk was rather matter-of-factly about Dunkirk.

dkqvcuv,"This movie was tragically boring, unrealistic, and unattached. The characters had ZERO backstory. The scale of the battle was hilariously bad. Did they seriously try to make us believe that the German and British Airforces during Dunkirk consisted of THREE planes on each side? Not to the mention the hilariously bad acting. German planes fly over the Beach and drop bombs killing soldiers. What do they all do? NOTHING. they literally stand up and line up again. ZERO greiving, ZERO shouting/screaming.

This movie was a fucking joke and the only redeeming quality of it was its cinematography and sound.

dl01ci3,I didn't like Dunkirk. The points of interest felt forced. A movie i feel did a better job at what Dunkirk tried to do was The Thin Red Line. In that movie i actually gave a shit about the characters. I think that was due to the actors in general being more experience which allow them movie to not have to rely on dialog while still being engaging. The biggest emotion i got was when the small boats came in to the beach which was ruin because i knew it was the next shot by the build up. I felt like the movie did a good job making me feel like the characters were in danger but i never felt like i was in danger which the thin red line does for me. these are some of  the gripes i had with the movie. obvious there were some good things as well.,6ol0kp

Dunkirk: 

- audio was oppressive to the point that I wanted to leave
- far too much of the dialogue was unintelligible
- it had quite a few fantastic, memorable shots
- [was Tom Hardy's plane magic there at the end?](#spoiler)
- [a pleasure boat turns at full speed and that's how they don't get shot?](#spoiler)
- the time discontinuity was pointless; why was it night then day then night (same night as before) again? it only made the story confusing
- they were on that beach for a week; the movie did a bad job of showing that
- apparently the Brits had a total of 4 fighters to send 
- did I mention how much I hated the bass? Nolan: turn down the fucking bass (same in Interstellar)

dkjnuyn,"My first impression is that I did not like it and I feel in no rush to revisit it.


**Historical authenticity**

The first scenes in Dunkerque and the first scene with the little boat both have modern buildings with modern detail which is extremely unsettling and took me out of the experience very quickly. Especially the scene with the boat which has in the background a typical British 2000s style commercial building with brick walls and curtain walls. For a film with such budget they definitely could affort to correct it with some quick CGI.

Similarly some of the ships were suspicious regarding their equipment. They felt like late-war at best.

The little ships are also a fabrication of American reporting. They mattered very little and they were almost exclusively crewed by RN personnel. It were the larger civilian boats that did the real saving but Americans like a good story and believe that Hollywood=History so here we go. A film for American audiences evidently...

It felt sloppy when just a little effort could make it a realistic film at least. Very disappointed in Nolan here.

**Story and narrative** 

It seemed completely disjointed after the first 15 or so minutes. It did not hold my attention as a matter of fact it kind of wore it down.  I would say it was the opposite of Upstream Color where a similarly disjointed narrative kept me pinned to the screen because of its disjointness.   The film felt like the typical post-Batman Begins mash-up of random scenes for people with short attention span that was imitating a coherent narrative. There was a story but it did not feel like a story that was going anywhere other than from scene to scene to scene.  The anchors for each timeline were weak and confusing and were poorly constructed. People defend lack of characters but there really was nothing to replace them - neither characters nor character substitutes (like places, events etc). Everything was bland and forgettable.

**Music and sound**

The constant soundtrack was annoying because after a while it stopped being relevant and lost its effect. I happen to be listening to it as I am writing it and it doesn't hold up even as a soundtrack. There are good moments but the soundtracks to Inception and Interstellar are a regular on my list, similarly so portions of Memento, Prestige and the Batman trilogy. This one won't outside of perhaps Supermarine which was sort of a single and is quite dynamic. 

The sound in the film was too loud for what it should be, did not feel properly tactile for imitation of battlefield and quite frankly it did not feel like war at all but rather like Nolan's impression of war which isn't that great.  He also lost quite many opportunities to play along with both sound and music considering some secenes but I guess you can't expect too much here.

Loud and obnoxious it is! And then it will get quiet and everyone will be amazed.

**Visuals**

The only thing that worked were the snapshot visuals which is typical for Nolan but overall direction wasn't that great to be honest. Individual shots were good and  the overall technical production was great but nothing spectacular on an artistic level outside of several individual moments.


All in all it felt like a typical overloud, overcomplicated, oversensationalized telling of a story that could be told more effectively by a less bombastic director/writer with bland narrative, bland characters, confusing and forced use of music  (which at least in Interstellar and Inception and The Dark Knight was interesting, here it wasn't) and a really poor execution of the script, or perhaps just a bad script.

That's often the problem with a film that tries to present a complex narrative. When the script is weak the overall experience suffers. 

Here it suffers.  I do not recommend this film to anyone who isn't looking for something to watch around this time. If you are going to see this movie in particular because of reasons... there are no genuine reasons to see it.

It is probably the weakest film of a massively overhyped and overrated filmmaker who has made his name on being a *filmmaker* which is a rarity in this day and age but that doesn't excuse his faults.  I thought that The Dark Knight Rises was the weakest but there were at least moments where I wanted to follow what was going on on the screen there.  This had none and I found myself mentally exhausted and annoyed after it was done.

I would say that Nolan is the Hans Zimmer of movies. Distinct style, several iconic soundtracks and then self-repetition ad nauseam with universal acclaim from people who don't know better because they have Marvel and Star Wars for comparison.

I don't think my impression of the film will improve as so far every second viewing lowered the score. Nolan is the master of first impressions that don't hold up under greater scrutiny so... no high hopes here.

EDIT: And the -3 that I earned within first 15 minutes of writing this comment, even before I ended editing it tells me that Nolan fanboys and PR departments are hard at work to push the hype train for what is quite evidently an artistic failure.

dknuoet,"This was a terrible movie. The only thing good about it were the aerial shots, dogfighting scenes and the dive bombers at the beginning. Everything else was horrible. The music was unnecessary and annoying. There was no proper dialogue between the characters. It didn't feel like a military situation at all. There were no sergeants and officers barking orders and keeping their men disciplined. In some cases, the soldiers on the beach do things that would probably get real soldiers in trouble (like the guy who decides to abandon his unit and swim across the channel to England rather than wait on the beach). 

Things that happened that were left out:

1. The Battle of France. 
2. The effectiveness of Blitzkrieg. 
3. The German Halt Order that gave the British time to organize the evacuation. 
4. The heroism and sacrifice of British and French units who held off the Germans while the evacuation was underway and until the evacuation was complete. 
5. The French, Belgian, Polish troops that were evacuated, there were about 140,000 of them. 
6. The over 700 small boats that were involved in the rescue. In the movie you only see about 10. 

Overall, it was a movie about a bunch of guys waiting on a beach with a few cool scenes here and there.

dkie5st,"Posting my review from Letterboxd here.

Dunkirk is has the best soundtrack, most beautiful visuals, and most realistic effects of the year.

But Dunkirk is not a good movie.

Dunkirk's core problem lies in the stylistic approach that Nolan took the movie. Nolan wanted Dunkirk to be a hyper-realistic war movie, which it 100% is. However, just because it achieved it's goal of being realistic does not mean it is a good movie.

The movie has very, very little dialogue, which results in the viewers having zero connection to any of the characters, well, most of the characters. The only character who is given a sufficient amount of dialogue is Harry Styles, who ends up being the best character in the film for the sole reason of him having lines. And he is not even a main character.

Another result of having sparse dialogue is that you never really know what is going on. While the overarching narrative is clear, the specifics were lost on me, and the group of about 12 I was with. You know why the characters are where they are but you do not know how they got there.

Despite me not enjoying this movie a ton, there is some parts of this movie that are GREAT. The visuals are stunning, probably the best of the year. The sound design and sound track are amazing as well. All the effects looked very realistic which was great. The decision to not show the Germans was brilliant.

While Dunkirk overall was extremely underwhelming, there are some redeeming qualities to it.

I really WANTED to like this movie. I mean I SERIOUSLY wanted to LIKE this movie. 

But I've been sitting here trying to come up with some redeemable or 'positive' parts of it and honestly can hardly think of any.

Sound was good b/c of how loud the explosions were, and that's about it.

Oh and Tom Hardy was good too...not a 'plus' honestly since Tom Hardy is kinda a GUARANTEE pretty much to be good. 

Here's my qualms:

1) BORING!

2) SERIOUSLY BORING....seriously!

3) BORING! b/c NOTHING really happened the entire time. 

4) Can't understand what half the people are mumbling about.

5) Dogfighting scenes are AWFUL; they were basically lifted outta shots from dogfighting documentaries from WWII. Those documentaries are NOT entertaining in a 'dramatic' sense...they are meant for EDUCATION and NOT for ENTERTAINMENT. Nolan choose to make his dogfights look like THAT!

6) Couldn't even SEE the planes half the time when they were first coming in.

7) The entire movie was just one GIANT and LONG version of ""WAITTTTTT FORRRRRR ITTTTTTT"" essentially.

8) Things buildup and buildup and buildup, but there was NO Climax at ALL. 

9) Honestly, it was a LOT like just one GIANTICALLY long trailer. 

10) Characters not memorable AT ALL! Kid that bonked his head and died...I really didn't care. Dude that drowned...don't give a shit. 

11) Predictable EVRYTHING. Pilot's gonna drown huh? Ya OK like we all didn't know he was going to get rescued right at the last second. Tom Hardy might crash b/c the landing gear is jacked up right? Ya OK like we all didn't know that it was going to be all fine and dandy at the end (until Germans came). 

12) It was NOT tense after awhjjile. Using that trick with the slowly getting loudfer sound and whatever that ticking noise thing got OLD after a while. When you hear the sSAME DAMN THING and you see the SAME DAMN PATTERN over and over and OVER AGAIN and again and AGAIN it loses ALL of its value. That's EXACTLY what happened here! 

And the list goes on honestly.

I was really disapointed b/c I honestly hoping that this was going to be like one of the BEST movies I've seen in a while.

Was VERY excited at the prospect of seeing a WWII movie that was just MURICA = NUMBA 1 RED, WHITE, AND BLUE IZ BETTER THAN EVERYTHING ELSE, MURICA SAVED THE WORLD, FREEDOM/DEMOCRACRY/INDEPENDENCE/LIBERTY SAVED THE WORLD IN WWII BLAH BLAH BLAH...which is what MOST WWII movies outta Hollywood have been...just one MURICAN propaganda circle jerk after another.

And here comes Dunkirk bringing us a perspective from another side of the war that we pretty much never see; FINALLY something new and fresh and exciting and that goes against the grain and stands out....NOPE!

I'm not a sucker for gore, I don't think they should have had scenes of soldiers picking up their limbs or pushing their organs back in like in Saving private Ryan, but seeing a bomb land on a cluster of people and only seeing sand go up was kind of weird.

I don't think why this movie couldn't have gone for an R rating while keeping the gore to the required minimum as to not go all Evil dead here, but with the flexibility of knowing you can use it if you need to.

I also don't know what beneficts this movie could have gotten from a PG rating, seeing this is a very mature film that will bore most kids",6ol0kp

dkjd9mg,"The one thing that bothered me about this scene, is how they kept repeating that they need to get someone off the boat because it's too heavy, all the while there like a 800 pounds worth of water that is filling up the boat up to their knees. Like... are we blind ?",6ol0kp
dkmsbea,I couldn't really hear the dialog with the Dutch guy. Why did he go back to the boat before the tide came in?,6ol0kp
dkkmpbc,Harry Styles murdered that scene.,6ol0kp
dkigwpb,"Wasn't it kind of a ""plot hole"" though? Was it the Germans shooting or the English/French? Surely it would be the Germans because why waste a good ship? The Dutch guy was just there... Alone? Where were his crew members and other soldiers when the shooting began? Why did he enter the boat? 
The English wouldn't have been able to tell if he was Dutch or German (even we can't seeing as the accent is not that pronounced - coming from Dutch speaker). 

He also just disappeared when they were all submerged. That was probably done to add to the sense of confusion these soldiers experienced, but still felt like something was missing. ",6ol0kp
dkjt9ni,Definitely. I'll admit that I didn't know that the French soldier was the same guy we saw at the beginning burying the soldier in the sand. Then I thought it was strange that the main guy waited until the others were about to shoot him to speak up and stand up for him. ,6ol0kp

dkjnx1t,Oh my god I just realized you never see an enemy soldier clearly....,6ol0kp
dkip9ho,"totally agree and one of the things that I found most surprising. What other director would pass up using ""the bad guy"" to push the tension. ",6ol0kp
dkj92dr,"I was just confused. Why didn't the Germans push in more? Why send a few planes every few minutes, instead of just obliterating them?

I don't know if LOAC was around back then, but the fact they attacked civilian boats aiding retreating soldiers tells me, no, no it wasn't.

I was hoping for SOME German shots. Even if it was just now and again them trying to push in closer, and the Allies holding them off.",6ol0kp

dkkoujm,You're scared of what you can't see,6ol0kp
dklk5gc,This is something out of a horror/monster movie and it worked great here.,6ol0kp
dkix470,"Something that I really liked about this film. A lot of WW2 was actually like this; German soldiers getting enemy forces trapped into a corner and being able to pick them off when and where they wanted to. I feel like a lot of movies don't convey how OP the German army was a lot of the time, and this movie uses it to just instill dire despair to the audience. Brilliant if you ask me. ",6ol0kp
dkjljrm,"I went into this movie completely blind. no trailers or research or anything. I'm not at all a History buff and had no idea this was a real battle.

with Nolans history of making surreal and twisty movies, when they kept referring to the enemy as ""the enemy"" I kept wondering if it was going to turn out to be aliens or some weird take on something. I know that's too far a twist for nolan, but it was just so eerie that they just kept saying ""the enemy""",6ol0kp
dklm9ox,It kind of reminded me of great horror movies like the Mist or Alien where they don't completely show the monster until the end,6ol0kp

dkxxo4k,Even the opening scene scared the shit out of me. It felt like I was the one getting shot at,6ol0kp
dl5u5yu,Definitely made you feel at least a glimpse of the suspense of being in real war (not that I would know extensively I'm just a guy on Reddit). But just that feeling of not knowing when you're going to get attacked in a time of desperation had me feeling all sorts of suspense.,6ol0kp

dl71kxd,You're a big guy ,6ol0kp
dkknyl5,"I disagree, throughout the movie I felt no imminent threat to the beaches and no sense of urgency to evacuate. Yeah there are dive bombers every now and again but I was never actually worried about the Germans coming at them",6ol0kp
dkn187n,"I've been on the anti-Nolan train since Dark Knight Rises, and decided to grudgingly see this movie when I heard that they got actual Spitfires for the aerial shots. I don't know how much money they spent to use those for the shoot but it was absolutely worth it.",6ol0kp
dkjvvje,Maybe if it didn't seem like it was in slow motion. Also there was no need to chase the Heinkel bomber for what seemed like half an hour.,6ol0kp
dkic31h,I was nearly shitting myself from watching that. What a horrifying experience having to hear bomb after bomb being dropped closer to you. ,6ol0kp
dkibvq0,Then the dirt coming down on him. That was movie magic.,6ol0kp

He was interviewing veterans at Dunkirk as research for the film and someone told him a story about how they witnessed a soldier strip off his gear and walk straight into the ocean. Whether it was to commit suicide out of fear or to try his luck swimming, the veteran wasn't sure.

Clearly that story stuck with Nolan because he added that scene in. ",6ol0kp

>Kenneth Branagh’s character, Commander Bolton, seems to have been inspired by the real-life Captain William Tennant, who was on the scene and is credited with doing an astounding job of making the best he could out of the embarkation.

>Tennant later fought the Japanese off Singapore when HMS Repulse was sunk from beneath him. He survived to help organize the D-Day landings, even helping to lay an oil pipeline under the channel to fuel the invasion force. In other words, he made a pretty successful return to northern France after a hiatus of a few years. No word on whether he delivered dramatic one-liners as well as Kenneth Branagh.  ",6ol0kp

It may be my spoiled viewing tastes, but i felt that Nolan's dedication to practicality and non-CGI did take me out in bits of the movie, like for example how every single aircraft ""kill"" looks like they just let off a smoke canister (which is how i bet they did it)",6ol0kp
dki67hy,I thought the sound was amazing but that the dialogue was not properly mixed. ,6ol0kp
dkjgapr,"Fun fact, the clock ticking that Hans Zimmer uses is actually Nolan's Pocket Watch

i.e. the entire movie",6ol0kp
dkifzsd,"I drove 2 hrs to watch it in IMAX and the sound kept me in the movie. From gunshots to the airplanes flying overhead and the fact that there was a ticker that kept my heart beating, I will definitely say that it was worth the drive.",6ol0kp

dkt7c8q,Bring earplugs though. It was past pain threashold way too many times.,6ol0kp
dkj924u,when they were in the boat and you hear bum and then clink at the back. That was nice. Super loud. Constant base and whole body vibrating. ,6ol0kp
dkje0xs,I saw it on a Large Format screen and it was loud af.,6ol0kp
dkl6eeo,"YES. The same scenes from different perspectives was unreal. When it clicked for me what I was seeing - that I had seen it before from the air (or the land, or the sea) I freaked. I don't know if I should tell my friends who haven't seen it to pay attention for it or to let them find out themselves.",6ol0kp

dllg1kp,What about the Frenchman?,6ol0kp
dkiarlw,"My favorite part is it doesn't romanticize war being creating out of this world heroes.  It was just a whole bunch of people trying to survive and making life or death decisions.  There was fear, cowardice, adrenaline, panic, joy, and every other emotion you can possibly imagine.  It was the most realistic movie I've ever seen, war or not.  

I think the entire movie sums that up when tom hardy's character gets caught; he was the one hero who put everyone else before himself.  A few people lied and cheated and hid and survived and made it home.  If that doesn't sum up war than I don't know what does.  In real war, the hero doesn't win.  ",6ol0kp
dki7fo5,"Perfect contrast to other war films like Saving Private Ryan. This still felt large-scale, but a lot more human. Everyone's actions are real, even if sometimes wrong (I'm looking at you, Harry Styles).

It was solid from start to finish. I'll gladly give up some dialogue for what I watched tonight.",6ol0kp
dkk3pex,A different kind of war movie. It was about heroism in the face of futility. Not about heroic glory (which I think we are all used to in war movies),6ol0kp

dkk92y2,"Hans is seriously hitting his peak with this and Interstellar. I like how the soundtrack really isn't music, but another story telling device.",6ol0kp
dkirrnp,"His score for Interstellar stressed me out, and I didn't think he could stress me out even more until I watched Dunkirk. ",6ol0kp
dkjfwmn,"The score is very effective, except where we see all the civilian ships show up. At that point, the score hits the cliche emotional notes, telling the audience ""be happy here"" instead of letting the scene unfold on its own. Otherwise, I liked the score. ",6ol0kp
dkkjnbe,"Probably the sound editors at the direction of Nolan, but yeah.  It was really effective.

",6ol0kp
dki9u4q,"He kind of ripped off [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhnMd1Jl7SA) with his own variation. He takes the melody and elongates it beautifully. I would not have a problem with it if he wasn't a little dishonest in the past. He OBVIOUSLY paid homage to Holst's Mars in the Gladiator but denied it. Just admit it. Mars is the god of war, that is the idea. 

Edit: I should not have said ripped off. It is perfectly acceptable and a done beautifully. ",6ol0kp
dkjvts9,"Really? The constant ticking literally became useless after 20 minutes as it was little more than background noise. 

It felt like you were watching Jaws but the characteristic theme was playing for the entire movie. It lost its ability to induce tension. Really really disappointed by it.",6ol0kp
dki86ju,Second this. It felt like we were trying to get through it with them. I went in expecting a gritty war drama. I've never been happier to be completely wrong.,6ol0kp
dki8azv,"People criticizing the lack of deep dialogue and characterization are not appreciating this movie for what it is. Pure war, fear, and survival. Nothing else is needed.",6ol0kp
dr1tdlx,Are there any other war movies like this?,6ol0kp
dki7c9l,"When the torpedo hits the ship in the night scene, the loudness was overwhelming and perfect.

Nolan tries to put you on that ship, and it works.",6ol0kp
dkiawgi,"The sound was amazing. Unfortunately at my theater the sound was too loud - so loud that when the bass hit hard it actually vibrated the IMAX projector and made the whole screen get blurry. I'm really surprised they didn't account for that when setting it up. 

Can't wait to watch this at home with my surround sound when it comes out on Blu-ray",6ol0kp
dkizsz2,"I'm not a huge fan of Zimmer because I like scores with memorable melodies but damn is he amazing at setting a tone/mood. The movie wouldn't have been the same without him. 

Dunkirk is definitely an experience.",6ol0kp
dkiamf9,"I believe the piece at the end is, if not exactly, an excerpt from the Enigma Variations, written by the British composer Edward Elgar. The specific movement is Nimrod, here: https://youtu.be/sUgoBb8m1eE",6ol0kp
dki72za,"So true. At times, I wanted a little more, but then the camera would pan to another angle of the fighters firing rounds at each other and I was like HOLY SHIT this is intense af",6ol0kp
dkqfdz1,"From the opening shots fired, to the tick, tick, ticking finally going silent after the young guy read out Churchill's speech, the sound stage was utterly terrifying, Nolan talks about a use of the [Shepard Tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_tone) as the principles on which he wrote the script, an audio illusion where the pitch is continuously ascending, to create a story that's always getting more and more intense, and he engaged Hans Zimmer to see if he could develop a musical score which matched this construct, and took the sound of a watch with a particularly insistent ticking as a guiding reference.

Boy did they succeed, it was an emotionally draining experience, I spent the whole movie with my arms hugging my chest, ever tighter as the tension created by the sound and vision was ratcheted up. Never have I experienced this in a movie, and it will live with me for a long time. It is a masterpiece of cinema, probably the best movie I have ever seen. I have to see it again and again.",6ol0kp
dkl3b5b,"I loved the music and sound design. Everytime I see a movie with music that blows me away, I'm always hyped to discover a new composer I like. Then it's always John Williams, Hans Zimmer, or Trent Reznor. ",6ol0kp
dkmft4x,"> Never heard my local theatre this loud before

I really thought it was so well done. My favorite bits were when the german planes were going in for a bomb run and the screaming reaches almost painful levels in the cinema, which really added to getting how the soldiers felt. That noise, almost deafening, and knowing it may mean death",6ol0kp
dkknqys,"My theater had audio problems during the previews, and they had to reboot their sound system. I'm hoping that was the reason my showing seemed the opposite of this, because the music seemed way too quiet in the mix relative to the explosions.",6ol0kp
dkk6cyt,Yes this!!! The Stuka scenes alone were worth seeing the movie in IMAX! Also enjoyed the way they made use of the clock ticking background noise throughout the movie. I caught my leg nervously tapping along with it and as it would speed up and get louder you could just viscerally feel the tension rise.,6ol0kp
dkjwiq9,"They reinforced how close the Germans were with the opening scene.

dkib0bo,"I immediately understood what “One week, one hour, one day meant”, but I still got kinda lost.",6ol0kp

I could've sworn it said ""one week ago. one hour ago. one day ago""

Or maybe I just interpreted it as such lol.

Also, yes, Styles has big things coming for him. Multi-talented person.",6ol0kp
dki8zbv,"Pretty clear that he was a dbag and his actions will haunt him for the rest of his life. Also, well acted, but it was tough to really judge the acting in the movie with so much action and so little dialogue.

dkiba3l,"Ah I took the time stamp as how long it took to get out of Dunkirk

A week by land, a day by sea, an hour by air

But I think you are correct ",6ol0kp
dklpk4d,"Agreed. With the exception of the Batman series, I sometimes feel like Nolan's stuff suffers from unnecessary intricacy and the type of cleverness that can drown out other important elements of the experience.  

However, the layered timelines worked so beautifully in this movie. Gosh it was just such an excellent movie. I hope he gets a lot of recognition for it during awards season.",6ol0kp

My main reason for dislike was that the entire movie was built up to be about space, discovery, man vs nature. Yet suddenly in Act III the movie turned into a movie about ""love"". That shift was jarring and felt non-congruent with what the rest of the movie was building up to be. By all means, an excellent space movie, but certainly one of his weaker films.

I wish I had connected the dots with Cillian Murphy.  I never realized the guy on the lifeboat was him.

Boredom stemmed from the aforementioned lack of dialogue, lack of heavy action and barren character development. If the characters were American, a bit more bombastic and there was some more cgi then this movie would've appealed to them. Even though my opinion seems rather illogical and narrow minded, as I scrolled through the videos, people who disliked the movie generally couldn't put an articulate sentence together and LOVED superhero movies. Sometimes I'm ashamed to be American. The palate for great cinema and the emotional intelligence to comprehend such a dire situation seem to be sternly absent from the American mind. Americans have been conditioned into yearning for mindless action and fantastical characters. Dunkirk really should have a societal consensus on how great it is, but alas the Hollywood machine and American education ruins it.",6ol0kp

dkkyeq7,"He didn't really have a choice. Landing requires a lower speed than flying, so he had to burn speed by spending time losing altitude.

dkk9v1g,"I don't remember any of their names and yet I was completely invested in them. I felt sorry for that quiet French kid who drowned shortly after he was getting interrogated for being a spy. I wanted George to be okay. I admired Rylance's kid for not telling Cillian Murphy that George died. I sympathised with Cillian Murphy because he only did what he did out of fear and didn't mean to cause any harm. I felt sorry for Harry Styles thinking he was a failure. I liked the other pilot who crashed and ultimately helped Rylance save people. I liked Tom Hardy saving the day when needed and facing up to being captured. I respected Branagh's character for choosing to stay behind to help the French.

I didn't know any of their names and I didn't really need to. It's not relevant. George was the only one I remembered and that was because of Rylance's delivery of it from the trailer and the fact I read a spoiler here before the movie saying RIP George. But I still cared about what happened despite knowing it, because of that part where Rylance's kid says about being careful with his body. 

The ending with the boats coming to save the day showed it well to me how we're meant to care for the overall situation and resolve. How it was a failure but all those men made it home alive. I didn't need to know their names or see character development, I was too engrossed with their struggles during the event and whatever dialogue was used for them furthered my investment with them.

dkk9tg8,"Mark Rylance stood out for me. He was calm on the surface through it all for the most. He represented the frontier feeling that, I think people felt in Europe. And yes, the story was about survival. About getting out of there alive, living to fight another day.",6ol0kp

dkidoed,"George is the only major character in the film that dies. It seemed like an interesting reversal (it's rare that a Hollywood movie will kill off a child) and it also shows the idea of civilians risking their lives so that soldiers may live.

When they do something that breaks that mold, its hard to understand why, because we don't know what caused the change in their mindset. 


Think about the boat captain's son. All I remember him doing is asking if Cillian Murphy's character is a coward, locking Cillian Murphy in the storeroom, comforting George, asking the downed pilot to check on George.... and then lying to Cillian Murphy to make him feel better? That last action came out of nowhere and makes no sense.

dkw11j8,"I agree.

I'm surprised by those criticizing for lack of ""Relatable characters"": I found it very easy to relate to the majority of main characters.

The complaint seems to the rooted in the idea that if a character is a blank slate, then he's not relatable. In reality, almost every successful story book hero (using the literary definition of hero) is a blank slate, the blanker the better, otherwise it's hard to put yourself in their shoes.

Notable: while there are small ""negative"" actions by some side characters in the first part, it waits until the second act before we see characters doing something terrible things, so even then we already have enough *context* to know, and forgive, the characters doing this - in other words, once we actually need a back story to understand something with complexity and nuance, we already have one - they're in a f---ing war, they're cannon fodder, they're scared, shell shocked, and desperate.

dkz58lj,"Born and living in Germany, I first went to see the movie in the German dubbed version (only way to see it in an IMAX setting in my area sadly). Everyone was speaking German, the French, English and Scottish. They all came across as generic soldiers, which made it all feel unauthentic. Watching it a second time in the original version, it felt so real, the difference was staggering. I'm really fed up with our country's need to dub everything. So much culture and authenticity is lost. It was especially important here. This was a British story through and through, so you NEED them to speak as they do or it all seems fake.

The sound department certainly should be nominated or win, the sound design alone made you feel like you're in it. Never before have I heard gunshots like they were featured in Dunkirk, they scared me.",6ol0kp

When I think of Britain in World War II I think of a people who somehow kept a very stiff upper lip and didn't feel the need to get fussy even when their country was on the verge of annihilation. As American viewers I think we're conditioned to feel a lot of drama and emotional depth whenever something goes awry for a protagonist. Dunkirk was distinctly lacking in that, and had a kind of dry undertone (for instance, there's no sense of impending dread when [Collins gets shot down, it's just kind of taken in stride and it's on to the next problem)](#spoiler). Which brings me to the sound, I really enjoyed Hans Zimmer's minimalist score that allowed the viewer to feel emotions based on what happened instead of on musical cues. The sound in general was extremely well done, in my opinion. Stuka's are loud and terrifying, so make their sirens super loud and have them drown out just about everything else. I wouldn't change a thing about any of that.",6ol0kp

There were also no real reasons for anyone's character to develop. Nothing was added to the lives of those characters that wasn't there already, nothing forced them to deal with situations they weren't already in.

No, the strength of the film was character _study_, not development. Looking deep into its characters and seeing what makes them do what they do. Seeing the pilot deal with the problem of low fuel, and whether to stay and fight, or return and refuel. Seeing the small boat captain deal with a personal crisis and choose whether to save the one, or the many. Seeing the soldiers deal with the hell that is war, and how far they'd go to stay alive, or whether they'd sell out their comrades just to survive themselves.

He did a really good job isolating that and when you look at some of the choices certain characters made: selflessness by Tom Hardy, selflessness by the Frenchman, selflessness by the Admiral juxtaposed with the selfishness of others, you get the whole ""adversity doesn't build character, it reveals it.""

I felt like I was suddenly watching a video game round on Twitch, the way that people ""died"" and then were just, well, not there anymore.  No mangled bodies, no screaming, no panic around them as people ran to their aid.  100% dead, or not injured, and nobody's allowed to scream.  Suddenly then you're back and engrossed in the story again - a jarring transition.

It felt very surreal - and with the spectacle of seeing it in IMAX, and the incredible visuals, and the scope and detail of the aerial combat and all that fantastic footage, the removal of the final horrific results of a dive bomber attack against huddled and exposed troops was somehow nullifying to the overall effect of the film.

This may or may not be a little too far-fetched, but I took the ""the old man wouldn't even look us in the eye"" as a reflection of Alex himself - because he mistreated the very man that saved his life by evacuating him from the sinking ship; the french man. While Alex was blinded by panic and suspense, he failed to empathize with the french man and chose to justify his anger on him, accusing him of being a spy and went as far as pointing a gun towards him. Alas, the french man drowned and lost his life while Alex hadn't had an ounce of remorse (I presume?). Figuratively, Alex ""didn't even look at the french man in the eye""

That's exactly what I think he was trying to convey with this film. The absolute desperation to leave that beach and get home. But there was absolutely nothing they could do but wait.

The soldiers just looked dead inside, like their actions where all completely empty and none of them felt human.

It really bothered me because it's not really normal human behavior and you definitely don't that kind of behavior in a hollywood film. It's not what you expect and I think it threw alot of critics off.

dkrfsrr,[deleted],6ol0kp
dkrkxud,"I don't like the argument *""the movie is not about the characters""*, essentially because Nolan uses cinematic language and makes narrative choices that say *""look, these characters, they are important""*. So, it not being about the characters argument becomes deflective and moot. 

There were 400,000 men on the beach. We follow mostly 2. That is a narrative choice. We don't have narrative like Thin Red Line, with lots of protagonists and snapshots of their lives. We have fixed, small number of main characters, less than 10 in the whole movie (2-3 on beach, 3-4 on boat, 2 on air), which is not a lot for a war movie. We have one boat, not tens or hundreds. We have two survivors, not 400,000. And we follow a squadron of 3 planes, not 300. 

The story can exist on many levels, and here the focus is on individuals and small groups, not on masses. And that's a narrative choice that Nolan made. I am not saying is it good or bad choice, but it is a choice that enforces characters, not events or masses. 

Also there are many moments in the movie where a **character** faces a near-death experience, and these moments are usually told in close-ups, with the viewer literally next to the characters, sharing their fate, and these take up minutes of the valuable screen time. These are all cinematic ways of saying *""look at what is happening now, it's important, focus on this""*. 

[Look at the way first pilot dies: we realize it after the fact, and only see it from a wide shot. Nolan is telling us with cinematic language that his life/death was not important. Now compare it how the second pilot almost dies. We are with him in the plane as it is sinking, witnessing his struggles in close-up shots, in ""real time"", until he is saved. Nolan is forcing us to focus on this one character. And this happens many times during the movie, with many characters.](#spoiler)

It's not that he has to do it this way. He can show and has shown many deaths from wider, more objective perspectives, which emphasizes the group and the surroundings, essentially the narrative that it's about the event. But more often than not, he takes the central characters and shows their blight in all its detail, which is again a character-focused narrative choice. The question that the audience faces is *""can HE survive?""*. 

So either Nolan didn't know what kind of story he wanted to tell (event or characters), or he knew but partly failed in it, regardless of which one he chose. ",6ol0kp
dkmdhyk,"I absolutly agree. I think the timelines ruined it. I never felt hopeless beacuse of it and the stress didnt get to me.

Going in to the movie i thought i would feel hopeless, afraid and despair. Instead i got the opposite. The timelines showing the future made me feel optimistic and in the end i felt good and hopeful.

If you cut it simple, the movies shows you what being in dunkirk is (all the boring waiting of dunkirk, fear of stukas appearing out of nowhere, the terror of being surrounded, the gruesome picture of home is just right there but you can't go there), then it shows you this character and like any other soldier, all he want is just to go home, and then it shows you that to get home is possible, even if it might not work (the air and sea part, the rescuers). And without yourself become attached to this one character, you have that shared agreement you want to see these soldiers return home and that the boat saving operation to succeed.

to Quote Nolan:
>""What if we strip the conventional theatrics away?"" I wanted to produce a film that was almost entirely based on the language of suspense, ... what Hitchcock understood — and I've tried to emulate and really learn from — is that the audience can care about a character simply by virtue of what it is they're trying to achieve onscreen in a physical sense, a task they're trying to achieve. We very immediately, as audience members, we lean into that. We find ourselves in their shoes very quickly, and I wanted to make a film that really snuck up on the emotions.

Edit:
in a sense, I do actually believe before anyone sees this movie to learn themselves about the events that lead to dunkirk, it allows you to understand, these are weary men, new to the war and then beaten on the very early part of a war.",6ol0kp
dkr736i,"Agreed. And it wasn't like there wasn't ANY development, i mean, i know Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) doesn't talk that much, but the movie literally opens up with him and his unit walking around town, only to find out he's the sole survivor and only makes it to the next step of danger; being another soldier on this open targeted beach. What a shitty realization to come to. Get in line and wait. That sucks so much. 

Laying down head in the sand only hoping you don't get blown up. There's no time for chatting about shit when that's happening. Just think of what is going on in his head, that's development. ""When am i going to die, when am i going to get off this fucking beach"" is what is going through every single solider's mind the entire time. We don't need to know what happened before we met the characters. It's like Battlefield I (WWI game). There are different characters going through different environments of war. You can only think of so many things they could be thinking in their head, their girlfriends, family, friends.  There's something to say about development there. ",6ol0kp
dkq65zg,"My biggest complaint is that the movie is about the event and yet doesn't capture the scale or significance of the event. The evacuation was 10 days, so 10 trips to Dunkirk. The movie only shows 1 and then the evacuation is over. On top of this, it didn't capture the desperation and hopelessness of the situation. 

It hardly touches upon the wounded abandoned on the beach, the abandoned equipment including 65000 vehicles that littered Dunkirk, the 35000 soldiers ordered to hold the perimeter and fight to the last man, and the lack of food and water due to being surrounded. 

The movie could've really benefited from CGI to show the scale of the evacuation. ",6ol0kp
dkiu2yh,Someone brought up the good point that if you don't even know the characters name and just see him as Tom Hardy it really affects your suspension of disbelief. ,6ol0kp

dkivrhf,"I agree fully.  This isn't a fair comparison but the stuff in Saving Private Ryan like shooting through the sniper scope and finding some other guy named Ryan is good story but sometimes you just want to see people surviving. That was Dunkirk for me, I'm sure the historians will all come out of the woodwork and be all like ""the heinkel bomber would have been able to shoot the spitfire at this particular angle with ease"" or  ""their uniforms were a different shade of olive drab"" but I feel they most likely nailed the realism in this film. ",6ol0kp
dkitw0i,"""Tom Hardy's character""

You can't even name him and that is half the issue.

Now, don't get me wrong, not every movie needs to be Anna Karenina, you don't need extensive characters in every film. I also think it is a particularly lazy critique to write off a film just for lack of character development. 

However you still need some kind of character development. During the evacuation there were 400,000 men shipped out, 4,000 died and 60,000 tommies were captured after the Ardennes fell.

The RAF flew over 100 sorties to Dunkirk, the Navy worked without rest for weeks. In this movie it honestly felt like two unnamed fighter pilots, a destroyer and fifty dinghys saved two un named soldiers. Maybe 10,000 on the beach.

For a screenplay you need high stakes, and there simply was not enough in this movie. The characters I could forgive if I felt the scale of the battle, but it was never there.

Technically superb, but the script was so under done. If this was anyone but Nolan it would not have been made.

Take Saving Private Ryan, not my favourite war film, but you understood the high pressure stakes. One family with three dead, you see the Mother's reaction, you hear Ryan talk about losing his brothers and his pain in leaving his unit behind. You see the captain's pain in the FUBAR mission.

That was a narrative that drove itself. Dunkirk had none of that.

Fuck it, it was worth it just for the dogfights and score, 10/10; film of the year. ",6ol0kp

It's not like Michael Bay makes every decision on those films. There are still special effects people who work on making those explosions look cool, sound people, cinematographers, etc.

When he opens up the cockpit and hears the cheering, I think he realized that ditching the plane and parachuting out or crash landing somewhere nearby would put a damper on the moment.

 A traditional approach to most narrative storytelling.  Instead, the filmmaker attempted to viscerally immerse you with the cinematography and music to evoke a psychological state of what any of those British soldiers felt in trying to stay alive; either while trying escaping or ensuring that that other's escape.  You're not *supposed* to sympathize with only one single character, the end goal is for audience to have a ""semblance"" what is was like, to be in FUBAR situation beyond all hope and find a way to survive for another day.

Are surely beautiful the portrait of the struggle for the survival of the soldiers, the egoism that only cause trouble while the altruism save people, the fear of the empty spaces etc, but from a director that get us used to huge and complex plot, full of facts, ideas and concept a war movie of 1h and 40 that could be of 40 min let me a bit disappointed. The Hans Zimmer's music rise tension but it uses almost the same music of the other movies such as dark night, a few violin's chord played more and more faster, and also the montage between the different stories is equal to previous movies like inception.

Despite that though, for me at least, this still winds up being my favorite film of the year so far. Any good stories on WWII always get a notch up, and Nolan I feel like delivered a great story to help not just 1D fans, but ANY person born after WWII gain perspective on what the war was really like.

Touching on your points, I think the main immersion breaker for me was the sparse dialogue and lack of 'bustle'. The beach shots didn't feel alive at all. There wasn't really a visceral sense of what it would feel like to be stranded on this beach, tired, scared, with thousands and thousands of men around you and the enemy breathing down your neck.

And maybe I've been spoiled by Band of Brothers but where was the banter or conversation in general, perhaps just speculation on what was going to happen to them? I know Nolan was going for this quiet dread kind of vibe but it just didn't feel human enough to me. 

Lack of gore feels like an unnecessary thing to complain about but it did take me out of the experience when people were getting bombed and not getting blown to smithereens.

I did appreciate how it avoided going too Hollywood (with the exception of Hardy taking down that bomber when his plane was stalled) but it just didn't quite hit the spot for me. Lacking in a bit of heart perhaps.

We learned his son died in the war, but I think most people had a son who fought in the war and maybe died. Nothing was special about these characters. It's the story of all 400,000 men not just a few. They avoided subplots because that would imply these people were different and special compared to all the other soldiers, but they weren't. ",6ol0kp

I can agree with people that there was a lack of character development, but I'm not sure what other story you could expect from a movie that was going to be based on just the evacuation portion of one event in all of WWII. 

Additionally, I could get over the character development, because the depiction of war wasn't glorified and it never made a spectacle of itself in a way, that was incredibly flashy and screamed ""LOOK AT MY PYROTECHNICS AND EXPLOSIONS"". As a result, while I never felt a connection to most of the characters, I instead thought of the actual soldiers that lived the ordeal of suffering a major defeat and having to evacuate an active war zone.

I don't think that's the case. Like a movie belonging to any other genre, the audience needs sequences during which they can relax, and during which they can learn about some of the back-story of the characters on-screen. 

Great war movies often have scenes in which a group of soldiers are resting at the end of a day of marching or between fighting. In those scenes we learn a great deal about the movie's characters, so that we care that much more when the action begins again.

And we saw, what, 10 allied planes at most and a similar number of Luftwaffe? I just looked it up and there were over 200 planes lost (from both sides) at least during the evacuation.

""How are those handful of boats going to rescue 300,000 people?"" etc. when there were hundreds of boats in reality. Not to mention you didn't get the feeling that there were hundreds of thousands of people there in the first place.

Just some establishing shots would have been sufficient. In terms of practical vs. CGI, I think this is an example of going too far in one direction.

""What are you doing?"" Alex asks, ""Making a movie I guess, but I don't know if it's any good."" answers the enigmatic auteur. Alex, in an effort to make the human connection he desperately craved for, insists on watching this film, the man agrees. Alex's eyes widen like Moses parting the sea, as the images of a big masked man having a duel of wits with a member of the Central Intelligence Agency inside of an airplane; he has never experienced the euphoric rush of melodic art as he has just now.

Alex, rendered almost speechless by what he has just witnessed, manages to stutter, not the words that he intended, for these were much more grandiose, but the ones he managed to say due to his shock: ""I feel like my mind has been penetrated"". The mysterious man brushes his hair and lowers his face, trying, but failing to hide the sudden blush on his cheeks. ""I don't think it's that good"", the man says. ""You're insecure, don't know what for"" Alex responds, slowly collecting himself.

They lock eyes, as Alex softly brushes the man's cheek (as pictured in the thread's thumbnail). ""My name is Christopher, by the way."" Before Alex is able to find the words to respond, he is tragically taken back by the thoughts of his imminent future, a future where he has to fight a senseless war in the beaches of Dunkirk, all the upcoming pain, suffering, blood and lead that he will witness. Alex holds back a tear as he turns around, silently parting ways with Christopher as he accepts his cruel fate. Disheartened, Christopher bravely screams in agony ""Did I do something wrong?"". Alex stops in his tracks, takes one last look at the sapphire water and the starry heavens, as he contemplates the beauty of this world, and how he must protect it, no matter the bloodshed and torment of the thunderous war. ""You don't know you're beautiful"", says Alex mustering his last words, which he whispers to the faithful wind; ""that's what makes you beautiful.""",6ol0kp

dkj2m6h,"The character development is important because it makes it possible to relate to them so you can be more emotionally invested in the movie, especially when the focus is on humanity and the how easily it's compromised in the face of desperation.  This movie was soooo close to hitting that mark, but the fact that the characters seemed like they were only going through the motions made it hard to care about what happened to them.",6ol0kp
dkiwnpt,"Honestly I see this a lot, and that it is the point of the film, to have characters that are very ordinary people.

That is fair, but I do not think this level of defence would go out to anyone if it wasn't Nolan.

Look at Rogue One and Godzilla, for example, I would say similar ideas about characters. The characters in those movies are vessels to carry the narrative, nothing more. We see Godzilla and the Muto fight, and we see the battle for the plans of the Death Star. The characters were not the main point, yet those movies were slammed for their characters.

What connection did we have in this movie, other than Rylance? Most people can't name more than three names in this movie.

It isn't an issue when you have limited characterisation, but you need some, just even a little, to carry the plot. Otherwise you have two pilots you can't name save two soldiers you cant name and few other people for exposition. No stakes means a flat story. That is bad writing. 

The technical side of the film saves it, that was brilliant, but the writing does not get a pass just because it was ""meant to be that way.""",6ol0kp

I thought it was ""one week until the big battle"" or whatever, and later on I forgot they existed.

The timeline was super confusing to me.

Okay aside but aside from giving the script some dramatic weight the most plausible culprit would probably be a combination of distances, speed, and angles. I'm not sure how hairpin a turn a gliding Spitfire can safely pull off but I'd imagine with only inertia its a very different thing then a powered turn. And if he can't line up with the very narrow strip of the beach itself then it is not going to work. And if he doesn't have the right speed he couldn't land safely.

It's weird that the first and only time I was bored was supposed to be the most exciting part of the film. But he set up and shot the other capsizing/swimming shot so similarly that I felt I had already seen this footage. And the addition of the oil didn't differentiate it enough.

dko6gsn,"Agree with a lot of this. On a macro level, it was a beautiful movie with a lot of incredible moments and a thrill to watch in IMAX. But....I just didn't know exactly what I should be feeling for so much of it.

But it just felt like a lot of tension building up to I-wasn't-sure-what. I didn't know how to feel about the two non-speaking guys and if they were spies or not (having their part titled 'the mole,' didn't fucking help), but that game of 'are they or aren't they' didn't amount to much when it was finally revealed. I couldn't have cared less about the kid who died (so he just knocked his head on a wheel downstairs? what? Why was the audience supposed to care about him at all? He had hardly any dialogue.).

Also, FWIW I get that it's more satisfying to have it be 1 week/1 day/1 hour, but the 'week' storyline certainly didn't do much of a job of actually conveying when was when. It felt like 48 hours, not a week.

Quarter-way through the movie, I just decided that they were making a distinction between the experiences of those on land (1 week), on sea (1 day), in the air (1 hour) and that all three timelines would converge at some/multiple points. Which they did. But it definitely could have been made a tad less confusing without the ""Mole"" moniker. I don't recall the 1-week and 1-hour timelines having their own particular names.

In the move to digital projection two main aspect ratios have been favoured, Scope and Flat. And in the move to build cinemas cheaply and with impact cinema builders have embraced fixed width and height screens with no masking to hide the bit of the screen that isn't being used. 

So the screen in your auditorium has a Scope ratio either 2.35:1 or 2.40:1. For those playing DUNKIRK in a digital version of the film they told projectionists to run the film in Flat aspect ratio (1.85:1) to preserve the 2:20:1 aspect ratio. What your cinema didn't do was fiddle around with the settings to zoom in the picture so as to fill the height but not the width of the screen.  

You can read more about this in the letter that went out to projectionists with the digital film. http://digitalcinema.bydeluxe.com/site/dlxportal/docs/projectionistletter_dunkirk_usa_20170721_170358.pdf

So it was played correctly, it just could have been played a little better!

edit: Here's a quick crappy visual comparison - http://imgur.com/a/etz1d",6ol0kp
dkjkk78,Movie filled the whole screen at my local cinema.  ,6ol0kp
dkjjr5l,"I haven't seen it in IMAX or 70mm but I had no problem like that in a regular (35mm with a digital projector) theater.  I remember seeing The Dark Knight in IMAX and being annoyed by how dramatically the size of the screen would jump, sometimes for only a two second establishing shot filmed in IMAX only to immediately return to standard presentation.  ",6ol0kp
dkjkap0,I did and actually thought it was because of the theatre I watched the movie. Thanks for informing about that :),6ol0kp
dkjtp9s,"Completely agree with your thoughts. There was something that felt off. I struggled to feel emotionally engaged with the multiple timelines. 

With that said, the sound and 70MM presentation was INCREDIBLE. ",6ol0kp
dkjtre9,"I think the focus of the film was to convey the absolute hopelessness of the situation, and the relatively undeveloped characters did exactly that. It was a bit experimental and I think it worked.  ",6ol0kp
dkjw175,">  I couldn't understand what they were saying

I realized after a point that it almost didn't necessarily matter what they were saying, because you easily got the gist of what they were trying to convey--fear, desperation, etc.  ",6ol0kp
dkk44m4,I felt like the criticism of the elderly man was because he personally believed that returning home alive from a huge defeat in war like this was a disgrace to both himself and to his country. He likely felt this way about himself for not having succeeded and coming home a loser and he was subconsciously validating his own opinion of himself by projecting it onto others that he saw and interacted with.,6ol0kp
dkkaojw,"This film was meant to have a relatively low age rating. The only reason it has the rating it has is because Harry Styles swears in a scene. I read Nolan liked it and kept it.

I guess it's good if more young people can watch this film - 12 year old me would definitely have been down!

* spelling",6ol0kp
dkkpc7r,">It's not as bloody as Private Ryan, but it's more psychologically intense. Being on the inside of a boat and waiting at any moment for a torpedo to hit and sink you, trapped inside to drown, kind of intensity. And when the tension breaks, it's loud and frightening.

No horror movie has ever made me as jumpy and skittish as Dunkirk did last night. Being a late showing, I didn't walk out of the theater until it was 1 in the morning. I swear, dead quiet as it was that late at night, I was subconsciously bracing for the crack of a gunshot or the distant whine of a German fighter plane. I paid $15 to be stressed for 2 hours lol

dkkq0fh,"
In reality, Pilots were actually treated badly after the evacuation. The Spitfires weren't meant for long range so when they got to the beach they only had about 45 minutes of flight time over the beach. However, they would get into engagements with German fighters and bombers and never it make it to the beach. The soldiers on the beach never saw them and thought they were cowards.",6ol0kp
dkkpej2,It's worth nothing that there were testimonies of crashed pilots having to fight for spots on boats. If anything the resentment towards pilots was underplayed in the movie.,6ol0kp
dkl3dm3,"I like that Mark Rylance then says ""they know where you were"" looking at the Soldiers that had been in their boat.",6ol0kp
dkla2ra,"http://i.imgur.com/EXgqEzI.jpg

Here's a picture from the actual beach. You have to remember the beach is very long and not all 400000 men were on the beach at the same time. Some were still fighting and others were already on the boats headed to England.",6ol0kp
dkla50h,"i thought they didn't evacuate everyone at the same time (so the movie didn't capture everything, just the evacuation of the british troops which was like 30,000? - when the guy say's he's going to wait for the french assuming there's a lot more people to get off the beach) so like the 1st narrative, the mole, isn't completely done in the movie ",6ol0kp
dklkj6s,that's not cam?,6ol0kp
dklsiaz,I assume it's just because he's the captain and he wanted to make his own decisions on his vessel.,6ol0kp
dklzy63,IMO Chris Nolan has conservative viewpoints and it seeps through his movies including this one. Themes like patriotic duty and the importance of chain of command usurp normal Hollywood themes like the horrors of war and the failures of leadership. ,6ol0kp
dkm26rj,"Yes, there is obviously violence but the gore factor is actually pretty low. More importantly, there aren't any sex scenes to make anyone uncomfortable. It's a good movie to watch in the theater too, the huge speakers make the sound of the dive bombers coming in really memorable. ",6ol0kp
dklzpbq,Most likely,6ol0kp
dkmc39p,The audience actually skews much older than for most movies ,6ol0kp
dkmhhmg,"It was like literally all in a single time jump.

See we can very probably peg the climax/intersection as being the [28th of May 1940](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkirk_evacuation) as that is when the first little boats got there. The British rearguard left on the 3rd of June so the sleepy private and mention of the French still to come pegs that scene pretty well. That's seven days right there by my count and with the actual story clearly involving night and tides before you probably really need eight days.

I'd speculate if not just for coolness we are looking at a script artifact where they started writing for ""a week"" with good intentions but the actual story that came to them turned out ill suited to that. Which honestly is fine you go where the muse takes you... but someone should maaaybe have changed that time frame.

Of course the week, day, hour, idea is still kinda nice even if we are just fudging it which is maybe why it survived. ",6ol0kp
dkmg5ou,I totally agree about The Mole. I missed the part at the start saying it was a week and totally thought it was all going on in the space of a couple of days.,6ol0kp
dkmj667,"> Overall I really liked the score, I just wish it would have built more instead of just being elevated throughout.

I noticed that too. It seemed to be repeating the suspenseful, eerie notes relentlessly. It was an interesting tactic to keep the audience in suspense for that long like High Interval Training but I agree that I wish it built more.",6ol0kp
dkmk0ul,"The main reason I think The Mole plot was so rushed was to avoid breaking the pacing of the film. It was meant to be short and tight, and while I think that adding a good 30 minutes to expand that timeline and give it more breathing room it wouldn't have been as good, there would have been more accusations of self-indulgence like when *Interstellar* came out. ",6ol0kp
dkncvte,"I think people are really missing the point of this film. There isn't 'characters' as such because in that situation there aren't. When put in that situation who people are drains away and they just become survival machines. We shouldn't be connecting with these people because we know their backstory, we should be connecting because they are people. It doesn't matter who the man stuck in a flaming patch of oil is. It just matters that he's there.",6ol0kp
dkn9qcx,The same with almost every Nolan film. Everything is there apart from an emotional connection. James Cameron is a master of that. I find Nolan too cold.,6ol0kp
dknwpn7,I thought he was repeatedly gliding back and forth to provide air cover until everyone else was gone.,6ol0kp
dknsuto,[deleted],6ol0kp
dknu5t8,At that point the Germans would have captured the whole beach probably and the allies had all left. He couldn't fly all the way back to Britain because he was out of gas and flying into the water and waiting for a rescue boat could be very dangerous. Landing on the beach was probably the best thing he could do.,6ol0kp
dko8392,the funny thing with tom hardy landing is that his character probably survive as PoW where treated surprisingly well in ww2 being one of the law of war the germans didn't break.,6ol0kp
dko5r6s,[Fairly sure my jaw dropped when the ticking stopped once Tommy fell asleep. To abruptly bring something you've been hearing subconsciously throughout the film back to the forefront by marking its absence was such a simple but powerful moment.](#spoiler),6ol0kp
dkt0ocs,"It's probably lost in this thread but someone a few days ago explained how it would be possible. It involved manoeuvres similar to a controlled stall (which WW2 pilots were familiar with).

The fact is all happens off-screen is a bit off especially, as you said, earlier flight-sequences seems to illustrate how hard dogfights were. 

I think the same person who posted said it was based on a real-life incident but all I'm doing is repeating what someone else on here said!

Ha, look at this answer from a Slate piece:



Did an RAF pilot shoot down a dive-bomber over Dunkirk while gliding?

What do you think?

dktq9zy,"I understood it as him getting back to the beach, getting on another boat out which also sunk, and that being where they find him. Almost dying twice in a matter of hours makes sense, given his shellshock",6ol0kp

dl03f03,"Huh. Film student here, too. I'm actually surprised to say that I totally didn't notice that, and I knew he did it too since someone told me about it in the Dark Knight rises. I guess he just does it better than I thought and it's one of those things that you won't notice until you do and once you do you can never forget. ",6ol0kp
dl04sx5,"I think it is 2 formats - regular film and IMAX. And yes it is a bit jarring, especially since you can also notice the drop in resolution when it switches to regular film.

Unfortunately it isn't something he can fix easily - shooting 100% with an IMAX camera has never been done, though I was really pleased he shot 70% with it!",6ol0kp
dlc4hsj,"It was described in the beginning of the movie. The events on the beach took place over 1 week, the events on the boat with the father and son took place over 1 day, and the events involving the fighter pilots took place over 1 hour.",6ol0kp
dkjok9e,That kinda sounds like your sound mix might have been off. Each gun shot in my showing shook the seats. The screaming of the planes diving was actually deafening. All of that definitely contributed to the tension; the constant switch from silence to roaring noise was a big part of the movie.,6ol0kp
dkj13ut,It was definitely your theatre. That was the loudest movie I've ever seen. My ears were ringing afterwards. I can see how it would be underwhelming in an normal theatre ,6ol0kp

dki7w4t,[deleted],6ol0kp
dkie34a,"the tension is not in the characters, but in the music and the whole 'situation'. You don't need to cheer for a John when you cheer for all of them. Just like real war, it's not about a hero, but about thousands of regular guys who die left and right and you can't even know their names. 

Shame you didn't like it, but I think you just had your hopes up too high or was thinking of something different. it's not a blockbuster, it's a very sad drama.

>Dunkirk isn't an action movie, it's a drama about survival. 

sorry I see you wrote it yourself. ",6ol0kp
dkib2xf,"I cannot believe I had to scroll this far down to find you. 

Everyone that I saw it with totally agreed on the film. We thought it was boring as fuck. Visuals- great. Of course, it's Nolan. 

But dude come on. 

I get it. I get what you're all saying. ""It's intentional to make it really feel like war."" I don't care. I get it. I get what you're saying. I paid $10 to see an intense summer blockbuster, not ""Trailer Shots: The Movie."" 

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Everyone loved this? It was fine but I wanted to fall asleep the whole time. There was no emotional connection to anyone. I feel like nothing happened. It's like I watched the same 7 scenes repeated like 3-5 times each. 

1. People looking up then ducking
2. Civilian boats heading toward Dunkirk
3. Tom Hardy shooting at someone
4. Boat gets hit, people have to escape or drown
5. Officer standing on dock saying the same shit over and over again (Jesus Christ, the worst one)
6. Soldiers standing in lines
7. ""Something something war, Georgie!""

dkisvps,thats cuz you're a bugman,6ol0kp
dkm6td9,"I totally agree with you. And I loves Nolan's other films (Batman, Prestige, Memento). I just think this movie is more catered to a niche audience. The only character investments I had were the turtle neck blonde kid who would've kicked that soldier's ass (or tried to) in real life and the french kid who Harry Styles was a terrible human being to.

I had to force myself to invest in the plot just because I'd payed 24 bucks for a ticket for the IMAX 70mm showing that I drove two hours to get to with my friend who majored in British history.",6ol0kp
dkieccy,"Yeah I'm in the same boat bud. I'm not someone who has a short attention span or anything either. I can watch slow-moving korean or french  films and stuff like that. But this film just lacked something for me. I think it was the annoyance of not being able to hear the dialogue a lot of the time coupled with the combination of the shifting timelines with the hyper-realism. I couldn't get sucked into the realism because the timeline kept shifting leaving me disoriented, but the realism made the impact of the shifting timeline have no punch for me. When people say their jaw was on the floor when they saw Cillian Murphy's character being normal all I can think is ""why?"" what was impactful about it? 

Idk, it didn't work for me but we're obviously the minority.

That said: beautifully shot, incredible score, well acted.",6ol0kp

The good things were Andrew Garfield's performance and Hugo Weaving's performance. Though Garfield had some trouble with his accent.

Although the battle sequences were well done , i could follow everything and Mel Gibson sure created the feeling of War is Hell , i thought he went a little overboard , i sort of became numb to all the violence happening and wasn't shocked by all the gore . It was a 7/10 movie for me.

Dunkirk on the other hand felt something special",6ol0kp

dkl0f4a,"> As someone who studies history, and plans to teach it, I must say that having a bit of the film dedicated to the ""halt order"" from the Germans would have helped depicted how the rescue was able to happen. As other might have noticed in the film, no German infantry crosses into the beach. Luftwaffe planes come one or two at a time. There intriguing reasons for this, both environmental and strategic that I wish Nolan would have spent just a bit of time exploring.

You said it yourself, the film is about survival, not about the geopolitics.

How could the film show those things without deviating from its core purpose, to never show the Germans on screen (excepting those last few blurry, out-of-focus seconds, of course).",6ol0kp
dkl3o4g,"As someone who's studied history for years, they could have at least given people a few slides at the beginning explaining what's going on. 

People unfamiliar with history must have been ridiculously lost. They don't even use the term ""German"" once in the movie.",6ol0kp
dklkt7q,"In the interest of ""authenticity"" (maybe ""paying proper homage"" is a better way to put it) Nolan filmed those shots actually in Dunkirk and on Dunkirk Beach. And most of the Little Boats in the movie were the same ones that were part of the actual retreat from Dunkirk. Nolan thanks them in the credits.",6ol0kp
dkndgxg,"I just can't relate to all these criticisms about the characters not being relatable. Not being able to remember names -- sure, there isn't a lot of name-calling in the movie to reinforce, but you know who these people *are*. 

The father who decides to set out on his own to save brave young boys, any of whom could have been his own dear, dead son, because he can't bear sitting at home and doing nothing, with all that knowledge and courage and sense of rightness there. The agony he feels when he has to make the decision between saving one young boy that he knows personally -- somebody else's precious son -- and saving dozens of others. The pride he feels when his younger son shows mercy and compassion in an impossible moment. 

The young soldier, swept up in a battle with no honor or glory to be won, and no friends initially by his side (no mourning or agony here when the folks he's with are shot down in the streets). Nothing but survival (and taking a shit) on his mind -- straight problem-solving mode, just as you would imagine anyone (but especially at least minimally trained soldier) to be in that scenario. Runs across a silent comrade with whom he doesn't need to speak to form a connection, and they stick together first out of desperation and need, but later out of loyalty. Understands there's more to life and battle than just survival -- some things are wrong, some things are right. 

The other young soldier, similarly scrappy and full of survival instinct, but young and less concerned about ultimate morality. Knows enough to feel ashamed of his moment of cowardice (though he isn't rotten deep inside, just selfish and scared), but willing enough to turn away and reassert his place in the good of life. 

I could literally go on -- Cilian Murphy's character, the French soldier, the younger son of the yachtsman, the captain, the army officer. The most inscrutable is Hardy's character. Everyone else, I feel like we know plenty about them and their motivations, and to imagine who they were, and who they're going to be once the war is over (if they survive). ",6ol0kp

dl82msx,"There are 3 stories that cover different time periods but all reach the same climax at the same time.  All three stories look at the rescue of 300,000 British troops from France, where they had been fighting to defend France from German invasion, early in World War II (losing all these troops would have almost certainly meant that the Germans would have had a potentially successful invasion of the UK).   

The troops on the beach are waiting for rescue, the large ships they send are frequently sunk by submarines (u-boats, for undersea boats) or dive bombers.  This story begins with a retreat from the town to the beaches, builds as ships are loaded and sunk, and climaxes when they are eventually they are rescued by a flotilla of small craft.  Tommy's story is the archetype for these men.  

The second story is the story of the flotilla of small craft that crosses the English channel to pick up the troops in the first story.  The archetype for these is the Moonstone piloted by her owner, his son, and their hired hand.  Their story begins as the ships are taken by the Royal Navy, builds as they approach the destruction of Dunkirk (making rescues from sunken ships and downed aircraft) and culminates with the arrival and rescue of the troops from the beach.  

The third story is the air force that kept German bombers from destroying the ships, and firing upon the smaller ships.  This story's archetype is Tom Hardy's squadron, which shoots down several bombers and their fighter escorts.  This story begins with the squadron approaching to provide cover, builds as fuel declines and more damage and casualties occur, and climaxes as the last surviving plane is out of fuel and has shot down several bombers in the last available moments.  

The three stories build to a climax at the sinking of the Minesweeper (the smaller ship sunk second and shown several times (as witnessed by the troops onboard, the planes flying over, the people on the boats, etc).   ",6ol0kp

I don't really know what you were expecting in terms of shock, if getting shot and getting bombed at is underwhelming for you. I mean, it is a well-recorded piece of history, so there are no surprise twists or tragic events that people don't already know of. And how does it present no historical or military context? It is a significant military operation, and the movie covered it pretty well. ",6ol0kp
dld98c9,"I think that with the majority of war-related films, you get mouthfuls of drawn-out dialogue to compel the viewer, but Nolan aims to put you in the front lines in each of the micro-transactions of war. Rather than have the explosive type of film where legions of men are mowed down or bombed, it depicts war on a more human level. When you're fleeing, or when you're exhausted from swimming, or have narrowly escaped being sprayed with bullets, how much time is there for dialogue?

I think what further exemplifies this is the french character, who speaks next to no dialogue, but is very much a hero by opening the door of the sinking ship. You don't need to speak to be a hero. 

At the end of the film, the blind man handing out blankets insists that surviving is doing enough, that is the focus of this movie. That in wars, you take whatever action you can in that narrow frame (whether it is trying to cover bullet holes to prevent water from seeping in, or using your butt end of a gun to try and smash your way out of a sinking plane, or to gun down an enemy jet as your plane decends without fuel) to increase your odds of survival. Whether your are a soldier waiting on the beach, a pilot of one of few planes, or civilians bringing in small ships to save soldiers, you do your part in the war with what you are given.

I personally was changed after that movie because Dunkirk put me in the throes in a variety of desperate situations of war. During my quiet drive home all I could think about was how peaceful and quiet my world is in comparison.",6ol0kp
dlc2q8w,"> None of the characters are, well, characterized very much

With Dunkirk, everything is filed down to the bare minimum, and it feels to me like the only thing that's larger than life here is his own storytelling efforts. It's a gorgeous and spectacularly well-made film - there's no doubt about that. But I never felt a thing for it beyond distant admiration throughout the entire runtime.",6ol0kp

As for Dunkirk, I'd have to disagree with your point about the boats. Maybe they could've showed more boats at once to really sell the enormity of the operation but that would've probably been a generic CGI fest and done just for show, and it might not have fit too well. And with what we saw, I did get the ""feel good"" feeling from seeing soldiers getting onto those civilian ships. I think the disbelief, relief, and joy shown on that captain's face really helped sell the whole thing to me.

I agree with the Tom Hardy thing though. I don't get why he didn't just turn his plane around and land it on a friendly piece of the beach or the water near a boat after taking out the last guy. Maybe it was because he was just gliding at that point and he'd used the last bit of maneuverability to take out that last plane and couldn't make a safe landing in friendly territory? That's just conjecture after the fact, but it's definitely weird after a first look and felt weird when I saw it.",6ol0kp

dku8qo1,"I went to a 70mm showing and realized it wasn't what Nolan wanted me to see when the first widescreen images came up. I would say...

* There were complaints that the scale of the evacuation wasn't shown. I'm wondering if that's a widescreen problem, because a narrower screen would presumably make you think you're seeing a much smaller slice of the beach than you are. If there's a reason Nolan wants you to watch it in a narrower AR, that's probably it.
* Other than that, occasionally it was clear that certain scenes had content above and below the camera you couldn't see, but wasn't necessarily important. For example, the spitfire cockpit scenes usually had faces and even targets cropped.
* Also, FWIW, the 70mm version I saw didn't seem dramatically higher resolution than normal (perhaps because the screen was so big?) and did have film artifacts - I don't mean scratches and other ""Film has been played too many times"" things, I mean things like those large colourful blotches flickering up that are presumably a result of the development process failing.

I suspect the sound is probably a bigger factor, and some people complain that they weren't able to hear the dialog suggesting some theaters do mess that up.

Two hour round trip? Me? I'd have probably just gone for regular digital under those circumstances. But if you feel passionately about this CALL THEM BEFORE YOU GO, and verify that they're showing the correct aspect ratio.",6ol0kp
dktbdp9,"It's not. The movie was an obvious pet project that didn't have the normal Nolan movie budget. A very straightforward and *short* story that was unnecessarily cut up and disordered to build uneasiness in the viewer. It was pretty small scale and the IMAX seemed more of a gimmick to get people to pay more for a pretty average war movie. There was mention of 400,000 men on the beach and evacuation of 300,000 but there was never more than a few hundred on screen at once. If normal theaters were good enough for Saving Private Ryan then they surely suffice for Dunkirk.",6ol0kp

dku5nic,"He ran out of fuel. Fuel that made his engine run. The engine also pressurizes the hydraulic fluid that operates the landing gear. Without pressure, he had to hand pump a secondary, emergency circuit of hydraulic fluid to lower his landing gear. Juggling that task with gliding the plane down safely probably took him a bit.

Here's a small diagram of part of the hydraulic system for a [Spitfire](http://forum.keypublishing.com/attachment.php?s=8ed9513da23f3ff45db305780f8335e4&attachmentid=182914&stc=1&d=1268312809)

Planes also take quite a bit of runway to clear a landing. He probably didn't want to smash into any of the soldiers.

He is probably the most selfless character in that whole movie, now that I think about it.",6ol0kp

I realize it was a thematic choice, but surely some of those people could see his prop wasn't spinning let alone not making any noise.

dkx2vis,"In my version of events, he chose to keep gliding as a morale boost for the troops bellow him.

He does it knowing full well that he won't be able to make it back at that point. The self-sacrifice of the British people when faced with annihilation. 

And the final flyover of the beach was fantastic. While gliding, he has somehow saved the day (as heroic and unexpected as civilian boats saving the men at dunkirk). But even after he's shot down the german planes, he is out of gas and falling, you don't know if he (or Great Britain) will survive.

I feel like that's apples and oranges. I haven't personally seen any internet comment or review that claims Dunkirk should be on the 'greatest war movie' pedestal (although ""greatest war film *since* Saving Private Ryan [1998]"" is a very fair, but obviously subjective opinion). Dunkirk is something different. Refreshingly experimental for a war epic, IMO, but not to be directly compared to those greats of the past, some of which are straight character studies -- the antithesis of what this movie is supposed to be.

This precious time allowed the armies to escape.,6ol0kp
dl3i6f6,"One reason is that the German tanks had gotten extremely extended in terms of supply lines. Tanks are not fuel efficient so fuel has to be moved behind them. There were French armored elements probing at this supply line from both three birth and south, which made the Germans nervous about getting their tanks cut off from a supply line. Ad to that that the tanks had been on the change for a solid weekand were breaking down, and you can see why they would be cautious with suck a previous resource. Basically, the longer you stretch a blade, the more brittle it is.
The German infantry was something like 80 percent horse powered or on foot, so not the same problem with fuel and maintainence.
The heroism of the rear guard is often lauded, but there were soundly beaten French tankers who were willing to strike south at the superior panzer corp after it had already cut through their country..

dkn9ztc,"I agree. Same issues I had with Interstellar. It's obviously a choice by Nolan to avoid plot and characterisation but in my opinion, the very best of the best have both. The film relied too heavily on Zimmer's score.",6ol0kp
dkigauk,"I'd really like to hear what stood out the second time. I was really disappointed when I saw it and agree with most of the critism. Ive got no intention of going back to watch it, but I'd absolutely love to know what you saw on the second viewing that changed your mind. (If you're worried about spoiling details for people, just spoiler tag it. I would love to know.) ",6ol0kp
dkktsvq,"To be fair though, it's not a documentary - it's historical dramatization. 

In terms of the black beach - that's a limit of the production and the number of extras - they have to consider the budget.

Body parts - they're not going to put in body parts because that pushes rating, which affects accessibility which in turn affects the box office pull. 

I think ending the film on a realistic note (elation, etc.) might have undercut the theme - rather than be 100% accurate to the event, it was meant to convey a message about the toll of war overall.

Just my thoughts.",6ol0kp
dkn9897,"Personally, I didn't even notice the lack of gore. I was so on-edge due to the sountrack and the horrible tension in the characters that I think, at one point, blood spatter and stuff like that would just be distracting. 

I'm all for blood and realism in movies, and all in all, most of the stuff happening at sea wouldn't benefit from blood, aside from maybe a slight colouring of the water. The scenes with the soldiers covered in oil was all the gore I needed :)",6ol0kp
dknf4af,"I didn't feel the need of gore in this movie. The tension of the scenes and sound design were enough to show us the horror of war. 

To be honest it's only after seeing the movie that I saw it was PG13 and then thinking back ""damn, that's true, there was hardly any blood in this movie"". ",6ol0kp
dko4700,"> Making it difficult for many in the audience to understand dialogue throughout the entire movie and declaring it a ""style choice"" is bullshit.

I didn't really have any issue hearing it myself in the theater, but in all honesty, how many scenes even _needed_ dialogue?  I can think of the scene in the boat to understand why they would try to shoot their own soldier and the bits between the guy's son and Cillian Murphy.",6ol0kp
dkia38n,"There's nothing wrong with feeling that way at all. I've often found the best films I've seen left me feeling conflicted. It only becomes clear days later after you've processed everything. I certainly don't think it's related to an oversaturation of 'crap' as others have mentioned.

My biggest praise of the film was the choice never to show the enemy, only the effect of the enemy. It really helped me feel what it must have been like to be there. It was just a constant feeling of being surrounded.

That *could* easily be argued as a mistake, or weakness, and I don't think anybody would be objectively wrong or right in saying so.",6ol0kp

Quite frankly I found it BORING. I know people here are going to say that's because I'm some plebian who would rather watch a dumb Michael Bay movie full of explosions than a suspenseful movie like this, but oh well. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I think that's not true at all. Honestly, this movie on TV would be really boring, the only thing that makes it good is the intense visuals and sound, but take away those emotional pulls and there's virtually nothing to engage your brain. There's minimal dialogue and plot. It's just Dunkirk was very scary and everyone desperately wanted to escape and in the end most of them did with the help of the heroic actions of local sailors and the RAF. Great story, but very very simple.",6ol0kp
dkiiko5,"It's because the movie really isn't as good as people think. Don't get me wrong, I love CN and I enjoyed this movie, but the decision to tell the story in a non linear way and focus more on the events rather than characters makes it impossible to invest any emotion. It's easily the most beautifully shot war movie ever, and those shots from the fighter planes are spectacular, but the rest of the film seems like one boat capsizing after another without any real theme or message to take away.",6ol0kp

I went on kind of a Nolan kick leading up to seeing it (Prestige, Memento, Dark Knight, although I've seen all his other films multiple times) and when I saw Dunkirk it didn't feel the same. I had a fear going in that would happen since it's a true story, but I figured that would be ok because the good would outweigh the potential negatives. It just... didn't though. 

Incredibly well made, but still just ehh. Which really bums me out.",6ol0kp
dkl1avn,"I think it's just what you're looking for in a film. Two of my friends preferred Inception due to its imaginative plot, but I enjoyed Dunkirk more because I enjoy realism and I like that the film made you feel like you were almost there (for me at least). ",6ol0kp
dkrbqv0,"As a WWII aviation buff this is disheartening to read. It doesn't have to be actual physics and ""real"" dogfighting, but some realism would help. And this sounds like it will take me out of the movie as well.

dkq598i,Just got back from the movie and I felt the same! It was a spectacularly done sequence of moments that all rang hollow for me.  ,6ol0kp
dkq6pck,I think it has to do with expectation. Dunkirk was essentially a documentary but instead of some old guy talking over black and white photos Nolan put you into the chaos. I must admit though I was disappointed to not have some sort of subplot within the event. ,6ol0kp
dkrgx6z,"I believe it was shot in such a way to make the viewer ""a character in the film."" YOU are supposed to feel like you're there, like you're trying to get out of Dunkirk, like the bullets are whizzing past YOUR face.

As to the lack of urgency you felt; I can't really speak to that. I personally felt the urgency in the hopelessness of the situation. 400,000 men trapped on a beach with an enemy closing in from the east, every boat could be destroyed at any time by a bomber, u-boat, etc, the lack of supplies and the paranoia that anything could ""get you"" at any time.",6ol0kp
dkq6x7n,"I saw it and I agree, but with that being said I believe that hollow feeling is kind of representative of the feeling soldiers may get after experiencing so many life and death experiences.  There wasn't much character development but I think it may be the fact that in war it's not all about individual men, but teams, units, battalions etc...  and that all men share that same emotion of fear of death, and to fight or flight for your life. The shell-shocked soldier in the ship was representative of what men go through because of such traumatic events.",6ol0kp
dkr0tfr,"Honestly, I feel the same way. I watched this last night with my boyfriend, who LOVES war films, and the ones I've seen with him have been decently good. But this one just felt... boring. It was hard to get so invested in characters I knew nothing about. I didn't know/ remember any of their names.

I feel that was Nolan's point in making the movie, in that the soldiers were just nobodies trying to survive, with no time to make friends, or something like that, so we as an audience were able to experience what it was probably like for them. It doesn't make for an engaging movie, though.

Everything else was great, the music, the tension, the cinematography. Honestly, if Nolan's name weren't attached, I don't think it would be as well received.",6ol0kp
dkqllei,"I hated it

I don't get it

The constant tick tick ticking of the clock annoyed me

And I really couldn't care less who died on the beach tbh",6ol0kp
dkqvshr,"That's the problem with this movie. Nolan could have both developed characters and attempt to put audiences in the story as you describe. He's skilled enough to it, but chose not to.",6ol0kp
dkspwky,"This may be splitting hairs, but I'm in between the camps of thought on this one. I don't think more character development was necessary to empathize with the movie, however, more dialogue would have made it feel more realistic and relatable. If the strafing on the beach had interrupted some random conversation we overhear walking by a group of soldiers, that would have been more realistic and immersive. Instead my overall impression of the movie is a bunch of loud explosions, visceral moments where people almost die, and a void of human sound. I don't remember any screaming when people died on the beach (dry eyes when George dies), no gore despite the blood on the pipe the kid falls on, and no one shows any sense of mourning watching their comrades die while just waiting to go home. I got more of the feeling that Nolan had no empathy in making a movie on this topic so intense, but so devoid of humanity. That being said, it was still an impactful movie, but only for the sensorial elements like sound and the raw scenes where people die/almost die via drowning/fire/etc.",6ol0kp
dkqy6v9,[deleted],6ol0kp
dkqspj8,"Empathy? Character development is important to the story, and without it the story seems pointless. I didn't feel attached when watching this movie because I didn't really understand or know any of the characters. People shouldn't be expected to feel something for a person they don't know at all. Not to mention that there's constant death, and I'm not going to feel something each time someone dies.  ",6ol0kp
dkv4cx8,"This is so interesting to me, since I have the exact opposite feeling about Dunkirk. Not saying your opinion is wrong or anything like that, different people will always enjoy different movies for different reasons.

I like that the focus of this movie is on the stuff happening and not about some fictional character talking about his wife, getting bullied in school or something completely different that has no relevance to the plot.

I still had a lot of empathy for the characters and found the movie really engaging and worth my money.

I also felt that the movie was a good way to give people a glimpse into the horror and tension that went on in Dunkirk without getting all Hollywood-like and having people do emotional monologues while looking at the sky. In the moments we saw, there was only time for survival, and I liked how we got to see different people react to these circumstances.",6ol0kp
dku44w2,"I concur.

The lack of room for people to put some empathy on this piece left a strange taste on my tastebud. After all this film is not intended to drive audience into another reality, but rather depicting something as clear as possible. The visual and the sound design are terrific, but the shallowness of the story is kinda bothers me.",6ol0kp
dku9xc8,"Totally agree. I get that he was trying to do something different and non-linear, but the movie was pretty pedestrian. The biggest quibble for me for how the movie failed to convey the true scale of Dunkirk. 340,000 men were evacuated, not 10,000. But hey, to each his own.",6ol0kp
dkubd1n,"It misses the human element is what it is.  The only attachment or connection I felt to anyone in the film was the father and son and friend and that was because there was actual dialogue in their scenes. Not a lot, but it was enough to make me care about them. Everything else was just spectacle. The  people that argue against this with ""DURRHH WELL IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE SAVING PRIVATE RYAN DURRRHHH""  miss the point. It doesn't have to be like that. It just has to make the human characters in the movie feel like human characters. Most of them don't so most of the time I didn't give a shit about any of them or what they were going through while watching it. 

Like you say, in the purest technical sense the movie is great. Visually, sound design, soundtrack. All top notch. But without really anything to connect to it's just like watching a really good fireworks show. It's nice and pretty but it doesn't last with you. The problem is this movie was about arguably the most important, most heroic event of the war. It should make you feel something more than ""Oh well.... it looked great.""   Someone in an earlier comment compared this to Schindler's List. I wonder if they watched *either* movie.  ",6ol0kp
dkvbwtb,Why do many who rate low say. I am a fan of Nolan and this was my favorite movie. Don't they realize NOlan's filmography is so accessible that at least 2 films are in their top 5?

I'm fine with the lack of characterization; this film was all about inserting the filmgoer into the film and coming up with unnecessary plot filler would have detracted from that, in my opinion.  You're not supposed to care about the characters, just imagine what it would be like if you were in that position.  At least that's my take on it.

I do agree with you on the Nolan timeline fuckery.  A *slight* bit was cool, it was kind of awesome to see things play out from an aerial view and then on a more personal level from the sea/ground.  But Nolan just did it a little too hard/much.",6ol0kp

All of the characters who survived melted away into the crowds at the end, crowds of people with their own horrific stories.",6ol0kp
dkwzm42,"Largely, I think this is because there is literally no character development. It's not a traditional movie in the sense of buildup, character conflict, etc. I feel like the main character's name was mentioned once or twice but I honestly can't remember. Most people don't get names.

I think this was definitely intentional though, and it's a decision I can respect. There's no drama or character conflict, not anything longer than a scene or two, because the backdrop of war *is* the entire movie. It's just a bunch of people in the middle of a war doing what they can to survive/do the right thing, and honestly I kinda feel like that was a good decision. There's no progression until the characters are safe, which I suppose is how you'd feel in a war. Doing anything you can to survive, everything after is what matters.

I haven't actually seen saving private ryan, but from what I've heard, it managed to do all of that^ and still have traditional character involvement/conflict/progression. More of a traditional movie. So you could argue Nolan did make a mistake somewhere in there?",6ol0kp

I didn't know why or what they had gone through or were going to go through so it all left the movie tasting stale ",6ol0kp

Sometimes while watching Dunkirk, I wanted the actual sounds of the ships and spitfires or the soldiers rather than the constant loud ticking. Else, the film was terrific. ",6ol0kp

dkww7xa,"The music when the ""little boats"" arrive is strikingly cheerful, in contrast to the music in the rest of the film.  I thought slightly too cheerful, actually.

I don't understand it perfectly, but my guess would be he was out there on the last hour of evacuation, and landed when he was out of gas and could see that the beach was empty.

A couple comments: I don't get the ""they're hated back in England"" part. I guess I missed something there. They seemed welcomed/celebrated to me. Agreed that ""we made it home"" was all he needed for a resolution. The end of Tom Hardy's story didn't bother me. Was badass. But I'm annoyed he didn't turn around and park his plane next to the troops awaiting departure! I think you're making more out of the old captain running from the Navy than necessary. That was like a 10 second scene. That said, it would have been a lot better imo if the Navy comes over to his boat, he insists on taking her to Dunkirk himself, and the Navy acquiesces.

Yes! I thought I was the only one who noticed this. Like I was completely riveted during the first few, especially the one where Harry gets saved, when it like pushes up against the wooden deck.

I agree with the characters being undeveloped in an emotional way but holy fuck I felt a lot. It was all about chaos. The young soldier didn't even know the French soldier, did they even say their name. He met him burring someone. It highlights the coldness of war for me.

Walking out of the theater, my first impression was that it's ~100 minutes of the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan, minus any of the rest of it. The plot of the movie is how 300K soldiers are evacuated, not about some individual band of plucky adventurers. 99% of the individuals onscreen are conscripts and they all share the same goal, which is to get the hell out of Dodge. The emphasis is on the collective, rather than the individual. Which seems entirely appropriate for WWII.",6ol0kp

The soldier character finds little breaks in tea and bread with jam, finding a friendly defensive position, a nervous light sleep inside an abandoned trawler, hiding underneath the pier, finally getting on a boat home Tension releases but not completely.

This happened in both interstellar and Dunkirk in the IMAX.  I still haven't gotten around to renting Interstellar, which maybe I'll do today.

To me it felt very close to a movie trying to capture the intensity of Saving private Ryan's opening scene as a film in itself. I will admit I want to watch it again to see if the second time through is as engaging. 

If you re-watch the beginning of the air scenes it has Hardy with his mask off and you can see him. In fact I joked that Hardy really loves movies where he has to emote with his eyes to the viewers, which is something he seems to be getting good at. I can however see why you felt him replaceable. ",6ol0kp
dkzg4y1,">  Hell, I didn't even understand that Tom Hardy was the pilot till the end, he was completely replaceable

I think that's actually what Nolan was aiming for. Most  war films love to show the protagonists as chiseled, instantly recognisable Hollywood veterans, for example Fury has Brad Pitt, Saving Private Ryan has Tom Hanks and Matt Damon, Bradley Cooper in American Sniper, Mel Gibson in every Vietnam film ever, and so on. Nolan does the opposite by casting the majority of the actors as relatively unknown young men, which would've been the reality of Dunkirk. The majority of people who signed up were between 18 and 25. Just boys in comparison to say Brad Pitt or Tom Hanks.

By doing this it allows us to focus on the events rather than the characters. This is very much a film where the characters exist as a medium for the story to be told through, rather than the other way around as films that focus more on character development are. 

Dunkirk was a film about what happened at Dunkirk, it's not about x, y, and z character and their story, that's why it's not desperately important that the characters play a deep and meaningful part. They seem replaceable because they're meant to be replaceable. How many 100s of small ships were there? How many spitfires were flown over the battle? And how many 100s of 1000s of young men were there on the beaches?

The film is about all of them, but tells all of their stories from the perspective of a select few of them.",6ol0kp
dkyh2a6,"Don't think the characters were suppose to have any meaningful impact. The fact that they never showed any of the enemies faces, adds to that they didnt try to make an antagonist/protagonist. And they hardly had any lines.

I think if you see it again you will change your mind. I think a lot of the things you said make sense if you were expecting something.

I love that Tom Hardy didnt even show his face. He is a hige star and could have made it so his face was shown more often but he didnt and that is awesome.

I disagree with you but i upvoted you because you discussed the movie like you are suppose to.",6ol0kp
dkigfxt,"Totally agree. I think a big thing for me was that just because I believed the main characters were legitimately in danger, doesn't mean I cared. 

Without names or personalities (During the film, the only name I knew was George) I couldn't see past the actors, so I never felt worried for their safety. If they died, so what? They're actors. They get paid. 

I need characters in my films. People are calling this a realistic war film, but part of the tragedy of war is that every single casualty has a story. Hopes and dreams and struggles and triumphs. To me, they were nothing more than actors. I've slaughtered hundreds of nameless NPCs in games, and the main characters were no more interesting to me than the people getting killed behind them. 

That would be an achievement if I'd felt emotional about the guy getting killed behind them, but I didn't. ",6ol0kp

Wonderfully shot and epic, but overall kind of dull.   You can't criticize a movie like this without seeming like you are criticizing the historical event.  Also, Nolan in general has an army of fanboys who think he can do no wrong - so it's gonna be hard to get your voice heard ... but I agree with you.

2. Landing behind enemies lines= bad idea duh 
3. When you have no engine power, your options are really limited 
4. Geneva conventions meant he likely would survive capture 
5. He had no idea how good or bad ground status was so landing on beach with nearby allies was best he could hope for and make sure the spitfire didn't fall into enemy hands. ",6ol0kp
dklcfq4,"I think it also could have been that he might have ended up hitting people on the stretch that the allies were occupying (especially since the french had still not been evacuated), planes need at least a couple thousand meters to land, so even if he did aim for them (which I'm not sure was possible without the use of an engine) he probably would have ended up close to or out of the safe zone anyways, and I think it's safe to say that he might have landed in a previously safe zone but due to the fact that the french were evacuated to the beaches, and the German forces were already closing in, the boarders could have shifted and he just got there at a bad time. ",6ol0kp
dkliw1w,"Actually he was gliding, so he had to burn off speed to make an emergency landing.  

If you watch how he did it in the movie he went down to the East and ran along the beach with the soldiers and was intending to flip back around the mole area and land on the beach.  Instead of doing that he turned early and went after the stuka and then didn't burn off enough speed...putting him more to the east outside of the perimeter.  

So basically he runs out of fuel in the east, runs west along the beach in view of the soldiers and was planning to make a wide loop around the mole to burn off speed and land on the beach with the soliders.  Instead he turns early, takes out the stuka and misses the landing area.

Also I'm not exactly sure if he landed on a beach.  I thought I saw grass in the movie.  It would make sense for him to want to land in dirt/grass since the plane would be able to roll on it.  Landing on sand would be similar to water and it would immediately bring him to a stop.

Additionally The Mole takes like a week while the other stories take an hour but it all seems to happen at the same time.

This allowed a significant portion of the British army to escape.  If Hitler's army just kept moving to wipe out the British, the Germans probably win the war.

That being said I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the movie. I felt there was a definite sense of urgency, but I can see how you wouldn't have picked up on it. 

I thought the plots they chose worked well. To focus on the French side of the battle in the city would have pulled away I think from the movie. This was the story of the broken and demoralised British army being evacuated, not the valiant effort to hold the line. I feel the French would deserve their own entire movie to handle that, a la Flags of Our Father's and Letters From Iwo Jima. Which would be a very good way IMO for this battle to be depicted.

For your first point, that's a fantastic idea. I wholeheartedly agree that a French hold the line or push back sequence littered through the movie showing the progress of the German assault would have kept the viewer much more invested and wouldn't have required such an annoying use of the ever-suspenseful score.

In the panic to get off the beach, one of the soldiers realized that with less weight on board they would start floating quicker. Of course, no one wanted to volunteer to get off which is when Harry Styles character picked on the quiet soldier accusing him of being a spy since he had practically said nothing up to that point in the movie.

I mean what if your complaint about not having any reason to care about what happened to a single character was sort of the point? I think that the cinematography and sound allowed the viewer to realistically empathize with the terror and anxiety that you would expect. I also think that the cold, almost chess-piece depiction of the soldiers allowed the viewer to care about them in a way that I would expect the soldiers on the ground thought they were being cared about by their leaders. I mean, if you're sitting on the beach waiting in a line for a navy that isn't coming, unprotected by an airforce because it isn't coming, all after being pushed back by what must have seemed to be a more formidable enemy, you've got to feel like the people above you making decisions don't really give a shit about you. 

By contrast, I think that the fact the viewer (or just me maybe) cared at all about George was because he was meant to be the exact opposite of the soldiers on the beach. He was the british public. Blinded (literally from a shell-shocked soldier who had experienced it and did not want to go back) from the reality of the situation and then given a cover-up story to appease his own sense of self/accomplishment/history. His personality and likability make you feel a sort of paternal (and frankly ridiculous) sympathy for his character as compared to the soldiers. That makes for a nice story just like the basic story of the Dunkirk evacuation was that ""a bunch of soldiers were trapped in France and some Civilians saved them and felt good about themselves for like 75 years"" but the real story was probably a lot more terrifying and and anxious and miserable and tedious than the highschool textbook version. I think the movie helped me understand that and so I think it was a good movie.

The solider who almost gets left behind on the dock because he, um... was he taking a nap? All of the fucking jump scares with random gunfire out of nowhere that added nothing to the story?

I was not impressed. It was not a war movie as much as a Chris Nolan war movie. I keep thinking how Spielberg would have filmed the Battle of Dunkirk. I believe he would have done more background on the battle, shown more German soldiers, thrown Churchill into the plot, and given the characters more depth. Action is necessary, of course (especially in a war movie), but I think meaningful dialogue between the characters in the movies is equally important.

We saw so many ships sink that I had the impression that almost every British soldiers died there. In reality, most of them survived.

Showing to us that there is indeed hope would have worked much better than making the impression that everyone will die anyway. Nolan should know that.

How much conventional character development could you hope to see when you are only given a snapshot of 1 hour sliced out of these characters' lives? I can't think of any film that has a character who's entire arc takes place over the course of 1 hour in the story's timeline (usually there are time jumps, pauses, etc that give the character time to flesh out their experiences, in Dunkirk, the film is the entirety of their experiences in a precise moment). Given this limitation I think Nolan did an amazing job revealing to you the kind of man Hardy's Farrier was: calm under pressure (not one moment of panic), selfless (risks his life to save his fellow soldiers when he's out of fuel), total badass (sets his own plane on fire so nothing can be studied or reused by the Germans and stares down the dozens of soldiers rushing to capture him without even so much as flinching)",6ol0kp

[""Also omitted were Winston Churchill and any scenes of generals in a war room, as Nolan did not want to get ""bogged down in the politics of the situation"".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkirk_\(2017_film\)#Development)

The whole point of the movie was to build suspense by putting you on the ground, in the air, and over water without knowing the bigger picture. All that you care about at this point is getting home safely, while you see people getting killed by bullets, or bombs, or drowning all around you. 

This movie's main aim is to give you a panic attack when you feel yourself on a little boat, or on a bridge waiting to board a ship, when all of a sudden you first hear, then see a German plane coming at you full speed. You don't know where the bullets will go, where the bombs will land. And all the while you hear the terrifying sound the planes make while they're diving right for you.

The suspense building was insane. [The pilot stuck in the plane while water starts flowing in, the boat scene where it starts floating on its own while Germans are using it as target practice, and the second last + last scene involving Hardy in his plane ](#spoiler) are some of the most keeping-you-on-the-edge-of-you-seat experiences I've ever had.",6ol0kp

What bothers me about are two things: (1) shoehorning the little feel-good arc of the newspaper story after George says that's he wanted. Just cut out the part where George directly says he wants to be in the paper and it's fine -- kid goes to war, needlessly dies in noncombat, society's impulse is to sort of rejigger the situation to make it sound like heroism, putting a noble spin on it.

Also (2), I don't quite understand the narrative purpose of having the British soldier (Cillian Murphy) being at fault for injuring George. He feels bad, asks if he's okay, turns passive for the rest of his screentime, and is lied to about George's condition. It seems like more interesting could have been done with Murphy's character.

As a viewer I felt zero sense of urgency for the main characters. The scope of the film was missing completely. You see a thousand soldiers on the beach at most and in the end we see maybe 20 civilian boats come to the rescue. All of a sudden the beaches are empty and the day is saved. The British LTC mentions the eastern border of the city once to make us aware that the Germans are breaking threw, which I thought was lazy.

Who was the enemy again? /s.

The music was loud and blocked the little dialogue the movie had. The editing was weird, they randomly jumped back a few minutes in the Sea and Air portions with little addition to the plot.  

The 3 plots where pretty boring and the Air portion seemed irrelevant. Three better story arcs IMO would be: 

1. The battle in the city with a French perspective, which would in turn give us a sense of urgency for those on the beach and the scale of what was at stake.

2. The real battle in the sky which took place miles away from the beaches. This could easily have been tide together by following the few planes that break through and hit the beach. Again showing us the scope of the chaos around Dunkirk.

3. Combining the civilian ""Sea"" story with the ""Mole"" to return us to the so what of the movie and follow the amazing withdraw and recovery of 300,000+ soldiers.

It's meant to sort of put you there in the action and feel on edge with the characters. I can see what it was trying to do and imo having the developed characters that we have to have emotions for and them then inevitably dying would've cheapened it a bit. But at the same time I can see why a lot of people wouldn't enjoy just the experience and would prefer more of a story. In a way I guess it could come down to personal preference - I preferred this over to say Inception.

We are supposed to see the main hero as one of the many indistinguishable soldiers on the beach (notice all the soldiers have raven black hair. ALL OF THEM. Only the main characters of Peter, Collins and Farrier break the theme). We are not supposed to see the hero's lifestory or psychological warfare in this single unique soldier. He is not a hero at all actually. He is the main protagonist, yes that's the right word. He is not a hero, he never did do anything special or heroic. He is one of many. We are supposed to see him as one of the ~400k soldiers, he was picked absolutely randomly.

The whole movie is set to feel epic and idyllic - everything is nice and polished, no debris, no gore or blood, the streets completely clean. There was only one citizen in Dunkirk the whole movie! The Dutch guy!

Telling the story prior the events in Dunkirk would definitely disrupt the atmosphere Nolan tries to build since the very first scene (there is not a single German soldier seen the entire movie...yeah, a scene in the very end shows a few, but that's all). We are supposed to be set right into the scenery of hope, fear and anxiety without any disruptions which would the introduction to the events before the movie definitely be. Giving an introduction would provide a distraction for the viewer, he could start to think various stuff about the war and ultimately get distracted (e. g.

Prop plane. But yes, WWII fighters had the ability to glide over a fair amount of distance. Most planes do have glider capability.

dkic3cc,"ALL planes (fixed wing at least) can glide for a VERY long time honestly.

Lift is a VERY powerful force and is really the majority of the reason why planes can even fly. 

What the engine is really doing is just that initial burst of acceleration needed to generate enough LIFT in the beginning (surprise surprise) and then to maintain JUST barely enough 'propulsion force' to keep the force of LIFT high enough to maintain 'vertical stability'.

Most scenes which are shot on IMAX 65mm have to be dubbed over in post, however because it's the highest quality format out there Nolan loves shooting on it which is why he's also utilised them for some of the below decks with the soldier character.

3. One German is spotted because he chasing one of the pilots. (""He's On Me, I'm on Him""
3. German is shot down. 
4. 1 Spitfire is missing (""Do you copy Red Leader?"")
5. They see their leader in the water, shot down.
6. While they record the position (no parachute) a 2nd German plane shoots at Tom Hardy which then hit his gas gauge. 

This is why they proceed higher in altitude even though it risks the fuel. He says ""I don't want them to come down us again""

It's confusing because the third pilot (red leader) doesn't even show it's pilot nor his supposed fight with the german who shot him down. Even harder when you cut in between these fights.](#spoiler)

* that kid doesn't die
* the shellshocked soldier doesn't hurt anyone else, or himself

* that pilot makes it out
* no more ships are lost 
* that kid's father and brother aren't traumatized even more than they already are

There was so much rooting I was almost rooted out. Having a named hero gives him plot armor and the tension is almost superficial because you know the hero almost never dies.

In this movie I felt that anyone could die at any moment. 

Seriously. I half expected the Moonstone to get bombed in sight of port and the last shot to be Mr. Stiffupperlip slowly sinking into the abyss.

They'd die unknown and without fanfare.

 It was a movie about survival. An old man should not be sailing into a war zone to rescue soldiers, but he did what he had to do.

At the end of the movie its clear that for many of the characters involved, whatever their story was before did not matter in the end. ",6ol0kp

As someone who loves watching sad depressing movies to really give myself pause and reflect a bit, I loved Dunkirk. 

I really appreciate when a movie immerses me in the situation emotionally and mentally. My pits were drenched in sweat out of anxiety the whole time I was watching the movie and I kind of loved it. I was thinking about things I've been complaining about over the last couple months and how lucky I am to only have those complaints. I appreciate when a movie under 2 hours can effect me like that. 

It's not a traditional film in the sense that it's not a story, it's an experience. You are really meant to connect with the mindset and the emotions of the soldiers featured rather than be told a story about them. At least, that's what I gather. Of course if that's not what you're into, I totally see where you're coming from.

You seem to have missed the entire point of the movie. It was tension, terror, trauma, loss of ego and identity, futility against the will to survive and heroism.

That was my problem too. I didn't really know any of these characters and therefore didn't care whether they died or not with exception of the old guy on the boat.

I know Nolan said the whole point of the movie was about survival, not who these people were - but part of what makes the audience root for someone's survival or empathize with them is by telling us who they are.

Interstellar had one of the best character moments in recent blockbuster cinematic history - when Coop watches the videos after being on the water planet for 30 years.

If the Stuka doesn't notice Tom, or believes, like you, that he's unable to attack it, it will ignore it and straight bomb. This allows Tom's Spitfire to go into a dive at the Stuka, and, because he knows it's exact diving path, estimate the lead distance he needs to get it.

Hardy was flying a brownish/greenish Supermarine Spitfire Mark 1. The aircraft he was shooting at were all German. As far as I saw there were no French aircraft featured in the movie. The single engine fighters he was shooting at were all German Messerschmitt Me-109s.  The twin engine bombers were Heinkel HE-111s. Those were the big ones trying to bomb the ships. The aircraft bombing the beaches that made those loud siren noises were Junkers Ju-87 Stuka dive bombers.

(Disclaimer I'm not an expert just a history nerd. If anyone reads this and sees that I have made a mistake please do correct me!)

Fun added fact two of those Spitfires (british planes) were actual real WW2 era Mark 1 spitfires. The third one was an early model mark 5 which is basically a mark 1 with a more powerful engine. Almost visually indistinguishable from a mark 1. The Mark 1 was the type used in the time period the movie is set.  The real deal. The real sound of those engines. Makes the movie more special if you are in to that sort of thing.
Sadly they couldn't do the same with the German aircraft though they did get very close. They were using a Spanish postwar copy of the German Me-109. So while not completely accurate it is very close and from a distance or during fast paced scenes (so basically every time we see one) it is almost impossible to tell that it isn't a real Me-109 unless you knew ahead of time.",6ol0kp

Initially I was very excited to see this movie as the trailers made it look very interesting and Christopher Nolan is fairly consistent at making great films, but I'm not one to fanboy a particular director or actors even. With that being said, I thought this movie was an absolute bore. 
Throughout the movie you ""meet"" many different characters, yet these characters don't feel very developed. They're just another sheep in the herd. There is never any emotional connection established with any of the characters which makes their deaths and hardships feel meaningless.
The action sequences in the movie were quite underwhelming in action and overwhelming in volume. I got pretty excited when the fighter pilots joined the scene as I usually love watching dogfights but with this movie.... This movie ruined it. Most boring dogfight sequences of any movie. Although, I must admit, [the scene towards the end when the pilot runs out of gas and takes down enemy pilot was pretty noteworthy. The fact that he made it out alive and suffered no injuries or even a scratch made it feel like it wasn't even a big risk or even worth including.] (#spoiler)

The Thin Red Line although a big, sweeping production, seemed to try to cram too much into it, and I wasn't a fan of the casting. Quite good, but not a favourite of mine. 
Dunkirk isn't for everyone. It felt more like a thriller, with this unseen enemy ready to annihilate the guys at any time. Personally, I loved it, but maybe because I'm British and this story is embedded into our collective memory, with the 'Dunkirk Spirit' being spoken about so much.

-The oil burning scene is when all 3 timelines converge. They're out of sync beforehand (Cillian Murphy reveal obviously, etc), and out of sync afterwards (end of the pilot arc intertwined with the newspapers on the train)

-And the entire service of the convergence on this scene is to add suspense to the fate of Tommy (in the ""land"" timeline we see him trapped under the oil slick with no hope, but only in the ""sea"" timeline it's revealed that he's the very last person dragged away from the slick.)",6ol0kp

Tommy and Alex, among thousands of others, had just been through hell at Dunkirk and barely made it back to England, but Churchill's speech, stirring as it might be for the civilians waving at the train, means they'll be going straight back across the Channel, in the pursuit of victory.

It's one thing to lead a target when you're still but when you're both moving relative to one another the bullets will retain a bunch of your instantaneous state. So if you're both banking hard left and you lead your target, your bullets can still miss to the right because they're retaining your momentum from when they first leave the plane.",6ol0kp

That wasn't a huge. If anything, the [Spitfire taking down a bomber while gliding](#spoiler) was.

> Can someone tell me why this scene was not just a useless piece of suspense for the sake of it.

What sake should suspense be for? The whole point of the film is to make the viewer live the same emotions the soldiers did. The tension is necessary... and in any case, I don't see why this scene would be any less necessary than the others.

Can't say I was a huge fan of the scene switching, but it was done well enough.

> Great they have to get to the boat, oh no its going to leave run faster. I've seen this shit a million times before and it was simply boring. 

To each his own, I guess.

How? The effects were pretty spot on, with no silly explosions, and it portrayed the nature of WW2 aerial warfare pretty neat.

> Also the scene where they are in the beach boat getting shot at. ""Oh theres water coming into the boat, go put your fucking face in front of the holes bitch lol surely you won't get shot"" Guess you could explain that with stupid kids/ fog of war. Whatever.

Fog of war is a different thing. Also, if they hadn't tried to plug the holes, they'd have sunk. The idea was to try to plug them hoping the Germans would just stop shooting already.

dkj484c,"Per Christopher Nolan on George -  
*I had read a couple of different accounts of real people, young people, who went over to Dunkirk. And one of the things that struck me as very sad is the way in which they would be memorialized. Or the way in which they would be portrayed as heroes. In some ways, it made you feel good but, in other ways, it made you feel that there was a real pathos, there's a real sense of, you know, what good does it do, somebody whose life's been cut short, to refer to them as a hero? To put them in a newspaper or whatever. For me, that tension is very analogous to the bigger idea of what Dunkirk means.*

*I wanted some sense of conflict to that. You completely understand it, but you feel conflicted about it. You feel both things at the same time. You feel that somebody in some ways has stepped up and done something great. But then the actual essense of it is pathetic and small and unimportant. And that scale in warfare or in any big geopolitical event is fascinating to me in terms of point of view. The film to me is not about individual heroism. You can have a bunch of people who are acting primarily in their own self-interest and very small in their concerns and really worrying about how to get from A to B. But, overall as a community, there's something that's taking place that's very admirable, and that tension I think is interesting.*

*...There's a fascinating thing that happened at the test screenings. We were consistently getting the complaint that people weren't quite sure they'd understood how George dies, or at what moment... It's just not enough for people. They completely understand what's happened. They would write on the card: I didn't quite understand that he hit his head on the thing. So, you go: No, you totally get it. It's just not much.* ",6ol0kp
dkj0ytm,"I think the entire point of the film is that War is horribly messy, hopeless, and beyond an individual's control, and that it's not always a man's valiant action that makes a hero, but the spirit that compels him to act at all in the face of grave danger. George wasn't called a hero because he saved anyone, he was called a hero because he was willing to risk his life to try to help.",6ol0kp
dkizyou,"I think the point of that was to show that not all casualties of war are in battle, and people often die for stupid reasons. The reason he was in the paper was because when he was dying, he told the blonde kid he wanted to make the paper to make his dad proud. ",6ol0kp

So, his choice is either, the beach or an airfield inland...

He lands on the beach, its the safest option allowing him to land and then scuttle the aircraft. He's an officer, so he will be captured by the germans and held as a POW in somewhat decent conditions.

He tries to find an airfield? Ok, hes in the most obviously iconic British plane ever built, with no fuel, flying over a territory occupied by one of the quickest, most efficient, most lethal armies ever seen. He has himself, and whatever weapons on board namely air to air weapons. I don't really see a situation where its a good idea for a pilot to try and glide his obviously disabled plane deep into enemy territory. when there are other safer, more strategically sound options.  

*edit some more words*

If he lands in the water, maybe he can't swim? Maybe the RN can't get to him and he's captured by the germans? Maybe a U-boat shoots his wrecked plane and he dies? Maybe the germans salvage the plane and obtain immense levels of info on the technology?",6ol0kp

Landing on the beach is the best option however once again it's difficult. If the sand is too soft, the plane flips and breaks his neck. (pilots would often not bother putting the gear down if they were going to crash land to avoid this). He needed an area of harder wet sand, and there wasn't any inside the perimeter.

Just for some context: I've flown several Pipers, Mooneys and Cessnas and iirc the propeller stopped when I did engine off landings for practice.

so imagine each Grid has 1 Squadron assigned to it, so 12 Aircraft.

now keep in mind a Spitfire only has enough Fuel for usually 10-20 minutes of engagement time. the Early Spitfires had a Capacity of 60 Gallons of Fuel. now just Traveling around they usually burned around 1 Gallon a minute. in Combat that would increase. so that means most Flights only had enough Fuel for a couple Minutes of Engagement Time. The Spitfire was also never Designed to attack other countries. it was Designed as a Defensive Fighter. 

so to Answer your question, their weren't a lot of Spitfires shown because of operational Time, the Fact most Squads were being Held back in preparation for the coming battles.

dkjhhzf,"Dunkirk was shot in IMAX 65 film format (basically the same as Nolan's other uses of IMAX) and 65mm film (Films such as Lawrence or Arabia were shot on 65mm) meaning they only way to truly watch this would be to see it projected in IMAX 70mm because you can see the higher quality (around the equivalent of 18K according to the infographic) and the full aspect ratio of IMAX film which is absolutely gorgeous.
Nolan uses IMAX and higher film formats because he believes in seeing the best image quality possible. The use of IMAX film brings a showmanship we dont see in film today. However 70mm projection or even a film projection isn't that accessible nowadays, everything is mostly digital which only puts out images around 4K or even 2K (including digital IMAX's).

A regular 70mm print retains all the detail and the deeper blacks from an IMAX 70mm print but is cropped down to the same size as a regular 2D screen so you miss out on half the screen. 

Most Digital IMAX's crop only about a quarter of the image so you miss less of the screen but there is the big drop in detail. 

Definitely do not watch in a regular screen, you will be missing out on half of the image from the top and bottom as opposed to the 70mm IMAX print. That's a lot of visual information you're gonna be missing out on whereas a 70mm print can make up for that because of the increased detail.

I felt like the planes were distinct enough you could tell a german fighter from the british. Though, if you were completely unfamiliar with their planes, I could see how it would be confusing.

It can't get creative with a bunch of colors like La La Land, that would make no sense.  Also, they used U Boats, spitfires, torpedos, bombs, and guns.  What were you expecting, M16s or hand to hand combat knife battles?  The whole idea of making war scary and immersive is to not show the enemy.  If you don't know where a threat is coming from, then it becomes absolutely disturbing.  If I remember correctly, a lot of silent films back then didn't have much dialogue.  No one complains about that, so why even complain about Dunkirk if it's nearly a silent film?  Kurosawa films don't have that much dialogue and mostly is all about visual storytelling.  Dunkirk doesn't need all that much dialogue to be substantial.  Paintings on walls are not audible, but a single image can mean multiple things.  This also applies to movies as well.

I don't think I've ever felt that stressed out during a movie from beginning to end. I was cringing and rustling in my seat for the entirety of the movie. From the second it kicks off you'll be holding your breathe until the very end.

I will say that when I left I was kind of disappointed that I didn't feel much attachment to the characters we're following. However Christopher Nolan isn't one to normally skimp out on his characters so I figured it was intentional. I'd say the characters in the movie are the soldiers as a whole, the planes, war itself, etc. if that makes sense. You're not hoping to see one specific guy make it, but rather everyone make it. After thinking about it more and more I've come to really appreciate it and I'm no longer disappointed with that aspect.

I don't think I have a place for it right now in his filmography. I'm probably gonna see it again in IMAX this time, which I'd recommend if you get the option. Like I said, very different from his usual stuff so it'll take a little bit of time for me to place it. ",6ol0kp

Because it does actually float out to sea. When the men evacuate it it is near enough next to a destroyer.

> The French guy covered his own ass the entire movie and then is the most oblivious to everyone else leaving the boat and ends up getting caught and drowns?

Yes. That's war. You can be doing well and defying the odds one minute and make one mistake or not pay attention for a single second and it gets you killed.

> Tom hardy's plane circles around to shoot down a plane without gas and with the sun still high in the sky. Yet he ends up landing miles down the beach and just hangs out until the Germans capture him? Why didn't he just put the plane down right there? 

Because Tom Hardy's plane is more than just a Spitfire out of fuel- it's a metaphor for both the audience and the men on the beach of defying the odds and being an enduring symbol. Had he just put the plane down the lingering doubt of whether they were safe would return to those men again- It's a morale booster.

* The movie literally tells you, in writing, that the beach story starts one week before.

* Not many RAF fighters were actually over Dunkirk, with most of the combat occurring away from the beaches. Traditionally the RAF did fly in groups of three (with 4 groups flying together). Given that most RAF support was focused away from the beaches, it doesn't really seem all that surprising that only a detachment of three planes features in the film (and historically their formation was correct).

* You misunderstand the night shots. It's not a continuity error, the beach story arc begins one week before the ending, the small boats one day, and the aircraft one hour before the ending.

* While it is true that the Spitfire wouldn't glide that long, historically one did land on the beaches of Dunkirk and another did shoot down a plane while gliding. Nolan just decided to merge the two events into one.",6ol0kp

That is a suicide. I don't think even the stuffy British army would flog a waterlogged corpse on principle. 

I understand subjectivity. No movie will hit all the buttons for everyone. Dunkirk is still fictional. What is shown in the movie is there to express the mood and emotions of British forces in Early WWII and the people on the island of Great Britan. The movie is about emotions and mood stress helplessness loss fear duty etc. Dunkirk is not a factual retelling of the failed invasion. I think you are confusing Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk with Ken Burn's Dunkirk. Not liking the movie is one thing but some of your reasons behind not liking the movie are absurd.",6ol0kp

Otherwise you would know damn well that a bunch of idiots running around like chickens with their heads cut off is something that happens every day under good conditions. With a massive disaster like had preceded the movie FUBAR doesn't begin to describe it and there is a reason they use ""Miracle"" to describe Operation Dynamo. 

Because no seriously that shit is fucking hard to do. 

And sure there probably were reasonably intact units still in good order being overseen by their NCOs. Those would be the dudes you saw queued up nicely on the beach. Of course the NCOs probably aren't going to be *yelling* orders because in the real world like any other job that shit gets old fast, since this isn't fucking bootcamp. Indeed that's a lot of why they do the yelling at bootcamp... so they don't have to on the job. 

As for the men disorganized because whatever unit they were with is dead or scattered all over without any leadership left... well yep they damn well are going to be flopping around like confused fish, because all the actual leadership has their hands kinda full. Someone may eventually get around to them but that ain't no magic. 

Oh and that guy that tried to swim. While the specifics are fictional I can point you at numerous articles attesting to records saying that exact thing happened. 

As for all the historical details, shit man ain't nobody on that beach knew more then fragments of that. At best. What do you think they did, pulled out their phones and hit up wikipedia or google up the news? Hell CHURCHILL probably didn't have all that tied up in a nice package with pretty string at that point. 

You don't want a movie you want a bunch of sterotypes and a history lecture. And not a particularly in depth lecture at that. This movie is more informative since it tells you what it was *really* like without the exercise in mangling and disinformation we call history. Indeed according to [at least one survivor](http://globalnews.ca/news/3617564/calgary-veteran-who-survived-dunkirk-causes-a-stir-at-movie-premiere/) (precious few there are) well...

Not that the soldiers should know, but one person getting off the boat would make literally zero difference. The only way it could is if the water was perfectly steady and the boat was *riiight* on the edge of floating with the slightest trickle rolling in through the lowest hole.

An earlier counterattack (before the events of the film) by the British and French at Arras resulted in very limited success, but likely panicked the Germans into halting to regroup when they reached Dunkirk.

The wisdom of the German halt order at Dunkirk is still debated by historians today.. Either way I guess Nolan probably thought it best not to include the fact that the Germans stopped advancing, as the men on the beaches would be totally unaware of such an order.",6ol0kp

Remember that the Germans advanced extremely quickly. Blitzkrieg managed to break France in a matter of weeks. Troops as a result were very tired and needed food.

Sure they encircled the Allies, but the risk was too big.",6ol0kp
dkjbkfu,No the blunder was the German air force's inability to destroy the British on their own.,6ol0kp
dkisdv8,"Not really. Yes Britain needed an army for defense but the Germans needed an Navy for invasion. They didn't have it. They probably hoped doing more damage to the RN during the evacuation. Plus there was no hope of evacuating the vital equipment, tanks and trucks.

You have to remember France was still in the war and the Germans ever important tanks where in need of repair and the regular maintenance. These tanks would soon be needed wasting them on an enemy already in retreat isn't smart.

Then finally the hole of British surrender. If Britain had it's BEF massacred then Dunkirk would be a huge propaganda piece. Showing 'mercy' might see Britain white peace especially after France.

Then you have the possible breakout. Let's say after heavy ship loses and lackluster amount of men evacuated the BEF, Belgians, and France decided to break out and relink with the main French force encircling a large number of Germans. To stop this you'd need tanks. Committing them elsewhere was risky, keeping them in reserve wasn't. When it was clear no breakout could occur and after much needed logistic and maintenance they advanced.",6ol0kp

So fast, in fact, that the plane was fitted t with automatic dive brakes that would pull the plane out of the dive if the pilot lost consciousness under the excessive G-loading. Spitfire guns would be set to converge at about 250 yards, so the window to make such a shot around be impossibly small and that's if the Stuka dived right past the Spitfire, which it wouldn't.

dkipobx,"I think he landed so far away so he could try to slow the plane down so the landing would have been easier and safer. As for burning the plane I think it was to keep it from falling into German hands, if the Germans have an operational spitfire they could use for infiltration or figuring out the best ways to disable it and pass that information on to other pilots. Another example of destroying a downed aircraft is in Black Hawk Down when they blow up the two crashed choppers.",6ol0kp
dkie18u,"I saw someone else explain it that basically all the men cheering because him shooting down the ME-109 while out of fuel was probably the first sign of victory they'd seen in the war, and if he bailed out and let the plane crash it would ruin the morale that was just built up",6ol0kp
dqvnhn3,Thank you so much!!! You are the greatest!!,6ol0kp
dkkxsu9,"Probably a number of reasons.

The plane was fully functional, so they'd be able to gas it up, fly it, and learn the exact range, top speed, service ceiling, etc. They'd also find out any weaknesses, e.g. Spitfire engines at the time  would [cut out under sustained inverted loading](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Shilling%27s_orifice). The US did that kind of testing during the Cold War with [Soviet planes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/4477th_Test_and_Evaluation_Squadron).

He might also want destroy maps, codes, radio callsigns, and other useful intelligence.

Having an intact British fighter might also be a propaganda coup for the Germans. You can imagine them touring it around as a trophy.",6ol0kp
dm0ntyd,"Yeah I'm just seeing this now but something interesting is that the Japanese had a similar policy to prevent American capture of intact zeroes. Eventually a pilot went down but died, leavin his zero intact. His wingmate was supposed to destroy the plane, but thought the pilot might still be alive and didn't want to kill his friend. The Americans eventually spotted the plane, restored it, and test flew the shit out of it which helped understand it's  capabilities and limitations. The pilots name was Tadayoshi Koga if you're interested ",6ol0kp

dkkykgt,"I have some minor hearing damage and my dad picked imax without telling me. I plugged my ears right as the torpedo hit and didn't take them off for anything but quiet dialog until the credits. 

I was in the fucking lobby of the theater and had to go outside in open air because the bass was still hurting.  

I would have taken my protective ear plugs if I had known.   ",6ol0kp
dklyrgh,70mm was definitely awesome and the sound felt like it had more dynamic range than a digital projection usually has. Maybe the on film sound has more range the same way Vinyl records do.,6ol0kp
dkjx48e,"Probably the theater..... If the theater was in IMAX, in addition to the 70mm, then that was probably the case. My IMAX theater turns up the sound to comical degrees; the second time I saw Star Wars 7, it was at that theater and it was 10 times louder than it was at the (regular-sized) theater I initially saw it at.

Or, it may be that the distributor insisted on it being that loud and the theater just followed through with it. If either way's the case, then it's a tinge disheartening; the studios and venues should try and compete by trying to make the better film/experience, and **NOT** by wasting time with trying to see whose sound-effects-dick is bigger than the others.

we ended up having to leave about 45 minutes on, but that is testament to the quality of film making going on here.

The bass was so loud in my theater that the projector would vibrate and blur the screen when it got really loud",6ol0kp

dkiafss,"The sound mixing is FUCKING terrible in Nolan movies, it's probably why he made this movie, he doesnt give a shit about mixing the dialogue with the sound effects lol",6ol0kp
dki70li,"I thought the same thing back when I saw Interstellar in theater, but it turns out that Nolan does that on purpose. He had this to say on Interstellar's mixing:

>I don’t agree with the idea that you can only achieve clarity through dialogue. Clarity of story, clarity of emotions — I  try to achieve that in a very layered way using all the different things at my disposal — picture and sound.

The idea is that you don't need to hear every syllable to understand what is going on. Not sure I love that approach, but I respect it. He keeps the dialogue grounded in a bit of pseudo-realism, where the characters don't hear 100% of the dialogue either.",6ol0kp
dkiojkx,"I have that problem with every Nolan movie. In Batman, it was Bales voice, then Banes. In Interstellar, I thought Zimmers sound track was louder than the dialogue and I felt so in this. Regardless, this movie was a solid 10/10 for me. I've never seen anything quite like it.",6ol0kp
dkiqahe,Totally agree with you. Good thing the IMAX (digital) i watched had subtitles.,6ol0kp
dkk4xpo,"I had the same issue, which was also a big complaint a lot of people had about Interstellar. ",6ol0kp

dl4o717,"I thought my knowledge of English had completely left my brain while watching it, glad to hear I'm not the only one lol.  
  
I could not understand half of what was said during the entire movie.",6ol0kp
dki6vwi,I think this was intentional. There were parts of Interstellar where the dialogue was difficult to understand as well. ,6ol0kp
dkieblm,"Definitely heard some weird dialogue mixing issues, and not even just in terms of balance with the music, which was likely intentional considering he stated that it was with Interstellar. There were two distinct times when the Commander was speaking on the bridge where his dialogue picks up too much background noise and it's not properly faded in and out. Very jarring to me as a sound designer but others may not have noticed as it may have been subtle enough to the average listener. Considering how mumbled and difficult most of the dialogue was to understand, it made me think that Nolan chose to use ADR in as few scenes as possible for a more natural feel to the film, but to me it really took away from the film experience. At least in Interstellar you can pretty easily follow along with the story so when the music overpowers the dialogue you're not missing out on anything crucial. I was often confused on what exactly was happening because of how the dialogue was edited in Dunkirk. If that was Nolan's intention, kind of an odd creative choice but okay. If it was the dialogue editor or rerecording mixer's fault, that's inexcusable.",6ol0kp

Like when they're in the ship that's being shit at and they're all just yelling, you can't understand most of it, and I thought that was a pivotal part of the scene.

I was pissed becuase I attributed the fact that I couldnt hear what was being said half the time was down to the cinema but I'm relieved to hear its a mixing problem. ",6ol0kp

Literally from the first minute to the last, the sound was on point and kept you into it especially with constant clock ticking in the intense scenes. Also didn't expect the three different timelines, but I liked it especially when you could see previous events from another perspective like when the bomber is seen making a run on the ship from the civilian boats perspective.

70mm IMAX was pure perfection. ",6ol0kp

dltvoir,"I totally agree with the OP above. I think Dunkirk is miles better than Interstellar, but Interstellar hit me emotionally much harder. It's probably because you connect with the characters a lot more in Interstellar. The scene when Mcconaughey sees his children grow up decades in a few minutes had me bawling.

But also, I think both movies are purposefully made to conjure different feelings, and both do a damn good job at it. Interstellar tries to be emotional, it has plenty of slow, mellowed scenes to let you reflect on what is happening.  Dunkirk tries to be intensely stressful because that's what it's like to be there in the battle. Dunkirk is the raw panic and adrenaline rush of just trying to get the hell out of there and survive.",6ol0kp

The best. Most effective horror, relys on letting human psychology scare itself. 

We didnt need to see brutality in this instance. It wasn't that kind of war movie (just like saving private ryan *was* that type of movie)


Dunkirk used subtle sound and purposeful obscurity to allow for stress. True stress.  The type of stress you feel when you're *sure* you saw something out of the corner of your eye, or you're sure something is watching you but you can't see from where.

The score in between the really loud parts made sure to keep you constantly uneasy and alert so that when a big thing happened, it wasn't just a jump scare, but almost a true fight or flight feeling.

Then WW2 saw total war across the whole continent of Europe and stretching into the Pacific theatre. Civilians were now getting a taste of what the men were getting and also more men than ever were subjected to the horrors of battle. An evacuation on the scale of Dunkirk would have been the ultimate act of shame and cowardice to those old attitudes. ",6ol0kp

We don't learn most of the soldiers names until roughly the last 1/3rd of the movie. We hear the names of the civilian's on the boat ( George, Peter, Peter's Dad) and the pilots ( Collins, I didn't remember hearing Hardy's name) but explicitly not the men stuck on the beach, (gibson, guy from the start, Harry styles) 

He tried successfully/unsuccessfully to make it so these could have been any men in their early 20s, and that they felt disposable, with the only thing that they think about is surviving. We see bits of their charaters through there actions/inactions but it's left to the viewer to almost slip themselves in the shoes of these young men. 

Personally it worked really well. I don't think war is mostly about heroism or valour or courage, for every war hero how many hundreds of Tom,Joe, and Jerrys died. That singular drive for survival made it so much more realistic. 

When the british kid is defending the French kid (Gibson) he declines to sacrifice himself for the guys sake and that makes perfect sense. He doesnt think it's right that Gibson should be kicked off but at the same time he doesn't want to sacrifice himself, what most people would feel and do in his situation ",6ol0kp

Another is when the man is crushed by the boat or when you see the older kid telling Murphy that the dead kid is fine. Very simple dialogue, but you can see the kid go from rage and anger to almost sympathy for Murphy's character. Murphy's character will already suffer from shellshock and be a changed man forever, and the kid refrained from getting satisfaction on him at a time when he must have been overcome with emotion because what's the point in making the soldier's life worse?

This in turn would lead to Germany only having to deal with fighting one front in Russia rather than two, AND on top of all of that, the U.S. would have more than likely abstained from war since Nazi Germany would have taken over all of Europe in literally just 2 months time, or they would have joined the war when it was way too late and the battle would have had a far greater death toll then it already has.

Basically, you move the ailerons as if you were to turn one direction, while using the rudder as if you were turning the plane in the other direction, and using the elevator (or horizontal stabilizer) to pitch down.  This creates a lot of drag, greatly increasing the L/D ratio.  By pitching down you maintain enough airspeed, without it you would float up until you stalled. Here's a good [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyzSHSaIlDc) on it.

He could've landed on the beach by the soldiers, but then he would run the risk of killing them while landing.

You're absolutely right that turning at low air speed and low altitude can be very dangerous.  The most common crash in general aviation is from planes stalling when they make the turn from base to final.  They are flying slow and if they overshoot the turn, can end up banking the airplane too much; this leads to stalling the aircraft.

dkz84jb,">and then lying to Cillian Murphy to make him feel better? That last action came out of nowhere and makes no sense. 

Sure it does.   
It makes sense because the son's naive view of War, Courage, and Heroism had changed by the time Cillian Murphy asked after George.

When the son first encounters Murphy, he simply does not understand why he's so terrified.  He simply thinks he's a coward who wants to abandon his duty and country.  While his father tries to explain the effects that war has on a man, it's something needs to be experienced rather than be told about.  

By the end of the movie, he understands better where Murphy is coming from and why he wouldn't want to go back: He's felt the complete powerlessness while listening to the Stukas scream overhead, wondering if he was about to die.  He's felt the heat of bombs exploding, smelt the burning flesh of those who were burned alive.  He's heard the screams of those he could not save.  

> he suddenly decides to mature and do something noble

He didn't ""decide to mature.""  He matured by experiencing what he experienced.  

He had empathy for Murphy, he understood that George's death was an accident, caused by that man's crippling fear.  He didn't hold that against him, because he felt that exact fear in a much smaller dose.

>Sorry, but this piece of ""character development"" felt like cheesy storytelling.

Certainly not impossible, conscription age limit was 41 IIRC (A LOT lied about their age thus slipping in whilst in their mid-late 40s + even a decent amount in their 50s were in WW1 too), so I'd say quite likely actually.

 There was no back story to let us know what let up to this point, no showing the possible danger or even one shot of an enemy imposing and honestly the music score was a bit too overwhelming and drowned out the scenes to make it feel more like a stage performance opera.

Historical films like these, especially WWII, have an extra layer attached to them: remind the viewer of the price they paid and why the price is still important to generations later. Every scene isn't to be taken lightly, Spielberg and Nolan are honoring service members as well entertaining audiences. Getting the balance is crucial and, unlike reading a book, every minute of screen time can't be wasted. They have to quickly but eloquently deliver the message to the audience.

The only way to do this is to have the audience follow a small number of people from start to finish. -- The whole ""going home worried about being spat on in the street and labeled cowards"" after everything they went through to survive.

Dunkirk is famous for the huge amount of vehicles that were left on the beach, there's not a single one in the movie.

dkw5xz2,"Nolan has mentioned that he wanted to make the film from the perspective of the soldier. In the moment, I don't think a soldier could have grasped how many people were saved until someone had told him.

So the idea is that the soldier is getting told what happened to him and can now start processing the magnitude of what just occurred.",6ol0kp

I think the film is wonderfully shot and I understand what Nolan was trying to do. A lot of my complaints are because I'm a history enthusiast and pick out things others might not. I feel like the PG13 rating held out back a bit, too.

I just didn't come away satisfied with any of the plot points or the endings. In trying to avoid making it look like a victory Nolan also made it seem less like a defeat, too. It's very middle of the road on its message.

Personally I'm touchy about glorifying soldier's sacrifices merely because it seems to suggest that their suffering is ""worth it"" - and if its ""worth it"" then maybe men and women in the future will be sold the same lie.

dksape4,"When I was in high school and part of Civil Air Patrol, it was common for us to do flight line security and marshalling for local air shows. The Reading air show, pre-9/11 was always my favorite. 

They would have an event once during the weekend called Dinnertime Charlie where they'd do mock strafing runs with reproduction Japanese Zeroes, BF109s, and replica stuka dive bombers. As they came in to the runway area, an air raid siren would sound and the THOUSANDS of WW2 reenactors there would all start opening fire no matter where they were in the crowd/reenactor area with rifles and mounted machine guns. It was intense as fuck to have planes screaming down out of the air with people firing actual weapons at the sky. The reenactors would often slide a rifle over to someone nearby if they were ""killed"" and you could take part in the action(things you'd never, ever, ever, ever, ever see happen today lol)

Anyway, this is the first time a movie has ever recreated that type of chaos and adrenaline for me. They really got the feel of those planes coming down out of the sky at you correct. I'm obviously not a WW2 vet or anything, and would love to talk to someone who was there at Dunkirk after they saw this movie. ",6ol0kp
dkxw6oz,"I agree. I found myself wishing that the film was braver about being somewhat experimental. It has a really brilliant opening that's confusingly dreamlike and terrifying and apocalyptic. I felt it could easily continue in that vein and conveyed most of the narrative (although it would have been harder to fit in the little boat).

Once the gears of the actual narrative kick in, it loses some of that bold impact. The various plots feel essentially like a series of chamber pieces set against that backdrop. None of them are explored as fully as I'd like, although they do effectively steer the tiller towards a stirring patriotism. 

I don't know that I would have liked to totally remove the dialogue, but you could certainly trim a lot of it and end up with something pretty lean and disturbing.",6ol0kp
dkx7pmo,"They were on the trawler because they were waiting for the tide to come so they could leave in it. Tide wasn't coming for another six hours, though. We know this because the Army and Navy officers discuss the tide in the prior scene on the dock. It started getting shot at for target practice and therefore when the tide did come, the water was filling the boat. The huge argument happened because they needed to lose weight to keep afloat. 

Every soldier on the ship had an English uniform on, but when it came time to lose weight, one of them was accused of being a German spy because he hadn't said anything the entire time. They were going to make him get off because of that. They were going to shoot him if he didn't answer, so he finally admitted he was French so they wouldn't shoot him. 

The soldier we came into the movie with defends the French soldier when they accuse him of killing an English soldier to take the uniform he had on by reminding everyone that there are a lot of dead English soldiers on the beach, he wouldn't have had to kill anyone. And that the French solider had saved two of their lives. It boiled down to ""Survival isn't fair"" and ""It's better him than me"". Before anything else could happen, the ship shifts from taking on water and they start desperately plugging holes instead of fighting until they realize it's no use and abandon ship. ",6ol0kp

Likewise, the film followed one rescue boat with it's own story, but could've easily focused on any of them.

dkidb05,I don't want to sound purely contrarian here but if there was supposedly such little emphasis put on the characters and caring about them then why did the film make such a big deal out of little George? I felt the lack of focus was unfortunately to the films detriment.,6ol0kp

dki9y1v,"I will keep this in mind when I go for a rewatch. Do you think I've been spoiled by war films that contain emotional narratives? I'm sure if it was a deliberate decision, Nolan would want us to care for at least a few characters (thinking about it, I did care about the blonde brother and the great pilot)",6ol0kp
dkpxy0a,"Exactly. The way the French Gibson dude died was just so undramatic and unfortunate. Any other war movie would have had a 15 minute scene revolving around his death where he sacrifices everything to save the other characters, and then the camera will have a close up on his face and he'll say something like ""you guys go without me!"" and the music would swell in the background as the other characters run off looking back and crying. 

I can imagine real war is not like that. People can die from anything and especially in the Dunkirk situation, it's every man for himself and simply move on when someone dies. ",6ol0kp

dkuwbxs,"I would offer up the opinion that they're two different types of terror, though similar. Saving Private Ryan showed the sudden horrors of being thrust into one of the most impossibly uphill battles of WWII, though it was a two-way fight. Even though the soldiers were obliterated left and right, they were fighting back and eventually managed to take the beach.

Dunkirk showcased the helpless kind of terror, one that few of the characters had control over. The ticking score, the constant slow buildup, the faceless and sometimes completely unseen enemy, the overall uselessness of defensive strategies (the AA guns on the ships doing little to nothing; the soldiers being reduced to ducking and praying). 

Rather than being an example of the physical horrors of war, it played more into the psychological horrors of war, borrowing horror movie elements of unseen enemies and slow-building, unnamed dread and tension to keep the characters in a constant state of despair.

Not that I'm arguing either one is ""better"" than the other -- instead that they're offering different views of the same war.",6ol0kp
dkwglhj,I always felt like the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan was *way* too cinematic. The Germans are this big brutes brilliantly using these mythically efficient weapons.

dklpva2,"I don't think the old man did anything to help Hardy, the plane was making an attack run on their ship and he was telling his son to wait until the last minute to evade so the plane wouldn't have time to change its course.",6ol0kp
dklwmej,"So, that was a clever bit of editing on Nolan's part. The plane is shown coming in on an attack run on the civilian boat and the beach at the same time, even though the beach assault takes place after the civilian boat has already successfully dodged the plane. Nolan just cuts the moments together in order to heighten the tension and to let the climax of Hardy/Farrier shooting the plane down over Dunkirk come immediately after the boat scene.",6ol0kp
dkodm1c,This gives my life meaning,6ol0kp
dkvj7oq,Gosh I love this theory ,6ol0kp
dkvq9rm,"I totally agree. The symbolism that even in the direst moments, you maintain your stiff upper lip and take your fate on the chin as this bravery and spirit alone can give hope to others.",6ol0kp
dkw2c8n,Yeah but he could have landed on the beach people do move and there was certainly space.,6ol0kp
dkw27p6,Could have turned around though and landed with the soldiers. Then joined the evac.,6ol0kp
dkw2929,"No they evacuated 100,000 french after the British were gone.",6ol0kp
dkwn1ye,Supposedly Farrier's story is inspired by a real life event. Description [here](http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/dunkirk/) - though I believe the running out of fuel thing is fictional and there to add tension. Deere also has a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Christopher_Deere) with more information about his crash landing at Dunkirk.,6ol0kp
dkzt20k,The sound it was made it for me. So loud.,6ol0kp
dl2uglp,"Oh me as well! I remember the guns on the battleships as they attempted to shoot down the German bombers to be incredibly mind boggling! Could feel my entire soul clench.

dldcj0r,"At my local theater you reserve your seats beforehand, and the time we wanted to make it to didn't have anything free in the center unless you wanted to sit close. Normally I'm a middle-to-back kind of guy but I decided row 4 would be perfect for this film

dkj0qc2,People don't really understand scales well. Having an unattainable grade is silly.,6ol0kp
dkiybra,"The movie is putting you in the shoes of someone at the historical event. The characters themselves are trying to get out of an absolutely shit situation no matter what. Aside from that, the sound design is made to put you into their situations, it's almost deafeningly loud.

Rogue One and Godzilla aren't good movies to compare this to as they aren't based on fact. Aside from the wooden acting, Rogue One and Godzilla as fiction have to create their worlds and develop their characters for us to care about them. The biggest disconnect between the two and movie goers was why should we care about the plot since the characters have no substance. Rogue One was relying on the Star Wars brand, otherwise it's a fairly forgettable movie. Godzilla was really only about fighting monsters, looking any deeper than that and you're gonna have a bad time.

Dunkirk on the other hand, it created the atmosphere of dread and tension. The plot of the movie is some soldiers trying to get off a beach of death, a father and his sons trying to save as many as they can, and a pilot doing his best to stop bombers. It sets these situations up as experiences to a battle that occurred, they're humans in a real shit position and you don't need a personal connection to want them to get out of it.",6ol0kp
dkixded,"No stakes? This is WWII! What little dialogue there is drives home the point that the British Army is stuck, surrounded by the enemy. 

Not being able to name a character isn't necessarily indicative of bad writing, it might just mean their name isn't important. 

We do get some characterization, enough for what's necessary. This is a fast-paced movie, there's not time for someone to monologue about themselves. We know that the civilians have a sense of duty, we know the pilots keep trying to go the extra mile, we know the soldiers are exhausted. That's all we need for the story that's being told. ",6ol0kp
dkkjsgt,"Same, it was loud but didn't find it loud enough for it to be considered excessive. The dialogue was also mostly decipherable for the most part as well to me. ",6ol0kp
dkkqxf2,"I have a BM in music theory - I'm quite aware of Elgar. I'm not talking about the Elgar variation towards the end of the film and during the credits, I'm talking about Han's minimalist drone and low frequency stuff during the battle sequences. It was fine and I understand what he was trying to do, there was just way too much of it for my taste and it overpowered the film in some places for me. ",6ol0kp
dklkbcm,yeah what was the point in that? I feel like removing the enemy like that makes it hard for the viewer to comprehend the danger they are facing. ,6ol0kp
dkv7ixc,You need to watch the movie again. You probably missed a lot not knowing the timelines were different. ,6ol0kp
dkwbep4,"I just saw the movie. First time I'm hearing about ""different timelines"" is reading through this thread, lol. OP must be a tad pretentious if doesn't see how it could have been clearer. I thought the title cards were about as vague as possible. I suppose I could have pieced it together, but I quickly forgot about them anyway as the outrageous volume absorbed most of my attention.",6ol0kp
dki8eod,What really mattered was their plan ,6ol0kp
dkjm697,"yep. I got popcorn and had to stop eating it when the movie started because I lost my appetite. I usually do not watch war movies because they just make me so damn sad, but I knew I needed to see this. It was truly gut wrenching, but I think that was the point. I was curled up with my legs to my chest in my seat. ",6ol0kp
dkx1ost,Never get off the boat.  Absolutely good damn right.,6ol0kp
dsbkn8u,Rude for no reason and doesn't make sense with what I was talking about. You might be one of those people considering how childish that comment is.,6ol0kp
dkly2yd,"  Yeah - I was confused after that first bombing on the beach - bodies flying in the air, only to settle to no blood or dismemberment among those who were killed.  ",6ol0kp
dkm90u7,"I just got back from it and I have to agree with the guy above, even in the few wide shots of the beach, it seemed strangely empty and clean. It never looked like there was more than a few thousand men at most.",6ol0kp
dklq29c,Please don't talk in the cinema. It ruins the experience for the rest of us.,6ol0kp
dklpdpf,Duplicating the extras in the distant shots wouldnt hurt,6ol0kp
dkjwvxf,Thanks :),6ol0kp
dkijcnl,Lol. Graphic designer by trade. Probably watched too many movies.,6ol0kp
dknhum9,"Yea, Tom Hardy's character was, in terms of development, the most inscrutable. Heroic and likeable, which was his function, but harder to know than the other characters. ",6ol0kp
dknjtgi,"I dunno... I spent the last three years living with Brits in London, and I came away with the distinct impression that their culture really *is* quite different in really subtle, understated ways. Maybe that's why the acting and the mood of the movie made more sense to me? The stiff upper lip, the endless, hopeless queues of quiet, desperate men, the shell-shock, the understated despair of it all, and there still being enough inside for them to cheer when a stretcher makes an impossible cross on a broken bridge, when a Spitfire takes down an enemy fighter at the last second -- I thought it was fantastic, romantic, and utterly British (in the way I have come to appreciate them). It really felt like Nolan's love letter to Britain. I was very moved. ",6ol0kp
dknupjz,I think that was a commentary on the war itself. There are no characters. There are no heroes. Everyone's just a number trying to get off that beach.,6ol0kp
dknnl6u,"As others have said, it could be that the Brits tend to be more somber and more cold compared to the more emotional Americans.  Stiff-upper lip was in full effect this film.",6ol0kp
dko0x2s,Character development is boring.  You can create emotion without it.  That's what was done here.,6ol0kp
dknt7ei,"It really is a little bit silly, I think -- I even gave a bunch of examples of character development that took place over the course of the movie elsewhere in this thread, even from the limited dialogue, and one of the answers I got back from someone was that the person took the limited dialogue at face value and so it didn't count as character development. It's as if ""reading between the lines"" is beyond or beneath some of these folks. Dunno, I think it's their loss, really!",6ol0kp
dkit5pm,I wanted those bad! ,6ol0kp
dkio2lk,"This movie was worse than the others for it. Throw in English (and a Dutch) accents and I think a lot of Americans will have problems with this movie. 

Also the soundtrack is too loud in parts so you miss a word or two. I could understand it but I know some others had trouble for some segments of the movie.",6ol0kp
dknz68u,"> Until I read another comment here that said there was a week on the mole, a day at sea and an hour in the air, I thought the timelines were a bit tricky.

that was actually shown at the beginning when they first showed each scene. very easy to miss though.

dkwh4tl,"Yes, that's exactly how I felt. Unengaged. I've a feeling I'll enjoy it a lot more on rewatches though because there's a lot I didn't pick up on. ",6ol0kp
dkiciw6,"Yeah, I saw Hateful Eight at the same theater and auditorium I saw Dunkirk at tonite, and didn't expect trailers, let alone in 70mm. It could be a tease that WB is game to release 70mm prints of films into theaters that can show them. Even in the days of 35mm projection, certain films would have special 70mm engagements, so who knows if WB does the same.",6ol0kp
dkiclw8,"I saw it in a regular but spacious auditorium at a local cinema. If you're familiar with how projected celluloid looks, it's easy to note. Otherwise, I wouldn't know what to tell someone who isn't used to 70 or 35mm how to know if something looks like it's on film or not.  ",6ol0kp
dkipn01,"Haven't found the score online yet so I have been listening to chariots of fire and Elgar's Nimrod to tide me over.

The soundtrack and the dogfights made up for a lot of the movie for me.",6ol0kp
dkiw32v,Entertaining just means it holds your attention and draws you in.  All movies are meant to be entertaining.  ,6ol0kp
dkivq43,"Yeah, they are definitely meant to be entertaining. As Truffaut said, there's no such thing as an anti-war movie cos as soon as you start blowing things up it looks cool. That's not always true of course, and one exception that springs to mind is Come and See. ",6ol0kp
dkl1907,"Yeah you definitely have to combine it with IMAX otherwise the only difference is its a larger screen. 

IMAX made my fucking heart rate skyrocket. I felt so tense the whole movie it was insane. ",6ol0kp
dkk70er,"Oh yeah visuals were amazing as usual, but I just didn't connect with the story in a way I expected. I didn't regret seeing it but the fact I have had no desire to see it again (while seeing Dunkirk twice already) says it really.",6ol0kp

dklcdib,"I was really confused on what the fuck was going on at that sound because I couldn't hear a word they said because the sound balance was so fucked up at 70mm I was at, it was either LOUD As FUCK or really quiet..... ",6ol0kp
dklgm9f,When you have an engine failur and are in a glide you are taught to pick a landing spot and hit. Turning causes you to lose momentum and alitutude. Probably out of fear of hitting people as your trying to stop a plane in sand. ,6ol0kp
dkldmvl,His hatch was jammed.  Well before he hit the water.,6ol0kp
dkldlp8,Question: would it have been possible to glide his plane into the water near the civilian fleet so he had a chance of being picked up? Or would it have been impossible to turn a gliding plane around like that?,6ol0kp

dkn3uh6,Not enough altitude for the parachute to be effective ,6ol0kp
dkmsi2p,"There's the Spitfires, a couple soldiers shooting their rifles at the dive-bombers in the beginning, and then a brief shot of a sailor at an AA gun on the minesweeper IIRC.",6ol0kp
dkmphig,"Agreed. Take Farrier and Collins. I just figured we'd be leaving Collins behind, happy ending. Then you find out he wasn't waving because he was safe, he was stuck and drowning. That wouldn't have been as powerful told back-to-back.",6ol0kp
dkocwrh,Yeah the 'One Week' storyline was most hurt by the format I think. You really had no sense of how much time had passed at any given time.,6ol0kp
dkykoll,Yup!  It was apparently a reference to the film Battle of Britain - an event that happened after Dunkirk.,6ol0kp
dktgujr,Yeah he is listed as the actor for it I believe.,6ol0kp
dkxowy1,"I could understand it all perfectly, but I'm British, so there's that",6ol0kp
dkidto2,"It felt pretty obvious that they were just meant to be nameless soldiers just trying to survive. I was surprised that things were pretty relentless and we never really get any kind of bonding/get to know you scene.

The non-linear storytelling was hard to take, too. It's already a fairly short, intense with a ton of characters- it felt like a bit much trying to follow not just these characters but where we were in the narrative. 

It was a good film and it should get some Oscar notice, but probably not any acting nods.

It was definitely different from most war movies I've seen...I might have to see it again to form a better opinion.",6ol0kp
dkie6rb,"Sure, but I feel like this is the (forgive me) Zac Snyder approach to action. I guess it's just a personal thing, but Homecoming had me far more invested in the action because I cared about Peter. BvS was nothing but WOW factor and I simply didn't give a shit when stuff happened. 

I know it's a bit of an exaggeration, but it's how I felt about Dunkirk. I didn't care if the Soldiers lived or died, I didn't even know their names. They were redshirts, and I genuinely had moments where I thought they'd probably die, but even though I thought they might die, I simply didn't care any more than the dead soldiers in the background behind them. 

I want to feel relief or sadness. I want a movie to make me feel something. This just felt cold and empty to me, which is particularly disappointing because Interstellar's scene when Matt watches his daughter grow up was emotionally fantastic.",6ol0kp
dkjwnf9,"But it didn't showcase the battle? It hovered around the same three main story lines the whole time? Even the air battles were on a ridiculously tiny scale considering just how big of an operation Dunkirk was. 

They don't even show the sheer volume of craft that arrived to save the forces on the beach. They show a tiny handful. 

If you're going to make a movie based around a small amount of people like Dunkirk does, you're gonna have to let the audience get to know the characters a little bit. If you don't want to bother much with characters, shoot it like the Battle of Britain was shot. 

It's flashy and the cinematography is nice. But it's a thriller movie rather than a war movie and will never be held on the same pedestal as other classic WWII flicks.",6ol0kp
dkjzqca,"Dude come on. Bad characters is a very valid criticism of a film and this movie had bad characters. It was trying too hard to make you connect to George and the main teen soldiers and, for me, it totally failed. Another comment here said every ""character"" had an arc and I had to audibly laugh out loud. No character went through any discernible arc, the characters could've been replaced with literal toy soldiers and it wouldn't have made a difference. The cinematography was gorgeous and the action was great but beyond that the movie was super shallow. I even thought the music was a rare miss for Nolan.",6ol0kp
dkjzton,"I didn't once feel like these were real people, they were just vehicles to showcase an event.",6ol0kp
dkk28pj,"I knew people would make this argument, but from a story perspective, I think the film missed the boat (heh) on what could be mined from that story line. There was opportunity for the French guy to live instead of the Englishman (which I think would've been a much more interesting ending, especially once the British citizens saw a Frenchman make it home on their boats--would've loved to see the reaction). There was also opportunity for one of them to save the other. 

But then again, I suppose I'm just frustrated that Nolan didn't make any of the characters feel alive to me, except perhaps for the main character on the ground and the son on Rylance's boat (Peter?). I understand what he was trying to accomplish with his varying viewpoints and working with the time shifts, but I still feel like he should've really fleshed out some of these characters more. To be honest, I would've preferred greater camaraderie between Tommy and the Frenchman throughout the film to see them get through together (and the Frenchman basically saved his ass throughout the whole movie), but alas, it was not to be.",6ol0kp
dkk5noa,"Cillian - didn't like that he killed ol boy. I understand the point of that characters death, it was v important to the whole film, just didn't like that it was him. It felt forced that cillian accidentally did it. They got great stuff out of it too, so it's a minor complaint, but the initial thing was silly. The way they used Cillian killing George was brilliant. But the actual ""cillian kills George"" felt contrived.

Frenchie - him magically surviving. That was it. Everything else was very good.",6ol0kp
dkld1do,"I feel like he wouldn't do Iwo since we had Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima. I don't think he'd try to redo that. Similarly, we already have a well regarded Battle of Britain movie.

Also I don't get one thing  - did he actually manage to bring down that Nazi plane while he was gliding down? You remember? When Commander Bolton closed his eyes preparing to die.",6ol0kp
dklmn4h,"I get it, but [he was shown hitting down a Nazi plane (correct me if I'm wrong) and later flying right above the British troops, why don't just make a few rounds in the air, get down and land safely next to your troops, not the Nazi ones?

dkia9hh,That definitely seems to be what the point of it was. (American here unfamiliar with the history.) There seemed to be a minor point in the film of the French and British being hostile towards each other but it felt like it just fizzled out and went ignored.,6ol0kp
dkntxaj,I seem to recall the card being over the main character's face as he gazes around in wonderment at the scene on the beach. I don't know why but the fact that he just quickly scooted through the French checkpoint and then made it onto the beach with all the wide sweeping camera angles made me think he was in the wrong place. ,6ol0kp
dkjzuoa,"It is not a term I have ever heard before. I read a review before seeing it that said the motive was in three sections and spelled out the Mole section was named for the pier. So I wasn't confused, but until this thread I thought was a name given to that particular pier in Dunkirk for some quirky reason. No idea it was a term for the general structure.",6ol0kp
dkia3va,"A couple of other things that stood out to me regarding [the main character and his buddy being Germans trying to escape. The detail of both of them not talking through the first 45 minutes or so. When the British accent came out I didn't think ""Oh ok he's British."" I thought ""Wow, he's totally playing them."" Then the scene in the boat when the other Brits accuses the buddy of being a German spy and demand he speaks. They both looked really tense and nervous and when the buddy started speaking French I thought that was his way of trying to confuse and manipulate them, only for him to unceremoniously drown minutes later. I feel stupid, but I honestly believed he was a German trying to flee Dunkirk for the entire movie. Remember the scene with the blind man touching his face at the very end? I thought that was supposed to be one last moment of tension where he was worried he'd be able to detect he was German somehow...](#spoiler)",6ol0kp

I admire the movie and like it alot, I just personally value emotional engagement and arcs over what was done with Dunkirk. The hopelessness of war, the anonymity of the soldier, etc. I like that it was brought into the actual structure, but the sacrifice is that none of the characters are likeable or easy to attach to. You just generally fear for the ""british soldiers"" fate and not for a specific characters fate.

I need to watch it again though to confidently make a final judgement. I think the movie is mostly a success.",6ol0kp

dknuqn1,"[This was actually a very realistic and well choreographed moment of the film.  With no fuel, the pilot has very few options for maintaining a safe rate of descent for a landing.  It's clear as he's flying over the beach on the first pass that there's a good stretch of land ahead of him to make a safe landing with a good approach.  The choice to turn to take out the bomber used up all of his available altitude and airspeed (his only resources) and left him pointing the opposite direction.  At this point, his only option is to land facing that direction.  Any time you turn a plane without power you must lose a significant amount of altitude to keep your airspeed up.  Making another turn would have put him into the ground or the ocean.  While he didn't have sufficient altitude to make another turn, he was also too high and too close to the brits to land and come to a full stop there.  On top of that, he had to stay in the air long enough to hand-crank the landing gear down.  His only option was to maintain a glide slope away from the brits and land on the edge of the safe zone.  With no fuel and therefore no power, you are at the mercy of gravity and the speed required to maintain lift.](#spoiler)",6ol0kp

It made it feel real to me. The emotion came from seeing how terrible it was, how east it was to die - picked off by a strafing fighter on the beach or drowning in the hold of a ship or the cockpit of a downed plane. Modern war involved death on such a scale it becomes a statistic, whole lifetimes end in an instant.

When Rylance's character piloted the boat off the port saying something like 'they will get the boat and its captain', I thought the marines wanted only the boats and no civilians should be on them (We saw some marines got on some boats).

Is it something like they finally realized marines were not enough so they let civilians help? 

",6ol0kp

Personally, I find it more striking when I'm shown the more inhumane, faceless aspect of war. I find it more haunting to consider a row of soldier getting mowed down by artillery or machine gun fire. There's no meaning to that death. No story, no struggle. You step out onto the battlefield, and you die. Like so many before you, to be entirely forgotten, with only the vaguest pretence that you're making a difference. 

Like, shit, I don't want to die on beach surrounded by the enemy making desperate attempts to escape. But at the least the characters in Dunkirk had a small degree of agency. Serving as cannon fodder to be picked off by the enemy, where nothing I do will matter or affect my or anyones chances of survival... there's no romanticism to be found. ",6ol0kp

And for that, it's something we've really never seen on film before.

Maybe Nolan's idea was that in such a scenario, relationships with anyone can be short lived and uninvested except for the common goal each person had to survive and succeed.

dkvnmhz,"2 reasons.

1. He cannot bail, as he only had a parachute and was already below the minimum altitude for the chute. Parachutes require a certain amount of height to open and slow the user down. (this is the reason modern ejection seats must be able to carry the user to a certain height, even when used on ground level)

2. He cannot turn, as turning will cause him to lose airspeed, which means risking a stall. Stalling without power at low altitude equals crash. I had to look into this one [a bit more](https://books.google.ca/books?id=_4nGtx-_jHUC&pg=PA152&lpg=PA152&dq=turning+during+emergency+glide&source=bl&ots=JalO-iH-ya&sig=x0cLA-fiUx7FttcbjMxtdmdQ_Lc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwim2MjDga7VAhWov1QKHbHODP0Q6AEILDAB#v=onepage&q=turning%20during%20emergency%20glide&f=false) and it appears that both rate of decent and the speed required to avoid stalling increase during a gliding turn. 

Only options left are ditching and gliding to land, at which point the less deadly option of gliding is preferable.

Not knocking Nolan or those movies; I'm a fan of all of his work. The point I was trying to make is that Dunkirk is a far more conventional film, and perhaps Nolan's best to date. He doesn't ""need"" superheroes or gimmicks to make great films. We hadn't necessarily seen that side of him before Dunkirk.",6ol0kp

I quite enjoyed the non-linear element of the film, made it all that more chaotic and frantic. But this sort of defense of lack of character development is indefensible. Just because Godzilla does a horrible job at it doesn't mean it's something to just be eschewed. You can have both the unique factor and the interesting characters. It's been done before. 

I will say that Nolan certainly went into it with full awareness of what he was doing, and in that way, he succeeded. But I think it won't work for a lot of people, and I think their gripes are more than reasonable.

I could hang up some of the shots on my wall. The audio-visual experience was one that very few could replicate.

I think at the end of the day, this film will be split by the viewers film philosophy, in that people who prefer fleshed out narratives and character studies might not get as much out of it, and those who are more focused on the visual story telling (me) will be much more receptive of it.

George's story has a more emotional impact because you actually pick up on his final speech about why he boarded (was a disappoint to his dad and wasn't doing well in school so he wanted to prove his worth)

Cilian Murphy noticing at the very end that George died.

Alex dunking himself in the water after the Commander tells them to come up because he needs to pretend that he was one of the survivors of the sunken ship.

The soldier burying the British dude is immediately picked up as being a Frenchman because you notice the French flag insignia on a coat lying to his right. Alex see's this and consciously ignores it, then drinks from his cantina of water. He knows they're all just trying to survive.

Tom Hardy on his way back home and then sees the sunken vessel that Harry was on and the bomber responsible. Decides to turn around risking his life in the process after he had told the other pilot that he would head back when he went under 15 gallons. 

Tom Hardy waving back at his friend because he thinks he was waving at him first, but in actuality he was trying to push open the cockpit.

Actually understanding the encounter in the beginning with the French soldiers (i.e wtf they said)

Catching that the Lt. tells the Commander that the French have held up against the raid on the northern line (afterwards is when we see the civilian ships show up, so had the French failed everyone on that beach would have died that moment).

Just a bunch of narrative details.  ",6ol0kp
dkigqdc,"First, I thought the non-linearity had no reason being as complicated as it was, but on second viewing, it all made sense.

And second, I thought the characters were weak, but on second viewing, I noticed incredibly nuanced character moments and interactions that I had completely missed on my first viewing because I had been unwittingly busy trying to piece together the non-linear narrative.

[Things like Gibson tying his shoe when we first meet him, or being the last one to try to plug the holes in the ship, or Collins ignoring Farrier's final radio communications, or Peter lashing out at Shivering Soldier for hurting George but then not saying anything after he dies.](#spoiler)

These moments may not sound like much on paper, but in execution, they feel so subtle that you really buy into the fact that these are real people and not movie characters.

There are a ton others that I can't think of right now. I urge you to go for a second viewing; I had no plans on one either, because why rewatch a film you didn't love? But I was dragged to it, and now it's become one of the year's best for me.",6ol0kp

We already see mid-evil battles get cushioned like this, which is why I love the Game of Thrones battle scenes. It makes me feel like I'm really there because of how gruesome and real it is.

The planes look beautiful and behave as realistically from a physics perspective as any I've seen in a movie (to the point that I'm now googling whether they used real Spitfires for some significant percentage of the aerial shots). The cockpit shots are tight and claustrophobic, the struggles of getting lead on the target are perfectly well represented and a nice detail.

But then, here's a question for you: A Spitfire is head-on with a bomber that's en route to bomb a ship. The ship is ahead of the bomber, and behind the Spitfire. Previous frames suggest that the bomber is all but on top of the ship (but somehow isn't -  see: 80s action movie trope comment above). As far as we can tell, these are the only two planes in the area. The Spitfire passes underneath the bomber and performs what maneuver to get it back in its sights with haste?

Did you guess immelman? Half cuban eight?

Ooooo sorry, the answer we were looking for was ""leisurely left-hand turn.""

It focused on how different military personnel dealt with being in WWII.

Say a boat arrives but they're all hiding in buildings - by the time they get out and down to the beach (and you might imagine it'd be an unorganised rush as they're desperate) the Germans could have bombed the boat from the air and bombed them as well anyway. 

At least if they're already on the beach there is a chance some can get away on a boat more quickly. Plus I think the issue was also that the Germans were closing in from behind (from the town) so not much safer really.

dkiav6f,"It was such a throw-away moment that I'm not surprised you missed it. I almost did. Harry Styles was bitter because the blind old man wouldn't look at him, and was saying that they'd be hated. It's why they ignored the man running beside the train at first. It was only then that Nolan did the switch-a-roo to show ""oh no, it's all positive, the man beside the train is cheering them/etc"", when they could have made the tone less convoluted by simply having a 'victory' sequence to make the audience feel grateful they were alive (yes they could have reminders that it was technically a retreat, but I didn't need that switch-a-roo reveal). 

Fair enough about Tom Hardy. I agree it was badass. 

The 10s navy thing bothered me because it felt like it weakened the bravery of the real civilians, AND it weakened the moment of relief when they got to the beach. The story of Dunkirk is about the everyday men volunteering their lives to save their boys, not because the government forced them too. 

Attempted Analogy: If United 93 (the movie about the 9/11 plane being brought down by the brave civilians) had included a 10s scene showing a bunch of navy seals sneak onto the plane before take off, but never mentioned again.  

You'd be annoyed because; 

1) It makes their actions less heroic, 

2) It's not fair to the people who really died on that day, 

3) If the moment the plane about to hit the ground a voiceover said ""There were no navy seals onboard United 93"" you'd have a mental pause and think ""Ummm... what happened to those Navy Seals?"" instead of being emotionally caught up in the deaths of the people on board. That 10s would change your perception of the whole film. 

Finally, the historical aspect: The burning spitfire had no engine, just a pipe/crankshaft (I know this wouldn't bother most, but it annoyed me). 

The 2nd spitfire sank flat, instead of nose first (which wouldn't bother people except for ww2 enthusiasts, but to be fair, this movie was meant to be for them too). (I'm trying to find youtube footage to back up this claim, but failing, so I can't say it with the certainty I would have liked). 

From a historical sense, the film pretended that it got 200k people off the beach in an afternoon, with the help of 1.5 spitfires. The real thing took far longer, more people, and more bravery than was displayed. Nolan really wanted us to know there were 400,000 men on the beach, so it's not our fault for seeing a couple of ships and a single afternoon and thinking ""That's not enough"". 

My United 93 analogy might be trash, but hopefully it gets my point across. I liked what Nolan did with the minimal enemy/blood/dialogue, but it appeared to me that he wanted to to be carried by his visuals, sound design and awe, and I don't think it was quite enough. ",6ol0kp
dki9113,"I'm sort of glad I'm not the only person who felt this way. The movie has been getting incredible reviews (It's great that people enjoyed it). The movie itself just made me feel quite empty.

and for me, it was. ",6ol0kp
dki9969,"Exactly. 

Nolan wanted the sequences to make us feel a certain way. He achieved that on the first two boats. By the third one, I was sitting there thinking ""What more does he want from me?"". ",6ol0kp

I'm fairly certain I got the general gist, and after discussing it on here I don't think I missed anything the first time through. I certainly havent had any ""Oh shit it all makes sense now"" revelations.

At that point, the movie misses the most horrifying aspect of war, which is the importance of each life lost, that these were all real people with their own families, thoughts, stories, etc. who were snuffed out. The movie essentially reduces the men to voiceless, nameless figures, a step away from statistics. You flinch when a bomb hits the beach, but it's entirely in reaction to the film's technical elements (i.e. sound design) rather than anything else.

Like repeat viewings always show something new about the narrative, story, theme, character that you missed, in short, layers. While, Dunkirk is a technical marvel, I was incredibly let down by the lack of layers and symbolism. Film should not just be technically evocative but it should try to say something important and timeless(you will find many best picture oscar winners were chosen because of this very characteristic, not just because it was just technically innovative). I can appreciate what I would call minimalist films which I would include Gravity as being. Even with Gravity though, there was a theme, layers, symbolism(I even strongly disapproved of the main anti-science theme but I still appreciated that the filmmaker took the care and time to craft a story around technical marvels).

The action is thrilling, the dogfighting scenes were great, the visuals were awesome, the sound is awesome, the soundtrack is more like sound design in how it worked and it was amazing.

I was incredibly disappointed in the Sea narrative because it came at an extremely different angle than the other two. If you want to show the brutal nature of war, then do so. I am not sure why Nolan stuck this awkward coming-of-age story with the blonde kid in the middle of this movie. To me, the development felt a little half-baked. Nolan specifically said he wanted to leave character development out of the film, yet a third of the movie revolved around 2 men and 2 kids in a boat.

This is *not* the case for Saving Private Ryan. They all have personalities and stories, and that is what makes us empathize with them so much so what happens in the end is devastating.

dkom7di,"Just because it's perceived as, ""realistic"" doesn't mean it translates to entertaining. Watching a sea of nameless faces get mowed down for an hour and a half isn't all that exciting for me. Especially, when I have no emotional investment or character to follow or care about. I go to movies to go on an adventure and escape reality a bit, not to sit in on a war for an hour. That's why I have the caveat of if you're a history buff or had family or were involved with the incident maybe it's a bit more compelling. I work at a cinema in New Zealand and that's like 80% of the audience that goes are elderly people who have a connection to WWII. (There's a lot of Brits here)

But for me, originally American, I have no association to Dunkirk. We didn't even learn about it in school or anything. I had to wiki it beforehand to be a bit more aware before I watched it. So maybe that allowed me to detach from it a bit and just view as a movie and nothing more. ",6ol0kp

If I had a criticism then it's that it's sort of jarring, but it's forgivable, as like you say, these couldn't have been done linearly.

Nolan deliberately goes out of his way to avoid war cliches which is nice, but he goes too far in that the movie fails to capture what a triumph Dunkirk was in terms of how it raised morale and a sense of patriotism yet with an underlying understanding that its a bittersweet victory given the British never imagined it would become so desperate and that the war has only begun. He certainly tries to salvage it in the end but none of the storylines show the emotion I'm describing adequately in my opinion.

Your example of Nolan being constrained by in-universe timeframes only works with the pilot storyline.

Peter realizes this and comes to understand that some things are better left unsaid, as is the case when he makes the decision not to tell the soldier of George's true condition. It comes from a place of compassion and empathy. The shivering soldier has suffered enough emotional trauma already, having to deal with the survivors guilt of being only one to make it out alive off a sunken transport ship full of soldiers. Why let him further carry the guilt of being responsible for some innocent boy's death?",6ol0kp
dkobutu,">You don't really get to know him, but then you don't really get to know any character. I didn't get the sense Nolan was asking the audience to tear up, the point is more the circumstance and the reaction of other characters.

I feel like the first part is exactly why the George storyline felt so off-key for the movie. The most distinct (and IMO most effective) emotional chord of the movie was that these were just young men fighting for survival while the grander scheme of the war was somewhat irrelevant. None of the other characters were given a particular emotional weight in their deaths or struggles or what have you, and it was just the merciless march of war that killed them (not some fall down the stairs).

I think the framing with the newspaper bit (literally the one bit of exposition George gave) and how it ends with the hero bit and blah blah was (as I said earlier, unlike the way every other character was treated) meant to give that emotional resonance of a more conventional war movie (and every other part of this movie was going against that kind of convention). 

> (1) shoehorning the little feel-good arc of the newspaper story after George says that's he wanted. Just cut out the part where George directly says he wants to be in the paper and it's fine -- kid goes to war, needlessly dies in noncombat, society's impulse is to sort of rejigger the situation to make it sound like heroism, putting a noble spin on it.

Yeah this was silly, if only because George literally didn't do anything and all of the sudden he's a hero in the paper. 

>I don't quite understand the narrative purpose of having the British soldier (Cillian Murphy) being at fault for injuring George. He feels bad, asks if he's okay, turns passive for the rest of his screentime, and is lied to about George's condition. It seems like more interesting could have been done with Murphy's character. Just as simple as he's hostile about not going back to Britain, but then we see him getting invested in pulling people from the water. Have George be injured in another way. Or even hit by a bullet from that fighter.

I agree. I think the weakest bits of the movie was where it kind of was neither here-nor-there. It was never going to be able to give the characterization/exposition necessary for certain elements to pay off, so it would've been better if it scrapped them altogether. And that is a far more succinct way of saying everything I just did. ",6ol0kp

dkk1ghf,I understand the approach that Nolan took in terms of character development but I also think that approach was fundamentally flawed. I appreciate Nolan's eye for detail but I also think character development is a crucial part of a good movie. If we don't care about the characters it's hard to care about the event and vice-versa. Even if the filmmakers intended for the characters to be so poorly developed that doesn't really make up for the issue itself and it certainly doesn't make the movie more entertaining.,6ol0kp

dkjxwqf,"I agree 100%. I was quite disappointed with this movie. I love war movies; I love history; and I love Nolan.

I can understand the over-hype... what I can't understand is the over-hyped ratings.

The editing of the story arcs are well-done but completely unnecessary and distracting for the viewer. Basically, it takes away from the experience and adds nothing other than an avant-garde flavor. I bet most people couldn't figure out what was going on in the first half of the film.

Is there a climax in this movie? Hard to tell. It's just a constant dreariness (I get it, the point is to show the ugliness of the situation)... but there is very little character depth or story arc. The one character you care about is The Mole but you lose sight of him toward the end.

Hans' music? As good as Hans can be expected, but you won't be buying this score for anything. There are no melodies worth remembering... it's just a constant tension throughout the film. In fact, there are very few seconds where music isn't playing. It's unremarkable though other than to set the mood. Compare that to the genius of Interstellar or Inception's scores.",6ol0kp

The whole point of this film was to showcase the emotions through the actions these soldiers had given the time of struggle they were under. Their focus was to escape, and nolan grasps that feeling of emotion on each of the main actors in the film - it gave us a sense of how life was like during these times.",6ol0kp

And by relating to those people, you feel more for their struggle and better comprehend the stakes.

The film's best asset was the clocks, which was done very well.

As for showing ""tension, terror, trauma"" loss of ego and identity, futility to go on against war and death"" it was not done well, or at least not in a way I personally enjoyed. While these points were there, they were not done in as well of a fashion that I would expect from Nolan.

I believe I may have been *too* critical of the movie. Movies based on historical events, especially war, are my favorite type, so naturally I have become quite picky of what I consider *good*. This movie was not bad, by all means, but it wasn't *amazing*, at least not as people are making out to be. 

I might have enjoyed it more if I was in a different mood, if it was a different day, in a different theater, with a different setting. I don't know. But looking objectively at the movie alone, I cannot say that it is worthy of the acclaim it is receiving. Again, the movie is good, but not that good.

At the end of the day, this is just my opinion. It's apparent that we do not agree on this, I don't expect that everyone will, hell I don't expect most people will. I was just trying to give my take on it.

I like how not liking the film automatically equals to wanting ""superhero or scifi visual masturbation"". I didn't think the story of a million people dying needed to have a fucking irritating soundtrack or the disorienting as fuck three-storylines thing. I loved many other war movies: full metal jacket, black hawk down, saving private ryan were all great to me. You know why? Characters to relate to. This movie intentionally didn't have that. If the story could have done away with any of those, maybe it would have been easier to appreciate your precious ""time when millions of people died horribly"" in movie form.

This also ruined the feeling of suspense the film was trying to convey. Are soldiers and officers really this stupid? Did some trenches or holes. Try to hide when there is no boats around at least. Or maybe shot back? At some point there was a shot of all the rifles laying around. Why the hell would you do that when you are surrounded by Germans? Everybody can't be out of ammo.

And don't make me get started on the whole ""target practise"" scenes. Or how Hardy managed to glide and glide and glide and glide. Or why his wingman closed the window when he was landing in water. Wouldn't you want that open to get out quickly and don't drown?

As to the overall theme of the ending,some context is in order: the reason 300,000 men were needing evacuation to start with is because they left Britain to back up the French military against Hitler -and got owned. I'm sure most of them thought they'd be returning to a cold reception back home.

I think that's a really generous reading of it. The kid died from an accidental shove. I don't think you can even call that a casualty of war. ""People often die for stupid reasons"" would be a weird message to take away from a movie.

> The reason he was in the paper was because when he was dying, he told the blonde kid he wanted to make the paper to make his dad proud.

Yeah, I get that's why the friend asked the paper to put his story in (personally thought the kid forcing that backstory while he was dying was especially ham-fisted for a movie that otherwise lets the scenes speak for themselves). I just don't understand why the paper would agree to put it in. There's a huge war story and this kid had if we're being honest a really dumb and unimpactful death.

Again, this is obviously a very small part of the movie, but just think it was a very fixable writing misstep. Why not have the kid's death actually tie into the war in a more direct way? He obviously showed himself to be selfless in volunteering and he foreshadowed that he could be useful, but then he died in a manner completely independent of his usefulness and selflessness.",6ol0kp

Single engine fighters however could not push the blades to ""full feather"" for minimum drag - this capability was only bestowed on multi-engined bombers to help them return with asymmetric thrust.

dkl18va,"Vastly different amounts of energy involved. A Cessna 172 prop is 80 inches in diameter and weighs 67 pounds, and is designed to spin efficiently over a very narrow speed range. By contrast, a single Spitfire propeller *blade* weighs as much as an entire 172 prop assembly, is linked to the engine by a reduction gear that gives it huge torque and is designed to produce maximum power over an extremely wide range of speeds (up to over 350mph). The Spitfire's prop is also between 125 and 130 inches in diameter.",6ol0kp

dl1afjl,"Regarding your second point; [he was far too low to bail out, and as shown earlier in the film ditching in the ocean is rather dangerous! A safe touchdown with landing gear is always the preferred option, even if that means almost certain capture. Better than being dead!

dl0398m,"[So I had the exact same question. After a brief google search, it seems that a lot of pilots would rather not shoot out because of fear of being shot down and that being a war prisoner, as sucky that is was, wasn't all that bad.

dku5mke,"I thought it was an action movie because the movie was 2 hours of almost non-stop action with barely any dialogue or worthwhile character development in between. I understand what you mean in number 2, I just think it made the movie boring, I literally did not care at all what was going to happen to any of the characters. A film about young men being trapped on an island awaiting their death should elicit some emotions. There are plently of movies that convey the horrors of war better than Dunkirk, but with characters who are developed so you care whether or not they die. I did not care at all about the fate of any character in Dunkirk.",6ol0kp

I just wanted more of everything. What was there was great, but it was just small. ",6ol0kp
dkwj29y,"I was lacking the same amount of context in other war films. War is war. What context was really needed for this? Hundreds of thousands of troops were stranded on a beach with no immediate escape, being pressured from land air and sea, slowly losing ground in all areas.

I don't know what it's like to be a member of a tank division, but I felt something when watching fury. I don't know what it is like to be a medic, but I felt something watching hacksaw ridge.

If there was supposed to be some historical information to make the movie work, it should have been in the movie. I didn't even know hacksaw ridge was based on a true event until the movie ended!!!!! 

I just didn't feel any urgency, I didn't feel like anyone was that worried, I didn't see any real pressure being put on the beach, I didn't see the same fear, panic, stress, anger, exhaustion in anyone in this movie. 

I mean the dam captain saw one of his destroyers blow up in front of em and all he did was push it away and go well lets get you boys on another boat! THERE WAS NO OTHER BOAT!!!! You just had a ton of people die!!! No one was rushing to help the injured in the water!! 

I felt the isolation, I think it could have been portrayed better, but at least I felt that. But dam, nothing else was felt.

He near killed my guy ...and that's not on lol!",6ol0kp
dkkv21p,He was dead at that point. Which made relieving the soldiers conscience even more impactful.,6ol0kp
dkktxy1,"1. OK yes that makes sense, if he was over the water that would've worked, but once he saved the men on the beach in his final run, a water crash was out of the question, and the plane would've landed in German territory, which was unacceptable. So to save those guys, he had to land, burn the plane and get captured as a best case scenario.

2. Understood that while Alex led the mob, the other guys went along with his agenda. Also seemed like getting one person off the boat wasn't going to do a whole lot, given the amount of holes it had, so maybe the scene exists to show that mob mentality? I feel like cutting the entire grounded ship saga would make the movie even stronger.",6ol0kp
dkl9w7p,Yeah but a lot of movies have characters that would normally speak a different language speak English with an accent instead. And I couldn't really tell what his accent was because of the mask he was wearing and how loud everything else was.,6ol0kp

Usually, survival films have story to add for flair. But, Nolan does something different which unexplainably adds more to the movie as a whole. This movie just stands out so well from that perspective as well as a cinematographic standpoint. And I can already tell, this movie will age well too.",6ol0kp

dkldrd4,"I understand your points, but my impression was Dunkirk wasn't about characters. It was several small but powerful stories, different vignettes wound together into one overall experience showing how the actions of some would impact the lives of others.

dklhpn7,"Dunkirk was explicitly about Deliverance, about going ""home,"" as we see in the opening type and then is illustrated for two hours. It is about the small choices that we make and how they matter, it is about how there are no heroes, only people surviving and some of them trying to help each other. The only ""hero"" in the film was given the title in the newspaper for simply choosing to step on a boat. Dunkirk is about the biggest subject any filmmaker can choose to tackle but you have to learn to understand what that even is.

dkj9pwi,"Thanks for not just flaming me with a glib response that isn't worth responding too! 

I thought the photography was beautiful and novel, especially in the air like that. My issue with the dogfights were the lack of establishing shots. Too often we would be looking directly at just one fighter without a clear indication of where the others were. It would be especially jarring either coming out of a Tom Hardy closeup or out of a scene from either the land or sea plots. I know he would lose track of planes, but I didn't think that we, as an audience, should as well. I think that it became much clearer as the other brits are shot down because we can focus on Tom Hardy's spitfire and a bunch of german planes. But I am not a student of aviation so the silhouettes of the planes from both sides looked the same. My mother was completely confused actually because she thought the civilian boat was rescuing a German fighter.

I agree that the stories lined up, but I found myself questioning whether this could have been accomplished with a standard chronology and what it REALLY added. For me, i thought it detracted more than it added, but I did enjoy how the moments lined up.

Additionally, I felt no connection to any of the characters. I see how many will argue that this was Nolan's intention but I felt like it took away from the movie.

The destruction of the ships happend in such a way where you barely got to see any 'terror' it was mostly suspense of escaping the ship of the 'main' characters to the tune of 100db of disgusting riser screeches that dragged on for 5 minutes. Far too long. I don't think it succeeded at all. They really needed to build the characters up so we could feel anything for them... and i don't think i cared for any single character at all. there was no Germans or engagements for defense other than the opening shot.

Batman had decent pairing of film and soundtrack. Inception was so-so but the soundtrack was outstanding on its own. Interstellar has both although on its own it is not as good as Inception.

This one has...nothing?

And what's absolutely stunning is that it failed to do what could be done in such situations i.e. use the constant soundtrack to relieve pressure at crucial moments. When it does by the end with the plane it just goes over your head because it is done so poorly.

Either way, Leonard is the bad guy in this movie, and accidentally killing his wife with insulin was the least of his crimes (if he actually did it). He's obsessed with getting revenge for an event he doesn't truly understand. Not just that, he doesn't even remember the event, so he has to get tattoos and write notes and take photos to remind himself to get revenge, even though when he wakes up every day, it's not what he automatically wants - he could live a satisfied existence and maybe even be happy again if he didn't keep pulling himself back into his ridiculous game. When Teddy tells him he already got the guy responsible, he refuses to believe it, because the chase is all he has now, and he'll murder Teddy without proof or real information on anything, just his own twisted word to himself.

dkv6i43,"An aerial maneuver with two pilots. One the bait and one the tail. The bait has an enemy lock on behind them, starting to make sweeping back and forth maneuvers. The tail comes from higher above opposite the enemy and bait. The bait begins wide sweeping back and forth evasive maneuvers. The enemy makes course corrections appropriately, trying to shoot down the plane in front of him, unaware of the tails presence much higher and parallel to him. The dynamics of those wide turns back and forth allow the tail to predict where the enemy will be in a pattern. He dives in the opposite pattern to the bait and times his bursts of fire to hit right after the bait's path intersects his own. The enemy essentially flies into a hail of bullets he never saw coming. The maneuver was first put into practice during the battle of midway.

If you follow the pattern of the bait, enemy, and tail, the pattern makes a endless crisscross. Or thatch. The pilot who first created the attack pattern was named John Thach. [More can be found about the maneuver here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thach_Weave)",6ol0kp

More like highly improbable. For one, Hardy's character turned his plane around. Something hard to do when gliding but possible, so we know his character lined up the shot. Secondly, the burst is a solid 2 seconds or so. He fires straight into the path of the oncoming plane, he can and does hit it.

If you're shooting into the space where they will be and not the space where they are, you're prolly going to hit. That's like fighter pilot 101. It's not impossible just highly unlikely and definitely a movie plot event.",6ol0kp

dkih3y4,"It's based off the real pilot, now as an WW2 aircraft fanatic I can say that based off the movie he could have theoretically landed both in the water and on the sand. However my guess is that the movie followed the actions of the pilot during Dunkirk true to its word but made up a couple of stuff for entertainment purposes.

For example, there was no way a Supermarine Spitfire (with the Merlin Engine) could maintain a glide for that long (and at that speed) and shoot down a diving aircraft without wasting too much speed and altitude. (Also remember the recoil from the guns slow down the aircraft as they fire)

In reality it all probably happened extremely quickly that the pilot didn't have time to land on the beach or in the water near their troops and instead had to find a better landing spot that was close enough to glide too.

Also parachutes back then weren't reliable and had a very high ceiling that was needed before jumping.",6ol0kp
dkigvq2,Probably too risky for the men on the ground for him to land near them.,6ol0kp

dklu67t,"I think there was no way for him to get back to the brits safely for him or them. Turning around and landing his AC near the brits risks the soldiers cause you need a long ways to land a plane. And they had them surrounded tightly. Despite them showing Collins put down his spit fire in the water they would have had instructions to do whatever possible to avoid it because the chances of nose catching and tumbling, or wing catching and totally breaking your plane (and you) into a million pieces is so high that you don't put it down there if you can help it. Also with the amount of boats and men in the water he would risk running into some of them

Especially trying to move in a level/downward angle already.

The captain of the civilian boat, knowing the pilot would have to commit to a basically straight line, waiting until the point of no return to have his son alter their course (relative to the fighter's path).

There were no additional squadrons, not even any hurricanes, and their small rifle caliber guns that the RAF had to deal with in the early stages of the war were shooting down BF-109s and Heinkels like they were made of paper. The RAF in ww2 was incredible because they made a miracle working with a pile of shit, not because spitfires and hurricanes were a technological marvel that annihilated the Luftwaffe in every sortie.

There was also the ""everyone is having the worst day of their lives"" syndrome. The canopy of the pilot who went to ditch in the ocean just happens to get stuck. Ditching a plane was so common, they didn't have to create an additional problem to make Dunkirk seem even more tragic. 

Given, the attention to detail they did show was on point. The effects and style matched up with reality as much as one could hope for, so I can't complain too much. ",6ol0kp

I totally agree with you and the person that commented back to you. The movie holds its own but the dialogue was just poorly mixed.

There's probably a lot going through his head ""right now"" but the Frenchman betrayal is definitely part of it. I'd argue a big part of it -- isn't his line on the train something like ""that bloke wouldn't even look us in the eye, eh?"" like he's desperately seeking some kind of approval from the main character kid (who's already fast asleep). And I stress ""desperately"" because it was written all over his face. (Which, going back to OP, I guess is a credit to Harry's acting. So i gotta give him that).

Still, it wasn't just that he accused the French guy of being a spy -- he was forcing the Frenchman off the boat at gunpoint in order to save himself. (Frenchman had 2 choices: be murdered by his allies in the boat or exit the boat and be killed by the enemy.) Basically instead of making the sacrifice himself, he was going to sacrifice someone else -- someone who was directly responsible for saving his life earlier in the film. Pretty shitty. As I've said in other posts though, I've never been to war so it's tough to really judge. He did try to save/warn the Frenchman in the end.

This movie tried a different approach to make you connect with the war: it's an immersive experience and made you out to be a participant in it. Let's be honest: the backstories of Leckie and Basilone are quite fascinating, but in war in real time- you don't give a shit about Leckie's attempts to woo a woman back home. You just care about survival.

In war in real life, there's no narrator in the background. There's no romantic notion of the war. There's just moment-to-moment survival, and it many ways it feels very empty and you are very alone.",6ol0kp

One thing I appreciated is that it *didn't* go down this familiar war movie path. It didn't feel the need to stake out a (sort of obvious) position on the realities of war, and it didn't fetishize exceptional acts of heroism (although sacrifice was definitely a theme).

Instead, it took the hellishness of war and the individual cost as a given and asked ""ok, what's the human response in this situation, and how can we put the audience inside of that.""

also the British air forces werent the only ones that were over reaching by being there in terms of fuel and stuff, but also the germans, they were able to only hit and run on the beaches due to the same circumstances, the nearest air base was kinda far from that beach, and not only did they have to bombard the rescue ships, but also fight a cornered enemy, which as you know, its a dangerous thing in war. 

the movie didnt set up antagonists because the antagonist was time, they were fighting the clock in terms of rescue, the germans were the enemy but you dont see the troops themselves in the movie, because you are kinda required to know already the danger they posed, at the beginning of the movie you only had some pamphlets shown with a drawing, reminding the audience that the Germans had them cornered on that beach from every direction. 

and i dont think they made the German Pilots as incompetent in the movie, after all, the first 2 british pilots were out of combat pretty fast, they sinked some rescue ships and bombard part of the beaches, and they didnt want to include crazy air stunts because they were using real equipment AFAIK.

dks5veu,"If Nolan only wants audience to feel only general empathy towards his characters, like you describe, then it is not necessary for us to follow them for 2 hours. We can feel empathy for relatively small reasons, and even for minor characters. How many times you've seen a movie and thought ""I hope he survives, he seems kinda nice"", even though the role was small. maybe even unimportant? I know I have many times, usually in war movies where the group is so big I cannot be emotionally attached to them all. Usually this feeling is not based on anything particular, maybe on small details and moments. So following characters throughout the movie for empathy is not necessary. Talented filmmaker can evoke empathy in a matter of seconds, if he so wishes, and Nolan actually does this in the very first scene of the movie. 

This general empathy works in the beginning of the movie. When the characters face their first struggles and face death for the first time, [like when the whole unit is shot down, and only one survives](#spoiler), we don't know them and yet still wish they wouldn't die. But it doesn't work at the end anymore, because all I had for them was still this same general empathy, although I had followed these characters for 2 hours. My emotional attachment was still *""well, dying sucks""*, and at that point of the movie, after Nolan had used cinematic language to tell us they are important, and made scenes where the audience is forced to follow them closely, it was getting tiring. I had less empathy for them in the end, because filmmaker had failed to deepen my connection to the characters from its early stages, despite making choices that rely on audience caring about these particular characters. 

I was forced to ask myself upon a yet another drowning scene: ""why should I care if he dies or not? There are literally thousands of others like him on the beach"", and filmmaker didn't provide satisfying answer to this. Yet he kept focusing on these few characters in their blight. ",6ol0kp

Other than that, yes the continuity errors in whether were so extreme to the point that I got confused whether we were taken back to a different scene (being aware of the non-linear style). 

I feel like more of the main cast should have died as well and of course, the attacks that we saw were brutal, but sometimes they were weak and I felt like there should have been more. Maybe this has to do with the PG13 rating, I'm not entirely sure. The opening scene was absolutely fucking phenomenal though, felt like there should have been more of that, maybe from the point of view of one of the French men somehow.

No one is saying this is a bad movie. They're saying ""this would have made it better."" As great as Nolan is, he's got weaknesses like anyone and character development is one of them.

Furthermore, whether something is historical or fictional has incredibly little to do with emotional investment. I'd be willing to bet that of the people alive today, the death of Simba's father in The Lion King evoked a stronger emotional response than the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Of course Lincoln's death was infinitely more pertinent to real life, but *that doesn't matter in art.* What matters is how invested we are in the characters involved in a story, because at the end of the day the point of art is to invoke an emotional response.",6ol0kp

In this movie there was nothing to show the stakes, just some text at the start and some clumsy Brannagh dialogue.

It certainly didn't come from the characters who had not characteristics at all. Hardy was Stoic, Rylance was brave and driven.

The stakes came from knowing the history, and that was it. I, and everyone else knew that if Dunkirk fell it was bad for the allies, good for the germans. To rely on just that is poor, imo.

As for the boot-stealing Frenchman, I saw him from the same perspective: just genuinely trying to survive moment by moment.](#spoiler)

[**As for the blind man at the end:** I thought that scene was meant to illustrate just how differently Tommy and Harry Styles (or 'Alex' per IMDB) see the world. To elaborate: Tommy clearly understood that the blind man was, obviously, blind. (I took things one step further and assumed he was blinded in WWI). Harry/Alex, meanwhile, took the blind man's lack of ""eye contact"" as an insult. Which, to me, just showed how thin-skinned he is.

I'm paraphrasing of course).  That little tiny piece of dialogue made it so much more impactful when he decided to bring the boat over towards the downed-plane, even though Peter didn't see a parachute and it was doubtful the pilot had survived.  It was a metaphor for him trying to ""save"" his son, a fighter pilot who was killed in battle.

It was cut from the very start to build suspense like it was leading up to some grand *thing*, but it eventually dissipated, and then the ticking got louder on the train only for it to stop suddenly, but for all the other timelines as well, and then the movie just ended.

And if the clock *was* ticking it certainly didnt feel like it. Other than the occasional bomber attack, not a single enemy soldier was shown the whole movie. There was no sense of the island being cornered in.

These guys largely were just uniforms on a beach, all with one very simple goal: reaching home. The fact that home is the goal made me imagine what home meant to them, and although not explicit, still made me see them as a group of individuals rather than a mass. Maybe that's a stretch, maybe not. 
The fact that death could come for anyone of them at any time, from the air, land, or sea, gave that anxious panicky feeling which I think worked well. Some nice juxtaposition of feeling claustrophobic on such a massive, open landscape too. 
I agree the technical side of things were leant on a little bit to boost certain aspects, but they were enjoyable nonetheless. The big sound design was impressive, and the score nicely fitted the scenes. 
I also agree that the story was one dimensional, but I'd argue that the one dimension was propped up by the ones travelling toward the danger as opposed to away from it, namely the aircraft scenes (I'll admit I go weak at the knees for a Spitfire). 
I feel more could have been made of the small boats crossing the channel - that's where the character detail could have run riot. These civilians, trying their best to play at being the Navy, their sacrifices and fears. On a side note, I'm not sure what the timeline jumps were trying to achieve...

dkidd9z,"I cannot say, for sure, if he could've made it from one side of the English Channel to the other.

The thinnest part of the English Channel is the Straight of Dover sitting a little less than 21 miles, but Dunkirk is east of that and the most direct line to England is DEFINITELy longer.

But we cannot be sure just WHERE exactly Tom Hardy ran outta gas when he was downing that German bomber...movie did not confirm for 100% fact their exact location at the time. 

So we cannot be sure that Tom Hardy's character did not simply just realize that once he ran outta gas that his best chance of survival was to head for French soil instead of British. 

Even assuming that a pilot 'safely lands' in the water there's NO guarantee that he'll be rescued or can even swim a (relatively) short distance. Being a lifelong swimmer I can fully attest that unless you are VERY competent and physically qualified to swim long distances (ESPECIALLY when it's open water like that...ask Michael Phelps if you think that there isn't a UNIVERSE of difference between open-water swimming and pool swimmng BTW) then your chances of actually making it back to the shoreline for even a 'short' distance like 5 miles are slim-to-none. 

Not the least of which may simply be the fact that the swimmer may very well swim in the WRONG direction...if it gets dark enough and there's no visible light or other visual aids then you will TRULY know how DARK it can get out in the open ocean...it's a VERY terrifying spot to be.

Not to mention that cold water like that will sap your strength like no other, and 'combat clothes' REALLY drag on you a LOT and make your swimming speed FAR less than it could be.

There are plenty of ways he could've dealt with this, but once again...we cannot be sure that Tom Hardy did not WILLINGLY choose to land on French soil rather than British b/c he may have had no viable alternative. 

Also, I am not very well versed with the exact 'specs and physics' of the Spitfire. But if I were to guess EVEN IF Tom Hardy had ran completely outta gas directly over Dunkirk if he had did a GIANTIC climb to the service ceiling that his aircraft can handle and then just simply 'drifted' I'm willing to bet that he could've made it pretty damn close to England, if not straight up land there. 

Can't say for sure though since I'm not familiar with WWII-era aircraft very well. 

In any case, he DEFINITELY made a sacrifice when he choose to land as far away from the retreating forces as possible knowing full well that the Germans will divert their forces away from the retreating Brits in order to capture a Royal Air Force pilot who is more valuable than just your run-of-the-mill infantryman.

dkifw14,"Right so the whole point of the movie was that most of the surrounding area was occupied by the Germans. Tom Hardy's character basically defended the beach until he had no more fuel and after that altitude left (no more turns), that was the part where he shot down the last plane. Still he didn't give up and pumped his landing gear until the last second before landing.

Fair enough. I love history and historical dramas but I consider this more of an artistic achievement than an attempt at pure history. It's more visceral. It's about that moment in history and has the look, but it's about something raw.

The score is so integral because it's so non traditional. It's not John Williams style (not that there's anything wrong with that style of scoring...I listen to the Rocky soundtrack by Bill Conti all the time). It's designed to increase tension for the most part and that's it.

dkk5xfs,But it wouldn't be right to be happy about two characters making it when we see hundreds of others die horrific deaths. That's why IMO he made the characters cold and distant. This is war and in real war there's no time for sharing your life story when you're just trying to survive.,6ol0kp

Heck!  There were some superman-like instances that had to be left out by Gibson because he thought it would be too unrealistic for audiences.  One instance was that a Japanese sniper had Doss in his sights three times...and his gun jammed each time it faced Doss.  The sniper survived the war and thought that somebody divine was protecting the medic.

As for the music, it's supposed to keep the urgency and intensity of the situation going. There are a few respites in the music which accompany the scenes where they're given a break, but other than that it's a literal fight for survival the whole time. Something is always happening. I think it made perfect sense for the music to be the way it was, which made the part when it finished such a relief because you realize that they actually made it back to England - they survived.

Oh and the only escape route being the ocean. The scariest thing lurking under the water no longer being sharks or whatever - but fucking *german submarines*! 

So keep one thing in mind - these events actually did happen.

This movie isn't Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers, which both sought to elevate particular individuals to mythical levels of heroism. The characters in this movie are ancillary, meant to serve as representations of groups of people rather than actual people. Just like George was the embodiment of the civilians who sacrificed themselves for the war, and Cillian Murphy embodied the once great men who were broken by the horrors they experienced.

By giving characters an arc and ""development"", Nolan would've flown directly in the face of the entire concept of the film, which was the camraderie and joint effort put in by every Englishman during the war.

It's kind of assumed that the Germans didn't believe England could really evacuate as many as they did. Even England thought 30,000 would be a success...I don't know how much of this is just Christopher Nolan's MO and how much of this is being American (I'm American--I don't know where you're from, obviously) but the British are quite familiar with this story. They largely don't need explanation for it, because they've grown up with ""the Dunkirk spirit"" and the history and all that.

The constant spectacle of bombs? the constant spectacle of repetitive pitiful dog fights? the constant need to point out ""it's just over there, and point to the ocean 8 times? no cgi? that's a reason for something to be considered good? not really... because there were plenty of old war movies that never utilized cgi but excelled in other areas that this movie clearly completely missed the ball on. This was clearly just going old school for the sake of going old school but missing the beef entirely. The three timelines were closer to one obnoxiously slow one. No typical war movie tropes? oh, you mean like the ones were people were afraid for their life, people missed their buddies and felt sad? they actually felt something other than bleakness? you dont need unrealistic characters to make you like them... you just need genuine ones with some kind of way to feel for them. I wouldnt even really consider any of them 'characters' at all... more like mice in a field of mouse traps. character development through actions? I can kind of agree with you... but honestly... there so few 'actions' in this movie that i can't really call that 'development'. The soundtrack was so overcooked, cacophonous, loud, repetitive, and just plain annoying it was disgusting....

Guys aren't gonna run through enemy lines with a BAR killing a ton of enemies, this isn't call of duty. Lots of dramatization in that movie.  
There's some nit picks with this movie but it's extremely accurate in how it portrays what actually happened.",6ol0kp

These men, who had fought so long and hard for their country, had to wait three excruciating days while watching the enemy escape right from under their noses.",6ol0kp

For the aerial scenes, he was able to only get 3 spitfires and he actually attached IMAX cameras on the plane and get the shots. For the shots with pilots, he used aircraft that has two cockpit, one for actor and one for pilot. A lot of people may find the lack of CGI fails to create a scale of epicness for the evacuation, but I personally appreciate his dedication for practical effects. This one of the reasons why his movies always look ""real"" and tend to age very well. ",6ol0kp

dkrkq0u,"The movie was designed to make you feel immersed in the event, as if you were there witnessing/experiencing it for yourself. It was not intended to tell the story from a god-like History Channel documentary perspective, so it makes sense you that wouldn't see the entire efforts of the RAF during the battle, only a small episode.

 I agree that parts of the movie weren't perfect (i.e. the sense of scale was lacking with regards to the number of civilian ships that came to the rescue and the number of actual soldiers waiting on the beach), but to call this movie a fucking joke is hilarious. ",6ol0kp

dkqn51o,"Well they did show. Considering the actors can't literally be in two places at once I would hope that most people realise that they're being shown at different times. I doubt it hurt the storytelling either. Kept things flowing and suspenseful throughout. We could have a linear plot, but that would be boring in this case because it'd involve 75% of the film watching soldiers do absolutely nothing on the beach for a week. Now you could argue that it should have showed the brass making decisions or whatever, but that's just shitty film-making. In that case you'd have a pretty useless subplot for the first 40 minutes that gets abandoned in the end where the focus is on the salvation of the soldiers.

Just because you prefer a linear sequence of events doesn't mean that Nolan's decision to cover multiple arcs together was a bad one.",6ol0kp
dkq7bro,Yes because that would be boring af.  Also it's not a Nolan movie if you're not confused for most of it.,6ol0kp
dkjq1q4,"There is no relief of pressure. That's the point. It's a constant fight for survival, against the clock. I get that you could think it becomes boring, but I think it did it's job well of keeping tension. ",6ol0kp
dkjqa8y,"What annoyed me the most was that this movie had no heart. Hacksaw Ridge is a perfect example of victory in a hopeless situation but the difference that Nolan doesn't seem to have a grasp on is that in Hacksaw Ridge it is satisfying because you care about the characters. If anything  by the end of Dunkirk I disliked most of the characters and didn't really learn anything about them. Nolan seems to really struggle with crafting characters that you actually care about. I appreciate the effort with shooting on film and 70mm IMAX, the sound design from the gunshots, to the planes, and bombings were terrifying and authentic but as much as Nolan wants to keep the theatre experience alive, which is commendable (though sometimes snobbish), all of that stuff goes out the window when the story just doesn't work.",6ol0kp
dkkenjk,"I can't attest to the accuracy of the film because honestly I don't know much of the history of the event. 

Also people voicing their concerns of the movie and ""being low on upvotes"" is not proof that PR is downvoting you and others as some great PR scheme to trick people into thinking it's a perfect movie. 

People like it because it's different from what you usually get from major summer blockbusters. It's unique in editing, sound mixing/editing and visually it was beautiful. Now I'm sure you can point out other lower budget films that have non-sequential editing or films that build suspense that you think are better and that's fine. But it further proved that Christopher Nolan with a very mainstream audience can (and will) take risks without fear of isolating his audience. He could have essentially remade his other successful movies into a WWII film and still made millions but he chose not to and I appreciate it. 

I agree it's not for everyone and it isn't the best movie to ever come out or even the best of the last few years. But I loved it and I'm not a Nolan fanboy that will defend his every move. If you didn't like it, that's fine but don't take it as a personal attack that others did. And if it took certain liberties to build tension, or further a narrative that should be expected. It's a movie based on historical events, not a documentary of those events. 

Also for some reason I get the feeling that you're an 18 year old history buff who thinks reading accounts of battle is the same as being there. That's just as naive as thinking you can experience war through a movie or video game to be honest. And if that's not the case and you actually have been to war or been personally affected by it, I apologize but that's the impression I'm getting from your comments that seem to be trying a little too hard to come across as edgy.

The altitude issue was also one reason why he didn't eject from the plane as well (the main reason, though, was because he didn't want to risk the far-more-advanced technology contained in the Spitfire getting into enemy hands; he went down with the plane in order to make sure it was destroyed completely).",6ol0kp

dkkbhqn,"The World Wars were extremely tragic and formative moments in our world's modern history, so of course there is a fascination with those events for Hollywood. I agree with your point about rehashing the same story over and over in endless war films, but Dunkirk truly is such a gripping and exhilarating experience that it does offer something new to the genre.

As for the ""*patriarchal testosterone driven drama*"", there is nothing patriarchal about retelling a simultaneously tragic and triumphant moment in human history in a respectful and honest way. ""Unfortunately""? , women weren't allowed to enlist as soldiers, so of course a film about World War II will mainly focus on male perspectives and stories. However, Dunkirk still endeavours to include women in empowering roles when it can. When the British civilians come to save 338,000 soldiers, plenty of women can be seen guiding boats and preparing for the evacuation.

Bring that sort of gender representative discourse (which undeniably is a huge issue in pop culture right now) to where it's needed, not to an honest and truthful retelling of one of the greatest war stories in history.

What I'm trying to say, is that even without the Indian subtitles, people would still understand what's going on through other things, like cinematography, editing, etc.

*Dunkirk* would be considered a silent film for me. The dialogue in that film was completely unnecessary and very minimal to begin with. They could have cut out the minimal dialogue that existed and made it a literal silent film. 

The reason I say *modern silent film* is because today, every movie has dialogue and sound. We don't really have true silent films, aside from some indie films that not everyone is going to hear about. It's a technological change. So having movies like *Lion*, *Dunkirk*, possibly even *Whiplash*, where cinematography is the main priority and dialogue is one of the last priorities, make them the closest things we have to silent films.

But that plane is travelling at 156 metres per second away from guns that have an effective range of 250 metres. It's difficult to get across just how impossible it is to hit a target moving at over double your airspeed to somebody who doesn't have combat flight simulator experience at the very least, but Hardy's Spitfire simply did not have enough energy to get guns on target and fire in the kind of time frame reality presents us with.

The aerial action sequences, specifically shooting down the He-111, felt like quite a long time to Hardy's character, but when viewed from the men on the ship or the downed British pilot it was over in a matter of seconds.

So in that manner, Hardy's character managed a burst on the Stuka and it would've been over in a couple of seconds, but the way Nolan expressed the feeling of adrenalin turning seconds into minutes and minutes into hours it was portrayed longer than that.

Make sure your landing circuit is correct. Water landings are much more dangerous, I think he chose the beach landing cause it's overall much safer, as well as the fact that it was at that position it very very busy in the water and crowded. What if he went back tried to land in the crowded Dunkirk water and accidentally sunk a couple boats while doing it. I think he made a decision to sacrifice himself for the good of the rest of the evacuees. At to that he was a Brit, and an officer, he would be treated better than most in a POW camp with a company who did sign the Geneva convention. We could argue for days about what Germans did to prisoners but at that point it wouldn't have been known.

Anyways, when any film is shipped it comes with instructions on how the projectionist and house should deal with the film. Making sure Color is correct. Making sure it’s displayed on the correct format, maybe with a minimum luminance projector.  With those instructions some movies will require the technician to measure the sound level from the center of the room with a test tone. So maybe Nolan required that his movie needs to be at a certain decibel rating to allow the movie to even be shown. ",6ol0kp

dkixvzs,"I don't know, personally I don't feel that needing to rewatch something in order to better connect to the story or make better sense of it because you couldn't do so the first time isn’t exactly a testament to a director’s skills as a storyteller.

Denis Villeneuve's Arrival, for example, is another movie told in non-linear fashion that you're trying to make sense of for most of the 2 hour runtime of the movie. But that confusion from trying to make sense of these random scenes of the protagonist's daughter never distracts you from creating an emotional connection to the characters on the screen. It's a very complex and deep movie that I didn't need to rewatch to feel connected to or to understand better. But at the same time, further rewatches still add a lot of brilliance to the movie that you didn't catch the first time around. In my opinion, the most masterful storytellers are the ones who can craft movies in the same way that Arrival was crafted, where even though the story is incredibly complex, it all still clicks toward the end on the first viewing and you feel very emotionally connected to the characters and their situations throughout.

Every situation, whether it be a boat being torpedoed, a pilot almost drowning, another boat sinking scene (I began to lose count), a kid being killed by a shellshocked soldier, or soldiers burning alive in an oil fire, my only reaction was ""Well, that's unfortunate.""

I liked the sound editing, and there were a couple of visually stunning scenes, but that only accounted for about 5% of the movie. The opening Stuka bombing and Farrier's beach landing were particularly memorable. Everything in between is a blue and white blur of monotony.

Instead of rooting and wanting their escape, I was left with not caring and almost felt like they were cowards because I had no empathy toward their plight because of the lack of emotional connection ",6ol0kp

Those guys were separated from their own units, they didn't know anyone and were too exhausted or caught up in the chaos to take a moment. Having them chat about their girls back home or whatever would've been total bullshit, just exposing the strings of the story. I much preferred it this way. 

Their actions spoke pretty loudly about them. One thing I liked was they were all intelligent, like figuring out it was target practice, grabbing the stretcher, sneaking onto the boat, not going down below. It was like the opposite of a horror movie in that all of their survival instincts were top notch. ",6ol0kp

Plus it's not a movie about fighting, these guys are trying to escape safely. They even comment that their guns are completely useless in the movie. 

I'm surprised to see people saying it didn't connect with them, it was such an incredibly visceral and anxious experience for me, easily one of the most impactful and stressful movie-watching experiences I've ever had in theaters.

I wish they'd done without them. However the jungle scenes where the characters are psychology beaten down, the visual harassment and fleshed out enemy and the trauma they inflict was so much better done. In Dunkirk the characters don't seem real or at least theri world feels isolated from mine and a slightly different reality. In band of brothers you didn't always follow one character, you'd constantly be introduced to new locations, new people, lose them and move on without details or back stories but they seemed like humans. In Dunkirk they seemed, like I said earlier, stage actors. It was almost like I was looking into a snow globe and watching this film take place from reality outside so it seemed ""off"". I really think had Nolan not been so artsy with his directions or toned it down a bit I would have enjoyed it better. I mean I literally walked out of this movie hating the main character!

It was reported that he got away from his plane as fast as he could and walked something like a hundred miles through enemy territory ending up in Brussels where he went to the US embassy, which refused to take him in as they were not yet involved in the war. With nowhere to go he surrendered and became a prisoner of war.""

The only way he could have effectively added it would have been either a first act pre the evacuation(which would have changed the film entirely) or flashbacks (which while possible still think it gets in the way of the point of the film). 

I think this is the perfect companion film with The Thin Red Line. TTRL shows the beauty of war and the emotions of the conflict while avoiding cliches. Dunkirk shows the brutality and relentless of it. As Nolan said in a recent interview, giving the main character a girl friend back home to make it back to doesn't add to this goal.

Like, a few shots of the guys on the beach during sunset or clearly dawn, or rolling out of blanket etc would show us approx. how much time is passing for them.

While there were some absolutely gorgeous images and the sound mixing was tremendous, my heart isn't going to remember the desperation or the savagery or the kindness of any of these men.

Ever since it all went digital and corporate realised they could save a couple of pennies (the head projectionist was rumoured to be the highest paid member of staff in the building, even over the GM) they've gone down to a skeleton staff and stuff like this happens all the time but they never apologise. We watched about 2/3 of Rogue One on opening night last year at 50% brightness because the 'automatic' system didn't retract the 3D filter.... I'm starting to feel less confident in seeing my biggest most anticipated movies at this location because they seem to keep messing it up..... ",6ol0kp
dkl8y91,"Sheesh, little cinemaphiles already, huh! And yeah, my kids aren't sheltered, and I'll probably take them to see it -- if only because I want an excuse to go see it again!",6ol0kp
dklab3t,"Yeah that's what I thought, the scene where they go to the boat and try to wait for the tide to come in seems like a more possible stretch being as that's where the allies had fallen and the German's started shooting at the boat ",6ol0kp
dklanwi,Yeah the evacuation was constant over the week. He just focused on those certain characters getting evacuated. There was a lot more also going on while what we saw was happening.,6ol0kp
dklasz8,"Yeah you are right when I done my essay on it, sources said that the majority of the civilians done multiple runs across multiple days and that's what allowed the people at home to prepare trains and stuff to rehabiliate the population returning. 

And yeah i think it fast-forwards to the end because it's supposed to be across a week :) ",6ol0kp
dkmmv9l,"Really?

I think Lucius Fox's disgust is pretty clear and yes, he does use the machine for the night (and by that at least partly justifies its existence) but threatens his resignation if it isn't destroyed immediatly afterwards. If this was meant ot be an analogy for the PATRIOT Act, then its about how it might have had a time and place but its prologned existence is inexcuseable.

And regarding fighting crimes mercilessly - note that Batman might be a vigilianty (I mean if you make a Batman movie there is no way around *that*) but in the example of that Chinese mobster businessmen just hands him (like Scarecrow) to the Gotham Police. 

And yes, he tortures the Joker and to a lesser extend that Mobster...although at least in the former case that whole scene is meant to show how futile his violent efforts are in getting the information he needs, in the end the joker gives him the wrong information (switched adresses), hard to see an argument for torture there. 

Not negotiating with terrorists is not necessarily conservative, its a matter of principle - a principle which has rarely been enforced (by the US goverment) when it was inopportune, its mostly a PR thing. And not negotiating with terrorists is generally a movie problem - negotiation with the baddies looks bad on film, explaining why torture is so prominent in stuff like 24 where in RL an effecitve approach would be negotiation. Batman not negotiating with them is in my eyes excuseable given how far removed their motivations are from reality, in the end he leaves everybody but Ra's al Ghul in police custody (Bane gets killed by Catwoman, Thalia dies in the shittiest accident ever).

...and doing the unpopular thing because its right is hardly conservative, its pretty universal and the context wasn't justifying torture or anything so I don't see parallels to hawks in Bush's administration justyfing torture with it being the right even if unpopular thing.",6ol0kp
dko170h,"Not sure.  They definitely had parachutes in WWII, but I don't know what the survivability of bailing out vs ditching the aircraft in the ocean was.  As for Hardy's plane, though, before the turn to take out the bomber he had enough altitude to make a safe landing in the area he wanted to, but after the turn he was most likely way too low to be able to bail and have his parachute open.  Just the time it takes to climb out would probably put his plane into the beach, much less the time and altitude it takes for your parachute to deploy and slow you down.",6ol0kp
dko3aib,I don't think he was high enough. Too low to the ground and a parachute either won't open properly or there won't be enough time to slow the jumper down enough to land safely.,6ol0kp

dkod1cb,It also depended on who captured the pow. Luftwaffe were known for treating pilots extremely well,6ol0kp

dkxwo9b,"It seemed fairly obvious that it's just a little stylistic trick to wrongfoot you at the start. A lot of that opening sequence relies on being a little bit uncanny and dreamlike. I thought it was pretty effective. Between that and the closeness of the shot as he walks through the corridor it put me in mind of birth, oddly enough.

Presumably they were on the floor to try and take cover from the plane that has just dropped the leaflets.",6ol0kp

You say you feel like nothing happened and that's exactly correct; but in reality you FELT incorrectly. What you felt and what actually happened are two different things. Nolan had great emotional connection but you're not suppose to get to know them through just words. It's through action that you learn who these people are. Who they truly are. I've watched so few movies to get an actual emotional reaction from me and this was one of the most powerful of all",6ol0kp

dkmbyal,"He glided over a lot of beach before finally setting it down. Why not whip it around once more to land towards his guys and have a chance? Then to burn the plane and wait to be captured? It was a cool shot, but it did not seem like a very rational decision.",6ol0kp
dkmaryw,"Obviously not right in close to the beach but considering how far he glided along the beach, he could have glided out to sea and been picked up by one of the dozens of ships that where there at the time.

dkyrukf,"Also he need to handcrank the landing gear down, which takes time, *and* further decreases maneuverability, so once he began that, he basically needed to commit to that line for a fairly long distance, or else risk a belly landing.",6ol0kp
dkx2x3g,He seemed to fly a long time in one direction though. Long enough that he either got miles away from the evacuation or they were done by the time he was down. He had already turned around to hit the Stuka. As long as he didn't manoeuvre too hard he could have pulled it round to land close enough to the evacuation without stalling. ,6ol0kp
dkx2usp,An engine doesn't have to be running to be able to manoeuvre an aircraft. Only to climb or maintain altitude. I believe you even see him flying one way and then turning around to face the other way in the film. ,6ol0kp
dkiktut,I think he meant post the beach. Like once they kill the Germans on top of the hill they are already laughing/joking etc. minor critique but I highly doubt people who survived that beach were making jokes so soon after.,6ol0kp

It was such a massive distraction from the reality of the film. He stuck out like a sore thumb. The other lead had an emotionless face and the voice matched. The youngest son on the boat. I felt sorry for him. It looked like he'd wandered into the boat and looked confused by everything. Even the other actors. To be honest. This may have been better as silent movie with hans zimmers vangelis"" score. I thought rylance, Murphy and Branagh were slightly wasted. But they delivered. I just wish they'd got better actors for the lead soldiers. I said in other posts, I hoped that whoever did the voice over for the trailer wasn't in the film. Unfortunately, he was.

Like, as much as I enjoyed films like Saving Private Ryan, Hacksaw Ridge and Fury - they're very focused on particular squads, their background - often their faith and whatnot. Dunkirk is the polar opposite.

It doesn't pump you with dead bodies, firefights and set-pieces. There is no cue as to when a battle starts.

It's random, sudden, unexpected. I can't think of a film that has done this before. This film had me on edge the entire time and it was fantastic.

It felt like a constant panic attack haha. I have never experienced a movie like it.

dkrvyux,"I appreciate this viewpoint, and I do think this was the intention. However, personally I like some sort of view of the threat. We got the bombers/fighters in the air, the torpedo in the water, but not really anything on land besides bullet holes. Used sparingly and shot correctly I think showing troops slowly moving forward could have a great effect. 

Maybe I wasn't immersed enough my first viewing, but I couldn't really grasp the threat that was so large it had these hundreds of thousands of men standing on the beach so desperate to get away. I had the concept of that fear in my mind, but I've never been in a situation remotely as desperate as this. So my imagination of that force fell short I think. 

Anyway, thank you for taking the time to write out your opinion on the topic! I like to hear what others have to think! ",6ol0kp

dkvny4p,"What I was getting at, but didn't adequately say, was, we see the beautiful shot of the spitfire and then it cuts to black, then cuts to the soldier for probably no more than 2 seconds, then cuts to black again before the credits roll. It was sloppy and jarring, and idk if it was just because I saw it in 70mm and it had something to do with the projection reel or what, but the final 5 odd seconds just didn't click with me. For the record, I don't see anything wrong with cutting back to the soldier, but I believe the burning spitfire works much better as a final punctuation to the film. ",6ol0kp

I came away from this movie not even knowing anyone's name and really not caring about any of them. I'm sorry but there was something wholly lacking in the characters in this film. The guy that was shell shocked at least had some kind of defining feature and I liked the relationship between the old man and his son in the boat but it just wasn't enough to make up for our main protagonist having nothing interesting about him and barely even speaking lines.

I'm going to have 1 more attempt at my shitty analogy. 

This is the real movie **[United 93](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQdjDtlK3uQ)**. It's about a real event, and real people, in recent history. I'm going to argue about Dunkirk, using an analogy derived from 'my' alternative version of United 93. I'm hoping that my changes to United 93 will explain my frustration with Dunkirk (2017). I've picked the movie ""United 93"" because I'm hoping that everyone reading this will know the true story of the 9/11 plane that was brought down by the brave men and women who refused to let the terrorists use the plane to kill more people. If you don't know the true story of United 93, I believe the ACTUAL movie was an accurate version of the event, so compare the REAL movie's events to MY movie's events.


**United 93** is about civilian's doing a brave thing to save others. (The Movie and the real thing) 
The **Story of Dunkirk** is about civilians doing a brave thing to save others.

In the opening minutes of the movie, the Navy is seen commandeering the little ships for the Dunkirk rescue. The scene is short (10s) and shows the Old Mate captain running away from them to go to Dunkirk. 

In my analogy, United 93 would have a scene that shows a bunch of highly trained Navy SEALS hiding on the plane. 
(Both show the trained military setting up to do a military thing) 

In Dunkirk (2017) The sailboat is one little ship that sails out ""We have a job to do."" There are no signs of other ships with them, and it's presented as the captain's personal and solitary choice. 

In my United 93 analogy, this would be like one passenger going to fight the hijackers while the other civilian passengers sit uninterested in their seats. You never see or hear from the Navy SEALS again. 

In Dunkirk (2017), at the end of the movie, we see all the little ships turn up, sailed by civilians. In my United 93 analogy, this would be like the rest of the passengers suddenly jumping up from their seats without discussion or hesitation, to break down the cockpit door.

Finally, Dunkirk (2017) shows one single pass load of the soldiers being saved, instead of the multiple dangerous trips that the little ships took over the days that the evacuation took place. This would be like United 93's final fight where the passengers suddenly are given guns and wipe out the hijackers in seconds, [instead of the brutal struggle that actually occurred.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcdnf0Ckxmc) The Navy SEALS are presumably still in the cargo hold. 

Then the plane crashes and it comes up with a dedication to the lives that were lost in 9/11. 

You'd be frustrated and confused after watching my version of United 93. You wouldn't like the fact they mentioned the Navy SEALS (because all they did was sit in the cargo hold and die without adding anything to the story), you'd be frustrated that the people who REALLY DIED were depicted having a much easier time in the film version, you'd be annoyed that there was no discussion amongst the passengers before they heroically broke down the door. You'd be annoyed that instead of being upset about the death of the passengers, you were wondering what the Navy SEALS were going to do. 

You'd feel like the United 93 would have been problematic, but the fact it claimed to be about a real event (9/11) would make you more frustrated than if it was fictional. The people on board the real life flight in 2001 did a brave thing. They saved many lives. A movie that tries to ""Blockbusterize"" the event by giving them guns and cutting out any discussion/conflict scenes would feel 'cheap' and tacky. It wouldn't be fair to the people who died on that flight to show the world a version of events like that. **United 93** would be made weaker if John Wick single handedly killed all the terrorists (Like Tom Hardy single handedly taking down all those planes, even without an engine, then landing perfectly). **United 93** would be made weaker if the plane was brought down by 2 people instead of showing everyone working together (Like how Dunkirk ommitted the immense sacrifice of the french to protect the beach for as long as they could). **United 93** would be made weaker if they were shown a bunch of parachutes on the plane at the end (like how tens of thousands of men were left behind after the Germans swept the beach). 

This is how I feel about Dunkirk (2017). 

I understand that Nolan wanted to take the film in a certain direction. I understand that I'm in the minority when I say that I didn't like the direction he took. I'm not trying to convince anybody who liked the film that they're wrong. I'm simply trying to demonstrate via a (hopefully more familiy) analogy how frustrated it made me feel, despite the fantastic visual and sound design. 

If this STILL doesn't make sense, don't worry. It's a shitty analogy. I'm just trying to draw parallels between two true stories. Hopefully my analogy shed's some light, but if not, that's fine too. ",6ol0kp
dki9rqi,"I completely agree. This movie could have been fantastic as a straightforward narrative I like what Nolan tried to do by never showing us the Nazi's and stuff like that (Harry being almost crushed by the medical ship was excellent) but this movie needed to have Heart, and I feel like he bet it all on ""awe"", which for simply wasn't enough. If it was fiction I might have been more forgiving, but it feels squandered to me. Like if someone had made Apollo 11 into a tragedy about humans destroying the environment. You're taking a miracle, and a story that should be told, and twisting it to suit your vision, rather than to tell the story. 

(I'm not accusing Nolan of being political or anything, ""Nolan-ized"" is a great word, and it sums up a lot of how I felt.) 

I'm fine with Directors trying to their own take. Hell, it's why I was so excited for this one. I simply think it doesn't deserve a 'free pass' if I feel like it didn't work. The attempt of having the multiple timelines sync up is 100% Nolan, but (for me) it didn't work because I knew that the evacuation wasn't just a single afternoon, and there clearly wasn't room for hundreds of thousands of men to escape in a single afternoon, yet the movie tried to position me to think that those civilians simply did all this in an afternoon, instead of going out into danger over and over and over again in this historical and heroic monument to the everyman. ",6ol0kp
dkk6o1s,"Well, so far I the only thing I really missed was that the boy putting on the boots had a discarded French jacket. I assumed he'd just looted the corpse for the boots. That's a nice detail that I'd have picked up from a second viewing. 

I haven't learned anything else, however. I know the Old Man lost his hurricane pilot son 3 weeks into the war. I know he wanted to go help. I feel like I noticed and appreciated a lot of the little 'moments' in the movie, but the moments couldn't make up for a lack of progress, or to make up for the pointless plot points like the fight in the leaky ship about too much weight. George's death still seems out of place and 'pointless' from a story telling perspective (as is the whole tension about locking Cillian in the room). 

I will almost certainly end up rewatching Dunkirk, and I hope I'll enjoy it more when I do, but it probably won't be for another few years, and I don't think I'll ever be able to give it anything above a 7 at best. (I consider it a 5.5 or 6/10 right now). 

The Dark Knight might be my favorite movie, and Inception is a masterpiece, but I simply don't feel the tension or drama for these characters, because at no point do I begin to care about them. 

Batman vs Superman is a movie of nothing but silly sub plots and awesome looking moments. I didn't like it. 

Civil War has moments of tension and emotion. I loved it. 

Dunkirk seems to be given a free pass for having many of the flaws the BvS did, which seems completely insane to me. BvS had some beautiful shots and moments, but that wasn't a 9/10 film. Dunkirk had some great shots and moments (the guy under the burning oil and the soldiers running down the street at the start were excellently done) but neither movie felt like anything more than a great big spectacle. 

The moment the little ships arrive at the beach just felt empty. It should have been a stand-up-and-cheer moment, but I just felt like ""Yep, they said they'd be here.... why aren't they being driven by the navy guys?"" ",6ol0kp

Obviously you don't need every specific detail of a person's life to be touched by their death.  But when you know that person - their dreams, who they love, what drives them - it definitely causes their loss to effect you more.  That's just how we work as human beings.  That's why the only moment in the film that made any sort of meaningful emotional impact was when the boy died - because we knew something about the person he was, rather than simply the surface level struggles he was facing.

Wave his hand? from a plane over 500 ft in the air. How would he coordinate the clearing of an airstrip with soldiers from diferent platoons? Pilots were treated pretty decently after being captured as well so it is not like he is marching towards his death.

Try a mile at the very least or more depending on altitude you're coming from and what speed you're starting with. It's not a difficult concept. The German soldiers were literally coming in from the eastern side (this is explicitly mentioned in the film by the Lt. two scenes prior). So since Tom Hardy's character lands on the far eastern side he runs into the German front line that is making its way to the evacuation site.

For reference modern planes will glide for 170-210km from over 30,000 feet. With that being an old plane, being damaged, and coming down around less than a sixth of that height it doesn't take much of an imagination as to why he was forced to land where he did.",6ol0kp

I've been thinking a lot about it, and I think most of my problems with the movie were a result of me not coming in with the right expectations of what it was going to be about, e.g. not knowing dick about Dunkirk and assuming there would be more of a climactic 'battle' or some kind of obvious climax, and so I want to see it again knowing more what I'm in for.

He should focus on projects that show off his original, smart storytelling as well as his directing skills, and not just his directing skills which I think Dunkirk only did.

I became a fan of his after Interstellar and as I'm sure you'd know that was a God damn space epic, maybe it's my fault for having these kinds of expectations, idk.",6ol0kp
dkjipqp,"I mean more plot points and character arcs and stuff, story beats etc. This is sort of just one event, one tone the whole movie. Which is fine but with a movie like Inception and Interstellar things happen, plot changes every few minutes with new revelations and plot twists etc. Writing a story essentially. Whereas this felt more like Nolan asked himself, ""They survive so how many different scenes and different ways can I film that?"" There isn't really a plot besides the set-up at the beginning.",6ol0kp

dkk2dkz,I get that completely but honestly all of nolans other movies were more attractive to watch and think about because there were these great visually (as dunkirk was) but he could have at least gave us something more with the 12 characters that it focused on. He spent so much time on these certain people but at the end of the film i care about them about as much as i did walking into it. I could of understood the struggle within 25 minutes of the movie and yes i get that wasnt his intention for this film but still,6ol0kp

But that's the problem - with this character the war has already ''finished' Tommy character arc before the film even starts. These are not the ingredients of good drama.

Its one thing with the guy rescued from the sunken u-boat whose character arc is already finished before the film begins ....we do not go through four more near-death experiences with him as we do with Tommy so its OK if he remains essentially 'static'. But to have so many characters in a state of catatonia does not make for a very compelling film overall.

I cared a lot more about Tom Hanks and Matt Damon in ""Saving Private Ryan"".  I feel like I should have cared more about Mark Rylance or cared more about Tom Hardy.  The characterization was VERY thin.   

Now, I get that when you add characterization, it can have drawbacks or feel like you're taking something away from the very real people who had to suffer through this stuff.  I imagine if they made a 2 hour movie about the Titanic sinking... and just cut between the boiler room, the captain, and people drowning... just two hours of the boat sinking with the boat as the focus, it would have been similar to what Nolan did here.   Does adding fictional characters (Rose and Jack) help you relate to the survivors and make for a better film?  Yeah.   Does it make it less dull?  Yeah.  

But I guess if the goal here was to make a historical recreation worthy of hardcore war documentary enthusiasts, they succeeded.",6ol0kp

Look, I'm not saying ""Titanic"" is a great film, but would it have been better without Rose/Jack... where it was just 2 hours of a ship sinking, people running around with life jackets, cutting between the captain, the band playing, the boiler room, and the ship sinking?

dkmpl4f,"Me and the woman had a discussion about that on the hour long trip from the theater,and she sees it from your perspective.

We came to this understanding ; with Nolans other works the characters are defined by their actions in the story as a response to challenges and dangers. We know who Harvey Dent & Murphy Cooper are enough to identify and see their perspectives through the struggles endured in the story,and how the story is changed from their actions.

With *Dunkirk* Nolan went the other way. The characters make choices ,but the situation of war is dictating their actions for them. We have no idea who ANY of the characters are; not the pilot ,not the kids in the Army,not the navy guys. The closest we come to traditional characters are two officers on a pier we see maybe twice in the whole story. And one random dude who really doesn't like the RAF. 
Worse ,their actions don't change a thing; the kids barely avoid death by luck of the draw,and a civilian dies by what amounts to a tragic accident. The pilot is the closest character that's making an impact on things-and even he runs out of fuel . 
The overall theme is no one is in control during a war,but as a team -including civilians- even bad odds can be overcome to victory. 

It's a great theme and one that's fairly close to reality in terms of military service,but Nolan had to depersonalize his characters in order for that story to work. It's not going to fly with everyone, but it meets my seal of approval.",6ol0kp

I keep seeing ""This movie didn't glorify the horrors of war like all other war films I've seen"" There have been movies for decades that have shown the horror of war. People who say Saving Private Ryan is a shallow film jerking off American patriotism must have had their eyes closed. This film is garbage in that respect. 
For one thing, theres no blood which was probably just done to include a bigger audience and make more money. There was not a lot of very intense scenes related to death or near death. Sure some people got shot, the kid bumped his head, and the pilot almost drowns along with several others (not in way any more effective than the fucking Pearl Harbor movie). Guess what, no one gave a shit about the pilot cause we barely know him. I know people are saying character development is irrelevant to this film but that is simply fucking stupid. Nolan is showing me this drowning man in a way that is clearly suppose to have an emotional effect which would be enhanced by giving more of a shit about him. If its about the event itself then why bother with close-ups or intimate moments such as these when you know they are fruitless exercises. 

For example in Private Ryan we know a bit about the characters based of interaction and exposition (we don't even need flashbacks or anything to establish this), so when these moments come up, when someone is being slowly stabbed or has their face blown off, it is absolutely gut wrenching. Even the opening scene of the movie. We know nothing about the people on the boat but even then it is one of the most intense scenes in film history with hundreds slaughtered on the shore. 

Dunkirk opens in a similar sort of way, of course the situation is less dire than running directly into machine gun fire but its still fucking war so I expect to feel some butterflies. But alas not much. I'm just watching these guys run a stretcher towards a boat while some bombs dropping. It was a cool sequence but it doesn't have the same effect. This says something about the comparison of the two films because character development isn't even a factor in the opening scene of a movie. Spielburg did this much better than Nolan.

I could come up with some more examples. But when I see people calling this the best war movie ever or even in recent years, I have to shake my head. We've got many movies and shows that have done what Nolan did except 10 times better, and everyone is acting like he's the fucking British Jesus crossed with The Beatles.

Engine damage can simply seize your pistons, and governors that rely on positive oil pressure can cause blades to go full coarse on engine failure, producing maximum blade drag and slowing them to a stop rapidly. Generally you will find that the prop does still rotate at a few degrees/sec regardless of how coarse the pitch is though.",6ol0kp

dkjuouz,Enough.,6ol0kp
dkjtuxv,"LOL. How do people find this comment after so many PR astroturfing accounts dug me in?

The unrealistic elements were mostly combat but that's mostly because I was looking for them. I knew from the reviews and prior experience with Nolan that the characters and dialogues would be bullshit but I thought he would give it a tryand at least attempt a semblance of realism. 

For example the opening scene made no sense from the tactical perspective both for the Germans and for the running Brits.  The French infantry was more like a guarding post than a defensive position (where's the machine gun?) The chasing Germans would have a machine gun of their own as every German squad had one - that was a major innovation at the time - and that would be it for the runners. End of film for this particular character.

The beach at Dunkerque was way too orderly - it was a mess with the equipment and vehicles all over the place. Atonement did that much better.

The aircraft of the Luftwaffe would not fly single plane sorties.  Two minimum for fighter patrols for example. The bombing runs were done badly. Heinkels would fly in formation while Stukas would go for solo dives. I am not sure which day of the operation it was but there were two days where Stukas sunk many ships (dive bombing is precise, horizontal bombing not so much) and that's how the ships would really be sunk.  I had a weird feeling that the siren was wrong too but that might have been acoustics. i have never been bombed by Stukas so I do not know. I only know what it sounds like when it goes off next to you.

The torpedo blast also was a bit confusing and the results on the ship were unrealistic. Most importantly the U-boat - if it was that - would surface at night unless a destroyer was present nearby (then it would attempt to sink the destroyer).

The dogfights were kind of weird.  Bombers did not shoot back nor tried to evade. Bfs were more targets than competent opponents and there was no real sense of urgency in the fighting.

The Little ships coming to the rescue were all bullshit invented by American journtalists and the man going to Dunkerque with two young boys is borderline unrealistic. Unless they have something like that on paper I highly doubt it. 

Also there were days when the weather was really bad which would mean that the sea would be rough so such small ship wouldn't do much. 

Etc etc.

Saving Private Ryan was way better. Fury which was a bullshit film on its own was much better in that regard.

They didn't give them to pilots because they felt they would jump out if their planes were hit rather than trying to save the plane. So by WWII parachutes had been around and tested for at least 25 years.

I also said it was safer to ditch into the sea as the planes would slide a bit if the sea was calm. But tons of guys bailed out of planes safely. The main danger (as I said) was getting clear of the tail. G Bush Sr. got hit on the head when he bailed out of his torpedo plane.",6ol0kp

dkwoeil,"The French did, as did the Belgians, as did the British. The film deliberately chooses not to portray any of the fighting, because it wanted to focus on the isolation of the troops and the stories of their evacuation.

There were many things happening that bought them time. Notably, diversion operations and most important of all the fact that the Germans decided to transfer the troops to the Western front instead of approach Dunkirk from the ground. This is mentioned in the film - the admiral questions why the German tanks have halted their advance and is told ""why waste precious tanks when they can pick us off from the air - we're fish in a barrel"".

So, of course not to detract from the French/Belgian efforts, but the Germans didn't intend a ground attack anyway. It was unnecessarily costly. If the film tried to incorporate every effort regardless of it's outcome, it would quickly derail from the main focus. You'd have to show Indian efforts, Canadian efforts and countless others.

dkjzjeq,Yep. I have a new appreciation for the movie knowing all of this.,6ol0kp
dkwqaj8,The mole refers to how long it would take an actual mole to cross the english channel.,6ol0kp
dkjzcwm,"No it's like the commenter above me said. 

The mole (the beach) story took place in the span of one week, the sea (civilian ships) story took place in the span of one day, the air (Tom hardy) story took place in the span of one hour. ",6ol0kp

But the bullets create a pretty steady stream through the air, so a shot down the body of the plane timed so that the bullets are right about in the air at the same time the plane is going through the line could possibly land hits. That's why it's a movie moment. It's technically possible, while it wouldn't work 99.9% of the time",6ol0kp

dkq6o9j,"I'll do my best. So the German plane was flying overhead with a straight path towards the boat with the intent to bomb them. Common knowledge would say that they should steer the boat a different direction so that the plane's bombs will miss. Problem is if they change directions too early that leaves the bomber with the opportunity to change his course and still hit the boat. If they steer to late then they won't be far enough from the bomb when it hits the water. The old man waited until just the right time when the bomber had committed to his line but with enough time to steer out of the bomb's path. The bomber missed and decided it was more worth his time to get a naval ship than try again for the civilian boat. The technique saved their lives.

The pilot watched the old man do this maneuver and then asked where he learned it from. The old man told the pilot that his son used to be in the Air Force until he was killed.  ",6ol0kp

I don't remember the specific parts, but there were parts of The Prestige where I feel like if the dialogue was at a good level, the sound effects were way too loud, and not like a gunshot or something, just like a curtain or something.

The motivation for treating enemy prisoners well is that you want the enemy to reciprocate that same treatment towards the prisoners they capture. Hitler was well aware of this.",6ol0kp

I don't imagine most German soldiers fought for the ideals of Nazism (although the perceived benefits of the regime to the country might have convinced some), rather I think many, probably most, fought for Germany as a country, as their country. This though ignores the fact that most servicemen were conscripts, who might not have ""fought"" for any particular reason, other than survival of himself and his friends. 


Although of course, this doesn't excuse the warcrimes committed by the ordinary Heer, I am well aware that the ""clean Wehrmacht"" is a myth.

Dunkirk is a movie about three different timelines and stories about people that come together to save the day. It wasn't about a character or their back story but just war.

Dunkirk was the right story, the right film to be made, but with the wrong director. 
It's not one of his best films to date, absoluetly not, it didn't have that thrill, that excitement in which Inception and The Dark Knight had. ""Let's make sure this ship gets caught on fire because it will make it look dramatic"", it just doesn't work for me. 

There was no character building at all, and it doesn't give us any sympathy when one of the characters dies because we know NOTHING about them and their background. 

It's not realistic at all. I'm pretty sure i didn't see a single drop of blood in the film, a WAR film may i add. This film is getting great ratings because of the advertisements it had, ""Oh it's a warm film, it must be good!"". 

The sounds in the film and the cinematography was gorgeous. But, the film felt very empty. I wasn't on the edge of my seat, i wasn't holding my breathe at times - In which was Nolan's goal in this film.

It was reported that he got away from his plane as fast as he could and walked something like a hundred miles through enemy territory ending up in Brussels where he went to the US embassy, which refused to take him in as they were not yet involved in the war. With nowhere to go he surrendered and became a prisoner of war.""

But it should not always be used as a criticism. If that was true, Bergman, Tarvosky and Godard(a director I actually don' like much) would be called the worst film directors ever instead of the most influential and best. A plot and character development(both of which was there) is not something that can be critisized if the director doesn't want to focus on that. It can be critisized if the director wants to rely on both those elements but fails to make them developed enough. Film is a form of art, not a form of storytelling.",6ol0kp

It was really eye-opening and sobering for me, as an American, to see what the Brits went through - particularly so close to their own homeland.

The concrete idea of what I expected are the components of most movies. A plot, characters, story arc, etc. As I watched Dunkirk, it felt like less of a movie and more of a series of short films on tension. 

I got the same reaction watching the two minute trailer as I did watching the entire film. I don't think it added much. I also believe it was quite repetitive, to the point where I felt like I was watching the same scenes over and over again, to the point that it really uninspired me.

And I don't see the reason for George to die, or for a soldier to have to get off the boat ""It's too heavy! One person has to get off!""  feels so cheesy. Tom Hardy is a beautiful man, but that last Stuka he takes down felt silly to me. 

And no, you can keep saying ""Go see it again"" over and over without convincing me.

The British are cautious about losing aircraft and ships due to the expected need to defend against a German invasion of England. The shallow water and single dock ""The Mole"" create a logistical problem for getting men off the beach (this is discussed in depth by the officers). Civilian ships are pressed into service as a rescue force. Many more of the British soldiers are evacuated than was expected. Churchill gives his famous speech. It's all there.

I was a bit of a WW2 nut when I was a kid and loved visiting places like the war museums in London and Ottawa Canada. 

So, when I heard about this film I was thinking 'oh wow maybe Nolan can finally put it all together and make a near-perfect film (I only think Inception is close thus far) AND it would be so amazing if it happened to also be about a subject I am personally really into!'

Being objective, I had nearly impossible expectations and pretty much barring a miracle was bound to be disappointed.

I think over the past few days I've been trying to re-assess my feelings about the film and realize that he did not make the Dunkirk I wanted but he did (pretty much) still achieve….*something*.

It's been interesting to spend time in this thread and see what others have had to say although I think at this point it's pretty much all been covered. Sometimes someone just says the pretty much the same thing but in a better way and you're like 'oh that was a good post.'

The movie for sure still had the Nolan elements that I think are holding him back from making truly amazing films by and large.

Wrong. This movies reception is overwhelmingly positive everywhere, including reddit look at fan scores and the number of units on positive comments here vs the number of units on comments critical of the film. What you're parading around as fact is nothing but confirmation bias, regardless of how many times you can call people fanboys. Just because you see a few chains of critical comments per Dunkirk thread don't mean reception is split. Vocal minority/silent majority effects have been present on Reddit and other online forums since the Advent of the internet. If I go into a Dunkirk thread and see a thousand people already expressing my thoughts about the movie, I'm less likely to be refinance and comment the same thing, whereas if I have a contrary opinion to the majority, I'm more likely to put in my two cents.

>It should be closer to universal praise.

You really just don't understand how internet forums work. 

>I'm not the only one who didn't like this movie. In fact, a lot of people didn't like this movie.

A lot of people not liking the film doesn't mean reception is split, a lot of people seeing the film is going to mean that a lot of people dislike it. Because with literally every popular thing out there, there are a lot of people that are going to dislike it. Plus, vocal people like you that love to belittle the opinions of others are all hurrying to do so as quickly and as often as possible. 

>And how did I think my opinion was so important? I just gave my honest opinion and here you are getting heated cause some random person you don't even know didn't enjoy this movie. 

No. You didn't simply dislike the movie, you outright said that people who like the movie after fanboys that are lying to themselves about liking it because they're Chris's Nolan fanboys that aren't allowed to dislike anything he makes. It's a ridiculous and juvenile point to try and make. I know plenty of people that either aren't fans of Nolan or aren't fans of this film, and all of them are able to critique the film without putting down the opinions of others in an effort to make yours seem more important than they are. Their opinions after as valid as my own about the film, which happens to be overwhelmingly positive.

If you *dislike* the film, say so, say why, and move on. If you *enjoy* the film, say so, say why, and move on. Don't tell people their opinions after irrelevant because they're blinded by being a fanboy and then play it off like you're adding useful discourse to the conversation.

drnwnp1,"The soldiers are grouped together in formations where evacuation would be quicker and efficient, a scattered formation would hinder the efforts of evacuation and would significantly slow them down giving the enemy more time to advance.
&nbsp;

The reason why they aren't prepared for the bombers is because they weren't supposed to bombed easily at all, the RAF were commanded to keep the enemy off the beach and take down any bombers. However the RAF was spread thin because they were busy fighting the Luftwaffe. The soldiers were unaware since the RAF was scarce to see, read on from this excerpt from the wiki:

>The RAF continued to take a heavy toll on the German bombers throughout the week. Soldiers being bombed and strafed while awaiting transport were for the most part unaware of the efforts of the RAF to protect them, as most of the dogfights took place far from the beaches. As a result, many British soldiers bitterly accused the airmen of doing nothing to help.

If you're talking about the moment itself then it comes down to drill training, you don't jump out of the window during an earthquake, you do the drills they teach you in school. First of all, if the ports and mole are bombed and destroyed then you might as well have stopped the evac, it's the RAFs job to stop that from happening. If you're getting bombed on the beach then you do the drills, you don't run like an idiot because there's a high chance shrapnel would hit you.
&nbsp;

There is no British and French stupidity, when you're out there in war it's a percentages game full of dilemmas: Stay on the port and duck or run back to the beach? Run away from the bombers or duck and hold? Do you do as you're trained or do you follow your instincts?",6ol0kp

Good movies make light of reality, AND entertain you. This just didnt even try. It decided to go the avenue of half silent film, half old war movie, and part documentarian pedantism. For me this does not equate to something enjoyable, nor interesting, nor something to aknowledge as a great work. It's a lazy film, using lazy tactics to drive the plot. With lazy writing to ignore characters. It tries so hard to do so little its very strange to see so many people defending it.",6ol0kp

I will cite an example. Guys body blows up in an early scene. He vanishes. Nowhere is there even a trace amount of horror. 

War is bloody. All war. 

However a bloody war move gets an R for violence. 

How we gonna have a blockbuster with an R?  

Just my opinion that this film felt sanitized for mass consumption. Which lowers my true heartfelt rating for this film. Unlike some who just want Nolan to be the next legendary director. 

To be fair this film has always been more about Nolan than the actual topic. Just an observation. ",6ol0kp

Edit: To add to the BishopAkula's comment, the blonde boy is Mr. Dawson's son Peter. After Mr. Dawson answered and went inside, Collins (the pilot) asked Peter a bit incredulously if he was in the RAF.

dkn7oui,"Well the last thing the film does is glorify or fantasise the horrible and gruesome murders of tens of thousands of young men.

Much like films about slavery, a film like Dunkirk aims to educate society on the lessons we’ve learnt from these horrendous moments in history. Dunkirk’s goal is to highlight the values of community spirit that were instilled in Britain from the mass evacuation. It’s not that the violence is fascinating. The visceral and gut-wrenching way in which the story is told is what’s fascinating. Undeniably, some of the aerial combat is a visual spectacle (from a filmmaking perspective), but gunfire and bombs are treated highly sorrowfully in the film.

As for Nolan’s films being shallow, everybody has a different interpretation of the film’s they watch. I would completely disagree as his films are some of the most complex and exhilarating I’ve ever seen, but we all have our own tastes so I’m not going to try and prove you wrong.",6ol0kp

If you're right I either got the wrong information, or they were upgraded before the Battle of Britain. As far as I knew, the 109s were the ones with fuel shortages and couldn't stay in the battle for long, so when a 109 was hit in the fuel tank there was a very high chance of them not making it back home, but the Spitfires had enough fuel to chase them to France and then return",6ol0kp

dkvl9t6,"I saw three title cards: mole - one week, sea - one day, air - one hour.

Maybe I'm an idiot, but I think most (not all!) of the people saying it was obvious paid attention to the publicity or read the wikipedia article before.  I had no idea it was three timelines.  I thought those title cards were saying how much time till the big battle, and I was confused why these ""chapters"" happened so quickly and didn't return later.

I do not know how to make it clearer, but I'm not a famed Hollywood director or screenwriter.  I suppose one rather obvious way is to put ""time to convergence: one day"", but that may be a bit heavy handed.  Or maybe, possibly, just putting the date and and time?  Although I do not think most people would pay attention to a specific date and notice that the dates are different, because the specific date of the event is rather unimportant.  ",6ol0kp

> I would understand if you missed the first ten minutes of the film you might find the timelines disorienting... but if you clearly saw those three titles then it was obvious that we're dealing with three different timelines. One that starts one week ago, one day ago, and one hour ago.

because just saying the setting and a measurement of time is not the same as saying ""the events in the mole take place over the course of a week, the events in the sea take place over the course of a day, and the events in the air take place over the course of an hour"". it's a stripped down version of that information and i didn't understand what it was trying to say in the moment. maybe if i didn't have three teenagers distracting me for the bulk of the film, i might have put it together later, or maybe not. congratulations on getting it, but try to imagine that your experience is not everyone else's",6ol0kp

The first time it changed from night to day I was completely fucking confused as to what was happening because the title cards made no sense to me. By the time I figured it out, I was just annoyed at Nolan for not making it clear enough and hampering my understanding of the film in the beginning.

Protagonist: Ryan

Antagonist: This one is the most loosely designed element in SPR, because of the location jumping - but each location does have an antagonist. Examples include the German sniper and the Tiger tank + crew. You could say ""the Nazis"" in a way you couldn't for Dunkirk - after all, a few planes is the only showing of the German forces in the entire movie.

There's no set criteria as to what is ""better"" action. You can't claim objectivity on this, it's not math. Different things appeal to different people. 

I think Nolan is a rather middle of the road filmmaker and misses more than he hits. That's my opinion.

Stop mistaking your opinion for fact. THAT'S why you're being down voted, not because of your opinion, but simply because you don't understand what an opinion is--rookie stuff, man.

But Gibson (or if not, whoever that last soldier was below deck), couldn't quite make it to the ladder and drowned with his hands reaching out.

Was the character who drowned at the ladder Gibson? And either way, why was he so intent on staying below deck of a clearly sinking ship when all others had left? Once retrieved, he seemed to want to escape, but couldn't quite make it.

Seemed odd that the whole group would think the boat could get anywhere with as many holes in it as it had, especially when they tried to physically push out the water.

dkk98ow,"First of all: You're 100% right. Interstellar's was extremely clunky, Dunkirk's wasn't. I exaggerated that unfairly. 

Seeing the timeline sync up might be really cool, but it felt underwhelming the first time. I can understand that a second time might not feel like that, so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. 

I agree that they wouldn't have been rational, but as an audience member that moment/drama/subplot made me want to roll my eyes from a movie perspective (other moments had already done that, like the latch) but it felt like it was a pointless moment. If one of boys had offered to sacrifice their lives or something it would have ""made sense"" because I would have felt something as an audience member (yes, that would have been cliche'd too), but I that scene doesn't have any resolution, so it felt unsatisfying. Nolan didn't have the cringy ""Look at this picture of my girlfriend"" moment, but if I feel the exact same way about ""There's 7 of us and only room for 6!"" plot/drama device, I'm not exactly won over. 

I'm not trying to convince you that you were wrong to change your mind about it the second time. I'm thoroughly enjoying this back and forth discussion. 

> Easy for you to say sitting in the comfort of your home.

Minor point, but I was in IMAX. Plenty of good movies have had similar moments where I was as panicked/anxious/tense/irrational as the characters, and couldn't clearly think about their situation until after the movie had ended. Nolan's done that, as have plenty of other directors, so I don't think they ""You weren't there"" argument applies. If I was watching the movie out of order on youtube, sure, but I was there in the cinema, and I simply didn't buy it. 

George's death didn't convey those points for me, and I'm still struggling to see them with depth. They feel weak to me. I know death can come from unexpected places, George's death didn't teach me that. I know life is fragile and death can come from anywhere, George's death didn't convince me/teach me that. I'm not sure I follow about the Legend of Dunkirk thing, but I feel like George's lack of heroic actions (despite being a hero in the paper, which was a nice but sappy moment) didn't resonate. He fell down his head and hit his head any day of the week. He didn't risk his life over and over again to save those soldiers, he died before they got into combat. I don't feel I can defend this point in particularly well, so I'll move on to better ones, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. His death felt a bit soap-opera to me, a cheap attempt at making me feel a little bit sadder. 

Final point (Sorry about the bottom - to - top response structure I've been employing in my comments, I'm just trying to cover every point you addressed. 

I wasn't looking for a bland war hero protagonist. I was looking for a human being I could connect to. I didn't need to see he had a girlfriend or child or job or something specific, but I definitely needed a name. Without a name, the man on the beach blown up next to him by the Stuka (The awesome shot where the explosions approach the camera) has the same emotional impact. I don't mourn stormtroopers who die in Star Wars, or nameless civilians in the background of disaster movies. I mourn and care about people I connect with. For me, I can form that connection through an incredibly small window, like a name and ""my Dad misses me"". 

I know the response to that is 
""Can't you work that out for youself?  Of course his Dad probably misses him!"" 
To which I say ""Sure, but there were 399,999 other men on that beach who had Dads who were probably missing them. Why should I care about Harry Styles any more than the soldier 3 people ahead of him down the line?"" 

I accept that my expections had a huge role in my disapointment, BUT that's because I like the Director. When I realised how the three timelines were chronologically split, I was excited to see the moment they all synced up at the climax, so when the climax was Tom Hardy saving ANOTHER ship, it really didn't feel worth while. I wasn't terrified the bomber would blow it up, I simply didn't care either way. Honestly, I thought ""OH shit he's going to kamikazie his plane into the bomber to save those people!"" but he didn't. He just shot it down (like every other), then shot down another plane without fuel, then landed perfectly at the *last possible second* despite not having working landing gear.....  It left a bad taste in my mouth. 

Final point: The burning spitfire at the end had a metal crankshaft attached to the propeller, and no engine. It was a great cinematic shot, and by that point, I'd already felt that Nolan was too Hollywood to claim realism and too heartless to be a 'dumb' war movie. I simply don't think going back to watch it would sweep those feelings away. I could be wrong, but I'm not going to waste $20 and a whole evening on it without first being SURE I was going to see something new in it. ",6ol0kp

""BETTER HIM THAN ME"" Those were Alex's words. And trust me, if you were in that kind of situation he was, you'd be like that too.

Then I saw it again in IMAX and it was COMPLETELY different. I'm not sure if it was because of IMAX 100% though.

dkrizyy,"""What would that movie have been?""

The million dollar question!

Well, I guess when I heard about the project I thought that with Nolan-money and Nolan-vision the project would have a bit more scope. 

I *for sure* did not need shots of Churchill sitting around a table full of maps with his generals or similar scenes with Hitler but I think a bit more establishing…information would have been nice.

It's really hard to answer because I'm trying to answer without talking about what I just saw. I think the land/sea/air triptych would be good to build around but the seven-day portion for example would have given the opportunity to show more about what happened on the beach during that time. People losing it, scenes of black-humour, destroying materiel etc. There could have been mellow expository dialog to assist newcomers to the story with soldiers talking on the beach.

I guess I would be unhappy with 'The Longest Day' and I probably would have been unhappy with a full 'Thin Red Line' approach (although I do love that movie(heck I love The Longest Day too)) but I think maybe something that was more firmly either might have worked more for me. It bothers me that a film that opens with some pretty daring film-making (in its own quiet way) of the initial shots of the soldiers trying to reach the beach also has a shot of Kenneth Branagh with tears in his eyes when the little boats arrive. I dunno, I wish he went full art-house or full Pearl Harbour (well, not really).

But see now I've gone back to discussing the movie we saw not the movie I wanted!

""Like what? Out of curiosity, but especially since I feel like part of the narrative people have is that this movie shirked certain 'Nolan-isms' e.g. a twist, being 150 minutes long, etc.""

Yeah I suppose there was not much he could do about a large-scale twist ending working with a real-life event but I do think the day/week/hour device was a bit bungled and a very 'Nolan' thing. There was individual tension but I think jumping between hurt the overall sense of urgency. 

I will admit that when I heard a couple weeks ago about the relatively short run-time I was like 'why is he finally doing this to a movie I am so interested in!' and then talked myself into it. Overall I am firmly into the 'hey try and see if you can say all you want to say in 95 minutes' but a little extra dusting of footage here and there might have helped I think.

I read today in this thread that someone called it an excellent popcorn movie and I think that is an apt description and not as much of a back-handed compliment as it sounds like at first. I just can't help thinking the film had a bit more potential than that. 
I think that like a lot of people these days I invest too much in the anticipation of the work and then it's almost impossible to meet my expectations. I expect I'll be posting a lot in the Blade Runner 2049 thread when that movie comes out!

I think the movie at times does provoke a primal horror/dread that speaks to universal themes of humanity but I was expecting that *plus* a bit more content that was specific to the event. 

On one hand it's interesting that the fellows on the beach really could BE anywhere and FROM anywhere but on the other I'm like that's a bit of a lost opportunity.

For all my quibbles though any Nolan is a must-see to me.

There isn't blood and gore, you don't see Stuka bombs ripping people apart.

I think the film wants us to feel how they felt, it's a bit dreamlike like plenty of Nolan films, in that situation you only care about survival, you 'look away' from mutilation and ultimately the fear in war is not about blood and body parts. The fear and the anxiety you feel in the movie is all about the feeling every grenade or bullet could end YOUR life and that's why I like it so much. I think the movie is all about that, the feeling of war, panic, getting shot at, being hopeless facing modern war machinery. It's not about larger than life characters who want to die for their country and who shoot 50 Nazis and who regular people can't easily relate to because let's face it, regular dudes like you and me, and 99,5 % of every soldier in every army when faced with terrible odds and danger just want to get out of the battle alive.

The fact that Dunkirk doesn't conform to conventional methods of filmmaking insofar as character development and storytelling goes doesn't preclude it from being judged as different from the genre of war film. The problem I'm seeing is that people seem to have thought this would be a war movie like all other war movies that are incredibly character driven and explore the human condition within the context and confines of the hell that is war. This was not the film Nolan intended to make, its not the experience he decided to give the audience. The attitude and expectation of a viewer like you wanting something different from a film than what the Director intended to create is not an invalid distinction. If someone goes into Guardians of the Galaxy 2 expecting a Greek tragedy in space, then it is the audience member's fault for wanting something beyond the vision and execution of the director and all else involved. 

Dunkirk being a straightforward depiction of an event was so because Christopher Nolan willed it to be. So yes I think it's valid to say that you wanting the film to be something other than it ended up being is really a you problem. There is an artistry in how this film was made.

I noticed there were chains inside the Grounded Ship, which made sounds each time one of the soldiers moved when being shot at, and I think Gibson may have been tangled in these as he finally tried to leave, preventing him from doing so.

> Is the ship scene almost a time of temporary madness via desperation for the characters? 

I'd say so; they are already in a desperate, awful situation on the beach, and to be trapped in an old ship, under fire and faced with the fact that the ship is too heavy to set off, was too much. They will have known the right thing to do (to offer to leave to save the rest of the group) but were not prepared to do this, making emotions run high as they try to foist the responsibility onto someone else. I also noticed as they entered the ship, one soldier mentioned that they only had to wait 3 hours for the tide to rise. This was shortly after the scene in which Commander Bolton corrects the Army officer who makes the same assertion, stating it is 6 hours until high tide. So on top of all the pressures mentioned above, the solders had to wait inside the ship 3 hours longer than they thought.

> ...is just not plausible nor aesthetic. All that exposition will take you out of the movie and just wouldn't make sense -- the whole film had minimal dialogue and characterization specifically for this reason. I think he made the rational decision.

of course it's plausible. and everything is aesthetic. hypothetically, you actually could put clearer text at each timeline establishing screen. every episode of 24 season 1 would start with something like ""the following takes place between midnight and 1am on the day of the california presidential primary. events occur in real time."" that's an example of unmistakably clear establishing text. you wouldn't even need that much for *dunkirk*, and it certainly wouldn't take you out of the film. what did take me out of the film was being confused by those title cards.

i shouldn't have refuted the ""shared"" part becasue thats the end goal of both but the mechanism by which you get there is different.

>Empathy is the ability to experience the feelings of another person. It goes beyond sympathy, which is caring and understanding for the suffering of others. Both words are used similarly and often interchangeably (incorrectly so) but differ subtly in their emotional meaning. 

this website has a better explination than the simple one i used earlier: http://www.diffen.com/difference/Empathy_vs_Sympathy


Empathy is something you experience yourself and because someone else experienced it the feeling can be shared but if you need to co-opt someone elses story to do it your not feeling empathy but sympathy.

edit: funny because you are making assumptions on events of the movie based on COMPLETELY false information which is exactly the kind of thing that showing how cillian murphy ended up on a boat without the 3 boys would avoid.

I accept that Nolan has a great track record. I was extremely excited for the movie. I accept that he spent months thinking about these little things I have a problem with. I respect that he tried to make something different. I accept that I'm in such a minority that he made a crowd pleasing movie that may very well stand the test of time. I do not accept, however, that his track record and ability makes him immune to criticism. I'm writing on here because 1) I like discussing the movie, and 2) I want to be convinced that I'm wrong about it. Nolan's great, and I came to r/movies to find out what it was that I missed that everyone else liked, but nobody has convinced me yet. 

Perhaps the difference between people/characters is simply a point of view that differs from us. I felt no more anxiety for Harry than I did for the nameless/faceless allied soldiers around him who died. I didn't feel loss when they were being killed by the dive bombing, so why would I feel loss for Harry? Because I saw his face a handful of times first? 
This seems to me to simply be a case of 'agree to disagree', and that's fine. I'm not looking to convince you/anybody not to like the movie, I'm trying to coax you/anybody into convincing me to like it. (Yes, I know you're saying 'you have to watch it again' but I'd feel so bitter if I felt exactly the same way about it by the end as I do now, and so far that seems like the most likely outcome.) 

If I didn't like the movie and didn't care, I simply wouldn't be writing this. I'm writing here because I want to learn something new about it other than ""it's a masterpiece and it looks/sounds great"" that makes me think ""oh shit, I need to see it again."" 

Because I know it sounds great. I know it looks great. I know it's by a director I love, about an event that I learned about as a little kid. I know that it's got good actors and physical rigs and all of that. But that didn't bother me the first time around. 

I need to be convinced that my second viewing will be different to my first, because honestly, right now, I think I'd prefer to go back and rewatch Baby Driver. That made me feel more peril and tense and excited. ",6ol0kp

You've never taken a basic course on film critique have you? An art course in general? I don't say this to be a dick to you, but I'm a former professional film critic, so let me clue you in on something:
That metacritic score is a pool of OPINIONS. Not facts. More opinions going one way does not a fact make, it just means more people like that film. 

You're using a fallacy, it's called Ad Populum. You're objectively WRONG here, sir. 

Do you know how many films have been poorly received only to later be declared masterpieces. I can name so many, but let's just start with Blade Runner. Many now consider it a masterpiece. Trashed and ""misunderstood"" upon release. Was it an objectively bad film that is now objectively one of the godfather's of sci-fi because the pool of opinions have shifted? 

Your ""logic"" is insanely flawed. 

It's okay that you think Dunkirk is better. That's perfectly fine. But it's not objective. There's no set criteria for what makes a good action sequence. Some prefer gun-fu. Some prefer the slow mo bullet ballets of Pekinpah and Woo. Some prefer the ultra realism of Michael Mann. We can sit here all day and argue opinion. But when you try to bring in objectivity you're going to get blown off and easily shut down.

Honestly, it made me like the movie a bit less. I understand better why some people think the movie is boring.

But, I do recommend watching it a second time if you can, preferably in IMAX, because it gives you a chance to focus on the more confusing scenes and to just take in the beauty of the cinematography and acting.

Why? There are plenty of great movies that leave events to the imagination. I'll use No Country For Old Men, widely considered one of the best movies of the 21st century, as an example. Llewelyn Moss, the closest thing the movie has to a main character, [is killed off-screen](#spoiler). His death is not explained but we can connect the dots. 

>why choose to make that connection if it had absolutely no meaning at all in the film? 

On the contrary, that moment was important because it's when it clicked for most people around me (and on Reddit too, apparently) that the events weren't happening at the same time and what the ""1 week, 1 day, 1 hour"" at the beginning actually meant. So saying it had absolutely no meaning at all is just plain wrong.

And David Fincher said it best: ""There are people who go through movies and look for inconsistencies and continuity errors, and they list them. I fear those people, and I also weep for them.""",6ol0kp
dkr9k69,"I felt I had to explain it because you've shown that you didn't understand many obvious things about the movie. Cillian Murphy's character was with his own regiment, the boys were outsiders. This separation is emphasised many times in the movie: at the beginning Tommy tries to join a queue and he is told that it is only for grenadiers, and on the trawler when they are trying to get Tommy and Gibson off, Harry Styles' character clearly says something like ""I'm sorry but my regiment comes first"".

""They were all in the same place at the same time so how did they get separated"" means nothing because the same thing could be said about 400,000 soldiers on that beach. There is no continuity error here.",6ol0kp
dkl3yhe,"Do you want to be reported and then banned from the sub?

Don't accuse others of mental illness and start shouting profanitie.

Scroll back up to my original comment.

The first three words are literally ""It happened off-screen"".

What do you mean ""how did he get separated from the three boys""?

He was never ""with"" them, he was in an entirely different unit.

After they arrived on the beach, he and his unit went their own ways, got in a ship off-screen, and then got torpedoed off-screen, and the ship capsized off-screen.

How hard is that to understand?",6ol0kp
dkpeshh,"Well, that's like your opinion man.  And you missed my point entirely, not the other way around.  You implied that giving a tiny amount of background about a character would make him my best friend.  That's a poor analogy.  Because you failed to provide a better one that's my fault?

And by not giving the characters these complicated backgrounds, that makes them blank slates.  People have their individual tastes, I think the politicization of this movie is a great example.  And so by fleshing out characters, you can craft them to be likeable (i.e.  contrived), hateable (also contrived), or somewhere in the middle.  Putting them somewhere in the middle keeps with the realism, but it also means that different member of the audience will have varying emotions when that character dies (some might cheer, others be sad).  

By keeping them a blank slate, you no longer have people projecting onto the characters.  And if you honestly need to feel a connection with someone to care whether or not they live or die, I feel sorry for you. ",6ol0kp

dkm8ukd,"Again, what would you have rather him done, break down and weep?  You claim you wanted him to get into an altercation with Murphy's character when he seemed mature enough to understand that getting mad at that guy wouldn't have solved anything.

To each their own but I thought it was pretty clear that he was distraught.  As someone else has pointed out though, that wasn't even his son.  The guy knew a lot about the different planes and ships, which suggests he probably fought in the first World War and about the perils of war and the possible consequences.

You're taking so much issue over a scene because he didn't break down and sob uncontrollably over a death in the middle of a fucking war.  Sorry, it's just a really fucking dumb thing to nitpick.  He had emotion on his face, you're apparently just upset that he didn't have a complete breakdown when it would have done nothing to further the plot.",6ol0kp
dkq3ohn,"Any more of an ""arc"" would have felt forced. Why can't you care about a character simply because they are a person. As others have said you can make assumptions about his disposition and see what kind of person he is through his actions in the movie. 

This was a unique trait of the movie, not giving the characters these backstories to remind us that soldiers haves families back home (who would have thought??), hopes, dreams, etc. And I personally found it extremely refreshing and cared about these characters pretty much just as much as any traditionally developed characters in movies.",6ol0kp

dknl374,"TDK may or may not be a weaker film - but on what grounds is more to the point

as for memorability - TDK was a huge phenomenon when it came out. the same cannot be said for dunkirk.

dunkirk is a fine film which is beinq well-received but it's praise and good press do not even approach the level of hysteria surrounding TDK when it came out

TDK is a pop culture film and has been talked about continuously since it's release

so you're wrong. its not even a contest",6ol0kp

dkk1zz2,"I'm not saying every movie deserves a pass on the back of director vision not meeting viewer expectation. 

I just think Dunkirk is the rare kind of film where character development and plot aren't necessary to what the movie was trying to do. 

We weren't supposed to go to the theaters to see characters on screen, grow to love them, and then desperately hope they survive their plight. I believe Nolan was banking on our empathy for our fellow man in seeing 400k men in mortal danger and viewing them as a whole as ""the character"" we are rooting for. In my case thats how I viewed it and that is the way by which I was emotionally invested. 

You laud the technical standpoint and that's really what it comes down to. Dunkirk isn't supposed to be a story. It's supposed to be an experience. The difference between Micheal Bay breaking norms of filmmaking by making CGI fests with horrible plots and wooden acting is distinctly different from a filmmaker making the conscious choice to break narrative norms to create a film that is a straightforward experience. To be a telling of a historical catastrophe through *showing* the events. Rather than have characters emote and react to what is happening. It's not the first of its kind but it is rare. Especially among the war movie genre. Hence this creates this expectation bordering on the point of a *need* for there to be characters to latch onto to have an emotional connection. ",6ol0kp
dkk29nq,"Okay so...what's the problem? 

When I said simplistic I mean minimalist in scope. Not every movie needs to have some grand moral lesson to take away. 

Yes. This movie is about the plight of these soldiers. As I said in another response. Nolan is banking on our empathy for fellow members of the human race to see this enormous group of men in mortal danger with time running out before their lives are lost. 

The experience is in the desperate attempts at survival. Nolan doesn't want us to get choked up when one soldier or another dies. He wants us to feel uneasy and on edge as the soldiers as a whole try to escape deadly situations as they await rescue. 

It's meant to be an experience. Not a war epic rich with characters that we are supposed to love. ",6ol0kp

dkmb2od,"I think the camera work was very effective.  You have to realize that the shots are framed well and there's master shots that would require flying up or going miles away from and shoot it there.  The flying sequences all had to be shot on air for real, so flying another plane up there with attached IMAX cameras and they had to be positioned in a particular way for POV shots to work.  It felt very realistic and I think a lot of the POV shots added to the immersion.  The color grading is as expected to look like how the locations looked during the time of war.  Take a look at Atonement's Dunkirk long take for an example.",6ol0kp
