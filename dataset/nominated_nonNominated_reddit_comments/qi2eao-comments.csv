hiifows,"I loved the small *Verfremdungseffekt* scenes, such as Rosenthaler switching actors ""on stage"" to show time passing, or the ""frozen"" tableaux where the actors are clearly struggling to keep still.

Also, I'm of course glad I saw it in the cinema, but more than once I wished I could freeze the frame to really see and take in everything that was going on. There was just so much visual information that I got overwhelmed sometimes.

EDIT: I don't understand how Anderson could write and direct a whole movie as a love letter to *The New Yorker* and NOT (unless I missed something) include a single example of the correct use of diaereses that they are so famous for (like in the word ""coöperation"").",qi2eao

hik0nw7,"For anyone familiar with French movies from the 50s to 70s, this is an absolute feast of references and homages:

* The opening with the waiter climbing multiple stairs is a direct copy from Jacques Tati's Mon Oncle
* The rebelling children in The Cycling Reporter reminded me of The 500 Blows by Francois Truffaut
* The switches between B&W and color (especially with Zefirelli on the broadcasting tower, when the image turns blue-ish) reminded me of something Jean-Luc Godard would do (e.g. in Le Mepris). There's also a street sign (maybe a coiffeur?) in Revisions to a Manifesto that reads ""Masculin Feminin"", which is the name of a Godard movie.
* The whole style of the café flashback in Revisions of a Manifesto reminded me of Jacques Demy's musical masterpiece The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. In the flashback, the image is widescreen and in very lively colors. Also the story of one of the students getting drafted into military service is probably a direct reference to Cherbourg.
* The final episode felt reminicent of violent French film noirs from the 50s, like those from Jules Dassin.

hiih2x8,"I had never seen a Wes Anderson movie before The French Dispatch, bought a ticket just to see what all the fuss was about.

I was blown away with how beautiful the cinematography was. I’ve since watched a few more Wes Anderson films but I think this is still his best just because the intricate details and carefully assembled sets work really well when you imagine them in the pages of the New Yorker. The dollhouse like care that he assembles every scene with is mirrored perfectly with the meticulously curated words that are used for the articles in the New Yorker.

I think the Rollingstone review said that you have to watch the movie twice to see it once, and while I thought that was a pretentious take after reading it, in rewatching different clips and scenes from the movie I think that was actually an apt observation. Knowing what’s going on let’s you focus on all of the other details that are sprinkled into the film, from the geometry of how the actors are positioned to the rapid fire dialogue. 

I saw some people criticize the fact that the anthology seemed unlinked, but I think it’s best thought of a meditation on loneliness (which, after watching more Wes Anderson, seems to be a recurrent theme for him). From the loneliness of the artist, to the loneliness of the journalist covering the student movement, to the loneliness of the chef (paired with the loneliness of the journalist covering him), all explore them in different ways, somewhat resolving with the community of journalists that The French Dispatch has created, but also with the knowledge that the problem was there before the events of the movie and will exist after the events of the movie.",qi2eao
hihj772,I think Jeffrey Wright will be the latest actor that now gets cast in every one of Wes Anderson's films. His voice delivering those lines just fitted so well. A perfect match.,qi2eao
higr88z,Don't forget Christoph Waltz as ... whoever he was for about 32 seconds.,qi2eao
hihvugu,"Great cast, somewhat emotionally cold, but still charming. The Owen Wilson segment was my favorite, wish the film had smaller articles in between the big ones, or given at least some info on the group of writers.

Technically some of the most brilliant artistry I've seen in a while, the city waking up, the tour of the city, and the third section were just incredible visual highlights. Roebuch Wright, played by Wright, was also one of the better recent Anderson characters.

I'd say it's somewhere in the middle of his filmography and not something I'll watch again, but I'm glad I saw it.",qi2eao
hilqqwo,"Overall I enjoyed it but the stories are a mixed bag. More of my impressions on the individual stories below:

The first story was by far my favorite. Benicio, Lea, Brody and Swinton played their parts perfectly. With the exception of Jeffrey Wright's and Saoirse Ronan's characters in the third story this is the only story where I had an emotional attachment to the characters. Benicio and Lea's chemistry is great. Their relationship and how it is developed is so well done given the time restraint. Brody is fantastic and I loved every bit of his time on screen. Swinton is perfect as always and injects a lot of great  humor. Even the bit parts played by Henry Winkler and others were very amusing. I honestly would have been happy with a feature length version of this story because all the various characters were fascinating, the story was compelling and the story within a story format was done so well. The segment, imo, in the movie where  Wes' style, including the random changes to color, both complimented and enhanced the story instead of overshadowing it. 

The second story really fell flat for me. This is probably the first time I didn't enjoy a Timothée Chalamet performance. Unlike the more natural performances from Frances McDormand or the young french woman who plays his counterpart, it felt like Tim was acting the entire time. The outbursts and confusion that Brody lands so well didn't land the same when Tim was trying to pull it off, imo. And in general I didn't find any of the character motivations or the story in general that interesting. Christoph Waltz's cameo felt pointless. I enjoyed the diner scene but otherwise I was relieved when this segment ended.

The third story was both fascinating and overwhelming. So many highlights like Roebuck Wright, the brief interaction between Roebuck and Albert 'the abacus', the scene between Saoirse Ronan's character and the kid,  the car chase, and the convo between Roebuck and Nescaffier (the film's emotional payoff). However, the events  were so damn rushed. It felt like Wes did a speedrun through an entire film in this one segment so it was difficult to attach to  The Commissaire's  or The Chauffeur's (Norton) motivations. I would have loved a whole feature length subplot with Ronan and the kid's character since their brief relationship was done so well done but oh well. By far the highlight was Jeffrey Wright's fantastic performance. Arguably the best written and acted character in the film and this role immediately became one of my favorite of Wright's performances. I hope he get nominated for awards because I think it was that great. Like someone else mentioned I can totally see him becoming a regalar in Wes' films since he handles his dialogue jut as well as or arguably better than any other of his regulars.",qi2eao

hiiso7d,That shot where Timothy Charlemet and the french girl where arguing about the artist and the he plays a song by them on the jukebox had my jaw dropped I don't think I ever been so entranced by a shot before and I don't really completely know what specifically I found so cool about it.,qi2eao
higvxd0,"The high stakes car chase turning into a foot race, then suddenly returning right back to where the car chase left off might have been the hardest I've laughed in a good long time!

Despite enjoying the film, I was buying into the common complaint thrown at it that (due to the anthology nature) it lacked the emotion of Anderson's previous films. But jeez, that last segment with Roebuck hit me like a goddamn train, proving me quite wrong.

His moment with the chef that he deemed ""too sad"" and his explanation for why he loved the dining experience were honestly beautiful in how it portrayed what it was like being alone in a foreign place (not to mention the extra layers of his homosexuality and race), and finding comfort in the place one might least expect.

There definitely wasn't a bad segment among them (I'd still put the Manifesto one towards the bottom though, personally), but I could see myself returning to that particular story again for that perfect mix of (literal) cartoon humor and bittersweet emotions.",qi2eao

hii0w7b,"If you read long form journalistic magazines, this film is a love letter and parody simultaneously. 

I remember reading a 15 page article in the New Yorker about the cultivation of beans and being incredibly interested despite laughing at the idea beforehand. That sensation of diving into a piece of writing and trusting the writer to tell you a story is perfectly captured in this film. 

The episodic nature of the story obviously matches a magazines structure. But it matches the jarring way you go from Politics to Art to Food with the only connecting thread being that you are the type of reader to enjoy this type of magazine and you trust the magazine and the writers to be interesting.",qi2eao
hiiu7rw,"I’ve liked all of Wes Anderson’s films, but maybe this was a bit too much Wes Anderson. It was fine but I don’t think I have much desire to re-watch it like I do with the rest of his movies.

hih8kev,"Though I have seen her well known earlier work, I was still stunned to see a completely nude Lea Seydoux for a prolonged period of time.",qi2eao
hikcyou,"Just got back from seeing this and I thought it was absolutely delightful but also quite poignant. I thought Jeffrey Wright brought a great melancholy and loneliness to his character and section and his meditations on being a stranger in an adopted country and feeling as though you're never quite at home in either place was very real and relatable to me. For a film that I've heard people criticize for not being able to connect to the characters over and over again, I didn't have that problem. This was a great return to form after the disappointing Isle of Dogs. 

It's also one of Anderson's funnier films! I laughed out loud several times! Adrien Brody kills it comedically in Anderson's films. Owen Wilson gets some good moments too.

Lyna Khoudri (motorcycle helmet girl) really stood out to me. She and Lea Seydoux channel a similar kind of militant attitude that feels reminiscent of the Greta Gerwig character in Isle of Dogs but where that character felt unnecessary in that film, these characters were both funny and forthright and fascinating in equal measure.",qi2eao

hjafxcw,"My favorite part of the film was Benecio painting Lea Seydoux, then she steps aside to get dressed into a guard uniform. Quickly throwing a straight jacket on Benecio as she returns him to his cell. 

I laughed so hard at that, it was so unexpected. Plus I loved their relationship, very odd and quirky. I love how they hissed and growled at each other. 

Also Benecio’s explanation for joining basket weaving and pottery was Oscar worthy, what a great monologue,",qi2eao
hitxy1u,"The sound design is incredible in this film. I'm hard-pressed to remember a time where diegetic sound has been noticeably reflexive. During the Manifesto, the walls fall and the music grows. When JKL walks from her podium, her voice loses reverberance. While the film's sounds bring attention to the process, they remain subtle and hold purpose. Very fun.

As in most Anderson films, the visuals obviously showcase his style via symmetrical framing and low depth of field. The transitions from color to black-and-white were not new (i.e. Grand Budapest Hotel, Isle of Dogs), but still rather well used. It seemed he utilized this method around a rule regarding the future and the past melding with these moments. However, the scene with Lt. Nescaffier walking up the staircase used color, and thus seemed jarring. The use of color lacked purpose with no real color to be highlighted with the choice. If it remained black-and-white, the geometry of the frame could have been more fleshed out. Reminded me of the staircase scene in Andrejz Wajda's ""A Generation"".

I think my favorite part of the film was Anderson's decisions to break his style several times throughout the film. Each time was unique to its moment, and held impact amidst the established methods of the director. Simone's asymmetrical profile was beautiful. The handheld shot of Krementz interrupting Zeffirelli and Juliette was dramatic. The taxi cab shared by Zeffirelli's parents felt unlike any sequence he's done before. 

Intensely funny that these new choices seem remarkable, but are not particulary innovative amidst film history as a whole. Kudos to Anderson's long-time cinematographer Robert Yeoman. I believe he deserves just as much credit as Anderson for this film, and the films it succeeds.

I walked away with the same feeling I have every time I see a new Wes Anderson: this is better than the last. While some might argue his style is repetitive (beginning to lack creativity), I can't help but feel he's one of the best filmmakers this century. Very few artists create material that consistently improves, and trumps his/her previous endeavors. 

No one can achieve this style quite like Anderson and Yeoman. I deeply admire their desire to perfect it. 

Great movie.",qi2eao
hihvx7q,"Absolutely loved it. I can understand the critique about it not having the same emotional resonance as The Grand Budapest or Moonrise Kingdom but that's not what it was supposed to be.

One thing I loved that I haven't seen anyone comment on is the switching back and forth between black and white and then quick flashes of the same scene in full color. I am guessing this was to simulate the photos in the magazine?",qi2eao
hih04h9,"Oh man, I can't believe I've finally seen this movie after being hyped about it for so long and being disappointed over its multitude of delays. I enjoyed it A LOT. It's a quintessential Wes Anderson film, and if you're his fan, you'd likely love this movie as well. Wes has always been one of my favorite directors due to his quirky creative story-telling; this movie showcases that. My favorite of the three stories was the last one -- the cartoon part cracked me up! The French Dispatch being inspired by The New Yorker inspired me to subscribe to their magazine after I got home from the movie. I can't wait to dive into all these long-reads.",qi2eao
hj3tklw,Wes Anderson at his most masturbatory.,qi2eao
himctj6,"Anyone else notice towards the end of the Manifestó storyline (where the helmet girl was yelling at the older woman and the rebel leader boy) that Anderson switched over, very briefly, to a more handheld/unsteady hand cam shooting style rather than his signature straight and symmetrical style?",qi2eao
hikxfqi,"I absolutely loved it. What some people see as a negative (the shorter stories and vignettes leading to less emotionally satisfying stories) is actually what really drew me into the film. By limiting himself to smaller stories and sketches of characters, I felt like Wes Anderson really made the most of all his usual tropes, like the brief flashes of colour that were absolutely jolting, or the sudden moments of melancholy and sadness in the middle of what seemed like fairly silly or frivolous ideas.

The cycling tour was amazingly fast paced and inventive, but the story of the painter and his muse was the highlight of the film in my opinion. It just struck the right chord of hilarious, dark, and genuinely sweet (especially Moses introducing himself to the class). I thought it was up there with the best things Wes Anderson has ever done.

My only complaint would be that it peaked a little early. The manifesto story ended on a strong note, but was the least engrossing part of the film IMO. Jeffrey Wright was incredible in the final segment, and I thought his exchange in the prison cell with Murray was lovely, but I thought that segment went on a bit long and got a bit too kitsch (the animation was maybe a step too much for me). But then the film ends with that beautiful epilogue and all was forgiven.

I think I might go as far as to say this is my second favourite Anderson film after The Royal Tenenbaums. It might change based on a second viewing, but I think I even liked this slightly more than Grand Budapest Hotel.",qi2eao
hij64k4,"I think it's Anderson's most visually beautiful by far, no contest when stacked against the others. See this on the biggest screen you can find - the level of detail in the design is unreal. 

I think it's also Anderson's most boring and narratively uninteresting movie by far, no contest. Having everything feel so disconnected and having the middle story segment as the weakest (in my opinion) made the movie feel like a crawl for me. By the time it got to the middle of the chef/chief story, I felt like 2 and a half hours had passed. 

As a whole, it was a fun experience, but not one I'll be anxious to repeat aside from looking at some stills or rewatching small sequences.",qi2eao
hipct7i,"Honestly ? I'm massively disappointed. 

Visually, it's Wes Anderson, you know what you're gonna get and you get it. There are no surprises, no disappointment in this aspect, it's all very solid and carefully crafted which is always refreshing even though I must admit, it does get a bit tiring and repetitive. 

The main issue is the story and how the concept itself drags the movie down. It's bold and a fun idea but in the end it doesn't work, it's just a collection of random short movies about random characters that we can't really get attached to or get invested in, the stories feel superficial yet extremely dragged out and because we keep changing, the movie feels insanely long and in the end, completely whatever. I just did not care for any of it, I didn't mind any of it either, it just felt so pointless and meaningless, almost vapid. The quirky aspect to it doesn't work and is actually pretty annoying because for that to work, the movie *has* to be funny or endearing in some way and TFD feels lifeless and extremely dry. It fails on every aspect The Grand Budapest Hotel so incredibly succeeds at. 

Kinda felt like it was just W.A. flexing his directing muscles and going all out but nothing more. I honestly got bored. 

Some stuff also really felt weird, I'm french and it's just incredibly weird to hear and see english everywhere when we're supposed to be located in a tiny french village. Why is Timothée Chalamet speaking english when everyone else is speaking french (even his parents !) ? Why is there English written everywhere in Ennui ? Idk it just doesn't make sense. Feels weird. Super cool to see some french actors we know so well interact with the likes of Frances McDormand and Jeffrey Wright though.

Anyways, kinda ironic that everything takes place in Ennui-sur-Blasé because that's exactly what I was during The French Dispatch.",qi2eao
hio0tvs,"While I appreciated this love letter to journalists as a journalist myself, my god this was such a Wes Anderson flex show. Not in a good way. I was just so distracted by the shots that my mind had to play catch up with the story. 

What kept racing through my mind is SNL's parody of Wes Anderson and how absolutely spot on it was with this movie in particular.",qi2eao
hihkq5b,"I really don't know how I feel about it. I saw it the other night and just sort of felt a bit empty after it. Grand Budapest Hotel is one of my favourite films, and I love most of his other work, but I felt this just didn't have much heart. 

The first and last stories were the better of the 3, but a lot of it felt 'artsy' for the sake of being artsy. I'm not quite sure if I got why certain shots were in colour Vs black and white while in the same story, just seemed a bit jarring to me.

That said I was never bored when watching it, and it was engrossing and engaging. It just lacks something.

Also was a bit ruined as they got the framing wrong in my cinema, so half the subtitles were missing.",qi2eao
hir7qhx,"While I agree with what others have said about the spectacle, the density, pace and overall film craft on display being some of the highest level of Wes’s career. What really knocked this several points for me was the lackluster connection between the stories toying an emotional and thematic theoughline. I felt that it just didn’t have a heart and typically Wes Anderson movies have a huge heart, that cuts deep through the entire movie. 

He’s no stranger to making abridged experiences feel weight-ful. But this movie moved so quickly none of the characters could breath. I’m disappointed and was expecting more. I’ll have to see it again to figure out where it ends up on my list. But definitely not near the top.",qi2eao
hknux11,Can't tell you a single characters name. ADHD The Movie.,qi2eao
hignwu1,"I feel there was an idea going around when this movie and cast was announced. That perhaps we had reached a Wes Anderson singularity, maybe Wes Anderson is now so Wes Anderson that it stops being unique and starts being tiring. And I was a little bit preparing myself to feel that way after seeing this. 

And I have to say, after the movie was over I just felt stupid for doubting this man. After he created such a unique style and stuck to it while giving us so many different stories and emotional moments, to think he'd lost it was silly. The French Dispatch is great, among his best I think. Maybe it's where some may get off the Anderson train because his style is so specific, but for me it just showed me how much he still has up his sleeve. 

**The sets.** I mean it's no secret he's got the best production design in the game, but these sets. Holy shit. The way they moved, the way windows would open or dogs would cross the street or someone would light a pipe. The movie was constantly moving in that way. Never boring. I can only imagine how many shots are in this movie. It seemed like they spent a week perfecting the look of a shot just to show it for three seconds. The meticulous way he plans these shots out and how they end up moving together is so, so impressive. 

Then you have the stories. All very interesting in their own way. I'm not even sure which I liked the most because they were all so nice. We have a man who makes good movies so consistently, and whereas some may start to run out of ideas it seems like Anderson is so over flowing with concepts that he has to frame a story three times, write a stage version of it, and make four vignettes just the get them all out. How he even outlined this movie is insane to think about. 

The performances are wonderful. Obviously this whole movie moves and feels like a Wes Anderson movie.  But when the performances call for nuance everyone shows up for it. When Frances is called an old maid by the young French girl. When the kidnapped boy talks to Ronan and she sings to him. When Jeffrey Wright has to explain why he was locked up. When Simone quits her job at the jail. The final scene. This movie is so full of moments that could have been the singular climax of any other perfectly good movie. 

Obviously, I loved this. Anderson continues to impress me. To be what he is yet keep it fresh for literal decades now. To even imagine a movie this complex and how it came to be just shows how much he has to give us and I, for one, will hopefully never doubt him again. 9/10.

hiib78t,"Classic Wes Anderson film that I feel was slightly let down by its characterisation. I didn't really feel for any of the writers and most of the characters in the vignettes.

I'm a huge long-time fan, and it was really disappointing to be sitting there hating the movie so much.  Glad that I appear to be in the minority, but I was just bored the whole time.  I always like his style and the quirkyness, but there wasn't enough story there for me to hang on.",qi2eao
hikr92b,"I liked it a lot, and felt like it was a step up from isle of dogs, though not in his top tier of movies. 

I didn’t really see it as just a movie about how awesome fancy writers are at writing writey things — to me, it was more broadly about how groups of people form meaningful emotional/familial connections through organizations in the context of metropolitan sprawl, which from one POV can seem alienating and ersatz, but, from another POV seems like a beautiful expression of the human spirit and our desire to belong (I guess the chef basically says as much in that ending scene, so I might be restating the obvious. Still.) and this spirit exists regardless of whether writers for the French dispatch are there to document it in such a manner, though it serves as the most prominent symbolic representation and expression of it. And,
i think it speaks to Anderson’s romantic notions of purposely constructing meaning and beauty from what could otherwise be meaningless and ugly, and how there is beauty in the pursuit, beauty in the assertion that WE ARE NOT SLEEPY, even if in the end that order breaks back down into the churn of an ever changing city.",qi2eao
hiubi2o,"I think Anderson's vague time fictional time framing kind of hurt the movie. You know it starts well with Wilson's character actually introducing the town of Ennui. So the town should be a character as well. But each story just has this detachment to one another and lacks linearity. You should see each story connect or reference one another as part of the larger narrative of the history of the town.

Because journalism doesn't exist in a vacuum nor is it completely neutral, it is very much about the journalists reporting on their time and their society. And the Revisions to a Manifesto story is where this problem is most evident as it is inspired by the student protests in France in the 60s. But Anderson avoids any politics in the narrative and has his event be jokingly referred to as students being grumpy. It seems more mocking of the students and their ideals. No one is good or bad, it's all just quirky and silly. And I think the protests were more about girls dorms rather than socialism or capitalism or something. Might have missed it because the dialogue can be pretty fast.

But I think the artifice of Anderson has gotten a bit too much where nothing feels real or genuine, it looks pretty and each actor has their quirks and funny moments but it doesn't have anything to say",qi2eao

That said the movie was a _struggle_ for me, particularly the second segment with its convoluted structure. At a certain point, it simply ran out of gas. I was basically counting until the last part. 

The third segment really grounded the movie for me (animated sequence aside).

The Concrete Masterpiece kept me engaged with interesting and animated characters (nice to see Adrien Brody having fun).

The Police Commissioner segment was very dull apart from the car chase and I kept wanting it to end to move onto the next segment.

hkneaz6,"Wow... this was disappointing, atrocious honestly. This film was a self-indulgent, obscure mess, patronising the audience at any moment it could find; following the formula of an incredibly convoluted barely decipherable soliloquy being delivered for the sole intent of saying ""Haha, that wasn't meant to be understood, you're confused aren't you?"" . I never walk out of films, and I would have for the 1st time from this one if it wouldn't take more effort to leave a full cinema then subject myself to watching it any further.

An incoherent string of scenes, moments, littered with obscure references not intended to be understood by your typical patron. It was practically a parody of a Wes Anderson film. Just artistic vomit, with no sense of reeling it in - akin to a first film from an auteur, when they're trying to find their style and voice, slowly refining it as they develop.

Laughing at the absurdity of the film, and the mess it is, gets old really quickly; it's simply not enough to sustain your interest. Why would anyone care what's happening to the characters and going on screen. I'm pretty sure because this film was so obscure, incoherent, at times incomprehensible, critics will be eating it up, projecting their own interpretations, trying to portray it as some sort of masterpiece, in case it is, and they're made out to look like uncultured fools. And if that's the irony Wes was trying to go for, reflected in the painter story, its a pretty clever self-aware joke.

There was no point to the film, not even an attempt to make any point rather. Actors (Del Toro, Mcdermott) did the best they could with the pretentious out-of-touch script. If each frame of this movie were put into an art gallery, I'd visit it - and that's all the film had going for it.

I don't think I could watch another WA film after the level of contempt he showed towards his audience and fans with this film.",qi2eao
hiplpcm,"I'm a huge Wes Anderson fan.. and you definitely have to be an Anderson fan to really appreciate it. I thought it was great but I can see why some people would dislike it.

I thought the production design and cinematography is probably the best Anderson ever did, every shot was incredible. The black and white parts were definitely a highlight. Loved the score too by Alexandre Desplat.

I thought the anthology style also worked really well with this movie and definitely felt different from other Anderson films. (#1 being my personal favorite, but they were all good.) With all these franchise movies recently, it just feels good to see something really original.",qi2eao
hkdqeod,"That was the most disappointing Wes Anderson movie I've ever seen. I just can't anymore with him. He's growing real stale and hollow. All style and ZERO substance. Perfect composition and idiosyncratic characters with flat emotions and no story don't make a good film. He's a great director but he has no concept of feeling, relationships, or rising action. The movie was pompous trite. What a bore.",qi2eao

higsqgf,"I’ve rolled my eyes a few times at the reviews I’ve been reading about this for a couple of weeks, tired of hearing how this movie “is a love letter to a past age of journalism.” But dammit, they’re absolutely right, and you can feel the heart and care. Coming out of the theater, I realized I was feeling intense nostalgia for a bygone era of journalism and storytelling, one I never lived through but that I got a small window into because of this movie. It made me appreciate it a lot.

The movie itself can vary wildly. Sometimes super charming and entertaining, other times a bit boring and emotionally distant, I found myself liking a couple of stories a lot more than others. As this is my first Wes Anderson film, I finally got to see for myself this style that so many talk about, and I can now realize how it works so well in its beauty and charm (seriously, these sets, props, and camerawork are nearly unmatched), but can create a barrier between us and the characters. They become props themselves rather than human beings. The only time I felt genuine emotion (other than the aforementioned nostalgia) was at the end of old Timothy’s story; that one is just superb.

Long ass comment, but I’ll end with this: movies like this make me appreciate film as a medium so much, and appreciate the opportunity to see this opening night in a room packed full of others who love movies just as much as I do. What an incredibly lovely night",qi2eao
hihnzxx,"I feel like I’m takin crazy pills reading these comments. I thought it was absolutely awful. Nonsensical overindulgent and pointless.

Felt like everyone showed up for thirty seconds and he was just running too wild with his style",qi2eao
hojjzgs,"So, am I the only one who hated this. Was it not extremely boring?",qi2eao
hpyhyc4,"I think why it speaks to me, but turned many off, are 2 reasons:

1. It's Black and White. No offense; black and white always give a depressed feeling -- and especially with the numerous restriction/lockdown these past 2 years, we need something to lift us up, and both the style and the settings (enclosed prison; student dorms and police suppression; a dark winter night) doesn't help
2. The plot is secondary; a vehicle to the theme and sensation of being a lonely outsider. As an immigrant, the third section completely speaks well, and pretty much explain what this movie is about. Quite frequently, you may get close to your adopted country, and you can see it, feel it, taste it, touch it -- but always a distance. And this distance is not something comfortable -- it never goes away; just something you live with. And I am certain most audience here never have to experience being a foreign resident or an immigrant for an extended period, where people care more about your accent and looks then the rest of your substance.

That discomfort you all feel - in the movie but still apart? It's the same feelings of many immigrants experienced, especially those who differ from its local majority race.",qi2eao

Just the whole story about losing a great mentor and them paying tribute, it made me tear up (no crying, I know). But this had some of Wes' best shots ever, and I think that's saying something. 

My favorite has to be the switching between Tony Revolori to Del Toro was incredible, so simple but so effective. This young, extremely bright kid with the future ahead of him, to grizzled, worn down close to death old man. 

Also the fact that WA has decided that every chase scene he does is now going to be animated makes me very happy. 

And lastly, I think I could watch a solid movie of just people breaking into rooms directed by WA.",qi2eao

hk27sml,"I finally saw it last night. One of the most beautiful films I ever seen(not hyperbole). Anderson played with aspect ratio in his past couple films, he mastered it with this one.

After 1 single viewing The French Dispatch may have surpassed it",qi2eao
hii0zsq,"After leaving *The French Dispatch*, my husband said that it reminded him of *Mank*: a technically remarkable film but no strong emotional hook. I have to agree. I've enjoyed Wes Anderson films and all their stylized quirkiness, but this one felt overly indulgent. I think that the anthology format made it difficult for me to connect with any of the characters; by the time I'd settled into a story, we were moving on to the next one. At times, the pacing felt almost manic, and not in a fun zany way. There's no denying that Anderson's talent for set design and world building is on display here, but to what end? Not every movie needs a larger ""point"" or ""purpose,"" but having some thesis other than ""I love the New Yorker"" would have made the movie more resonant. The glimmers of deeper emotion from the third story in particular made me wish that the movie had just expanded upon that storyline. Overall, I think more focus would have made for a more meaningful movie experience.",qi2eao
hihfoob,"Just came out. Absolutely brilliant. One of the best I’ve seen this year so far. I knew what I was walking into, with it being Wes and all, but a lot of people are saying it’s not emotionally engaging enough. I could see why but I felt like I walked away feeling extremely satisfied emotionally. It’s quirky and sweet and very stylistic, it’s like 3 Wes short films in one. There’s a sprinkle of romance in each story. Maybe the characters weren’t fully dissected but it’s perfect for this anthology style format, especially with 12+ top tier actors of the medium starring. I also never got bored with it, it is so beautiful just looking at each and every scene and the details that go into it. With that being said, the movie definitely isn’t for everyone so that’s fair. 

There was a couple of jarring bits like in the first story, the wonky special effects in the prison fight scene or in the last story with the stop motion destruction of the walls/barriers. Honestly I liked how he chose to add that, just to make the fights more animated (pun intended) because that’s just his style at this point. The cinematography and editing is god-tier of course, but this is like a film school brat’s dream movie, I could definitely see a course examining this (along with his other work) in the future.",qi2eao

hih7anf,"Not his best. Not his worst. Perfectly average. 

I felt the first segment was the strongest and most fully formed of the three stories. It also didn't have any of the weird gimmicky stuff like the abrupt stage play or the animated sequences. As the movie went on, it also started to feel like an excuse for Wes to show off how many actors want to work with him (Christoph Waltz, Saorise Ronan, Willem Dafoe are all basically cameos).

I still had a good time, but it's uneven like almost every anthology film is.",qi2eao
hil10u3,"I feel like one of the main themes in the movie was “the future” making way for whats to come. It dealt a lot with an admiration for a certain craft.

Like the painting or certain people, it shows that this will lead to a brighter and more colorful future.

I really don't mind Wes Anderson movies.  Bottle Rocket is a near perfect film, and the Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of the best movies I've seen in the past 20 years, but this movie is pointless, emotionless wanking by a director who has such a locked-in style that, for whatever reason, he seems less and less comfortable straying away from.   He's just going to continually get away with this stuff because he's loved and people love his movies.

Bill Murray's character could have been the most interesting of them all but his presence and brief and his >!death!< is a mere footnote that they spent a bit of time in beginning building up to.   Isn't he the central character in all of this?  I wish he was.

The whole movie is a love letter to a world gone by and he created a film that we never see anymore.  No real plot, just beauty from words to visuals.

To have an already disjointed story separated into parts with the inconsistent style throughout, which often changed for no apparent reason (changing from colour to b&w? Why?). Just a very inconsistent movie that was more of an experimental art piece gone wrong. The only story I liked was the one with the artist in the prison.",qi2eao

No,kidding. A Wes Anderson movie, obviously! This movie is BEAUTIFUL to look at. Seriously I think this might be Anderson's most technically impressive movie. Loved the different sets, the creativity of how it was filmed. The use of colour, the changes of aspect ratio. The dude is fucking FLEXING in this thing from a filmmaking perspective. There's so much going on visually at times it's hard to take it all in and I'm thankful I saw it on the big screen. I want to see a behind the scenes on some of the shots.

Structurally I really liked the magazine mechanic of the film. Having an anthology type movie with the common theme being stories from the 'French Dispatch' is cool, and very Wes Andersony. And although this feels like he's still kind of memeing him self at this point, it also feels like he was trying something new in a lot of ways.

Really liked the first story thought it was a good blend of humour and poignant moments that Anderson is known for. Really cemented my love for Lea Seydoux ...Holy moly. Adrian Brody was great too as was Benecio. AND Tilda, really everyone jived great.

The problem is with the last two stories. While again, technically impressive, I felt these stories were all over the place. Too convoluted. Had moments of greatness, but the weaknesses are deeper and had me checking my watch at times. Really wanted to love them, but the last two thirds of really made me like the movie less. Still was in awe of a lot of things, the animated scene in particular, the use of colour, Lyna Khoudri really stood out. But yeah, such a bummer too because I was really thinking this was a huge return to form for ol'andy after Isle of Dogs was kind of meh. It's still better than that one though, I just think it could have been even better.

All the dialogue is super complex for absolutely no reason, all the shots are aligned and centered and super picturesque, there were a lot of big words and sentences pieced together that nobody would say in real life. I will say, once it got to the food short I understood it more and it made me a bit emotional, but over all this movie does not do a very good job (imo) establishing what it is supposed to be. I would also like to say that I did not necessarily care for Bill Murray's character at all. I knew what his role was supposed to be, or if I was supposed to care for him at all, but there were just way too many characters and too much going on for me to even care.

I personally didn't care for the second story, it just fell flat for me. I don't think Chalamet has the acting strength needed to pull off this role and make it endearing. The concept was interesting but read as pretentious. Two well-read, French teenagers having sex won't bring peace to the world, much less their town, much less heal the rift between the younger and older generations.

Benicio del Toro's piece up top was very engaging, along with Owen Wilson's intro that laid the scene. The third story might have been my favorite, however, I also felt like Murray's character towards the end. Wright's incredible narration about food and the shots within were so engaging, I wanted *more* of that, maybe a piece strung together with more food/drink.

Second, I've realized that some people don't like it. Some of my highschool friends said it's BS and they told the same about The Budapest Hotel. They watch movies and read books a lot, but they hate things like this or books like 100 years of solidity. It's okay because it doesn't harm anyone. And I do not want to act like a high class reader or watcher. I just wanna say that it'd be great if people can be more patient about art.

It's not as as poignant as Grand Budapest Hotel, but it has a whimsical melancholy that encapsulates the loneliness of the artist, whether they be a painter, a writer, or a cook - and that they are driven to success not because they want to succeed, but because they are afraid of being a disappointment.

So much of that has to do with the music choices and Alexandre Desplat's scores, which really elevate the art form.

hjliwaw,"Wes Anderson, you really are a mad genius.

The French Dispatch, arguably the most typical Wes Anderson film he's ever made alongside The Grand Budapest Hotel, is a lovely tribute to journalism. Structured in an anthology-ish type, the film tells four stories spread in a wide array of characters including an prisoned artist, a chess prodigy, and the titular French Dispatch columnist.

The wide array of characters in these stories are brought with greatness thanks to the excellent ensemble cast (with previous collaborators and other actors), while being technically marvellous (especially in aesthetics and production design).

The French Dispatch may not be as good as Anderson's other films, but it's one of the best of this year.",qi2eao
hjn63in,"I really enjoyed this movie! Right after it ended I had mixed feelings, but the more I think about it the more I appreciate it. Definitely going to watch it again. One of my thoughts about this movie that has been confirmed here, is how it touches on journalism and story telling. In the beginning each writer is introduced and it's stated that no one's story is being cut from the issue. It's interesting to see which story each journalist chose to cover and how they all differ from the next. Also the town name being ""Ennui"" meaning listlessness and disatisfaction adds another layer. There was definitely a dark theme that didn't shy away from death and the macabre",qi2eao
hju8xz4,"This was the first Wed Anderson film I've actually seen all the way through properly, and in cinema and I absolutely loved it. He has this unique style to other big time directors which I'm sure people here are well aware of but it was such a treat to sit through. I loved how he combined his use of direct directing with almost a play/stage like cinematography. The witty script and voice over mixed with the way he uses characters on the screen to tell a story makes it so easy to get invested into every little thing going on, and there Is a lot to take in.

Visually as well with say the start of the film with the waiter, the Paris City tour or the prison riot scenes or the ironic ""freeze frames"", there's a lot to take in and I agree that it may be worth watching again for that alone. The stories were told and portrayed brilliantly without being ""too short"" or ""too long"" for each. Granted I wish Owen Wilson had a little more there but I'm not exactly mad he hadn't. I feel like every cast member had a nice little balance in performance for what they were casted for, bar Waltz who was a bit random, but considering how many notable actors were in the film, it didn't feel like it was overwhelmed or saturated. If anything this film has made me want to watch more Wes Anderson films. Also as a side note, strong Netflix ""A series of unfortunate events"" vibes with how it was shot and narrated in some scenes.",qi2eao

hr09263,"I liked this film for what it was, a collection of vignettes (and as an art historian/curator, the first one was perfect to me). I also wondered if in that first vignette there was something of Wes Anderson's own feelings about fame, artistic production, and patronage: the pressure to produce, and the anxiety over whether it's liked or not, and feeling constrained by the expectations... all of that said, I do miss his earlier movies which felt more emotional and 'real' to me, especially The Royal Tenenbaums and The Darjeeling Limited.

hixui40,"This movie felt like the best execution of Wes Anderson's already quirky cinematography. A bunch of shots felt like moving art pieces, and the overall presentation felt like the best possible execution of its multiple-story premise. The three stories and its framing device were undeniably his style while still feeling distinct.

As for the stories themselves, I felt the first and third stories were both stronger than the second. Rosenthaler's story felt like it could have been a movie all its own, and I liked the plot and characters of Wright's story. I liked Timothee's performance, but the story he was in felt confusing at times and uninteresting in others. The acting was on point for every character, especially from Tilda Swinton and Benicio Del Toro. 

Overall I'd call this Anderson's second-best movie, with Grand Budapest Hotel still being his best in my opinion. I'd really recommend it if you liked that, and even then if you want to see a French-inspired artsy film that doesn't take itself too seriously.",qi2eao

hj8bg9x,"Got to see this early at the NYFF and was excited for everyone to see it, but then felt like it got (understandably) overshadowed by Dune.

I really loved it! It was never going to match the emotional heights of Budapest or his other best works because it really is just a short story collection, with the various sections connected by little else than the film’s structure. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed all three (and the odds and ends) and think the movie as a whole is easily Wes’ most visually inventive (and possibly his funniest). I really enjoyed it as a separate thing from his other movies and was able to appreciate it on its own (still relentlessly creative and stylish) terms.

Particularly enjoyed the moving tableaus with everyone frozen in Part 1, Timothee talking back and forth between Frances and the young woman in Part 2, and the car chase in Part 3. And the wheelchair fight in Part 1 is an instant S-tier Wes scene",qi2eao
hjcm63a,"A disclaimer that this was my first time seeing a Wes Anderson film, so I wasn't familiar with his style prior to today. Overall I found the film underwhelming. The anthology style meant that just as you got into one segment it moved on to the next, making it hard to get into anything. I also found a couple of bits to be in poor taste - the criminal in the Concrete Masterpiece being Jewish (I'm Jewish) and where they aluded to a character committing suicide, also in the same segment I think. And where there were English subtitles, they sometimes went by too quickly to properly take them in. 

In terms of what I did enjoy, the Revisions to a Manifesto was easily my favourite segment. i I also thought Timothee Chalamet was the standout actor of the whole film (and no I wasn't previously a die hard fan of his).",qi2eao
hjeuij7,"I wish I knew french for this movie lol. So many times I was trying to appreciate a great scene, but kept having to flick up/down for the subtitles.

I loved the comedy in this movie, not overly forced but still genuinely hilarious. That car chase turning to a foot chase and then ending with them returning back to the cars was brilliant. 

One thing I was a bit confused on Zeffirelli’s death. Did he get electrocuted at the top of the tower? How did he end up drowning? Maybe I’m just missing something. 

Overall really enjoyed it and I especially loved how it went back and forth between B&W and color. Could’ve been annoying or pretentiously artsy but I thought it was perfect. It added clarity to certain stories and just looked great in other moments. When the kid is locked up and it cuts to looking through that slit and seeing the woman’s eyes in color was such an interesting moment.",qi2eao

Went in trying to prepare myself for what I’d heard was a quirky style and it still came across as weird/off-putting, at least at first.

For a 1hr40min film, it packs in 4 stories, which feel pretty rushed, it lacked the emotional depth of Tenenbaums/Darjeeling/Moonrise. 
Isle of Dogs took me another viewing to come around to it, hoping that's the case with this one. Chalamet was good.

hkipvk7,"I really wish that we got to see beyond Bill Murray's character of just an editor with a keen eye for talented writers. What was his story beyond the cold narration of his past? Why was he so driven to seek out these writers? I feel like if we would have explored the heart of his character, and tied it into each story, ie reasons he chose to publish them, then at the end when he's dead, I would have felt emotionally connected to all the writers, and empathized more with their loss. As it stands now, I felt disconnected, drowned by the quick, elaborate dialogue, and was waiting for it to be over 45 minutes in. 5/10",qi2eao
hklmu1f,"Right off the bat, there's just no way this could contend for his best work IMO because the anthology format is less ambitious (contrary to the cast being the most Wes Anderson-y Wes Anderson ensemble ever) than the likes of his other recent works, but that's perfectly okay. 

Coincidentally and fortunately, I saw this as a dine-in theater with reclining seats and it was the perfect complement for that kind of vibe; felt like I was at home, cozy, watching a TV special on a streaming service during winter break. If I had gone to a more mainstream theater and was more in a blockbuster mood, I probably would've been a tad bit disappointed. Admittedly, after I found out this was coming out on home media next month, I told my friend I'd much rather see The Last Duel in theaters because this is way more fit for at-home pausing and appreciating every little frame. Alas, TLD unfortunately bombed so hard I couldn't even find a single screening nearby.

Definitely need to re-watch this with subtitles though, I was pretty confused as to what was going on during various parts of the film. It's been so long since I've watched something outside of home without subtitles, and the dialogue in WA movies aren't exactly the easiest to catch. The projectionist or whatever at our theater messed up too and the full aspect ratio wasn't shown, so even when there were subtitles when characters were speaking French, they were half cut off screen.

Some of his stylistic techniques were encroaching onto confusing and polarizing territory too. Rosenthaler's character aging represented by explicitly switching the actor on-screen was weird because the 2 actors (Tony Revolori and Benicio del Toro) look nothing alike. The constant color and lighting change for the same scene was a bit discombobulating too, but I think that's something I'll be able to appreciate on rewatch. On the other hand, loved the constant camera angle change between Benicio and Léa Seydoux during their conversation staring at the ceiling and pretty much the rest of the signature WA stuff. 

Overall, think The Concrete Masterpiece was the best story. Was delighted to see (another) Asian actor join WA's ensemble with a notable in The Private Dining Room of the Police Commissioner though, and he was pretty much the MVP of that story. Other than perhaps the wrestler who did so much and absolutely nothing at the same time, lmao. The switch to the French style animation was really cool and very on point for WA but still couldn't elude the reaction from both me and my friend that it was conspicuously done to avoid the budget restraints of filming explosions and the like in live-action, lol.  


My friend and I also joked about how quick Edward Norton got killed off; got a bit excited when we recognized his voice on the phone before he was actually introduced but in the end it seemed like his voice lasted longer than his actual screen presence. This one actually had a pretty high kill count for a Wes Anderson movie too??

Definitely some standout performances here (Jeffrey Wright, Benicio, Brody, etc.) but this is the first time I've watched a WA flick and actively felt overall the cast are stilted and such because they aren't used to acting in the style of his movies? Whether it was an obvious waiting for their cue; Lea having to juggle walking towards the camera and back, staring straight forward and not making eye-contact with the camera right up in her face, and reciting her lines in that one shot; or anything else. Who knows, maybe I'm just hypersensitive in that department because this is my first movie outing in a long while.  

I was distracted during the first part of the movie with Owen Wilson because I arrived late and was messing about with my snacks but that frame with the cats all around the city is probably the one that has remained most vividly in my memory, soo picturesque. 

I think a key part of an anthology is being able to wrap up the individual stories together poetically and the end was probably the worst part because it failed to do this. Them just all being reporters for the same publication and meeting up in the end because the head honcho passed away just felt like a completely technical way to connect everything but not in any way emotionally compelling. 

Overall, enjoyed it and can't wait to re-watch and for Asteroid City. Feels good to know his next one has long since been in production before we even got to see this one.",qi2eao

hsc0myd,"I know i'm a bit late to the discussion but i would like to raise my opinion anyways. 

I liked the movie, beautiful, funny, sad and interesting, there is no one word to describe the adventure that Anderson provides audiences with this movie. For the accustomed Wes Anderson viewer, this is really nothing new, the picturesque settings is just as familiar as Bill Murray at this point, but for the casual movie-watcher, not yet used to Anderssons special style of cinematography, this movie really confuses the h\*ll of the viewer.

My primary opinion of the movie is positive. The movie constantly asks both philosophical and poetic questions that the viewer throughout  has to ponder over and about. (this is most prominent in the second story featuring the charming and talented actor Timothée Chalamet). The score is a small step down from the flawless soundtrack featured in Anderson's previous film ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"", but it still captures supports both the acting and the script. Another thing that makes the movie great is the acting, where the best performances come from Adrian Brody, Timothée Chalamet and Benicio del Toro.

The biggest flaw that i feel the movie has is the pacing. While'st fast pacing is an artistic expression that defines Wes Andersons movie, it is easy to get lost in the disposition presented, this is most prominent in the last story titled ""The Private Dining Room of the Police Commissioner"", here the viewer is presented with lots of information in a short but fast paced montage, without time to truly understand and register the disposition. The second flaw that i feel with the movie is that the characters feel two-dimensional and unreal. This is a negative trope that haunts Anderson, not being able to write truly engaging, and three-dimensional characters. Same with the script, none of the stories presented truly engages the viewer, it only offers as entertainment. This i feel is a common theme in Anderson's movies, which often lack engaging stories or rememberable plots. 

As a conclusion i would recommend every cinephile to watch this truly amazing movie, but do be aware that this is not a story which will  guarantee emotional affection.",qi2eao

ix6pjam,"My wife and I watched this over 2 nights (kids interrupted the 1st night).

I genuinely loved the first several parts of the movie. Very. Wes. Anderson. And that's a good thing.

But the last segment... was a hot mess. Switching back and forth between live action and animated was very unsettling. And it wasn't the good kind of animation, like in Life Aquatic. It was the bad kind of animation, where it looks like the characters are bobbleheads and where every little bit of every frame is distracting from the story that the narrator is *trying* to tell - but the narrator sounds bored being there, so I can't even follow what is being said. And then because I'm distracted by the nonsense on the screen.... bleh.

The first two thirds of the film get an AAA+++. But that last segment... D- and because of that, I never want to see this movie again.

From the Film Noir of the 50s to the post-Nouvelle Vague films of Rohmer and Chabrol.  Wes Anderson, here, is showing, how much he loves these French films, and how influential they ultimately are.

hitcpll,Yeah the entire 2nd story reminded me of what Godard said about Masculin Feminine ‘children of Marxist and Coca-Cola’. Felt like Anderson was paying homage to the politics and pop of 60s French youth and Godard’s New Wave visions.,qi2eao

hkjqnjc,"At Alamo Drafthouse they played a lot of scenes from these and other films that were clearly paid homage to (what's another polite way to say lovingly copied?) which was fun, because they appeared as unrelated examples of French cinema until you actually watch the movie.",qi2eao
hj5uyrv,Hey I'm not familiar with the era at all! But it sounds like you are. One reference that was worrying my was the photo that Frances Macdormand's character has above her bed. It was so prominent I felt it had to mean something. Did you recognise it? I assumed it had to be a French film star from the era,qi2eao

hjlss0w,"I came here to say “meditation on loneliness”!! So glad you said it. I have seen I think all of Anderson’s films and while this one was somewhat “convoluted” in terms of vignettes vs a traditional plot, I loved how each piece was linked by the uniqueness of the storyteller/journalist and how their identities impact the subjects and the story arcs of the piece they’re writing.  I do wish we could have",qi2eao
hkgvlhq,so far yours is my favorite take on it. i’m gonna have to wait a while (when it comes out on dvd) to see it the 2nd time though! can’t wait,qi2eao
huqkwq4,The Grand Budapest Hotel is the best Wes Anderson movie.,qi2eao
hihz9y4,"Agreed. He looks to be in the next Anderson movie! Asteroid City.

Wright is consistently a delight in his roles--with great range. And while it's always fun for me to watch an Anderson movie and see those familiar faces, I think he would do well with some more diversity (Tony Revolori is a nice addition too).",qi2eao
hk9zulc,He had the most poignant part talking about how lonely it is to be an expat… that felt like some real emotion there.,qi2eao

hikcaso,His name was Paul.,qi2eao
hjtd3dv,"Reminded me of Lea Seydoux in Grand Budapest lol.  Like, I know that casting an A-list actors EVERYWHERE, even in minor roles, is Anderson's thing.  But I wasn't even sure it was really her the first time I watched it, her role is so small.  Glad she got a bigger role in this because I feel like she's perfect for his movies.",qi2eao
hkgv2bp,can you please tell me which scene he was in? because it’s bugging me that i didn’t recognize him. all i can gather from imdb & google was he was an art dealer called Paul Duvall,qi2eao

He was playing a passionate, young, idealic, insecure, virgin college student.  He wasn't playing a confident older man.",qi2eao
hmcspp5,"Re: comparing Brody with Tim, I’ll give Tim a pass because he was playing a dramatic college kid who’s heart was bigger than his sensibilities. He was acting out because he thought that’s what he was supposed to do. That’s why he struggled with his manifesto. He was trying to hard to evoke a romance to his motivations.",qi2eao
hlsifrh,"100% agree. Maybe I just have a thing against anthology films, with how hard it was to engage myself in the next story after being so invested in the previous, but the second story really did nothing for me. The last story had a lot of potential but it just felt so haphazardly made and convoluted, I was impatiently waiting for the film to wrap up. At least Wright and Brody were phenomenal!",qi2eao
hj3avon,"I agree that the second story falls flat. I don't think Timothee Chalamet has *it* (what ever *it* is.) and he certainly didn't have it in this movie either. The scenes were very beautiful and well constructed but in a movie about high art, the second story is the only one that felt slightly pretentious to me.",qi2eao
hp0qbaj,"You've well illustrated a lot of what I was feeling about this film. I've enjoyed others of Wes Anderson far more. By the time the animated car chase kicked off, I was past ready to be done. The development just wasn't there in the final one. I'm very curious how this film would work with the stories in a different order? 

Also about Chalamet...I've only seen him in Dune and this, so far. Neither showed me anything I cared much about. In Dune, it was a lot of face mugging for the camera, which doesn't impress me. I felt they really underdeveloped his, and many other, characters in that film, so maybe he didn't get a fair shake, but his was not a memorable performance. Momoa was the major standout there because he fit role well, understood it, and enjoyed it. 

Back to this film, Chalamet seemed to misunderstand the painfully dry delivery of most characters in Wes Anderson films. He left out the wit of that dryness and just delivered in a flat, bored, reporting quality for some lines that came off sounding like a high school play. Most characters in these films speak clearly and their beats are delineated by razor blades. It's part of the surreal quality they all share. He mushed everything...words and actions; most egregiously in the scene where he is playing peacemaker between the two women. Somewhat self-referentially hilarious that McDormand says his last line was, ""completely indecipherable."" Other times his delivery was tremulous and scattered, maybe intended to demonstrate a charming, passionate, awkward youth, but came off to me as a mess of a young actor eagerly trying to make a ""big choice."" I didn't sense any of the verve and vigor and sexuality called for by the character of a young revolutionary. He only had the look, and even that appeared bored and distracted most of the time. Most of the young guys in the barracks scene gave far more grounded and engaging performances, and I don't doubt some of them would have absolutely shined in the role of Zeffirelli...but of course, then you don't get the occupants of the girls' barracks coming out to see this film for their favorite fantasy boyfriend.

The artist story was beautifully done.

Jeffrey Wright was a sensational delight.

Don't imagine I'll rewatch this one.",qi2eao
hj4x7nz,Right? I like no Time To Die but sometimes it feels like a sequel to a movie that doesn't exist because I've just never been sold on that relationship. They're fine in that film but Spectre is so weak.,qi2eao
hjrdb8f,"I think the difference is Bond puts so much emphasis on that relationship and how important it is and brings in all these outside factors that make you wonder why Bond would sacrifice so much for *this* woman as opposed to all the others, whereas in French Dispatch it almost doesn't matter? We know Benicio sees something in her, whether it be physical or otherwise. Whether the audience agrees or not is almost beside the point (though I imagine all of us do). What matters is the art it produces. I can easily imagine an altered version of the story where she is unconventionally attractive and I think the result would be largely the same.",qi2eao

hii0e2q,"I liked Manifesto. The borderline idiocy and hope of youth Vs the ground down reality of the older McDormand who has seen this all before. 

Only kids fail to realise that adults were kids too. But the adults sometimes fail to realise that the rebelliousness is an important part of being a lid and you are the thing to rebel against even if you rebelled when you were younger. 

It was nostalgic and present simultaneously. I really liked it.",qi2eao
hiibuh1,"I thought the humor in the futility of teen rebelliousness was quite funny. I also thought the added commentary on the weakness of revolutions because of their division and conflicts when literally trying to make a ""borderless utopia"" was very funny, if only because it's so real. I think the title ""Revisions of a Manifesto"" works very well in that respect and of course because of the added subtext of it reflecting the recurring revisions of their lives and ideals people go through so often at that age when trying to find yourself.",qi2eao

Edit: I just saw your reply on another comment and I totally feel the same way.",qi2eao
hihnt1g,I agree the manifesto segment was one of the weakest. It was also where I felt the black and white treatment worked the least. It was preventing itself from giving more information rather than being an artistic merit. But it worked so well in the criminal artist segment because it could emphasize the art in the right moments.,qi2eao
hjl0yjb,I feel like the critique of this movie not being emotional are a big perplexing to me. There clearly is an underlying emotion of alienation and loneliness in all the stories.

The majority of the stories' time are in black and white, taking away his usual color palette to keep you more focused on the dialogue and interactions between the actual actors; the brief flashes of color (the guard leaving, the art piece reveal, flying away on the motorcycle, the girl's blue eyes) are intense emotions the character feels at that particular moment in time.

But the ultimate failure of the film was Wes not allowing his actors to find some distinguishing characteristics or make any interesting choices. Besides Brody and Swinton, and to a lesser extent Wright, none of the 30 something characters had any personality beyond muted and vaguely sad. It was like every character was just Margot from Royal Tenenbaums.",qi2eao
hvs5cih,"I have similar sentiments. People say that this was his best in various departments of filmmaking, but I don't see it.

Symmetry was better and simpler in The Grand Budapest as well as cinematography. That was prime Andersen OCD for me. The elevator scene with old Tilda Swinton was popping mad.

The amalgamation of actors was better in Moonrise Kingdom and Royal Tenenbaums.

He tried to insert his aesthetics of animation from Isle of Dogs for ""Private Dining Room"" - okay, fine - but it just felt out of place.

I prefer the quirkiness of characters of Life Aquatic.

* ""Revisions of a Manifesto""
* ""Private Dining Room of the Police Commissioner""
* ""Concrete Masterpiece""

2nd and 3rd place had their charms but overall they were forgetful.

Though I enjoyed ""The Cycling Reporter"", it was too short for me to consider it a ""main article."" Perhaps a nice intro to prep us for what was about to come, I suppose.

I thought Budapest was Andersen in prime self-indulgent mode, whereas in Dispatch he seemed like was trying to harken that but couldn't fully muster it. What I felt was ""obnoxious coordination"" in Moonrise has steadily become more obnoxious in each subsequent film, from Budapest and now in Dispatch.

The people of Liberty, Kansas deserved better than what they got in Arthur Howitzer Jr. None of the stories published in the final issue felt it couldn't have happened somewhere Stateside given it was 1975. Vietnam. Anti-war campus protests. Sexual Revolution. Conceptional and performance art movement. The abduction and eventual murder of Suzanne Sevakis. Maybe The French Dispatch was meant to be a lame pseudo-intellectual magazine where townies of Liberty where like thanks Arthur, we smoke cigarettes here as well.

I just don’t understand how you could watch this movie and think that it had a complete lack of emotion. The movie has plenty of emotion, just not Disney pomp or Oscar-bait wailing.

Did you not feel any emotion for the forbidden love between the maniac and the prison guard? Did you not feel any emotion when the college revolutionary was electrocuted and his parents can’t even speak? When the kidnapped kid is returned and he cries in the arms of his dad? When the gay journalist recounts being jailed for love, or his description of the chef yearning for a taste that he could only find in a poison?

God this was painful. I hope some of these A and B list actors realize how shitty this one was and bow out of his future works.

While the narrator's talking, it shows a very very Wes Anderson-y sequence of a tray being loaded up with different drinks then being delivered to the office.

Every past similar young male heart throb ran circles around his performances: Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp, even Tom Cruise. All these actors have a personal charisma that burns bright with energy, and Tim just lacks that in my honest opinion. I don’t see him reviving his career similar to Robert Pattinson. The kid just can’t really ACT, nearing zero characterization or study. He’s naturalistic enough, and fit in in Dune where everyone was just “being themselves”.

I recently took a 19th-century art class at college and a big theme in recontextualizing that period of art is the way that female nudity was representative of what the male beholder desired. To me, the way that nudity was portrayed in this piece was more of a critique of that historical framing than just ""male-gaze-y"" as you put it.",qi2eao

Haven’t seen this movie yet, but this is basically what Anderson always does. He has a neat trick of having the audience relate to his highly stylized characters through emotional “negative space” and pure situation rather than through the traditional ways humans convey emotion, the audience is straining to get to the emotional empathy that movies usually dish out so freely, so the moments of naturalism hit psyches that are as open as it’s possible for them to be, and it makes them shockingly intense for how subdued they objectively are.

Death is sad, generally speaking, and I think in this case what makes it such a moment is that he's surrounded and being mourned by the team he put together. The writers who were getting these important and entertaining stories to an area that otherwise might never receive them, thanks specifically to him for seeking them out and giving them financial and creative freedom. 

We don't spend a ton of time with his character, but from what we can see he is open minded, cares about his writers and their stories, and isn't as stuck in the ways of the time as others. The first thing we see him do is fight to not cut any story, as if to say all of them and his writers are equally important to him. He sounds like a good boss, and it's sad when someone who does what they do well passes. Not to mention, the publication is mentioned to end when he dies. Therefore it's not just the death of him, but the death of a great publication. 

It's also a nice scene because everyone is very sad, and then immediately they start doing exactly what he would have wanted. They start writing and finishing the (possibly final) issue. They have their moment then they get to work, and the first thing they do is memorialize him in a touching obituary that brings us right back to the beginning.

If we look at the original release plan:

* Filming took place between November 2018 and March 2019
* September 2019, Searchlight Pictures acquired distribution rights to the film.
* It was set to premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on May 12, 2020

That indictate that CoVID railroaded the B&W effect and the setting in the worst possible way.

hinciej,"I feel like it fit into the setting.

Did you catch the bit where the chef said he ate the poison not out of bravery, but due to being acutely aware of his being 'a foreigner' tying into fears of 'disappointing people' he was trying to fit in with?

It was a brief bit of dialog, but I feel like it might stick with me for a bit.",qi2eao
hiuvoi7,"So a movie set in France but still had two of the main stories be about Benicio Del Toro and Jeffrey Wright felt ""insanely white"" to you?",qi2eao

Take my upvote",qi2eao
hix9y2a,"Let me make it clearer: Someone whose focus when creating art is the art itself, not how it will reflect on them.",qi2eao
hilbi9y,This. It's a useful metric to discuss the disparity between stories that are male centric and stories that are equal or female centric overall in the industry. I will never understand why people cite it as a reason not to like or watch a movie though.,qi2eao
hn2xy4q,"The artist, because I have a soft spot for true romance :D But I really loved the ending of Wright's story, when they discuss what the true importance of the chef's story is. I thought that was the theme of the whole film right there!",qi2eao
himmehz,Yeah. I thought the color was used brilliantly. Surprised to see that anyone didn't like it.,qi2eao

It’s such a shame too, because I was actually about to drop the best snark bomb ever and I decided to do this reply instead.

hk09mnz,"The accidental nude slide totally got me. 

I disagree with OP though, I thought the keynote address was a great story telling device",qi2eao
hlgx6ua,"Sure!

The show really doesn't find its footing for about 5 episodes to be honest.

Eventually it ends up as a glorious comedy and drama that makes you hate everyone (but also root for them to get out or get better).

If you watched mad men it is sort of like mad men if we were set in the world of global finance news in the 2020s as opposed to advertising in the 1950s.",qi2eao

hkoeav9,"Lmao, I love self-deprecation.",qi2eao
hmbu9zr,Agreed! The backlash seemed to me a classic example of people who were looking to be offended by something mistaking depiction for endorsement. I love that movie.,qi2eao

hq43tlg,No. It’s just some guy.,qi2eao
hjlhizc,During the credits they do this thing where they appear in weird orders from different parts of the screen. One gag during that is putting up Tip-Top’s credit and then it gets replaced by the credit for the other guy. Like it gets pushed off the screen.,qi2eao
hjbblmo,"What I’m saying is that they *are*, in a sense, talking about him. The surface-level words are about the revolution but each of their statements also conveys something about their relationship with him and through him each other. There’s a reason it starts with the girl calling the journalist an old maid and ends with the journalist telling the two to go make love.",qi2eao
hjb7ev0,Is the insinuation here that there aren’t black people who are native citizens of France? I don’t have an issue with the current casting (all A-list stars for a reason) but this doesn’t feel like a counterpoint.,qi2eao
hlcqx71,"Which again, remains kind of hilarious when you consider the actors you're referring to.

And no, I do t think it's much of a ""vanity project"" for Jason Schwartzman, among others, who have worked with the director for over 20 years to pop up in the background with no lines. 

Have a nice a day, good luck with the stick removal.",qi2eao

hytfdti,"small role, in one or two episodes as an investor",qi2eao
hnr37kj,What would you say is lighter that he made? I suppose Bottle Rocket. Maybe Rushmore though I think it's darker than RT.,qi2eao
hjynxac,"Lol, Reservoir Dogs is basically a remake of the Hong Kong film City on Fire. If he's ripping anybody off, it's not the French. Most references in Pulp Fiction are to American films (e.g. film noirs). Apparently, there was one critic, who compared the temporal structure of the film to ""Last Year in Marienbad"" by Resnais, but that's a bit vague even for a deliberate homage. According to Tarantino, the dance scene is a homage to ""A Band Apart"" by Godard. So there's one reference to a French film. I don't understand, how anybody could say, Tarantino would rip off French cinema. Doesn't make sense to me.",qi2eao
hykk03y,"Yeah but like, the entire movie is with heavily stylized colorization.",qi2eao

Any questions?",qi2eao

How the hell do so many people think that's George Clooney or Jean Dujardin?

Like, have they actually looked at them before lol",qi2eao
hjbifrd,It’s a pretty poor take. Of course all 3 major characters are going to be linked in one way or another and their conversation would be irrelevant to the film if it was completely unrelated to the plot.,qi2eao
hllccz8,"In 1960? There were some Algerians but there were not very many black Africans in France. Even today, when I travel to nearby smaller towns by me, you will not see any black people at all.

hlcs82p,I thought it wasn’t his best movie and apparently the stick is yours to remove being that you can’t tolerate someone with a different view.,qi2eao
hihhkye,I’ll remind you that you’re literally trying to pick fights with strangers on the internet over a wes anderson movie. Presumably to passively full time and distract yourself from your own life. Why not just relate to the universal man,qi2eao

hp7mhqr,"Popping in to second this advice. There will be a few episodes where you will be asking yourself 'why should I care about these horrible wealthy assholes?' and then around ep 4-5 it'll grab you and then just take off and you'll be onboard the best and most shakespearean show in recent times.

It is easily the best show of the last decade. (closely followed by The Leftovers)",qi2eao
hp2usws,"Here's a better plain description, arrested development but with dark comedy and crueler family interactions. It's not as much broad comedy as it is fun seeing how deliciously cruel they are to each other, but still plays the oblivious Rich tropes well similar to AD",qi2eao
