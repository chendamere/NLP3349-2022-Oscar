fxjz0xa,"Oh man this was such a great film. It has a perfect balance between the typical Romantic Comedy, and a SciFi film. I was nervous they’d end it with an ambiguous ending on wether they got out, but it’s one of those few movies where I’m glad we got the happy ending.",hontcw
fxj4p3l,"I love Roy's reaction when he realized Sarah's plan worked.

fxjdbyf,"To say this movie was needed right now is a vast understatement. This film was such a fucking delight from start to finish. 

One of the many things I have to praise the film for is just how well paced the first 20 minutes are. You get Nyles and his problems all laid out just in the opening scene alone, him having everything planned out even before the inevitable time loop reveal (the dance at the wedding was pretty obvious toward that), trying to get at Sarah with his casual wedding toast which leads to them hooking up, and when she jumps into the time loop and enters “the next day”, it’s so well edited from both of their POV’s, I kept smiling the whole way through as to just how on point the whole opening felt. Very rare for comedies to have that kind of pacing.

Samberg and Milioti have such remarkable chemistry between each other that it didn’t feel like a chore to sit through when this whole concept has been done countless times. 

The movie did a lot of stuff that felt refreshing and unique, but the two scenes that stood out to me were after Sarah runs over Roy and Nyles explains to Sarah that they can still feel pain leading up to one of the twists. It made you sympathize with both of them because you would have to get to a point to be where Sarah is at in being stuck in that time-loop for god knows how long and Nyles having already felt those feelings numerous times. 

The second scene being Roy and Nyles having their heart to heart at Roy’s house. It’s a scene not a lot of screenwriters would add, but because they did, it gave them so much emotional heft as to what they have both been going through and having that understanding of the struggles of being stuck in the time-loop forever. A comedy made me feel that existential reality!

This is hands down one of my favorite movies of the year, even if all of the releases were to have come out if the ‘Rona didn’t happen, still would’ve been in my Top 10 of the Year!

The only thing that sucks is not being able to experience this in a theater with a packed crowd, so many of the jokes would’ve killed in a theater... I just miss watching movies in a theater, especially comedies.",hontcw

fxkv44g,"Maybe I am alone in this, but for *Palm Springs*, *Russian Doll* and *Groundhog Day*, I feel like I would happily watch an extended cut with even more nihilistic time loop shenanigans without getting bored at all. I understand why it has to be done in a snappy montage since hijacking planes or learning silly dance routines does not advance the story, but it's such a fun premise to watch actors play around in.",hontcw

fxj0cpd,"This is a brilliant movie, actually somehow has a fairly unique take on the whole time loop idea. 

Works so much better having Niles have already been in it for ages before he's joined by someone new. Basically got the best of both worlds when it came to skipping over the ""lets try this to get out"" but still get a couple of good gags in there like the suicide.

Glad they managed to get a message to Roy at the end too.

 Though I think the new husband is a total scumbag, snorting lines on his wedding day and cheating on his wife who was saving herself for marriage with her sister...what are we supposed to think he's actually going to be a good husband now? He did literally nothing redeeming the whole movie...

""One of those Shaggy Dogs"" was a great last line though.

fxsfcxv,"I'm a big fan of Andy Samberg and The Lonely Islamd in general, but going into this I had no idea of the premise whatsoever. Only knew it was a Romcom with sci-fi elements.

When I realized they were pulling a Groundhog Day I was expecting disappointment.

HA!",hontcw
fxjp0gl,"Good movie, hit me with some really specific feelings.

So Roy had the option of leaving the loop for his own timeline where Sarah and Nyles never knew him. I guess that means they went to a world where he doesn't know them. I wonder if they got together under normal circumstances?

Yeah, the grandmother was 100% in the loop too. She'd already achieved her bliss, spending time with her family. Makes her compliment to Nyles there at the beginning really genuine. 

The bartender was great. Seems like she has her own weird thing going on. I guess other people like her could've been in the loop too in other timelines.",hontcw
fxj5r8u,"I saw the movie and loved it.  I have always loved the time loop movies.

fxjqglz,"*Palm Springs* is tons of fun and thoroughly interesting.

It's a conglomerate of genres—jumping from heartwarming romance, to crazy physical comedy, to time-traveling sci-fi in this distinctly snappy yet fluid pace.

It may not go down as one of the best rom-coms or time loop movies of all time, but it's a solid **8 out of 10** in my book.

I'd gladly recommend it to a friend looking for something good to stream.",hontcw
fxqppwo,Wow. I watched this with zero idea of what I was going into and I can easily say this is probably the most I've laughed all year. This movie came out at a perfect time when everyday feels monotonous and unmemorable. Easily one of my new favorite movies.,hontcw
fxj9ars,"I truly loved it. I’m not a fan of rom coms for a while , with the exception of Netflix Set it up, but, this really is worth the watch. Andy and Cristin are brilliant together. One of my favorite movie experiences this year",hontcw
fxln38a,"Really enjoyed it. Uses the sci-fi trope very effectively to make a relatable movie about young relationships. Nyles is the stereotype 20-something man scared to grow up and leave his comfort zone of living life with no consequences. Sarah, being more matured by virtue of her more difficult life experience, is determined to leave her past behind and move forward, refusing to just waste time anymore. They escape and take the next step in their relationship by doing something scary with no safety or assurance that it will work.

Roy is old enough to realize that the day he has is perfect, and he comes to peace with it (though I am glad that he escapes in the end). I thought his scene with Nyles at his house is one of the best of the movie.",hontcw
fxko8fc,"Really enjoyed this movie! Love me some time loop flicks.

While it doesn't matter that much, does anyone have a theory for the following:

>!She sends the goat through, blows it up and it doesn't reappear in their universe/reality/""energy box"". However, when Roy goes to the party, there is a version of Nyles. So shouldn't there either a) have been a version of the goat or b) not be a Nyles?!<",hontcw
fxkjrwr,This movie is so good. My new Groundhog Day for sure.,hontcw
fxnp4lc,"I'm not really an Andy Samberg fan but he was flat out brilliant in this. The best anything he's ever done. Cristin Milioti stole the show for me, though. Her ""What the FUCK!"" reaction to the first arrow is the first time this year I've laughed so hard I was crying. I'm not familiar with her, but I look forward to whatever she does next. They were both so perfect with each other, as well. 

I went into this blind and it was such an inventive and surprising experience. I love time loop films, and this is honestly one of the best. It's a perfect marriage of rom-com and scifi/time travel. And unlike Vivarium it didn't suffocate me to death with dread and existential panic, but they are both great films dealing with similar themes and would make a great double feature. Probably my favorite film of 2020 next to The Vast of Night.",hontcw

fy4oxs9,"I've not found any mention of this on Reddit so far but the brand of beer they constantly drink is Akupara (only really clear in the first shot after >!they blow themselves up and the screen goes black!<). It's not a real brand of beer - but it IS the Hindu name for the World Turtle. One theory of the World Turtle is that it's an infinite stack of turtles (""Turtles All The Way Down""). It's been used as an illustration of the problem of infinite regression - but in this case it may allude to the potentially infinite repetition which goes on in the time loop.",hontcw
fz0hzyj,"Watched this last night, thought it was great. Now have a theory.

Not only is Nana in the time loop (which I've seen other people say), but she's been in the time loop for far longer - and that Nyles, Sarah, and Roy have left the time loop before. 

If you think about it, Nyles on the first, original, day, walked into the cave to start the time loop. When he and Sarah escaped, we see from the credits scene with Roy that a version of Nyles is still in the loop, but doesn't remember any of it. Therefore, he would go about his day the way he originally did - which means eventually ending up in the cave and back in the time loop. Then he would, of course, pull Roy and Sarah in eventually, and then they would escape.   


This has all happened before and will happen again. This is the only way to explain how Nana knew Sarah was about to leave - because she knows that when Sarah actually gives a good speech, it's the day she escapes. Presumably the first time this happened Nana was in on it, and made the choice to stay behind, and so that's how she can tell when Sarah is acting differently.",hontcw
fxlrd2x,"This film is so charming. I haven't smiled about life & quotes about it in a while especially at this time, and watching a technically nihilistic film is the least thing I expect to make me feel good today. 

I'm genuinely curious though how did Nyles get into the loop? And his job and family, much like we got a peek into Sarah's & Roy's relationships.",hontcw
fxmwkpg,"The top review for the film on Letterbox ([click here to read it](https://boxd.it/XRoVH)) points out that this film uses the time loop concept as a metaphor for marriage, which I think makes the film so much better and deeper. The idea that marriage is essentially living the same day over and over again, and like this movie, living it with the same person everyday. It also makes Roy’s line “there’s nothing worse than doing this alone” much more poignant, as it can be considered as “there’s nothing worse than going through life alone”. 

I love this interpretation, since it just makes so much sense in the context of the story. A time loop where the characters are reliving a wedding, Nyles’ speech about marriage in the beginning, Sarah’s history and feelings about marriage, and the fact that Roy lives the same day over and over again with his unknowing family. 

This will be one of those classics, that in several years people will look back on and say “how did this not win any awards?”",hontcw
fxma6xa,"One of the better movies I've seen in 2020. It was clever, heart warming and made me genuinely laugh out loud more than a few times. I absolutely loved it. 

Honestly first movie in a long time where I don't have many complaints. I'm not saying the movie is without flaws but like all the really good movies it was so engrossing i was too busy being entertained and enjoying myself to see them so bravo all involved with the film.

It somehow also had interesting things to say about the nature of relationships without being heavy handed about it. 

Almost wish there was 5 more minutes to it just so I could spent more time with the characters.",hontcw
fy0k5ig,Was the selfless act Sarah whispering to her sis she banged her hubby to be?,hontcw
fydki2q,"A small musing. Once they break the time loop, it stands to reason that everyone they interacted with on that final November 9th will carry the memory of those interactions through to November 10th. So they'll remember the moving speech Sarah gave about her sister and telling Abe not to fuck it up or Nyles starting a fight with Ted and stealing his pick-up.  
Which also means that Spuds will now think Nyles is his long lost son.

fylru2l,"Oh my god, the scene after they have sex when Sarah is looking at Nyles sleeping and just smiling and trying not to fall asleep herself so it all lasts longer - and then both of them waking up in that warm glow of falling in love, all smiles and bliss - just broke my heart.",hontcw

fxm0hsf,Yes! I finally made it early enough to comment on one of these threads! Something interesting I observed about the movie...do you even notice how an average romcom has little to no backstory about the female lead? And her whole point of existence in the movie is for the male lead to have a turning point? I felt a gender-reversal for that concept with this movie. We got to know so much about Sarah’s life and why she is the way she is. We know little to nothing about Nyles life. The film cleverly makes that point right at the end when they are floating in the pool and he says “oh I have a dog Fred.”,hontcw
g0wzkc4,"I think the dinosaurs wandered into a bigger and slightly different version of the cave in the early cretacious period and have been treading that same piece of remote desert, day by day, for millions of years.

fxt7u20,"I've probably rewatched this 3 times in the last day. It reminds me so much of The Good Place, lots of meta & philosophical cues to follow or rebel against but all worthy of a little googling and reading on. The laughter happens but the writing & lines linger long. 

I loved when Nyles said, ""Why go back out there when there's death, poverty, and debilitating emotional distress?"" (non-verbatim). He also valued how pain is still very much felt, and that the day may reset yet pain, whether inflicted on others or to self, time doesn't pass enough for it to heal. *""Your best bet is to suffer existence.""*

Also loved how Sarah confronted her need for escape with good old quantum physics. One can say that this film held up a lot of mystic elements with the cave & all, yet only to be solved with some hard science ^((coughs in 2020)) that was *learned and experimented on,* not just your usual aha! moment that involved a true love's kiss, a survival quest, or a search for some magical key token that will save them.

Roy is such a good rep that it's our own psyche that decides whether the situation is terrible or tolerable. The time loop sure is lonely and filled with angry monsters that haunt every so often, but it's also a constant choice amongst all things. Then Sarah came along, made the decision to leave, and helped those who haven't figured it out yet.

Not a philo major, & would really love some insight on this. Nyles & Roy strongly showed Nihilism, actively destroying each other in their void until Sarah, showing Existentialism, came along. At some point they all met in the grounds of Absurdism & Pragmatism. And somewhere along those loops, love happened. 

Could be a commercial happy ending, sure. It really helped my mental health too knowing they've outgrown a terrible version of themselves. But it also felt right to know that the risk they took, took them forward. Humanity is so insatiate that we forget to relish time & how it unceasing it is.

That and, Andy & Cristin & JK should make a character ensemble series. That on-screen chemistry is worth a million bucks.",hontcw

We had a movie where girl chases guy, and is also given this gift to clean herself up, etc. We dont really get any of that. Once they sleep together it turns into a guy chases girl movie. 

At the end he even apologizes to her but it seemed like she was the one who acted weird and ran away. So it just turned into the same thing. Guy chases girl, has speech, gets the girl.

fy0gbbd,"Very good movie. A great concept that they pretty much nailed. 

Time travel movies usually have plot holes and I only saw one in this one, the goat. The goat should’ve been back the next day after she exploded it, but with no memories of her or that day, since that’s what happened to (at least) Nyles.  They could’ve written around that with her training the goat or some other animal somehow, and when it came back without the training she would know it had worked.

They did wrap up a grim ending brilliantly. Roy coming back and talking to Nyles 1 may have been enough to alter the timeline so that he doesn’t find the cave. Otherwise, Nyles 1 gets stuck in the loop all over again. Now, the 1 versions of everyone end up back in their pretty shitty lived, but the 2 versions at least get happy endings. 

Great acting across the board. Great writing. I think it was a little too to-the-point with the sci fi elements to encourage the theory crafting and what-ifs that leave some speculative sci fi end up burned in your psyche, but for what it was it was great. God bless them for not just leaving the ending totally open ended with a fade to black after the explosion; that would’ve spoiled it for me.",hontcw

When Sarah first started getting into the timeloop, she would wake up sad everyday, and later we find out also very guilty. But as she falls in love with Nyles, they start to wake up happy everyday since they are spending it together, even if it's the same day.  


9/10 it was fun and pretty much what I expected given the budget and all that. The quantum physics was sort of a cop out IMO, but overall I enjoyed it.



Edit: I also enjoyed all the Ah-ha moments this movie had as you figured things out. How Andy knew to put the chair behind the drunk uncle, how he knew Sarah didn't have a speech, when you find out the Grandma was in the loop hence why she said Andy's speech that day was her favorite yet.",hontcw

fxzmneo," In a year where every day of the year feels the same, it's fitting that the best film of 2020 is set in a time loop. Samberg and Milioti are tremendous together, their chemistry is one of the best seen on screen in a long time. The clever spin on the beloved concept is boosted through big laughs and a soundtrack to die for. Instead of focusing purely on wacky shenanigans. I appreciate that the film makes you question what you would do in the character's shoes.

fxk1ben,"A rom-com story that feels prescient given the current circumstances of the world, but also a very fun and inventive twist on the ""Groundhog day"" theme that is becoming a genre of it's own.  

It's been well over 100 days that most of us in the states have been dealing with the limited outside interactions. From going to the office regularly to working from home, not being able to travel to visit loved ones far away. Day after day, everything starts to blend together. There are two sides to the coin of living in isolation, and they are wonderfully explored in this fun movie. 

The first examination is of the couple living together. At first it's great, you develop you're own inside jokes, try to set up new routines, make the lemonade out of the lemons. Eventually, living with another person may feel like a chore, the honeymoon stage ends. You or the other might say something off the cuff that wouldn't normally bother one but the built up tension of only being with each other leads to hurt feelings. Fights may break out over what feel like small things. But you're ability to make best of it, understanding that this person makes you a better person. Accepting the partners for who they are, flaws and all. Understanding that not everyday is going to feel like you're living on cloud 9, but still choosing this life. In the climax of the movie,  the big speech moment really bring home this point. 

>!""What if we get sick of each other?""

>!""We're already sick of each other, it's the best.""


The other side of the coin is living in true isolation. The feeling that no one can empathize with what you're going through. Longing for someone to share your thoughts with. You try to make the days meaningful as they all blend together. You're mental health starts to slip and you may not have the best coping mechanisms for your new reality. You have to come to grips in living with yourself. Finding beauty in the little things. 

Cristin Milioti, Andy Samberg, and JK Simmons all play their parts perfectly. The blend of their different styles of comedic delivery with some truly heartfelt moments mixed in. Samberg will not be making the jump to movie star leading man with this role, but his comedic timing is enough to keep us engaged in this story. Milioti held her own on screen in each scene shared with Samberg, able to show off her own comedic brilliance. And of course, JK Simmons shines as the grumpy old man hell bent on torturing Samberg. 

In the end each character is only able to escape after self realization. Milioti understanding that her terrible past doesn't have to dictate her future, Samberg learning that life has value even during times that it seems bleak, and Simmons learning to let the hatred go. Only once all three are able to overcome their personal obstacles are they ready to move on.  

I'm probably overthinking this 90 minute comedy but I enjoyed every minute of it.",hontcw

a. In the mid-credits Roy meets a 'reset' Nyles, unless Roy stops him this Nyles will probably wander into the cave again and start looping again.

b. What happens if one looper stays awake overnight and the other looper falls asleep and then wakes up eventually?

c. I believe the dinosaurs are real and are/were caught in the event horizon of the time loop and get dragged to whenever the cave emerges

fxyddsw,"I was pretty high when I watched the film but I thought the overall message was profound. Like I know it had that science fiction backdrop, but it was really a metaphor to how real relationships work i.e. going through life without someone might seem like an endless black hole where you're doing the same mundane shit day in and day out, but then you meet someone who puts a smile on your face and gives you a reason to get up out of bed every day. But then it gets to the point where you become scared over the prospect of losing that person in your life.


I did not know a thing about this film going into it, but I never expected it to get so existential.",hontcw
fxlbzt3,"Only thing I wanted was for when Sarah finished explaining her post-montage theory to get out, Andy Samberg would either finish her sentence or say I know and reveal that he had also in the millions of years he'd been looping before her had learned the science behind it but was too scared to ever attempt.

I just always liked the aspects that time loops provide for acquiring almost superhuman knowledge that Groundhog Day had where we learn that Bill Murray had learned things like the piano and different languages, so it would have been nice if they had a few more of those moments in Palm Springs.",hontcw
fxrwh0d,"My takeaway from the film's ending was that it was them finally entering and embracing leaving the time loop. In the scene of Nyle and Sarah camping in the desert and witnessing the dinosaurs, the tent could be used as a metaphor for their pocket of looped space, where inside of it they were close, intimate, confined, and relatively safe. Outside is the unknown, or rather things they don't understand or comprehend because it's not a part of their repetitive routine. In reality, the dinosaurs aren't really dinosaurs, but a representation of what awaits them if they ever get out, and I feel Samberg's ""That's new."" line with a look of confused bewilderment is evident of that theory. 

The ending, after they blow up the cave and are in the November 10th family's pool, Nyle mentions his dog he'd never talked about in the countless loops he and Sarah experienced. She acts incredulous at the idea that he'd never brought this up before, and they both laugh at the idea of it being a shaggy dog. This thought, that wherever they're at now they're together, and even after spending so much time getting to know each other there are still new things to learn about them, is ultimately what the dinosaurs can be interpreted as. They're embracing the unknown and are going to make the best of it.

Can they be woken up again, creating an alternate version of themselves that escapes the loop (since it's established that going to sleep always restarts the loop)?

fxjg2v2,"This was a cute movie. It didn't really move me in a big way but the premise was pretty interesting and there were some legitimately funny cutaway gags. I had no idea what this movie was about and I'd suggest going in the same because I was totally thrown off by the first appearance of Roy.

Seems like this movie is a really interesting allegory for how people look at low stakes relationships, and in that way I thought it was really good. I think there's something to be said about how Niles has no stakes in his life including the many hookups with Sarah, and how messy things can get when you start to develop feelings (i.e. when he brings her into the world) but you still want to keep life uncomplicated and without consequence. In that sense I really liked the ending and how they forced Niles into a commit or flounder situation. I think getting out of the time loop was a metaphor for choosing to progress a relationship and not just always keep it in the ""hangout and vibe"" mode. Something that maybe hits a little too close to home for me. 

I also really enjoyed how this angle of the Groundhogs Day situation was more sci-fi. Once I figured out what the movie was I was waiting for the reveal that they had to follow some sort of rules or, like Sarah thought, achieve some sort of selfless status. So it was a pretty good look when the loop got solved by quantum physics. It reminded me a lot of Safety Not Guaranteed with the relationship and sci-fi twist as well as the leap of faith in the end. That said, part of me wishes they had left the end open like Safety Not Guaranteed did. I think the scariest and most exhilarating part of entering a relationship is not knowing where you may come out and I think that idea would have held better if they didn't have that final scene. Would have been cool to just cut to the final Roy scene after they go in the cave. So that we know Niles got out but we don't how it ended up for him.

My take is this. The first time Nyles and Sarah see the dinosaurs, they are both high as a kite and are most likely sharing a hallucination. They're happily tripping. However, the final scene pans away to show the audience three dinosaurs walking past the landscape at a distance. I'd peg the final visuals to be a metaphoric representation of how unreal breaking out of the loop must feel like. The initial appearance of the extinct creatures was hallucinatory. Sarah and Nyles have been looping for what appears to be a couple of lifetimes. Now that they have escaped, their actual *yesterday* and the life they lived up to the point of the looping would feel as fuzzy and imaginary as the hazy dinosaurs we are shown in the ending of Palm Springs.",hontcw

In Groundhog Day, Bill Murray literally breaks the loop by growing as a person... but here, they don't need to grow, not *technically*. They just need to do a very specific thing in order to leave the time loop, and the time loop itself couldn't care less about their morality or personal growth or crap like that. But Sarah only finds out how to escape by setting the hedonistic fun aside and focus on really, fully understanding what's going on, and Nyles only can leave by making amends and showing his own growth to Sarah once she figures it all out.

Great movie. A lot goes between the lines. Niles did everything and most of it isn’t things he’d wanted to do anymore. 

Some throwaway comment about how this time he’d leave the loop with Sarah, or hint of that would have been interesting. 

Not only that he’s done everything before, but even pulled her in and she figured out how to escape many times. That even her getting stuck in the loop was intentional and he did it that way so she wouldn’t pull a Roy.

fz7skae,"So I posted this on r/fantheories but I condensed it down for the discussion thread: 

&nbsp;

So first of all I do believe that Nana has been in the loop much longer than Nyles or Sarah, based on her parting remarks to Sarah, but I think it goes even farther than that. 

&nbsp; 

At the end of the movie when it's revealed that leaving the loop creates a version of Nyles in the loop that doesn't have memories of being in the loop you should be worried for Nyles because, as Sarah said, if you aren't able to learn from your mistakes you are doomed to repeat them, and if everything was reset that day then Nyles would inevitably be trapped in the loop again.

&nbsp;
 

BUT this inevitable result can be avoided if you consider one possibility - that Nana was actually the original person in the time loop and that she is the one that secretly manipulated Nyles into it. 

&nbsp;

So this is how I see it all playing out. The first iteration that the time cave is opened no one goes in there because why would they - its out in the middle of nowhere. But at the same time it's out in nature so there are animals and insects around which will inevitably wander in. For the animals and insects their memories are more limited so they might be confused for a few hundred loops but would eventually settle into some sort of random pattern. This randomness over trillions upon trillions of loops would eventually lead to a human stumbling in - the first human being Nana.

&nbsp;

Once Nana goes in she goes through thousands of iterations slowly learning about what happens and eventually bringing someone else in either intentionally or by accident. Over the years one of these people that Nana brings in figures out how to get out of the loop just like Sarah did and offers Nana the same choice but Nana doesn't take it yet - because like any self respecting old person at a wedding she wants to play matchmaker.

&nbsp;

She realizes that she has an infinite amount of time to produce the best outcomes for every single person at that wedding - to produce the best future for all these friends and family that she has known and loved her entire life. This would also give her the chance to extend her own golden years a million times. It’s a pretty good deal. So she gets to work figuring out all of the problems that people have and finding a solution based on manipulating them into the loop with the right combination of people and events. Nana does this in a very subtle way, for example in the case of Nyles and Sarah she interjects about how good the speech was just enough to get the two of them in the right place at the right time. This may seem like an impossible task but remember that she has had thousands of years to study these people and their behavior.
 
&nbsp;

For Nyles, Sarah, and Roy it was the right combination to be in there because Nyles and Roy can help each other learn the value of appreciating “finding your Irvine” and Sarah and Nyles could learn to trust and love each other. Nana always has the upper hand within the loop because she always keeps secret the fact that she is also in the loop and therefore is able to know and observe them without being suspected.
 
&nbsp;

So based on this theory after Roy finds out how to leave at the end of the movie he will proceed to explode himself out and appear on the same day as Nyles and Sarah but with all three of their memories intact and all three of them better people for having been in the loop.

&nbsp;

After Nana is done matchmaking and fixing the lives of everyone at the wedding she finishes by exploding herself out while maybe also training some type of hawk to learn who she is and disrupt her routine on the wedding day so she does not end up randomly wandering into the cave again in future iterations. She then appears on Nov 10 as the last person out of the time loop after having fixed everyone and gets to see how everyone turns out after having been given a chance to put their best foot forward.",hontcw

I know it's not at all a hard sci-fi film, and time travel is notoriously difficult to interpret in a way that seems consistent, but it's fun to dissect it anyway and I have a couple of questions.

&#x200B;

* When the day resets, is that rolling back the same timeline over and over again (albeit the others don't remember), or is creating a new ""branch"" and the others will continue with their lives on their branch?
* When she explodes the donkey, it doesn't appear to her on the next loop, however when they explode themselves, Nyles does appear to Roy. Is there a reason for this difference?
* When they explode themselves, do they have one last time in the loop before continuing on as normal, do they wake up the next day on the 10th?
   * I'm very much assuming the latter based on Nyles' interaction with Roy (i.e. it seems legitimate, not a coy act of not knowing, and why would he even do that to begin with), but one user on this thread seemed to set on it being the former, so I thought I'd bring it up.
   * If it is the latter, then it does actually seem to suggest there are multiple branches as I touched on in my first bullet point, as there is clearly a Nyles who doesn't know anything of all this, and a Nyles who continued on with Sarah in full knowledge of what happened.",hontcw

I went into this movie blind (highly recommend). It was attention grabbing from the beginning. The pace and the tone of the movie was right up my alley. It was dark, fast pace, hilarious and dry, thought provoking, and romantic. I can go into all the details but there’s a few things i want to focus on that are not mentioned on this reddit thread, that one, i would love to discuss and two, need the answers to.

Things i’d love to discuss: 

Funniest parts of the movie: the run on sentence at the end, the bomb in the cake gag, and the experimenting sexually part.

Favorite parts: i thought the ending was so clever and well put together. Two subtle things i loved. One being when Roy moves right past the tuna appetizers, you know he’s in the loop. And two, the family showing up on November 10th (i thought that was sooo good).

Subtle questions: Why is the cocaine different colors? What’s with the dinosaurs? Im confused how Sarah and niles broke out of the time loop but still remember everything from the past time loops?

Lastly: if you don’t think the grandma is in the loop you are on more mushrooms than niles and Sarah.

ilzu12u,"Once they escape the loop Roy finds the original day 1 version of Nyles at the wedding who has no memory of anything that has happened.  
However, there was obviously something that happened on that original night that resulted in Nyles being in the cave.

The only way to avoid it starting again is if Roy stopped Nyles from entering the cave.",hontcw
iqxae8l,"Is this a place to ask for theories?

The day doesn't reset at a certain time. We know that because Nyles stayed up for 72 hours and got to Equatorial Guinea. We can also suppose the bodies don't immediately disappear, because Roy kills Nyles in a bin, presumably to hide the body.

So, does it reset when they lose consciousness? What if someone else stuck in the loop is watching them? If one falls asleep, and the observer stays awake, what happens to that first person's body? And if it doesn't just disappear, could they wake back up making it into a different day?

If Nyles, Roy and Sarah lived together and agreed that one of them would always be awake, could they progress through time instead of looping back?

Or, does each day result in a split - one returns to the start and the other progresses? So, there's an ongoing multiverse where each day has consequences for some version of them? There are extant futures where they die in the cast crash, where Nyles reveals they were cheating etc.? A multiverse.",hontcw
fxt53t2,"Could Nana actually be Sarah?

This is a little out there, but here’s my logic:

1.  When she first shows up, she’s like, “Dear, I’ve been to more weddings than you can imagine... and that speech was the best I’ve ever heard.” Could just be an old lady being nice, I suppose.
2. Sarah teaches herself quantum physics in lord knows how many time loops. Probably a lot? She figures out how to exit the loop, so theoretically, she could also figure out how to re-enter it at a later point and witness the early days of love with Nyles over and over again. In fact, perhaps she’s even got something to do with creating the time loop.
3. Toward the end, first, she’s like, “you know, I lost my mother when I was young, too.” and then she’s like, “well, I guess you’ll be leaving soon.” again, this is a fairly innocuous comment, but maybe she recognizes this as the final loop.",hontcw

fxln4mi,"This was a really great movie. I think that during a time when we're all stuck inside and time feels both fast and slow, this was a much needed watch. It was really fun seeing characters live without consequence for a while. I feel like it allowed me to live vicariously during a time where I'm so tamely doing nothing. Like, if I were stuck in a time loop I would absolutely do drugs with JK Simmons or try to sleep with the bride. 

It was also great seeing there different characters react so differently to the loop. Roy eventually finds a peace with it, and we empathize with him not seeing his kids grow up. Nyle and the nihilism (Nyle-ism) stuff is certainly a path I could see myself going down, as is Sarah and the sheer willpower to find a way out. Nyle is a great guide to Sarah early in the film, and it's really funny to see his ambivalence foiled against her denial and optimism. 

I was only previously familiar with Cristin Milioti in HIMYM and in some YT clips from Once. It was really great seeing her play such a different, flawed character. She does a great job conveying the pain that her character has clearly gone through while balancing it with the carelessness that she describes herself with early in the film. I think she was fantastic from start to end.

The overall arc between the two characters is a bit predictable, but it doesn't detract from the general fun of the film. There were a lot of genuinely funny scenes, and I think it's been a long time since I've seen a romcom done this well.",hontcw

If I could tweak it just a tiny bit I’d decrease the **cheesiness** at the end by 50%, made them feel like Hollywood characters rather than real people when the movie so cleverly sidesteps many of the romcom pitfalls. 

And I’d replace that with **more humour and absurdism**, because the loop allowed for that beautifully. The fork in the face horror moment was a treat. 

I’ll continue to blindly watch anything that Samberg is involved in, **Popstar** is one of my most rewatched films of all time. Also, I’m _so_ happy I didn’t watch a single trailer for this movie, going in blank really is the most fun when you’re in the hands of a good director.",hontcw

This theory is kind of destroyed by the mid credits scene but oh well.

g0y4svq,"So here’s the question that’s wrinkling my brain:

To start, it’s my interpretation that each and every loop represents a spin-off alternate dimension. Assuming 40ish years since Nyles first went into the cave, that’s 14k to 15k dimensions created by Nyles, all beginning with his going into the cave on the original night. With me so far?

So... in the end, Nyles and Sarah blasted their way out and Roy bumped into an alternate version of Nyles at the wedding. In theory, this should be the version of Nyles on the first night he went through the cave. Nyles 1.0, the guy with literally all the same thoughts, feelings and experiences leading up to that moment he meets Roy at the bar. 

So what stops this new Nyles 1.0 from going into that cave and starting the whole thing over again? Like he did the first time he experienced the wedding for the first time? Are there versions of Nyles, Sarah and Roy that are doomed to repeat this cycle for all eternity? Or should we hope that Roy, while he is still in the loop, must now babysit Nyles to make sure he doesn’t stumble into the cave again?

Something to think about.",hontcw

Old Lady mentions she has seen many wedding speeches and the joke, which we don't know at the time, is that Andy Sandberg's character has seen \~40 years worth of wedding speeches daily.

Then the dinosaurs. Could they have entered a time loop from the same source but 65M years ago that brings them to the same November 9th where the wedding takes place?

obviously she is in the loop too, and I think she's been in it longer than anyone else but we started talking about ... how many people are in the loop. 

What if EVERYONE is in the loop. I'm not saying that's happening in the movie - but we thought it would be fun for a movie or book (more likely a book as a movie would sag under the weight) where everyone is in a daily loop but they think they are the only one (or a small group like Roy/Sarah/Nyles). Each ends up throwing off one another every day. 

Alternatley, something like this but every little while Nyles gets bored and takes another person to the cave. He has said he's got to know every guest over the (40 year per the screenwriter) loop.

God the implications are nightmarish.

EDIT: Oh my god fuck fuck fuck okay EVERYONE LISTEN TO ME!

I was talking to my sister and I realized that Nyles' original timeline involved going to the cave. So if Roy is in the original timeline so to speak, Nyles is just going into the cave all over again, startling the loop again.

BUT hear me out. What if Roy accidentally led Nyles to the cave? In his escape, Nyles goes in and starts his loop. Then he brings in Roy and Sarah, before exiting and Roy finding Nyles and accidentally leading him to the cave in the first place.

I realized something. 


It was logical for Nyles to run and go to the cave after he was shot because he will die slowly which is something he doesn't like as he stated that thing about slowly dying in an ICU. So he'd want to restart his day immediately instead of suffering in pain. 

Because at first viewing I thought it was like a lazy plot device to put Sarah on the loop with him. But then I realized that it was logical and it made sense.

How would life be now that he especially has to face real death being a possibility again, work, be accountable for the first time in how long??? How long would their relationship last, what about the cheating groom? If Nyles and Sarah went to see Roy the next day would he be a different Roy? Do they find the Goat! Or what if one of them got diagnosed terminally ill would they choose to go back to the cave and live together indefinitely or choose to live out their lives.

Like, when Sarah fell out of the car, she would wake up again in a new timeline with another Nyles while the Nyles that was driving would continue on with his day until he also died or went to sleep, creating another separate timeline with its own Sarah, right?

fybe3l4,"**Major Spoilers Below**

I'm honestly disappointing in the Film's ending, and I think it's because I wish it had been a 10 episode tv show instead.

This  movie has too much content potential especially in terms of character growth and relationship potential shoved into to little time and that only really comes out at the half way point after they do mushrooms and sleep together. From that moment we fly through:

1.  Them walking up feeling warm loving feelings.
2. Sarah instantly realizing her guilt about sleeping with Abe.
3. Sarah and Nyle having a fight that is mostly due to Sara hating herself and ignoring Nyle's feelings. But also due to Nyle being upset at her aggression against Roy.
4. Nyle revealing that he lied to her about sleeping with her.
5. Sarah completely disappearing form Nyle's life and not talking to him for what seems like months.
6. Flash forward past all that other stuff that was good content but not too important to their relationship.
7. Nyle has become increasingly committed to a woman who has avoided him for months and isn't even angry at her. This is never addressed past him lamp-shading it in the cave calling himself codependent.
8. Sarah has spent all this time doing science to try to break the loop but has put no energy into Nyle during this time. Which is totally fine if that's what she wants to do. But the fact that she abandons him for months despite all they've had, never explains herself at all, never even checks in on him. Really underscores how much she doesn't love him in a sincere and mutual way.
9. They fight, he wants to stay, and she's not ready to wait one day more just to convince him to leave or do anything. Again fine her choice but it's less her growing as a character and more her running away from her problems (specifically that she fucked her sister's fiance).
10. So while she has shown initiative and intelligence, she's acting in a massively selfish way driven by her guilt. She treats Nyle like shit and he clings to her because she's the only human he's spoken to in years that remembers anything new about him (Roy murdering him doesn't count). The more we see Nyle at this phase the more I feel like he's been severely traumatized by the time loop and is so lacking in a sense of autonomy or control that he's lost all will to defend or stand up for himself.

I want to be clear here that I'm ok with the characters doing bad things, being bad people. Especially given how awful their lives have become.

BUT

It is in this moment of psychological nadir: where Nyle is ready to suicide pact with Sarah; that the heroes' love triumphs and they confess feelings of love for each other. And then, less than 30 seconds later, they are blissfully plotting the life they'll build together while they absentmindedly trespass now with consequences.

And it really feels like the movie wants us to buy the Hollywood ending of happily ever after romance. Between these two traumatized, unstable codependent friends.

We never see their friendship exist in any other form than how they gallivant through the time loop and how they start to open up before all the bullshit goes down.

And while I do like them as a couple and want to see them succeed. The rushed nature of the second half of their relationship breaks this for me, and I really think that for all the plot beats the author planned 5-10 hours would do better to tell the story than 1.5.

There's just too much character development to work through between Roy, Nyle, and Sarah. Too much distance between the Nyle who survives inside the time loop, and the Nyle he will have to become to survive outside of it. And the core philosophies of the characters never fully clash in a meaningful way.

Yes Sarah takes action, and Nyle drags himself into coming with her and leaving his adolescent cocoon. But they never reflect on how they've changed, on what they want now. The brilliant fights they could have about their differing philosophies are skipped because Sarah doesn't really care about Nyle and will happily leave him. And Nyle will abandon his cocoon if he thinks he can find shelter in Sarah.

I love the work the actors did. I love the cinematography. I think that the first half of the movie was very well done. But the movie fundamentally lacks a concrete theme (Unless it's find your Irvine, which Sarah definitely is not). Maybe the theme is if you try hard enough to escape your guilt you can.

Maybe the movie wants us to know that sleeping with your sister's fiance is forgivable if you use it as an object less for him in why he should never cheat on her again.

Maybe the lesson is that you should stop being a man-child when the right one comes along.

I don't know but none of these themes I'm describing really address Nyle's Ennuie, or Sarah's historical behavior. We never get even a glimpse of why she drinks and sleeps around so much more than even she seems to like. We don't know what she wants but cannot have, other than a man who loves her and an exit from a quantum trap.

Groundhog day succeeds because at it's heart the main character escapes his repetitive life by committing himself to self improvement. It's satisfying because his struggle is relatable to the general viewer, who can also escape the repetition of their life through action and self improvement.

In Palm springs the escape is done through learning advanced physics and strapping C4 to yourself. Perhaps the mode of escape is deciding to commit yourself to working to escape. But the movie treats Sarah's studies as more of a McGuffin and less of a life choice she grows into. In the end the camera always seems more interested in whether or not Nyle will grow enough to go with her, than whether or not Sarah is a woman worth following.

I love so much about these characters I just wish we could have given them an ending that better explored who they were.

Questions I haven’t seen anyone pose yet. 

We learn Roy lives in Irvine and once in awhile will come to Palm Springs/Joshua Tree to find and mess with Nyles. And after his newfound acceptance of his situation, just spends the day in Irvine with his family. But in the original timeline he is at the wedding. So does he spend every day in his loop having to convince his family they aren’t going to the wedding they were invited to?

It seems like Nyles had at least considered having Sarah enter the loop with him. Why else would he take her so close to the cave to hookup that time? He could have taken her anywhere at all and we know the cave isn’t particularly close to the wedding. I think he was going to ‘propose’ entering the loop at some point. We know he says don’t follow me in here after being shot, but that was because she would have entered without understanding or ‘opting in’",hontcw

Even though time loop films aren't anything new, I liked the approach they took.
The colour/colour grading of the movie of great too.
3 leads really stood out in this film, casting was great

Slightly predictable at times but it threw in a few curveballs here and there. 

I'm excited for it to hopefully come to UK theatres would love to watch it again on the big screen.

fxuqejq,"Great film. Absolutely loved it. But there is one thing that I do not understand and it is driving me crazy! Someone try helping me out here, please.

When Sarah conducts the experiment on the goat, she says it worked as she couldn't see the goat the next day, presumably believing that it has gone to the next day (that is, November 10th). But why is this not the case for Roy? How is it that Roy could still see Nyles, when it is clearly implied that whatever that has been blown up in the tunnel goes to the next day in real life which is November 10th and doesn't turn up the next day in the time loop which is basically the same day, November 9th? Also, how does Roy hear about Sarah's theory?

EDIT: Another doubt that's driving me crazy!
How did Nyles get stuck in the time loop? It may not have been the point to explain this in the film, but I still really want to know.
Not just a doubt, but I've seen people going crazy over the dinosaurs in the end. I kinda have a theory for that. It may be a bit wild, but it's whatever.
They aren't out of the time loop. They're high, just like the night they got high and saw the dinosaurs.
But this is way too far, I suppose. It could have also been a cool ending to the film. Like a throwback to the time they got high and saw dinosaurs. Something like that too.

fxvpoey,"A good fun movie with a great first half and a decent second. 7/10

Two things I wish were different. One the conflict should have arose from Sara taking petty revenge on wedding goers (like her family she doesn't like) escalating into real cruel vengeance culminating in her hitting Roy with the cop car and Nyles telling her that hurting people in the loop may not permanently hurt the victim but that the loopers have to live with what they do and then the same fight ensures. Secondly, this movie pulls its emotional punches when it comes to how tragic Nyles story is at the strangest time. The campfire scene could have hit way harder if Nyles mentioned he's been in the loop longer than he lived outside it (40 years apparently) and that he's not even sure he could live a normal life again. I understand this sort of happens when he talks about living a life free of pain and poverty and not wanting to go back but still I just think it could have been better.

So of course Nyles gets bored in the loop and he has gone to the wedding countless times. To pass the time, he might start having conversations with people he normally wouldn’t talk to much, like the grandma. It’s possible the conversation got deep and the grandma mentioned that she doesn’t have much time left on Earth so she really has to treasure moments like these, because she won’t have many more.

So then Nyles is like, what if I told you there was a way to keep on repeating this day forever and not have to let go of your family. So then she agrees to go to the cave and get in the time loop.

I really hope they also told her the way to get out because even she might want to move on after a while.",hontcw

fxqz2x1,"My interpretation of the ending is that there is a multiverse, and each iteration of the day created its own separate universe. This has disturbing implications for a “rom com”. 

The end of the movie has Nyles and Sarah sitting in a pool on November 10. They’ve escaped the loop. The fact that they’re together shows it is indeed the Nyles and Sarah that know each other from looping. 

The post-credits sequence has Roy from the loop attend a wedding in which Nyles doesn’t know him, confirming that Nyles escaped the loop. 

But this also means that the Nyles that escaped the loop attended a different wedding than the Roy that eventually escapes his loop. Based on the prior scenes, Roy had stopped going to the wedding. 

So what Roy exists on November 10 when Nyles and Sarah escape their loop? It can’t be a Roy that doesn’t know them. The Roy in their reality at their final wedding skipped the wedding and received (and understood) a phone call from Sarah. But it also can’t be a Roy that knows them, because the Roy that knows them repeats the day on a loop, and didn’t escape with them. So is Roy’s existence impossible?

No. The only explanation is that each loop exists in a separate universe. Nyles/Roy/Sarah’s consciousnesses repeated the experience, but each of those realities continued. If Nyles and Sarah went and found Roy, it would have to be the Roy that knew them and got their call. He would think he escaped the loop despite not being in the cave for the explosion. 

The disturbing part is that means that every day that Nyles experienced created a new version of reality, which he simply failed to experience the rest of. There are many where he’s dead, where he’s ruined the wedding, where he’s done things he will regret the next day but didn’t think he’d ever experience that day to feel regret. Troubling!

The ending just... absolutely fell apart for me. The moment she started getting the quantum physics books out, a little part of me died. The way they solved the time travel issue was just lazy as hell which makes no sense because there was clearly a lot of effort put into this movie.

The other problem with the second half of the film is that the narrative between the two characters completely dissolves after their blowup. The story builds their relationship up to the big moment where the truth comes out, and after that moment you could hardly even call it a story... They just skip a bunch of steps and suddenly he's apologizing and she's like... ""Ok, I guess we can be together, let's detonate this c4 now,""

When Nyles nails the bullseyes in darts I assumed it was because he had a lot of practice during his previous loops.

All 3 scenes seemed to intentionally focus on the targets. It seemed like they wanted to emphasize all three of these scenes, so when I watched I assumed they were somehow related.

one thing that bothered me - after nyles find out sarah slept with the groom, we see several more loops where he does nothing, why does he not go in the grooms room to confront her?? idk maybe he didnt want to embarass her. 

also some questions about the mechanics of the loop though, if anyone cares to answer. so it seems like nyles and sarah are tied together - if one of them dies/goes to sleep, they both wake up the next day, correct? this is shown after their fight, when nyles wakes up multiple times while he is not doing anything, and we later find out it was sarah who kept restarting it.   
however, it seemed like there was one ""mistake"" during their montage of doing fun shit, where nyles is driving and sarah falls out of the car and he accidentally runs over her. cuts to sarah waking up in bed, but cuts back to nyles driving the car laughing about how he ran over it ?! didn't understand that.

fzl48hz,"  **Does the movie poster help explain the ending to Palm Springs??** 

I might be reaching here, but stay with me..

Take a look at the official movie poster for Palm Springs.

The middle: There's the infinite pool, which is where Sarah and Nyles reside.

To the right of the pool: There's a desert with a plane flying above it.

To the left of the pool: There's a sign with a goat on it.

 

Now, think of each of these sections as places in time.

To the right of the pool = November 9th.. This represent November 9th because of the image of the plane. Sarah and Nyles stole and flew a plane on this day.

To the left of the pool =The next day/November 10th AND/OR breaking the time loop. The goat sign represents this period in time. (Sarah steals and attempts to explode the goat out of the time loop. In this case, lets just say the goat gets out of the time loop successfully).

In the middle (the infinite pool) = This could represent unsuccessfully breaking the time loop - whether that's stuck repeating the same day again (this time on November 10th), or possibly *Death/Heaven/Purgatory/ect..*

It's revealed that the goat (after Sarah used dynamite to send the goat out of the time loop) disappeared and was no longer present in the November 9th time loop.

When Sarah and Nyles attempt to leave the time loop, it appears (or at least it seems) they made it to the next day. However, in the ending credits scene w/Roy, it's revealed that the Original Nyles (Nyles before his time loop started) was still present and did not disappear, unlike the goat. This could mean that the goat's attempt to break the time loop had a different outcome than Sarah and Nyle's attempt.

You could also look at it like this:

The infinite pool in the middle of the poster represents ""the necessary leap"" to successfully get out of the time loop. The goat was able to make it across, but Sarah and Nyles failed to make that leap, placing them somewhere/sometime else (possibly stuck in another time loop/or even death).

**So.. In conclusion:**

**While the goat successfully got out of the time loop, Sarah and Nyles did not. They might've made it to the next day, but got stuck in another time loop. This time on November 10th. That, OR they did not make it at all.**

My theory about the final scene during the credits:

Roy now knows that Nyles is out and he knows how to escape himself, so he finally gets his revenge on Nyles.

As for some light criticism, as usual with these direct to streaming movies I find the big conflict to be weak. I’m supposed to believe that Nyles is pissed of at Sarah for hurting Roy because “the pain is real” when Roy was torturing him. Make absolutely zero sense that he all the sudden as a conscience for Roy, ALSO none of them seem to be bothered by the pain at all like when Nyles just let Sarah crash head on into the truck early on the movie. 

If they came up with a better conflict to split the characters up the overall movie would have been stronger. The dialogue could have used some work too, I didn’t find the heart to hearts that inspiring.

I do still say it does nothing new. It boils down to the same thing as Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow, Happy Death Day, etc - in that ""improving yourself"" solves the time loop.

Niles improves himself by finally making a choice to make an effort at life, instead of coasting along with no meaning or consequences. ""The slacker finally makes a choice"" also is very common, which is another reason I say Palm Springs does nothing new. Sarah also improves herself, using the time loop as motivation to better herself and no longer be the slacker girl who fucks her sister's husband. The sci-fi resolution is just seasonings, just like the alien explanation of Edge of Tomorrow and the no-explanation of Groundhog's Day (I haven't seen it in years so I may forget how that ends exactly) or the crime solving technology explanation of Source Code, etc.

Not a bad movie. I just still don't get the hype.",hontcw

fyo0lkw,"I liked this movie. Cute, funny enough, and thought-provoking.

Would have liked to have seen them stick in the loop, especially when they were at the ""get away"" pool wondering ""What do we do next?"" But I can't change that.

What irks me is the inconsistency in their memory following the explosion of the cave.

Clearly, Nyles and Sarah remember each other and their experiences, as they are at this house in particular together, and they understand that the family returns the day after the wedding. However, in the after credits scene, Nyles acts as though he has no idea who Roy is, yet Roy knows who Nyles is. How could the memory of the Sarah - Nyles connection be unaffected by the cessation of the loop, but not Nyles - Roy?

I understand that this movie throws logic mostly out the window by not even trying to explain how this ""magical time-bending cave"" appeared in the first place, but the ending bothered me. 

Otherwise, solid flick 7/10.",hontcw

fxrqsao,"The one plot hole I can't figure out an explanation for is how Sarah kept managing to wake up before Nyles and sneak out every single time for however long they were on that segment of the loop for, potentially years and years.

* Does Sarah wake up before Nyles in the loop?
* If they wake up at the same time, Nyles never once tried rushing all around the house looking for her sneaking out?
* Nyles eventually figured out Sarah was in the fiance's bed, he never thought to check *that* room once he woke up?
* Nyles never once thought to stake out the cave all day, where we saw Sarah spent a lot of her time while she was pretending to have disappeared? He never thought to check out whatever local establishments were in the area, such as that diner?",hontcw

fxx9yt5,"Guys, i'm gonna be honest. I fully enjoyed the movie and I thought it handled all the time skipping very well. I thought the plot was good and everything was very funny and enjoyable. BUT the characters were kinda lazy in their development. Roy was okay in the development of his character. Even though he had only a little amount of screen time, he started out as a very vengeful man who hates his marriage and would torture, hunt and kill just to hurt Nyles. Then one day he finally feels what its like to slowly die and now he is happy with his marriage, gives up on killing Nyles and enjoys life with his kids? Seems too sudden. Cristin Militia's character Sarah was the weakest character arc. She starts as a woman who sleeps with her sisters finance, drinks too much, and hates her family, and her only motivation for change is that she keeps waking up in the same bed as her sisters finance. Sure this is traumatic, but she had committed this act before the loop began so really she literally does not go through any new challenge. One day she snaps into realization of her actions and becomes a String Theory expert and shows love to her family? What is her motivation to leaving the loop besides wanting to not wake up in that bed? What did she learn? When she first woke up she already knew that what she did was wrong, but this random spur of motivation came out of nowhere. It could be argued that it was Nyles love that motivated this change, but I disagree because in the final scenes she solidifies that she is leaving the world for herself and not him. I think that her drastic change of character isn't deserving because she didn't really learn anything. Nyles is well developed. He has been re-living the same day for an uncountable amount of time and he is stuck living life as a lone wolf who doesn't care about anyone or anything. Then after bringing Sarah into his world he learns to value sharing the world is what is important and life is about caring for others. In the end, he chooses to share his life and enjoy the little things. Idk re-reading this makes be sound like a woman hating misogynist, so please let me know where you agree or disagree. Thanks you.",hontcw

If it ended then, I bet it'd be in college and high school curriculums within the decade, that type of masterpiece..I have to believe the Creator knows this too and made a conscious choice to go with the ending most likely to earn more immediate success but I think it was meant to be over then.... I'm almost bummed out about it because when the screen went black I started thinking ohh shit does he have the balls to leave it like this like mind blown excitement was in reach...I mean, when the whole time, from her mentioning the explosion theory through to the cave explosion, I knew they weren't going to die and it wasn't going to end in the loop I'm sure everyone knew there was really only one way that would end...

It’s a scene not a lot of screenwriters would add, but because they did, it gave them so much emotional heft as to what they have both been going through and having that understanding of the struggles of being stuck in the time-loop forever. A comedy made me feel that existential reality!

That scene was so good. Maybe it resonated with me because I've been mid-life-crisising for the last year and my life has felt like a never-ending loop of existential doubt (doubly so during the COVID era). But it was almost therapeutic to watch Roy talk about how even a repeating loop of the mundanities of life can still be beautiful and worth appreciating. Simmons sold that scene so well.

I agree with pretty much your entire review. The only thing that I really didn't like was the kind of non-mystical way of escaping the loop. Felt a little too...""midichlorians"" to me.

**0-1, 95-100: Nyles Prime**

**0-90: Nana Prime (?)**

-Just happy to be surrounded by family at her granddaughter's wedding.

**0-100: Daisy the Bartender Prime**

-From what I can tell, the first three in the loop have hooked up with her at one point. She just sort of has her own thing going on.

**1-95: Nyles Loop**

-Does a lot of drugs, falls for Sarah, bangs everyone, drags Roy into the loop, falls for Sarah again, gets tortured and killed a lot by Roy, learns everything in the wedding, drags Sarah into the loop, tries to keep her there, drags Nana into the loop as a selfless act (this may have been earlier or later, but I interpret it to be post-Burrito scene), goes along with Sarah to get out of the loop.

**10->95: Roy Loop**

-Learns he's in the loop, loathes Nyles for robbing him of watching his family grow, spends a lot of time (until approx 85, when he's hit by Sarah with a car) hunting down Nyles. Is called by Sarah around 94, finds Nyles Prime at the end of the movie and realizes Sarah was right.

**70-95: Sarah Loop**

-Constantly reliving the trauma of the realization she slept with her sister's husband-to-be, which settles in the more sober and the more repetitions she sees of this item.  Mentions at one point that a selfless act could get Nyles and her out. Takes on the source of her pain and leaves at 86. Does the homework and figures a way out via Quantum Physics.

1. Two different speeches prompted two similar but different reactions from Nana. They were both nice speeches, I think she just complimented them. End of reach.
2. She probably knew she was leaving because it was late, the wedding was just about wrapped up, and heard her phone call saying she was bouncing.
3. Why would she also be in the time loop and not acknowledge the only other people in the time loop besides with a cryptic, sideways comment or two that could be taken several ways?
4. When she says ""I've been to a lot of weddings"", Niles says something sarcastic and insinuating like ""you don't know the half of it"" or ""we can only imagine"" and she doesn't remark on this.
5. She somehow found the location of the portal in the middle of the desert by herself and never communicates as such throughout the whole movie?

I think she just says poignant things because she's old and wise. Maybe even a metaphor relating memories/Alzheimer's/marriage if we gotta reach for something, but I really can't see how she'd be in the loop",hontcw

I was aware that it was a big thing being promoted on Hulu and that it had Andy Samburg.  I basically wound up pulling the trigger on watching it because Mike and Jay were reviewing it, so I wanted to watch it before I saw Half in the Bag.

I started watching it, and said oh, ok, I guess this will be a cute rom com with some absurd humor because Lonely Island.  Then the first desert scene happened, and I reflexively spoke out loud to myself in my otherwise empty room, ""Oh, it's Groundhog Day.""

Then I said to myself as I was watching it, internally, well ok, the twist is it's more than one person, so that's orig...oh wait, Russian Doll did that, and that's much better than this film.

So, really this film plodded along like the random dinsoaurs, and the only two glimmers of hope, which if they had been expanded on, I feel would have a much better film:

1.  Sarah studying Quantum Physics to break the time Loop.

2.  When Nyles tracks down Roy to his house, and you can see he has a younger wife and kids, how much more of an interesting movie would it have been if you had JKK Simmons as the lead, and he keeps waking up to the same day...but he ages normally?

Instead we got a flaccid Groundhog Day remake that wasn't that funny.",hontcw

On Niles's first November 9, the night he first entered the cave, Sarah had to have a normal day, so I'm assuming she woke up where she would have been after the ""original"" November 9. Same goes for Roy, since both of them were stuck in the loop because of Niles. As for Niles, the only explanation would be that the old lady that's stuck in there with them did something that caused Niles to be stuck (à la butterfly effect), which means Niles would wake up wherever he ended up on old lady's first November 9. Then either this goes on indefinitely, the old lady was the first person to ever walk into the cave, or the old lady is God, or something

Edit: so yeah they definitely wake up on November 10. Roy is different (meaning the Roy that never reset) if he never manages to quantum his way out of the loop, but is the same Roy if he does. So by the sheer size of infinity, it's pretty much guaranteed that everyone who was ever stuck in the loop will one day exit it, thus waking up ""together"" in the real November 10th",hontcw

Also, the reason that Nyles + Sarah ended up in the cave was because of Roy.  That was Roy's main purpose in terms of driving the plot - he was a variable, since he only showed up every once in a while.

After the post-credits scene, Roy resets the loop one more time so he can get the equipment he'll need based on the message from Sarah explaining how to escape the loop. He does so and escapes the loop, but in doing so he inadvertently leaves a trail leading to the cave. A drunk post-wedding Nyles from that loop stumbles upon the trail, follows it, and gets caught in the loop for the ""first"" time.

The daily loops aren’t even really her loops. Her loops are the loops of others. “Let’s see what this guy does for the next few millennia of loops”.

1. I subscribe to curvysquare's [thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/hp447m/palm_springs_sarahs_nana_is_actually_a_future/) that Nana is future Sarah, which would answer your question. But if she is a unique person then is the how really an issue? Sure, an octogenarian wandering into the desert from a wedding seems weird but not impossible right? Just the Wow of it is a great enough device for the story.
2. As the wedding was on the 9th and Nyles responds to the family freaking out on seeing the pair of them in the pool with oh they get back on the 10th, it suggests that the time looped Nyles and Sarah landed precisely out of the time box from the point they blasted out and have retained their experiences from their time in the box and thus can continue on the now linear timeline as they are. Uncertain what this means for the non-timelooped Nyles and Sarah. I'm guessing as Nyles had made light of multi-universes when referred to earlier and the fact that he's reluctant to cause too much damage to others in each loop suggests that this indeed may be a parallel or multi situation which contrasts the Groundhog day universe rules where we're to believe everything is simply reset. But as the how can be sticky in stories such as this it's better those areas were left as vague as they were.
3. I like this question. Yeah, why wouldn't a non time-looped Nyles wander into the same situation. I reckon he would. It doesn't break this story that he does though.
4. Yeah, I seem to recall that Roy being an distant relative tag along invitee and the fact he drove interstate from home leaves easy room for him to simply say to his wife. Nah, I'd rather stay here and spend the day with you guys.",hontcw

Well from what (I think) I understand, that version of Niles and Sarah broke out of that loop. But when we see Roy again a version of Niles still exists in his loop. So I'm guessing Sarah's research was correct and the odds just happened to be in their favor?

The one thing I thought about is Sarah said the goat disappeared after becoming unstuck. But if that's true why is there still a version of Niles in the loop when we see Roy?

I felt her final line about saying goodbye was the biggest hint of all.

Also, did anybody else notice that both nana and the guy in the swimming pool who fornicated with Nyles said the same foreign phrase? I haven’t rewatched yet, but it started with “Sh,” and it sounded middle eastern? not sure if that was a hint that either the two of them were supposed to be special and are both also in the loop, or nana is using that terminology because of the pool guy, and that’s her way of showing she knows the funny details and she is Sarah!",hontcw
fxubc6m,"Really like this theory especially if she returns back to the loop to watch Nyles and herself fall in love. I have another theory.

I believe the Grandma was in the loop much much earlier than the Nyles and Sarah we see in the movie. Even though Nyles and Sarah eventually escapes, we see that a reset version of Nyles still exsists in the loop because Roy comes back to Nyles who simply doesn't remember. That probably means the reset version of Nyles will go back to the cave again and the whole thing will repeat. So the grandma has probably witnessed Nyles and Sarah resetting and escaping the cave several times, which is why she knows that Sarah is leaving that day. The grandma mentioning her mother also died very young may simply be to empathize with her. TLDR: Everything repeats itself--there are several iterations of Sarah and Nyles going to the cave and escaping--and the grandma has lived so long that she knows exactly how the repeats go.",hontcw

If I had to make a head canon to it though, I'd say it's because no matter what day you enter the cave you wake up on November 9th of that year. Even if you entered before or after. So the dinosaurs went in millions of years before and woke up that day. As the for final scene it's either a metaphor or the dinosaurs also randomly died in the trillion loops while investigating the cave and they woke up on November 10th. It's all made-up science so that's what I made up.

Then you could potentially kick-off the entire sequence of events again, and all the loops they went through would start over in one even larger endless cycle of loops.

There would then be two alternatives; Roy ""babysits"" Nyles to make sure he doesn't enter the cave every night until Roy can himself escape. He would also have to make sure Nyles doesn't enter the cave on the night that Roy escapes.

Or, if Roy failed to do this for one night, he would then have Nyles join him in the time loop. Then you would have an ""experienced"" Roy in a loop with a version of Nyles who is new to the loop.

The way I've rationalized it in my head is the ""time loop"" isn't exactly time *resetting*, it's the three of their minds/consciousness/spirits/whatever you want to call it being pushed from the morning of the wedding in one timeline/universe to the next in a series of infinite but identical timelines/universes whenever they lose consciousness (which is why they can technically make it to the next day if they don't sleep, as seen when Sarah goes home for the first time and Roy's spending however long in the ICU, but then reset as soon as they fall asleep/die). 

For simplicity sake, let's say Niles is the origin point, from timeline 1. He is exposed to the cave, and gets stuck in the ""loop"". The next morning, Niles 1 wakes up in timeline 2, having taken over the body of Niles 2. The morning after that, he's Niles 1 in the body of Niles 3, and so on. He repeats this for x amount of time, and then pulls in Roy (let's call him Roy 50 from timeline 50). Niles 1 and Roy 50 then wake up in timeline 51, taking over the body of Niles 51 and Roy 51. This continues again for x amount of time, and then Sara (let's say 500) is brought in, and repeats the same pattern until she discovers the way out. Let's say that's in timeline 600. Niles 1 and Sara 500 blow themselves out of the ""time loop"", and continue their lives in timeline 600, but Roy does not leave, and therefore wakes up the next morning in timeline 601. The Niles he meets is then Niles 601, who was never be taken over by Niles 1 because he has been removed from the loop.",hontcw

I interpreted it as a ""loop universe"" and people in the loop universe aren't aware they're in it (unless they're conscious of it, like Andy Samberg and JK Simmons). So, once Andy and Cristin get out of the loop, they're living normally (past the loop day and out of loop universe) back in the real universe. The end credits scene we see with JK Simmons, that's back in the loop universe, but since Andy got out, the Andy in the loop universe is just like everyone else who isn't conscious of it, so he doesn't recognize JK Simmons because he's a loop person instead of a conscious person, so to speak.",hontcw

Which creates another paradox and that is what wedding actually happened? the ""first"" and ""Last"" wedding is different for the 3 characters.",hontcw
fxtyre5,"I didn't interpret it as a continuous creation of new realities. Under the assumption that the entirety of time is deterministic, as in everything that has happened or will happen has always happened and will always happen, I interpreted the loopday as a subroutine continuously running outside of the main timeline that takes a moment of the main timeline as input, runs that moment through the subroutine, and outputs the consciousnesses of tracked things back into the same moment in the main timeline that they entered. For our benefit it has the playback of how we perceive time.

So the subroutine takes a moment of the main timeline of everyone's consciousness as input and runs it through a simulation of the day, but all the data is lost *except* for the consciousnesses being tracked (those 'stuck' in the loop). For those that are tracked, it takes the output of the simulation and reinputs it back into the start of the subroutine rather than take the pre-loop consciousness from the main timeline like it does for all untracked consciousnesses.

When a tracked consciousness gets flagged to no longer be tracked (when they blow themselves up), it gets output back to the main timeline into the tracked consciousness at the same moment of the main timeline that it had entered the subroutine. The subroutine now takes their original consciousness at the pre-loop moment of the timeline as input again, which is why Nyles didn't know who Roy was in the scene, because it was using pre-loop Nyles consciousness again.

This allows for a few things. It makes it so Roy could be in it a million more years, but Roy, Nyles, and Sarah would still all remember each other from the subroutine once he decides to exit, because since it's deterministic the 'moment' of the timeline that the subroutine takes as input/output will always be exactly the same. So in the pre-loop moment of the timeline, they have no idea about each other, and in the post-loop moment of the timeline (that takes place at virtually the exact same moment as pre-loop), they will instantly have their post-loop consciousness.

The only hitch would be that it can only allow for each consciousness to be tracked once, so once a consciousness has been tracked once, it can no longer be tracked again in this subroutine. So once Nyles/Sarah left, if Roy tried to lure original-consciousness Nyles back into the cave, the subroutine would see his consciousness as being flagged as having already been tracked, and would no longer track it. So it would just take his pre-loop consciousness again as input when the day resets.

I can't think of any hole in that but if someone can let me know.",hontcw

At least that's what I'll be telling myself so I can rest easy. I liked the movie and am a huge fan of continuity and technicalities for time-loops+quantum physics plot lines but this movie hardly came out to me as giving much importance to the limits of its story, and certainly the implications of having a scene like Roy meeting Nyle #1 again in the movie's timeline.

fyo2dik,">Nyles acts as though he has no idea who Roy is,

Here's how I interpreted the Roy mid-credits scene. After Sarah and Nyles explode the cave, the aware versions of themselves are blasted into a different timeline. The version of themselves that remained in the timeloop timeline reverted back to NPC-unaware mode, while Roy, still stuck in the timeloop, retains all of his memories.

So the theory is, a person leaving the timeloop also leaves the old copy of themselves in the timeloop. 

However, this would contradict Sarah's assertion earlier that the goat disappeared after it got blasted out of the timeline. I think the writers got around this one with the questioning lines from Nyles to Sarah about what exactly happened to the goat, to which Sarah kind of dodges the question.

fxmw3py,"Yes, and as Sarah mentions she's a screw up and disappointment so grandma may just be expecting her to take off. I don't think there is any real evidence she's stuck in there. Nyles would have noticed at some point given how long he's been there.",hontcw
fxzv31g,"The way she says that ""now that you'll be going soon"" almost makes me think she's seen lots of other people stuck in the loop and also eventually get out",hontcw

fxlxv29,I thought that Sara successfully giving her toast tipped her off.,hontcw
fxuoz5h,"I also started thinking this theory, that the Grandma is Sarah many years later. She obviously figured out the Quantum Physics to get out, so I bet she kept studying that after getting out of the time loop. My theory is, at her old age, (Maybe Nyles has died from old age at that point), figured out how to go back in time, so she could go through the cave (which also explains how the Grandma knew about the cave, or why she’d even discovered it) and re-live that time loop, because that was where she met Nyles, the greatest day of her life. She might of also figured out it was herself saying “Good luck” to herself, and realized she had to be back at that wedding to say that to her in one of the time loops. I mean, if I figured out time travel like that, why wouldn’t I want to go back and re-watch all these scenes of falling in love for the first time?",hontcw
fxoo6iq,"This is what I'm thinking too. One of the theories about what happens during the explosion is that they come out many years older, to reflect how long they've been in the loop. What if the explosion just spit them out 30 years older, on the day that they 'escaoe'. So the grandma is old Sarah, and she knows that every day in her loop is the day they try to leave",hontcw
fxot9vp,Man that sucks... I’d love it in my collection.,hontcw
fy0ir0p,"technically it wouldn't have been their first day, I like this detail a lot, the day they were looped in was november 9th so what I'm guessing is they came back, didn't know if they were still in the loop or not, so they spent the day normally and went to sleep, waking up on november 10th. That's why they decided to celebrate the next day, they couldn't have known if it had worked on the first day",hontcw
fxxsvi2,Ya that was my least favourite scene. Totally unnecessary. They should have just faded to black and then revealed to the audience that they made it out through JK's last scene,hontcw
fxkrb5n,"In the mid-credits scene, Roy returns to Palm Springs looking for Nyles or Sarah. He explains the reason he came back to the wedding was because Sarah told him something important over the phone about the loop. From the way Roy talks, what Sarah probably told him was that she thought blowing herself up at the cave was a possible way out. Roy wants to know more.

When Nyles has no idea who Roy is, Roy realizes Sarah's plan must have worked. The Nyles that remembered everything is gone.

Roy's chances of leaving are 100% if he wants to, he just needs to blow himself up at the cave.

Now maybe that means if Roy did that and he woke up at home on the 10th he'd be able to track down Sarah and Nyles after they got out and they could all talk about everything.

I thought that might mean he could end up waking up in his own timeline where they didn't remember him, but who knows.",hontcw
fxkr2a5,There was a mid credits scene you may have missed.,hontcw
fxm006x,"If ""repeating the same day"" is a genre now, I think there's two ways you can do it.

1. Anyone who was ever in the loop at any point, even if they stayed a million years longer, or found their way in and out before the start of the story, all get dumped out on other side on the 10th as long as they chose to leave eventually (And everyone finds a way out eventually, right? Forever is a long time.)

2. When you leave the loop, you get shunted into a new timeline where only the people you left with remember.

Both are pretty crazy. Confronting all the people you were stuck with on the other side, except with real consequences. Or realizing only you or a few others remember what happened.

fyghkev,Maybe...mayyybe... The grandma started the loop,hontcw
fxlf2zl,"I don't know if that's it. I think we have to think about first: How likely is it that she got stuck in there? Cave is out in the desert, so it is extremely unlikely she went out there and got sucked in. Realizing other people are stuck in there with you, it seems really strange that you wouldn't tell them that you're also stuck. When you're looping the moment someone does something out of place, you'd know they're also looping. Andy has been in there long enough so that if the grandmother was looping, he probably would have noticed. She probably would not have copied her behaviour perfectly every time through. 

Sarah tells us at the beginning that she's a flake and a screw up. Maybe the grandmother was expecting her to take off, because she always takes off from those kinds of things.",hontcw

fxy66sn,"Also, from a dramatic perspective, the stakes are much lower if we have robust proof that the goat experiment worked.

Think about it. If we aren't told that the goat disappears, then the worst case scenario is they die and reset, just like every day. Since we are told the goat disappears, we and Nyles think there's a real possibility they will blink out of existence. That makes Nyles' ""I'm coming with you"" moment more meaningful.",hontcw

The only way I can see to interpret the ending is that there were (at least) two universes after they go back through the final time and blow up the C4. 

When Roy comes back the last time he’s talking to the original Nyles, who hadn’t yet gone though the gate and probably wouldn’t after the encounter with Roy. 

When Nyles and Sarah blast out of the loop they continue on to the next day, in a different universe. Which Roy would be in this universe I’m not sure.

I was worried I'd imagined it but I love that someone who didn't have as much of a long life to look forward to gets to relive a good day over and over again (and was probably eavesdropping on Sarah's message to Roy, based on what she says after, so now she knows how to leave when she wants).  Wonder how she got to the cave, though.  Just for kicks, I'll assume she went out there to kill herself rather than go back to face what little time she had left possibly wasting away (let's throw a cancer diagnosis in there, too, to really fortify the choice), discovered the cave by chance, and now gets to be as healthy as she is today and surrounded by family for the rest of her days.  Plus, as noted above, open bar/no hangovers!

I also think Roy's daughter's outfit is so extra because he realized he hadn't been the most attentive dad (talking about how much he wished his night bro-ing out with Niles could never end) and has started using his loops to spoil his family (so the tiara and pony go with the really nice tuna dinner he was making).

If nyles smokes meth and goes on a mission somewhere or when Sarah stays awake and drives back to texas, the others are just waiting in oblivion, unaware, until they wake up on reset.

Nyles thought Sarah had disappeared, but really she was just waking up earlier and efficiently sneaking out, for what could've potentially been years (we don't know how long they've been in the loop)? This would mean that Sarah naturally wakes up earlier than Nyles in the loop, because if they woke up at the same time, Nyles would've been rushing around the house looking for her. Also, when the movie revealed where she's been (a diner, the cave, etc). Nyles never once thought to stake out the cave all day?",hontcw
fzsyvcd,They can have different length loops that line back up at the start of each day.  For each person as soon as they fall asleep they are instantaneously sent back to the start of the day.

By the movie's rules, we know what happens when you regain consciousness: you restart the loop. But my day is still going. So what happens when I try to wake you up? If it's possible for me to do so, you would be waking up outside your own loop. In my reality, a version of you would exist that has escaped the loop. If it's not possible for you to wake up again in my loop, then I guess going to sleep killed you somehow? 

The movie sidesteps this issue by never really showing one character end his loop from the perspective of the other via sleep (as opposed to death, which I suppose is simple). The world these characters inhabit is not presented as other-worldy or supernatural (aside from the looping nature of time) and one of the characters going to sleep and essentially dying (or ceasing to exist, or whatever) would have broken that sense of realism.",hontcw

After a thousand years it might just feel like you are just being forced to read the same book over and over again even though you have it memorized. After a trillion years what you mind becomes might not even be considered human any more. To have that existential threat hanging over you even if you are only at the beginning of the loop would be very distressing for anyone that really thought about it. This is why it was crucial for Nana to be able to leave whenever she wanted.,hontcw
fzjatfm,Thanks! Yeah I agree it would make more sense for Nana just to pull people in and wait for one of them to solve it. Yeah also her having to pretend to do the same thing would be hard but she could at least enjoy whatever crazy thing they decide to do that day.

Think of it this way: Nyle and Sarah got out on november 10th, and from their perspective Roy will also get out on november 10th, regardless of how long it actually takes him in the loop to put together a way to blow himself up. He could stay in there for decades yet it'll still be like he appears right after Nyle and Sarah do. Theoretically there would be some weird overlap if Roy talked to the gun range guy on the same day he left too, but I believe that since this movie takes heavily from the idea of the observer theory that each interaction would be retained after the jump out of the loop",hontcw

fxv74l9,"It presents Sarah and Nyles (and Roy) as morally gray characters, which I think mostly everyone would be in this scenario. One of the first things Sarah says is that she drinks too much, fucks around too much and is looked down upon by her family. Nyles builds her up to be more perfect than she is, and that kind of reflects onto us viewing. She's never really shown any pride for what she did, and she knows internally how fucked up that was. She had to wake up to that burning stomach of guilt that same morning after for probably years. She calls the groom out on it, and then finally gives a proper speech (since she always had trouble before) and threatens him with the mic down. Her sister is an amazing person, and while she can't undo what she did, it would be even shittier to blow up her sister's wedding to alleviate her guilt and she's wanting to give Abe another chance at being a good person and good husband. It's not a perfect solution, as there ever won't be for that kind of thing unless you're just looking for vengeance, but a point the entire story touches on is making amends, introspection and acceptance. Tala definitely didn't deserve that betrayal, but in the end because of the time loop, while in ignorance to it, she'll have a husband devoted to her and a sister who appreciates her more. Fairytale ending? No. But in the end, it will bring more good into the world than trying to tear it down",hontcw

Could probably trace her back to the room, or at least get an idea of which direction she went when heading out.

He should know that her absence at the wedding meant she was very much still in the loop somewhere, but then again he wasn’t very concerned with the minutiae/logic of it all and probably just assumed she somehow immediately found a way out and left him there and went right back to nihilism.

We know:

\- Everyone, incl. the goat, wakes up the moment they originally woke up from a night of ""normal"" sleep (let's call it Point A).

\- Let's call the moment Sarah wakes up Point B.

Now assume:

\- Sarah brought the goat to the cave at a time later than the goat's wakeup time.

\- Then the goat enters the loop and starts at Point A for possibly many times.

Now, what if:

\- When anyone breaks the loop, they wake up once more at Point A, and carry on with a loop-free life?

This means:

>re: 2 I think it goes: Sarah already hated herself and now wakes up every day being reminded she is an awful person. The contrast between sleeping with Nyles (true love!) and waking up with the other guy is what finally makes it too much.

I really like the way you've reframed it because it makes a really important point about her experience in the loop and how it parallels the experience of guilt and self-hatred for normal people. Every day she wakes up and re-lives one of the most regrettable things she's ever done in her life. And it destroys her. She's reliving this situation literally so the audience can see it happening to her without knowing what she's thinking.

I feel like this could have been an amazing premise for a journey where she has to come to terms with and move past her guilt. Stop living in the past she can't change and focus on the future. And even though the memory hits her every day, she may not be able to stop it from coming up but she can learn to let go of it and move on.

sarah gets hit by truck an goes into 'timeloop box', nyles go to sleep at night or whatever he does (don't remember) but also goes into 'timeloop box' together with sarah. roy is in the hospital for days, when he finally is put to sleep, he also goes to the 'timeloop box'. now all the members of the timeloop is there, so it resets, nobody knows how long time they been in the 'timeloop box', to them it will always just feel like a split second.",hontcw
g11vywy,"Good question, I don't think the movie makes it clear on how the timing works. Hard to fault the writer though as multiple people definitely complicates things.

One way to simplify things would be to say that the loop resets for everyone at the same time regardless of how long their previous loop lasted. For example, when Sarah runs in front of the truck, Nyles and Roy's loops continue for longer (and I guess Roy the longest since he was in the ICU), but then they all awake and exist at the same time on November 9th. Any excesses/differences in the time length of the previous loop don't matter.",hontcw

fxrygqs,"In Sarah's video call with the quantum physics expert she brings up Observer theory, which lends itself to the idea that the looped universe only exists in that single pocket reality, and once it no longer has anyone living inside of it it'll cease to exist. When Nyle and Sarah leave, the loop still can't close because Roy is still inside of it. So on the day Sarah leaves him the message, he obviously gets it because otherwise, if the loop reset after she'd left, that call would never have happened. Roy gets the message, then clearly ends up at the wedding on another night since Nyle is now in default timeline mode. 

What's interesting to think about is that I believe the universe resets per person, not as a whole. When Sarah drives to Austin, that's a 19 hour drive from palm springs. In that time, Nyle would have gone about his day and either killed himself or gone to bed long before Sarah passes out in her texas house...yet they wake up at the same time as they usually do, despite it being way past that time from Sarah's perspective. 

Theoretically you could have a conversation at breakfast, blow your brains out immediately afterward, and have the other person go about their entire day and stay up as long as they possibly can. The moment they fall asleep or die too, the day resets. Except it already reset for the person at breakfast, who's experienced no time between the gunshot and waking up, and can likely continue the conversation immediately. It's super trippy to explore this subject.",hontcw
fxrv80t,"Hmm. That’s an interesting possibility. It would mean the cave portal is more of an “awakening” of someone living in the loop universe, rather than taking someone out of “reality” to cause them to repeat the same day over and over. 

Seems like it raises more questions. Who are the rest of the people? It seems that anyone can go through the portal. Is there a purpose to it, a greater lesson? If no one is currently aware of their looping, does the loop universe exist?

How do the people in the universe have memories of what came before? Are those false? If not, how did they get out of the universe that was moving forward and into the loop universe?

There’s no indication that happened in the movie, since we next see them on the 10th, but it’s possible. 

In that scenario, I agree it wouldn’t matter how many loops someone does. Since those loops aren’t taking place in a linear sense as “real” time also proceeds, Roy can experience more loops than Nyles and still join him for the one real wedding.

However this would also imply that in a sense, “true” reality doesn’t occur until everyone is out of the loop. Since Grandma has no intention of leaving, and November 10th happens, that would imply there are multiple realities. 

This would also imply that Nyles and Sarah escaped the loop but woke up on November 9, which they would think meant they repeated and are still in the loop. Having that be the one true wedding would suck.",hontcw

If Roy escapes in loop 301, and ends up in the same timeline as Sarah and Nyles, (if he was able to talk to them about the loop experiences), then it would mean there weren't a huge number of other universes also created.",hontcw

I guess I saw Nyles’ arc as more learning to care for another person no matter how tough. I saw it as Nyles learning that no matter what his present physical situation is, it is caring about the people around you that makes life worth living. Where Nyles still had room to grow in his first plea to Sarah to stay is that he still didn’t care enough about her to abandon the certainty of time loop life in order to be with her. He was still forcing Sarah to operate on his whims.

Furthermore you actually raise an interesting point with the physics thing. 40 years seem a little short. Say she learned as much as a professor, that's like atleast 10+ years of experience in the physics field for people that are already interested in it. For someone with no experience in physics learning it via internet; I would say atleast 15-20 years, but likely more. That's half of the time Samberg was in there, which wasn't established at all.

I think all the people and things in the time loop are stuck as a copy of themselves in that day - unaware of the loop and it is just an ordinary day to them.


Sarah brings the goat into the loop and if she was doing any experimentation to the goat, she would have noticed a few things. First, the goat probably recognizes her. Goats are smart and can be affectionate. Second, the goat would develop beyond just the one day - in skills and that relationship. Third - she blows the goat up and then she finds the goat the same way Roy finds Nyles - a remnant unaware of the loop. The developed goat ""disappeared"". Or maybe the goat did disappear and sarah thought ""fuck it! Maybe we can at least die"" since they were both pretty ready to end the loop one way or another. 


She rightfully assumes, as does Roy, that the Goat made it out. But she wouldn't know what ""out"" means past a theory. Maybe the goat escaped and reset its NPC version. Maybe the goat died and reset its NPC version. Maybe the goat got stuck in a perpetual day and now can no longer recover its memory - in a permanent unaware limbo. 


I dont think Sarah lied so much as as she was asking Nyles to take a 'leap of faith' with her. 



What I want to know is if Roy or the Grandma ever leave, and if they leave, will they sync up with Nyles and Sarah on the same 9th? Or would Roy sync up with a different multiverse where the in-sync Nyles amd Sarah never experienced the loop? That Nyles and Sarah left together so they get to share the same timeline. It would be awful if the 3 of them couldnt connect again. 


And just like GHD, do Nyles and Sarah exit with their millenia of amassed knowledge and skills? Would be pretty funny to see the aftermath of the day when they are suddenly inseparably in love and suddenly the smartest, most skilled people in the world.",hontcw
fyo8vr4,"That was how I saw it too. 

Its kind of video game rules: Nyles, Sarah, and Roy are playable characters, and everyone else is Non-playable characters (NPC). NPCs are stuck on the preprogramed schedule, but have behavior where they can react to the playable characters. But when the Nyles/Sarah/Roy end their day, the NPCs reset to their base schedule. In the mid-credit, Nyles/Sarah are now just NPCs (the original Nyles before entering the time loop, would have worn a suit to a wedding; he still wore a suit in the beginning as he was learning about the loop; then he transitioned to just wearing leisure wear as he gave up).

Why would he fall in love with a girl who fucks her sister's fiance and is an alcoholic? Why would she be shocked and judgmental when finding out that Nyle's gf was cheating on him when she woke up that same morning in the groom's bed? 

Nyle's gf is portrayed as a dumb cheating whore but Sara is exactly that and yet, Nyles blames the rest of the family and says that she's perfect. Makes no fucking sense.

She is kinda written as the quirky girl who gets the hero out of his bubble. She is so quirky that she can be entirely flawed and the hero still likes her cuz you know, she's crazy and it's so exciting and shit. Her wanting to get out of the loop does not mean that she's redeeming herself. She did it for herself. (Cristin Millioti did a great job though!)",hontcw

So what happens to Sarah at that point from the perspective of Nyles? Does she just never wake up? Does she wake up and continue on but as a different version of herself, showing that this is less a time loop and more just alternate realities, and the loop is really about their ""consciousness"" instead of anything else?

That would be evident by the fact that there is a ""different"" Nyles after they escape at the end.

I originally wondered if folks in ""in the loop"" but not ""experiencing the loop"" were mirrors of some other reality, but apparently not. Roy and (forgetting her name) Christin Miloti were brought in.

Ultimately, the question I have is about the goat. Goat was never, AFAIK, brought into the ""experiencing the loop"" category despite being ""in the loop."" They then blew up the goat and it disappeared from future loops. A ""NEW"" Andy Samberg, after blowing himself up, appears in the epilogue scene.

Since Sarah/Nyles are only there once, they'd never suspect anything different with her unless they observed her that day, which they don't.

The dinosaur night bolsters the theory that each loop can be a different universe with slight changes. They try to make it ambiguous by suggesting it's because of the drugs, but why would they both see them? It could be that universes are different around big events like them leaving, or being intimate for the first time where Sarah is aware of everything (dinosaur night). So it's a little far fetched, but maybe on the first escape night, grandma followed them which is why she is looping.

Also, do they ever say who she is? I thought we're calling her grandma because of age, but maybe I missed it. Her dialogue is too suggestive though, for her just to be talking about Sarah, they're definitely trying to suggest something since nearly everyone is picking up on it.",hontcw

The year that Les Miserables was closing on Broadway (Cristins senior year), a bunch of schools applied for the rights to perform it but only 3 were chosen/allowed and ours was one. The Broadway people invited all the senior leads from those schools to audition to be on the company for the final performance on Broadway.

It's supported by the fact that we learn almost nothing about his character during the entire film and that he was very, very clingy and not willing to leave.

So actually it could just be that it resets once everyone is asleep, and whoever sleeps first or gets woken up at any point is no wiser, because they're still unconscious when the reset finally happens.",hontcw

fyn09p3,"The only gripe I have is that the ending leaves time inconsistent.  Nyles and Sarah did their last day with knowledge of what to say and do.  So Roy is still stuck in the time loop, and his version of what Nyles and Sarah do that day (and what everyone else did, due to butterfly effect) is also different.

Or maybe: what actually happens that day is what would have happened if they didn't know about the time loop?  So they wake up the next day *as if* they didn't blow themselves up, but had a completely normal day previously.  In other words, there's a ""default day"" for everyone, and that's whats fixed in time when they break out of the loop.  So what they do during the time loop doesn't actually matter.

Also: I would have spent a few months trying to figure out how to game the stock market as much as possible during that one day before getting out of the loop.

Because she realizes for the first time that no matter how much happiness she finds in this time loop, she will always wake up to her worst mistake and hate herself all over again. The film implies she had a belief that her relationship with Nyles could outweigh that mistake when she woke up, but it didn't. She had a fleeting moment of happiness before feeling like trash when Abraham asks her to leave. She's not upset because she slept with Abraham, she's despondent because she knows waking up in his bed every day will mean she will always feel like a horrible person even if Nyles makes her happy. It will be a fresh wound for all of eternity, at least from her perspective at the time.

She literally had such a gasp on the topic when she was consulting with another physicist they said she didnt need their help because she fully grasped the concepts as well as they did. To become a master in the subject even if it is one field would be a tremendously difficult task to accomplish and would mean she has full understanding of all branches that lead to her area of interest which I would assume would take at least a decade to achieve.

Maybe it was his conscious telling him that he couldn't let this girl come with him to live the same day infinitely over and over, sometimes getting attacked by Roy, and he should let her live her life instead.  Or maybe it was something a little more insidious telling him that he could have this girl any day he wanted just by giving a speech for a couple minutes, so why bring her along for all the days where he wants to be alone?  I mean, what if she ends up hating him when she can actually remember him?

The moment when Roy is hold awake at the ICU, Sarah and Nyles are  asleep at some point (she dies, he just passes out at the party). So they are just waiting to awake until the latest person in that Timeloop box end their day (may it be death or sleep).

Ironically, you could say Sarah and Nyles (and Nana) where all in a coma while Roy was being blocked to go into a coma.

So, Nyles and Sarah get out, but Roy is still stuck in the time loop bubble, so it’s just repeating over and over in his personal timeline. And since Nyles/Sarah got out, the wedding versions are basically just like the rest of the NPCs who aren’t conscious of the loop (when Roy goes back to the wedding in the credits).

Granted there’s always issues with time travel/loop stuff. Like, when Roy gets out, he’s going to wake up in his version of tomorrow, but how many days after Nyles/Sarah got out will that be? Time travel stuff is always a mess to theorize about haha",hontcw

Speaking of scenes that maybe reference other scenes, I thought it was interesting that Nyles has a short fantasy sexual sequence with Howard, who is played by Peter Gallagher.  Gallagher was in American Beauty, which of course has an experimental homosexual sequence that gives me some similar vibes.  I'm probably reaching though.",hontcw
fy9fcrg,"It's implied she lied about that to Nyles to ensure he goes along with her plan. The goat definitely still exists but in my head the goat didn't recognise her when she went back so that was enough for her to risk it.

The lie was a little extra to convince Nyles.",hontcw
fy7rl0a,2. It’s a flashback from the scene with Nyles and Sarah in the pool. Sarah left Roy a message about their plan to give him a potential escape route the day she escaped it. This final scene is Roy arriving back at the wedding to ask Nyles about it (presumably at least one day later) and realizing that this isn’t time-loop Nyles...he’s escaped and the plan worked.,hontcw
fy7r44f,"1. Oh, correct. If we're assuming everyone else moves on,  then yeah, it would be an identical copy of the original Sarah. The OG Sarah would have moved on. Does that really make any difference though?

2. Say what?! She left him the message before she blew herself up. That scene was in the movie. She never ""traveled back"". She left him the message when everyone was still in the loop. So when he wakes up on the same day, of course he remembers the call.",hontcw
g0yu9b4,"Also, Nyles probably would’ve stumbed into the cave after seeing his GF cheating on him some time during/after the reception. It makes sense that Nyles would still be at the wedding early in the evening",hontcw
fymuapa,"2 pools...1 pool was at the wedding location where all the family is staying. the 2nd pool is his ""Get away"" house he called it. Cause its far away from the wedding and has no ties to anyone at the wedding. The owners of the house are gone and he never runs into them on the 9th. So he never has to worry about running into the owners of the house.",hontcw
fyv0d19,"Interesting point.

Sarah makes it a point that they behave ""normally"" on the day they are exiting the time loop, so they don't incur any consequences when time returns to normal. But the Nov 9th that Sarah and Nyles experienced when they exit the time loop is going to be different than the one Roy experiences when he presumably leaves the time loop.

I would say your first instinct is right. Most likely, Roy would exit the time loop into a different timeline where his version of Nov 9th took place. Sarah and Nyles wouldn't know who he is still, as the versions of them that existed in the film are in a separate timeline where their Nov 9th happened and, presumably, the Roy in their version doesn't know them either.

I like my personal theory that Nyles and Sarah are now repeating November 10th instead of the 9th, which gives them both what they want. Sarah doesn't have to repeat her awful morning anymore, and Nyles gets to be in a loop with Sarah. She doesn't ""get her life back"" as she put it, but none of the evidence in the film suggests that she actually wanted that since virtually every aspect of her life was depressing for her. If this is what happened, I think Roy would still be in a different version if he left Nov 9th and went to Nov 10th. Even he could eventually get what he wanted, to see his kids grow up, if he blew himself up enough times.",hontcw
fzcdlm0,">Or maybe the goat did disappear and sarah thought ""fuck it! Maybe we can at least die"" since they were both pretty ready to end the loop one way or another.

Completely agree with everything. Goats have a huge tendency to wander off. I'm guessing Sarah couldn't find it again and assumed it was ""gone"".",hontcw
fzp7lxo,"I find it interesting at the beginning of the movie the goat is just standing there in the desert, and doesn’t seem to be in his pen.

My thinking was this:

Sarah goes to the diner and studies every day from loop 500 to loop 600, Nyles looks around the hotel for her every day from loop 500 to 600 thinking she might have left the loop

Then, Sarah starts going to the cave to experiment from loop 601 to loop 700. Nyles gets depressed and mopes around doing nothing from loop 601 to loop 700, missing her",hontcw

And technically, Sara never cheated... the cheating one was the fiance, who you can call a whore too.
I don't think Nyles thinks she's perfect, just cuz he loves her or defended her doesn't mean he thinks she's perfect. He just thinks she's worth something unlike her family who thinks the opposite to some extent. Plus, he is also an alcoholic. She was shocked cuz... who isn't when they tell you their partner is cheating on them. And,she was never judgemental, that is when she told him that her family was embarrassed by her, which is literally the opposite of judgemental...
Also, I never said or thought that solving the loop was her redemption. I said that a positive thing was that she took the time to learn physics to solve the issue, which actually makes her not dumb. Besides, he also lied, literally from the beginning, and he's whore too (and there's nothing wrong with being one). She never needed to have a redemption in the first place, at least concerning Nyles. Plus she was in her entire right not to tell Nyles about how she solved the loop.",hontcw

He obviously likes to indulge, go a bit crazy if he can get away with it. Same as Sara.

He found someone more suitable to him than his other gf, whom he has spent years looping through her cheating behavior, so much so that it lost all meaning to him.

There is no redemption. He knows everyone can be shitty. He has been shitty too (albeit free of consequence) He says it to Sara himself that they are already sick of each other, but that that is ok.

Because he found someone that transcends the average moral belief system for him, instead finding someone that makes him happy. Warts and all.",hontcw

fy0crdd,"I think your take on Nyles is spot on, but I thought Sarah was more believable than you give her credit for. At the beginning of the film she seemed to be the type of person that would bounce from mistake to mistake and just move on, not really accepting or facing her actions. 

Then she's caught in the loop, and you're right, she doesn't care that she's waking up in the fiancee's bed yet. However, as she starts to fall for Nyles, I think she begins to realize what it's like to actually care for someone, and only then does she understand the magnitude of how she has betrayed her sister. 

Every single loop after that, she is forced to confront how horrible of a person she is, and I think that's a powerful motivator for someone who is so used to being able to ignore and move past all her problems.",hontcw

fxln687,It's a bit of a stretch but I take it to mean that the goat she took with her through the loop and was training disappeared.

fxuaj5j,"From the scenes that end up in Joshua Tree, it seemed more like they stumbled out of the wedding into the open desert of Joshua Tree, as opposed to getting in a car and driving an hour up Highway 62 to Joshua Tree to bone. 

Joshua Tree is much prettier than Palm Springs, in my opinion, so I can see why they chose to film here. But calling the movie Palm Springs when it's not set there at all was a strange choice.",hontcw
fxu5j81,"Nyles *constantly* tells Sarah ""pain is real"". It's the sole and significant exception to his entire guiding philosophy that nothing in the loop matters. 

Another thing that gets brought up, repeatedly, is how much dying slowly in the ICU sucks, which was his alternative option unless you think he could have convinced Sarah not to call an ambulance.

Nyles being too selfish to endure that just to be absolutely sure he didn't get Sarah trapped in the loop too is *absolutely* in character for him.",hontcw
fxu4ihf,Probably wasn't thinking straight and must've thought Sarah would run away from what looks like a psychopathic serial killer situation rather than straight to it.,hontcw

fxoggew,"No, because the “observer” is gone. Since Nyles and his memories were propelled out of the “box” into tomorrow, the Nyles in the box now wakes up as if it’s a normal day.

Her last day in the loop she makes it as perfect as she can (endearing herself to her family, admitting past failures, and essentially threatening her now brother in law to never mess up again*) so that on Nov 10th she is in the best place to move forward in her new timeline. Emphatic period

The mid-credits scene where Nyles seemingly 'forgets' Roy is another version of him (Nyles) who, along with everyone else who isn't trapped in the loop doesn't have memories prior to the day of the wedding as nothing after the start of that day has 'happened' in that timeline or universe.

They didn’t bury the hatchet. Roy just made his peace with the situation and decided he didn’t want to murder him anymore because his rage had subsided.

fyqa5ue,"this is about two days late, but i was lurking through this thread and I saw your comment because I had the same question. 

when i thought about it, the way it made the most sense to me was that while they may fall asleep, the loop doesn't start over until both of them sleep. this goes for death too. so like in one montage of them hanging out, sarah falls out of a car, and it cuts to her waking up and waving her arms and yelling because she just died, but then it cuts back to nyles and he's laughing. i took this to assume that it doesn't all reset for him until he'd go to sleep, along with the scene you mentioned.

fz3146y,"The reason season 9 fails so horribly is because we were never supposed to meet the mother. Season 8 was supposed to have the same finale with Ted meeting the bass player, showing a quick take of their marriage, children, growing old + apart, and death. But at the beginning of season 8's air there was such a push from fans to get another year eventually CBS got on board, then the directors and writers, then finally the cast. Jason was the last holdout which is why Marshall is only in half the season. It was rushed, written and shot in less than a year with next to no story bording and it betrayed what had defined the show all along, that it wasn't about the mother at all. It's the worst case of fans messing up an ending that I can remember",hontcw
fy0ctcs,"In HIMYM, she was literally written as the perfect character with 0 flaws.  She is a version of Ted that only takes the good aspect of him, and ensures the viewer *loves* her and believes the connection almost instantly.  It was very purposeful that she was sweet, quirky, and perfect (to the point of nearing ""saintly"" as you mention) because they needed to make the mom worth it after dragging it way too long.

IMO, that's actually why her death was even more problematic.  You made this perfect woman and you kill her off instantly when she didn't deserve it at all.",hontcw

She did it after spending weeks or months researching and coming to terms with her actions. She didn't need to know if Roy and Nyles made up. Then in the mid credits scene Roy says that he got her message which is why he even shows up at the party again at all.,hontcw

g03jrqo,I didn’t think so at all.  Old people and toddlers say profound things all the time and in movies are often an angel figure.  I think that’s what she was.  I don’t like to think she stayed stuck in the loop because that seems like a really bad fate.  I like to think she just was wise and aware but got out too.,hontcw
fzr8t5v,I don't think there's enough evidence to say that she's definitely in the loop.,hontcw
g1e6tuw,Yes seriously.  I find the way they read into it ridiculous and not based on real events in the movie; and ignorant of how old people are and also it’s weirdly infantalizing how they all think she’d be happy in a loop forever even though all the smart people in the movie are horrified by the implications of repeating the same day forever.  But I made a post on this using real examples and quotes and got ripped to shreds by people over their made up headcanon.   This sub just seems to take fan theories as canon that aren’t even based on evidence.     The person who attacked me the worst argued that “it isn’t NOT possible” and “you just can’t imagine it” which they thought somehow disproved my analysis of real actual movie events.

(I'm thinking super basic, like if goat see's bomb vest and runs away, test was a failure)
  
She said she didnt see the goat again but maybe that was just to help convince Nyles to go with her? When he brings it up again in the cave she does give a quick little quip to dismiss it right before they blow themselves up.",hontcw
fxrmj0v,"Yeah I immediately thought of the goat too. It's either just an oversight with the writing, or the goat just wandered off the next day because it's a goat and they wander off. I'm leaning more toward Sarah meaning the goat wasn't in the usual spot it's always in (due to time loop) because it got out of the time loop, so was just off living its goat life. Nyles was still at the wedding that day, because he always had to go to the wedding that day since humans have responsibilities, whereas that goat doesn't and didn't need to be at whatever spot Sarah found it during the time loop day.

Still sort of a little oversight in the writing, because even just looking at this thread, a bunch of people are wondering about the goat.",hontcw

When she first showed up I assumed she was in the loop as maybe Niles told her to come by, but when she came again she confirmed that she was on it. I'm sure there's a deleted scene somewhere (no surprise if it was a gag joke that he hooked with her during those flashbacks) but I think she was in on it and understood (I had hoped for more talk about ""maybe being selfless"" when in fact Andy threw away his life to try to be with the girl, and she was selfless in telling Roy about how it works to get out)",hontcw

But it would also make sense if she just stayed with her horrible person state of mind but after finally having a truly happy night, the fall from grace is so high that she finally snapped.

If the movie was presented in a bit different order of plot points, her finally coming clean with her sister after her affair had already long been revealed to at least the viewer could have served as her coming to terms with it and thus being able to accept Nyles' feelings, instead of happening for no other reason than to create suspense and hint at a shameful secret.
 The scene could have been so much more powerful. In its current state, it sort of feels like a completely insincere attempt at absolution (in the eyes of whom?.. God, I suppose) for the sole, selfish purpose  of escaping the loop.

Nyles & Sarah leave the time-loop, so when Roy interacts with Nyles it is the version of Nyles before he encounters the cave. 

The ""successful"" transition is all that matters. It doesn't matter what happened in the time loop, only the day that actually ends affects Nov 10. So that last day matters, it's just Roy will be in a different timeline. 

Let's say Roy went out and did all that stock market & scratch off stuff before blowing himself up and the cave. He would realize that money the next day. But in Nyles & Sarah's timeline, Roy would still be in Irving raising his family. This version of Roy wouldn't be aware of the time-loop either since his time-loop version of himself didn't leave into the same universe.

And falling in love with the only real person is the real deal then, and it doesn't make sense that after sex with your new lover, you feel guilty of something that is now irrelevant. It is forced. It is convenient that after the reveal to us, she changes. But it is not a reveal to her. She felt the guilt from day 1, and it should quickly go away in that extraordinary situation.",hontcw

Wow, lots of venom there.  I guess we know who else is a cheater ;)

What Sarah did was way worse than cheating.  I don't recall if she herself was in a relationship too (I think she was, prior to the loop?) but stabbing her sister in the back was unforgivable.

ETA I don't support murder either, unless of course they deserved it :) and I enjoy murder movies so why wouldn't I enjoy a time loop, cheater movie?

Roy is already looping he could fuck with him and bring him to the cave and start his looping. and then blow himself up after he gets nyles through. Next go around looping nyles will meet roy sooner or later and start him looping.


Nyles might have not blown himself up a few times with sarah either. He lets sarah go, and it works. Next loop he can bring new sarah to the cave and start it all over again. but every time he brings a new sarah into the loop it always ends with her figuring it out and leaving. So he finally goes along with her.


Lots of looping responsibilities to explore.",hontcw
fy0aho9,"no, leaving it not spelled out has nothing to do with sci-fi, it would reflect what Nyle's said to Sarah, he'd rather die with her than live in a world without her. He didn't know if this was the right decision, but he knew wanted to stick with her. We like these characters and the movie asks us if we too want to believe in Sarah and if she actually became a better person, that she actually tested the theory out to the the best of her abilities and isn't just being selfish again and wanting to leave the loop ASAP...

again the way this movie ends is also fine... just having them chill in the pool for those extra seconds is good enough stretching of suspense but then it leaves out the fact about what happened at the wedding after the fact... having more post credit scenes would have meant the movie was trying to get us to invest our interest in the other characters; except the movie didnt go all in that epilogue route",hontcw

There were two different November 9ths where someone that experienced it (knowing it was a loop) then woke up the next day on Nov 10, and there’s no reason to think that one is more valid than the other, such that Roy should merge back into Nyles/Sarah’s reality once he gets out of the loop (or vice versa).",hontcw
fxs1p49,"Right. I get for dramatic purposes why they couldn't have him explode in the cave with Sarah and Nyles (having him there in the background for the final speech would be distracting), but seriously, I wouldn't want to risk dooming a guy to an eternity in purgatory based on whether he got a phone message",hontcw
fxsosck,"I think the key here is to not think of the loop as a “real” anything. It’s a box that they are trapped in, existing outside the normal flow of time, repeating in a bunch iterations over and over again. Since it exists outside of time, it doesn’t matter what iteration you break out of to return back to “real time”, so it doesn’t matter that Roy’s November 9th when he confirms the way out is different from the November 9th when they blew themselves up: he’s still just trapped in the looping box.

The endless loops of November 9ths are basically “fake” November 9th’s, a weird feedback loop tangent that offshoots from normal space-time. If Roy blows himself up he’ll get thrown into November 10th - the *real* November 10th that we collectively experience together. It doesn’t really matter if Roy is in the box longer, because the rules of time don’t apply in the box.",hontcw

The way they did it... They're dead. If she's right, and you can force your body out of the loop with an explosion, well ok... Your body is now out of the loop, in a thousand pieces because you blew it up...

fz0o7gi,"I think to say it is trope trash is to reduce it to your understanding rather than give the film makers more credit than your understanding, and to try and engage with it deeper. Nyles character says something like ""Yeah I've thought about the infinite looping multiverse a lot"". The creators have. Have you really, or are you making the same mistakes Sarah is?

Nyles represents divine masculine that wants to escape life, and while stuck in his escape he sees it as meaningless. He gets to hold onto certainty, but also HAS TO completely disassociate from himself because he is alone.

Sarah represents divine feminine that wants to play in the game that has stakes and doesn't have time for false masculine BS. She wakes up smiling too, because she has found love there, but then realizes it's meaningless. It finishes her character arc because she decides to be a good person and in doing so is no longer afraid to play in the TRUE UNCERTAINTY that is the real world. 

\*\*This is a hard thing for a human being to realize. You must notice for example you have some certainty that this is Trope Trash. Certainty makes you feel safe, but it is always bullshit. Yet we have adopted it as a necessary survival mechanism, until the human mind is ready to face the absolute terror of existence.\*\*

Nyles goes with her because there is MEANING to going with her, and even though its terrifying to leave, its not worth staying in the numb emptiness.

It is an enlightenment myth. A cave is a place a shaman would meditate and grow in. An important symbol that shows up in our early human written mythology (example: Plato's Cave). You could even see them as attaining enlightenment to escape Samsara (the time loop).",hontcw

And despite her waking up earlier than him, he never finds her in all that time? None notices her car is gone? I mean it's not impossible but it feels like the time during that montage never really got taken into account by the writers.

But this really has terrifying implications because it means that there's probably another consciousness that wakes up and has to deal with all of their stuff they did.

I'd think we would not have been able to see Sarah and Nykes on November 10th if Roy created the loop after they left... Unless days somehow happen congruently inside and outside the loop, so Nyles and Sarah had to be out of the loop for 1 day in order for the Roy in the loop to meet a reset Nyles.

The whole Nyles speech outside the cave where she pointed out his grammatical errors was atrocious. One of many bad moments.

I appreciate your points about the illusion of certainty, and I completely agree with/enjoyed reading your symbolic analysis of the film...

PALM SPRINGS seems much more interested in using the premise basically as an extended metaphor about marriage and the day-to-day commitment of partnership, and the time loop stuff is in service of that. It simply has different narrative concerns than GROUNDHOG DAY, a completely different movie. 

And no, Sara didn’t “bury it down”.

Roy was shown to still be in a reality where Nyles and Sarah never experienced the timeloop.

He could have been running for a while before getting there. He was trying to get to the cave to restart the loop since he was in pain and (until he saw Roy walk into the cave) he didn’t want to be captured and tortured again. He admits to sleeping with her “thousands” of times. I don’t think he’d all of a sudden decide he wanted to bring her into the loop. He probably went through that exact loop anytime he wanted to sleep with her. The variant was that in this loop, he was shot by Roy. This is something he had no control over and didn’t really expect. Nyles never admits any sort of feeling for her prior to her getting into the loop. He also has no idea that she was in the loop until she runs out to the pool.

Sara is a different person at the end of the movie than she is at the beginning.
