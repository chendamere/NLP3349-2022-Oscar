go60ab6,"Lots of feelings for me.
She used to be somebody, a member of a community that treated her as an equal. We see her meet the family in the store and realize that she is no longer part of their community. She is someone they have whispered about “are you homeless?” instead of calling on directly to ask how she is. 
She used to work in a place that she was proud of. She used to have a home that she loved and in which she felt at home. Now she is pooping in a van while people knock. She is in constant fear of being told to move on. 
She used to own her space, it was her space. Now she is offered spaces that will never be hers. The only space that she can feel ownership of and be at peace in is nature, and her van. 
If you have ever had the rug pulled out from under you, and you look back on what you used to have, what you used to be, the silent spaces will be completely filled.",lnwuxa
go8rorq,"My favorite scene was when Swankie was telling Fern about all the amazing moments in her life that make her feel fulfilled. Her description was so vivid; she felt so alive. I was afraid she won’t be able to make it to Alaska, and almost cried when Fern saw the video she sent.",lnwuxa
go3bcdz,"I really, really liked it. What a beautiful little film about life, connection, the American struggle and how so many have been left behind/forgetten, and more.

This is my first exposure to a Chloe Zhao film but I will definitley be seeking out *The Rider* now (and hoping she's allowed by Marvel to bring her own flair to *Eternals*). Beautiful cinematography of sweeping landscapes, fantastic score. There may not be much semblance of a plot as we typically know it, but I was enraptured nonetheless.",lnwuxa

go46b5g,"I wasn’t sure where the story was going and I was waiting for some kind of plot twist but I’m glad that never happened. I teared up a few times during this movie and it left me thinking all night about it. Some of my favorite imagery/directing I’ve ever seen. Some of those places made me really want to travel the country just for the fun of it.

If you told me the lead actor was some random person off the street, I would have believed it. She did an amazing job and made the movie feel so human. It didn’t even feel like a movie is the thing- it felt like watching humans be humans. Watching what poverty and homelessness does to a person and how they cope with it. It never had any moments of “woah I never saw that coming” and I’m totally fine with that. Just human interaction and a look into a world that most people have probably never seen before. 

I give this film a 4.5/5 easy and will be watching it again. Amazing movie",lnwuxa

go60z6t,"I get that the movie is actually literally repetitive and thus can get boring to watch, but every scene made sense to me and the movie is absolutely meaningful— It’s about Fern learning to cope with the grief of losing her husband and old life, and more broadly it’s about learning to accept loss and still finding meaning and beauty in the vast expanse of the world. Every experience Fern has in the movie allows her to piece together a way forward from the holding pattern that had her completely disconnected from her surroundings. For her, the nomad lifestyle turns from an escape to an embrace of the earth’s small treasures and the transient beauty of the human experience.

Even though it’s like The Florida Project in that it’s about  “poverty”, I would say it’s more focused on the general concept of loss— loss of home, loss of loved ones, loss of meaning, loss of the American dream. It sort of made me think of synecdoche New York, just grounded in a ‘Florida project’ type world.",lnwuxa
gob3q89,I strangely am glad I didn’t get to see this in theaters and instead watched it on Hulu at home. What a perfect setting to watch a movie that makes you rethink the very definition of what it means to have a home.,lnwuxa
go5i8wi,"I've seen people be nominated for Oscars for far less than what Swankie gave us. I mean, even if this were the type of awards juggernaut that sweeps up every nomination it could plausibly get, I still don't think she'd be nominated. But her scene talking about the simple majesties of the natural world is one of my favorite moments on film in the past calendar year. 

It was such a small role but so unbelievably potent, and she stuck with me through the film more than just about any other aspect outside Chloe Zhao's direction.",lnwuxa
gocyjer,"I love the focus on objects in this film and how when you live a minimal lifestyle, the smallest things and the value a person puts into them can mean so much. When her plates that she emphasized early on break, it’s absolutely heartbreaking. The chair that Swankie gives to her is just a chair, but even after Swankie exits the movie, when ever you see that chair you think of her. The lighter she gives the kid and then when she sees him later, that's how she remembers him. 

Because of the value people put into these objects, scenes like Swankie selling her stuff and Fern being unable to sell the van are just heartbreaking. When Swankie sells something to a passerby, she says, ""my grandmother made that, so take good care of it."" This object that has a history and meant the world to one person, is simply just a thing to someone else, until they put their own value to it.",lnwuxa
goeu6xl,"The fact that so much discussion here is about the director possibly being rich and how that would exclude her from telling a truthful story is such a aharp indicator of the level of discussion had in this sub. Very little conversation on the storytelling techniques, blend of docu-narrative, performances by non-actors or elements of light and framing. Just...she's rich and didn't deserve to tell this story. Fuck cancel culture and fuck anyone who comes to this conclusion based on rumors and devalues a beautiful story with TMZ level gossip.",lnwuxa

goakpmo,"I didn't like it. It's clearly a good movie, but I found myself more drawn to the directing than anything else.

It almost seemed like a documentary. Using some real life nomads helped, I didn't know that beforehand but it seemed like they were telling stories more than acting.

The visuals are great, the music was good, and Frances McDormand deserves her praise (that scene with the alligator was my favorite of her performance).

But something about the movie seemed off for me, I found the beginning to be very difficult to get through and towards the end I started to appreciate the film, but it just wasn't for me.

Maybe it's my mood, my mindset, or my pandemic brain? It's frustrating watching what you know is good filmmaking in many different ways but just not enjoying it.",lnwuxa

go82aqt,"This film will really affect some and not others. 
 Beautifully done, Frances McDormand was amazing in her immersion in to Fern.  It hits on many different angles: grief, economics, aging, pride, friendships, hardships, and beauty.  It is a peek in to an alternative lifestyle.  Whether forced or voluntary, this film resonates with those in this lifestyle or those seeking options.  There are so many stories that can be told, this was just one.  It doesn't explain a lot, but the film is one of those where you can feel 'in between the lines'.    

I may be biased, I have been there.  Have met a few of the nomads in the film, they are exactly how they appear, good people.  Hit the RTR a few years back, just a group of real people doing the best they can while sharing experiences and helping each other.  I am glad the film touched on this in a positive aspect.  Although nomads often feel alone, there is community out there.  I saw the beauty in this film.",lnwuxa
goaxr5b,"There were several moments in this where I just started crying. It’s a deeply emotional film that feels like it can resonate with damn near anybody, and it does so by really sneaking up on you in very natural ways. When she’s saying bye to her friend Linda and they hug was just UGH. Really loved everything about this movie.",lnwuxa

gq1re1e,I wish I could have enjoyed it as much as everyone else did but just couldn’t get into it. Couldn’t shake the feeling that with the quasi documentary nature of the film this wasn’t more than a vanity project for Frances with some poverty porn on the side. Very compelling stories that I would have loved to see in a documentary rather than this film.,lnwuxa

gq1v09i,"I was really looking forward to this movie.  I love Francis McDormand.  The movie felt like it was almost a documentary.  I found that having all these real Nomads and their stories in the movie mixed around Frances McDormand's fictional character to be really off-putting.  Like after each shoot, Francis just says ""See you guys later, time to go back to my mansion"".   I just could not get over the fiction mixed in with all the real elements.

Also, I found the movie to be too slow paced and boring.",lnwuxa
gqri3ow,"Wow. It's so interesting reading all of these comments. I don't think very many people got the movie. Some of you see it as poverty glorification. Other seem to see it as just a woman down-on-her-luck by economic disaster, who finds peace by letting go of the past, through the storytelling lens of homelessness in American landscapes. But I didn't see any of that. 

I saw a story of a woman finding happiness. Its a feminist anthem. I saw a woman who has always been capable, independent and comfortable in her situation, no matter the situation, as long as it was a ""choice"" she actively made for herself. Its about freedom. She's always lived her life away from the traditional, ""rational"" choices. 

She left her happy family young and somewhat spontaneously got married, moved to a middle of nowhere town and lived out the majority of her life there, with seemingly few complaints. She wasnt starstruck in love, because that's not how most relationships work, and she's not that kind of person. She prides herself on self-sufficiency and likes to keep things simple - no drama, if you will. She made a choice to leave home and be this other person in Nevada. 

Then Beau died, and that wasn't her choice, and was the first thing she couldn't control. 

Her solution to dealing with that was to simply stick it out and try to maintain her life as best she could. 

But then the town and economy went under and that was also not her choice. The world around her kept taking away her freedoms, and her ability to be self-sufficient. 

And since she's always been a survivor that likes to get by on her own independence, she felt like her only option was vanlife. Which, at first, wasnt a choice to her (at least not consciously). She thought it was thrust upon her, that she was a pure victim in its decision. 

But as the story reveals, vanlife WAS a conscious choice she made. 

She was a victim of some things, sure, we all are, but living in a van was NOT one of them. 

She did have friends and family to lean on. But going to them would be choosing against self sufficiency, independence and freedom. So, she doesnt consider those options as realistic. She even had a potential love interest (a rich hot guy too, might I add!!) to make a life with, and a home on the pac nw coast to maybe grow old in. But she also turned that down. She was also relatively healthy, young and educated with a good work ethic and could easily get a job and rent an apartment somewhere else. But she never even considered those options. 

She DID choose vanlife. 

And for some reason, accepting this reality, seems to offend everyone. 

If you think she's a victim of economic evils, you're happy to tell the sad narrative of the aging nomads as a FU to capitalists. If you think she's an aging hippy or slack jaw yokel making bad decisions, you're happy to accept her choices as fleeting ""alternative lifestyles"" or bad choices that uneducated people ""make"". 

But really, she's just a woman doing her own thing. And guess what? It does not need a justification. 

The ask for it to be justified by her family, old friends, society, movie goers, etc is the very problem and the thing that takes her sense of freedom away. And the very point that the movie is making. Stop asking so hard for a REASON as it devalues her choices and makes her happiness seem questionable. 

People are trying so hard to politicize her choices, they're forgetting that its a movie about a person, not a situation. 

And to be clear, this expectation of who she COULD be and what she SHOULD do is what led her to think she was unhappy for portion of the film. Even she didn't realize her happiness was already available to her until she had the opportunity to make a CONCIOUS choice to vanlife, confidently. In other words, her situation never changed throughout the whole movie, but her perception did as her confidence of her choices to live this way changed. 

Yes, letting go of her past memories is part of this, but even without that whole plot point, her real catharsis moment was walking away from the free guest house and choosing the van and solo life. 

The film is consistent in showing this narrative. 

Its about being a woman that is happy being alone, as aloneness isnt loneliness. And peaceful aloneness isnt only acceptable for men living out their ""Into The Wild"" dreams of adventure and romanticism. As society makes it okay for men to make these choices. The movie even showed this as none of the male characters had conversations justifying their homelessness, but all the main female characters did in one way or another.

My other favorite depiction of this truth is Sparky. Sparky told a lovely story of her happiness as adventures in nature she experienced in solitude. She didn't go on and on about how you need partners, droves of friends, children, etc, or how she missed out on these things, or how she was rushing back to those things in her final moments. No, she talked about flying with birds while kayaking in Alaska and seeing a moose alongside the road. She and Fern were both the same. 

And that's okay. That's the moral of the story.",lnwuxa
go4fry8,I liked the first half and was into it until I realized it was just doing the same loop over and over again with different locations. Then it just became too samey and started to lose me. Like they got the point across I feel like pretty early then didn’t really know what else to do for the rest of the movie so they just repeated themselves to fill the runtime. It wasn’t bad but after all the awards and hype I just expected it to be better. But I seem to be in the minority so maybe I just missed something,lnwuxa
gobad6e,"Great film, very beautiful and very human. Felt like a documentary at times. I would have preferred a more robust score or soundtrack, though maybe that would have altered the mood too much.

goajyk0,"Couldn't disagree more with takes on this film as romanticising poverty. It is an optimistic film and beautiful in that regard, but I don't think it shies away from many of the difficulties that Fern and the other nomads face in their 'houseless' situation. Sure their predicament doesn't reflect and represent everyone, but in the specific stories it chooses I think it was perfectly executed. I really, really hope this wins Best Picture - especially considering its main contender *Trial of the Chicago 7* which actually does romanticise/Sorkinize history to a dangerous extent.",lnwuxa
go2txly,"A wildly beautiful movie. The shot of Frances walking along the big nomad gathering for the first time, sunset in the background and the simple score with just a piano and a violin (maybe a cello?) really summarizes this movie to me. Simple, beautiful, poignant, and real.

As someone who has considered van life, not due to hardships but more for the seasonal travel, I thought this movie really did a great job of showing us the pros and cons of such a life without wallowing in any sort of pity. Never really a moment where Fern was doomed or without resources. She struggled but was never threatened or left without the ability to go on. I thought that was nice, to not make this about one extremely sad story but more about the idea of nomadic people in modern day society as a whole. This movie is about Fern, but through her we see so many more stories. Some about people who wanted the freedom, some about people who were forced into a more economic lifestyle, some who didn't want to spend their lives punching a clock. 

We see Fern's ability to live this life in everything she does. How easily she walks away from the dog and from every opportunity to put down roots, how proud she is of her van which she always personifies. This movie becomes less about an economic recession and more about a way of life that is in no way lacking or unproud, despite how the rest of society sees it. And yet, we are constantly reminded that it is an economic depression that put some people in this lifestyle. We see how seasonal workers move across the country looking for gigs, Amazon paying for trailer park spots for them and in a way acknowledging that they aren't paying someone enough to live ""The American dream"". 

It's both a sad and beautiful film. But it's not sad in the sense that it feels hopeless or pathetic. It's sad in a sense that these people have to give up so much for their freedom. Their life seems almost envious to us as we watch them travel and see the sights and be fully independent, yet the movie shows us the small sacrifices like not being able to eat dinner and be vulnerable without someone walking up and peering in your window or having the luxury of starting a family. 

This is an easy 8/10. The music, the visuals, the acting, the very real people telling their real stories. This movie will live rent free in my mind for quite some time.",lnwuxa
goakgi0,"I highly recommend anyone who isn't aware of Zhao's work and is going into this under the presumption of the Reddit hive mind, check out her previous work *Songs My Brothers Taught Me* and *The Rider*. This is her style, she likes to focus on the smaller details, smaller communities, the little things in life. What she tries to do is not romanticise them, she finds the beauty within them while also acknowledging the struggles they may face honestly.",lnwuxa
go7fjqb,"No matter how much I like SF and big ideas in my movies something like this I’ll be happy to watch all day and would hope to see the 5 hour cut one day. 

Seeing behind the scenes footage they use a lot of non-actors in the scenes including some well known people in the community. I think this set the tone for the movie and forced the actors to *act less and be more*. 

I also need to give credit to the director. I usually expect movies like this to be more Robert Altman slice of life with introductions where the actors shine and a lot of heavy handed directing even though it’s meant to be a low key movie but you can’t get away from the director’s auteur. 

Another movie that champions this style is *The Assistant*.",lnwuxa

*Nomadland* is a surprisingly balanced look at the van living, nomadic life within America. It is hauntingly beautiful, beguiling and poetic while not sugar coating a difficult lifestyle.

Frances McDormand has become a legend. From her debut in *Blood Simple* to her iconic role in *Fargo* to her latest gritty, down-to-earth performance in *Nomadland*, she disappears into her roles like a perfectly fit glove.

*Nomadland* is comprised mostly of actual American nomads. If it wasn't for her star factor, McDormand could be mistaken for her real-life counterparts. She is mesmerizing in a few scenes where she flits around in gorgeous natural settings like an eight year old beholding these views for the first time.

The third act is a bit jarring tonally as it shifts towards scenes of a ""normal"" suburban life, which I'm not sure were necessary, but thankfully it was short.

Another fascinating real-life character is Bob Wells who apparently is the face of this lifestyle. While not an actor, he is so charismatic and authentic.

go3h29x,"I really wanted to love this movie but I think I was hoping much more for a movie about community, like the vibe the trailers give off, and this movie is actually much more focused on the self.

Swankie with her explanation of her accomplishments was a revelation. Loved her character and how she really lived in those moments. My heart cried when she finally made it back to kayaking with swallows nest.

gqsbit2,"I was earnestly surprised to see the criticism on here. I thought it was a beautiful thought provoking movie that made me think and feel a multitude of emotions through its journey. I just dont agree with the criticisms of this movie at all, although I can kind understand it. It is maybe a little long/slow towards the end but I think that chloe zhao wanted to really drive the point home on the b plot of the movie if you will. (which was ferns turmoil of nomadic life versus normal life). I didn't feel like it was poverty porn at all. Maybe it wasn't in your face this is absolutely horrible lifestyle but its pretty clear that this isn't a great lifestyle. I dont agree that it would've been better as a documentary, I feel like then it would've definitely been poverty porn. There's no conflict? Its a movie about the journey of loss. Its reflective, therapeutic. I think its supposed to be an ""empty"" movie to really exemplify the nomadic lifestyle these people live. Same for not being too ""invested"" in the side characters (although I was). Its a movie about nomads, they really just form summer camp esque relationships where they drift in and out of each others lives but intensity of the relationship in those moments are heightened due to their circumstances. Yea some of these relationships dont get closure, some of these relationships are incomplete, most dont get a happy ending but that's life right?

It's a quick read that was incredibly well researched (she lived out in a van with them to report it) and I felt it captured the story a lot better.

There was no depiction of drugs or addiction that I have observed in the nomad/traveller lifestyle, and no hint of some of the violent and crazy people that make the road their home.  For all of the personalities portrayed, there was little reflection on a large population of hitchhikers and runaways.  There was also no interaction with law enforcement or depiction of crime.

I've lived in a Prius on the road for the past 1.5 years and can say they did a good job hitting on the intricacies of the lifestyle. Also the scene with the lady talking about how she is going to die in Alaska had me crying from a movie for the first time in years.",lnwuxa

go6dm5l,"A lot of people are praising the movie for how it depicts poverty, but I think the true story is closer to what we saw in ""Into The Wild"" with Emil Hirsch.   It's independence or death.  Fern is poor after losing her long-time job, but she chooses to reject many offers of help from people she is close to.  First it was her neighbor, later her sister, and towards the end, David and his family.  So it becomes less of a struggle to survive and more of a decision to stay unfettered by ""roots"".  When she explains to Bob how her husband had no family, and she and Bo had no kids, the only thing they had was Empire.  And so when he died, she couldn't leave it.  Maybe the journey on the road was part of her need to release Empire and be completely ""free"" but I also saw it being a tragedy of her pride.  She'd rather live in poverty and constantly run to the next campsite than staying with people who seem to really case about her.  And sadly, this is painted with pretty sunsets and singalongs, and relatively harmless events.  I wound up having the same bad aftertaste like with ""Into The Wild""",lnwuxa
gos7qq7,"It’s like they’re rubbing our faces in it. They want us to suffer. Frances charachter is one of those uplifting stories about how a person has to work incredibly hard to achieve their miserable life. Yet they don’t ever really really hit how much her life sucks. Everything keeps on moving with a can do attitude. She never has trouble finding a job. She barely ever gets mad. She just keeps on trucking. So the propaganda works by showing you that your life could always be as bad as Frances. But she can stay positive, so maybe your problems aren’t so bad compared to hers. But also maybe this lifestyle is what she deserves. They paint her being a nomad as an adventure when in Reality it would be incredibly lonely and isolating. I hate this movie so much. But not as much as I hate capitalism. Also the scene where she goes “eeee eeee eeeee eeeeeee” pretending to drive the RV is one of the worst things I’ve ever seen. Just some rich lady pretending to be poor. They’re mocking us. 0/5 stars",lnwuxa

“Free life in the wild” - Into the Wild

“The crushing realities of post-crisis America” - The Florida Project 

“Everyone you see will come back to your life at some point” - Big Fish

It seemed like it wanted really, really, badly to be a meditation on something when in reality it was just old people in vans doing nothing and establishing nothing of interest. No conflict, no commentary, no real narrative direction. Just kinda aimlessly drifting from point to point in mostly silence. 

At least Into The Wild had a killer soundtrack and good visuals, and Wild (god awful as it might have been) had SOME form of central narrative. 

These characters we’ve seen a thousand times. I don’t need a film that’s half documentary half fiction telling me a story I’ve already heard. 

They did a good job casting Frances McDormand as.. Frances McDormand. Usually she’s the high point, when you give her something to actually work with. 

I looked forward to watching this flick for a really long time, but it was just a hollow, boring, meditation that didn’t tell me anything I haven’t already seen before. 

I strongly disliked the lack of narrative, which you don’t necessarily **always** need. But at least don’t make me feel like I’m watching a direction-less documentary.

gpt78vv,"Fern is essentially an emotional tourist who probably never wanted to be one. With Bo gone she is a POV that connects with so many people despite not really wanting any connection other than her selfish, if understandable, needs. 

The film deeply connected with me in that it gives the humanity of these characters/people the attention it deserves, and could be inspirational for people who may be at a crossroads regarding employment. Fern works her jobs and doesn’t complain no matter how hard it is, just so she could be in her peaceful van. 

One story related question though - was Empire a ghost town her whole life, or did it seriously fall apart after Bo died?

Is the cinematography purposefully blurry or did I just see it in a bad theater?

It feels more like McDormand is serving as our guide into this community, as opposed to some grand plot revolving around her. The cinematography really complements the realism of the people on screen.

Very human and really makes you want to live. Told with a lot of heart and empathy. A look into the lives of people whose story aren’t told too much. We might not share all their struggles but we can relate to their grief and pain as human beings.

Chloe Zhao’s tender direction with a great performance by Frances McDormand makes this special. Frances doesn’t just play Fern but becomes her. The beautiful landscapes and sweeping score are some of the other highlights.

go2w0a3,"So here’s my issue: the shaky camera, the clearly non-actors, the clunky dialogue, etc. It all feels so forced. I love a lot of stylized movies, but they seem real within the world they are set. Nomadland is a movie that is going for authenticity but ends up at artificial as a result all of its obvious superficial trappings. I trust that Chloe Zhao made the movie she wanted, but there has to be a way to tell a story about class in America that isn’t afraid of a little polish (Five Easy Pieces?). 

Take something like Never Rarely Sometimes Always—it’s an indie-infused movie that feel true to its story / characters (or if you’re going for a doc, just make a doc, like The Overnighters). Nomadland is concerned with realities of modern America but doesn’t seem like it ever understands it in any way but a surface-level manner. I’m sure this will be the unpopular opinion, but it just didn’t work for me.",lnwuxa

golmx8u,"I thought this was a beautiful movie. It really captured the stark expansive loneliness of the landscape in the American West. The way she and Dave at times would just pull off the side of the road, pop their lawn chairs and overlook some shockingly beautiful landscapes aligns perfectly with my experience driving around the west.

And then to contrast that expansive loneliness with the feeling of community and togetherness that the camp gatherings created made for a powerful effect.

And then when at the dinner party someone criticized Fern for, ""just chucking everything away"", it was SO EASY to jump to the same anger that she displayed. The reality is that she worked a whole bunch of jobs! Every other scene was Fern working hard at something. And often it was the kind of work that communities need just to continue to function i.e. camp host, cleaning bathrooms and so forth.

And again I want to give love to the beauty of the American west. This movie really put that on display.

Oh and when Fern's sister says ""you're my sister. I would have loved having you around all these years. You left a big hole by leaving"" it cut right to my core. I'm a brother who left home and lives far from my family and, damn. That line got to me.

When I finished the movie I thought it was decent but now this morning I think it was really beautiful. I love looking at the IMDB cast page and seeing no pictures and that most folks pretty much used their real first name. Not many actors in this, it seems, and that really makes it feel authentic.",lnwuxa

While I appreciate the gorgeous, elegiac cinematography, a very cynical part of me can’t help but see the portrayal as a little patronizing, like a kind of righteous exposé for the sake of art and accolade. 
I know the movie is meant to play out as honest raw real but it just feels like a pretty live action movie of an incredibly intimate documentary because it /is/ so honest raw real, especially when most scenes seem like they just plopped an oscar caliber actress into a cast of “real” people in their “real” environment (iambic pentameter ? really? the cinematography and themes are already undeniably pretty, I don’t need the main character to remind me with a sonnet. Suffering AND well-read? You, arbiter of taste, must surely empathize with her now if you didn’t already).  

I don’t know, maybe it’s bad timing and  I’m cynical and can’t look past my own shit (unemployed by a pandemic while many close to me have been killed by it while my state actively dismisses it— hate you TX ) and be annoyed by these monologues that could have easily passed as interviews of real people.

Hi, I’m Academy Award winning actress Frances McDormand, you might remember me from such films as Fargo, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Myself and writer/director Chloe Zhao hope that you see this movie and drop everything to go on the road because it’s fun, fulfilling, and most of all really easy. Do not do any research or critical thinking of your own, this is not a character sketch, it is part documentary, part call to action.

gplkpa8,"Loved this movie but there's one detail that baffles me:

When Fern is at the employment agency, the woman tells her to take early retirement. Fern explains that won't pay enough and that's true. It sounds like she might not have had enough years of solid, well paying employment to have earned a decent social security benefit. 

But she should have been able to claim her deceased husband's benefit. Many people don't understand that. If, for example your husband passes, you lose their SS benefit. But in reality you can claim the higher of the two. Not both. Just one, but you can claim the higher amount. 

Was she not not aware of that? It's not a well known fact. Let's face it, it's not something the govt. Is going to advertise.

Or maybe she didn't qualify? You only get that if you were legally married for at least 10 years.

gqb5eeg,"i wrote this on another comment on this thread, but i'll write a little bit here.

this film really really hit close to home. i haven't had a home of my own since 2009. since then it's either been: renting a shared room with my father, renting a room on my own, couchsurfing, group home or shelter or ....well , you get the idea. Except a car. Having a van ... that would be a mansion for me! See,  I don't drive nor have a license nor even have made more than $6,000 in any one time (And that was for a student loan)...so having a van to live in, for me, would be basically owning a home.

in my hometown, the rate of RV /Van/Car homes have risen up, in particular because an RV park closed down. Disneyland wanted their land back for another parking lot (Really!?) thus displacing an entire community of retired/senior folks who lived in their RVs. Many of them had to go live by the river, but the cities by the river shut that down as well. Now they are parking on the side of the streets, parks etc and that is also being made illegal by city ordinances. It stopped in 2020 because of covid, but even that small sign of mercy is being taken away. This brings up the very scary question of : Where are we, who simply can't  'make it' in society and must live in a car or van or RV or tent by the side of an empty lot...where are we SUPPOSED to go? Not all of us have the ability to work a 9-5 or even interview for a job or whatever. What are we supposed to do?  I know ""They"" would love for us to disappear (Local goverments, NIMBYs) , but there's really only one way to make people disappear and that is violating human rights and it's not a good path to go down if we haven't learned anything from the Shoah, from the Armenian genocide and from what is going on with China's Muslim minority and other instances of persecuting minorities in a society. 

I completely understand Fern's refusal of living help and preference to live in her van and that life. When folks offer help of their own volition, like ""hey you can come live here with us"" or whatever.....I turn it down. For a couple of days, weeks, maybe a month or two, ok, but that's the most. Even in this place where I've been the longest at a year and some months , it does not feel like home nor do I refer to it as ""home"" and only refer to it by the address. Ultimately, you know you are a charity case, you know you don't belong, you know they may be family or friends or even strangers, but they don't really understand . they have a house. they have a stable shelter. they may have their own struggles, but maybe not that entire loss of stability which really, really changes you.  And in a way, knowing you can pack up your entire life in an hour is liberating. 

You start realizing you don't just ""fit in"" with society's ebb and flow yet still depend on it. You start thinking ""Either I go homeless or off myself"" from living with others like that (as a charity case), that you take up space.  It's a really depressing mindset to be in and living by your own means , however possible, becomes preferable than living on by the charity of others.

this film was so well made. gave me ""into the wild"" vibes, even had a swimming in the water nude scene, was wondering if it was a nod to ""into the wild"" but it is als a trope. speaking of tropes, i'm glad this film didn't follow a single one , or at least the expected ones (such as adopting the dog and moving in with david or with her sister). that's the sign of good writing.",lnwuxa

I have rarely felt so little connection to a movie and its ""characters"" (yeah most of the ""actors"" are just real life people that were kinda tricked into playing in this from what I've seen), I was just genuinely bored and I didn't care about any of it.

I don’t agree with the ‘nothing happening’ aspect, nor the ‘romanticization’ aspect of the story. Although the blows of living a harsh reality were softened, it was because we started watching the movie while already accepting this reality. The people in this movie already made peace with their lifestyle regardless of reason.

go4vgod,"I really wanted to love this film, but I was quite disappointed.  Nomadland seemed to want to say something profound, but it’s message was muddled.  It lacked focus.  

Was Fern on the road because she was poor?  I don’t think so.  She had an incredible work ethic and she would have been able to afford a modest apartment in another Podunk town if she wanted to settle down.  

Was Fern on the road because she had mental illness or was suffering from PTSD after her husband died prematurely and they lost their home?  Maybe, but that was only hinted at, and if that was her plight, it was lost among the preachy sermons about economics and politics.  

Was Fern on the road because she was drawn to the freedom of living unshackled by a house and    a 2 car garage?  Maybe?  

Obviously, people and characters in movies are multi-faceted, but a well written character, in a character-study film, should have a “spine” or central thread that moves the narrative forward.  Otherwise, you end up with just a series of random scenes following a person moving through different situations with no clear purpose or narrative arc...

Did Fern triumph over something?  It seemed so, but what did she triumph over?  Poverty?  Mental illness?  Shyness?  Loneliness?  Amazon?  Grief?  Trump?  Capitalism?  Society?  All of the above?  It was too muddled to know for sure.",lnwuxa
gocvkmg,"NOMANDLAND is an underwhelming and listless film set in a world that would have been better served as a documentary instead of this hybrid docu drama. The film's thinly drawn characters suffer too from the lack of motivation, story and plot

Frances McDormand is a fine actor, but we get very little about her character or motivation to live in a van as a nomad.  As the New Yorker review points out....

*""Fern and David also tend to speak in one-liners, or, like the other characters, offer brief (albeit poignant, pain-filled) anecdotes that hit the motivic nail on the head and drive it quickly into its place in the script, explaining with little give or detail what traumas or difficulties spurred them to choose the nomadic life.""*

Also, the film offers a Pollyannaish view of homelessness that is now typical of Hollywood. We don't meet a single ""houseless"" person who has issues with alcoholism, addiction or mental illness. There is no chaos here. We see no crime of any kind. Everyone is just a poor victim of capitalism. All it took was one bad break and now they're living in their vans and cars.

godt1pp,"Something that I found incredibly fascinating about this movie is that it is based not just on a book, but a nonfiction book that's all about Van Dwelling. Frances McDormand came up with the character of Fern so they could have more of a narrative. 

Nomadland is an incredible film. I've become very leery of poverty porn material since it can feel so disingenuous and judgment but this is so not that. It's human beings as their most realistic as they all come together to survive. I so love that many of the Van Dwellers reappear within the narrative like the guy she gave the lighter to. I really teared up with the scenes about Swankee and Bob Wells. Even though no a whole lot happens within the movie, I was so compelled in the lifestyle that Fern had to adjust herself too.

This was such a perfect role for Frances McDormand. Like not everyone can just walk through a field, casually talking to people and make that feel real but she just 100% nails this character. She knows her life can't be the same after her husband has died and although she's happy to be with a community that understands her, they are not always there. Her crushing sense of loneliness is captured so perfectly like when she walks through some of the quiet towns at nice or even being in that arcade she had to work for. 

Joshua James Richards who did the cinematography also deserves so much fucking credit for capturing every aspect of America. It's fucked up, it's individualistic, it's a structure but it's also fucking beautiful in the way we can be with people and nature. 

It's definitely my favorite non-documentary film of the year and the movie I really hope that takes the Best Picture Oscar.",lnwuxa

I sensed the realism with the scenes of the non actors but I don’t think Frances Mcdormand really blended in. She was great, but it felt like Frances Mcdormand and a bunch of non-actors and not fern and the nomads.

gokt5u4,"Feels like if Into the Wild had a baby with Terrance Malick...but with nothing that makes either of those great. 

Not to say I hated it or anything but it didn’t feel like it had heart. It *watched* people who had heart and occasionally gave glimpses into the multitudes of people who are trying to find happiness in the world and photographed excessively beautiful places at the golden hour but...it felt empty. 

Like, it felt like it never gave a real thought to anyone except maybe Swankie. The rest just said a couple of lines of dialogue and Frances McDormand would give a small side smile or a wave and the scene would end. Either that or the camera would just wistfully follow along while they told Frances McDormand to go stand next to something or some backdrop and just think a little bit and hopefully the audience fills in the gaps of the enigma of this nomad. 

I feel like it would’ve been better to just delete Frances McDormand entirely from the whole movie and just do a documentary. Cause the movie felt...at war with itself? Like kept trying to make an inherently sad premise really romantic and like it’s something to...look up to? But she seemed resigned to a lonely life. 

And you can say “well you can lead the same lonely life living in the modern hustle and bustle” but this felt like she was running from it all but couldn’t escape that feeling. And it never really dealt with or did anything much with that central conflict. 

But I really didn’t care for how sparse it felt on content. Anytime someone would talk (besides maybe that one scene with David), it felt like it started the 7 second countdown for when it’ll cut away before anything could be absorbed. You can say it was being unconventional and challenging but I’d posit that it’s the exact opposite. It made it feel dry and afraid to *be* challenging. Just blurt out a few sentences that are vaguely uplifting or really precisely sad and do nothing with it and then move on. 

I feel like it was trying to hit the mark of trying to be a celebration of the tiny inbetween moments of life that Roma was, but instead of making everything feel grand and majestic, it felt small and empty. 

And not that it was ever unimpressive visually or anything but it almost felt understated in its camerawork. Almost like it took the awe out of the locations and made it seem pedestrian. And that tilt up when she tosses the rock in the fire for Swanky felt so abrupt and uneven. 

I don’t know. I wouldn’t say I hated it and it certainly was very different than most things made ever. So that’s commendable. But I came away from it feeling cold. And the last few scenes all felt like they were designed to be the ending shot but it would just keep going. 

The awkward tilt up for Swanky. 

The storage place. 

Wandering in the factory place. 

Wandering in he home and backyard. 

Then finally on the road. 

Like, it doesn’t feel right when you keep thinking it’s gonna end and take it all in and then it keeps going repeatedly. 

I don’t know. I was underwhelmed and would’ve been happier with a documentary instead of a pseudo documentary that would keep cutting away from the real life perspectives to Frances McDormand doing a tiny smile or a wave or a wandering shot. Or even just do mostly the same movie but from Swanky’s perspective since she was really the heart of the movie. 

Also, not that it matters much but Tumbling Tumbleweeds had to have been intentional reference right? You can’t just put the opening song of The Big Lebowski in a movie starring the wife of The Big Lebowski’s director and call it a coincidence. Right? 

Yeah I don’t know. 5/10. I love Frances McDormand but I really hope this doesn’t win best actress. Not when there’s been such overwhelmingly strong and utterly fearless performances this year.",lnwuxa

This movie choked me up and made me ugly cry! I felt Fern was loneliest during the scenes where she was at Daves’s family’s home. The idea of being loved and being part of a family was too much for her to bear. Same when she was at her sister’s home. Grief can have such an impact and sometimes it leaves you afraid of accepting love again for fear you’ll have to bear another heartbreaking loss. 

Also loved the Swankie storyline and hearing her tales of travel and nature, so beautiful. When they all started pitching rocks into the fire I couldn’t catch my breath from sobbing. It was cathartic in the best way!",lnwuxa

gqvsf2m,"This movie was amazing. I went through a period for 2 years where I was just bombarded with ""van life"" Youtubers and subscribed to them to see their rig and of course most of the time, they were done after about 3 months. But it was a whole big thing for a while, maybe still is... but I remember seeing tutorials done by a man that looked like Santa Claus, maybe the same man asked to do the part again or an actor that can do a good impression of this Youtuber. Anyway, it felt very contemporary even though it was set during the recession over a decade ago. I didn't feel any connection to it being 2008/09 other than blatantly mentioning it twice during the movie, and the absence of iPhones and iPads for which as ""nomads"", she certainly wouldn't have cared either way due to her age. She did at one point  have a home screen on her phone(android I'm guessing?) that gave her the message about the woman(btw deserves a Best Supporting Actress nomination but she probably wont get it cause she's not super famous) dying of brain cancer.

I noticed a lot of big instrumental music large beautiful backgrounds and then a very obvious cut to the super quiet next scene that in film studies is basically non-diegetic to diegetic sound with additionally abrupt jump cut which was obviously an intentional choices made by the director. If she had a Q&A today, I would like to ask her about those choices because they are obviously choices. Doesn't make me hate the film, it just makes me wonder what was going through her head. I guess the disruption and disconnection was a running theme for the film itself but that's just my opinion.

I'm glad not to see so many big stars as it could have been too distracting, you see Joseph Gordon Levitt but he's almost in a cameo role and I'm sure with his pull, he could have asked for something bigger but chose to be small but memorable in the role. I did look at Frances and think, omg she still has that cute ""midwestern"" accent that's obviously not going to be Fargo but I see glimpses of a very cute midwestern cold accent pop in from time to time since she's not playing a city girl.... doncha you know ;)

I was almost thinking when she was working for Amazon(which is why I thought this was more contemporary) she wasn't exactly treated like crap or anything, the employees and the supervisors are shown as pretty optimistic and decent. Maybe that's to suggest that over time, it got worse.

EDIT: I wanted to add to the ""I didn't see how it was 2008....."" well the Razr phone was a good hint it was from an earlier time period but I still see old people with older flip phones.... my dad literally had one up until 2020 and then he finally ""upgraded"" to iPhone 6 Plus

EDIT 2: Okay it is that dude from CheapRVLiving channel on Youtube.... I knew I recognized him! Super cool that he's in a big critically acclaimed film even if in short scenes.",lnwuxa

grqiegk,"It was OK. 

I definitely don't understand what the fuzz is all about. It isn't groundbreaking or original and while Frances McDormand's acting is superb, the plot itself isn't amazing nor is her character memorable.

Judas and the Black Messiah, Promising Young Woman, and Minari are definitely in my top 3 when it comes to Oscar nominated films (haven't watched The Father yet tho).",lnwuxa
gsl3a9j,"I’m on the fence with this movie. I thought it was very poignant. I also found it to be a slog in places. But worst of all, I’ve read that some of the real nomads they have in the movie were never made aware of who Frances McDormand was. They thought her name was Fern, and that she was trying to find her place amidst the grief of her (fictional) dead husband. The man at the end that opens up about his dead son does so to try to comfort this woman whom he thinks is actually grieving. I found that to be extremely exploitative, and I feel so sorry that he was manipulated into opening up about something he doesn’t normally like to talk about — all for a movie.",lnwuxa
gvbyjcn,"I feel like the odd man out with all the reviews and accolades during award season but I wasn't that impressed with this film to the point I'll be disappointed when it inevitably wins best picture. Really hoping for an upset this year.

One thing I didn't like was the Amazon scene. Not how everyone else is commenting about it but just the blatant product placement was distracting an unnecessary. The same vibe could have been given if it was a fictional warehouse. Someone on Twitter tried to make a point and compare it to how Cassie from Promising Young Woman works at the coffee shop throughout the movie but they kind of made an argument against the point they were trying to make. She didn't work at a Starbucks or any chain. The name of the coffee shop had no impact on the movie and didn't distract from the meaning of the movie like Amazon is for this one (the multiple articles and controversy online.) Some people even got a positive feeling about working at Amazon because she enjoyed it, said it paid well and looked really clean and organized (but totally misses the fact she still doesn't get paid enough to pay for the parking spot but whatever.)

I do feel like this would have been better in theaters. Maybe it had an unfair disadvantage there. The scenery was beautiful and I kept thinking how lucky Francis was to be able to film in those locations even if the movie was a complete bomb. I feel like the supporting characters outshoned Francis who didn't feel as authentic as them (which is hard to do when they're actually authentic) but for that reason, I'm hoping she doesn't win best actress. I'll be watching Ma Rainey's this week and I'm excited to see Viola Davis crush the role but I thought Carey Mulligan is also already a step over Francis.

Overall, it was OK. It made me want to explore out west and the universal grief message was somehow comforting. I'll definitely check out the book.",lnwuxa
gvubqta,"So from what I understand about this, almost everyone in this was playing themselves, most lines were unscripted, and people weren't acting, they were just being themselves, with a few actors delivering lines and playing roles to fill out the plot of this movie.

I never fell for the characters, the storyline was barely existent, and logistical errors everywhere (with working full-time or ss benefits). I don't understand McDormands character fleeing at the end. Are we supposed to gather that these are institutionalized people that can't live outside the van life? Bc she denied an escape from a shitty situation which I thought was supposed to be tugging at our heart strings. 

Whatever I don't really care. I won't be watching this one again",lnwuxa

My only criticism is it went on too long. Every time I thought it was ending, it wasn't.

go7i3zn,"Of Zhao’s 3 features, this one strikes a balance - “Songs my Brothers Taught Me” is, as far as I can tell, mostly a fictional story that draws on the present community; “The Rider” comes very close to being documentary; “Nomadland” lands in the middle. Francis McDormand is not the fictional Fern, and the things happening in her life, which is most of the film, are largely fictional - per McDormand, she really was packaging someone’s item, so I guess that was real. The story told there, I felt to be very effecting, if cliched. It works because of its feeling of authenticity, which in large part comes because McDormand is an incredible actress, but also because the fictional narrative is folded into another one

The real point of the film, I felt seeing this 5 months ago and still feel now, is the people she runs into along the way, the real nomads who became part of the film. Their contribution is what makes this one worth watching. How they live their lives, why they live them this way, the varying answers from different individuals. Even if the words they’re using are written for them, it’s very much motivated by the lived experiences. That’s absolutely what acting is really, so these I hope performances are celebrated just as much as McDormand’s. That these two linked narratives are depicted so lovingly, from very close up to just about as wide as one can imagine certainly helps sell the idea of a closely knit community that just so happens to spend a lot of time apart from one another; Fern spends so much time walking through wilderness, but to me it felt as if, even in that solitude, she was still part of the community. It’s not until she’s made to return to a “regular” life, be that with David or her sister, that a sense of isolation really seeps into 

I do think there’s a large portion of the audience (certainly so in this thread) who are looking to the film as some sort of endorsement or critique of the lifestyle, and I don’t think that’s really relevant - it’s not about what Zhao thinks of this community, it’s about seeing them as they are. At the same time, I think there’s a discussion to be had about McDormand and Zhao coming into the community as privileged outsiders, but everything I’ve looked at regarding this film and Zhao’s prior work says she goes about it just about as best she can - if it bothers you, it bothers you, but it doesn’t bug me

Anyway, it’s a great film, and I’m looking forward to seeing Zhao’s eventual return to smaller stories after Eternals (finally) comes out",lnwuxa

gpquh2x,"Wow. Such a poignantly honest and cathartic memoir on loss and the holes it leaves behind. Holes that swallow us whole. Holes that we then fill with:  Emptiness. Loneliness. Numbness. Isolation. Pain. 

How navigating the unending vastness of grief distances us from the connectedness of humanity and life around us. But how necessary it is to travel this unrelenting and unfamiliar landscape and to live in so many unbearable places accompanied only by our vulnerability and pain. How our notion of survival evolves entirely when profound emptiness has become us and we have become it. The abrupt confrontation of mortality that slowly grows into a consenting relationship with the comfortable certainty of death. And sometimes, even a renewed discernment of what it means to really live, as well.  

Nomadland transports us to places of isolation and companionship, existentialism and transcendence, and of life and death with a quietly nagging unsettledness that deeply resonates with we who mourn.",lnwuxa

While overall I liked the movie a lot, it unfortunately suffered from being overhyped for me. I *knew* this was going to happen... a contemplative and slow movie is more likely of feeling underwhelming from the hype, as opposed to thrillers that hit you with a bang. For example Promising Young Woman and Parasite, both massively hyped films I was greatly anticipating, and loved right off the bat. But even knowing it was going to happen didn't help my feeling of just feeling ""whelmed"".  I'm really trying to keep my expectations in check for Minari next week.

gt0bz4q,"You know, in a time when the “who” matters so much when it comes to the telling of stories and diverse inclusion..I think it says a lot that Zhao first two films weren’t based in China or with Asian leads, they took place in rural/Mid-West America. 

I imagine that has to do with her interest in westerns and “Americana”, since she spent her formative years at a private boarding school in the states, an education afforded to her by very rich parents. I wonder, just how liberating it must be to make a film and never be concerned with it making money because the stakes of failing and not making a “traditional” living will always be a non-issue. 

These maybe some of the building blocks contributing to the nothing burger that is this overrated, and uninspired “film.”  If it wins big at the Oscars...yeeesh. Having recently seen  McDormand play a grieving mother in 3 Billboards and then make this watered down spiritual successor, what a waste of artistic momentum. 

The lead characters are believable, the rest cast don’t really need to be directed because they’re all non-actors that actually live that lifestyle and the sets are the natural landscape.  I appreciate the aesthetic appeal of “less is more” but award this “film” the big awards would be laughable.

gqzpq7a,"You and many other people are IMO misreading this film.

The film was either not intended to be an indictment of the way modern capitalism ruthlessly and inexorably grinds low-wage workers under its gears, or it is a muddled, toothless, and ineffectual one that failed utterly to lay a glove on its target. I believe it is the former.  (Either way, it’s easy for me to see why Amazon was okay with being used as a location.)

Her argument against real estate was not about inequality but about being against putting such a high priority on home ownership.  She prefers the nomadic existence.

The source nonfiction book, as I understand it, does not have Fern as a character.  Her town ceasing to exist is to provide a catalyst to cause her to enter this nomad milieu.  She thus serves as an audience surrogate, someone who has previously lived a more conventional existence we can relate to.

No manager ever yells at Fern, asks her to do something she doesn’t want to, or screws with her schedule.  Nor do we see this happening to any other worker.  There is nary a mention of wages, benefits, or unions.  Yes, she is told no more work is available at one point, but that’s the point of the nomad community she then hooks up with: they show her the circuit, around the country, where different employers need people at different times.  She never goes hungry or fails to have gas money.

Two different people either talk about or are shown getting expensive medical care for major ailments, but there is no mention of lack of health insurance or difficulty paying for medical care.  One character seems to get all the care he needs, while the other decides to forgo the care because she would rather spend her last months outdoors living life rather than inside a hospital.

Finally, Fern has two opportunities to live in very nice stationary homes with people who love her and value her company (it’s not just pity).  Possibly three if you count the offer from the woman at the store.  That’s just not what fulfills her. It has nothing to do with economic hardship.",lnwuxa
gqb4l46,"""Now she is offered spaces that will never be hers. The only space that she can feel ownership of and be at peace in is nature, and her van""  


Truer words have never been spoken and this hits hard.  I was couchsurfing and other unstable living situations for almost two years (late 2017 - late 2019). even now where I'm staying, it's not home, I refer to it by the address. It's not home. It never will be home. And that's the hardest part about living with other people , be they family, friends or strangers. I've been offered places many times by college friends and while I have accepted , never something permanent and feel really weird about that because it's not my home in the end, not my people.   
You know you don't belong, no matter how friendly and welcoming people are.  Thanksgivings have always been the hardest, hearing a full family having a dinner and you are just in the guest room or backyard or something or go on a very very long walk to avoid any of that, to avoid being reminded that you ultimately are a charity case and don't belong. 

It is true. When I am out in nature, and whatever is serving as ""home"" in that time in nature, that feels more like my own home since loosing the apartment I grew up in back in 2009.  Many times since then, the thought of ""Homeless or end it all?"" has been a companion because ultimately, you find yourself in a society that has little or no place for you. Even among the RV folks in my area/houseless population....some are nice, some aren't , as is with all of society. When you can't even fit in with the crowd that doesn't fit in....that's hard. 

Didn't mean to write something this long or derail the thread, but this movie really really hit close to home.  In my hometown, one of the RV parks that housed many folks like you see in ""Nomadland"" closed because Disneyland wanted their land back for a parking lot. This uprooted a whole community, many folks had to go live out on the riverbed and then that got shut down as well. So then the streets get overtaken by RVs and tents, and now cities in my county are banning overnight parking. Where are they/we all supposed to go? This goes more than what a reddit thread on a film is meant for but the implications of ""where are we being pushed to"" is really scary.",lnwuxa

grp3nnv,"It's interesting you mention how the theme is about American struggle and being left behind because I argue it's the opposite.  It's briefly dwells on these themes, but quickly moves on to a meditation on post American nihilism. But the first movements are revisiting the origins of Americaland and the pioneer ethos.

The Great Financial Crisis, the backdrop to this film, devastated millions of American families, leaving a lost decade and millions left behind.  It's this backdrop, exposing the failures of corporations an institutions to take care of folks' basic needs that we find the protagonist.  It clearly shows how modern American capitalism is not working for so many.   Which is why the theme of nomads/pioneers underpins the entire film.  IT revisits the origin story of the Pioneers who settled Americaland and ushered in the modern social-economic system that continues to underserve millions. That idea is underlined by her monologue on the vast space between her former home and the mountains.  That expanse and pioneer migration to settle somewhere is her life now.  Importantly, it mirrors the migration of millions of American falling out of the middle class.

It looks at America through its breathtaking natural wonders as the New World again.  A new world to be settled with different non-corporate/American capitalist values.  An example is the frequent tension between private property where one can not park overnight and the vast expanse of the public lands of the Badlands, where you can quasi settle.

Lastly, it's a meditation on the values of stuff vs experiences.  Afterall, the protaganist literally abandons most of her stuff, but never lets go of her experiences with Bo.  So, I'll argue how she didn't resettle with her sister because it would be returning to a life of stuff.  The last point I want to make is that this movie does provide a line of escape out of American nihilism by showcasing ad hoc community formation and human first experiences around these decentralized communities.

Post Script.

If you replace Bo, as a proxy for the American dream, it will illuminate the subtext of the film.",lnwuxa

I think for me, it’s because Fern never really dead with the reality of what that situation would be like. In rare circumstances, the only true one would be when her van breaks down. 

Think about it. Living in a van, struggling for money? It’s not just working and driving. It’s scary. It’s hard. The movie didn’t need to show all of it. But as it stood, it’s akin more to a travel movie than one where Fern is actually living that life.

I thought, ""that was a colossal waste of time."" But I can't stop thinking about it. I actually created this Reddit account just to write this comment about it.

I guess I expected her to move in with Dave and have a happy life with him, because he clearly was in love with her. I wanted her to do that because I really liked Dave, and they made a great pair. I was frustrated at her reaction when he broke her grandfather's plates, because he just wanted to help. I was frustrated that she didn't go with him to his son's house, and glad when she eventually came by and was invited to live there. But the scene when she is going through the house alone, with all of the baby stuff everywhere, you could just FEEL that she it didn't feel right to her. That wasn't HER life.

I think what I didn't like was the constant anguish and loneliness throughout the movie. It certainly wasn't a stereotypical ""happy"" ending, but more about her continuing her nomadic journey with hope after she was finally ready to let go of her past.

You stated it perfectly - this movie is about her learning to be present. I thought the most powerful part of the ending was her returning home and letting go of all of her belongings in her storage unit, when in the beginning she was obviously emotionally attached to them, and visiting the home one last time before hitting the road again.

I could literally write an essay about this movie. I feel like I've hardly touched the surface of what I could write about it. It is just so thought provoking. I think this would be a perfect movie as an assignment for a philosophy class. How can I give a thumbs down rating to a movie I have picked apart in my head so much? I'll be going back to change that.",lnwuxa
gp1rqn9,"Yeah in terms of the plot it dragged on a bit, but I definitely saw the same kinds of symbolism here.

To me, I saw the nomads presented as making a choice to stay transient because being on the road, ironically, keeps them in stasis. “There are no final goodbyes”, just a promise that you will see someone again down the road. Those, like Fern, who are struggling with letting go of the past and are consumed with living in their memories find peace in a lifestyle where they can kick the can down a never-ending road.

Settling down on a plot of land, opening oneself to love, or holding a permanent job all represent finality and closure in some sense. But when you’re on the road there is always another stop. You can uproot your small footprint whenever you want to detach from life again, and your ethereal position doubles as an excuse to never get too close to anyone else.

Ultimately the nomad movement seems to be one of people moving ever onward in search of an Atlantis or whatever earthly paradise you want to think of. A place that will lift their burdens for them, even though that’s something you have to conquer within yourself.",lnwuxa

There was just something very cathartic in her journey, meeting these unique people and the really beautiful judgment-free friendships she forged with these nomads. In a year of mostly isolation, seeing those simple but honest human connections with the backdrop of some beautiful Malick-y American landscapes as she soldiers on through her grief just really got to me.

And from a technical perspective, my god was this film beautiful. Between the sparse music and the gorgeous shots of the badlands, just absolutely stunning.

go7bdn5,"Same here. There's a primal chord somewhere inside us that's struck repeatedly as this movie plays, maybe?

I'm around the same age as the main characters, so it may be that I recognize and relate to Fern's reluctant acceptance of the past and her stubborn refusal to change.

""I'm not going to quit smoking, Dave."" LOL

The scenery in the Badlands made me cry, remembering camping there with my kids and my 8-year-old son entertaining the other campers with his harmonica version of ""Home on the Range."" He's in his 30s now.

Like the character, I've lived a strange life that my family never understood. But it's my life. I so related to Fern feeling safe in her little space, wearing her New Years Tiara and celebrating all alone, relishing the freedom of being all by herself in nature.

I had a great loss recently, but my tribe (my family of choice and my kids) were there for days to just sit with me and be there for whatever I needed. I felt that sense of compassion and camaraderie that's explored in this movie.

Kids, it doesn't really matter in the end what you amass in the way of material goods in this life. A cozy bed, a 5-gallon bucket (or 2- or 7-gallon bucket lol) and people who care about you are all you really need in this life. Everything else you think matters will crumble away or be ripped from you.

This movie shows me that, even when capitalism has basically thrown us oldsters away as useless, we make our own way anyway. We keep on keeping on.

gr3hjzp,"I think for me, it’s the vast scale of the movie compared against the small scale of my own life. I’ve been working from home, eating from the same comfortable restaurants, watching TV and movies, and generally feeling like I’m stuck in a cycle. Being able to see someone interact with the world and all the wonderful, bizarre, kind, and lost people was both exciting, and felt foreign with how long it’s been since I’ve had a night where I went to a bar and just heard someone’s life story. 

This movie holds people and their grief at its center, and the storytelling of the actors and non-actors carries the movie for me. You hear about people’s pasts, their fears, their loved ones, their friendships. You see Fern interacting with their worlds, and her tiniest reactions show you how she feels about them. She didn’t like that David represented a new chance at love, so she got angry at him when he dropped her plates. She didn’t want to be left alone with the baby because it represented a fresh start, and she wasn’t ready to let go yet. 

I know it’s petentious, but this movie just made me think over and over again that this is the human condition. You meet people. You love them. They die. You’re left to wonder what’s out there because you want so desperately to see them again, so you mythologize how you might meet them again. And you just have to keep going forward while holding these thoughts in your mind. And the best part is that we’re all going through it together, and we get to tell each other our stories, and that’s what this movie was to me. Just people on the road telling me their story.

I am nowhere near as eloquent as you so thank you for describing exactly how I would have described it if i was able.

It's a relatively romanticized, Malick-ian look into their lives that focus more on the ""beauty"" of being homeless and a nomad rather than the grimness of it all and the structural causes the got them there in the first place. Odd how they even mythologized it by comparing being a nomad to the American frontier. It's a pretty well-made film that makes it feel real, but I wish people stop thinking it is actually honest. It's not all compared to something like a Ken Loach film or Agnes Varda's Vagabond.

Just because it doesn't explicitly call out some societal problem, or depict gruesome examples of poverty, or that it focuses on a character who has a couple people to lean on, doesn't mean that it's not a valid story to tell.

gr5cidu,"I mostly see your points, and do agree with them. 

Still, I think the film is too unrealistic in how it portrays the lifestyle. It presents a lens that I just couldn’t “buy” into. I don’t think it clearly shows that it “isn’t a great lifestyle”. It shows drawbacks, but plays to the note that these drawbacks are “worth it”. 

I didn’t need clear conflict. But I did need to see more to make this more compelling. Her choice to stay in this lifestyle, to reject her sister and Dave’s invitations, would be much more meaningful if we saw how challenging this actually was. It would show that DESPITE the difficulties, her choice was rooted in something profound. 

Throughout the whole movie, I don’t think she meets a single person who isn’t kind or nice. How realistic is this? I can think of one character, the 5 second appearance of the guy telling her she can’t park there. Everyone else? Kind, even if misguided a little. The woman saying it’s cold and there’s a shelter (you can sleep here though! Comes from a place of kindness). The woman in Walmart, not understanding the lifestyle, but offering to let a non relative to stay with her. Dave’s family, letting a pretty much complete stranger just live on their farm. 

This lifestyle would be so much harder than shitting in a bucket. It would be nights of no food. It would be constant stress about finding employment. It would be problems of health, etc. the only trouble she ever TRULY faces, when her van breaks down? I’ll just have my sister give me 3k in cash. 

I thought the movie was beautifully done, but it has a certain shallowness for me. It’s not honest to what that lifestyle would be, which wouldn’t just be “kind understanding Americans”, and “occasional difficulties”. It would be much, much, harder, which if shown, would make her decision to continue it that much more meaningful.",lnwuxa

go3jtqo,"A big part of the movie is examining (its idea of) late-stage capitalism, and part of that is the Stockholm syndrome of being super grateful to get a seasonal job that, for a few months, pays you well enough that you can afford to have a home. That's the secret horror of it: in the context of Fern's situation, Amazon is *good.* But in the context of human beings actually trying to survive in the lower echelons of hypercapitalist America, we quickly see how little Amazon really does for her.",lnwuxa
go2zyvo,I don’t want to be the defend Amazon guy by any means but I believe all the warehouse workers get at least $15/hour which is probably a decent amount more than the other jobs she had throughout the movie.,lnwuxa
go2z0m1,"In that scene she was talking to someone ""well"" off from her past that was obviously worried about her. I think it's clear that Fern does not want an attachment to anyone, nor for anyone to question or worry about what she's doing. It could have been fern wanting to make sure that woman didn't worry about her as opposed to the money actually being good.",lnwuxa
godvnmu,"I felt like Amazon was treated simply as another job they could temporarily work. I've heard that getting access to Amazon that closely took some real steps so they couldn't criticize it too much but I do think it stands as another puzzle piece of what Nomadland is. You have to go where there's work, even only temporarily. And you can adapt to the schedule but it's a lifestyle/workstyle that doesn't work for everyone. 

I think Nomadland would be a very different movie if its focus was about the terrible nature of late-stage capitalism and how it crushes people. The movie is more about Fern and how she uses this lifestyle to process how she's feeling.",lnwuxa
gocxdwi,"I was so curious about this too mostly because I was wondering if they actually shot in an Amazon warehouse or if they dressed up a different warehouse to look like it. Turns out, Zhao wanted to do it and McDormand wrote a personal letter to Amazon to get permission. Zhao basically didn't want to use the moment to attack Amazon, but to more show how this type of work (along with the farm and Fern's other odd jobs) are all that is available to people like her and it shouldn't be that way. She's doing back breaking work at the point in her life when she should be slowing down. Even if working the Amazon job isn't ""hard"", she is still someone in her 60's (with bad knees, as she mentioned) standing and doing manual labor all day.",lnwuxa

This really tugged at my heartstrings.  He passed and she couldn't bring herself to leave where they had lived together, even though he wasn't there anymore.  Then the town shut down and cut that last lifeline to him.  I felt this throughout the whole movie yesterday and am still  feeling it today.  Have been in that nearly-exact frame of mind.

I've seen people saying ""She had a chance to have another relationship with a nice guy, why didn't she do that?""  ""She had offers of a place to live, why didn't she do that?""  Because she's grieving and what she's doing is how she's working through it.  It speaks to me.",lnwuxa

I understand what the film is trying to portray, but it was so flat and outright boring. I desperately wanted there to be something more to draw me in emotionally, but everything felt detached. I get that is in a way part of the intent, but it was so incredibly boring I lost interest.",lnwuxa
gocvd7m,"I don’t necessarily agree with you about Fern’s intentions. I don’t see it as a tragedy. As she says at the end of the movie, her and her husband married young and he moved them to Empire and he loved the people and his job there. She sort of accepted this reality and made the best of it cause she was her husband’s only family. It made it seem like she regretted not having more life experiences so when the town closed down it afforded her the opportunity to hit the road, move on with her life to make new memories and to stop living in the past.",lnwuxa
gp5btzg,"I liked this movie a lot more than Into The Wild, which did leave me with a bad aftertaste. I never understood why he had to leave and what kept him out there searching. He was privileged and considered himself better than everyone and at the end it just made him, to me at least,  a pompous jerk (and I read the book, was hoping the movie would change my mind after hearing rave reviews, but no). On the other hand, Nomadland paints a much more understandable relatable narrative from all the characters who have a hole that is filled my constantly moving. 

I think I understand that her moving is not because she is ""better"" or ""discovered the truth about evil society"" like Into The Wild, but instead she (and all the others) move so that their grief can't consume them and that movement, no roots, becomes like breathing,  it is just normal and has to be done.  There is no pretension nor trying to convince anyone that traveling/tramping/vanlife is something everyone should do (and looking down on those who don't do it - Fran even trys to tell the young guy with the lighter to go back home) it's just what works for them and keeps them going.  There is no search for a solution (like the Secret Life of Walter Mitty - another movie I detest), meaning that piece that will fix everything, it's just surviving with yourself. I completely understand her reluctance to become a lodger in someone else's life, especially that late in her life. 

I think the sunsets are important to showcase that there are different perspectives to life and that one choice isn't necessarily better or worse. Did you go look at the pretty sunset today or were you watching tv or working or driving home or...? For these people the sunset matters,  for others maybe not so much.  In the end, they do their thing and deal with their issues themselves,  so they can continue to be self contained.  Maybe I'm just older now and relate to the Nomads but I definitely felt like I understood them a lot better than Chris McCandless/Alexander Supertramp.",lnwuxa
gr9xart,Which copypasta is this?,lnwuxa
go4ce83,"It's fine that it didn't hit for you but I saw it as someone processing through grief.  Both her life with her husband and city they built a life were taken away.  Due to our shitty system she could not retire or afford to live, and she was too proud to confide or rely on others too much.  That's why she finds this lifestyle it's built for people to come in and out of your life. When someone tried to get close she could just drive away.  The end she finally started to face and process this grief.  I enjoyed the film, but it wasn't her best work.  3 billboards and Fargo show her range. But still felt it was worth my time.",lnwuxa
goobzse,"Jesus, people really need to learn the beauty of silence in film. Some folks have a serious ADD problem.",lnwuxa
go52v4k,"I'm curious if you (and others here, too) are aware that [Nomadland](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a35538486/nomadland-fern-true-story-jessica-bruder-linda-bob-swankie-now/) is actually based on a book about real people, real struggles, and real life? 'Fern' is real, Bob is real, Swankie is real; [Empire, Nevada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire,_Nevada), is real, and so are the mining plant that closed and the people who lost their jobs and homes that were provided by the company. There are hundreds of (real) older Americans who, after working their whole lives, feel they have been failed by the system and as though have no other purpose, nowhere else to go. So they become Nomads. 

This film wasn't meant to be dramatic; it was meant to be, to use your word, a mediation on grief, confusion, loss, and, above all else, acceptance. These aren't just ""old people,"" these are humans trying to not give up on themselves the way society has given up on them. In addition—and you may not like this, and I'm prepared for that—Fern and most of her close (platonic) friendships are women; all the other movies you listed have male leads.

I will admit that something that irked me about the film was that Fern did, actually, have not one not two but three places and friends with whom she could comfortably reside, as I'm really not sure if that's the case for many real-life Nomads. I also didn't really like how she, in her sister's words, was ""always seen"" as eccentric; I'm certain that a lot of Nomads always lived and craved a comfortable life, and then became nomadic not because they love ""being free,"" but because they felt short of options.

That all said, this is a fairly niche film addressing similarly niche issues, so yeah, it make sense that it's not everyone's cup of tea.",lnwuxa
go397kp,"I agree. This felt like it should’ve been a documentary. The real people giving exposition basically to the camera was so strange and ironically felt scripted.

It definitely seems like it wanted to be deep but... what’s deep about it? Like you said, better films have handled these themes much better and many times over.

Also, does anyone else feel kinda weird that the movie, directed by an ultra rich foreign heiress, used real people talking about the actual struggles of their impoverished lives essentially as props to support a fictional character played by a rich and famous actress? A lot of movies are accused of being poverty porn but this one used actual poor people.",lnwuxa
go3676r,"It’s been a long time since I’ve been this disappointed and underwhelmed by a movie I’d been looking forward to and that was getting acclaim from so many sources. 

I can do slow, I can do unconventional, and I can do experimental. This was just aimless and pretty pointless. A documentary could have been fascinating and moving. This felt....like it didn’t know what it wanted to be.  

Gorgeous cinematography, but without anything even close to a plot beyond “Nomads doing nomad things,” it just felt like an art school montage. 

And the pacing was simultaneously sloth-like and too quick. Like, the “vignettes” or whatever they could be called felt like 10 minute movies that had been cut down to 2 minutes...while also feeling like 20 minutes. 

I’m truly baffled by the hype for this one.",lnwuxa
gojssd4,"I 100% agree! I felt unmoved because it’s a story that’s already been told. For me, it was not compelling. I didn’t care about the characters, in fact I felt indifferent and bored. The nature photography was nice. However, it is very familiar and not presented in any way that’s unique or interesting. Maybe someone who has never explored the inner life, connected with nature, or observed this strain of poverty and lifestyle found it moving. I don’t get it, I kept thinking “this is it?”",lnwuxa

It was just... empty. Like I was waiting for the plot to start and it never did, it was like a fake 'living a life of...' documentary. Sure the sunsets are great and all, but this film is just about nothing in particular and I was shocked so many here are praising it this high. Maybe it's an american thing and I have to be american to understand it, but I really tried to get into it and it just kept dragging. 90 minutes felt like 180 and I just realized I don't want this anymore.",lnwuxa

go5dsei,">  I trust that Chloe Zhao made the movie she wanted, but there has to be a way to tell a story about class in America that isn’t afraid of a little polish (Five Easy Pieces?).

I think that might be a main reason people have an issue with the film, but also that is maybe more of a viewer ""problem""? I certainly thought the movie was going to be mainly about class struggle in the US post financial collapse aftermath from the brief things I'd read about the movie and before I was familiar with the director's work, but I don't think that was the movie Zhao was trying to make. If that's the movie people want, Nomadland isn't going to deliver.

If you look at her previous movies, poverty and the harsh realities of the modern US economy are certainly the backdrops and parts of her movies, but they are not the defining elements or central plot points.",lnwuxa
go2yqkk,"Yeah, this feels like a film that would've worked so much better if they went fully into documentary territory. I mean many of the secondary characters in the movie are real nomads and I'd have loved a much more deep and honest look into their lives rather than Fern's.

Also, although it's a pretty different film, something like NRSA feels so real because there's a sense of anxiety and horror behind every scene, even with its moments of beauty (such as its moments of female camaraderie, which was very beautiful). This needed that, or at least a little bit more of anger.",lnwuxa
goduqzq,"I have no idea how you can call this movie forced. Like how do you even define ""forced"" in that matter when it comes to something that isn't highly dramatized movie.

The nomads are highly unlikely to pay ever pay their medical bills, especially for things like a bowel resection with primary anastomosis, as with diverticulitis. The life they chose has, without question, but it prematurely degrades their health, especially those ages. They chose to be unhealthy and risk their lives. The solution is not shame and rebuke.

So they'll surround the indie director with crew who have experience or can help with the action set pieces, VFX, etc. I'm sure these directors get a say, but the heavy lifting is probably handled by studio while the directors are focused more on story/character beats and the performances of the actors.

I could be completely, wildly wrong but that's just the sort of vibe I get and why you see a lot of the same crew members on various Marvel projects.",lnwuxa
gojsmuo,"At the end of the day, storytelling is storytelling. 

Sure, filmmaking is a lot more complicated than that, and there are some inherent differences between big budget sci-fi epics and down to earth character studies. 

But that’s where the benefit of the studio comes in. Zhao will have access to Feige and the Marvel machine. They can help her with the things she’s unfamiliar with, and she brings a new vision to their studio. As long as she’s got a story in mind, I’m sure she knows how to tell it.",lnwuxa
gomgk5d,"Chloe Zhao actually sought out Marvel, not the other way around. She's a big fan of manga and saw Eternals as her chance to make something in that vein. And yeah, Marvel loves hiring lesser known directors as they can be more easily controlled and they're cheap. Whatever lack of experience they have in directing big action set pieces is made up for with an experienced 1st AD, who often do these scenes.

Steven Spielberg saw Colin Trevorrow's indie movie and liked it. I think he saw Colin as a young version of himself so Hollywood being Hollywood, he took him under his wing and picked him to direct Jurassic World. Again, that movie's 1st AD is very experienced with these kinds of movies and no doubt did a lot of the heavy lifting. The 1st AD is really the unsung hero of these big action movies while all the glory goes to the main director.",lnwuxa

Initially I didn’t love it and sort of thought of it as an art house film gone too long. The redundancy, the lack of dialogue, the lack of plot. I wanted that happy ending where she went and lived happily ever after with Dave, but that wouldn’t have been right. The more I think about it it’s really about her working through her grief, not only of her husband but of her town and community. And the inclusion of real nomads was wonderfully loving, and it just really made me think about how we treat older people in our society especially those who don’t have that much money. Especially the part with swanky oh my god that part killed me.",lnwuxa
grp9x4k,"What I find really interesting about the movie, and what I keep thinking about, is considering whether or not what she learns is actually beneficial for her. She learns to let go of her possessions and attachments - both lessons that can be seen as positive. But she does so by isolating herself from people who care about her, hurting them in the process and reinforcing her internal narrative that she is independent and doesn’t need anyone. Meanwhile the film shows us over and over again that we need other people in our lives or we’ll get lost - quite literally in the scene where Ferg goes out in the rocks and Dave has to find her and bring her back. Ferg is frequently relying on the goodwill of others to get by (and in turn helping others as well). 

She’s able to finally deal with her grief, but I’m not sure if she’s learned to live in the present. I’d argue she’s afraid to live in the moment and instead runs from it. Menial labor, traveling, and survival are distractions she gives herself so that she doesn’t have to deal with herself as a person, her own flaws, and the difficulty she has maintaining meaningful relationships. I think there’s an argument that this movie glorifies the nomadic lifestyle, but I actually think it does the opposite. It really shows how isolating it can be, and I think that, like Dave, she’d ultimately have been happier if she settled down surrounded by people who loved and cared about her. It would be harder for her, and she’d have to put real, emotional work into it in order for it to work out, but she’d be happier for it.",lnwuxa

Mortality is coming fast for most of them and they've learned to recognize, for the most part, that not everything in their lives is going to get fixed and reach a pat conclusion (it's true for all of us). Rather they will live on coping with grief, regret, illness and pain and just make do. This was the crux of the conversation with Fern and the Van Guru. Living a nomadic lifestyle may be an incomplete or inadquate coping mechanism from some point of view but there's obviously a lot of value in it and it's just good enough of a salve to keep people going.",lnwuxa

You just need one that barely works. And if you have a community you can find anything that just barely works and be just fine, maybe even happy for a little while. One nomad's trash is another's treasure, and Fran grabbed a small treasure from the pile of junk.

this breaks my heart. seeing the senior community of van lifers also made me sad. i mean, it is awesome they have been able to make their own community but that saying is true: how we treat our most vulnerable says everything about a society (animals, children and elders).  what does it say about the US if we have our seniors living in RVs and vans or in a nursing home? what does it say about society in general that there are those of us who are just as ""cast off"" because we can't contribute to the rat race?",lnwuxa

go4co37,Loved the movie and disagree with folks saying she “chose” to be a nomad so it didn’t count or something? After her first stint at Amazon I thought they made it pretty clear she couldn’t afford to continue living there and there was no work for her.  Then when her van broke down she didn’t have $2400 to fix it.  She was in severe poverty and living with her sister permanently in my mind was never a real option - most siblings are not going to just move in and disrupt someone else’s life like that.  Fern didn’t want to be infantilized like that.  So she had a crappy van and no money... and somehow she isn’t poor enough for you?  As far as it not being grim enough I think it was plenty grim and was really glad they didn’t go down the road of Fern being attacked or something like that.,lnwuxa
go34p7t,"I have no idea how realistic the movie was, but I didn't take it as romanticizing the lifestyle. The loneliness and grief were more prominent to me.

I guess that's just my perspective. I thought it'd be a great double feature with Vagabond.",lnwuxa
go2w47a,"To be fair, the movie makes a specific point to differentiate between ""homeless"" and ""houseless"", but I think the overall point was not only to point out that some people were forced into the lifestyle but also to point out that it's not a lifestyle that's devoid of pride or joy. Making this too much of a sob story or focusing on how hard their lives are wouldn't have had the same impact as just showing it as an alternative lifestyle, regardless of the economic forces at work.",lnwuxa

There's beauty in the surroundings but it's also desolate and harsh. Her life is plenty grim. Not every story of poverty needs a cartoon like antagonist or a violent final act. 

As someone who's been homeless and is working class, I've never really been a fan of Loach's stuff. His works feel inauthentic and exaggerated. His stuff isn't without merit but he struggles with nuance. It all feels like it was made for some upper-middle class Lib-dem types.",lnwuxa
gpc28k6,">	 the structural causes the got them there in the first place

The backdrop of the film is that a single company decided it wasn’t profitable to stay open and an entire town vanished over night. Just because it doesn’t beat you over the head with it doesn’t mean the point that capitalists making capitalist decisions isn’t what left hundreds - if not thousands - of people stranded.

If the film idealizes the nomad lifestyle, it’s because Fern intentionally seeks out and surrounds herself with people who *want* the lifestyle, of which there are plenty. There are multiple examples in it of how one unexpected incident is a catastrophe; Fern being able to get bailed out by others doesn’t mean it doesn’t highlight how lucky she is that that’s the case.

It isn't an anti-Amazon or anti-corporate film. Its really about capturing a certain mileau - in this case, the lives of ageing nomads who rely on temporary gigs with companies like Amazon to make the limited amount of money they need to fund their lifestyle.

When Fern says that Amazon pays ''good money'', we're not meant to assume this is an endorsement of Amazon's pay practices or objectively consider it to be ''good money''. Rather, we're meant to realize that for Fern its ''good money'', because it enables her to live the life she's leading.",lnwuxa

I love comparing this movie to The Florida Project, because the Florida Project is a better version of this movie. 

That used actual characters who did things - they didnt just sit and recite a presentation on poverty, we saw them do things that people in poverty have to do to survive - but then we saw the human side of it all. Playing in parking lots becuase there's nothing else, making something from nothing, struggling to do what needs to be done to survive. 

There's no view behind any closed doors, because it couldn't decide if it wanted to be a documentary, or a fictional narrative. No characters had stakes, or tough decisions. Fern just floated around without a single tough choice to be made, with help to be found everywhere.

The camp's organizer's first scene is him talking about the ""tyranny of the dollar,"" how they're all tied to it, and how they're all workhorses ""sent out to pasture"" by society and have to work together as a result. Some others mention medical hardships for themselves or family members as driving forces for them to go into van life. Fern's own catalyst was the mining town shutting down and her husband dying, with her retirement benefits being unable to sustain her on its own. 

The film doesn't go to critique capitalism, instead presenting a lifestyle where everyone who partakes in it ends up loving it and do relatively well for themselves, but it's clear that if many of these people didn't fall into economic hardships, especially prudent given the film set shortly after the Great Recession, many wouldn't have needed to buy a van to live in.",lnwuxa

But it’s also a false fallacy as well, because we see that nomads, like all people, depend on each other all the time: when they are sick, van breaks down, need something, they have to be okay with depending on someone or having someone depend on them, even if it’s just for a brief while.

It felt more like someone’s wishful take on this lifestyle, than one that would actually result in some truly trying moments.

But, that's just me. Maybe this is an old person's movie as it's more introspective and slow-paced. As a 60+ year old, I so related to the spinning back around to another new year, even if things *seemed* the same to some viewers.

The movie's slow pace combined with another year arriving so soon is kind of like old age. Ha.

Fern was asked to be a nomad by a nomad. She was reluctant at first but gave it a shot. She enjoyed moving, communities and the stories told, hence wanting to continue being a nomad.

Keep in mind as well that she and her husband wanted to get away from bigger cities. That’s just their personalities. Fern could’ve went and moved in with her sister but she decided to work at Amazon after being thrown out instead. She likes the work, she likes the people and she likes the experiences! In my opinion, just because Fern had a way out of that life doesn’t mean she can’t live in it!

>There is a freedom to living in a van, not being tethered somewhere, having to pay rent, etc. and this movie did not shy away at all about the hardships of a van life. 

What hardships did it show without reiterating the point about how this is all beautiful. There might be a freedom the comes with living in a van but the comes after the struggle of being homeless. The film never makes that point as clear as it pointing out how beautiful it is to be living in a van.

You don't have to use the lives of homesless people to show the beauty of the Midwest lol. There are many filmmakers who have shown the beauty of something without romanticizing the lives of people who are forced to live in awful conditions.

rather this movie was about attachment. in particular, fern, played by frances mcdormand, was attached by the hip to her corporate job and her suburban life. when she lost that, she also in a way lost a part of herself. thats why she visits her former home in the end, so that she can finally close out her attachment to her economic status and be truly free like her friends on the road have been. she was moving in life but she hadnt really moved on from an emotional standpoint so when she does that, she finally moved on. in a way its a very anti-capitalist movie but thats just a reading of it, not the reading of it. the florida project never really explored complicated economic themes like this as it was more centered on childhood escapism",lnwuxa

The whole movie delved into her processing her grief in various ways before finally finding a solution. I don't find this depressing. And I don't think Fran would see it as such either. Nor would she see her change in her lifestyle as depressing.   


She simply accepted her new reality and along the way and picked up the tools to deal with that new reality the same way she picked up spare tires and can openers and glued together broken plates. 

She was busy making do and fixing stuff and making new friends and living her new life. I don't think she wallowed in whether that change was depressing or not. In fact, she specifically rejected the old comfort of a home and a family.  Instead, she chose to continue along her path as a nomad. So I don't think she would regard her life as depressing if she had a choice to stay put, but actively chose to be a nomad instead of accepting the ideas that her sister and David had in mind of a room in house.",lnwuxa
goerdeo,"One of the things people might do as a result of loss is to shed their ties that might hurt them if they lost again. This is part of the reason why Fran doesn't stay with her sister nor take David up on his offer to stay with him. It's not that she's building up walls exactly. It's that she's not leaving herself vulnerable should something happen that caused her to lose people she cared for.  


Fran had built up her resilience and independence. She had relied on other people before, but learned that she had to always carry her own spare and her own tools for getting herself out of trouble. This is true emotionally as well. She had to find her own tools of taking care of herself emotionally, too. And she was well on her way to doing that.  


I can understand how other people might consider that ""depressing"" if they haven't gone through some sort of loss and recovery like that themselves. But finding your own tools for self-care is a tough process if you've always relied on other people before. Learning a new thing out of necessity isn't necessarily ""depressing.""

>You’re supposed to just learn what it feels like to be a nomad and get a foot into that experience and the people in it! 

How am I gonna know what it feels like to be a nomad, if the movie itself feels very Disney-fied?

I think there is a push to rebrand ""homeless"" as ""houseless"" because houseless sounds so much less permanent than homeless. In the US, there are more than enough houses and apartments for every person. Lack of housing isn't the issue behind homelessness. 

Calling someone houseless sounds like a temporary situation and feels like there is a relatively easy fix.

She still has this van and we've used it to travel around the country for weeks at a time. The situations might be different than the ones these characters faced in this movie, but that doesn't mean that the feeling of being able to go wherever you want and see all the beauty this country has to offer isnt authentic, regardless of how you got there. Everybody knows how terrible it would be to be homeless, who are you to say that these people cant also live beautiful and fulfilling lives?

>Cool, so she used the lives of real nomads to make their lives look better than it actually was.

It sounds like this movie just wasnt made for you, and that's cool.

> But you have no idea what you're talking about when it comes to nomad life, which is also fine if what you're saying wasn't patronizing a whole group of people that may have been forced into a life because of shitty economic reasons, but found a great community and way of life that most of us just dont understand. And I thought it was really amazing to get a glimpse of what that life might look like. 

How is what I'm saying patronizing?  I'm not saying that nomads can't live beautiful and fulfilling lives. What I'm saying is that the idea that these conditions are poor and that it's due to systematic problems isn't properly explored in the movie and Zhao made what I thought was poverty porn for rich Hollywood folks to watch and think, these people are poor and homeless but it looks beautiful so them being in these situations is completely fine. Something like The Florida Project, although is not about nomads, completely understands that eventhough people living in poverty can lead beautiful lives, they still shouldn't be living in those conditions in the first place and that it's a hard struggle everyday to live in poverty even with beautiful moments of community and empathy. You can do both and many filmmakers have done so (also see great movies about disadvantaged minorities). The film focused almost purely on it the beautiful and it just doesn't sit right with me.",lnwuxa
go5eqtb,How am I stretching lol? The movie clearly wanted to be a movie about capturing the lives nomads and I don't think it accurately reflects their lives.

That's not how film works though. Film is not just a painting or sculpture though, it's also a piece of storytelling, especially dramatic stories like this. Even great abstract mood pieces out there have deep meaning instilled within them shown through subtext. It's not just a bunch of broad observations like with this film.

I'm not asking for the film to contain exposition or to explain its views. Just for it to have a clear text.",lnwuxa

gv2nmta,"Everyone brings their own context into the media they consume. It matters whether you're looking at Fern from the outside or whether you're looking out at the world from inside of Fern because you're closer to that reality than the outside world.

Probably by sheer numbers, there are more people on the outside looking at Fern than people from the inside of Fern looking outwards. That's also one of the reasons the nomads found solidarity and community out in the desert--- when they were spread far apart, they were each alone. But when they came together, they found commonality in a community.

The nomads must gather together from all over the place just to only amount to a small community. But it's still better than no community at all when they were all spread far and wide.

Sometimes, there just simply aren't the numbers to make your experience common. Fundamentally, that's why my take is rare--- most people's point-of-view comes from outside of Fern rather than from inside.  It's just a numbers thing. When you're different, you're ""othered"" by the majority who find comfort in being part of the masses.

but she also find beauty in the nomadic lifestyle, just like other aging nomads, and so does the movie -- not just in rocky vistas, but in a cheap hand-me-down chair, a lighter from a grimy young transient, a terminally ill old woman's pilgrimage to revisit her favorite memory before killing herself. for these older folks without many other options, it can be a difficult, lonely life -- but there is beauty and camaraderie in it, too. this movie shows both sides, as it should.",lnwuxa

Silence, for example, has a whole lot of nothing, that’s utterly essential to the plot. We have two men being slowly converted, and their inner tensions and struggles are turned into a rolling boil in the background while the plot chugs along.
