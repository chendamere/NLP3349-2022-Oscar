f9ubeex,"It feels like the whole movie is leading up to Charlie reading what Nicole has written for him. Such an emotional gut-punch. Maybe if they had opened up to each other in the beginning and communicated what they really felt in a clear and concise manner, the divorce could've been prevented. 

Also, another thing that I love about the movie, so much set-ups and payoffs. The knife, Henry's struggle to read (And the excellent emotional payoff of him reading the letter with his dad at the end), Nicole having to cut her family's hair and how shaggy Charlie looked during the separation. Wonderful writing. One of the best movies of 2019.",e6l8bc

f9wh4vn,"As a lawyer, this might be the most accurate legal movie I have ever seen. It nails how insane the process is to clients who have not navigated it before and how the lawyers are so divorced from the humanity of their clients and who they are opposing.

EDIT: Even little stuff, like the tactic (which they did on Big Little Lies too this season) of meeting with lawyers to conflict them out of representing the other side.

It's little but that scene of the lawyers chummily ordering lunch while Charlie and Nicole stare on with dead eyes was amazing.",e6l8bc

It was one of the most heartbreaking scenes I've seen in any movie, which got even more devastating when Charlie collapsed on his knees and Nicole held him.

f9v2lnv,"I caught this in theaters a couple weeks ago, and it‚Äôs my favorite film of the year. Funny, devastating, sweet...

One thing that really worked for me was Randy Newman‚Äôs score; it has a very similar feel to his Pixar music (though totally works for this film on its own). As a 26 year old, Newman‚Äôs *Toy Story*/*Bug‚Äôs Life*/*Monster‚Äôs Inc.* scores were the soundtrack of my childhood before getting into the works of people like John Williams or Hans Zimmer.

Hearing the playful, deeply heartfelt sounds of Newman‚Äôs music throughout this film lent it an extra emotional layer that helps it play as both very sweet and incredibly heartbreaking (like the best of Pixar). It‚Äôs a weird thing to have such a grown up film feel like an extension of my childhood.

On a similar note: the opening sequence of Charlie and Nicole listing what they love about one another was one of the most emotionally engaging film openings I‚Äôve experienced since *Up*.",e6l8bc

f9ykwy7,"Two songs from Company in 10 minutes. Really striking decision! Company, for those who don't know, is a really great Stephen Sondheim musical about a young New York bachelor who seems to have it all, but is secretly afraid of opening himself up to love. Most of the musical involves Bobby being a window onto the relationships of his married friends.

The two songs we hear in the musical are [you could drive a person crazy](https://youtu.be/qd5v0cTM8UA) (my personal favorite song in the musical) sung by a trio of Bobby's girlfriends, and [being alive](https://youtu.be/HnTu8IBWvTQ) the climactic final song where Bobby finally becomes aware of what he truly wants in life. Of course, the significance of being alive for Driver's character is obvious, but the decision to *also* include the girlfriend trio invites us to think about the relevance of the whole musical and its many views on marriage to the story.

What's kind of funny is that I think being alive works *better* in this movie than in many productions of Company that I've seen. It's actually a pretty hard song to do convincingly, as it basically has to carry Bobby's *entire* character arc, and it often feels unearned or unsatisfying unless it's just a stellar production. Here though, I feel like the song was the absolute perfect embodiment of Driver's character's emotional struggle throughout the film.",e6l8bc

Clearly neither one of them wishes evil upon the other, but the strenuous legal process and added stress of money problems and lawyer mud-slinging brings out the worst in them, until they are saying the worst imaginable things to each other.

Such an emotional scene that wouldn't have worked as well without the slow build to a much-needed pressure release. Masterful writing.",e6l8bc

faqs96y,"One observation, during the divorce ScarJo didn't care about supporting Driver's Halloween costume idea, even though it was clearly important to him.  The night was later ruined when he had to have a second late night trick or treating session and of course the kid was completely disinterested. 

Cut to a year later, the entire family is dressed as the Beatles, probably a shared passion with the new boyfriend but certainly something the NBF was excited about (he even says something about using the album cover for reference).  

But I doubt the son cared any more about the Beatles then he does Frankenstein.",e6l8bc
f9wiaty,The argument at Adam Driver's apartment was a masterclass in acting. Doesn't get much better than that.,e6l8bc
f9u1l6z,"The masterpiece of this movie is that you both feel awful for the characters and completely understand why they make every decision they make.

As much as it's an even-handed presentation of two sides of a divorce, this really feels like Adam Driver's movie. Especially in the back half, where - from the argument scene onwards - we really get to see a person with zero self-awareness begin to understand their flaws. 

Laura Dern's speech on the expectations of a mother is poignant and powerful, everything about the way her character was written and performed personified that same message. She's a very likely frontrunner for best supporting actress.

f9tmug3,"Too much of that beginning sequence where they were reciting their letters to each other were too on the nose with MY parents.

This movie is excellent, and Adam Driver needs an oscar nom.",e6l8bc
fa9ognt,"I found it lowkey heartbreaking when Charlie came over to LA the first time (just before being served) and the minute he came through the door, he kissed Nicole on the lips, thundered around making food and talking about himself, then went off to find a pooping Henry. Not once did he even ask Nicole, ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù or ‚Äúhow‚Äôs it going?‚Äù even though she was so courteous and genuinely interested in his wellbeing. 

In a relationship, no matter how much you love someone, if enough days go by where your partner doesn‚Äôt ask how you‚Äôre doing, that‚Äôs going to grind you down. The only time he really seemed to acknowledge her presence was when he was giving her an acting note at the beginning, and even then that was a critical observation as a director. At the end, when Nicole mentions she‚Äôs directing, she says something like ‚ÄúAnd now I see what you were so obsessed about.‚Äù  The look on Charlie‚Äôs face reveals so much shock, regret, and respect all at once.

fc1snrh,"The scene where Charlie reads Nicole‚Äôs notes about him with Henry made me wonder whether they would be in the position they were in had they read them during the therapy session at the beginning of the movie. 

I liked how this movie took a look into all that is not communicated even when people are married and together. The assumptions, the way decisions are made in passing, the way identities become enmeshed and people lose sight of who they are.

It was gripping, raw, and realistically sad and awkward all at the same time.",e6l8bc

fakv1bm,"Out of all the things in this sad movie, the thing that stuck with me the most is something that Alan Alda - ""the cheaper lawyer"" - said.

>You're going through all this because you love your kid, but by doing this, you're draining money from his education.

I honestly don't know how anybody can afford lawyers for anything long-term. I hired a lawyer to help me with a contract, once. The lawyer was cool and let me work with a junior lawyer in his firm who ""only"" charged me $100 an hour. I had to put in $500 for a retainer. I emailed 1 question to the junior lawyer, and she billed me like $25 for her response. It took her around 15 minutes to read my question, research it, and provide me with an answer, so boom, $25 taken from the retainer. Most expensive email I've ever received.

I wonder how accurate Marriage Story is when it comes to LA divorce lawyer fees. Ray Liota the big shot lawyer charged $950 an hour, and his assistant charged $400 an hour (""If you have a stupid question, email Ted!"").  In order to hire the big shot, Adam Driver had to pay for a $25,0000 retainer.

An email that takes Ted 15 minutes to answer would've cost $100. How many hours do lawyers work in an average divorce case? Hundreds of hours?

Sheeeee-it. Divorces are fucking expensive. Really makes living without kids and never getting married that much more appealing.",e6l8bc

f9tkw0r,"This film was just perfect. I loved it. I cried when Charlie sang, I cried when Nicole tied his shoelace, I cried when they had that big fight, I cried when Henry was reading the letter. It hit so close to home, as my parents got divorced when I was 12, and it wasn't peaceful. It was such a cathartic film, might be my favorite of the year, it's a toss-up between this and Portrait.",e6l8bc
f9ty8p7,"I loved this movie a lot and while the dramatic parts really work, the comedy is incredible. I don't think I laughed harder this year than with the bit with the knife.

That being said, I was listening to Filmspotting and they were able to articulate a point I felt while watching the movie. The decision to make Charlie actually cheat was a little disappointing, as it seemed like an easy way to balance the scales between the couple. I'd argue this is more Charlie's story and when the movie switches to his perspective, it's easy to take his side after Nicole blindsides him with the lawyer. So the reveal of him actually cheating seems like a bit of a shortcut to make us dislike him/give ourselves the distance to see him with less empathy. I would have preferred that piece of characterization cut to make the divorce even more gray, but the movie still does an amazing job in making us really care for Charlie despite that.",e6l8bc
f9tyzc0,"A film that will be talked about for years to come. Driver, Johansson and Baumbach fucking blew it away...

BUT I think we should take a moment and appreciate the cinematographer, Robbie Ryan, for his contribution. What a beautifully shot film.

f9tl5zm,"I was hyped, but damn. There are really a few movies that are capable of making me reavaluate my life, this was one of those. My parents have been divorced since i was young and this hit hard. When you are a kid you don't (and most likely isn't even capable to) stop to look at both sides, are you choosing one over another because they are giving you more presents? Or because you enjoy more spending time with them? Do you know what your parents are giving up to be with you? Do you know what they are giving up to be together and make you happier? Endless questions that most likely don't have answers, since each one has their perspective and, as a kid, you basically don't. Not an easy watch when a movie hits this close home, will be thinking about it for a while",e6l8bc
fb7ll6o,"This movie is SO realistic for what separation and divorce feels like between two people (and co-parents) who really do love each other, but have come to the point where their relationship no longer sustains their needs and dreams as individuals. 

It really struck a chord with me as someone who separated from their spouse and moved very far away. I separated from my spouse in 2016, and had to move back home to the States with our then nearly 2 yo daughter from France. This movie mirrors so many of the moments I lived. The painful task of doing what you have to do to save your sanity... to go back home to fight for yourself and your light again, while also knowingly hurting the person that you have given your all to for years prior... Feeling so incredibly victimized and also so incredibly selfish. All the nasty fights where you say viscous things you regret instantly and wonder ""who is this person?"" about both yourself and your spouse... holding each other when you cry about it all, even though your feelings haven't changed. The ways in which you have to take a stance against them in order to protect yourself.... and the ways in which you try to be loving and helpful during the awful process, because it's just what you are used to doing -- supporting your spouse...  I'll never forget my spouse helping us pack and driving us to the airport and us saying our goodbyes... turning around to see if he was still there when I was in the security line and seeing that he had walked away.... and moving ahead in tears on to the next chapter of my life. It will forever be one of the most painful and yet pivotal moments of my life.

I loved the way the film ended -- it is so real for me. My spouse also ended up relocating here after resisting the move for about a year. I still have a lot of unresolved guilt about him having to leave his country, and all the times I know he's been miserable because of it. But that is how life is and I think it is what the film illustrates so masterfully. Beneath all of the complicated decisions, and the tangled web of consequences they weave, there is still so much love and so much worth protecting left over from a union that really just transitioned to something else other than a marriage. My ex will always be my partner as a parent, and I will love and support him until I die, and celebrate his accomplishments. I know he feels the same for me. I think this is what still remains between Nicole and Charlie at the end of the film. 

The only thing I didn't like about this film is that we have recently felt ready to get divorced officially, and now I am terrified of how our now amicable separation will be affected by the process... We also always say ""no lawyers when we get divorced, 50/50 custody, no fights..."" and I felt pretty confident that would be true until now!

Both performances were just so so well done. I saw so much of myself in both characters. Scarlett Johansson's monologue is one of the best things I've ever seen and when her face is literally RED with RAGE during their big fight, I was blown away by how she delivered that scene. Adam Driver's entire performance was transcendent. His moments of vulnerability made me weep a few times throughout the film. And the song! That scene is now in my top 5 favorite moments in a film of all time.",e6l8bc

f9wo9f8,"I feel like this movie blue balled me so hard. I was waiting for the scene where they realize they can reconcile their differences, and that their love is still there, just being distorted by the strenuous divorce process. The scene where they embrace, telling each other they want to get back together and they kiss and make up and it all goes back to when they were in love. 

But the dichotomy is too great, and we never get that fairy tale ending. As a kid whose parents got divorced when I was 5, I always fantasizes about my parents getting back together, but I eventually learned it just wasn‚Äôt going to happen. In many ways I could sympathize with Henry, and I saw a lot of my dad in Charlie, struggling to keep a brave face when everything seemed to be going against him.

Man this movie hit close to home. I did like the last scene where Nicole ties his shoes, showing that even though their differences were insurmountable, the love and care they have for each other will always be there. I really wanted that fairy tale happy ending, but the one we got was more fitting.

Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson were downright phenomenal and, as of right now, I couldn‚Äôt possibly think of better or more believable performances coming out of any film this year. The music is wonderful and the 35mm photography looks fantastic but those two performers and the exceptional script make the film. Noah Baumbach has proven himself to specialize in realistic conversations but how delicately he treats these two characters makes this soar way above the rest of his work. Expectations were high but I was shocked to find myself utterly engrossed for every moment of this story we‚Äôre probably all very familiar with.

fn22qb3,"Currently rewatching the movie and man, if Charlie had just listened to Bert he would have saved a lot of time, money, and suffering. He definitely lost the most in the divorce.   

My take from this movie and my experience with those who I know who have gotten divorced is that you really should experience life fully and learn what you truly want out of life before you marry. Often times marriages end because people don't have a strong sense of identity. 

Charlie had a strong sense of identity and Nicole did not. Nicole was able to end up better at the end because she got many of the things she realized she wanted. While Charlie lost all the things he already had. Neither are bad people,perhaps they were just not compatible or met at the wrong time.


It's a great movie overall, very great acting. Sadly it's the reality for many.",e6l8bc
ff2y8np,"Wife and I watched this last night.


She's a therapist who has been through a divorce previously.

My parents divorced with I was 14.

We both came out with incredibly different perspectives on this movie. She sat through the lawyer scenes and was like ""Holy shit, this is totally true."" while I sat through the scenes with Charlie and his child and also said, ""Holy shit, This is totally true.""


The fake ""buying shit to build the facade of a nice home"" is totally something that happens. Also, My heart died a little when the kid said ""I don't want to go out again for halloween,"" but Charlie made him do it anyway because it was what he wanted, instead of the fact that Henry was already tired and probably wasn't up for going out a second time.

And of course, at the end of it, you're left with a feeling of ""Well, our original goals are accomplished, just we went through all of this shit to get there."" and it's amazingly empty feeling. They really captured that well.

Really interesting movie.",e6l8bc
ffbeeov,"as most ppl said i found myself rooting for charlie more than nicole. however, we didn't see much of the marriage itself. I absolutely sided with nicole about all the selfishness of her husband not wanting to move to LA. it seems like he was indeed quite self centered though both had their flaws.

although she kinda screwed him in this whole legal process, it was more pressuring from that black lady towards the beginning of the movie and nora after that. she was clearly not happy with the 55/45 thing

i thought it was really rough seeing charlie being kinda not great with the kid, cuz we know he loves him but he's in this situation where he's just getting the short end of the stick. henry is always tired and stuff after spending time with nicole and i guess spending more time with her naturally made him favor her. it's gotta be painful seeing that your son doesn't really wanna be with you as much anymore but you kinda gotta force both him and yourself into being together to desperately grasp at and try to mend what you got. at the same time, you gotta deal with all this stuff that's being thrown at you with the legal process and such",e6l8bc
faj4yof,"What honestly blew me away the most about this movie is the monologue Nora gave when Nicole was rehearsing what to say in front of the observer.

Comparing God to an absentee father and Mary as this bastion of why society has this view that mothers are all wonderful. While you can also see where Nicole has a kind of off relationship with her mother and doesn't want to be compared to her later. But it was so well written and so cold hearted that you could tell she was only after the money and saw the whole thing as a way to make more money from a poor father.

Also this movie did well as portraying both of them as not perfect but also having realistic flaws that of course you could see a couple getting in real fights. The emotions were so raw and real. One of the best movies of the year by far 9.5/10",e6l8bc

fck1vf9,"God, this movie was so refreshing. No technical marvels, no cool narrative structure, no gimmicks. Just a great script and great actors. Stripped down, tight, perfect. I‚Äôve been really frustrated lately with films that get everything right but neglect the writing. But film and TV are exercises in storytelling, and the writing IS the story. A movie with good writing and adequate everything else is always better than a movie or show with excellent everything else but lazy writing (just look at Game of Thrones). Because what‚Äôs the point of all that stuff if it‚Äôs in service of a garbage story? There isn‚Äôt one, any more than there‚Äôs a point to decorating the walls of a house that has no walls, or owning a bunch of Christmas ornaments but forgetting to buy a tree.

No, sista. Even though Charlie should've been worrying about his wife's wishes too, in this world if you don't stand up for yourself, you'll be *crushed*.

Apart from that and some scenes that drag, actually fantastic movie. It gets increasingly nightmarish and overwhelming. I loved the clever reincorporations, I loved the technique.

famnepo,"I know this is an old thread and no one‚Äôs gonna read this but this movie hit me so hard on multiple levels and I don‚Äôt know where else to vocalize how I feel after watching the movie. 


For one, as the child of parents who were divorced when I was at an early age, seeing the kid being treated as a pawn in a game to see the kid more is the most heartbreaking thing imaginable. Waking up and realizing one day that a parent was being extra nice to you just to win, not because they actually care about you. There were so many moments in the film where I audibly groaned at how both parents were treating the kid. 


Then there‚Äôs the level of Adam Driver‚Äôs character. I‚Äôve always been closer to my dad. And seeing his world crumble as he lost everything that mattered to him just to stay with his som crushed me. That‚Äôs what my dad did. He went to deep into debt just to get a 50/50 agreement. Lawyers, especially divorce lawyers, are the worst. 


Then the whole dynamic of the marriage. I‚Äôm just barely starting my 20s and don‚Äôt know anything about marriage, but as someone struggling to get over a past relationship this was a hard watch for me. It‚Äôs been over six months and it still feels like a part of me is attached to and loves my ex. Seeing the ending where they are apart despite still having feelings for each other crushed me. But it also crushed me on another level. My parents never got along. My mom despised my father. And seeing the two parents get along made me unbelievably depressed over a reality I never got to experience",e6l8bc

f9tjtxz,"Thoughts, random but non the less: 

Shout out to Robert Smigel as the mediator! 

Caught Marriage Story at IFC theater because I got tired of the hype I kept hearing/reading, especially when Bong Jong Ho claimed it one of his favorite films of this year in his AMA. Absolutely worth it. Nothing beats sobbing with complete strangers in the same room. 

- Pablo: ‚ÄúYou know, the Japanese are making a really interesting tequila right now‚Äù
- Nicole: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exciting, I guess‚Äù

As a child coming from a divorced family, and as someone who also has gone through my own divorce, this film absolutely broke me. When Charlie wishes out loud to Nicole that she were dead. It brought back all the times my ex wife and I argued, and wanting to hurt her with the most vile words ever. I broke the fuck down to that scene. In ways, this movie can be therapeutic, in others, its a reminder theres always fixing to do in a relationship. Sometimes I wish I did more fixing.

fh97jkj,"This movie surprised me with how much I could relate to it. Not regarding my own current relationship, but regardig how I perceived my parents' divorce when I was a child myself, especially as they lived thousands of kilometres apart, as well.

These exact arguments, these exact emotions, the confused children, the increasing constructed ugliness of the legal processes - it's all very real, and I liked that this for once was something more universal than most US-centric law stuff in movies. 

What was less surprising was the stellar acting. Of course, Laura Dern and Adam Driver were known to me as great actors, but I liked Scarlett Johansson in a slightly different role than usual maybe the most in this movie. Fantastic experience all around, and very thought-provoking and kind of brave as a cinematic piece.",e6l8bc

I too felt Charlie's pain when he found out Nicole got lawyers. They agreed for none, but she went ahead and got one. Then, I was even more surprised when he had to pay a percentage of her lawyer. Wow.  

Henry annoyed me at times, but eh, he is a kid and he doesn't understand the full reality of the situation, or how much he is hurting his father. The trick-or-treating with Charlie and Henry was sad.   

Overall, great acting, and nice storyline. But nothing too memorable for me.",e6l8bc
fnn2ffj,"For those who believe Nicole is inferior or 'evil', we must understand that the film primarily discusses the perspective of Charlie. Whilst, we are able to indulge in Charlie's challenges, struggles, and emotions, Nicoles perspective remains limited.

 The producers want us to acknowledge Charlie's frustration and response to the situation, but as a viewer, although it's okay to empathize and understand Charlie, it is important to maintain an open mind and know that Nicole is probably equally disputed. She never wanted to disappoint Charlie, but she also has to listen to herself and acknowledge her own desires. It is important to validate the feelings of both characters before jumping to conclusions or declaring a clear 'victim'. Nobody 'won' the divorce. The film is not about winning or losing.

ffd60gk,"I was kinda apprehensive about watching this, because when it first came out, I saw the clip of the big fight scene on Twitter, and thought it looked absolutely terrible. Completely forced and unbelievable, just shouting things that people wouldn't actually say. 

But, I always want to see all the Best Picture nominees, and I'd heard plenty of people say they liked it, so I finally sat down to give it a shot. And I really wanted to give it a fair shake, I was doing my very best not to be prejudiced.

However, those initial scenes were REALLY making it hard. I just did not believe in these people, either of them. Both characters, and their narration about the other, felt totally artificial. I was feeling this growing panic -- am I going to spend the next two hours watching something awful and unengaging?

But then they revealed the context: that these were letters the characters had each written about the partner they were separating from, and Scarlett Johansson saying she didn't like hers, and Adam Driver's obvious arrogance about the one he'd written, and I felt relieved. I'm still not 100% sure I wasn't supposed to like the opening scenes, but I could swallow them a *lot* easier in the light that these were the characters writing about each other from a particular perspective, instead of Noah Baumbach just describing his own brilliant creations.

ANYWAY: I turned out to really like the movie. It was entertaining and engaging and, in fact, believable. I was feeling a little bored around the time Adam Driver took the kid trick-or-treating, but it picked up again. The whole sequence with the dinnertime visit at the apartment is a jaw-dropping masterpiece of cringe and I am wholeheartedly impressed.

I love Merritt Wever. I love Julie Hagerty. I love Alan Alda. And: RICK MOTHERFUCKING FULCHER??!?!! IN A ONE-MINUTE-LONG, COMPLETELY MEANINGLESS CAMEO?!?!? WHERE THE FUCK DID THAT CAME FROM??? *That* sure as fuck woke me up.

Even the fight scene, it turns out, works, when you have the build-up of the characters and what they've been through (and put each other through). They've spent so much time holding back their anger that I could understand how it could finally come out in words that would not make sense in a run-of-the-mill argument. But, you know, after I watched the whole movie, I did look up that clip and watch it again on its own, and I still found it terrible. It doesn't work in isolation even when you know the background.

fqozap5,"**Here's what I got**

* Moral of the story - Nicole and Charlie were both selfish and unable to reach a compromise. Coupled with horrible communication. I mean, how do you not settle on the place you want to raise your kid and a basic game plan. And was Charlie right, staying in NY since he won the grant?

* I wish the movie went deeper into how they both fell out of love. I guess Nicole wasn't feeling like she was being respected, but it takes two to tango. Why did Charlie fall out of love? Anything other than withholding the sex and being pushed to the couch? So he went straight for the easy bang? Too simple.

* I think a better title would be 'A Hollywood Marriage Story'. The strain between a creative genius and an aspiring actress aren't something that most people deal with. It made the movie less relatable to me. Also felt like a bitter divorced writer's memoir by making Nicole the 'bitch that took everything'.

* Awesome acting from everyone involved. Really entertaining and pulls on the heart strings when thinking about a parent's love for their child. Hard not to have an opinion on this one.",e6l8bc

fppmyz7,"Just watched the movie. Really liked the realistic approach and that goddamn amazing acting. As I see many people taking sides of either Nicole or Charlie (mostly Charlie). I think the Noah makes it look grey and I love that. They both had their faults, they both weren't exactly willing to go the aggresive way their respective lawyers went. At the end of the day, they were a couple that simply lacked communication. Like Nicole was always confused about what she really wanted and Charlie was selfish enough to simply assume what others really wanted when it's actually all about him. That's the reason I couldn't completely sympathize with Charlie. He was so not cooperating when it came to what's best for their kid. Neither did I necessarily feel like rooting for Nicole.

It's not really about who's the worse one. They both are flawed who took decisions that they might not be proud of due to the circumstances. This movie showed sorta the reality of a divorce and how it affects both sides in a subtle way and not so subtle way at times.",e6l8bc
fa9lo22,"I think Charlie was meant to be likeable as a person (his cast seems to love him, he leads very well) but not a very good partner. He doesn't even dispute it when Nicole said she loved him more than he loved her.

Nicole has much higher emotional intelligence for other people, but also had trouble finding her own identity, which is how she was drawn into that type of marriage in the first place. The first scene in Nora's office is when she starts to see herself as her own person and not an accessory to him. She is defending him and talking him up in the beginning of the scene, and as she walks through what happened she starts to see that he didn't see them as equals in the relationship - he was used to being the director in every part of life (which is probably how he made it from nothing.)

Even if he is the more talented between the two (which may not be true given her accomplishment at the end), partners can't work like that. It reminded me of the scene at the end of Friday Night Lights where Coach Taylor asks Tammy if he can come along with her. It was such a novel and important scene, and Charlie would've never even considered that decision.

I think him laughing at her part (as she described it) is what hurt her the most and caused her to deliver the first cold shoulder.

Also, Alda's line about the intent of the process was really important and I haven't seen it brought up. People get screwed by the way things are set up. But the first intent of the flawed system is to prevent screwing to the people who can least afford it. Neither Charlie or Nicole fall in that category.",e6l8bc

I watched the movie with my girlfriend. The trailer had piqued her interest. Her parents divorced over a decade ago. Both of us were balling all throughout Charlie and Nicole's explosive argument. She said that's what happened with her parents during their tough times but on a daily basis. This movie is good at showing the ugly side of divorce and what happens when the legal system gets involved.

The movie was clearly written by someone who has had an extremely personal experience with divorce. I've liked a lot of Baumbach's films. He just continues to get better.",e6l8bc

fi1kech,"A lot of people said this movie was unrealistic, or the characters weren't likeable enough, and i honestly disagree, i found the movie to be immensely relatable, specially as a child of divorced parents. The way the characters talked and interacted, how things unraveled, it pretty much mirrored how it went for me. Specially when it comes to Henry's behavior, since it was the exact same thing for me with my own father, even with the apathy and not wanting to do things with him, or my father not doing anything with me while i visited him because he was too busy. Hell! even henry living in his grandma's house was the same thing for me, or the whole cheating thing from my father! I could go on and on about it, but i just want to say that i'm truly glad i watched this view, because i was able to understand each and every view point and it made everything so much better. I saw some comments stating that Nicole was awful, and that's not true. a lot of things in this movie depend on how you view life and your experiences, and for someone like me, who was by the side of my mother through the whole process, not really understanding anything but still seeing how it affected her, knowing her deeply and trying to help her every way i could, i really did feel bad for Nicole. Divorces are not pretty, specially if you give up on everything you have for someone (which my mother did), and it can leave you completely lost afterwards, except for a need to survive and argue with your ex-spouse as no matter what, something will go bad for either one of you, there isn't really a true middle ground, it's just nasty from start to finish. And in another hand, it made me understand my father a little more. He was never a good guy, he's a very big douche, both to me, my mom, his family and even his current wife, but still, it helps to sort of get how he felt in this process as he lost most physical contact with me, since we both slowly started moving farther and farther away from eachother, and it wasn't really intentional, it just happened.

fadcc8r,"Charlie and Nicole's relationship is heartbreaking. They're very compatible people with extremely similar artistic tastes finding success and themselves at different points in their lives. I really believe the disconnect between their growth as individuals fostered a poor environment for a relationship. The film does a really great job making the audience empathize with both characters but it does an even better job stressing how detrimental a lack of unfiltered communication can be to a relationship. I found it to also be a pretty comical expos√© about legal hell that is divorce in the US.   
   
I believe there were a lot of points in the story where it became apparent to both Nicole and Charlie that they always respected each other's desires and accomplishments in life, more importantly praise things about each other that they don't singularly appreciate about themselves. It was truly devastating watching each of them slowly realize that they were always willing and capable of doing the things they needed to do to both be happy and preserve their marriage but never did.  
   
One thing I really liked was the regression of Charlie as a character during the divorce process. The unkempt hair was a nice touch but one scene that really stuck out to me was the evaluator's visitation. Charlie leaving the lights on in the kitchen and his lack of attention to detail (forgetting to cover up a hole he punched in the wall, forgetting to retract the blade, not remembering where he put his cups or how the cabinets open) were really great details incorporated really naturally into that scene.  
  
One thing I didn't like at first was the very casual incorporation of Charlie's infidelity. Even with prior knowledge of Noah Baumbauch's previous marriage, that whole thing just seemed like a lazy dynamic that was unnecessarily integrated into the film to balance the consistency of wrong-doings between both parties. I felt like Charlie's narcissism and negligence was enough for us to be able to empathize with Nicole, but at the same time I can understand how many audiences otherwise would've fucking hated Nicole had it not been included. It's also worth noting that this film is very much a spiritual biopic of Baumbauch's own marriage, so it not being included would've definitely come across as disingenuous at the very least, immoral at it's worst, and probably something he personally wouldn't have been comfortable doing. Perhaps it was the way it was presented in the film that rubbed me the wrong way, but the more I think about it the more I realize that it got addressed about as much as every other problem in their relationship.  
  
Overall, this movie was phenomenal. The screenplay is a masterpiece. Truly career best performances from both leads. Hope this movie gets the recognition it deserves.",e6l8bc

fbayn1n,"Just haven't been able to stop thinking about this, it's an incredible movie for me. I felt emotional all through it, but from when Charlie sings ""Being Alive"" I was just waiting to cry, and finally did when he hit the ""I fell in love with him two seconds after I saw him"" line in the letter. Found myself inexplicably bursting over it again the next day, I'm not sure if that's ever happened to me before. I keep realising things about it the more I let it sit with me, and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't informing things about my life at the same time. It's a delicate thing to pull off too because these people are so difficult to relate to for many of us in terms of their profession, finances, culture, location etc. but their humanity is always centre stage even in its most theatrical moments. It doesn't feel like there's a barrier to the heart, perhaps because our leads are always pushing to solve this in a human way but are pulled in different directions by forces that, while not completely out of their control, they've certainly lost control of. It's wholesomely heartbreaking and I love it to pieces.",e6l8bc

Showy scenes like the apartment fight and Nicole‚Äôs monologue about the history of her marriage are of course incredible, but scenes like Nicole practicing for her interview and Charlie‚Äôs first meeting with Ray Liotta are amazing examples of great acting as well. Same goes for Laura Dern‚Äôs first scene where all she does is introduce herself and listen to Nicole. Also Merrit Weaver getting nervous at her role in handing Charlie the envelope.

My parents divorced when I was really young so seeing those scenes where Charlie was getting frustrated at his son for just wanting to spend time with him really resonated with me. My dad got super angry at me once when I was at his house for the weekend and I told him I wanted to go home even though it was a Friday. I can understand why my dad was frustrated but this movie showed me a new, deeper perspective I guess. Also that scene with the babysitter was uncomfortable.

But....if this is what marriage really is like it makes me want nothing to do with it.

in my mind it wasnt just a simple fight like what happens but they both became vindictive and pretty horrible to each other towards the end i mean yeah crap happens but is this really how modern marriages are? just fussing and complaining hafl of the time to the point that you end up nearly hating each others guts?

given the divorce rate of late i guess so lol

but it felt like the ENTIRE movie was just them fussing at each other. a good movie balances the ups and downs and it would have been better to seen more of that.  I just did not like it. maybe married people will understand and appreciate it more 

but from my standpoint they both seemed like they had SERIOUS issues and it would have been far better to just have ended it.   But i guess thats just me.",e6l8bc
f9wm2m3,"Thought it was great. Really tough at times (the big argument scene was very raw), but great. Perfect performances across the board. Driver and Johansson were excellent, and this movie only confirms my belief that Alan Alda is one of the most naturalistic actors ever.

I don't know how funny it was *supposed* to be, but the scene where he accidentally ""accidentally"" cuts himself is maybe the hardest I've laughed at a movie all year, even with full awareness that it's completely falling apart for him.

I thought it was well-balanced in that I was constantly switching ""sides"" of who I thought was right, or better. Even though it's from the husband's point of view and clearly draws a lot from Baumbach's own life, I thought he was really fair to the wife character. I surprisingly didn't totally hate the husband for cheating, and that's a small miracle in itself.

The scene where the son is talking to the evaluator about being ""at dad's"" and being ""home"" was a really devastating moment. My heart totally sank. 

The framing of a lot of the scenes was great. Cutting between them as they close the gate was super-duper obvious symbolism but it was still pretty powerful. And during the big argument scene, when he goes into the son's room and she follows him and we can just see through a sliver of the doorway, I thought it was very effective. The whole argument scene was really well-shot. The camera getting closer and closer made it feel so intimate that it quickly became uncomfortable. 

Baumbach's been kind of hit-or-miss for me for most of his career, but I thought that this was just excellent. I can see it picking up tonnes of acting awards for the leads, but I hope the supporting cast isn't taken for granted because every performance was great.

Edit: Oh, and Johansson's monologue in the lawyer's office was outstanding. The ease with which she shifted from frustrated, to nostalgic, to lamenting, and everywhere in between was a treat to watch.",e6l8bc
facy8lz,"I think this was the first movie I‚Äôve watched with my girlfriend where I just let it all out. I cried in front of her multiple times and just didn‚Äôt care. So much emotions. The scene when he was telling Nicole he wishes she was dead just hit me so hard. You know there was no truth in it, but this ugly divorce process brought out the worst of two people who genuinely love eachother. He said the most hurtful thing he could say to her and immediately regretted it. I almost broke down as bad as he did during that scene. Great movie.",e6l8bc
fanqdj8,"Marriage Story is definitely one of the best movies of 2019. The raw emotion in its scenes drove me to tears. Noah Baumbach did an incredible job in portraying divorce in a moving yet realistic manner. The rationalization for both sides felt real and reasonable, Nicole and Charlie were just flawed people with mostly good intentions. And yet, divorce can break even them, and show their ugly sides.

The ending of the movie left a bittersweet tang in my mouth. It says something unspoken so loudly: Was the divorce even necessary? They could have worked through their feelings, fought for their love. But they both know it's too late to do anything. It broke my heart.

An incredible tearjerker of a film. It will forever hold a place in my heart.",e6l8bc
fb7lpul,"woah I'm about 20 minutes after finishing watching this and came to the realisation that the envelope scene was probably a setup to Nicole being nominated for Best Directing in the final moments of the film. Despite her telling her family off as they treat the arrival of her almost ex-husband like a scene, it most definitely reeked of one as Nicole directed their entrances, exits and movements. It's great how it all went to shit in the moment and I think that makes for a nice payoff when she lets Charlie know about her nomination

Fantastic movie",e6l8bc

fd9h073,"Watched Marriage Story twice. The first time, I decided not to feel any emotion, I just wanted to see the acting for curiosity's sake. The 2nd time I watched it, I got somehow affected by the story more . I even discussed it with a friend.

Some things I noticed (written randomly):


1. The Invisible Man and ghost costumes for both Halloweens also reflect what Charlie had become to Nicole. Invisible and a ghost. Sure they still cared for each other in some ways but Nicole had basically given up on him as her husband. They still cared, but she was out.


2. IMO, Adam's acting was better than ScarJo's. I was expecting even more tears and fist shaking from her in the big fight scene in the apartment. Those were some hurtful words Charlie told her so I was expecting more anger and offense from her.

3. Charlie's knife trick is also a symbol of the pain he is experiencing, I think. His hurt like a wound that he dismisses as nothing but actually it is making him bleed. But the location of the cut didn't hit a big artery so I didn't expect it to be his end. It will heal. I guess it was probably superficial or he would have needed sutures/stitches. I think that the wound is also superficial because their love for each other was also superficial and they would both heal by the end of the movie, which is what happened. If their love was deep and strong, they wouldn't have divorced.

4. When Charlie was decorating his apartment, was he talking to the stage manager he had an affair with(Mary Anne)? I noticed that she said ""l love you"" during the video call and he said ""love you too"" back. I guessed he was moving on in his love life?

5. The tears at reading the ""things I love about Charlie"" were, for me, tears of regret at the love that was lost but could not be regained. 

6. I don't mean to put down people's appearances, but I think the detail of having the new boyfriend of Nicole look like that, thin, not muscular, no dark wavy hair, not dressed impeccably, the opposite of Charlie's appearance, were details that Baumbach put in to show how Nicole has chosen a guy who is not like Charlie.

7. The first time I watched it, I was hoping they would get back together in the future. But after watching it again and thinking about the small details of the film, that would be highly improbable. Nicole wanted a different life, Charlie was resigned to it. The film showed how they didn't communicate, and their love for each other was not deep enough to last til death do they part. Both were really obstinate and selfish.

 No one wins here. It is like a ""documentary"" about how a marriage dissolved. It shows how both moved on and life went on for both of them afterwards.",e6l8bc
fdmltg2,"Fantastic movie and acting all around. I love reading these comments and seeing people take sides, and honestly, everyone is right. That's the best part. The realism in this movie makes these two characters not black and white, but grey like they should be. They both have good and bad qualities, and the ""side"" you pick depends on who you are as a person and which wrongdoings trigger you more. I personally kept going back and forth with who's side I was on until the credits rolled, and I realized that I'm supposed to accept that they've both done wrong, grown as people, and moved on for hopefully better lives.

fbo559r,"This movie was incredible. I didn‚Äôt even know it existed ‚Äî I was literally just browsing Netflix for something to watch and saw Driver on the thumbnail and clicked play. I expected a rom com. So this took me by complete surprise and blew me away. My throat is sore from crying.

A testament to how well this was written ‚Äî I found myself rooting for Nicole at first, then Charlie, then Nicole again, then Charlie, hating both lawyers (though Nora seemed particularly spiteful), then feeling bad for both of them. Neither Charlie nor Nicole were the antagonists or the victims here and it was impossible to take a side, even if I do feel Charlie‚Äôs ending was more depressing ‚Äî though not at Nicole‚Äôs fault. 

It reminded me of my childhood, and the divorce my parents went through. That argument in the apartment almost gave me PTSD with how scary accurate it was. I remember laying in bed at night hearing my parents scream bloody murder at each other almost every night before their divorce. 

This might be my favorite movie of the year.",e6l8bc
fcimudg,Anyone else get extremely queezy when Charlie cut himself and half fainted? I'm not a squeamish person and I'm surprised that got to me like it did.,e6l8bc
fdcepga,"Firstly, this movie is incredibly well shot and acted. I love how intentionally dramatic some shots are, like the gate scene, and then you also have long takes that really focus on the actor, like the scene where Nicole is first talking to her lawyer and breaking down why she wants a divorce. I don‚Äôt know much about film terms but shots like that look great. Also, is it just me or does the movie look....old? Like the movie looks like it was shot on maybe early to late 2000‚Äôs cameras not 2019 ones. If that‚Äôs intentional that was a great choice because it makes the movie look more real. 

My main gripes are what the movie is saying, or trying to say, by how it treats Charlie. Instead of a story of a couple falling out of love amicably because real people do that, and all the hardships that come with it, we get a story of Charlie being villainized over and over. We are told that Charlie is controlling, he puts his career first, he had an affair, all of which are valid reasons to fall out of love with someone, but the movie presents Nicole with significantly less flaws, or rather Charlie just doesn‚Äôt bring them up as often(which I blame the Director for).

It‚Äôs not until Charlie gets his own assshole lawyer that he can finally fight back, and even then he still doesn‚Äôt get what he wants. He does manage to protect his grant money and I do like how the movie shows that Nicole isn‚Äôt the type to take **everything** from Charlie, because with the lawyer she had she might‚Äôve been able to.

If anything I‚Äôve taken from this movie it‚Äôs that divorces are way too expensive and suck all around, which if that was the point then Noah Baumbach hit the nail on the coffin. I don‚Äôt hate it, I just thought maybe more could be said about marriages, divorces, and maybe even the process of rebuilding yourself and finding a new identity after a breakup. Overall I‚Äôm feeling a solid 8-9/10 in execution, but message wise I can‚Äôt confidently say this movie is saying anything particularly profound.",e6l8bc
f9ueasv,"Jesus this movie hits close to fucking home. Right down to having the same goddamn dishwasher make and model in the ""you've been served"" scene. As a man, I relate more to Scar Jo's character, interestingly enough. Truly remarkable film.",e6l8bc
f9ytsb8,"The courtroom hearing where Nicole and Charlie sit in near silence while their attorneys verbally give twisted versions of everything they should've said to each other. That's such an incredible scene. The subtext, but Scarlett and Adam's nuanced glass-eyed staring.

I think what is so well done is despite the fact they're going through a rough divorce, they both know how much more complicated they made it, and there's so much remorse. For every event that pushes the separation in the wrong direction, they are surprisingly pretty civil to one another out of love for their son. They do a wonderful job conveying that despite how calm they are in many scenes they share, there's a lot of emotional pain boiling underneath. When Nicole comforts Charlie in the apartment after he breaks down, that was much more powerful than if they had done something like her leaving the apartment angrily while he sat in his apartment alone, crying. Choices like that are what elevate the story for me.",e6l8bc
fehkqrh,"Even if you think Charlie was at fault, he was a good father.  I don't think that is in question.  What bothers me most about this film is how easily Nicole was willing to rip Charlie from his child's life.  She knew Charlie loved being a dad yet she was totally willing to move 3000 miles away where he couldn't really be a true ""parent"" anymore.  Regardless of Charlie's infidelity and everything else, that just seems so incredibly cruel.",e6l8bc
f9tmh1i,"This movie deserves all the awards. Adam Driver and ScarJo gave two of the best performances of the decade, not just this year. It's a shoe-in for best original screenplay.

I don't think Baumbach will win Best Director but incredible job, he's been one of the defining filmmakers of the decade for me.",e6l8bc
fgridep,"I like Scarlett Johansson's acting better than Adam Driver's in this. Not that he was bad or anything, her performance just resonated with me more.

However, the characters are hard to relate to. Mostly because movies about the entertainment industry and the types of people in it are hard to relate to. Their problems seem almost completely artificial. The characters seem like intelligent people who could work things out, but don't because the plot depends on them getting a divorce.",e6l8bc
fmduwfj,"First of all, I am a gay male so theres that. I think poeple being overly sorry for the husband and saying the wife was bad shows to me one of the issues pointed out in this very film with our society, the rooted, sublte mysogeny and blaming women for wanting and desiring, and there upholding of being perfect and caring, god forbid them to push there own agenda when it inteferes with the mans agenda.

 I think that at least one of the major ideas was how in relationships there can be this very sublte form of abuse (i dont think it is a gender thing but may very well be more so from men). I think scarletjo masterfully exposes this point when she is talking with Nora for the first time. He had absorbed her in such a way he didnt see her as something other than himself. She lost all voice or identity in the relationship. But he wasnt a traditional ""villain"" in any way. And that is what makes it complicated, and why she slowly got pulled in a vortex and lost herself in his world. Women are socialized in a way to be ""givers"", ""helpfull""  and ""supportive""  and the wife takes on that very role throughout the movie. She always would just conciede and follow directions while he would always ""direct"" and call the big shots. I think that was the point of the whole director vs actress analogy.  But of course It wouldve been much easier if he was just traditionally ""bad"",  yet that wasnt the case. Its so much harder to justify leaving a relationship (for society and onself) when the reasons are so subjective, deep layered, and just not apparent, even when this behavior can be pyscologically abusive to the parnter. You can even see how her own mother would not understand why she wanted a divorce and would vouch for him. He is not villanized by the film and quite the contrary is praised as a wonderfull dad and a person, but in the context of the relationship,  he is a terrible selfish partner. He never really ever even understands her feelings or the reason why she wants a divorce. I do think the film couldve done a better job to flesh out the predominant ""selfsihness"" idea around the movie but thats just me.",e6l8bc

fajb64q,"One other observation: We all choose what kind of people we want to be.  Alan Alda's character really proved this to be the case.  Even in one of the most contentious fields of law, he chose the high road. He chose humanity and morality.  We all have that same choice every day of our lives.

Showing both sides of the story, nicoles and charlies, was very well done. Though, i had much more sympathy for charlie and felt really bad for him a lot of times, ie. when his son chooses his mother over him, even though he just flew 3000 miles.

I felt angry at nicole a lot of times, for going to the lawyers behind charlies back and for somehow turning their son on charlie. 

I feel like things might be different, if we would have seen charlie cheating on nicole. Then again, we didnt really witness the whole emotional neglect nicole was doing to charlie. 

As others have said, i thought the letter scene in the end was a little bit too much on the nose.

fage62e,"Liked the movie a lot.  Driver's performance was excellent.  I wish there was a scene (or a couple of scenes) that set up Nicole's earlier choices more.  I think I would've connected with her character more throughout the film.  As it stands she comes off a bit callous and selfish, but less so if you take her dialogue at face value, which the film seems to want us to do.  As someone who hasn't been through a divorce, it feels authentic.  Definitely not Scarlett Johansson's best performance but very good nonetheless

EDIT:  Another problem I have with the way Nicole's character was shown is that she is self-admittedly indecisive and unsure of what she wants.  This led me to wonder how clear she actually was to Charlie about her needs before she went to Nora.  I really wish we could have gotten a concrete scene of her stating her needs to Charlie and him dismissing or ignoring them.  Being uncertain of your own needs and wants is ENTIRELY your fault.  And it's possibly because I had a relationship with someone who was completely unsure of their goals and desires, yet still blamed me for their unhappiness, that it really stuck out to me in the film.",e6l8bc

fapypoh,I might get downvoted for this but I thought the film was just OK after viewing it again. Yes the acting is very good(especially Driver) and the emotion felt very raw and real but the film never shows why the real reason Charlie and Nicole got together and got married for me to really get connected with them. We do see their letters on what they loved about each other but I couldn't help but compare this film with Blue Valentine which does a far better job going in-depth of the relationship which makes their separation far more heartbreaking to see. Granted this is a film about divorce but I just found to be siding with Charlie and felt Nicole was just being selfish and impractical. Maybe its because I am a man but Blue Valentine hit me far better than Marriage Story without thinking about picking any sides.,e6l8bc

f9vksv3,"This movie made an impact. Of course, the screenplay, direction and acting were off the charts, but earlier this year I came out of a committed relationship that lasted over four years. There was so much in Charlie and Nicole that I recognized. We didn't have a kid, we didn't need lawyers, or needed to file for a divorce. It was just the conversations, the fights, the unspoken emotions these characters had that was so fucking real. My ex and I ended our relationship amicably so that feeling of wanting to have the best for the other, wanting to be polite, to still respect each other is so recognizable, all the while the break-up is tearing you apart emotionally. I love the fact that they still made jokes to each other (""They couldn't smell the salt(?)"", then Nicole chuckles), it's way more realistic than to portray a break-up in which the couple is only fighting all the time. 

But the one big fight they did have, damn... That was such a great scene and also something I could really relate to. Adam Driver shouting he wishes she would die was delivered so, so well. It could've been delivered with rage only, but the fact he started breaking down crying while he said that just completely hit home for me. That feeling of being completely and utterly stuck, getting so incredibly frustrated that you start shouting shit, or throwing stuff, punching walls - and then knowing you're going too far and you just can't believe yourself; can't believe what you're saying to the woman you once loved - then breaking down. And she comforts him, because she knows that's just what he needs right now. 

From the moment the kid read the letter I started crying and I didn't stop until the end of the credits. Just a few days ago I was completely convinced Parasite was gonna be my favourite movie of the year, but now... This movie just hit me. Damn, 2019 is a good movie-year!",e6l8bc

I‚Äôve never talked to either of my parents about what it was like for them, but this film made me realize how I‚Äôve never fully considered how horrible it must have been, and they were so, so young when it happened (20 and 21).

fahuj96,"I liked that at first you're like, hey they seem like they don't need to get divorced but then as the movie progresses you're like, okay yeah maybe they shouldn't be married. And Charlie and Nicole know it too. 

The character descriptions in the beginning set the tone for me and we got to see Charlie and Nicole display those characteristics throughout the movie, especially the respect they have for each other for being a good parent. That is probably the biggest strength they have as a couple and it might be the one thing that keeps them civil in the end. Their love for Henry keeps them civil. Divorce is difficult but very common and very real, and the couples who make it out with respect for each other and mutual love for their child(ren) are really making the best of a bad situation. 

The acting is of course A+ in this, and I was already an Adam Driver fan but always a little eh with Scarlett, who totally changed my views on her in this movie. The emotions flew high when they needed to be, but I also loved the fake ""hey we're cool"" attitude they had with each other when they weren't fighting. But then at the end, it was truly a ""hey we're cool"" attitude that they didn't need to strive for. I mean, maybe not cool, but civil.",e6l8bc

So on to a more functional question..

From: Me (single female), who was in no way dissuaded from marriage by the film...

To: Those who ARE married, who at one time or more could have seen their marriage ending in divorce... (not necessarily unfolding like in the film but divorce nonetheless)

Q: What practical steps did you take to mitigate against this outcome (divorce)?

Yes, I could've asked this question elsewhere, but the content of this film, I feel, perfectly positions its placement.

Note: while I appreciate all answers, I am mostly interested in hearing from the husbands point of view.

Thank you in advance.

fb7tmzs,"I liked the film, but there were a few things that upset me about it. 
The scene where they are in the office with their respective lawyers was weird as they‚Äôre fighting and discussing certain terms of the divorce but then when lunch is mentioned, they all revert back to their normal selves and even praise Charlie. That fight scene was super intense also but it made them seem overall more human. I suppose they were sick of all the layers and got caught up with all the fighting that they forgot how to actually communicate with each other. 
I do feel bad for both characters respectively but for different reasons. I think with Charlie, yes he is controlling but not in a malicious way. I actually think by him doing his plays and having Nicole star in them was a way to try and protect his family and keep them from harm, but it went too far as she felt boxed in and wanted more out of life as she knew she was good. Charlie also knows that his plays are good so perhaps felt like a ¬´¬†provider¬†¬ª I think Charlie is definitely scared of change, possibly linking with his abusive childhood. He should have definitely understood Nicole‚Äôs needs. I can understand his pain of the things that they had initially informally agreed on being voided as soon as Nicole jumped on the lawyer bandwagon. I think they should have tried to amicably sorted stuff out first. Charlie definitely shouldn‚Äôt have slept with that woman though but I feel this was in there to perhaps even the list of bad parts for the both of them. 
I can understand also Nicole‚Äôs need for personal and acting growth but feeling boxed in. She also misses her home state and family as she is close to them, whereas Charlie isn‚Äôt bothered about his parents. Charlie most definitely can‚Äôt see that. While Nicole wants growth, Charlie is afraid of change as he has lived in New York forever and sees LA as more of a holiday type thing. I don‚Äôt think Nicole should have listened about getting that lawyer because she was absolutely horrid! The nature of divorce lawyers seems savage and I am not envious of their job at all. I think perhaps Nicole should have tried to talk with Charlie a bit more as, to me at least, she perhaps only mentioned it in passing and was made out somewhat that Charlie doesn‚Äôt listen, but says in her letter that he listens to her moods. They do, however, want the best for their son at the end of the day. Charlie‚Äôs character had way more growth I feel. They were both really frustrated at the whole process at the end of the day. Great film but a difficult watch for the sake of my emotions",e6l8bc

The acting by the main cast was amazing, but I don't feel like in combination with the supporting cast I would call it impeccable. There are some characters that are just so good it exasperates the average acting of some other characters. 9/10

The cinematography wasn't too special. There were some wonderfully done camera pans, which I wish they would have highlighted more in the shooting of the movie. But it wasn't terrible. 7.5/10

fclu0ll,"Saw the movie after a friend recommended it. And I really enjoyed the acting and the relatable situations.

Watching it, I felt very emotionally mixed. Based on the first scenes, I had expected that there would be something more equal. Nicole talks about what she likes about Charlie, Charlie talks about what he likes about Nicole. And then it's revealed that they're getting ready to separate.. and I think that's a nice setup.

But in some ways, I felt like the film sympathized a lot more with Nicole's situation...which kind of disappointed me from a filmwatching perspective.

On one hand, I felt like Nicole was right in a lot of ways. She felt stifled by Charlie, that Charlie always assumed that his desires were the same as Nicole's and represented the rest of the family. Little moments where Charlie criticizes her hair and says he prefers longer hair, to criticisms about her acting, you could tell that there was tension and frustration building up. Although he does care about the theater company, his caring about others does come at the expense of his own family's desires and could also be selfish in its own way. When Nicole had repeatedly expressed a desire to go to LA, Charlie seemed to shut it down. He would be willing to go to Copenhagen to direct a play and further his own ambitions, but he turned down an opportunity to go to LA despite Nicole's desires.

But I expected Charlie to at least have some good points from his view, just from a film-watching perspective; I find it more interesting when each side has good points but he came off as far more flawed. He tends to be more strict and impatient with Henry, a bit more demanding about what he wants. He drags around Henry for what he imagines would be fun rather than what Henry wants. Adam Driver's acting makes you sympathize with his character in some ways, but his actions often don't really help his case.

To the film's credit, Laura Dern's character seems to acknowledge this; mothers are expected to be perfect while fathers can be flawed but still hold sympathy. The film itself could be reflecting that.

I get that this is pretty subjective; I know a lot of other viewers felt that the movie was pretty equal while others sided more strongly with one side.

Other commenters have mentioned that the film is a role reversal; Nicole felt stifled during the marriage and the film depicts her with more success; she has a large advantage in divorce proceedings and the custody, she's in her hometown with family close by, her son is with her, she has more opportunities . Charlie is the one who has to gradually develop and change. Perhaps that's the mindset that I should think with instead of my initial expectations.

In general, I think the film has a greater focus on Charlie, but more sympathy for Nicole.",e6l8bc
f9vvkdq,"As someone whose almost a year into being single after being in a committed relationship of 4 years with a now 4 year old, this movie hit pretty hard for me. The portrayal of a breakup being agreed to being amicable can turn sour so quickly is so accurate. Luckily for me and my ex we didn't get any lawyers involved (we are in Australia so the courts work differently to the ones in the movie). I'm glad the characters were able to set aside their differences in the best interest of the child. The argument scene was what really got to me the most, as my ex and I had the same argument shortly after breaking up. It's 4 years worth of frustrations that is never brought up that explodes as you both feel like you have nothing left to lose, until you remember that violence from anyone's side can be used against us if either of us decided to take each other to court to gain custody of our DS. 10/10 movie, would rewatch again.",e6l8bc

Laura Dern is deserving of her Supporting awards this award season, also Ray Liotta and Alan Alda shine in smaller parts. But for me this is Adam Driver's film, I know some see Greta Gerwig as Noah Baumbach's muse but Driver gives her a run for it. Driver is fantastic and if it wasn't for Phoenix era defining performance in Joker, he'd have won Best Actor.

Noah Baumbach is a weird director for me, he can produce a film like Francis Ha (still his masterpiece for me) Marriage Story or The Squiad and The Whale.

Both he and Scarlett Johansson were great, especially during that fight scene. This really affirmed my fear of divorce. Julie Hagerty as Scar Jo's mom is great. She's hilarious in everything she's in. Alan Alda somehow balances silly old man and competent lawyer simultaneously. There are so many movies this year with great casts (Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, JoJo Rabbit, Knives Out), but if there was an Oscar for ""Best Ensemble Cast"" I think this one should get it.

I loved the detail showing the lawyers in a heated argument suddenly stop and order lunch like old pals, like real lawyers. and as much as I hated Scar Jo's lawyer, her line ""Ah, so it's a discussion when it's something she wants and a deal when it's something you want?"" really stood out to me.

Noah Baumbach‚Äôs script & direction were top-notch. His real-life experience with divorce most likely definitely played a huge part in the realization of this movie. I‚Äôd use the phrase ‚Äúlife imitates art,‚Äù but it‚Äôs really ‚Äúart imitating life‚Äù for this film.

fcy2e50,"Maybe some one here can help me understand the scene with Scarlett and Laura when they are first meeting. Laura asks for Scarlett's side of the story. Scarlett then delivers a scatter brained monologue while she wanders around Laura's office and doing random things. She get's some lip moisturizer, wanders into the bathroom for a kleenex (even though Laura placed a box on the table in front of them). She can't concentrate on what she is saying because she keeps commenting on the tea and cookies and just keeps wandering around. It was really distracting to me and I don't really understand why they chose to have her character to do that. The only thing I can think of is Laura asks Scarlett what she wants and she can't effectively convey what she wants because she doesn't know. does any one here have a different take on the scene. Adam's character doesn't have an opportunity to verbalize his point of view so we don't really get both sides of the story. we don't know how often she made comments about wanting to move to L.A. She may have not communicated to him how she felt about moving or if she ever even said that she wanted to move there.",e6l8bc
ff2iwnb,"One thing that I like about the movie is that it was understated in the way it told its story. It could have gone way further, but it decided to go for a more realistic style in order to be relatable. 

Adam Driver's performance is incredible. I love that Charlie is shown to mostly be keeping his struggle internal. Throughout the film he never really has anyone. The climactic fight scene was insanely real. I've had a really bitter breakup before and found Driver really nailed the little things in breaking down. His silent breakdown after the observer leaves was also weirdly relatable. 

Overall, a really good film. To me this film screams ""watch out Hollywood"" in the way that The Irishman was supposed to.",e6l8bc

Not saying ScarJo was ugly in this at all, but she just looked so defeated and exhausted throughout this thing. She LOOKED like a mother in the process of a divorce.

In the argument scene, he did such an incredible job showing what a person looked like if a person was a ticking time bomb being pushed to its limit.

fbzs56e,"Fantastic movie. When I suggested watching it, my dad was skeptical because ""\[he doesn't\] like Kylo Ren"" (I then argued that that is the point), but afterwards the first thing he said was that Adam Driver is a great actor. I think he's very good at portraying angst, both brooding and explosive, and this manifests in both Kylo Ren and Charlie (I regrettably haven't seen him in anything else yet). My heart was breaking for him whenever Henry would choose his mom, although obviously Charlie is far from an angel. 

Of course, ScarJo delivered a powerful performance as well - Nicole's first meeting with Nora was wonderfully acted. The climactic fight scene between the two leads was as riveting and devastating as you'd expect, but also had me laughing in spite of myself at how dumb and cruel the things they said were. Both characters' singing scenes were also charismatic and entertaining, and the lyrics to the songs were a nice touch, even if they weren't exactly subtle (similar to the closing gate shot).

Other moments that stood out to me... Nora's mother/Mary Magdalene monologue was great. The social worker who came in to observe Charlie and Henry was hilariously awkward to the point of being unrealistic, as was Charlie cutting himself and then helping her open the door. He really should've covered the dent with a drawing, too. Maybe a dumb comparison, but the discussion about the pie in the envelope scene reminded me of the fish discussion in The Irishman, which I watched recently - both are random, overly detailed conversations about food that add some humor into an emotionally tense situation.

I think it‚Äôs meant to be ironic. They originally set out to do this all on their own, and then they let lawyers, and money, and brutal fights get in the way, only for them to really do it on their own in the end anyway.

Not to mention those perfect first 10 minutes that set up so many great small moments throughout and one heartbreaking ending, really made you feel like you knew these two people, making it evermore devastating. 

I'll give a massive shout out to the editing in particular as I feel most will overlook it. So many intergal scenes were paced phenomenally, especially the main argument scene.

They had decided to end their relationship in a mature way, but she had to make everything difficult and expensive. I do agree that they maybe needed to split up, but it was blown out of proportion.

Amidst the savage and bloodthirsty divorce proceedings, there are still remnants of love between the two main characters, Nicole and Charlie.

The story of their marriage begins to unfold as they are discussing their separation, which snowballs quickly when divorce lawyers start to come into the picture.

When they are close to having no means left to pay for their lawyers on top of having to involve their young son on court matter, they are forced to talk it out among themselves without outsiders.

This is the first time on the movie where they remove their filters towards each other and face each other properly. Their dialogue is so full of resentment and anger that have been accumulating during the course of their marriage. A very powerful scene filled with raw emotions - realism at its finest.

Not to mention the ending scenes where Charlie ended up reading Nicole‚Äôs letter (in regards to Charlie) that she refused to read out loud during their counseling session is extremely heartbreaking.

few3jdl,"I would like to ask all who have given their ideas on the movie if you have or have not actually gone through a divorce and children are involved, especially with distance between the parents...I loved the movie, but hated (reminded of) the similarity of my own experience...I think for the individuals who have gone through this experience can relate on some level the process they both went through (attempted counseling and lawyers). It shows the good times and bad times (Not necessarily in that order) of the relationship. Meeting someone and falling in love doesn't always end happily every after even though that's what is the intended goal. I thought the acting (Showing their emotions!) was wonderful. I do think both parents portrayed their best for the interest of the son's well being while deep inside still wanting different endgames for themselves. All I want to say is that just from the big picture - not all divorces are the same, but can easily be described as things changed after the vows are spoken. 

I loved both Charlotte's and Adam's rendition of being parents. The movie tackles the roller coaster of the love for each other as well as what it takes to keep their son first priority. It is not a happy ending but it is an ending that I think a lot of divorces couples can relate with.",e6l8bc
fboglor,"I loved the movie until the end. I actually didn't like the ending all that much, especially the part where the kid is reading Nicole's letter (which was for marriage counseling). In addition, while Adam Driver sang very well, I didn't like that scene, either. Both scenes felt too on the nose compared to the rest of the film. That's my opinion. I can't really explain why I feel this way, but I really think that if they skipped those two scenes altogether, the movie would be a 10/10.

(EDIT: The knife scene was also a bit too-on-the-nose as well, I forgot. That scene bothered me a bit more than the other two scenes, actually. There were definitely other ways to show Charlie's emotional state.)

My favorite part is the boxing match with words arguing scene. That was amazing acting from both. When Nicole kept saying ‚ÄúHoney‚Äù even if they are arguing, that truly says something.

I did, however, think it was a very realistic display of a breakdown of a relationship. I related very much to the letters in the beginning and also their argument. It's amazing how spot on that was. 

&#x200B;

I have several friends who have gone through a divorce and the legal proceedings/lawyers were spot on. Divorce is so expensive too...many people actually can't afford a divorce, I have heard of couples who are separated and live together for years and years just because it's too much money/time.

&#x200B;

I couldn't even take sides because I found myself sympathetic to both. A bit more sympathetic towards Nicole but probably because I relate to her more. It did seem to be a bit more male centric and told in the gaze of Charlie. We see him doing more of the struggling and we don't see as much of her process which I would have liked.

fad3crl,"I'm a Baumbach fan and honestly I didn't like this as much as I expected to, given the high expectations set by reviews. Was it bad? No. I enjoyed it, but I prefer The Squid & The Whale and Frances Ha, and maybe even Greenberg. Baumbach's movies tend to resonate strongly with me because I come from a similar background and know a lot of people like the characters in his movies. That's why I probably relate to something like Greenberg more than the average person, whereas the subject matter of this particular film (divorce) is a lot more universal, which might explain its broader appeal. 

I'm guessing this is partially autobiographical. A lot of Baumbach's films seem to draw inspiration from his own life. This seems like a thinly-veiled retelling of his divorce from Jennifer Jason Leigh, and you can certainly see elements of Baumbach in the Driver character. 

Anyway, in some respects I see Baumbach as the new Woody Allen. He has a relatively narrow ""type"" of movie that he makes, but the quality is consistently high and it's refreshing change of pace from brainless blockbusters and genre movies. There's a natural, confident quality of his movies that I admire.",e6l8bc

f9xcuyn,"The performances were phenomenal. Driver is a movie star and I can't wait to see where his career goes. ScarJo's reaction to Driver moving to LA at the end was just incredible. She added so much to the end of that movie with just her weary and pained smile. 

Loved how real it felt. The characters were easy to empathize with and they weren't caricatures. The lawyers were great too. Liotta's speech about how you have to match crazy with crazy was dead-on. 

Ultimately I was a little bit underwhelmed. For as much as the movie focuses on Driver's experience, I don't feel like we learn much about Driver or understand where  he's at. Is he really just a guy who sees everything through the lens of his work and didn't really want to get married, but loves his kid? it's ambiguous whether he wants to break up or stay together. 

ScarJo's character's actions and emotions feel earned. But, while we see Driver's character get emotional and react, I'm not sure I ever get where it's coming from. Like, when she screams at him that she's already lost because she wanted to be married, I felt that and understood what she was conveying because of her previous  scene with Dern, but at the end of that scene  I  still don't know what Driver's feeling about everything other than he's upset about having to go through the experience.",e6l8bc

I felt that the plot development could have been a little better as some scenes that were related to Adam's theatre had more screen time than the plot involving divorce.

Scar Jo's portrayal of a women who got little to no credit from her husband was a realistic portrayal of so many women who have been caught in similar cobwebs but are unable to come out of it.",e6l8bc
fao3q4y,"I am very surprised by the reception this film is getting. Don't get me wrong, the acting was very good, and the movie did a great job following what an actual divorce process would look like. The problem is, that divorce litigation is pretty dry, and despite the emotion shown by the characters, the plot was not meaningful at all. Most inexplicably to me was when the writers set up a great moment and then let it go: Nicole could have honored the 50/50 split to show what we all saw, that she still cared for Charlie on some level. But all she did was hesitate and take the 55/45.

Again, the acting was great, and it was well-shot, but none of the actions or thoughts from the characters seem to have any significant meaning... they were simply going through a divorce and that was it. Don't see why this story line was made into a movie.",e6l8bc

I have never watched a Baumbach movie before, so I didnt even know what to expect but he is pretty fucking good, this is an excellent movie..... it was so well written too..... the pacing was perfect.

This is similar to Manchester by The Sea for me, both movies have touched me on an emotional level I didnt expect. Casey Affleck rightfully won his oscar that year and so should Adam Driver, and like that movie had other powerful perfomances here also they are so many. Scar Jo was amazing, so was Laura Dern and even Liotta and Alan Alda in their cameos. Amazing film and hats off to the entire crew behind this film.

fahjc9w,"Ok, I think the film attempted to make the characters seem equally at fault but I found myself siding with Charlie. Nicole really goes above and beyond to screw him over. Even if she hated him, her actions were going to deprive Charlie of his fatherhood. The scene where he was talking to his lawyer and said something along the lines of ""I'll never be able to be his father again"" really hit me. If Nicole got full custody in LA and ""won"" the divorce, Charlie would lose his family. He would never be a real father to his son ever again, he would just be in the background. 

The thing I really took from this movie though, is that it seemed like the couple quit too soon. I sympathized with Nicole's struggles as a wife and mother feeling as if she lost her identity, but did she ever communicate this to Charlie? And I mean really communicate it. It seemed like they could have tried to save the marriage but divorce was their first resort. In the beginning, it is clear Nicole had wonderful things to say about Charlie but she was too angry and stubborn to speak with the mediator. I understand that feeling, but it seems like she wasn't really trying to work things out. This isn't to say Charlie was perfect, I think he let her walk away too easily. He was the calmer one and he seemed to be very understanding in the beginning, but this manifested in Charlie simply allowing Nicole to walk away. The notion that things could have been mended between the couple was very apparent to me when, in the end, Charlie tells Nicole he got a job at UCLA. At that moment it seemed like they realized, ""Wow. We could have compromised. We could have made this work if we had tried.""",e6l8bc

I never really got a sense that either of these people had a great passion for New York play directing or LA film acting. They honestly felt more like light hearted go with the flow type people. 

The best scene was definitely the big argument scene in the apartment, but again it just was out of context with the rest of the movie. I never got the sense that either hated each other or either was particularly sad that their careers or lives didn‚Äôt turn out the way they wanted them to.",e6l8bc

It was said that she basically woke up one day unhappy because she was unable to pursue her goals, so she made him sleep on the couch, withholding sex for one year. Cheating is never ok but that was extremely mean to do to him.  Also, look at what a capital C U Next Tuesday her lawyer is. His lawyers were simply defending his time with his child. She is the one who filed, he seems grounded throughout the film while she is going nuclear until he finally loses it in the end. The poor bastard was being railroaded by the system and his wife was using the kid as a pawn. Her lawyer was so happy in the end when she ""won"" but Nicole said she didn't want to ""win"", then why the f did you hire a lawyer when you agreed on no lawyers.

Depending on your life experience you may side with Nicole or Charlie. I found myself understanding Charlie's view point much more throughly than Nicole's but can also rationalize it as relating to his struggles as a man trying his best to care for his kid. Those with infidelity in their past relationships might immediately side with Nicole.

Any of these opinions is totally valid and it speaks to the greatness of the film in that we are all seeing the same event play out on screen but rationalize and relate completely differently.

Driver and ScarJo give amazing performances, specifically Scarlett's first scene in the lawyers office and Driver's scene in the apartment. Masterclass in both cases.",e6l8bc
f9vbc7d,"I saw it a week ago, so it had some room to settle. I still think this is not only my favorite movie of this year, but perhaps of this decade. The way information about Charlie and Nicole is given to the viewer is incredibly immersing and I feel like throughout the movie there's an amazingly delicate balance in whose side you are 'on' that's almost impossible to attain. Aside from being incredibly moving and, at least for myself, causing introspection about the way I treat other people, it is also just funny as shit.

I feel like this movie shouldn't work for me based on my tastes but it does. It really, really does. Funnily enough I find it hard to recommend to friends and family, even though I absolutely loved it. It's an incredibly tense drama but with quite a lot of (occasionally crude) humor and even two musical scenes at the end. It could've easily been a bad film if it wasn't so well-written, well-acted, and well-shot.

Both Johansson and Driver were great. Driver is almost always good and so i expected him to be good and he delivered it but Johnansson pleasantly surprised me. I was glued to the screen and held my breath for her 'I got small' scene. She would make a worthy winner at the Oscars.",e6l8bc

In the scene where Driver and Johansson are yelling at each other in the apartment and then he breaks down, all I kept thinking is, ‚ÄúWhere was this for Kylo Ren!?‚Äù The hatred in his face and voice coming from a place of such despair is what I have wanted to see from Kylo Ren.

The fight scene was the most emotional by far but I also found the court scene hard to watch as well because as the lawyers were fighting the facial expressions of Nicole and Charlie you could tell they hated what was happening and realized they had gone too far down the path to change the course of divorce that they wanted when they started.

The child did a good job of showing that he was not sure exactly what was happening and it made me sad since he had no real grasp of what was happening and how it effected him. He just wanted to be a kid

The only thing that bothered me (but not a big deal) was that they could have made Charlie stay in New York because it made the whole point of the divorce moot when he moved to LA but that was the point of the movie was to show that divorce proceedings are usually messy and if they just communicated more they could have made something work. That's why the letter reading by the kid was so powerful at the end great storytelling since it was at  the beginning as well

f9uxb73,"Is it just me or they just dint connected with Sca Jo's character as the director wanted us to. I mean sure she has some emotional moments here and there but Adam Driver's character was just so relatable that you could really understand his perspective despite him not having to explain everything so precisely as Nicole did to her lawyer. I don't know if its Driver's stage presence or the writing but I really felt for his character. His affair also seemed out of place and felt it was added only to balance out in having to feel with Nicole. By the end, Nicole pretty much won everything.",e6l8bc
fa9hxxp,"Charlie got screwed. I know that‚Äôs not the point of the movie, but he got absolutely taken to the cleaners.",e6l8bc
fc40map,"I finally have had a chance to see Marriage Story and I should admit that it is definitely beyond my expectations. I was expecting to see such a typical and boring drama which is a story of love and hate of husband and wife. However, I saw the self-discovery of a woman and a non-biased perspective of marriage and divorce.  


>!In the beginning, both Nicole and Charlie tell about themselves from their perspectives: their habits, what they like more about themselves and their personalities. One of the interesting points for me is that Nicole does not want to read her feelings unlike Charlie and he put pressure on her to do with the therapist. In my opinion, this is the first sign represented by the director of how Charlie dominates her and her feelings. 
They are not only husband and wife, but also business partners. Nicole left everything behind and moved from New York to LA to live with Charlie to work and be with together. As she expressed, everything belongs to him from the beginning of the relationship: house, furniture, etc. She also indicates that she wants to be director, but Charlie postpones it and always tells her later. After we discover that it is not only for directing, but also moving into LA and other decisions. It is obvious that she is the inferior and weak side of the relationship. On the other hand, she turns the page to a new life and becomes an actress in Hollywood and starts to discover herself.  This is the most crucial part of the movie for me because she suddenly realizes how she has been dominated and undermined by her husband who cheated on her. 
!<

>!From my perspective, this movie is more than being a simple divorce story of a couple, but it represents an awakening of a woman. Eventually, Nicole discovers herself and finds what she wants from life. These days this is the problem of almost every relationship. Rather than sharing their partner and sharing with her, men try to show off their masculinity and strength. They aim to create such obedient and inferior women. Maybe I exaggerate, but this is what I have observed so far. All in all, I am happy to see such a movie that finally tells something also from women's perspective rather than being patriarchal.!<",e6l8bc
fa8siwh,"I'm genuinely confused - are we supposed to feel for Driver's character? I mean, I don't wish a messy divorce on anybody, but he had very little if any redeemable qualities on display throughout the film and generally treated her pretty horribly when she was pretty much nothing but amicable.

Then towards the end her story kind of gets lost and the focus is more on Driver and I get the sense Baumbach wanted us to feel bad for him but he was generally just kind of a self absorbed dick.

Idk, maybe just not my cup of tea. I went in thinking it'd be the dissolution of a marriage where both were decent people and a portrayal of how even good people can be mean, go through these things, etc.",e6l8bc
faizhzx,"Man it was a great film but there were just some scenes that I hated. I hated the scene with Nicole's sister trying to give him the divorce papers; it was so poorly done in that it was trying to be cringey and awkward bc divorces are but it was so annoying and difficult to watch. I'm sorry but that actress just wrecked the scene in an awful way. I understand why Charlie does his song near the end of the movie but I felt that it was weird and off even if I did enjoy it. Also I thought that the movie made it too clear that Charlie was mostly in the wrong in the fight because he seriously was such an asshole in cheating on her and controlling/dominating his wife so that she had no sense of self. Otherwise, another stellar film by Noah Baumbach.",e6l8bc
fdri657,"She also grew up in a family with large quantities of acting experience, she had been involved from day one in one fashion or another.  But fair enough argument. It was def a stretch for her to get that recognition so soon. If I knew more of the Baumbach marriage story this movie is inspired from maybe I could look for a reason why he felt this achievement by Nicole was important enough to include so early in her LA career. Maybe someone here does? I suppose even though he totally gets shafted and doesn‚Äôt deserve his personal dreams, career and financial stability to be reduced to nothing bc he and his wife didn‚Äôt work out, it is powerful to the viewer. Makes you contemplate and realize that how you may consciously or unconsciously neglect your loved ones in life can have extremely serious and permanent life-altering consequences. One of my biggest struggles with this movie is that Charlies character has inconsistencies with his core characteristics? That in a mentally stable person is highly unlikely. He‚Äôs a great dad but his son doesn‚Äôt seem to love him much? He treats his son poorly at times? He can‚Äôt avoid how the separation impacts the way he interacts with his son. I suppose that‚Äôs how it goes often in reality. So I appreciate that. I started my life with my stepdad from age two so I can‚Äôt speak as a child who saw the separation of my birth parents. People can be great AND bad, especially under immense stress. But deep core values like what Nicole has to say about him seem to not be shown as clearly. Perhaps that‚Äôs the thing, she saw the best version of him instead of the whole one.  Maybe he chose to make other coworkers feel so much like family to feed his need to be seen as a great director and bc he cared. Can those two desires coexist truly? 

I think Nicole reveals herself to be much more selfish and controlling in the end. Why? Bc it‚Äôs deliberate, while Charlie‚Äôs are due to lack of contentiousness. She knew he was going to Broadway, she served him knowing he‚Äôd be forced to begin the process of lawyering up in LA. She did everything on her terms and turf. She had to have known the financial ruin doing it in LA would take from him, knowing it would cost him not only more money but that he couldn‚Äôt earn money while doing this. She didn‚Äôt want to leave him penniless but she robbed him of his promising future. And it can‚Äôt really be argued she wouldn‚Äôt have known this with someone like Nora who coached her through every step.  She took it away imo to attempt to strip him of his overly dignified sense of righteousness (in her POV), trying to humble him. I‚Äôm glad he did learn to be more humble but this was not the right way. It‚Äôs a toxic form of exerting control (which she lacked in her life), when you force them to bend to your desire like that. So is he even truly humble now? Or is he forced to be so? Could he have gotten there another healthier way? That option was taken from him. When you factor in the idea that they weren‚Äôt sleeping together for a year before he cheated you start to understand that the romance was dead, their marriage was over in all but legal terms. They only stayed together for their son. I have friends who‚Äôs parents went 18 years before separating bc they knew it was best and would provide more money for their child‚Äôs future than separating before they could save up for divorce AND things like college for the kid. Nicole chose to be selfish and take from Charlie and her sons future, so she could have what she always needed. My moral/ethical teachings tell me she chose to save herself rather than the other two people in potential harms way. Two futures traded for one. And that‚Äôs morally wrong to a degree. She comes off highly vindictive. I accepted that to be true the moment she let out all her true feelings on the phone with Charlie at the party. It put her actions, which at first seemed out of character, into perspective. I finished the movie not siding either way. Knowing  no one was meant to be the ‚Äúwinner.‚Äù By comparison though she did win after the dust settles. She gains everything while he loses ALL but his son, which he lost 55% of in a sense. Maybe no one here is starkly the sole villain, but the winner and loser are plainly obvious. She chose this. And that ultimately makes me side with him. Humans are innately flawed. No one is perfect. She can‚Äôt love him for his tidiness and hate him for his need to keep things highly in order. When you love you have to love for who that person is not who you want them to be in your fantasy marriage. The good and the bad are part of the package. She chose to be with him. We never got to see how she actually spoke up for herself and her desires. It‚Äôs hearsay. He‚Äôs able to remember inside jokes with temps but not be aware of his wife‚Äôs true NEED to be in LA for a time? I don‚Äôt buy that ? He married her and loved her but he‚Äôs more attentive and inclusive to a temp? She admits she meshed with him, lost herself in his world. That‚Äôs not his fault. He was just Pursuing his career. She didn‚Äôt know she wasn‚Äôt okay with her life until later in their relationship. She failed to communicate that, bc she didn‚Äôt see it clearly. 20/20 is a bitch. The fact she took everything from him that allowed him to feel free to express himself is what makes me choose to side more with Charlie. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs a villain but what she did might as well be criminal. The motive is there, the intent to cause harm is there and the prior intent is there.",e6l8bc
faa1frj,"During the argument scene, Adam Driver goes from normal Adam Driver (which is already a big dude) size to being shot like Godzilla. 

On a related note, all of the close ups really break down the two leads from being *characters* to being just humans.  No ones made up, everyone‚Äôs  got blemishes etc.

Ray Liotta is absolutely savage.  Not an ounce of the tongue in cheek characters he seems always play.

Laura Dern made my skin crawl from the moment she was on screen.  I hated her intonations, her mannerisms.  Everything.  I don‚Äôt know if you can call her a ‚Äúvillain,‚Äù but she‚Äôs the closest thing the film has.

I will continue to believe that every Alan Alda character is an extended universe version of Hawkeye Pierce, exponentially gaining wisdom until he‚Äôs one with the universe.

fadtlyg,"Very good movie, but I wasn't blown away the way I expected to be after waiting for this movie all year long and reading all the praise and acclaim that has been lauded on it for months on end. I honestly prefer a few other Baumbach movies over it if I were ranking them, movies that resonated with me in a much more impactful way even though I was most definitely in the target audience for this one. 

But, really, the performances by Driver and Scarlet were outstanding, especially considering what they had to shoulder in these huge, unbroken monologues where their emotions are running the gamut. I feel like that's the one thing that's undeniable no matter what people's feelings fall on the film. The pair of them knocked it out of the park and most definitely deserve to be nominated in any and every acting category they're eligible for. I'd throw Laura Dern into that conversation as well, just fantastic work from her and a great kick-in-the-ass to Hollywood to remind them that this actress deserves more than just supporting roles here and there.  

That said, I had a few issues with the pacing here and there, some of the scenes dragged or were redundant like Driver's second Halloween excursion with his son. I would have much rather a little time had been set aside showcasing Driver's actual stage-directing prowess considering it's such a crucial part of the plot throughout the film. I just found some of the decisions on what Baumbach included or didn't include a bit baffling, whereas I never really have that feeling in his other movies where everything feels like it's exactly where it should be. 

I think drama schools of the future will study the BIG FIGHT between ScarJo and Driver in his new house as a masterclass in acting. But the one thing that really bothered me most about the script in that scene was how quickly ScarJo shrugged off Adam Driver telling her that he wakes up each morning wishing she were DEAD or was KILLED (!). I mean, the audience feels like it's been kicked in the stomach when he spews such a venomous barb at her, so it surprisingly robs that moment of its impact when, not even a few seconds later, she's consoling him because he squirted out some tears! How does her character go from getting *that* thrown in her face to instantly comforting the perpetrator who just went for her throat in such a vicious and violent way??  The turnaround was too quick there, that's not how humans operate. 

Overall though it was a great film that, once again, I built up far too grandly in my head through months and months of anticipation and probably set myself up to be disappointed when it didn't meet my insurmountable expectations.",e6l8bc
fdax6rk,"There was a remark made by Nicole that Charlie was from home where alcohol was involved. To her it may seemed that the problem was within Charlie, who was going the opposite way: from broken home to a successful artist. And because her family has an history of accomplishments in the entertainment industry, makes her more superior than him?

It maybe be like that. I recognise myself in Charlie. I haven‚Äôt had much in life, but managed to achieve one major goal in life. A spectator might notice, that some of my needs are met by manipulation and being selfish, egoistic. Just like Charlie had been. Will you say that Charlie lacked some of the basic personality traits that Nicole already equipped? If yes, what traits should he acquire?",e6l8bc

fa63fk1,"Not normally my kind of movie but holy shit. I didnt look at my phone once throughout the movie.

far and away the most realistic depiction of arguments in relationships ive ever seen in film

Characters with so many levels

sad and surprisingly funny.  


Just a question about the last scene where Adam Driver tells Johansson he wont be here for a while because hes directing two plays somewhere else, and she looks a tiny bit taken aback, and he asks ""are you ok?""   
Thats him being a dick right? Because the whole movie he always asks her if shes ok to get a rise out of her knowing shes not ok with what hes just said? Or am i misinterpreting that?",e6l8bc
faa61e4,"Man, as someone who is ignored by both of his parents throughout my life and has vowed not to treat my child the same way as my parents did, Driver's love for his son is so relatable and heartbreaking to watch. When you loathe your parents as much as Charlie did you try everything to be not like them in any sense. When Charlie and S Jo's character are having that big fight and she says he is just like his father and he snaps completely I really felt that. You can take every insult but that that becomes just unbearable.",e6l8bc
fawfl0k,"Just seen the movie. A few points that came up in my mind:

- It seemed more like Charlie‚Äôs than Nicole‚Äôs story, don‚Äôt know why. Did Charlie have more screen time or is it because I‚Äôm a man?

- The movie probably was meant to equally show the struggles of both partners. Still, I could relate more with Charlie than with Nicole. (Again, is this a male thing? Really wondering here...)
Nicole really seemed .. well, mean. Things could have worked out just fine, if she hadn‚Äôt came up with the attorney first.

- Adam Driver‚Äôs performance was outstanding and I‚Äôm saying that as a person who absolutely hated him in the late Star Wars movies. Truly perfect here. 

- Scarlet Johansson was good, too. Not that outstanding, I‚Äôd say, because I‚Äôve seen her in similar roles already.

- Why haven‚Äôt we heard the background story of Charlie banging that other woman? It would have be interesting to see, maybe in a flashback, what led him to that affair, because it destroys his rather perfect husband image. 

- I disliked the kid. What an ungrateful little bastard. Kidding here, but the kid really was unlikeable.

- What was wrong with that lady that visited Charlie and his son? Seriously. 

To sum it up:
This was not what I had expected, but it sure was an entertaining and yet so humane movie, with a compelling story and a fine cast. Hope this one wins awards.",e6l8bc
f9xib8x,"I've never had a film make me feel such a wide variety of intense reactions. From joy to absolute fucking despair.

What a master class. I loved Joker and think Phoenix should win, but holy hell if Driver's performance isn't equally incredible. ScarJo gives her best performance since Under the Skin and reminded me she isn't just Black Widow, but is one of the best working actors out there.

I found the irony of her hatred of not having a voice when with Charlie and hating how his decisions became ""their"" decisions very interesting when thinking about Nora. Nora did everything to her that Charlie did.",e6l8bc
f9vrodh,"I'm not sure that making Charlie a cheater was necessary, it was enough that he was neglectful and self-centered. Him being unfaithful is too easy a reason to be on Nicole's side, maybe they just wanted to spice up the animosity. 

As balanced and impartial as the film was trying to be, I couldn't help but sympathise more for Charlie during the legal battle. I totally understood why Nicole left him and moved to LA but things were just so stacked against him that I felt it was unfair. Him being a shitty husband doesn't negate what a good father he was but his punishment for the former ended up severely affecting his relationship with his son which was harsh. Was it right that Nicole uprooted Henry's life in New York to suit her own? She has a right to live her life the way she wants but when you have a child these types of decisions need way more consideration.

I was really impressed with this film. The two leads were terrific, their lawyers were beautifully odious and there was enough warmth and heart to keep the story poignant and emotionally satisfying.",e6l8bc

f9wc5fg,"Literally just finished watching this, and while it was very good I didn't really connect with it the way some of the other responses have. I'm hardly a Noah Baumbach expert but that's how I've historically felt about his movies, I tend to think they have great pieces, whether that is performances or moments or scenes, but I've never really had an emotional connection to his films.

The great pieces in this: Both of the lead performances. I was thinking as I was watching it that if I had an awards ballot, right now Scarlett Johansson would be both my best supporting actress (for Jojo Rabbit) and best lead actress (for this). Laura Dern and Alan Alda especially are great in supporting roles, but the supporting cast is good all around. Both of the fight scenes are great. The one in the apartment is obviously the Oscar reel moment, but their fight over the phone and Nicole's reaction isn't getting enough credit. The evaluator scene was my favorite of the entire movie. From the awkward introduction to the interviews, to the dinner, to the knife thing, it was incredible.

Anyway this is the type of movie that I'm glad is getting made even if it wasn't for me.",e6l8bc

But film did not grab me by the throat and having her be a bitch from the start was kind of an obnoxious tell that this story was not going to be 'equal' as it set itself up as being.

There were some really nice moments (when he says he took a job at UCLA and her expression was like 'why the fuck could you not do that for ME' without the dialogue having to say it) but ultimately I'm not sure what the point of it all was.

As someone who lives in NYC and goes to a fair amount of theater - it really distracted me that all that part about his acting troupe seemed like pure fantasy and ungrounded in anything I have seen. I mean, the kinds of experimental stuff done at LaMama would NEVER transfer to Broadway and the people all probably have second jobs as professors or waiters.

Side note, I doubt anyone is going to know what I'm talking about but Scarlett's performance was really Tyne Daley-like in her facial mannerisms - wonder if it was just a coincidence or she watched a bunch of Cagney and Lacey episodes beforehand.",e6l8bc
fa9tuwo,"Tbh- I thought the film was meh, I thought Scarletts characters obliviousness too how hardcore of a lawyer nora was completely ridiculous and created such a annoyingly hard process even harder. It was a lovely story about how romances can end on such frivolous things like differences in mindset can end even the most loving relationships, but I found myself sympathizing with adam drivers character way more, I just found scarletts character extremely idiotic and when adam driver told her ‚Äúshe wanted this life until she didnt anymore then wanted to find any reason to complain‚Äù was completely true, her character was so filled with self pity I couldn‚Äôt get over it.

But im a man so maybe im biased, or maybe the film was portraying her this way aswel as him as an overworking father who truly will not have enough time for his son.

I definitely felt that.

fid803a,"My takeaway is that this was a movie designed to be loved by people on reddit, and not one that really had the conviction to stick with one person being in the wrong, or even both parties being equally blameless. I thought in this more progressive time both of them would be to blame and it would be really sad. In the movie as was I found ScarJo to be so utterly heartless and horrible and poor Charlie to be put upon; but because she's a woman, the movies deems her automatically right, which was compounded by Laura Dern's utterly self righteous turn (which I did not find Oscar worthy at all). If this was supposed to be a takedown of how unfair and one sided divorce is to a man, I didn't get that the sympathies were lying there.

Charlie was self absorbed and maybe deluded, but ScarJo was vindictive and only gets the plot going by insisting she wants the son in LA becuase *that's* where she needs to be for her own career. And we're supposed to roll with it, even though if she was in New York where their life was and her precious dreams were unfulfilled, no one would be taking custody away from her. She upended his life, closed his play, deleted his funds, got what she wanted, and then the movie want us to get to the very ending it could've had anyway without making it so one sided. Very frustrating and stressful, but I can tell why so many critics liked it. I would've preferred a movie where he was more villainous, than one acting like she did nothing wrong by moving to LA- which happened to mean the son came with her and Adam was stuck flying there the rest of his life to visit.

And yes, it annoyed me how they were tv and theater stars, compounding the bubble they lived in and the further unrelatability to the audience- how much more pretentious can you get?",e6l8bc

fcyj3bd,"Man I really wanted to like this movie but I honestly do not see what everyone loves about this movie. I completely agree that Adam Driver delivers an amazing performance, but I feel like he carries most of the movie. The script was great but I feel as if the characters motivations were meaningless. For example, you start of the movie with this divorcing couple who appear to be on good terms with one another, and then when the wife gets the lawyer, that‚Äôs when things get bad between them. And after an hour of them hating one another, the ending scene of the movie shows that they‚Äôre cool with one another just like how they were in the beginning. I understand if the dynamics of their relationship changed, but visually, it appeared no different than it was in the beginning. So it felt like nothing changed.

Secondly, I feel as if though the true loser of the film was the husband. He lost his theater company, the play, his family and ended up working as theater director for a college play. The whole detail of his affair felt like it was shoved in, In order to add some negative aspect to the husband. The only bad part of him was that he put his own dreams I feel in front of his wife? Like ok??. The wife on the other hand acted like a leech to him, I don‚Äôt understand how anyone can defend her. Like I said, I really wanted to like this movie but I couldn‚Äôt",e6l8bc

Especially in scenes where people are talking and they have someone sneeze or talk about lunch, this movie wanted me to say ""wow its so natural and real"", but no, not at all. In some ways, this movie also felt like it wanted to be La La Lands' competitor in terms of realistic love dramas for some reason, minus the musical part. I would say I enjoyed this movie and Adam Driver is an amazing actor, but there were too many scenes and too many lines of dialogue that felt like the movie wanted me to cry or something.",e6l8bc
f9tww1u,"My review via my [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/ccbuddyrider/film/marriage-story-2019/1/) (shameless plug):


Noah Baumbach‚Äôs talent as both a writer and a director have always been his innate ability to toe the line between theatrical and realistic with his characters, offering lovably exaggerated versions of people we know (and in some cases, loathe) without it ever feeling so exaggerated that it becomes parody. And while his previous works, such as The Squid and the Whale and Frances Ha utilize this philosophy to ground the theatrical down to the real, Marriage Story is the inverse, tackling the very real and very painful topic of divorce in such a way that it becomes theatrical. 

From the opening scene, Baumbach makes it clear that this is not a film that‚Äôs going to pick a side. It opens with a wonderful montage of the couple in question (Nicole and Charlie, played by Scarlet Johansson and Adam Driver, respectively) reading a sort of grocery list of the other person‚Äôs most admirable traits, set to a wonderfully cut montage of them in their most intimate family moments. This montage is bookended with their reality; the two are going through separation counseling, to ease their impending divorce. This opening scene serves as a sort of thesis for the entire film, as we spend the next two hours sort of exploring every dimension of the divorce, from the sparks that led to the fire, and the ashes left behind.

As stated previously, Marriage Story is not a film about picking sides. Every moment of weakness or vulnerability felt by one character is almost immediately followed up with a mirroring scene of the other. The film manages to weave a list of these pros and cons of the characters into the story, creating a narrative of action and reaction that becomes an emotional civil war as it starts to unravel. But what makes Marriage Story so much more compelling than other films in this genre, is that it never forgets the root cause of these characters pain. Despite their willingness to go through such a painful process as divorce, we never get the sense it‚Äôs because they want to, so much as it is that they have to. 

There is a scene about a third of the way through the film where Nicole, anticipating Charlie‚Äôs arrival at her mother‚Äôs house, has to strategize a way to ‚Äúserve‚Äù Charlie their divorce papers, a process that she legally can not do herself. Johannson performs this scene in a tenderly militaristic way, making the most efficient choices with a twinge of regret just below the surface, which only becomes more difficult when Charlie arrives with the news that his theater company was awarded a prestigious grant. The way that Johansson abandons her plan without explicitly stating so is a testament to both her performance and the refreshingly real dynamic Baumbach has cultivated for these characters, never forgetting the humanity underneath this ordeal.

Both Johansson and Driver deliver career best performances, that ultimately become the reason why the film works so well. Baumbach has always relied heavily on his actors, as a lot of characters are heavily flawed, and don‚Äôt work on paper. Baumbach relies in his actor‚Äôs to make the flaws he creates charming, and we‚Äôve seen it work his advantage (Greta Gerwig in Frances Ha) and against him (Ben Stiller in While We‚Äôre Young). Johansson and Driver are both firing on all cylinders here, hiding all the pain and heartbreak as best as they can, letting it out in little moments such as their Halloween exchange, and ultimately unleashing it all in one of the most brutal arguments ever put to film. Their argument towards the end of the film serves as as sort of demo reel for human emotion, as they both gradually go from concerned and friendly to almost demonically hateful, winding down into loving regret. This scene is hard to watch, but equally hard to look away from, as both of these actors bare their all in a way that never feels melodramatic, or aware of its own importance. Speaking from a purely performance perspective, this is Baumbach‚Äôs absolute best film.

It feels like Baumbach has been working towards this film his whole career. Marriage Story offers new heights for a lot of Baumbach‚Äôs signature talents; the dialogue is casually theatrical, the performances are heartbreakingly real, and the writing is multi-dimensional and organic. It‚Äôs hard to predict where he‚Äôs going to go from here, but at the very least, he can hopefully become a directorical contractor to actors hoping to get the right script for a shot at an Oscar.",e6l8bc
fagbrwu,"I was VERY taken aback at how badly Nicole went behind his back to totally screw Charlie over. Like I understand wanting custody but she refused to talk about it amicably and then hired the most ruthless lawyer and took everything from him including his grant (as he had to pay for an expensive lawyer plus hers), and she totally turned the kid against him as well.

She went from seeming sweet but neglected by Charlie to the most cold-hearted bitch on the planet, to the point that by the end it was laughable that they could ever even be slightly amicable toward each other as shown at the end.

Driver and Johannson's performances were both good but the writing/ screenplay was sub-par in my opinion, I was also quite bored by the end.",e6l8bc
fb6epbc,"Ugh. Only got a little more than an hour into this and I had to stop. Acting was good. I love Driver and Johansson, but the script was sooooo narcissistic, at least it seemed like it to me. Beautiful people, genius director and brilliant actress feeling so empty and dead inside for no particular reason. This just felt so pretentious. The only people I believed were real were the lawyers.  I guess if I was an actor or director, I might like it, but it didn't resonate at all with me.  It felt like it was an hour of watching boring, shallow, narcissistic people intentionally creating fake drama in their lives.  Is it so hard for Hollywood to imagine real people?  I'm so sick of these self service films.  I think I'll just stop watching anything I see that's about actors or writers or directors. I'm honestly wondering how it could possibly get such high ratings.  Right now I'm in an emotional state of revulsion, but should be open to reason later on if anyone can explain it to me.",e6l8bc

fa1s5e8,"This film broke my heart. Noah Baumbach explores the worst of human behaviour (in marriage) while letting the love and compassion takeover and heal‚Äîit‚Äôs achingly beautiful.

A familiar story world from Noah Baumbach, but the complexity of emotions in this one are extreme yet visceral. The writing is elliptical and thoroughly specific, where every scene carries a clear intent, and every dialogue sounds like a symphony. I love the way Noah shifts through various genres while preserving the tonal quality. There are a very few who direct dialogue (timing and intonation) like Noah does. 

Beautifully shot on 35mm film, the cinematography by (my favourite) Robbie Ryan is economical yet precise‚Äîthe close-up‚Äôs reminded me of Bergman‚Äôs Persona. I really wish I‚Äôd watched it in the cinemas with 35mm projection, to experience the true texture of the Film. 

Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson has my heart. There faces say a lot, but their physical acting is what drove me crazy‚Äîthey‚Äôre consistently outstanding throughout the film. Also, I love how Laura Dern and Ray Liotta add so much value to the ensemble casting.
 
I‚Äôm going to rewatch the ‚ÄòEnvelope Scene‚Äô again, and again, just to admire the masterful staging. 

P.S: When in doubt, choose love.

fa9hui6,Loved the movie and I‚Äôm glad it sheds so much light on the divorce process! It‚Äôs almost like a public service message or a FYI for folks thinking of getting married or divorced. I didn‚Äôt like the fact that Nicole just took the kid to LA with no plans of returning. That‚Äôs Charlie‚Äôs kid too and LA is really far from NYC so she knew she was splitting up father and son because she changed her mind about NYC. That‚Äôs a dick move and I didn‚Äôt have too much empathy for Nicole through most of the movie. And she lawyered up first and it cost them a fortune. I hope the system changes so that it is more fair towards fathers.,e6l8bc

fa0tksq,I thought it was ok. The acting was great and I really liked the start with the why I love him/her letters and thought the downfall of the relationship would then be told from both their perspectives equally but we mostly see Nicole's feelings on it. I know she initiated the divorce so it's easy to focus on what made her unhappy but what was going on in Charlie's mind such as when he decided to sleep with someone else? When he kept denying Nicole the chance to move everyone to LA? I feel a more balanced view would have made the movie stronger.,e6l8bc
fhpbqag,"Nicole was a terrible person and wife. I think this film really shows how one spouse can nearly turn your life upside down in a divorce. While Charlie learns to resolve his problem of being too self centered, Nicole by the ending as done no better to speak up for her wants and desires. Look at how the lawyer split visitation for her own bragging rights while Nicole did nothing to confront her. This is all made worse by how much better of an actor Driver is.",e6l8bc

fcrp3fe,"The film is great, and it ought to be titled Divorce Story or Marriage Legal or something more describe of its appeal. I was worried it was one of the indie films that would be about life and marriage without a plot. 

However it left a bad taste in my mouth regarding the director. The story is somewhat autobiographical of his marriage and divorce to Jennifer Jason Leigh and how he cheated her with Greta Gerwing (who is a lot younger than Leigh too) who he is now married to. And who have both award season movies this year. It makes me uncomfortable to see the Charlie character being portrayed sympathetically regarding the cheating and him saying it was a sacrifice to not sleep many other people in his 20s after he became famous. Of course this isn‚Äôt completely autographical but when you know this backstory and how Hollywood so often minimizes cheating its hard to completely ignore.",e6l8bc
fe6dl3h,"it was well acted but it was too melodramatic and had dialogue and blocking like a stage play. too much of it felt forced and contrived.

or to be more blunt, it's hard to feel sympathy for characters who are constantly self sabotaging and/or too inept to navigate their relationship despite being intelligent enough to be very successful professionally.

 their annoying son was par for the course too... he was basically a mini version of his emotionally stunted parents. he was 8 years old and read at about a kindergarten level. 

the climax of smashing a wall in anger and then crying at his ex wifes knees... lacks the subtlety or catharis of better made family dramas. i actually preferred baumbachs last movie.


...i understand some suspension of disbelief is required for just about any movie but when the basis of the whole conflict stems from charlie not being able to get the relationship back on track and suffering through an extended period of sleeping on the couch, it makes me question what love they actually had. nicole claims to love him but not enough to let him sleep in an actual bed. 

neither take responsibility for their failings in the relationship or as parents, neither really grow on a personal level but are simply forced to face the reality theyve been denying all along and they sure have a strange concept of love.

it was a good 4/5 movie but in my opinion the level of craft beyond the acting is surpassed by a dozen movies this year alone.",e6l8bc

I haven't experienced divorce first-hand, or even second-hand, so it was never going to be *personal* for me, but I still wanted more. (I loved *Kramer vs. Kramer*, for example.)

f9x8ich,"I like how ugly it didn't get. It wasn't a stereotypical dirty divorce or maybe how real divorce would get. They were able to talk it out in some way and still were on friendly terms without either one trying to take everything from the other.

All the lawyers knocked it out of the park with the acting. Dern really nailed the scene of mothers having to be virgin mary and fathers can do bare minimum and that be acceptable, to fathers being fathers now.

Henry was okay. Didn't really care for the kid. But i guess he did his job as just playing a normal kid.

Charlie dressed as The Invisible Man and a ghost are great metaphors, made me sad, man. I did love his singing scene.

The dialogue was straight up Baumbach style. Jumping all over the place but without the hint of indie-ness, his other films kinda have. All the long single takes really showed their acting skills. Also allowing the characters to have conversations from other rooms to show tone.

The only scene I was disappointed in was the scene towards the end when Nicole goes over to Charlie's place in LA and they have that final argument. It just felt so melodramatic that it pulled me out. Sure they get loud. Sure Charlie punches a hole in the wall with a weak-ass punch and sure he breaks down. But it all felt so fake. They do so well the whole movie but when it finally comes down to the last fight scene, it's a bust. They looked like they were just playing how someone would act in an spousal argument without either of them connecting to each others anger. They just played a game of who can get more loud and cliche angry. They were on different wave-lengths.",e6l8bc

Maybe it's me but I thought it missed Gerwig's touch that was apparent in his last three movies (even Meyerowitz, which she didn't write, had it). It's still a lot more gentle and compassionate than his pre-Gerwig films but it doesn't feel as tight or rhythmic at those three Gerwig-influenced films. Great film and all but I still think the Gerwig films are better.
 

It's a shame Alan Alda isn't getting the same recognition as the rest of the cast because he does such an amazing job here.

8/10

Edit: I might be giving this movie less credit than I was initially giving it. Maybe the messiness of this movie was necessary. I've also thought about how the movie both spends more time with Driver's character but also makes him seem like more of an asshole than Nicole. The movie was probably inspired by his divorce with Jennifer Jason Leigh and I'm wondering if he feels some guilt about messing up his past marriage. The Being Alive scene also had me almost be in tears (I've watched the scene twice now and the same reaction both times). I'm moving it up to a 9/10 and see how I feel about that. I still think that the Gerwig films are almost perfect but this might be almost as special as them.",e6l8bc
f9uutix,"Absolutely amazing movie.

&#x200B;

1. Having Ray Liotta play a guy named Jay Marotta should have made me mad, but this movie was able to get away with it. 
2. I think what makes Adam Driver such a compelling actor, beyond his actual ability, is that he is a pretty big, imposing guy, but his face is so vulnerable. The soft jaw and sunken eyes. He can so effectively elicit sympathy from the audience, but also be a completely believable villain. He has a bright future
3. Baumbach's best movie since The Squid and The Whale.
4. I don't know if i'm just a hater, but I can not get behind Scarlett Johansson in these types of Roles. I think maybe she is too hot to be believable? Because in Her I thought she was amazing.

As soon as it came up that Driver cheated on her and the fact he didn't really allow her to pursue her goals and ambitions the way she wanted.

I fucken loved Alan Alda. I'd nominate him but his role was really small. He might be third behind Dafoe and Pesci for me this year. 

I'd still put Driver behind Phoenix but everyone rocked it in this movie. It was also nice to see Johansson crush something like this.",e6l8bc

Why was the Johansson character getting so dirty with the divorce when it seemingly could have been resolved in a way that suited all parties better? We‚Äôre we supposed to think she was insensitive and cruel generally? I thought leaving the film on a scene where she organised her new boyfriend and family to wear a group costume without the boys father was meant to leave us with the idea that she was insensitive to what the breakdown of the relationship and family had done to driver, is this fair?

I really, really liked it. I do have one gripe which is that films that seemingly attempt to be ultra-realistic, when there‚Äôs scenes of movie bullshit, they stick out like they wouldn‚Äôt in a normal film. I bring this up in reference to the kid reading the note at the end, it made for a brilliant and gut-wrenching scene. But why the hell did the kid have that note?

With that being said, I have one big nit-pick. Laura Dern's character gave a pretty important agrument about how women are judged harder than men and even if they're better, society will say they aren't. (Something along those lines.)

I really can‚Äôt describe how amazing I found this film. I‚Äôm sure there are criticisms for many aspects of the film but it was just brilliant. It was clever, gut punching, emotions and decisions felt reasonable and relatable.

f9toxwn,"Randy Newman huh? Jeez. Didn‚Äôt expect that. 

That was just a miserable movie my God. Belongs in the great movies from New York directors who view every marriage as an assured divorce. You‚Äôd swear there has never been an upscale New York happy marriage. And they hate driving. And especially California. 

Acting was great of course, plot was mostly about the gridlock of the catch 22 of divorcing someone you only want the best for yet must relentlessly attack but the personal moments sold it. 

I feel like they should‚Äôve made that kid a little more likable though jeez. It was like every opportunity to make him as dumb as a rock while they‚Äôre fighting tooth and nail for him. I get it, but jeez. 

I think mass audiences are gonna hate this though. I *loved* The Meyerowitz Stories‚Äô evenness more though. I constantly think about that line in it where they say they wished their dad had done more to kinda justify their sorta hatred for him. But this was just miserable and constantly just turns down to a deeper and darker pit when you wish sanity could prevail. 

Like divorce I suppose. 

I‚Äôll probably rewatch *that* scene where they try to come to a solution themselves but otherwise, God it‚Äôs a great movie I‚Äôll never watch again. And honestly....probably not as good as I‚Äôd hoped it‚Äôd be to justify the bitter. I didn‚Äôt think it sold that pitch of *marriage even though we still care about each other deeply on some level* that they‚Äôve been selling. Felt like they made her out to be the ‚Äúvillain‚Äù but added that he cheated on her to kinda balance it out. 

I don‚Äôt know. It feels messy like life is and it gets massive points for that and the acting is great with I think Adam Driver pulling in the stronger performance though she was great throughout. 

I think it‚Äôll get nominated for basically everything but don‚Äôt think it deserves to win them. Maybe screenplay. But I don‚Äôt know, competition is too tough this year. Maybe actress. Yeah.

I feel like there is something special to say about a movie where you can replace the actors with some unknown and it‚Äôs still a great story. But if you replaced Adam and Scarlett it‚Äôs a terrible movie. The story was just so bland to me. If you enjoyed the movie it‚Äôs because you went through a divorce or survived one and could relate to what was being shown. 

Ultimately, I don‚Äôt think I was the target audience. Everything about the movie was exceptional (actors, cinematography, details) except the story. I can‚Äôt empathize so I‚Äôm not emotionally attached. Luckily most of America is divorced and could. Oh well.",e6l8bc

The scene where Charlie accidentally stabs himself was one of the best scenes I've seen this year.

He came from an alcoholic abusive upbringing, enough to make anyone an abusive drug addict while starting out in life, but became successful from nothing. She was a has been, felt dead from a previous marriage and used him to feel happy. He was absolutely right. They had a good life, they were a team, but she destroyed it cuz it wasn't enough for her. To prove my statement, nicole casually threw it in Charlie's face ""I'm directing, now I know what you were so obsessed with"". The look on his face and he just had to swallow that comment. Whatever claims of selfishness she had went out the window.   They were a team in ny, successful and well adjust. In LA, she got her family and sing at her lunch parties w her mom and sis while Charlie was broken. Dishevelled lost everything. Lost his plays, his theater, his theater family lost their jobs, the grant money went to the divorce, who knows what blow his reputation took from misusing the grant money.   The worst of it is he lost all that and halfway lost his relationship with his son, lost 55% of it rather. Oh he gets to hang in the background with fucked up shoes and untied shoelaces.... like a schlep, living in a fucked up apartment with plastic plants.   Fine,  he recovered a little, UCLA, those who cant, teach.  And the calarts theatre vs Broadway is kind of a major downgrade...? He had to restart from scratch again, and all he got for that was a look from his ex, while another man plays with his kid 55% of the time, and Charlie just had to take it.   Nicole is a selfish bitch, fuck her. And fuck Laura Dern. She ruined star wars, she played the same self centered boney rich bitch in big little lies, she is a one trick pony and is probably the same in real life so it's easy to play yourself.   Her speech about women and jesus mother is nothing to feel sorry for as it is her sword, not her shield, after all that's what she leveraged to win the court case.   Aside from the fact that God was invoked as an absentee dad, the legal system fucks over men so royally that incentivises a man to get so angry and fed up that he abandons everything and cuts his losses, often heavy handedly and at the ultimate burden of the kids, who then grow up to be delinquents, addicts or criminal,  cuz of bitches like Laura Dern, and that Texas mother that brainwashed her son to thinking he's a girl.

fa8xrc2,"I couldn't agree more. Everyone does a fantastic job here particularly Driver, ScarJo and Laura Dern. While I've never been divorced I was a young teen for my parents and involved heavily in the ugly reality of my sister's and helping there.

This is one that I feel I need to absorb and left me drained. Absolutely one of the best of 2019. I always knew Driver was good and recently watched The Report but he was given more to work with here imo.

The comedic beats were great too. The emotions were palpable, particularly when they are screaming in Charlie's apartment and the end.

The line ‚ÄúI will never stop loving him, even though it doesn‚Äôt make sense anymore‚Äù makes me think he‚Äôs realizing in that moment he never had any hope. So maybe he didn‚Äôt have to go through the hassle of moving. Or he‚Äôs embarrassed he thought it was almost a phase. ‚ÄúAfter her pilot she‚Äôll move back.‚Äù That despite his good intentions and genuinely wanting to do what‚Äôs best, he doesn‚Äôt know this woman as well as he thought or ‚Äî more importantly ‚Äî he doesn‚Äôt know himself since he thought he had her figured out.",e6l8bc

Both have a very different vibe to them.

feaavpi,"I recently cut three of my fingers pretty deep while cooking - my wife and son were in the kitchen.

f9zlvig,How on earth would someone not understand that lol,e6l8bc
fa1d5uq,I personally take it to mean they were not meant to be as a couple. Charlie's love for his son is deep enough for him to make the sacrifice.,e6l8bc
fa3w4yv,"Yeah but I think the gut punch is, if he had been willing to make a sacrifice like that earlier in life, hia marriage may have lasted.",e6l8bc
fa2gwcj,"So I can't speak for other people saying ""What's the point?"", and maybe they just missed that he truly did not want to make that move. But I think asking ""What's the point?"" is still absolutely part of the ending. Because the fact is in the end, he was willing to make this sacrifice to be with his son. So we're forced to ask how much better this all could have been if this had happened and they were still together. But of course, that's a totally impossible question. If Nicole had stayed longer and tried to fight for their marriage, we have no reason to think that Charlie would have been *willing* to make that great sacrifice until he was forced to by her moving (and essentially, the pressures of the legal system). 

So it's not that ""Oh, he could have just moved out there and everything would have been all right"", because the movie explores in great detail how that isn't possible. The movie is pretty explicit about how Charlie and Nicole just *couldn't* work as a couple, there was no coming back for them. And yet, when so much of their conflict stemmed from his inability to compromise and sacrifice his career for her desires... the fact that he ended up doing that any way, but not from the beauty of sacrifice in a marriage, but from the dehumanizing system we see play out, which taxes both of them greatly financially and emotionally... it's such a bittersweet ending. 

Basically, we see that deep down, *of course* Charlie was willing to sacrifice his career for the good of his family, we know all along how much of a loving father he is. And yet, we also know that there was probably no other way for this to happen. It's so tempting to think ""If only we could have started with that, everything would have been saved"". But the movie makes so painfully clear how they never could have found this resolution naturally, and I genuinely don't think their marriage could have been saved.

EDIT: And I think ""what's the point"" is also the essential question behind structuring so much of this movie as a *legal drama*. Because the way that whole process plays out is heartbreaking. It dehumanizes them, it weaponizes all these typical aspects of a relationship against one another, and it's what ultimately brings out the worst in each of them. And yet, they arrive at what's basically a null result. I mean, Charlie loses the fight to bring the son back to NYC, but from the very start it was clear that was a losing battle, he should have realized he didn't have a shot. Financially, they both are successful enough to be fine, and they basically call it a draw (in fact, the financial burden they feel is *caused* by the legal process, not solved by it). If Charlie had just recognized that he couldn't keep his son in NYC, they basically could have skipped the brutal legal battle, and just split the finances themselves.

Of course, that's a fantasy! The messy reality of it is that the legal process was almost certainly necessary, in some sense. Charlie couldn't give up on his belief that they were a ""New York Family"" without bringing it to court. As well intentioned as they might hope to be, matters were probably just too raw for them to handle it between themselves. So you get this awful, dehumanizing process, that essentially brings them to the exact point where any reasonable bystander could have said from the start is where they end up! 

So I think ""What's the point?"" is absolutely the question begged by the ending of the movie, on multiple fronts. But I think the movie is also clear that these issues were *not* avoidable. This awful process might not have gotten them anywhere, but it was also pretty unavoidable. Charlie ended up making the very same sacrifice that broke the marriage (when he refused), and the legal proceedings brought them exactly to the point where the audience knew they had to end up the whole time. And yet, that's just the nature of being a person. It's very hard to fault Nicole for ""escalating"" the legal proceedings, even if those proceedings were the biggest catalyst for personal and financial hardship of the movie. And it's hard to fault Charlie for being unwilling to give up his entire beloved career so that his wife could pursue an uncertain dream in TV, even if the final result was so pointless and tragic.

TLDR: You're absolutely supposed to ask ""What's the point?"", but the movie answers it! Divorce is a truly awful process that didn't even bring them anywhere new. And yet, it was almost certainly necessary. You *do* see them start to heal afterwards, and it's only once those awful matters are settled that they could actually continue to develop as people.",e6l8bc

f9u6lnd,">The look on Nicole's face as Charlie tells her that he took a residency at UCLA is going to stay with me a very long time.

For a film that is able to make you lose all faith in love, I am so glad the ending was included. It could have ended after the songs, and it would have been a coherent film about people colliding and breaking apart. But the last couple of scenes  (the moment you describe, the tying of the shoelaces, the reading of the letter...) are so, so powerful. It is a story about love after all. Love, even in the ending, is not about winning or losing. It is so easy, once you drift apart, to get lost in a narrative where you vilify the other. In a narrative of selfishness or hurt. But even then, a connection remains. And after the fighting, all the ugliness, they could see that again, feel that again.  
Not winning, not losing, love.",e6l8bc
fa2clar,"> The masterpiece of this movie is that you both feel awful for the characters and completely understand why they make every decision they make.

So I fully agree with Charlie and Nicole. Like, I truly did not enjoy The Squid and the Whale, and this is why I think of Marriage Story as such a miraculous leap for Baumbach. Both Charlie and Nicole are so deeply flawed, they do genuinely awful things, and yet the movie treats them with such tenderness, you can't help but completely understand their actions. We see more of Charlie's perspective, so some aspects of Nicole are slightly more mysterious, but on an *emotional* level, we buy into both characters completely. It's genuinely masterful.

But I don't agree that we're meant to feel awful, or even sympathize, with many of the other characters. Nora and Jay might be doing their jobs, but they're also pretty despicable. I mean, the final 55-45 jab makes that explicit, she *wasn't* just doing her job there, she explicitly says it was about winning for her, not just protecting Nicole. A huge part of this movie is how dehumanizing the legal system is. Nicole and Charlie watch almost helplessly as the process they started slips beyond their control, and the innocent parts of their relationship are weaponized in the court room. And throughout, we see the humanity of Charlie and Nicole, because we understand why they let this happen... but I *don't* think we're given any reason to personally forgive the work of the lawyers, besides simply accepting that this is what the system demands of them.

> Laura Dern's speech on the expectations of a mother is poignant and powerful, everything about the way her character was written and performed personified that same message. 

I fully agree, it's an excellent speech, but I think the ending with the 55-45 split is meant to somewhat undermine it. I mean, it doesn't undermine the validity of the speech, but it reminds us that Nora was being quite disengenuous with her *own* motivations there (not that we're supposed to think Jay is any different!). I.e., the fact that her speech is very valid doesn't mean we need to see the *character* as genuine. And I think the movie takes a pretty harsh view of the main pair of lawyers here.

In fact, I don't think the movie humanizes almost any of the side characters (except perhaps Nicole's mother). They aren't all bad people or anything, like the Evaluator isn't doing anything wrong... she's just barely portrayed as human. Even the kid... I mean you can't blame a little kid for his actions, so he's not at fault, but the movie is pretty extreme in portraying how aggravating a small child can be in the eyes of a parent undergoing a divorce (The Squid and the Whale took the perspective of an angry teenager, this explicitly takes the perspective of the hurting adult, who might well be very frustrated with their ungrateful kid at a time like this, as blameless as they are).

I just think it's worth noting because the side characters were the only part of the movie that didn't quite hold up for me. Cassie and the Evaluator lead to some funny moments, but when the main characters were so deeply grounded and brutally realistic, this kinda absurdist slapstick comedy just didn't quite land for me. And I would have preferred they left the Nora character a bit more ambiguous, like Jay, just a faceless lawyer who did their job (instead of the 55-45 scene, which really confirms our suspicions about Nora). And the kid is portrayed as just *so* aggravating I think it was overdone. But these quibbles only stand out because the work the movie does with Charlie and Nicole was so mindblowingly good, right among the best relationship dramas I've ever seen put to film. I still was absolutely blown away by this movie, even if the side characters didn't really land (except for the mother, the only one Baumbach seemed to humanize, and her character worked fantastically well, both funny and heartbreaking).",e6l8bc

I found it interesting that the very first thing we hear from Charlie in that scene is the loud slam of a car door.  It made the women jump, including me.  How we engage with others isn't just the verbal pleasantries, but how we carry ourselves physically.

With Charlie loudly charging in the door and suddenly taking over the whole kitchen, you get a sense for how Nicole feels with him in the room.  Everyone else gets smaller and more insignificant.  All other things get put on hold, which is why you probably saw Nicole and her family trying to practice and stick to a script from the beginning.  She anticipated what would happen.  

But Nicole needed to find a better way to communicate.  It was pretty clear from her unwillingness to read her letter and her sudden breakdown as she leaves Charlie in the living room that night that she struggles to express vulnerability and still maintain her self-respect.

I think on here people are more putting fault with Adam Driver‚Äôs character but I wonder if it‚Äôs because they threw in two details. They are still technically married and she with holds sex for an entire year. The result, he seeks out sexual companionship. An odd choice to add in there, I wonder why it was part of the story. And then her going to bang the first stranger that pays attention to her that we see (which, she‚Äôs an actress who is attractive which a lot of guys and girls would pay attention to) but she says basically not going to bang the guy I feel like we‚Äôre suppose to root for her somehow in that moment because she says something along the lines of taking her power back? I guess I kind of felt disconnected with those two details because they both seemed so out of place. The entire movie, Adam Driver seems to be loving and affectionate with his family and their other baby that they built together the Theater Company. I guess towards the end she became more what she wanted to be? But it looked like she moved extremely quick into a relationship where the new guy has already taken the place of Henry‚Äôs father and going trick or treating which as someone who was in a relationship with someone with kids was a huge thing for me. I don‚Äôt know, I see a lot of posts on here placing most or sole blame on Charley but she seemed incapable of being happy and couldn‚Äôt communicate effectively to even try to repair something, turned on her family and life when she felt she wasn‚Äôt happy when she never asked herself what actually made her happy. If you paid attention to her story with her lawyer it was basically she wanted the glory and for Charley to take a backseat instead of a co-pilot or partner and she punished him for it. He basically did his best to survive in the process that was completely manipulated into knowingly or not for actually giving into requests of involving her family as his family at births, marriage and everything. Him interacting with her family it was clear it was ‚Äúhis‚Äù family too because his biological family were monsters. She never once really tried to understand what he was doing for her under the guise of her acting happy and probably saying she was happy and dropping hints that she wanted something new without saying something all the while to ambush him with divorce. He definitely didn‚Äôt neglect her and I don‚Äôt feel he was selfish but rather was completely in an unknown situation (take the car seat scene) rather than willingly neglecting his family or her.

Personally, those were the weakest part of the movie for me, but I know for others they delivered some of the best comedic moments, which I certainly respect (because the comedy is essential to this movie, and it's what makes it flow). But I definitely wouldn't call them 98% real, so they're relatable. In fact, I'm don't even think we're meant to necessarily relate to the lawyers. I mean we can imagine in the abstract they're just doing their job, but we don't see much of their human side. Well, we don't for Jay, and for Nora, her speech about being a mother is quite humanizing, but that's somewhat undermined by her final jab with the 55-45 split, just to notch the win. 

But I think that's quite intentional. The human characters here are Charlie and Nicole. The rest are basically very carefully designed props, our sympathies never get distracted by these side characters. And while I didn't love the execution of all of them, that premise is fine. The emotions of this story are *exclusively* that of Charlie and Nicole. We don't need to understand the human emotions of 
 the Evaluator or Cassie, they're just tools to propel the story we care about.",e6l8bc

fb3grim,"> I wonder how accurate Marriage Story is when it comes to LA divorce lawyer fees. Ray Liota the big shot lawyer charged $950 an hour, and his assistant charged $400 an hour (""If you have a stupid question, email Ted!""). In order to hire the big shot, Adam Driver had to pay for a $25,0000 retainer.

I'm a lawyer. This would be accurate for LA, 100%. 

It's insane. I'm glad that I work in the corporate context and pretty much only charge corporate entities, because they (and rich people, or the super-insured) are really the only ""people"" who can afford lawyers without it ruining their lives/business. Whenever I represent people or very small businesses, I no charge a lot of time.

Frankly I'm always amazed when any sort of litigation costs less than $20,000, and the attorney at my firm charge nowhere near $900/hour. It adds up very quickly.

The only thing that stunned me was that Adam Driver didn't go crazy. He was flying around everywhere, kid was so hard to deal with, ex hard to deal with / hard to read, the attorneys' fees, the attorneys being fake nice, etc. I'm genuinely surprised he didn't do something crazy.",e6l8bc

Nicole let herself lose her sense of identity and self in his suave and artistic self because she found it really easy to go along for the ride and let him get away with all his egotisical selfishness of always getting what he wanted and directing everything for himself. So she eventually she gets fed up and takes it out on him instead of standing up for her sense of self. She isn't strong enough to stand up as her own individual, make her own choices, and live out her own life and work that healthy mindset in the context of their marriage so that Charlie can work with it. However, Charlie is too much of an asshole to deal with that but at the same time Nicole is too much of a pushover until she explodes and can't take it anymore to actually negotiate a fair system so that both parties get what they want in a manner that develops a successful marriage.

Nicole was the centre/glue, Charlie was ""in charge"", and that wasn't sustainable long term for them (nor should it be).

I don't think Charlie was a misogynist or harbored those kind of conscious beliefs, and I think they sidestepped that landmine by making Charlie a work driven director as far a what drove his expectations: He didn't expect Nicole to be ""the wife"" because she was a woman, he expected it because he was an inspired and passionate director who had little time for anything else (except Henry).

Great movie. This point in time is seeing a shift in people's expectations on what a marriage and partnership is and this movie shows a relationship having broken down due to those expectations being unmet, despite clear love and admiration they both have for each other as both people and professionals in their field. They did not have the tools, emotionally, to get out ahead of their issues and solve them and both were wrapped up in the current of their lives to realize they were heading for the rocks.",e6l8bc

Also I do not get the sex part. Okay, she did not give to him for a year. He could have communicated. They lacked communication. But i am not saying what he did was right. I hace more to say here but not getting there.

I think you confound Charlie‚Äôs belief. He didn‚Äôt disrespect her. That‚Äôs how she felt. She matters also which is why they got a divorce. Charlie was shit on. She has a plan and when she got that lawyer she got a better plan.  She was right to feel as strongly as she did but she was wrong.  She sent the attack dog of the attorney. 

That‚Äôs the point of the entire movie. They both weren‚Äôt at fault. I believe she was the biggest asshole but that‚Äôs her prerogative.  The movie was about how others get involved to make shit worse. With the incompetent government over and over again showing no one fucking cares. 

The divorce was inevitable. Charlie was told that by Alan Alda. It was about how hard do you make it on the other person?  Or yourself for that matter. ‚ÄúThis is only temporary‚Äù. It was going to happen. He couldn‚Äôt stop it, but greedy fucks tried.",e6l8bc

She hires a lawyer just because her strong and independent producer says she should, even though she says that she don't want to. Then she meets Nora, who is strong and independent, and Nicole is immediately spun by her storytelling. When Nora goes against her clients will and gets her 55/45 just in spite, Nicole does not muster the agency to claim her will properly, even though it is *her* divorce.

Well u see, as the title says this is a marriage story, not all marriages are like this thankfully :) but some are similar and others are better or a bit worse, it varies really. I personally think this movie is great bcs it gives u a realistic perspective of what a marriage COULD be like, so u could go in prepared on what not to do as a partner when u r dating somebody or watch out for as in >red flags<. 

As u could see in the movie... communication was terrible bcs u know... he would ignore her needs, she kinda lost herself in him, he wasnt ready for commitment but he did it anyway then he cheated and she got frustrated and then they stopped being intimate and they got farther apart and on and on... and later on they give u a glimpse on how divorces can be chaotic and most importantly... lawyers and how horrible court systems are....

We never really know how lawyers in divorces really work until we need one and with this movie, they tried to make it as realistic as possible showing how they can hurt the relationship between both parties. Planting ideas in their heads or telling us about state laws and stuff... its crazy.

Initially Charlie and Nicole had a somewhat agreeable divorce discussion w no lawyers and everything split equally and no lies no tricks and a good relationship (which could the case with couples actually) and then we saw how when lawyers come in, the state laws come too and the huge amounts of money and the disputes and the fights and the court and the big and messy divorce we all have heard about finally takes place... 

And after the huge mess we see the break through of nicole still caring about her son's dad's well-being... which is the scene of her tying his shoelaces... 
I think this movie is only A marriage story and is not representative at all of what a marriage SHOULD be like ofc... BUT it is still a marriage story that ended up in divorce that teaches us how complicated love is... and how it is important to take care of our mental health and our traumas and communicate and listen to our partner.",e6l8bc

-Scarjo left her family and a promising career in acting to follow him around. She even lent her name to start his theater company

But they damn sure spend a year in Copenhagen at his behest. At this point she has given up her life, career, former friends, to raise their child.

-When she does take a role that interests her, he actively belittles it until he finds out how much money it pays and asks her to put that money into his theatre company. 

-He the has the audacity to fuck a women he works with.

That fight scene solidified him as a forever asshole.

-he reveals that never considered her or what she wanted. He really doesn't even have a clue of all these issues behind her decision to divorce. His utter cluelessness and lack of willingness to listen and take her opinions into account, leaves her no option but to leave him and create her own life

-He reveals his resentment to her for ""wasting his 20's"" i.e. not being able to fuck other girls. He actively wants to applauded for not fucking other women in this time period, in which she was also monogamous. Being a famous actress, I'm sure she had men lining up for a chance with her. But no, it's him that deserves praise.

-He fucked another woman and has zero remorse. In fact, he manages to use it to victimize himself, that he didn't fuck more women!

fepuhey,"The movie was definitely confusing for me in terms of expectations. I had expected that both sides would have legitimate gripes to raise with each other, just for the purposes of having a more balanced narrative. Instead, Charlie seems to be treated as far more flawed.

On one hand, he is flawed, no denying that. He can be quite self-absorbed and insensitive about the desires of people around him. The whole comparison of ""staying in Copenhagen for a play"" vs ""turning down an opportunity in LA"" highlights how he prioritizes desires. He has a certain insistence and stubbornness that he doesn't always explain in the best way.

So the film never really gets a good chance to properly explain his perspective. Whereas Nicole gets several scenes to show how hurt she is and explaining her situation to Nora.

If ScarJo had cheated there'd be no movie because most men don't forgive that, but expect  their own affairs to be seen as meaningless.

He lied about it too, so his cheating is an unforgivable Rubikon moment for anyone who's personality is pride based. The ScarJo emotional types just are not mean enough to have those clear uncrossable lines about anything. To them everything is 'human' and case by case.

I thought ScarJo was correct to divorce because of the cheating, despite the emotional mess responsibility being equal.

If there was no cheating, her power move instead should have been to take the kid to LA in an ultimatum seperation until Charlie could get his head on straight about her life mattering just as much as his.

I don't understand how this is relevant to the argument. Are you implying that because you are a gay male you sympathize more with females?


> one of the issues pointed out in this very film with our society, the rooted, sublte mysogeny and blaming women for wanting and desiring

Sorry but this is not about some equality problem. At the end of the day men always lose in court because they are male because they have to be perfect and even if they are they will never be held in the same way as females. That argument is totally bs... 

All a woman has to say to the judge is that the dad was aggressive and the court most likely than not will side with the mother because ""men are aggressive"" so it must be true. You have no idea how many guys have been kicked out of their children's life because of a separation. 

This woman who has her own valid reasons to split decided unilaterally break a promise to her long-lasting partner, sending her kid to Cali alongside with her, getting a fucking lawyer even though they were going to discuss things by themself.

Yes, he is not perfect but how did he deserve to be sidelined and predated by her and her lawyer? Going to all the lawyers so he couldn't get representation? really??? 

The guy did the same as her and when he saw that things were in a way that could hurt her and her reputation he backed off only to be betrayed by him.

edit: Sorry for the tone. I just feel so frustrated because I'm a guy that has always dreamed about having a family a boy and its terrifying to think that the mother of my child could have so much power over me and my kid.

fn23fuk,"Well, we see them as confused, flawed characters in the beginning, but then there is a sharp turn in the second act, and all of a sudden all Nicole's narration stops, her point of view is not considered, and all her evolution - how she became evil - is skipped. So it's hard to see her as anything but evil, because that's what the film makes her to be: we did not see her coarsen up or even fall under bad influence; we see her one day as a deuteragonist, and then the next time we see her she lies, she does all  she can to fuck the guy over, she is full on marriage Darth Vader. So to say the film is feminist or critical of misogyny IMO is laughable, since the film is every sexist cliche.

fctbxra,"I didn't feel like Nicole was turning Henry against Charlie on purpose. Or at least I think this was left more ambiguous in the film. The lawyers that Charlie went to initially implied that Nicole did it on purpose, but it was also ambiguous as to whether or not Nicole was aware of the implications of serving in California.

What was clear was that Henry didn't understand the sacrifices his father was making to come see him because he's just a kid who doesn't understand that his dad is too exhausted to play with him and that he was enjoying himself more in LA compared to when he was in NYC. It was also alluded to several times that Charlie had issues with his own parents, which explained why he had trouble connecting with his son and was perhaps more harsh on him than Nicole (e.g. homework, bathroom award).

The lawyering up aspect wasn't a ""good"" idea, but I think it was a human reaction and I don't think the film is about who's more ""right"" or ""wrong"" in the sense that I think the film was trying to bring attention to how we have a greater tendency to make misjudgments in moments of weakness, for better or for worse. In the film, Nicole talks a lot about how she felt as though she lacked control over her own life and I think lawyering up was one way in which she felt like she could wrest some of that control back, esp. since it was Charlie's idea in the first place. In their argument, Charlie described how he felt like life with Nicole was ""joyless"" because he could tell she was becoming incredibly unhappy with him and so he cheated on her and in his own way regained some semblance of control back in his own life (and he never told Nicole, although she did find out).

It's clich√©, but ""All's fair in love and war"" is really the perfect way to describe the overall theme of the film, because it's not really about one side ""winning"" or ""losing"" because both sides incur immense personal losses.

But I think the film also ends on a hopeful note. Although two people can no longer be in each other's lives anymore, it's better to have loved than to have never loved at all. And that love perseveres in some way, even if it doesn't manifest itself as staying married with the person that you love.",e6l8bc

Nicole is a people pleaser who went along with Charlie's career.  She could have had a big movie career and sidelined it for love.  Over time, she becomes bitter over that.  But the real end of the marriage is Charlie's affair.  I am endlessly amazed how the comments here skip over the affair because I think that's the root of the contentious divorce.

Charlie is a relatively selfish person.  The extended family is in LA.  Nicole has more work options in LA.  Yet Charlie turns down a year in LA because he prefers Broadway.  

Yes, Nicole could have pushed more for what she wanted, but Charlie knew she was close to her family and had more work options in LA.  Part of being with someone is acknowledging their needs even when they don't force you to.

And.... Charlie cheated on Nicole with the stage manager of their theater group.  Someone Nicole saw everyday!  That is incredibly disrespectful.",e6l8bc
faj344o,"i would agree. the first act of the film felt like an even split of telling both sides of the story, and then i would say the 2nd to beginning of the 3rd act felt like it was all about charlie's side. i don't know. i felt like there were moments later on where they should've gone back and spent more time with nicole  and they didn't (like after she found out he cheated - they went back to her....making out with the grip....and then back to charlie irrc).

i thought scarlett did a really good job, but driver's honestly overshadowed her. like in the fight scene, i know everyone's commenting on how good the acting was, which is true...but i felt like scarlett never quite reached the place \[emotionally\] that driver did...she just came in a little short.",e6l8bc
fb88hzt,"Sorry, late to the thread.

I think that's the only way the movie could work tbh. There has to be that balance. She *was* callous, and maybe she barely even expressed her desires to Charlie at all. That's her biggest fault. Charlie cheated on her late into their marriage and that was his biggest fault. It's 1-1. If she had voiced her desires and Charlie truly brushed them off as overtly as she claimed (in addition to cheating on her), then it's she's up 2-0. See what I mean?",e6l8bc

Nora did give mostly what Nicole and Charlie wanted, but couldn't let go of her personal vendettas and pulled that last second custody bs. Not exactly a bad guy, not exactly a good guy. The first lawyer, he wasn't the best representative for Charlie especially with the scares of custody over Henry, the first lawyer was an already defeated man who, however, was right from the start and was trying to give the best option for Charlie. But Charlie being so stuck on NY, the lawyer did say its up to the kid and what he wants, and warned Charlie that fighting for what Charlie wants- would end up with Henry being upset. Ray Liotta- just doing his job in the best interest of Charlie. Aware of how nasty things can get and was trying to attack every angle at Nicole before Nora could get to Charlie. All are grey. None are good but none are bad.",e6l8bc

But again, Nora also was just someone who dealt with her pain in an unhealthy with a personal vendetta against husbands and to ultimately serve what she thought was justice for Nicole but really it was ""justice"" for her. Nicole didn't want to end things so nasty or painfully. Both parents were aware that they didnt want to put Henry through that, but were so stubbornly set in their ways- especially Charlie. He assumed what was best for Nicole, and best for Henry. Not realizing, Henry is happier in LA. Henry didnt have actual friends in New York, and he didnt like math. Charlie overtime basically realized, he's not as close to his son as he thought he was. He realized, he's been just selfish. Though again, both weren't perfect. Through the material aspect, Charlie's been right. He's been providing in his pursuits. But in the emotional and personal aspects, Nicole's been right. Charlie made it. He got his achievement. When is it Nicole's turn? He could've tried with LA when an opportunity was offered but chose his contentment and comfort over hers.",e6l8bc

They finally were able to be flexible. Nicole gave Charlie Henry for the night even though he insisted it was her night. A stark contrast to earlier when he said ""but it's my night"". They dont intend to live by the 55/45 that was clearly defined by the divorce decree. At least Nicole isn't, and maybe Charlie too will soon realize and be flexible too. He has already taken a huge step by taking residencey at UCLA. He's the most New York or New Yorkers. So he too is willing to set aside his ego and desires for Henry and ultimately what his family is now. Neither of them care about winning.

The cheating was Charlie‚Äôs culmination in his lack of recognition for Nicole‚Äôs own ambitions, the movie had to broaden out to explain why he ended up cheating on her and it‚Äôs because he did not, or would not, recognize her LA ambitions as legitimate. He would say that he knew what makes her truly happy and that‚Äôs how it should always be because everything else is a distraction to him.

I'm sure plenty of families do this and are able to use their judgement over what tasks they can trust their kids with, but conventional wisdom is relatively straightforward - kids probably shouldn't be using knives. But Charlie has presumably had this trust with his son for years, to the point where it doesn't even occur to him until he's saying it that he shouldn't be explaining what the ""knife thing"" is so glibly.

It looked like a murder scene, he‚Äôs dripping blood, his hand is bloody grabbing her purse and they both just want that moment to end.

Man literally bled for his son despite knowing beforehand that he was fighting a war in which he was losing (remember in the big argument earlier he mentioned this) and by then he already knew he had lost. So many times he had performed the seemingly harmless knife trick back when the marriage was relatively ""blissful"" but only now, when the marriage had broken, only now it was a trick no longer. It had to fail (or succeed) only once and it happened right there and then, during his last-ditch efforts to assuage the unmoved evaluator of her uncertainties. It is as if the years of ""rehearsals"" culminated in that important, crucial moment, the ""big stage"" if you will. And oh, isn't it oddly poetic that the knife was a gift from no other than his wife? In the play, *Electra*, which was mentioned in the film, didn't King Agamemnon return home from a war with a new concubine and was promptly murdered by his wife? At least, that is just one similarity with what happened between Charlie and Nicole, give or take.

I think after the social worker heard Henry talk about the funny ""game"" his parents play and then she sees what the game is-- Charlie pretending to cut his mom with a knife! That is a BIG red flag. No doubt the social worker hears that he passed out from blood loss on the kitchen floor, another BIG red flag for giving him custody.",e6l8bc

-He the has the audacity to fuck a women he works with.

Therefore, leading to the approach she chose, and Mary Ann was likely sending a ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt want him, I‚Äôll take him‚Äù type of message imo.

2.) I think in that moment Mary Ann was kind of burying his feelings on it, and trying to alienate Charlie over it, the way the affair did her. Kind of blowing him off and showing she‚Äôs over him at the same time. An awkward assertion of social dominance. 

Just my thoughts",e6l8bc

She acted incredibly uncomfortable around Charlie, and seemed to instantly take Nicoles side on any issue Charlie brought up. The fact that we never see Nicole's observation seems to support this. We see Charlie being scrutinised whilst we don't see that for Nicole.

As Charlie says, he feels like a criminal, and the social worker treats him as one. This is accompanied by imagery of violence: knives and blood and a fist shaped hole in the wall. Not only with Charlie's pocket knife, but also him brandishing the kitchen knife whilst talking to her. It felt as though the social worker was scared she could be attacked at any moment, even though we as the viewer know Charlie isn't like that. She's constantly keeping her distance from him, leading to the uncomfortable moment where he has to enter her personal space to open the door for her.

The reason it seems so weird in Marriage Story is because  Nicole is on a television series and seems like she could afford this herself.

Remember she was married to a talented director, and acted herself. She has tons of experience but just never got to put it to use. The film actively seeks to portray this: the scene of her holding the baby and making meaningful suggestions that saved the actual director from dismantling the essence of the character, the reference in a conversation about how she loved when he (A genius director) took her suggestions/viewpoints and actually applied them. She was more than capable. That is why Charlie, though he's highly competitive, is genuinely happy and proud of her. I loved that character growth imo. Given that she has a new man by that point its not a stretch to say she's had time to come into her skills. It is surprising to do that well so early, but it was deliberate.

It made me see my partner's infidelity in a new light. I really think that's a testament to strength of Baumbach's writing and just how layered these performances were.

He put on somewhat of a show in the conference room with Nicole's attorney, but ultimately all his conversations with Charlie are to prepare Charlie for capitulation to prevent the divorce from being drawn out and contentious (which his atty values mostly because after three divorces, he's probably turned off from the prospect of a long drawn out process).

The guy he had the first consultation with was at least willing to come up with ways of allowing Charlie to keep his money and maybe keep his family in New York, and was willing to get in the mud with Nicole's lawyer if need be.",e6l8bc

Her life was kinda steered by the first BF, then Charlie, then Charlie her son and marriage, the her divorce lawyer. Even on the set of her movie she's letting other people tell her what to do. 

I think she really needs to develop her voice and sense of self because its hard to see. I know its not fair to expect the world from your partner but I wish they had talked more about the cause of the divorce. I wish Charlie knew that he needed to support her and stuff. I also think that people dont realize that where Charlie is even keel as his natural disposition, Nicole is emotional and reactive and throughout the movie rightfully upset.

fb6hau7,">I am very surprised by the reception this film is getting. Don't get me wrong, the acting was very good, and the movie did a great job following what an actual divorce process would look like. The problem is, that divorce litigation is pretty dry, and despite the emotion shown by the characters, the plot was not meaningful at all. Most inexplicably to me was when the writers set up a great moment and then let it go: Nicole could have honored the 50/50 split to show what we all saw, that she still cared for Charlie on some level. But all she did was hesitate and take the 55/45.

At the beginning Jennifer knew they couldn't be together. But she still shared a love for him that would never go away. For Charlie it took him the whole movie to understand they couldn't be together in the same way ever again.

The story was procedural in the sense that it was basically the start to end to a whole divorce with all the nasty and uncomfortable stuff in between. Their was nothing driving the plot forward other then the divorce itself and all the range of emotions that come with it.

This was not a movie that would of done too well in a theater for that exact reason. It is a movie made to make you feel vs be watched and enjoyed. 

However it's not one of those watch once cause it was emotionally draining of a movie like say Reqium Dream. Because it does hold on to those small details of joy and love that make all of this worthwhile. Sorry it didn't completely connect with you. I thought it was great.",e6l8bc

School in LA, served in LA etc and he refuses to see it because it's a truth that doesn't suit him. He just expects to get his way.

&#x200B;

Imagine being married to that. I felt Nicole definitely tried to communicate with him and hit the same brick wall. Then he had an affair.

fakigfq,"He cheated on her.   It really weirds me out how many of the comments here that sympathize with Adam skip over that fact.  Scarlett pretty specifically says that the reason she's chosen a lawyer (over mediation) is the affair.  

The movie makes it clear over and over again, that Scarlett always preferred LA to NY but Adam steamrolled her and Scarlett didn't push back.  They could both work in LA, the only extended family they had was in LA, but Adam was so focused on what he wanted that he pushed for NY and hired a more combative lawyer.  Adam doesn't listen to anyone.

Scarlett is a people pleaser.  Adam's letter showed that, so did their relative ease at sharing custody.  She could have been more upfront about wanting to be in LA and the fact that she felt steamrolled in general.  But the affair was what really ended the marriage and I don't think Adam could have won her back.  That look at the end was her surprise that he actually compromised.",e6l8bc
farxrhg,"I didn't see it so much as Nicole's getting a lawyer as going above and beyond to screw Charlie over so much as another example of one of her defining character flaws - she's too passive and not always sure how to assert what she wants on the rare occasions that she even knows what that is. When Charlie was the most domineering personality in her life, she was more inclined to go along with him and not have any lawyers involved. Once she was away from him, she was steered in another direction by a different domineering personality. 
Regardless, however they ended up going about it the core conflict wasn't going to change. Nicole wanted to raise their son in LA and Charlie wanted him in NY. Neither one's personal preference was really more valid than the other's. Charlie's 'created' family that he built around his theater is no more or less important than Nicole's blood family. Whatever her motivations were, it's pretty clear that retaining Nora did put Nicole in the best position to get what she wanted where Charlie wouldn't have been willing to compromise. Hard to fault her for that.",e6l8bc
faj87xq,I thought the whole point was that she kept the letter and the kid found them,e6l8bc

His lawyer then tells him not to worry cause the kid has time to learn about what kind of person his father is.

fapc6an,">It was said that she basically woke up one day unhappy because she was unable to pursue her goals

That's not at all what the movie said.  The movie made it clear that she had brought up moving to LA over and over again.  She spent summers there with Charlie.  Charlie only saw Nicole's career as a way to fund his theater company.

>She is the one who filed, he seems grounded throughout the film 

Well, he's the one who cheated (with their mutual coworker).  It is a lot easier for him to be sanguine about the whole thing.

>I understand that Nicole's goals are important, but its not more important than your family. Charlie's lawyer said he wanted his family in New York for ""family stability"" and this is the right decision. Family> your dreams

The only extended family they had was in LA.  They were both able to work in LA.  That Nicole gives Charlie when he announces his UCLA job is very much ""If you'd been willing to do this three years ago...""

>The poor bastard was being railroaded by the system and his wife was using the kid as a pawn. 

That is not at all the message of the movie.

To me, Nicole was being very vindictive and also completely untrustworthy, reneging from every verbal agreement she ever made with Charlie. About moving back to New York, about not using lawyers, hell even about reading the note aloud at the marriage counselor's office!

I did relate to a few things, I think for a lot of married women and mothers you feel like you have sacrificed your own identity, however I choose my life now and there might be a few what ifs and wishes, but I did find it relatable. Also my husband and I have different sex drives and I‚Äôve never seen that issue brought up in a movie so that felt real to me. I liked it overall but I did get a little bored and I‚Äôm glad they move on with life and that there wasn‚Äôt a suicide or anything, or some huge tragedy.

The film unfolded very well in that regard.

Also I was impressed with Driver because I have kindof low expectations of his acting having only seen him in Star Wars I guess?

She is living in her Mom's house and playing some weird CGI character, when Charlie wins a huge grant for the play that she starred in. Then we learn that he cheated on her while they were married. 

So its set up that you sympathize with Nicole from the start.

But then you see how hard everything is on Charlie, how he's a great father and still cares for Nicole. You see him turn down the woman he had an affair with, while she hooks up with a random guy. How her lawyer is an asshole and his is a nice grandpa. Then in the end she finds success in her career, has a new boyfriend and a large house. Compared to his small apartment and failed Broadway play. 

At first you sympathize with Nicole, then you sympathize with Charlie. But at the very end she lets charlie take their son home on ""her night"" and ties his shoe for him.

The turnaround was too quick there, that's not how humans operate.

I'd argue that's exactly how humans operate. You say horrible shit to each other in the heat of the moment you don't mean. You break down instantly when you realize you don't mean it.

It's possible to love someone and still know they aren't right for you because you've meshed yourself into them and lost yourself, which is what she is going through. And it is possible to love someone and not realize you have neglected them to the point that you've abused their trust and kindness, which is what he is going through. If only they had communicated what they had written in their letters earlier, then they could have worked that our, but instead they built up years of resentment.   


In the aftermath of the breakup, it's just people being people, responding to the context as it unfolds around them, yet still guided by their true and complete love for the other, which is what we see unfold, tragically, as both people start to see what they've lost both in the marriage and in themselves.

Turning down the residency is mentioned with the lawyers without any objection, which supports Nicole's version.  Meanwhile, the family moved to Copenhagen for Charlie's career.

>Nicole kept adding drama for no reason. 

Charlie had an affair with the stage manager.  So not only was he unfaithful, he was unfaithful with someone Nicole saw everyday.  That's the betrayal that pushes her to fight.

Ultimately, Henry's life is better in LA than it was in NY, which justifies the ""drama"". 

As u/Breakingwho as said they're both being very selfish; the amount of screentime Henry receives (or lack thereof) exemplifies that. It just so happens that Charlie is clinging more to the life he wants to life (in his NY apartment, with his NY-based theater company) without willing to compromise for Henry (again u/Breakingwho notes that Henry literally says he prefers LA and Henry is able to verbalize that in more ways, such as when he says he prefers his school his in LA, his friends in LA, his family in LA, etc.). While Nicole is self-serving to to move home to LA for her family and career, she isn't pushing Henry to do things he doesn't want to do. I can't recall a single scene where Nicole has to ask or even beg Henry to do things, whereas Charlie is consistently asking Charlie to come to his apartment, or go trick-or-treating with him. While Nicole is being selfish, it is implied through Henry's behavior that she is being compromising in her selfishness where it best suits Henry and his needs. Henry's growth in reading ability demonstrated near the end of the movie shows how positive living in LA with Nicole has been for Henry; contrast that with all the scenes where Charlie is trying to no avail to get Charlie to read or sound out words earlier in the movie.

The line Nicole says about her son growing up is just a process of ""moving away"" to me was a metaphor for humans in general, we all have free will and want our own things and you can love someone to death and still have to let them go to do their own thing.

That being said, Charlie definitely made subtle remarks that hinted at his selfishness and need for control. Examples; commenting how he likes her hair longer, making harsh judgements on her parenting for things that didn't matter (sock pants, halloween), and ultimately refusing to see why she wouldn't want to come back to NY after the divorce.. he keeps the social life and theater, what is there for her?

Nicole was constantly crying out to say how he was controlling and she had no voice, however we didn't see Nicole's struggle in the relationship, we only see the aftermath and Charlie catching up to the pain she had already gone through, as a result I think it was natural for some viewers to empathize more with his character.",e6l8bc
fa11faj,"We see Nicole's reasons and then a lot of Charlie dealing with it. I would say it is actually a bit unbalanced in favour of Charlie's perspective. Also, Nicole didn't want to move abroad (she wanted LA) and that was repeated a lot and was crucial, so I hope you did pay attention.",e6l8bc
fa17x4z,"They literally brought up all of those points and said why they happened from his point of view. 

Nicole barely slept with him for like a year and the temptation grew too much because like he said he was hot shit in NY. He denied Nicole the move to LA because he knew the theatre company would suffer (which it evidently did during the divorce with the play being pulled from broadway because he wasn't there to oversee it).",e6l8bc
fnn41dj,"I get where your coming from. At the surface it does seem like Nicole is ignorant to Charlie's feelings, however, it is important to dive below the surface and acknowledge her perspective also. She feels as though she has neglected her own wishes and desires and struggled to articulate this to Charlie. It is not necessarily her fault- she never meant to inflict blame and disappointment upon Charlie, but the line of communication was never clear and she did the best she could. Before concluding that Nicole was the sole antagonist, note that we see the film from the perspective of Charlie and that there are always two sides to a story.",e6l8bc

You can disagree with it, but I don't see why you feel that that left a bad taste in your mouth, but not the fact that Nicole took their kid across the country, wouldn't participate in counseling, got lawyers involved after saying that they wouldn't, ended his career in New York AND got everything she wanted at the end of movie. They could've separated amicably, but she decided not to. Imo, cheating does not mean you have to fuck someone's whole life up",e6l8bc
fctkjqm,"I thought it was a very real moment though. 

I'm about the age of the protagonists and I got married in my early twenties. If I put myself in his shoes exactly I would feel like I wasted my prime years on something I thought was for life. And then to be single again in your thirties... You're playing the field again but all your best years you sat on the bench. 

And I might catch some flack, but if your spouse isn't sleeping with you for a year that really is just as much a relationship ""crime"" as cheating to me and it makes cheating more reactionary. 

Sex is part of most healthy romantic relationships and if you find yourself being neglectful to such an extent, talk about it. Find the cause of it and correct it. Otherwise yeah... Your sexually neglected spouse is going to eventually explore other avenues.",e6l8bc
fdd199l,"I actually was thinking that Noah was pretty brave putting this story out there. Charlie is not a saint.  Even that revelation is not flattering. It makes him look juvenile, but it does seem honest. 

You do sympathize with Charlie in the aftermath where he wants to be close with the kid. However, Charlie bears at least half, arguably more, of the responsibility for the marriage ending. There's a whole monologue devoted to where he went wrong. 

At least in the movie, the cheating is almost an afterthought and symptom of a deeper issue. Nicole seemed to be most devastated about Charlie not listening/minimizing her role in the relationship.",e6l8bc
fd363kz,"The cheating aspect was pretty objective, I thought. I don't think Baumbach wanted you to sympathize with him there.

I decided to watch it based on the hype and an interview I read with Scarlett Johansson. I wish I hadn't read anything prior, because I'd expected her to be great! I loved Adam Driver, Meritt Wever and Laura Dern's acting, but ScarJo's performance felt flat, even with tears in her eyes. It did not move me. I loved the lawyers scenes too. Laura Dern stole the show!

Joaquin Phoenix and Joker are much more deserving of an Oscar, IMHO. I saw it 4 times at the theater and cried each time!

The scene didn‚Äôt feel natural ‚Äî it felt like an acting class.  I found myself thinking about how the cast and crew were all going to clap on the set and have a beer after doing that scene a bunch of times.  So much of the movie felt real and subtle, and the acting was great.  But the over the top tone of this scene seemed out of place and distracting.  

Meanwhile, Laura Dern‚Äôs scene about mother‚Äôs vs. fathers, Virgin Mary etc. was also over the top but that hit the mark perfectly imho.  Hey Laura Dern‚Äîrocks!

f9tqs3y,"I think that scene was to set up how she was never heard by Charlie. She expressed her wishes to not hear Charlie's letter, the mediator kept pushing, Charlie agreed with mediator and Nicole was feeling as if her feelings didn't matter. Hence her ""suck each others dicks"" comment. 

She felt like they were having a brofest while she was wanting to establish a boundary. She was TIRED of hearing what Charlie wanted. This is what led the to divorce - his inability to acknowledge her needs.",e6l8bc

Good job liberals.",e6l8bc
f9trd5w,"this is such an interesting take. I've loved every Baumbach I've seen (Marriage Story is a 10 for me) but also, his Gerwig work have always had something special and I just thought it's because she was saying the lines... Frances and Mistress are two of the most compassionate films I've come across",e6l8bc

fa7dyw0,"I sort of went into it starting to feel the way you describe. I think the fact that the movie starts out giving both perspectives, nearly, but ends with us only hearing hers, is meant to make us take a side, which is hers(ish). She was genuinely feeling like she gave up for 10? years, her family and her potential and whatnot. Acting gigs, Los Angeles / family, etc. The kid himself expresses enjoying Los Angeles to Driver. Driver, to some degree, sees her as an extension. They seemed to only imply it, but I had the feeling that though things were wrong, he didn't make a point to ask her what she was feeling and instead just cheated on her (nevermind that apparently she never stepped out, despite definitely having the opportunities-- maybe not the same ones, but certainly opportunities. Yet Driver talks about all he missed out on with her).

Realistically, she probably had it in her to resolve the divorce better, but lacked the actual resolve to execute things to get what she wanted. In person, she and Charlie were always sort of acting parts, ish.

At the same time, I think we're meant to like Charlie as a person-- but also realize how much he's wrong, and how much a relationship can fall apart where it really, really matters. He does try to give her credit in some ways, but at the same time seems to have only his vision in mind. I think he credits her in the way that she conforms to his vision, without appreciating fully what she gave up to be an actress in the life he was directing.

In a way, I think it's sort of gustier to make us take a side. I think it's easy to say people are messy and everyone is a little wrong. I think it's hard to make us like someone but also tell us this person we might be friends with is kind of an ass.

Regardless, they do love each other (Nicole more than him) and have something. But the relationship needed to end, and the sacrifice she made in her career gets ""rebalanced"" by the sacrifice he makes to be near his son. (Although truthfully-- realistically-- Nicole should have faced that her wants were different before having a child. But, it's a moot point as the movie happens.)",e6l8bc
fa8hun3,The note is something you'd let your kid read to balance the arrival of the new boyfriend; send a clear message to the kid that dad is great and here to stay and that there's no bad blood (or give the illusion that everything is fine). In divorces with a kid the best advice is to not trash talk the other parent as it alienates everything so the note is effective in sending that message in the film.,e6l8bc
fa9i0ir,"I think the movie was criticizing the divorce process more than Scarlet. She didn‚Äôt want it but was swept up in that shitty Laura Dern presentation.  Where she kicked off her heels and started rubbing her shoulders creepily but it worked. It was a statement the movie made several times that ‚Äúthey could solve their problems on their own‚Äù. 

Alan Alda in the first negotiation told Driver best. He told Driver exactly where he would be at the end of the movie no matter what and it was in his best interest to save money. Driver didn‚Äôt choose that route. He went for Ray Liota to make her pay. And in the end they ended up where they were 

That was the point of the social worker who clearly didn‚Äôt give a fuck about what was going on. She‚Äôs seen worse. Adam cut himself and nothing came of it. Even though they had high priced attorneys going at it. No one cared.  Not the government who if you remember interrupted the epic battle between Dern and Liotta to say ‚Äúno one here cares about the money you spend to waste this courts time‚Äù. And the flash to crying babies and fighting parents behind them. 

IF you know real life then you know Driver had a clean home and safe child. That‚Äôs all the government cares about as the social worker takes her water.

The movie made the lawyer‚Äôs the enemies. Not Scarlet. Which is what exactly happens in divorce. Alan Alda told Driver.",e6l8bc

In Marriage Story, we actually *get to see the woman's side*. It's a lot more fair. Every letter of what Laura Dern's lawyer said to Nicole was true. And to see Nicole thrive so much after cutting Charlie off, you start to think that maybe it really was Charlie and being with him that was dragging her down.",e6l8bc

How is he a narcissist?  I don't think the movie shows a single instance of that.  He is passionate about his work and the business they have built together.  That said, Nicole's feelings are understandable if not well illustrated.  I don't see how not wanting to live in LA and completely change one's lifestyle/career = narcissism.  He literally gave up everything to be near his family at the end.  I actually wish that we had seen some scenes with him behaving more narcissisticly or selfishly because it would've helped me connect with Nicole and her decision to escalate things.",e6l8bc

So she decided to live the life she preferred, and did what she could to get that, while her anger was still pretty fresh.

The writing seemed to portray just how hard it is to have that unfiltered type of communication with the other person ‚Äî where to an observer it seems so simple ‚Äújust tell him/her that!‚Äù ‚Äî but it takes so much in these situations to even get to the point where that wall is broken down enough to be honest to the other person.

faf2a5k,"I think your interpretation is wonderful, but I think differently about it. Because clearly(don‚Äôt know about real life, but as set in the film) real mainstream theater work is in NY. Being in the arts business, I can relate to when something is more of the direction of your dreams(as in pursuing Broadway in the film), and something else is also a ‚Äúgood opportunity‚Äù but not going in the direction of your dream career(UCLA residency). I think she did not express the joy and enthusiasm because she understood that‚Äôs clearly the latter for him, and he did it to be close to his son. She knew exactly what it was, plus maybe the Broadway opportunities and what he could have had, the momentum had gone since the timing of the divorce. That part I don‚Äôt know, but this opportunity clearly wasn‚Äôt what he had ultimately wanted if he could choose everything. It just means nothing like the genius grant or the show going on Broadway for him.

And responding to some other comments about ‚Äúwhy did we go through all of it then‚Äù or ‚Äúhe actually is considerate and not self-centered‚Äù, I definitely disagree because sometimes it takes an experience for someone to hurt enough to finally come around and understand how much their behavior had effected others(or themselves).

2) He cheated on her. Sure, she withheld affection for 1 year, but he still cheated. Would have been better to file for divorce rather than cheat.

If they both agree to ""split"" they both walk away with their pot of money. 

But if you agree to ""split"" and I say ""steal"", I get your pot of money, too. 

But if we both try and be sneaky and say ""steal"", we both walk away with nothing. 

The trick, obviously, is to 100% convince the other person you agree to ""split"", so you can then ""steal"" and double your money. I feel like that's what Nicole was doing the whole film.

fa2a606,"This is very true, but it's also meant to be a bit of a backhanded ducking the question. Because it's true that as someone who doesn't watch much TV series, he's not going to have the most qualified opinion on what makes for a good or bad TV pilot. But you have to keep in mind the context that as prominent as TV is these days, theater is still a slightly snobbier/more sophisticated form for someone like Charlie, so ""I don't watch TV"" is both a very true description of why Charlie can duck having to say what he really thinks of the pilot, but also ties into the way that a genius playwright might look down on the medium.

The dialogue in this movie is just great. Charlie is not trying to belittle Nicole here, he's simply trying to avoid having to answer the question. But it all ties into this true sense in which he valued his own work over other peoples. He's an artist, he prizes the work of the theater company over prospects she could have in TV, not because he's greedy, but because that's just how he sees things (we see his frustration with having to take more commercial theater prospects later in the movie).",e6l8bc
fa5lyw6,"I think it shows how disconnected their communication is. She assumes he‚Äôs being hypocritical in that moment, but he may have meant he doesnt watch television programming as opposed to film, which is what he was watching. It kind of fits the theme of poor communication.",e6l8bc

faax5rj,"I think it's another great example of how moments can be perceived differently by both sides of the relationship ‚Äî and that, while neither side may actually be ""in the wrong,"" one party can still come away feeling slighted when there's poor communication, or a fundamental disconnect between two people.

Although ""I don't ever watch TV, so it's hard for me to tell,"" is mostly a cop-out answer to avoid offending Nicole with his actual thoughts on the pilot, the statement itself may be true. Charlie likely believed that he got out of this interaction without offending, but the camera pans to the movie playing, which suggests that Nicole doesn't see these storytelling mediums (film, theater, television) as being so very different that he isn't capable of giving his opinion on a pilot. 

Once again, in their efforts to avoid an altercation, the couple left one party feeling more resentful than if honest communication was had. Personally, I saw this as being one of the key recurring themes of the movie.",e6l8bc

Nicole was emotionally distressed too, but her step was motivated by a clarity of thought; about what she wanted to do with her life and how this relationship had hindered her growth as a person. It was one of the many gut wrenching moments of the movie where you see their love and affection for each other, yet a relationship which is hurtling towards its end.

Also, the scene was hilarious for the fact that it showed the ruthlessness of the divorce lawyers, here we have two people going through the most difficult process of their lives where choosing what they want for lunch is the least of their priorities, while the lawyers have no problems switching on and off as this is business as usual for them.",e6l8bc

I knew immediately after he said it I had to leave as he had deliberately said the cruelest thing he could to me in an argument.

I also went through family court with my husband when he had to take his ex to court over custody of their children and the movie captured the terrible nature of the system very well. It's the most horrendous thing I've been through. I've told him he should not watch this movie and not sure I should have either tbh, brought it all back after years of forgetting about it.",e6l8bc

Granted, things could have been changed, but we know that at one point Baumbach was with Leigh, did a film with both Leigh and Gerwig, followed that up with Frances Ha, and thereafter his marriage with Leigh ended and now he and Gerwig are the cinephile power couple.

fa1892x,She trusted Nora because Nora was the first person to truly listen to her and talk to her properly. Compare that to the scene of Nicole opening up to Nora to the TV crew obsessing over her or her family making it all about themselves. Nicole took comfort in Nora and Nora was completely set from there.,e6l8bc
fa22f16,"I think the movie shows that Nicole is overall very grateful to Nora and ends up friends with her because Nora is at the party at the end. Obviously she's unhappy with the 55/45 thing, but Nora got her LA which is what mattered.",e6l8bc
fa2we4l,"I mean, in fairness, even in the film, Nora does help Nicole get what she wanted. In that last scene she's in, she gets slightly greedy, but that's really the only scene in which she seems to cross a line for Nicole. The rest of the time she's advocating for exactly what Nicole wants, and until Charlie hires a new attorney, the only ""win"" she seems to push for is the LA vs NY thing.

But it definitely seemed like maybe Baumbach had some residual anger over how his own divorce progressed, which to an extent transfers to the way Nora's tactics are depicted.",e6l8bc
fa21ezw,"I liked Nora! I thought she would be a caricature based on the first scene but she's ultimately a good lawyer.  Aside from that last scene with the 55/45 issue, she listens to her client and does what she needs to do to get her client what she wants.

 And I thought the movie did a good job of showing that even though Nicole and Charlie didn't want to engage lawyers and  wanted a low-key divorce, that was never going to happen. When they tried to work it out amongst themselves, it was a disaster.",e6l8bc
fa184nw,I don't think it was because of Jay. I think it was because of her divorce that she holds feelings towards the whole thing and has to win etc. She toed the line between caring and cunning very well until going a little bit too far right at the end with the 55-45 line.,e6l8bc
fc6dv6p,"I don't think she was awful/acted with a chip on her shoulder throughout the process - other than the last 5% she was acting exactly to represent the wishes of her client. When he had Bert she acted amicably, and when he switched to Jay she was forced to act tougher. She also coached her client on how to deal with the state overseer visit - that's not a chip on her shoulder that's what Nicole needed to hear at the time.",e6l8bc

She just wanted to live a fulfilling life and to have her husband support her dreams but he did not. When you marry you build a life with someone so inevitably if you divorce that life you had will be destroyed. Divorces are really messy and no one really wins because at the end of the day their marriage failed and they have to live with that.

We see this in the scene where they fought when  she said something along the lines that she had already lost because she loved him more than he loved her.",e6l8bc

1: He moves to LA, what was the point in all of this in the end?

2: she gets more time than he does, but at the end of the film, their son is tired and she lets him take him even though it‚Äôs her night, thus making it 50/50. What was the point of all this in the end? 

I think it‚Äôs meant to be ironic. The originally set out to do this all on their own, and then they let lawyers, and money, and brutal fights get in the way, only for them to really do it on their own in the end anyway.",e6l8bc
fd11wp2,"Late here, but the monologue was calculated beyond belief. All the points are right on the money, but I never got the impression that it was truly genuine, and that it was more a power move to make herself seem like an unassailable saint.

The more I think about this film, the more I think that Baumbach didn't make the women characters in this movie look all that great as people.... I almost think that it's to the point where it's a tinge sexist, but that's a complicated and exhausting conversation for another time and place. (And also a can of worms that one shouldn't open toward a Reddit comment from weeks ago.)",e6l8bc

Baffling really.",e6l8bc
famtefc,"Yeah, imo, it was also to show the contrast. The letter reading happened at the very end of the movie, after the divorce and everything was over. 

It contrasted how smitten and in love they were at the start of meeting....with where they were now. Still having ""love"" for each other, but never being the same again as they were at the beginning of their relationship.

I think the last few seconds symbolizes this very well also.

 She still cares for him, clearly has feelings for him,....she helped him tie his shoe...but she lets him go regardless. They still care for each other and will be decent to each other, but...the love they had has morphed into something else. 

It's quite sad. They both just carry this with them now. 

They still care for each other, but that ""love"" will never be the same again. They moved on, both somewhat different and broken people. Still holding emotions for each other. But...that's life....",e6l8bc
fasc8zz,"If we are to discuss when the marriage died then I will say it ended some time before he cheated. The cheating is horrendous but if we are to speak of the death of the marriage it's more like symbol of it's death then the actual death.

The same with the end. It's not a more flexible man standing there. It's a broken man. He's not going to UCLA because he thinks he can build something worthile there. He is going there because he misses his son and he's scared of the thought how easy it would be for them to grow apart due to the NY-LA distance.

We can only theorise how his NY carreer is going by then. Probably he has negelected it due to the divorce. Maybe it's disolved due to his grant money being eaten by his divorce.

Maybe he can build a new life in LA that he will be happy with. In general it seemed the moive was hinting that NY is actually a better town then LA. Seeing that Baumbach has grown up there and lives there it might not be too far fetched.",e6l8bc

This is ""just"" a prestige relationship drama (with plenty of comedy) with some of the biggest superstar actors out there and the coronation of a longtime director. This isn't anything particular to A24, movies like this have existed for decades, made by many other studios. I'm fine with ""A24-like"" being a thing, but Marriage Story would *not* be the example I'd pick.

De Niro, Banderas, Leo, Sandler, are probably the next tier, and if the awards season narratives shifts a bit, any of them could contend with the top 2. And personally, I'd far prefer any of those four to Phoenix... it's such an incredible year for Best Actor, I just don't think Arthur Fleck was up to the standard set by the others.

Nicole states during the argument that he never loved her as much as she did (in her opinion ofc). She also felt like she was the one who was always accommodating to his professional desires rather than her own.

If you're in a marriage where you feel as the love isn't being reciprocated equally and you're constantly living in the other person's shadow, it sort of makes sense that your sex life would eventually die out.

fdfslt2,"I‚Äôm late but here goes:

- Charlie did cheat, and that‚Äôs awful, I was not defending that in my first post and I‚Äôm not defending it here. Cheating is bad, we all know that.

- One of the biggest problems I have with Nicole is her insistence on forcing Charlie to come to LA. Charlie and Nicole met in New York, they began dating in NY, raised Henry in NY, they‚Äôve lived in NY for their entire marriage. If she wanted to get out of NY so bad, maybe she could‚Äôve made up her mind and went back to LA long before they were married or  before Henry was born. It is mentioned that she wanted to and she brought it up and while Charlie is wrong for not considering her desires she just accepted it moved on, then now that they‚Äôre getting a divorce it‚Äôs an issue she keeps pressing. At this point they‚Äôre way to deep in for moving to LA to even be a reasonable option

- Now this next part is more the Director or Writer‚Äôs fault but I find it ridiculous that while their whole life was in NY for some reason they got married in LA, and had Henry in LA. Why? Just because Nicole‚Äôs family is there? What sense does that make? You mean to tell me they actually signed the marriage documents in a different state than they lived???? That‚Äôs something drunk people in Vegas do and it‚Äôs not smart. It would be different if the wedding itself was **held** in LA( you know just like people get married in Hawaii or wherever) but **the actual legal binding documents were signed in LA when they lived in New York???** That‚Äôs crazy.

Then you have Henry being born in LA, why??? Did they fly Nicole out when she was a few weeks away from her due date and just wait it out?? If so, she probably stayed in LA for a few months while she recovers and while Henry grows a bit before they flew back to New York.

All of this to me seems like Nicole hated NY and throughout their marriage she kept forcing them to have significant events in their life in LA. I get that that‚Äôs where she wants to be and that‚Äôs fair, we are all entitled to our preferences, but there‚Äôs a much better way to go about it then forcing your husband to fly across the country when his life and work and deeply tied up in New York. That‚Äôs selfish and manipulative. If she hated NY she should‚Äôve done something about it before they met, or at literally any point during their relationship **before** a kid and a marriage got involved.


- Then you have literally everyone in the movie berating Charlie for simply wanting to live where he‚Äôs always lived. Everyone from Nicole, to her lawyer Nora, to Charlie‚Äôs own lawyer, to that one lawyer assistant to even Henry chastises him throughout the movie and say how much they love LA and NY is so small and cramped. Ok, I get it, but none of them understand that he‚Äôs lived in NY for **years**, his work and entire life is there. He can‚Äôt just leave so easily. (And before you say Nicole came to NY when her whole family was in LA, that was before they met.  Nicole made the choice, of her own will, to move to NY, and now she expects Charlie to come to LA just because she wants to be there.)  The movie doesn‚Äôt take the time to explain that if Henry is 8 years old by the time the divorce is happening, hasn‚Äôt he already been in schools back in New York?? What about all the doctors and clinics he‚Äôs been to growing up, they would have to find new places for him to go to. It‚Äôs not easy uprooting your entire life and moving across the country, but the movie portrays Charlie as the only one seeing the repercussions of the move when all three of them(Charlie, Nicole, and Henry) should be feeling it.


-If it‚Äôs so obvious that Charlie and Nicole aren‚Äôt gonna work as a relationship in New York then why is he punished for her decisions? **She** came to NY, **she** formed a relationship with someone living in and based in NY, **she** proceeded to get married to and have a kid with, someone based in NY, why is Charlie all of a sudden so wrong for not wanting to move to LA?? If she‚Äôs been feeling this way for so long she should‚Äôve done something about it a long time ago.


-Lets also not forget that scene where Nicole first meets her lawyer, Nora. She goes on and one about how they met and how slowly started to lose herself within Charlie‚Äôs world. She felt like everything was on his terms, she did what he wanted and so on. She even confesses that she thought while Henry was both their child, he would be hers more. To me that seems like Nicole is the type to lose herself in a relationship, you know the types that start dating someone and stop hanging out with old friends, stop doing old hobbies, etc. It happens all the time in real life and once again I applaud the movie for its realism, **BUT**, why is Charlie punished for this?? Nicole needs to find out who she is outside of her marriage and that‚Äôs fine but she does it by holding their son hostage across the country and forcing Charlie to comply. She knows he only agreed to let Henry attend school in LA briefly while her pilot filmed. Charlie would never agreed to let Henry go to school in LA because why the hell would he? They‚Äôve lived in NY all this time, he‚Äôs been to NY schools, why would they change that?

Nicole also knows that there‚Äôs no way Charlie will live in a different state than his son, he lives his son and wants to be a present father, so no matter what, he‚Äôs going to be near his son, so by moving Henry to LA she‚Äôs already forcing him to come to LA and that‚Äôs before the divorce is all said and done. Imagine if a father did that to a mother, imagine they kind of reaction people would have. It‚Äôs wrong.

Nicole is the type of person to do immoral and selfish things just because she‚Äôs been wronged. Remember the scene where she admitted to hacking Charlie‚Äôs email? That‚Äôs a crime. Neither of them are perfect but once again, Charlie is the one who suffers way more.

- The argument scene. It was an argument. Whether or not what either of them said(they both said hurtful things) was their true feelings doesn‚Äôt really matter, the damage is done. Mind you now, Charlie had remained cordial and friendly this whole time while Nicole went around to several lawyers( even though the initially agreed not to use lawyers), served him papers, and got an entire case going before he even had a lawyer. The movie also shows us the scene in the courtroom where both of them used minor mistakes( Charlie not buckling the car seat, and Nicole stumbling on the stairs while tipsy) as ammo against each other. From that point on I‚Äôd argue both of them said things they don‚Äôt mean, if you‚Äôve ever been in an argument with a loved one you‚Äôve probably done the same thing, it happens.

It pains me that this movie shows so much realism and fairness in some aspects, but still manages to give Charlie the absolute worst ending possible.

Whereas Driver's character is against these decisions.

fal4hlv,">She could have had a big movie career and sidelined it for love. Over time, she becomes bitter over that. But the real end of the marriage is Charlie's affair. 

The affair feels kind of glossed over in the movie.  It's just kinda weird how we find out about it and then halfway through the movie Nicole actually shows how upset she is about it.  That was something she was keeping to herself, and then lashed out about once she was working with Nora.

>I am endlessly amazed how the comments here skip over the affair because I think that's the root of the contentious divorce.

I don't think the affair is the root of the divorce at all, and I have no idea why you would think that from watching the movie.  I think the root of the divorce is that two people wanted very different things for their futures.  The affair is a symptom of that difference of desire and breakdown of communication, as was the lack of intimacy for a year.  Charlie felt like Nicole hated him(I really relate to this feeling in this context, as I have experience with a dead bedroom), this drove him into the arms of someone who he felt didn't.

>Yet Charlie turns down a year in LA because he prefers Broadway.

Something that really bothers me about the way Nicole's character is shown is that she knew from the beginning that he had Broadway aspirations and was a NY director.  She admits this in her monologue.  We never see her actually try to work in LA, we just hear that she couldn't because of Charlie.  I think expecting someone to give up the last decade of their career and move somewhere they don't like is peak-selfishness, and I would have liked to see some more of what Nicole actually tried to do that was prevented by Charlie.  She signed up for NY when she married Charlie, that should have been obvious to her.  I don't find Nicole sympathetic because we don't actually see her compromise, we just hear about it from her.  Nicole doesn't compromise anything in the movie, presumably because she feels like she already compromised for a large part of their marriage, but in terms of the film that feels unearned.  We see Charlie's compromise and his fears come true as the movie unfolds, which makes him more sympathetic despite the fact that he was likely at least equally at fault for his situation.",e6l8bc
fas1bzd,">Charlie is a relatively selfish person. The extended family is in LA. Nicole has more work options in LA. Yet Charlie turns down a year in LA because he prefers Broadway. 

I love that they touch on Charlie's family situation, because it helps me empathize with Charlie's 'selfishness'. I wonder if Charlie is the way he is because of how he was raised. It sounds like at a young age he had to start thinking about his needs and wants and how he was going to get them because his parents were neglectful and abusive. And if he's so fixated on living in New York because everything he has there he had to scrape together on his own with no supportive family like Nicole has, and no soft place to fall if he loses all of it.",e6l8bc

To me that showed she was ultimately no better than Ray Liotta's very up front shark type lawyer despite her image and window dressing of being more even handed and ""fair""...but end of day she was vindictive and punishing when given the chance even though Nicole did not direct her to do that and objected when she was informed. That's not ""neither bad nor good"", that is bad. It was malicious for the sake of being malicious.

If anything I thought Ray Liotta's character was the more honest and morally neutral of the two because he was so ""what you see is what you get"". As soon as things were no longer contentious/interesting Ray's character kicked the case down to his assistant because the dirty work he was needed for was done. Despite seeming slimy he was exactly who he said he was.

Dern's character brought her personal bias to the table and couldn't stand NOT sticking it to Charlie, somehow.

Alan Alda's lawyer was the voice of reason and pitching it right down the middle, knowing both what would be best and most fair, but also knowing how unlikely that was to occur now that ""the system"" was involved.",e6l8bc

Wasn't a fan of the acting by the lawyers, mother and sister, LA directors/producers, and the social worker.

fc22r4n,"I think the opening and ending scenes are the core of this movie. They're no longer together, but they still love each other (not romantically, but as people). 

In the beginning they have written letters about why they love each other, and though they aren't together, Nicole appreciates and understands Charlie enough to listen to his critique for that nights performance. She cries and doesn't want to share her letter, because she hates how no matter what she will always love him.

The plot only starts when other people force their own narratives onto their relationship, and get involved in their separation. And both Nicole and Charlie feed into that for a while. Until the end, when they've both realized it's gone too far. The ending scene is Nicole tying Charlie's shoe, and letting him have their kid for the night. Because after the facade of their Rollercoaster of a separation, they both still love each other. 

So I think, in that sense, Nicole's casualness is apart of her love for Charlie and who she is as a person. Their phone calls and talks, when no one else is around, is straight forward and honest. Even that big argument scene. It's only when other people are around do we get their projected narratives onto Nicole's and Charlie's relationship, ie Nicole shouldn't be so casual or Charlie shouldn't be so x.",e6l8bc

Nicole, meanwhile, got to live in LA, advance her career, got a new boyfriend, and gets to spend more time with her son. And it's kind of bullshit, because the life she whined about with Charlie was one the SHE CHOSE to have. If we're really going to promote women's right to choose in our social ethics (hint hint), they can't also be allowed to blame the men in their life when things go south.

If they would have done the divorce without lawyers, I think the family would have stayed in NY.

Part of the couple‚Äôs problem was a lack of direct communication, which they were able to ultimately manage through Alan Alda and Laura Dern. Had Charlie not gone to Ray Liota‚Äôs firm, they would have avoided the contentious arguments in the courtroom. Dern‚Äôs character had to match Liota due to his aggressive reputation. 

I also thought that Dern was fair: she gave her client the opportunity to tell her story in a way she had not been able to, and she fought tirelessly for her client to be able to remain in LA, which was Nicole and her son‚Äôs wish. by the ending, it‚Äôs clear LA was a better choice for Nicole and the boy.

Whether or not it was something she should ha e done is up for debate, and this isn't to say Charlie was wrong to hire the new team, but I don't think it was about getting drunk off of misery, so much as it was about being the best advocate for her client as possible, including trying hard to get extras for her client as a consolation for having to go through the battle she fought for her child.",e6l8bc

She is being immature by banning him to the sofa for a fucking year and then has the audacity to meddle with his NEW personal life? come on

This movie depicted Charlie as a decent boyfriend and a GREAT father. It also depicted Nicole as somebody who doesn't know how to talk problems through and only escalate them. She started her relationship with her for selfish reasons, ""to feel alive through somebody"", and when that feeling died down, she took everything with her and ruined her career.

It's not like he forced her to move to NY and start a relationship and theater company with her. But she forced him out of his child and dream.",e6l8bc

fb51pya,"This kind of reminded me of the relationship between the Obamas, in some ways. Michelle Obama was incredibly ambitious, but Barack's ambitions were sky high, and overshadowed her own. That was really hard for her, as she described in her autobiography. How do you stay true to yourself, how do you maintain your own identity, when your partner is a superstar? I think it takes an extremely strong person, and a partner willing to truly listen and compromise. Charlie was not able to see Nicole's true talents and ambitions until the divorce was over and done with. All the compromise came after they were finished.",e6l8bc

They showcased her practice interview and how she would probably flub up a bunch of the answers, hinting that her observation probably actually did go similar to Charlie's - imperfect and awkward and stumbling over her choice of words.

So the script follows Nicole's practice interview and Charlie's actual interview but they end up getting 50/50 (or 55/45) so it's not like the expert thought Charlie was unfit in the end.

fdqeihb,"I mean I guess but it just seems like way too much way too soon. Let's keep in mind before she saud that the last time we left off with her she was only acting in a pilot of a show that may or may not take off. So within the span of what a year? She becomes a director, completes at least one full movie, and on at least one of her first goes she gets nominated for an Emmy. And I feel like a lot of actors make suggestions, especially for her being a mother she knows how to hold a baby, but other than that a lot of actors make comments about how they think their character should be or stuff like that. I just feel like it would've been better to make her get something like an emmy for acting because that's her thing and it would be like oh she did better at her thing when out of the constraint of her husband and she rose to a higher station within her own thing than her ex husband could eothin his station, but the way the movie did it I just feel like it's a slap in the face to Charlie (which the movie is full of to both parties but this one just felt more force in my opinion) because now he doesn't even get to be 'better' at his own thing which I think just kinda sucks. She wins by getting to stay in LA and he has to leave his company, she gets 55% of visitation which isn't her fault but still she wins that way, shes the one with a new love life, her child often appears to enjoy her more.

I mean, she did seem to have more support with her mother and family in LA, so in some ways, it could have been a bit easier for her in that regard, but I would have loved to see her depression during the marriage fleshed out more.

Edit: not ‚Äúor just cut the next scene.‚Äù They did just cut to the next scene. She wrapped up her monologue and there wasn‚Äôt even a reaction shot from Nicole or Dern‚Äôs assistant. It just cut to the next scene and that‚Äôs what made it feel like a 4th wall break.

I also don‚Äôt like how she ended up getting a lawyer, when she and Charlie had agreed not to bring lawyers into this. Nora was awful and a horrible person, but I guess she just represents divorce lawyers.

Either way ""over and over"" was never mentioned and it was clear that from his POV, her wanting to move to LA was not some regular part of her conscious life. The movie is presented from Charlie's perspective as it's somewhat autobiographical. It's not really meant to be ""both sides are the same"" like Kramer vs Kramer or Blue Valentine. 

Nicole could have stayed in LA with her son and remained separated, maybe work it out so the kid spends summers in NY. Instead she totally blindsides Charlie and screws him over by getting lawyers involved, and is completely two-faced about everything. There's no reason for a woman in her situation to do that unless 1.) there's money involved, 2.) he's threatening to take the kid back to NY without her permission, 3.) she needs to get divorced ASAP so she can legally marry someone else.

fdtjbze,"I agree he was a dominant partner. I Had issues with many of the ways he exerted that dominance. The scene where he comments his preference on her hairstyle is in Nicole's own words, ""absurd."" I was completely on her side by that scene. I laughed at the absurdity. Although she liked some of his other more dominant and controlling traits. She liked his tidiness bc she was messy. She liked his sense of certainty when it didn't pertain to toxic aspects like controlling her that made him a great director. Her docile behavior in their marriage was her choice, she admits herself she meshed with him. It might have been part of his duty as a husband to encourage she live her own life outside of him, but in truth that responsibility resides with her.  Her dissatisfaction with little shitty things he does should have been worked through healthily via good communication. The vast majority of people have little aspect(s) of themselves that aren't very healthy for a partner. That should have been part of what their relationship worked on. I'm still holding Charlie accountable while pointing out she has a role to play in making the marriage work too. I don't think Charlie ever sought to enslave her as an ""obedient"" wife, he just went with her more timid nature. he accepted that part of her. His critical nature of it is what made him a bad partner to her. Again this should have been mediated via strong communication. Her dissatisfaction with becoming invisible behind him combined with his more toxic traits are what essentially caused their romance to cease for her. by the time he cheated, he had been sleeping on the couch for a year and they hadn't had sex that whole time. He was still married so it was still a betrayal and fucked up, but their marriage only persisted on bc they had a child to raise, their romantic relationship had ended. Personally I agree with others here that the cheating might have been added to the story to ensure you didn't favor one person too easily. I think what she did to him in the divorce: consciously forcing him to divorce in LA which would cost him his broadway debut, his whole career and dreams, his entire life in NY, > half his time to be involved with his son, and importantly BOTH of their ability to provide for their son's future (college) was more fucked up than his actions. In the divorce she lied to him, forced him to find a lawyer within days or lose all custody and assets, actively blocked him from using a dozen or more local lawyers in a city he's not as familiar with, used his behavior when trying to figure this all out while still seeing his son against him in court, being straight up vindictive in her attempt to get  back at him for what he did to her in the marriage, etc. The more I analyze the movie the more I don't respect her decisions in the divorce process and more importantly why she did them. he wasn't the perfect partner, not a good one in some ways, but she had a role to play in that. He didn't deserve to lose everything bc of that and lose his ability to provide for their son's future. She traded his happiness and their son's future somewhat for her own personal interests. Thats very selfish, particularly when the child's life is negatively impacted. I know parents that saw the financial burden of divorce and what it would ruin for their dreams for their kids and they selflessly decided to separate without toxic greedy lawyers for the good of the child. She lost sight of that in favor of finding personal freedom and identity.",e6l8bc

fa9zm4d,"Did he though? It honestly didn't seem like he grew much at all during the movie. I think you could argue that him taking up residency at UCLA was close but I've seen some people interpret that ending as him not even realizing what he was doing, which is read in Nicole's response to that news and him asking ""are you ok?"" I thought it was more him giving in, but I still don't think he grew all that much. 

I take your points though. But for me I think it started even from the beginning. When they leave the party, for example - or she leaves - and he follows her angrily on the train just staring at her. That's creepy behavior.

I am a guy, but I don't know if you meant general you or me specifically. 

But yeah, him yelling at the kid wasn't a good look. And I think there's a big difference between cursing at someone and cursing in general. For example I'd curse in front of my parents I'd NEVER curse *at* my parents. So personally I think what he did was much worse.",e6l8bc

People are just being biased if they can‚Äôt understand this. Nicole was into the marriage more than Charlie ever was, he said so himself that he didn‚Äôt really want to get married. He wasn‚Äôt fighting for their relationship, just Henry. So was Nicole. Lawyers were going to get involved no matter what regardless of what Charlie wanted.

To me it says he didn't respect her work unless it was working for him. That's also why he assumed she was nominated for acting and hadn't considered/known she was directing.

Nora successfully manipulated both characters so she could get money out of the estate by playing ""sympathetic ear"" type character.

Can't agree at all here. I absolutely don't see that as what the film is trying to say. The kid saying he likes LA more is not proof that it's better for him. The film shows that he is in a 'mommy phase' and that kids in this situation often lie to tell people what they want to hear.

Nicole also makes small mistakes as a parent as well - being drunk, and bribing him - just like Charlie makes small mistakes like getting frustrated and not paying close enough attention. 

Think about it this way - do you think Nicole would stay in LA if the TV show was filmed in Toronto? She's in LA for her job, just like Charlie was in NY for his job.

Nicole absolutely didn't get everything she wanted.

All she wanted to be happily married and have a happy family and she lost that. She literally says this in the film and at the end, gives this incredibly pained look when Charlie mentions that he's going to move to LA for a bit. It's like why did they go through all that? What was the fucking point of everything?

She's not faultless in the relationship and everything that happens after but had he given more interest and more attention to his wife, had he been able to compromise then they wouldn't be in the situation. On Charlie's side, we see that he could only learn to compromise and not be so self centred after losing everything. He's able to give up the theatre and put the needs of his child and his relationship with his child first. That's not something that Charlie would have done at the start of the film.

That's the tragedy in their relationship and it's spelled out right there.

I get that this film hits a very recognizable and relatable chord. I also thought that Adam Driver was superb. Scarlett is one of my favorite actresses.

His ex wife had made a new life, and seemed upset that he would be moving to LA and impossing on it. The final sequence was heartbreaking.

I‚Äôve witnessed and experienced arguments like that, and it‚Äôs essentially breaking the seal of all the raw emotion and pent up rage that stems from an unhealthy relationship. The longer the argument goes on the more the endgame becomes cutting the other person as deep as you feel they‚Äôve cut you. It‚Äôs this continual exchange of harder and harder blows, and it eventually breaks someone to the point where they say something as drastic as Charlie‚Äôs ‚ÄúI wish you were dead‚Äù line.

Her motivation for the split was that she needed to establish an identity for herself outside of their marriage and professional partnership. She thrived on her own in LA and him being in NYC meant they could be successful independently. But if they're part of the same ecosystem again then all of a sudden their accomplishments are relative again, which is especially difficult for two naturally competitive people. Not that they're directly competing, just that on an emotional level Nicole suddenly found herself occupying shared space again, which is what she had just gone through hell to escape.

Anyway, I've seen far worse in (non-family) practice. I felt that this film depicted maybe a little sharp practice, but nothing egregious. Maybe more a casualty of the entire family law system (which is admittedly fucked) than the individual lawyers themselves, I would say.",e6l8bc

Heat is a fantastic movie with both De Niro and Pacino going at it finally, and more recently There Will Be Blood. The list is long. 

If you're looking for something similar to Marriage Story, Kramer vs Kramer is probably the best version of this although the story is a little more one-sided.

Like that works perfectly and reads well. But my question of the scene is the very obvious camera movement (probably the most film-y movement in the whole movie) that glances at the tv being on but it being on a vapid *movie* on mute is an odd choice by the director of the movie. Cause he could‚Äôve had it on I Love Lucy or The Simpsons or anything but it was a movie on mute. 

But as I said, on it being The Money Pit on mute is probably just me overthinking it cause the point you mentioned reads so well. But to me, it‚Äôs akin to someone saying their kid reads too many comic books but you see that the kid is reading Watchmen or Maus.

What makes it worse is that they are still living together in the film, I assume because it would be pointless to get two separate dwellings when Scarlet is moving out to California in a short enough amount of time.  Also we don't know whether or not Scarlet's character hacking the computer to find out about the infidelity comes at the beginning of the altercations or later on.  We don't see every moment of their relationship so we are stuck speculating about all of this.

fdgx632,"> One of the biggest problems I have with Nicole is her insistence on forcing Charlie to come to LA.

The argument between Nicole and Charlie about LA v NY isn't so much about LA and NY but about how they view and treat each other in the relationship. 

Nicole went into the relationship expecting that they would eventually move back to LA in the near future whereas for Charlie it was something more akin to a ongoing conversation/discussion that most couples have. Maybe it's that holiday they never go on or that fridge that never gets cleaned. What basically starts off as a minor issue turns into a big one since the two never communicate about it properly.

Also Nicole doesn't hate NY. She says she was happy with where she was but the way Charlie was always so constantly dismissive of her and not giving a shit about the pilot (until it became important to him) when it was so important to her was the last straw. 

After which she thinks, 'hey, I've given ten years of my life to this man, it's time to get my own'. 

She then starts off putting Charlie's needs front and centre in the divorce but as time goes by, puts her own needs first at the cost of hurting him. She only stops when her son might get hurt next. 

I don't think you're suppose to see her as a bad person, just somebody caught up in the moment and in a legal system that actively punishes the loser.

> It‚Äôs not easy uprooting your entire life and moving across the country, but the movie portrays Charlie as the only one seeing the repercussions of the move

The family also made the move to Copenhagen, a city in another country just for Charlie without any problem while at the same time, Charlie turned down a similar short term stay in LA because he didn't like the job. It's not like Charlie was stuck in NY. He didn't want to move for anyone unless it was in his own self interests.

>still manages to give Charlie the absolute worst ending possible.

This is such a bad take.

At the end of the film, Charlie finally has a successful broadway run. He's grown as a person and is no longer as self centred as he was. Instead of putting the theatre first, his son is now his first priorty.
And on top of all this he ends up with a prestigious gig at UCLA.

He's also able to rebuild his relationship with Nicole's family, including starting a new one with her current boyfriend. Charlie doesn't 'win' the divorce (nobody does) but he's a better person for it.

I think people trying to figure out who suffers more or who won the divorce miss the entire point of the film.

All Nicole wanted was to be happily married and all Charlie wanted was just to be loved except they've lost that. 

We see it in Charlie's reactions to his son reading Nicole's letter and in Nicole's response to Charlie moving to LA that whatever new thing they have in their lives is never going to make up for that loss that they've both suffered. The only way forward is to move on and try to make sure that they're doing everything they can for their son.",e6l8bc
fdml5bt,"Cheating is bad, but don't forget the line that charlie said, and I'm paraphrasing, ""yeah but it was when I was already on the couch"". Considering many other aspects of this movie had subtle touches, this is a *heavy* nod in the direction that they were almost or already feeling like their marriage is over, as if this hadn't happened too far in the past compared to when this story takes place. A loving albeit one-sided marriage doesn't fall apart over night.",e6l8bc

ff4myk9,"I'm not disagreeing with your take. But at the same time, I just keep thinking about what Nicole wants and what is best for her, independent of her ex-husband. Nicole wanted to move to California and it is where she will be fulfilled.

It would have been easier for everyone involved if Nicole did not contest the whole ""new york"" problem, but this just seems like it puts the burden/onus on Nicole to sacrifice what she wants. Isn't her happiness post-marriage just as valid as Charlie's? 

There is what Charlie wants and there is what Nicole wants and both are not obligated to concede.

fal6f1t,"> I don't think the affair is the root of the divorce at all, and I have no idea why you would think that from watching the movie.  

Charlie is up for mediation and Nicole is the one who hires the tough lawyer.   Nicole is presented as a people pleaser, but she's the one who brings out the big guns.  I think the affair is the reason for that.

>The affair is a symptom of that difference of desire and breakdown of communication, as was the lack of intimacy for a year. Charlie felt like Nicole hated him, this drove him into the arms of someone who he felt didn't.

I think the affair is a symptom of their marriage breaking down, but I don't think Charlie actually says he thought Nicole hated him before the affair.  He is much more amendable until he gets the phone call from Nicole's lawyer.

I don't think a female character's infidelity would be handwaved away as ""he drove her into the arms of their mutual co-worker.""  I think Redditors are treating Charlie's infidelity less seriously because he is a man.

>We never see her actually try to work in LA, we just hear that she couldn't because of Charlie.

I don't think Charlie kept her chained to the radiator.  Nicole is a people pleaser, not a street fighter (thus her choice of lawyer).  But I don't doubt she talked about moving to LA.  The movie not only tells us she did, the movie also tells us Nicole and Henry had spent entire summers in LA.  Nicole's passivity is an issue in their marriage, but I don't think the movie wants you to give Charlie a pass.  Charlie is presented over and over again as someone who doesn't listen.  He didn't listen to Nicole, he doesn't listen to his lawyers, he doesn't listen to Henry.

>She signed up for NY when she married Charlie, that should have been obvious to her.

If they were older and he was more accomplished, I'd understand why you think she signed up for his life.  But the movie repeatedly says when they met, they were young and she was the bigger name.  Tons of people shift between Hollywood and Broadway over the course of their career.",e6l8bc

I think Nicole had flaws. But so did Charlie and Nicole made space and considered him so Charlie should do the same because that's marriage.

From his perspective, ‚Äúshe was happy until she wasn‚Äôt‚Äù. 

Charlie didn‚Äôt ‚Äúsee her as a separate person‚Äù because as far as he knew, growing the theater company was a shared goal that he thought they both were passionate about. That‚Äôs why he kept assuming that Nicole would come back to New York despite the divorce. Even through the process, it took him a long time to realize she wanted to be separate from all of it, not just him.

How could he hear her if she couldn‚Äôt speak up? She even said to Nora that she was happy until she realized she was FC which is the exact thing Charlie says in their fight, but suddenly he‚Äôs wrong for it? 80% of the marital problems in the film are presented through her perspective so it‚Äôs easy to assume he did everything wrong, but it‚Äôs clear that they eventually wanted separate things out of life and neither of them communicated it well, if at all.",e6l8bc

But when she grew and changed, he literally could not see it, nor accept it, nor adapt.  And he lost a lot because of that.

If you think Nicole won then go back and watch the last couple of scenes with her. Have a look at her reaction when she's told she 'won' or when she finds out that Charlie is finally moving to LA. Have a look at the way the camera focuses on Nicole's face and the expression she makes. 

Does she look happy to you? Does she look like somebody who's won? What do you think the director is trying to say by adding that scene in and framing it that way?

Charlie even asks if she's okay, we see that she isn't but that she'll move forward with their life.

> He lost his life and social network in New York because he wanted his son, he had to change jobs

The film made it clear that this was never actually an issue for Charlie. He had no problems moving to Copenhagen for his work but he turned down a similar stint in LA because he just didn't want to.

At the beginning of the film, Charlie is a selfish and narcissistic person, it's great for his work but terrible for all the close relationships he has. At the end of the film, he's able to shed a huge part of that and put his son as his first priorty. He has a respectable residency at UCLA and can now dedicate more time to being with his son. He's able to rebuild a new relationship with Nicole's family and this is all presented as a good thing.

Edit - Also, she went ahead and got a lawyer, and was the party that seemed to want a divorce. She was the aggressor in basically every aspect, and got what she wanted in the end.


I don't really want to call either party right or wrong, because Charlie was obviously incredibly narcissistic to the point that he could hand-wave his cheating. But I will say that Nicole absolutely fucked him over in the divorce. She made him choose between his established career in New York or being a dad. That's unfair.

---

I think that's the bias though, because it very clearly shows both characters with their flaws and their pros. Also, again, I think you entirely missed the concept of the movie entirely, which upsets me.

That wasn't the point. SHE saw him as sympathetic, but when in love, one may be blind, which was a whole part of the movie. Same thing can be said about her too.

Each of the two characters were some of the best written fictional characters I have ever seen, the most three dimensional for sure. There was no bad guys (well, maybe the lawyers, they were fuckheads), but only two people who went through a nasty divorce. Every single person has their flaws, except now they saw them in each other.

It's shown PERFECTLY at the start of the movie, and throughout shows how they aren't EXACTLY like how they see each other. Sure, there is similarities, but no single person is perfect. Especially when you're with one single person with a decade, it can get tedious, no?

I'll give you an example, at the start of the movie they go over what they love about each other. Some of it is true but:

---


**Nicole on Charlie**

* Says he loves being a Dad, yet throughout the movie he is so preoccupied with winning custody of said child, and his job, etc., he barley pays attention to his kid, only to really use him as a tool during the weird ass 'expert' visit.

* ""He's very clear about what he wants."" Yes, he is. But that's the naive, optimist, part of her. In reality Charlie is very selfish and not very conscientious. It is not intentional, he is made to be a director, to be percice and demanding and know EXACTLY what is right. For him. In reality, he is very (unintentionally) self absorbed and almost narcissistic.

* ""He rarely gets defeated, ***which I feel, I always do***"" is essentially her seeing him as a rock. He isn't. He is a very emotional person, as you can see in the argument scene where he wishes she was straight up dead. It's true, he doesn't get defeated, but this is because he is *stubborn* and refused to see it any other way but his own. I.e., L.A.

* ""He never lets any persons opinions get in the way of what he wants to do"" Again, she sees this as a pro, but in reality it is not. It is a con in some cases. Sure, it's good to not give a fuck what other people think about you, but there comes a point when you are not always correct. He is stubborn, thinking he is always right.

* ""He is stuck in his own world."" This is the ONE to look at, if any. She sees this as a total pro. It isn't.

* Again, the sympathetic thing, he isn't really. If you watch, Charlie is a very selfish character. I am not sure how you got the idea that the movie is biased towards him.


So I wanted to point out specifically Nicole's point of view of Charlie, because we never got to see her reading or hearing his, because the things he said about her were true. She is all of those good things. He knows how to gauge people. It is shown that throughout the film, she is not a very good judge of character. Yes she has many flaws, but the reason the film focused much more on the things she said about him was because he didn't realize these things.

**Charlie on Nicole**

* Charlie was naive until about halfway through the movie, refusing to accept that his wife, who he saw as one of the most caring people in the world, got one of the most cutthroat lawyers in L.A, saw a ton of lawyers so he couldn't see them, pulled shady tactics, and yet he still decided to go with a garbage lawyer because he wanted to see the best in her, and refused to accept what was going on around him. She buttered up her child with constant presents, lied to him about L.A, essentially took his kid from him etc. He constantly told the people he was talking to ""Oh, Nicole wouldn't do that"" or ""Oh, we agreed not to see lawyers.""

* ""She makes people feel comfortable ~ she listens"" I personally see this, due to her personality throughout the movie, as him failing to see her kind of pseudo-self. IMO Nicole doesn't know what she wants, Charlie is right about that, she has no idea until suddenly she does, and it ruins her life. She is a YES woman. She says yes in the moment, agrees in the moment, and takes the ideas to heart later and finally realizes the consequences. This can easily be seen when she talks about her first fiance when she was 19/20. She cheated on him with Charlie, and then justifies this saying she was young, didn't know what she was doing (which  may be true, may not be idk).

* ""Good present gifter, good player, good dancer etc."" These are all physical things, which can be said about Charlie more actually and another comment on his selfishness, most of his stuff said about Nicole aren't truely about her personality, much like hers was about him, it's more in the moment things.

---

Overall, I think you fail to see the fucking amazing 3D characters that Noah wrote, it's absolutely wild. The whole point of this is that they were both SOOO blind to the others' flaws it ruined them, and it was because they were in love.

It was for a TV show and it was probably pretty quick.",e6l8bc
fed6r47,"I think the movie was trying to paint a difference between theater and television (among other things). The holding the baby scene was suppose to let us see that. Maybe it is to show why Charlie's opinion of television is correct or to show how different the couple's wants are. Perhaps it is also to show that the theater company was as much Nicole's as it was Charlie's. Nicole was not only the actress but also provides directions in her own way. Reminder that Charlie is painter as selfish because he is always thinking of the theater company but in a way the theater company is their ""family"" and attributes the success of the company to Nicole as well.",e6l8bc

fayv6yw,"This is exactly my same sentiment. Her decision to take things to court despite Charlie being super civil about them splitting as long as he got fair custody was really fucked up.

They even mention several times how all the money they put into the big lawyer stuff could have went into their son‚Äôs future.

Like if he was one of those people that was holding her emotionally hostage and making wild demands then I would totally understand ambushing him with the lawyer but it wasn‚Äôt like that at all.",e6l8bc
fcynrlf,"The point of the movie is that when communication breaks down, people revert to biological algorithms. If you aren't running a program, a program is running you.

What they should have communicated was in those letters in the beginning. It was all there in subtext. They loved and admired each other, but she had meshed with him, losing herself, and he had gladly allowed that to happen without considering her needs. He needed to be more emotionally intelligent. She needed to stand up for herself. If they had put that on the table, and then revealed that he valued his career and the family he had created in NYC and she valued her career and the family she was born with in LA, they might have found a solution, or they may have agreed to split amicably years earlier, but they never did that, and the result was destruction through avoidance and resentment.

He was wrong because he created an atmosphere in which she felt she couldn't express her wants nor have them met if she did. She didn't want to lose him, or their marriage, but felt emotionally disconnected from him romantically because he had reduced her life to a tiny box of his own desires. When that happens in the real world, the sex stops, someone moves to the couch, and then someone eventually cheats. It's so common that it might as well be a computer program that is set to run under the right conditions and play out exactly as it did here.

That's not to say she was in the right, but her actions resulted from him assuming she would do the ""right"" thing, which was to keep his best interests a priority, which was the whole reason they were separated in the first place, but he couldn't see it. When she started asserting herself, alone, she looked for guidance from someone who turned out to be a poor choice, a lawyer, and then the damage began to mount, and yeah, this also happens a lot. The person who gets ruined is often the man, but that's because it's his life that she is extricating herself from. She meshed so completely with it, that she has nothing of her own upon which to build her new life and self.

She was wrong because the way she chose to escape that atmosphere destroyed any hope of reclaiming their marriage or their former lives. When she realizes it, they both start doing the right things too late. Saying the things they should have said too late.",e6l8bc

faryi0v,">she could have easily gotten everything she wanted without a lawyer.

It's clearly shown that she couldn't get anything she wanted, even before the divorce, as what she wanted was to spend more time in New York and Charlie always brushed opportunities to do so off and pushed them off to 'someday'.

Also, not a bit of a stretch. Monogamy is a defining quality of traditional marriage.",e6l8bc
faw9bt2,He did cheat... With their coworker. She even asked him after the divorce was being finalized if they could fuck again.,e6l8bc
fasnvre,"> The movie did not mention her bringing up moving to LA ""over and over.""

Yes, it does.  She says it in her monologue with Laura Dern and it is reiterated in the big meeting with Alan Alda.

I think Nicole could have done more to communicate with Charlie.  She's a people pleaser and he's a steamroller, so he didn't really understand how frustrated she was.

>The movie is presented from Charlie's perspective as it's somewhat autobiographical. It's not really meant to be ""both sides are the same"" like Kramer vs Kramer or Blue Valentine. 

I don't think the movie is balanced.  It is very much from Charlie's perspective.  But I think the movie makes a real effort to show Charlie's flaws.  I don't think the movie presents him as a victim.

>Nicole could have stayed in LA with her son and remained separated, maybe work it out so the kid spends summers in NY. 

I don't think Charlie would have agreed to that without lawyers.

>Instead she totally blindsides Charlie and screws him over by getting lawyers involved

She was too angry at him for mediation to work.  But I don't think he was blindsided.  Not only were they already in the process of divorcing when she hired Laura Dern, Charlie cheated.  You can't really expect an easy divorce when you cheated on them.

Charlie expected an easy divorce because he was used to getting what he wanted.  They had a steamroller/people pleaser dynamic.

> We learn later she did it impulsively out of anger and spite

It wasn't an impulsive decision.",e6l8bc
fayvq6m,"She ultimately made the choice to put her dreams aside, she doesn‚Äôt get to blame him for that. He did not hold her hostage. **Them splitting for her dissatisfaction with her choice and sacrifices is perfectly fine and valid** but the way she went about it was really underhanded, even with the cheating, because the stakes were more than just him and her or their material possessions, it was custody of their only child. I would be more sympathetic to her if this was a story about a childless couple or if Charlie was a deadbeat dad, but the second her lawyer came at him like a shark talking about removing all custody and how she talked to Nicole about it before calling him(making her fully complacent in the threat) made me really disgusted.",e6l8bc
fed5o5z,"If you go back to the letter than she wrote for him, you'll see that a big part of what Charlie said about her during the breakdown scene was accurate. She herself didn't know what she wanted and Charlie was the direction (he's a director, get it?). Yes she wanted to live in LA but she didn't ""decide"" that it was a deal breaker in their relationship until the pilot came along (where she eventually becomes a successful ""director"" herself). Charlie is now cornered by everything that happened before then because the what was an idea before became a requirement now. Rewatch the beginning and you'll see that she was absolutely happy during a large portion of the ten years.",e6l8bc

For me I was just showing how the movie exposed an emotional point of Drivers character and let him look bad about the cussing.  Meanwhile if you aren‚Äôt paying attention she gets equally as pissed about a board game.

Great movie!",e6l8bc
fa8xrl2,I didn't get that at all. I think there was blame all around for not communicating well but both parents cared for the child. I think each has their turn to be the bad guy where you can see opportunities to deescalate the situation that they passed up.,e6l8bc
fbhsd2e,Yeah I think the film did a good job showing you how his behavior changes based on which parent he was around. Nicole gave him a more stable life with a nice school and having an extended family. Charlie's life is more hectic and he's less patient with Henry. Also let's be honest children tend to prefer their mothers.,e6l8bc

I didn't sympathize that much about Charlie sleeping with someone else while separated either. It wouldn't be anyone's shining moment, but separation is a gray area which ties back to clarity and boundaries. I guess I feel Nicole's decisions totally overshadowed Charlie's mistake because she lead the divorce with them. Charlie's mistake didn't uproot Nicole's life the same way. Finally, I too, was ambivalent about the kid.",e6l8bc

Henry told him what he wanted but Charlie chose to view it as something that was flexible because it wasn‚Äôt what he wanted to hear. And instead of admitting he was trying to force Henry to wear the costume, he asked Nicole to convince him because he‚Äôs happy to have Henry pretend to like the costume even if he knows it‚Äôs because Nicole forced him to do it.

She clearly has communication problems. She wasn't even willing to do the mediation in the beginning. Instead of letting him know she wanted to get lawyers involved she just did it without warning.


If the dynamics of the relationship were Nicole as the supporter and Charlie as the leader of the household, then everything that transpired is clearly Nicole's fault. If she didn't want the relationship to be that way, then she should've spoke up and/or they should have never gotten married.

I also think you had the wrong expectations. That was not the right moment for them to have a real conversation. Charlie just got his asshole, the bad part is just starting.

The movie kept showing that Charlie and Nicole‚Äôs break up was a feeding fest for others. That‚Äôs why in the beginning they had all the random talk by the secondary characters talking about them.   The movie is a serious hatred on lawyers in divorce. Alan Alda told Driver how it was going to end in the very first mediation.  It ended exactly how he told him except you get to see Adam Driver pay a $25k check to his lawyers. Which Alan Alda told him was going to happen.

It made me reconsider my own parents divorced when I was a child, even though I did not fully understand the mechanics of what was happening so much felt familiar.

Secondly, it also hit hard on the front of just having previous been in long term relationships. Detangling yourself from another person is brutal. The apartment scene honestly felt like a flashback from my own worst moments, even if no lawyers are involved. Having such rage and anger at someone you still care about give way to utter despair was frigtehendly relatable. 

The movie was incredibly well written, every scene paid off by the end. I loved them showing the simple ways they interacted in very relaxed ways that turned in to utter bullshit attacks in court. There was no Chekov's gun, they were Chekovs landmines. Innocuously hidden but utterly destructive when triggered.",e6l8bc

fbd8xsj,"Okay I kinda want to dispute this.

Personally I didn't hate Nora's character, I was more ambivalent to her than anything else. Yes, she's definitely manipulating Nicole but that's literally her job. Nicole knew what she was getting into approaching her, that's shown by her initial hesitation to get a lawyer. At first the emphasis on Nora removing her shoes and cozying up on the couch came off to me as creepy/manipulative but I think it's more meant to show Nora is more than willing to get genuinely emotional and intimate with clients. That connection helps her win and appears to be a part of her intuitive tool set, so to me it wasn't really wicked that her emotions were useful in causing Nicole to escalate things even further. That's just how it went. We all use our own emotions on others to a degree, whether we want to admit it or not, and she's a bit crass about it, but again, she's a divorce lawyer. Doesn't mean the emotion and connection weren't real to a degree. They do seem to actually end up being friends after the divorce.

The lawyers ordering lunch so casually and being friends while attacking each other's clients speaks ill of the system, and the lawyers themselves to a degree for participating in it, but I don't think it really paints them as utter sharks.",e6l8bc

While Nicole was the bigger asshole during the divorce, I came away from the movie fully believing that Charlie was the bigger asshole during the marriage and that the movie is truly Noah's reckoning of his role in his marriage's downfall.  The cheating thing is much worse IRL and I feel like it was dumbed down for this movie to make Charlie *less* of a villain, I don't think it was introduced to make Nicole sympathetic.

The reason I thought Nora was a good lawyer was that she didn't try to gut Charlie the first go around--she was fair, articulated Nicole's side, respected Nicole's wishes to prioritize LA and not fight over other things, and got a quick result. I think Nora and Bert were in agreement that the best thing for Charlie to do was take the deal they mediated. But, when Charlie decided to fight the Los Angeles issue, Nora had to escalate and behave badly to get Los Angeles  (""the system rewards bad behavior""). 

It's hard for me to see how they would have resolved the LA issue without lawyers. Even when Charlie's lawyer told him he wasn't going to win on that issue, Charlie still couldn't accept it and/or fought it so Henry would know Charlie fought for him.",e6l8bc

Then again, I think that this whole situation would have been better without lawyers, and that if she just talked it out with Charlie, and did their marriage counselling/therapy the right way, things would have been different (good different that is).  

I don't think the movie necessarily paints a bad or good picture for either of them, as you see the cons and pros of each of them. However, because the movie is seen from Charlie's perspective for the most part, it kind of swayed me to see it in his perspective as well.",e6l8bc
fauttz3,">  I don't think anyone is required to stay in a sexless marriage, but if  Charlie had moved towards divorce instead of cheating, the whole story  could have played out differently 

Charlie still loved Nicole, or the idea of her or the idea of the marriage or just his life with her. Pick one you like =) The movie is telling us that they still loved each other at least before the lawyers where involved. Nicole didnt' like her life in the marriage. She didn't like herself. The marriage was dead because of this. Charlie could have kept the marriage going like it was for years, maybe indefinitly. Nicole couldn't. That's not to say the marriage was good. It just worked for him as it was. His whole life worked for him.   


So Charlie started sleeping on the couch and after X months that pretty much was it for the marriage. What was missing was the talk. The step where they aknowlegeded what had happened and what was happening(the divorce). Nicole moving was more the step then the cheating(which she had some suspicions about). It gave her a oppertunity to open up to Charlie why they where over. To say why they had been over for a while now.   


> He has a prestigious job in LA and he can return to Broadway later.  It is absurd to act like his career is ruined 

For Charlie there was a vast difference. Me personally I haven't worked in the theater world in either city. I haven't been to any of them. I could assume that directing a play in LA isn't that much worse then NY. For me it wouldn't such a step down. Maybe even a blessing in disguise if he connects to the material, the actors or the theaterscene in LA.  


For Charlie this wasn't on the map until his kid moved there. For him it was unthinkable. Whatever the reason was might seem superficial and silly to others but clearly was very important to Charlie. Not becasue some selfish idea of his but because of the difference of the scenes in these cities/coasts.  


Maybe he will like it in the future, who knows. But at that moment in the movie he was a broken man.",e6l8bc

feso5pb,"Watching now, but I don‚Äôt think so far that this is 100% fair. It‚Äôs painting Nicole as if she was so cunning and planned some vicious attack. It again, falls on her lack of communication and ability to be honest and state what she wants. She sees a lawyer which is wrong of her, but clearly just wants to be heard. Seems like a therapist may have been a better move. Her lawyer the decides ‚Äúfuck it we‚Äôre gonna take this man for everything he‚Äôs got‚Äù and she only quietly expresses that she doesn‚Äôt really want that. she never stops her lawyer and speaks up and says ‚Äúno. You‚Äôre misinterpreting me. I want a divorce, I want to be legally not married. I don‚Äôt want to take this man‚Äôs grant money. Do not go that route.‚Äù she‚Äôs too afraid to speak up. Same thing with LA. He never wanted to move, she never really pressed the issue and said ‚Äúthis is extremely important and I absolutely intend on returning to LA full time, sooner rather than later.‚Äù   
   
Her behavior was problematic. Charlie was self-absorbed. But I don‚Äôt see her as malicious, necessarily. She just lets everyone take over for her and put her in the back seat, and eventually she just leaves/goes scorched earth. Leaving everyone around her to be like ‚Äúwhat? If you felt this way why didn‚Äôt you take a stance on it and make it known, loud and clear?‚Äù  
   
  
To me, it was a good portrayal of both sides. He steamrolled her sometimes, but also, she even mentions how attentive of a listener he is but she never actually brought up what she wanted. Never more than a ‚Äúhey I was kinda thinking maybe x‚Äù instead of being up front and honest. It‚Äôs even mentioned by her lawyer, when she says ‚Äúoh what so when you state something it‚Äôs a decision but when she does it‚Äôs a discussion?‚Äù...and it‚Äôs hard because yes. That‚Äôs exactly what it is. He always said I want X and have a goal of doing Y. That‚Äôs a statement and decision. She always said ‚ÄúI was maybe thinking X but I‚Äôm not sure when or where or how what do you think‚Äù, which isn‚Äôt a decision.

fdh5h2l,"That too! She just completely stacked the deck and pushed his hand on the situation. I guess I just didn‚Äôt buy the cheating part to the story because of how she acted towards Charlie during the rest of the film prior to, and even after the reveal. Kissing him and greeting him with a hug before he was served, ordering for him during the divorce meeting, indulging him for the notes he wrote about her performance, and even defending him to her own lawyer before she really hit the fan. 


It just seemed like they made light of the cheating angle, while at the same time, using it as the catalyst for their divorce and this ultimate betrayal that neither Charlie or Nicole seemed hugely bothered by. Yes, Charlie was a narcissistic asshole who was full of himself and made promises he never kept, but we‚Äôre constantly reminded of what a great dad he is, and how amazing he is to his theatre and acting family. It ultimately positioned Nicole as someone fueled by jealously that she wasn‚Äôt the number 1 focus of his entire life, when there were so many other moving pieces that made sense. 


Had there not been the cheating angle, I would have sided with Charlie on everything, and I think the writers realized that and added the cheating point later in the process so that viewers wouldn‚Äôt overwhelmingly side with him.

He says it during the fight.  Nicole asks if he loves her(the women he cheated with) and he says something like ""No, but she didn't hate me.  I felt like you hated me.""  Likely due to a year of little to no physical intimacy.

>I don't think a female character's infidelity would be handwaved away as ""he drove her into the arms of their mutual co-worker."" I think Redditors are treating Charlie's infidelity less seriously because he is a man.

I literally explained personal reasons of why I felt that.  It's not hand-waving, and despite understanding it I still think him cheating was wrong.  Maybe try reading what I actually write instead of making sweeping, baseless, emotional assumptions?

>Nicole's passivity is an issue in their marriage, but I don't think the movie wants you to give Charlie a pass. Charlie is presented over and over again as someone who doesn't listen. He didn't listen to Nicole, he doesn't listen to his lawyers, he doesn't listen to Henry.

Finding someone sympathetic isn't ""giving them a pass"".  Both of them fucked up.  I just connected more with Charlie and wish Nicole had more of a set up.  You seem to be trying to make this into who was more wrong.  I don't care about that because it's silly.  I'm talking about the way the movie treated its characters and how I personally connected with them. 

>But the movie repeatedly says when they met, they were young and she was the bigger name. Tons of people shift between Hollywood and Broadway over the course of their career.

She knew his aspirations.  Marriage doesn't just happen.  She was self-admittedly indecisive and went along with him, until she didn't.

faqg86i,">I think you probably shouldnt have been with the person you were dating. And Charlie and Nicole shouldnt be together either. 

I agree with both of these opinions.


>But this idea that you shouldnt consider your partners feelings or what makes them happy because they dont strong-arm you for it is terrible...

Where did I say this?  What are you talking about?  Nicole outright refuses to communicate multiple times in the movie.  Charlie never fucking listens.  There is no requirement for someone to strong-arm, just basic communication.


>I think Nicole had flaws. But so did Charlie and Nicole made space and considered him so Charlie should do the same because that's marriage. 

I never said either of them was flawless, once again you're putting words in my mouth. 

>And feeling like someone you love hates you happens ALL the time. We don't make decisions that will permanently damage our relationship because of it.  And infidelity is never justified imo. Sad you condone it because of a rough patch.

What's sad is your lack of reading comprehension, and also your attempt to project and generalize your own behavior for the sake of moral authority.  People cheat for far lesser reasons than feeling like they are hated or unloved.  Many people feel like they've already lost the relationship at that point.

There isn‚Äôt really much in the film that should lead you to believe that, you‚Äôre making conjecture.

She got a big name lawyer, and stacked all the legal cards in her favor by saying her song permanently lives with her in LA and enrolling him in school in LA non-temporarily, and then serving him.

The entire serving scene was there to show you how their split went from open and civil to messy and frustrating in a snap.

You should notice the trend of her not wanting to communicate the important things to him before they get too far gone. A nice parallel to the first scene in the movie where she refuses to communicate her feelings to him with the couple therapist, and following scene where she asks him for his notes and instead of saying what she felt she just walked to her bedroom and cried to herself.",e6l8bc

She was also 19/20 when they met, you ARE indecisive at that age. The beginning montage is a display of her list, which is, of course, only about the good in their marriage. There are always happy bits even in the unhappiest of relationships. 

She does say that she repeatedly brought up LA to be shot down, and that Charlie mocked her pilot before suggesting she use the money for his company. That was simply the final straw. I see their marriage as a decade of Nicole putting their relationship before her personal desires (which is the opposite of what Charlie has done), and the divorce as her stopping.

I think that cursing at your child is a bad thing and, while I'm sure great parents curse at their children - we're all human - it was another example of him being ill-equipped to deal with his emotions (e.g. punching a hole in the wall, wishing she would die), and taking them out on his son.

>If she was more upfront then maybe they wouldn't've gotten divorce. 

She was. She talks about the move all the time and doing stuff like directing but he shoots it down everytime. The whole thing starts when she gets the pilot and he just laughs instead of supporting her.

>She wasn't even willing to do the mediation in the beginning

Because she thinks the whole thing is a set up where they're just going to tell her how wrong she was. Also it wasn't marriage counselling, it was mediation going forward to a divorce. Now that the relationship is over, she has no reason to 'work it out'

>Instead of letting him know she wanted to get lawyers involved she just did it without warning.

There is literally a scene where she sees that her colleague has a professional working relationship with her ex husband and she asks about it which is why she got a lawyer.

Also, had he stuck with his first lawyer, he would have been in the exact same situation he was in at the end of the film except they both would have been financially better off but he was angry and he wanted to win. 

One of the points of the movie is that the legal system is designed to have a winner and a loser. It's not designed to have both parties win or to present an outcome that's the best for everyone. Nobody wants to be a loser which is why we end up with good people who still love each other doing things to hurt each other.

>If she didn't want the relationship to be that way, then she should've spoke up and/or they should have never gotten married

Again she did speak up but she was always cut off.

Charlie is a brilliant and creative person but he's also an obsessive micro manager. Nicole says in the film that she knew this when they first met but, like a lot of people in real life relationships, thought that would change once they got together or once they got married.

>He was forced to compromise because she took his son to a different coast and then had her lawyer lie like the son lived there. He didn't do it for her, he did it for his son.

That's the thing. You shouldn't be forced to compromise in a relationship, you should be willing to and that's the foundation of any long term relationship.

The fact that Charlie compromises for what's left of his family is a huge step and a good thing. He's grown as a person and is no longer as self centred as he was. It's just too late for his relationship with his wife.

Also, you may notice that he tells his dad he doesn't like a lot of NYC things/people in the car, but later mentions in front of the investigator that he doesn't like certain classes anymore, showing that children can be that way - liking something and then disliking it in rapid succession.

ffafv51,"Sorry this is a late reply, but why are you assuming that Charlie was never going to move to LA. Not wanting to move to LA when your career is taking off (which is validated by his play going to Broadway and the genius grant) is not the same as closing the door on it forever. You're making it seem like Charlie knew he never wanted to live in LA and strung Nicole along. Is it not possible that he wasn't really sure, was open to moving to LA one day, but not at the time, and she got tired of waiting for him? The fact that he moves in the end shows that it wasn't him lying about considering it. People's wants and desires in life and relationships constantly change and evolve, there is no way Charlie could have said at the beginning of a 10 year marriage 'Hey just know that I will never ever move to LA so if that's important to you we should break up now, never get married or procreate.'",e6l8bc

My reading of that scene with her saying that ‚Äúthe system rewards bad behavior‚Äù was more her suddenly realizing what Nicole finds out later - Charlie had decided to hire his own version of Nora because he could see how unfair this process had been towards him thus far. Nora was acutely aware of the bad behavior she had already engaged in, and now realized that Charlie was going to fight fire with fire.

I think the LA issue could have been resolved without lawyers if Charlie had not felt so under attack by Nicole‚Äôs low blow of hiring an asshole attorney. If Nicole had hired a Bert type who could have helped Charlie in a sensitive and honest way to understand what it was that his wife wanted, I don‚Äôt think the street fight would have been necessary.

Charlie coming to visit as much as he can, participating in Halloween as shitty ghost or taking care of that busted gate are more 'grand' ways of showing he cares, but as was narrated these are their characters.

fatj8pr,"When I mentioned strong arming, I was more so talking about during the relationship (which in all honestly we don't see so it's speculation based on a biased account from both parties). 

I said that because their marriage worked when it worked because Nicole seemed like a submissive personality. She supported Charlie. In the same way, I think Mary Anna ended up doing when he cheated on Nicole. But if your partner keeps bringing something up? I just find it odd that you wouldnt be curious or pursue that need or desire. My dad (surprisingly considering he half listens to everyone else) knows everything about my mom. 

The movie reiterates that LA is home for Nicole. The were married there. They came there often. It doesnt act like moving in LA would be unfeaseable. Or that Nicole is silly for wanting it. 

But the movie does point out that Nicole wanted to leave LA. At least initially (but people can change?) As Charlie cries in his apartment during the (tbh anticlimactic) fight that was troped up in trailers. Idk it was very odd. I felt Charlie's bewilderment and Nicole's anger at the same time because I've been both parties. 

I agree that infidelity isn't cut and dry. Just because I feel very strongly about it doesnt mean I'll never cheat or that I should virtue signal on reddit. The circumstances do matter.

Where I don‚Äôt agree is the idea that he never did anything to make others happy. Echoing what I said above, he thought she was happy ‚Äúuntil she wasn‚Äôt‚Äù, so he had no idea he needed to change anything.

Not really, just have to make sure the film negative is scanned properly and cleanly and removed of grain as much as possible.

That being said, they also still value clarity and sharpness *a ton* in their image, and very clean film stock scanned at 4K and up looks absolutely stunning albeit with the imperfections of grain. It‚Äôs a very fascinating process and I believe looks great in modern day cinema.

Personally I‚Äôd pick digital over film any day of the week, but at the end of the day it‚Äôs just a capture format and if you feel it adds to your story, go ahead. For what it‚Äôs worth, I thought Marriage Story was shot digitally- I‚Äôve seen too many new films and series that have this filter and ‚Äúfeel‚Äù to it that is reminiscent of film but almost always turned out to be digital (looking at you *It‚Äôs The End of the Fucking World*) But like you said, celluloid is alive and well and isn‚Äôt going anywhere üëçüèæ",e6l8bc

She is certainly probably right that women can be held to a different standard, but her total lack of any objectivity in that scene really just showed how personal all of this was to her.

The 55/45 thing really underscored that for me, and was definitely when Nicole realized how horrible Nora was.

fi09o1d,"Late but I've only just watched marriage story. 

I agree. I liked joker, but I had this niggling resentment towards it. Phoenix was great, everything seemed great. But to me it had a feel of superiority. 

I studied film at uni and college, and in college I became the edgy cringelord who wouldn't watch a movie unless it was Korean, subtitles and had at least one David lynch esque surreal moment. 

That passed as I got older and realised I was a fucking wet wipe, but my dad, who tried to show an interest in my interests, felt alienated. 

Watching Joker, I felt like my dad. Something about it seemed too high brow. I know it's not, but it's just how I felt. I felt the same would be felt with marriage story, but it didn't. I felt like it was made to be seen at face value. You don't have to analyse every single frame you can just breathe it in and enjoy it.

He had genuine love for Nicole as well, but refused to move because he doubted her. It‚Äôs clear he thought her choice to become an actress was irrational - and looking from the outside it totally is. Uprooting everything just for a tiny shot at fame and success in LA completely disrupts the consistency of the family in NY. It‚Äôs very frustrating that Nicole waited so long to make this decision and selfishly brought down the whole family. I get that Charlie was selfish too in treating her like the supporting character to his story, but you have to consider that her odds of actually having success in Hollywood as a no name are slim to none, which justifies why he didn‚Äôt want to uproot the family for it and why he laughs it off.

This movie really hit home for me because my girlfriend is interviewing for vet school in another state, while I have a really successful job in our hometown right now. Watching Charlie‚Äôs actions have sorta affected my mindset on everything. To me, my gf‚Äôs choice to go to vet school is irrational. She‚Äôs moving away from all her family, leaving her dog behind, and going $150-200k into debt to become a vet. I feel like it‚Äôs a completely irrational choice, but I can‚Äôt tell her to not follow her dream. Part of the problem is that, if I follow her, I don‚Äôt want to get stuck in the Nicole role (and now Charlie role) as the supporting character to her story.

fc55owr,"I agree Charlie did things to make others happy, its just he just didnt do anything to make others happy that made him unhappy at the same time. 

He liked his theatre family, he liked NY, he liked his career, his NY home and his NY family. There was no self sacrifice or self denial involved here. He was incapable of seeing that everything was working smoothly and making him happy because Nicole was giving up part of what she really wanted to do and he might have to do the same down the road like when he was given a chance to work in LA or when she was given the pilot.

Growing up in a disfunctional family where no one cares for you and you learn to care about no one but yourself may be a big part of the problem. He was incapable of reciprocating because he didn‚Äôt think someone was doing something for him in the first place. Thats why the accusation ‚Äúyou are so selfish you don‚Äôt even identify your own selfishness and selfishness anymore‚Äù is so on point. 

And Nicole did express her needs and wants during the marriage, her fault was not pursuing them agressively enough because Charlie‚Äôs way of getting his way was avoiding conflict and carrying on. Selectively hearing what was convenient to his own happiness and letting time go by was something that stopped working as soon as Nicole filed for divorce and could use custody and money as leverage.

It has to be his way or not at all.

>I called it mediation. I think they should've gotten divorce and maybe...just maybe if she gave mediation a shot in the beginning they would have been better off.

It wouldn't have worked because then Charlie would still have been a self centred narcissist. He has a whole character arc in the film and grows as a person because of it.

>One person got everything that they wanted at the end and the other had to throw away everything to be near their son.

Did you actually watch the film because neither of them got what they wanted. They literally say this when they have that big fight and breakdown.

There's also the last scene where Charlie announces he's moving to LA and the camera focuses on Nicole and her response. He even asks if she's ok because she's clearly not but this is something that she'll need to accept. Charlie goes through the same thing when he finds his kid reading the letter and he realises what he has lost.

None of them, except for the lawyers, live happily ever after but they make do with what they have and grow and learn from it.

>Charlie may have been into his work but the movie made it obvious how much his son meant to him...there was no growth. He did what he had to do.

I have no idea how anyone can watch this and this is the takeaway. Charlie, the stand in for the director of this film, grows heaps and bounds.

We can see an entire year later she created a whole relationship, which is great, but from how they act with each other they've known each other for while, so I am guessing shortly after the divorce, she drowned herself into another man, which is exactly what Charlie said she would do. Again, in a decade she's gonna breakdown again. That's the type of person she is. LOOK AT THE MOTHER.

> . And it doesn't exactly serve your love is blind argument if their relationship breaks down when Nicole grows as a person, hm?

Again, you are incredibly biased it's kind of insane, you are being very, very stubborn and failing to see Nicole is equally not growing as much as Charlie... I really cannot see a single point of view where you think she grows. In fact, quite the opposite is happening. She is doing the cycle again. She did it with the fiance, she did it with Charlie, and odds are, she's doing it with the new guy.

> lmost like Charlie used her ""flaws"" to serve his purposes. 

Yes.. unintentionally... like I said... and I despise that you use ""flaws"" like this because they are obvious flaws, you are increidibly biased towards Nicole and hold her up to this high standard when she is just as bad as Charlie.

> Their relationship required her to be a bit of a doormat. That's not okay.

Again, yes, I EXPLAINED this many times. Of course it's not okay, but lol, she's also an adult. She isn't 16, she can make her own choices, which is quite hypocritical of you to think shes this independent person but when it comes to your argument against Charlie, she isn't.

Nicole wanted to stay married. As the audience, we know this because she literally says this several times especially at her most vulnerable moment.

I don't know if you have Netflix but go watch the last scene again when Charlie goes to visit Nicole or when Alan Ada's character talks about divorce. Nobody wins.

>Do you think Nicole was even a little bit in the wrong when it came to how she handled the divorce or do you think she did everything perfectly?

Nobody should think this.

Nicole was objectively terrible during the divorce but the film makes it clear that she didn't start out that way. She had the best of intentions for her, Charlie and their son but she got caught up in the legal system and the ten years of emotional baggage and bitterness she was harbouring.

Part of her story is learning that she doesn't have to get back at Charlie, she can just let it go and move forward which she does.


>We watched the same movie, you just favor Nicole

The point isn't to favour one person over another. They're different people with different experiences.

You are suppose to watch the movie and see how the brilliant but flawed director drove away his wife, got wounded in the process but came out a better person for it at the end. That's Charlie's story. Again, it's no secret that this is based on Baumbach's own personal experiences.",e6l8bc

Being self interested in a divorce doesn't make you a bad guy, and it's really not clear to me that she's only looking out for herself  - she seems to be much more concerned about Henry's well being than Charlie is. There's not a protagonist and antagonist here - there are two people, both trying to do what's best for themselves in the most civil way they know how to do, and sometimes being pushed by their lawyers, who lack their scruples.

It's clear that monetarily the divorce favors the woman, but you are making the assertion that custody goes to even unfit mothers. You have nothing to back up that claim, as you have no data about unfit mothers.",e6l8bc
fc6g0jv,"Nah man. The kid isn't avoiding him because he was bribed, he's avoiding him because Charlie is a manifestation and personification of the divorce and bad emotions to the kid. It doesn't help that none of his past meetings with his dad were any good, and Charlie didn't really care about what his son wanted in them.

Charlie certainly tries to be a good father but that's not what he's being evaluated on. He's being judged by that one evening. 

And at the end of the day 45/55 is more symbolic than anything.",e6l8bc
fckxb3l,"Nope.  Halloween was around the time she moved to LA, before she even had a job yet in anything but a pilot. Suddenly, she's a director????  Oh come on!",e6l8bc
fcn6q03,"Fine.  I did watch it and like I said, it bored me.  Worse than that, it irritated me.

You can read all the messaging in the movie you like but it didn't ring true for me nor was it very interesting.",e6l8bc
fai4x0a,"You're welcome to stop too. Hey, guess what, during this whole exchange, I never made a comment about you as a person, never cared who you are, only talked about the characters. On the other hand, you cannot stand someone else expressing different opinions, leading to you making unfounded speculations on me and ad hominem attacks. Who is more unpleasant?",e6l8bc
fftv3ro,"Time out. Not about you. What did SHE lose? At the end she is in the job she didnt even known she wanted, in LA, has the kid, has a new boyfriend who gets along with the mom just as much. So what did she lose?

He lost everything. Remember too that they are both competitive people. So to him he lost everything and he lost to her.

Edit: sorry it sent 3 times.",e6l8bc

Look at the sexism dripping from this article, ignoring any sort of reason that statistical anomaly‚Äôs might exist:

fc6gblz,"Charlie IS a good father. Not tried to be. 

He‚Äôs a manifestation of the divorce because the MOTHER took him from his home and his father across the country and gives him tons of toys and always does fun things with him. She also consistently shuts him out of fun things like Halloween. 

At the end of the day NORA is a cunt who went behind her clients back for her own sake, not her clients or the child.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want him to be able to say to his friends he got 50/50‚Äù

-Cunt.",e6l8bc
fckyrm5,"Your time line is incorrect. Were you on your phone while watching the movie?

She moved to LA. Got cast on the show. Met Nora the lawyer, Charlie met the asshole lawyer and then went back to NY. He waited a month, came back to LA on the last day, hired the nice lawyer AND THEN the first halloween happened. 

I just checked on Netflix. [Check yourself or read the synopsis. ](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt7653254/synopsis). I don't care if you like the show or not but so much of your complaints are factually incorrect about what happened in the movie. You should give it another go.",e6l8bc
ffwrpj7,"She was totally the bad guy. There's never an attempt shown from her to make Charlie understand how she feels, she is petty in multiple ways, vindictive, basically castrates his ability to parent by spoiling the kid. She's the one who left, and by the sounds of it left a year before the divorce. She sucks.",e6l8bc
fc67jrc,I'm not saying there isn't sexism in family court. You are asserting UNFIT mothers are given privilege over the father in large numbers. Even with those articles you don't have anything to back up the claim. You would need to be able to show that a significant amount of mothers who gained custody were unfit or later declared so. The film did a fine job of showing that the system is built to automatically protect the mother. You're throwing out the term unfit and still don't have anything to back that up.,e6l8bc
fc6h5uv,"He's not a good father during the divorce, and that's really the only time we see him. The fact that the mother is shitty to him doesn't excuse that. 

Nora is winning and protecting her own livelyhood. Doesn't make her a cunt imho",e6l8bc
fclfel6,"Honestly, I quit paying close attention because all the talking bored me to death, not to mention all the constant references to how ""brilliant"" and ""special"" these people were.

Why was Charlie's lawyer any more of an asshole than Nora?  I didn't see that.  Charlie had a shitty case to begin with (I yelled at the TV when he let her leave NYC with the kid in the first place.)  Nora certainly had her own agenda.",e6l8bc
ffwsk1v,"Exactly. 

It was kind of explained that he was the bad guy in the relationship and she is the bad guy in the divorce. 

I think that makes sense a bit. However I agree with you that from what we see she was not willing to work with him on this. Even during the counseling she refuses to read what she liked about him. It was so personal that it made him tear up. Maybe that would have or could have changed everything.

Still a very good movie and she isnt a monster but she is the bad guy.",e6l8bc
fc686bl,Oh my god. My point is that the bias towards women protects unfit mothers. A father has to prove unfit in a process much harder than the other way around.,e6l8bc
fc6hnfr,"She went behind her clients back. To change the settlement. Without informing her client prior, for her own pride. that‚Äôs literally an offense that can get you disbarred. She‚Äôs a CUNT.

He‚Äôs literally the best he possibly can be. What would have made him a ‚Äúgood‚Äù father in your ignorant eyes? Quitting his job and moving to LA? How was he supposed to do anything more than he was doing? While his rich wife partnered with a huge attorney and bullied him for everything. Threatening full custody on no grounds.

Who the FUCK are YOU to say he wasn‚Äôt a good father. Jesus fuck that pisses me off so fucking much. Assholes like you sitting on whatever fucking tower you have shoved up your ass judging a man doing his best while his entire life crumbles around him fighting for HIS son. Nora‚Äôs a CUNT and so are you for defending herZ",e6l8bc
fcn6cdk,Why go on this annoying rant if you quit paying attention?,e6l8bc
fc68nmt,"Most would not disagree that the system is slanted for women in divorce. I'm saying you simply don't have enough back your assertion about unfit mothers. You also aluded to Nicole being an unfit mother, so you're perspective on who exactly is deemed unfit is also questionable.",e6l8bc
fc6mllh,"She couldn't have gone behind Nicole's back. She's not judge jury and executioner, She still needs approval from the judge and sign off from Nicole. 

What could he have done to be a better father? Honestly, I struggle with the question of what my father could have done. Sometimes in life you just lose; But Bert's advice was probably best. I think if I had to come up with something, I'd say interact with his child as a fucking human being and not a prop in his battle with his wife, for one - take his desires into account instead of doing whatever he wanted would be nice, too. There's not a single decent conversation between him and Henry throughout the film. Charlie didn't care about his kid - he cared about winning vs Nicole (and vice versa, she's also a pretty terrible mom, she just had good coaching from Nora)",e6l8bc
fcn6l6x,Why reply to me if my opinions are annoying?,e6l8bc
fc6aiya,"No. I said that even the admitted drug user got an unfair settlement. Not that she was unfit.

fc6pvht,"I‚Äôm sorry. You‚Äôre defending incredibly shitty behavior. 

And declaring that Charlie was a bad father is the stupidest thing I‚Äôve read.

Also Nora did go behind Nicole‚Äôs back. That‚Äôs what kitchen scene is about. After Nicole‚Äôs signed off she changed the deal.",e6l8bc
fc6qnyh,"In my opinion the Jedi are evil.

Noras just doing her job, which is to support Nicole and win the case. Is she an asshole for asking for the extra 5%? Sure. But she's not the devil, and it's a hole Charlie dig for himself. He had the 50/50 deal, he chose to throw it out.

Likewise Charlie's a pretty okay Dad, but you're making out like he's the best thing since sliced cheese and he's not that great. Personally I think there wasnt anything he could have done after wasting the first month, and he got stuck with the shit end of the stick, but that also wasn't Nora's fault. There are no good or bad guys in this movie.",e6l8bc
fc6qvl1,"There DEFINITELY IS A BAD GUY. And it‚Äôs NORA THE FUCKING CUNT.

Nora was the reason he got the second lawyer",e6l8bc
fciphx6,"We don't know whether he was - but there's a scene where Nora coaches Nicole and there ain't a similar one for Charlie.

The reason he got the second lawyer was because he thought he could get a better deal than the one reached by Bert.",e6l8bc
fciqh42,Because Nora was being a cunt and not budging on anything.,e6l8bc
fcisy5k,"That's literally her job, and it's what her client wanted, and it's basically the informal deal they came to anyway. She didn't ask for any money and split the custody 50|50. They never discussed where she'd live after the divorce, but it's no more fair that the kid live in NY or LA, and arguably makes more sense to be where the rest of his relatives live.",e6l8bc
