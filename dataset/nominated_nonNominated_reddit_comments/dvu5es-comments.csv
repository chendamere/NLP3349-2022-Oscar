f7eoooa,Please note this film is known as *Le Mans '66* in many non-domestic markets.,dvu5es
f7jxvac,An unforgettable moment in the movie for me was when Ford was crying after the ride with Shelby. We were led to believe that the ride scared the crap out of Ford.... Until he revealed the thought about his dad. Very touching. I loved the film.,dvu5es
f7jvun2,I would happily pay the cost of a movie to just watch Christian Bale chirp at other drivers in various moods as he passes them.,dvu5es
f7jyy61,"I know that everybody talks about the acting of Damon and Bale but man... Jon Bernthal is just awesome.

Seeing this movie without knowing the real story made this experience a lot better 8.5/10",dvu5es
f7kbyfv,"I’ve known about the Ford and Ferrari rivalry for a long time now and it always confused me why it took Hollywood so long to make a movie about it. But after seeing it tonight, I totally get why this story was in development hell.

The Ford Motor Company does not come out looking good. In addition to being the chief antagonists of the film, their production line of cars were mocked and ridiculed. On top of that, the executives are portrayed as automotive-nincompoops and corporate sellouts. Why would they go out of there way to support this film?

Also, I did NOT expect that many Ford GT40s. Even if half of those were CGI, all the racing scenes must have cost a fortune.

Finally, it takes such a competent director to make a 24 hour marathon race seem exciting. But James Mangold really made it work. I always pictured this story has a TNT miniseries, but Mangold made it into a blockbuster!",dvu5es
f7jwp9x,Bale's performance is absolutely great. But Josh Lucas? He sure knows how to pull off a very convincing a-hole.,dvu5es
f7khxeh,"After watching Christian Bale scream in British for 2.5 hours, i can confirm that I too, am now also British",dvu5es

f7kawgh,"Bale is magic every time he’s in a scene

The man just commands the screen like few else ever have before",dvu5es
f7kdrtk,"Never seen a movie that makes you want and not want a Ford so much lol.

Actually it just makes me want a Shelby cobra, but who the fuck doesn’t?",dvu5es
f7k7g7n,"WATCH IT IN AMC DOLBY!

Not every movie takes advantage of the improved sound system but this one sure did. You will feel it, snd it will feel good.",dvu5es
f7ko9mh,"Passing Luigi death stare, the movie.",dvu5es
f7jw7nz,"The ending of this movie gave me Stage II depression.

First they gotta hit me with him taking second by a technicality, then he dies while his son watches? And Shelby talking to Peter at the end sealed in all the feelings.

What a movie. Struck an amazing balance between the pure adrenaline of the race, the curiosity of the steps they take to make the car, and the great moments between the principal cast.",dvu5es
f7wpls7,"Miles looking in his rear view mirror and seeing nobody even close to him was a beautiful moment, recognizing he actually accomplished what he set to achieve.",dvu5es
f7k1qa5,"As someone who knows (and cares) embarrassingly little about cars, I honestly thought that going to this movie would be a 2.5hour long favour to my bf. However I can truly say I loved it. It was really moving, despite the fact that I wasn’t expecting the ending. I also thought the acting was awesome and I felt for every character. All in all, it definitely didn’t feel like 2.5 hours.",dvu5es
f7o2x6o,"Ken Miles: I'm in Shelby's car. Vroom vroom. 

The suits at Ford: Get out me car!",dvu5es
f7jv70a,"Props to the screenwriters because I don’t think I could have ever adapted this movie responsibly. I would’ve taken way too much creative license and written a scene at the end where Miles and Shelby beat the shit out of Leo Beebe.

Easily the most punchable character I’ve seen in 2019. Fuck that guy. Hats off to Josh Lucas.",dvu5es
f7n41uk,"Holy crap be careful leaving the Theater some people drive straight stupid after this film.

Anyway I loved this movie and might be my favorite of the year. Damon and Bale were out standing. The race scenes had me at edge of my seat. The ending tho :(",dvu5es
f7nlhf4,Was anyone else who was unfamiliar with the story sure that Miles was going to die at LeMans after Phil hammered the door shut?,dvu5es
f7ko27b,"Never before has a movie given off more dad vibes than this one

10/10 would watch with my son and ruffle his hair",dvu5es
f7q71j0,"Loved it and didn't really expect to. My favorite shot is kind of dumb, but it's when Miles was left in the Shelby garage after the whole team went to France. It's night, and there's a plane taxiing in front of a car carrier with a Ford racecar on top. Bale is silent, watching the plane, and the light from the taxiing silhouettes the racecar on the carrier so the shadow looks like a car is slowly moving on the wall of the hangar above Miles' head. It felt like one of the few ""quiet"" moments of the film and I just really liked the set up.",dvu5es
f7lg62f,"There’s a nice subtle moment in the movie that people may or may not have caught. In the fight scene, there’s a point where Shelby grabs a jar as Miles is on top of him, you can tell that Shelby realizes this because he ungrips the jar and immediately goes for the Wonder Bread instead. Its quick so you might not have seen it, but if you did, I thought that was an amazing moment to help convey the respect and mutual friendship they had for each other.",dvu5es
f7juqiv,How many people can play sleezy better than Josh Lucas?,dvu5es
f7lghvy,"Would anyone be willing to let me know if there are any crash sequences that involve flames? 

My BF is an automotive / commercial truck technician and walking vehicle encyclopedia but has some issues watching crash scenes that contain fire due to the untimely death of a friend in a fiery crash. 

We would love to see it in theatres but are concerned; we couldn’t see Rush in theatres for that reason. Thanks!!",dvu5es
f7jvi7n,"Enzo Ferrari really went in hard on Ford lol

“Sons of whores”",dvu5es
fb9z5cf,"Interesting fact, they changed Christian Bale’s character’s name from Ken Kilometers to Ken Miles in order to appeal to the American market.",dvu5es
f7jwdu3,"I was a little hesitant to see this because of the runtime, and could just picture those slow, dragging moments in a movie like this.

But that moment never came, and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute. Amazing how I was cheering for Ford to win while also wanting to see the smiles wiped off the faces of those execs. Also, I saw it in Dolby and the sound was phenomenal, I could feel the chairs shaking during certain scenes. 

Thank god I only live a couple minutes from the theater, because if I was hitting the highway after that...",dvu5es
f7kjpyt,"Surprised by how much dialog in italian had no subtitles. 
Shame, you non-pizza speakers will lose a lot of brilliant moments.",dvu5es
f7viqso,"I really liked this film!

I liked the film for many reasons, but it was also just really cool to see a Brummie (person from Birmingham, England) played in a Hollywood film, and Christian Bale's Brummie accent was really good (although his wife's was touch and go). I'm a Brummie and there were several times Bale's character said actual Brummie words/phrases. Unfortunately I can only remember two:

He told someone ""Don't take me round the Wrekin"". The Wrekin is a pretty well-known hill in Shropshire (near Birmingham), and the phrase ""don't take me round the Wrekin"" means (in this context) ""Don't beat around the bush"", or ""Give it to me straight"".

He also says at one point, something like ""I've got time to get a ham and cheese cob"" or something similar. There are many words used to describe a bread roll in Britain (cob, bap, roll, barm, bun), and which word you use is indicative of which region of Britain you are from. It is often the subject of (light-hearted) debate in Britain. In the film, he uses the word ""cob"", which is most commonly used in the West Midlands (the county which Birmingham is in).

Just a little Birmingham related trivia for anyone who's interested! I saw a couple of comments in this thread that stated they thought the accent he was doing was Cockney, so I thought I'd clear things up for any non-Brits out there! It was a very distinct, and pretty damn accurate Birmingham accent! :)",dvu5es
f7kbc8d,"After seeing this movie, I now want to see more movies about old school racing and drivers, Audi v Lancia at the 83 WRC, Jim Clark, Graham Hill, Ayrton Senna, Richard Petty, etc.",dvu5es
f7la61r,It's funny Bale was supposed to play Ferrari under Michael Mann's direction but ended up in the Ford team in this film. I still hope Mann makes Ferrari biopic with Bale.,dvu5es
f7pb12x,[deleted],dvu5es
f7jwh46,"WOW! What a ride!

This set must have been amazing from the gorgeous cars and detailed sets to the superstar cast who shine. FvF is a two and half hour movie that flows along nicely and doesn't feel long because you are invested in the journey of this group of people and this car. 

Sound design is smile inducing and deserves to be recognized come award season. 

Would gladly sit down to watch it again right now.",dvu5es
f7k0cmm,"If you are going into the movie without knowing the history and you want to know a little bit about it, I would suggest you to see [this](https://youtu.be/oXuqMt5aDes) excellent short documentary by James May for The Grand Tour.",dvu5es
f7kke3m,"I was worried that they'd depict Ford as the David of the situation, while in truth they were a Goliath with almost infinite resources, but they did a great job in establishing the overall picture and how powerful the guys in Michigan were.

Also, as a Ferrari enthusiast, I really liked how they portrayed Enzo: given it's character, it's difficult to capture his persona without making him look like a complete asshole, but I think they nailed it. He has the right balance of pride, smugness, love for racing and sense of respect that such a character should evoke. 
Loved the appearance of Gianni Agnelli, too: he was such an historical figure, and it was great to see him -although very briefly- on the big screen.

As a side note, yes, Ford went to Le Mans twice before winning ('64 and '65), and Miles was there in '65, but it's not a documentary, and it's a small change that I'm sure fellow petrolheads can forgive.",dvu5es
f7k1u89,"I don’t have anything unique to add. Just wanted to add another “I loved it” to the pile. Pacing was great, couldn’t believe almost 2.5 hours had passed when the credits rolled.",dvu5es
f7tj4xp,"Can we appreciate how bloody well John Bernthal played Lee Iacocca's role. That presentation to the execs, his mafia joke and specially ""Shit hit the Fangio"". I fucking lost it.",dvu5es
f838vfn,Christian Bale’s acting in that sequence as he silently decides to slow down...amazing.,dvu5es
f7k5byo,"most disappointing moment of the film:

there was no “my name is carroll shelby and performance is my business”",dvu5es
f7mq1ho,I don't watch much car racing irl. But I've seen Nascar and gifs of how fast pit stops are.  I was cracking up when during a stop he had time to call his wife.,dvu5es
f8s9xy6,More than half the movie was FORD V FORD not gonna lie,dvu5es
f7katy7,"Man, I **really** loved this movie. Almost flawless in my book. Breath of fresh air to have something interesting, fun, and entertaining after The Irishman :/

My only complaint is how it fell trap to the typical trope of OVER-explaining the plot via dialogue that feels unnatural or unnecessary. So many sport movies fall trap to this as they don't trust the audience enough to figure it out with context clues. They *really* overdid it during the final race.",dvu5es
f7leu9f,"If anyone wants to know the real story and how closely it relates to what happens in the film, I made a 30 minute comparison video breaking it down scene-by-scene and using real footage of Shelby and Miles to tell the story: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYVzwR\_RKCE&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYVzwR_RKCE&feature=youtu.be) There's probably more detail in here than you will ever need to know, but I would highly recommend A.J. Baime's book ""Go Like Hell"", which covers Ferrari's POV as well as Ford's, and I believe it was what the early draft of the screenplay was based upon.",dvu5es
f7kpbj8,Critics said it was a crowd pleaser and it pleased me immensely. And those cars looked and sounded really beautiful,dvu5es
f80rxpa,"I literally moaned out loud when they showed the Ferraris when they were touring the factory at the beginning. 

Genuine porn.",dvu5es
f7mygc1,Matt Damon’s hats deserve oscars,dvu5es
f7kjknc,"Just recently got out of the theater. The 3rd act was fantastic and all the race sequences are truly well made. I also love the chemistry between Damon and Bale. But I dont know why it feels like something is missing and I cant truly pinpoint what it was.  

It is surprising to also see that the Ford company was shown as not really the “hero” and I empathized  as well with the Ferrari driver which is weird because he didnt even say a word. Love the actor who portrayed Henry Ford though. 

All in all I enjoy it. It is a great crowdpleaser. The race sequences is where its at! Would love to see a Ferrari perspective too!",dvu5es
f7ud871,"I absolutely loved the movie. Here is my favorite Shelby story, I know it to be true because I was less than 10' from him when it happened. We were at Indy doing a TV commercial with AJ Foyt and Bobby Rahal, and Shelby was driving the Dodge Viper pace car that year. We were shooting the commercial in the pits when Shelby came roaring in with the Viper and he had a woman passenger with him. AJ Foyt was sitting on the pit wall and Carroll yelled over to him: ""Hey AJ what are you doing?"" AJ yells back: ""Shooting a commercial Shel."" He also asked how Shelby was feeling because this was not all that long after Shelby's first heart transplant. Shelby replies That he feels great and said: ""I have the heart of a 19year old."" Then he dumps the clutch on the Viper and yelled: ""The only problem is I've got the dick of a seventy-year-old."" Needless to say, we all cracked up.",dvu5es
f7jvrc6,"In my opinion this is easily the best movie in terms of sound design/mixing that I’ve seen this year. If you live near a theater that has a DOLBY screen, go see it on that screen. Sound is fucking amazing",dvu5es
f80f0rz,"I took my son, who is almost 4 and loves everything cars and vehicles and racing and the like, as kids do. 

He thought it was so cool, but about an hour in he whispered to me: “dad, the cars aren’t talking.”",dvu5es
fducxrb,"Thought it was an amazing movie, but man did I feel killed by the ending with his death.  I just wished the guy well, and he didn't win the race because of some total bullshit, but I figured well maybe they'll get it again next year!  Nope, he's fucking dead.  I feel so bad for the guy.  Glad the movie kept his memory alive.",dvu5es
f7qfgnv,"Holy hell did this movie whip an incredible amount of ass. 

The cinematography was gorgeous and emulated everything of that era. Bale & Damon shined & hot damn were those racing scenes orgasmic!

All the stuff with suits and measuring out sticking it to the man or playing ball was great. Easily one of my faves of the year",dvu5es
f7k3urr,"[The real story for anyone interested, told by James May](https://youtu.be/oXuqMt5aDes)",dvu5es
f7l78c0,"Daytona was the best race, hell, even sequence",dvu5es
f7jyjr4,"Started a bit off with pacing but once they get screwed over by Fiat and Ferrari, it really picks up. I know Bale, Damon and even Josh Lucas are getting all the attention, but I gotta give it up for my boy Jon Bernthal. He really held his own against the rest of the cast. Hollywood really needs to cast him in more leading roles in big budget movies because he is a terrific actor. 

Overall, it never really felt like a 2.5hour movie and those racing sequences were some of the best I have ever seen, especially with the sound. It made me wanna overtake every car I saw on the way home. Bale is definitely getting nominated again for this",dvu5es
f9zg6yx,"I loved the movie but did anyone else feel like it should have ended with the two of them walking off together after the race, discussing the potential new upgrades to the car? I found the epilogue so unnecessary.",dvu5es
fgl8dne,Great movie. I'd be shocked if it doesn't pull a couple Oscars for editing. The sound editing was one of the best I've ever heard.,dvu5es
f7kbvxn,Just saw the movie. I really liked it. Damon and Bale were both excellent but what really stood out was the sound design. The movie sounded fantastic!,dvu5es
fetn1ly,"Loved the racing and sound! 
2 things that irked me: Leo seemed like a 'bad guy' characature antagonist, not believable.
I also didnt really get the wife speeding down the highway scene.
Seems it was added for script tension.",dvu5es
f7kaoph,"The movie was 10/10 just based on the engine sounds alone. The whole cinema was shaking, it was incredible. And those shots of the Ferrari and Ford running side by side...

I did feel it was quite biased though. The other Ford drivers were portrayed as lessers when they had just as great credentials, perhaps better. Bruce McLaren in particular was a fantastic driver and car developer, just like how Miles was portrayed like in the film, he built his own grand prix cars to race in Formula One.

 Likewise how Ferrari was portrayed as the villains. Ford mislead Enzo Ferrari about whether he had full control of the Ferrari race team or not, he only found out through reading the contract. He had every reason to throw the deal out the window based on that alone.",dvu5es
fj4ple0,"Hearing about this film as a concept, I thought it'd for sure suck, but it's surprisingly a blast. All of the main characters were great, kinda wish they utilised Jon Bernthal more. It's great technically with its sound effects and soundtrack that just make the races so exciting to watch. That along with the dialogue and Christian Bale's humorous performance makes this one of my favourites of 2019. The ending is pretty emotional too.",dvu5es
fkdkvlp,"Just watched it and loved it. It feels like lately we’ve been drowning in a sea of really niche and hard to follow films, and something as simple as this is refreshing as weird as that is to say. It’s just a simple and enjoyable movie, nothing too over the top, and to me that’s the biggest appeal it has. I don’t know a damn thing about cars and still heavily enjoyed this, great acting too.",dvu5es
f8utv6y,"Just dropping by to say I thought this film was very good and one I would recommend to everyone.

And... to Americans, Christian Bale's accent is incredibly accurate for the area Ken Miles was from - it's not quite Birmingham but it's very close and his accent totally reflected that. Which is a pretty impressive achievement on its own!",dvu5es
flq971l,"This is pure art, just lit. No aliens beaming down cars, no flying cars, no cars dropped from helicopters, just pure speed having you grit your teeth as Miles pushes the car right down its last and final breath and overtakes everyone including the other Ford driver. God damn fine piece of work they did on this movie. 

A lot of tension and dropped many facts along the way, showing how there rivalry was built between the two companies. How Miles got to go down as a legend all on 1 bet placed by Shelby on his own company. If there was a wishing star or comet out in the world, I would make 2 wishes : 

1) that this virus we are all suffering from goes away and everyone keep safe

2) They make more car movies like this. 

The music score were put in at the right moment and nothing orchestral, or too flashy it was just right. Just the right push, making you lean forward and actually say ""Faaaaaaaar out !! Go man!! "" , they nailed this, they nailed it. Its one of those movies you cant take your eyes off, you got to sit this one through, because every minute is worth it. 

R.I.P Miles.",dvu5es
f7n3ske,"If you want to see Christian Bale beat up Matt Damon with a loaf of Wonder Bread, this is your movie.",dvu5es
f7kgnzt,"The sound is worth the price of admission.
Incredible film.",dvu5es
f7qd0k9,"What this movie gets right that so many racing films get wrong is what happens in between the racing. So many filmmakers are just happy to show the race and people watching the race and then leave it at that. 

What makes Ford so great is that it takes all those annoying tropes and turns them on their heads at the end. Yes, Bale is completely over the top. Yes, that kid is annoying. Yes, that's the suffering housewife, Yes there are a lot of people standing around watching cars go around in circles, yes it is even overlong, but the emotion that gets dragged out of those archetypical characters is nothing less than a screenwriting miracle. 

So just for that, the film should get top marks. It isnt my favorite film of the year or anywhere near it but it is a good exercise in creating a blockbuster with heart.",dvu5es
f84fifi,"—“Your father was...”

Me: *sobs*",dvu5es
f9gjrbv,"I know this film isn't ""high cinema"" but this was easily one of the best films of this year. The reason is execution. They did...basically everything to near perfection. The only legitimate complaint I've seen is that they took some liberties with Josh Lucas' character, who isn't a massive jerk in real life supposedly.

I had a wonderful time watching a film that I had no interest nor knowledge in. I love this film.",dvu5es
fa3a2bj,"What this movie needed to really set it off would have been a training montage where  Damon and Bale were pushing the car to it's limits hauling tree stumps through the snow, and then you cut to the people at Ferrari injecting steroids into their car and see it wack a punching machine that displays a very threatening high number.",dvu5es
fdloxv0,"I just finished watching the film and I loved it. I've complained a lot in the past year that I feel like movies are getting too long. So many movies I've watched this year and felt afterwards ""It was good, but did it really need to be 2 hrs and 30 minutes long?""

Not this film. I feel like it flew by and I was never bored. 

It's interested how the movie is called *Ford v Ferrari* when the actual Henry Ford and Enzo Ferrari are smaller roles in the movie. Ferrari himself is barely in it. 

The movie is presented exclusively from the Ford side of things. It was weird, I rooted by the characters of Miles and Shelby but actually came to dislike Ford himself as the movie went on. I wanted them to win but somehow Ford and Beebe, his right hand man. They were the villains of the movie. I started to like Ferrari in comparison even though he barely said anything the whole movie. At least he gave Ken Miles a nod of respect at the end of the race since he was the real winner. 

Christian Bale was excellent as always. I really do think he is the best actor in the world right now. Matt Damon did a great job, but I don't think he really has a chance of getting a best actor nomination over Bale. 

This was probably the best movie I've seen starring Matt Damon since *The Martian*. Good to see him doing a better quality of movie. The whole cast was awesome. Josh Lucas was just so damn obnoxious as Leo Beebe. I'm not sure if that is how he was in real life, but he worked great as the foil to Miles and Shelby. 

I don't know a damn thing about racing either, but the racing scenes were really entertaining. I loved the scenes of Miles trash talking/doing commentary of the race while he is racing in it. 

After this and *Logan*, I can't wait to see what James Mangold does next.",dvu5es
fgb6pzj,"Watched movie not really expecting anything and I was actually blown away. It was an amazing movie surprisingly. However, is it me or the movie showed how Americans really played dirty (Matt Damon taking the stop watches, sabotaging Ferrari's team during Le Man) but also makes me see Ford as a dirty corporation robbing of Ken Miles his first place. I already hate Ford cars but this movie really made me hate them more for some reason. This might be an unpopular opinion but I'm still Team Ferrari all the way.",dvu5es
f7qf3dy,"If you’re ever in the LA area, make sure you go to the Peterson Automotive Museum. It is unbelievable.",dvu5es

fb5f6lh,"Something I wasn't at all expecting: when the ""7K+ GO LIKE HELL"" sign went up and Miles reacted to it, I had one of the most intense full-body goosebumps moments I've had in the theater in a long, long time. I just loved it. 

Solid flick overall. Bale in particular was fantastic, as usual.",dvu5es
f7k3fa8,"This was as good as it gets without being a Godfather level perfect movie.  You may not care for the subject(s) (racing or bromance) or the lack of diversity or the period or whatever.  But the craftsmanship, casting/performances and pacing here are all on point.  They made exactly what they set out to make.

I went in knowing nothing of the story or the run time.  I'm not a car guy but I like car movies.  This was a notch up from Rush.  I give this a 9 and Rush an 8.  Logan was an 8.  This is Mangold's best so far.  At the end the run time didn't bother me at all and I was thrilled at how good it had been when the credits rolled.  

The only thing I'll dock it for is that it takes a few scenes to find a groove.  Pacing wise, the best recent counter point I can think of to this is MI: Fallout, which straps you in and takes you for a ride without ever letting up.  FvF is just a little slow off the line.",dvu5es
fgckym9,Was bored so decided i'd watch this not expecting much.. I'm not into driving at all but this movie was fantastic! Damon and Bale are such fucking great actors.,dvu5es
ffg7hj6,"Thought this was really good, great performances all around, but I'm rather surprised how loved this is. I think compared to the other Best Picture contenders this is arguably the weakest and not near the top level ones. I also didn't quite feel the gut punch the last 10 minutes were meant to be. Was I sad? Yes. Was I tear jerked like I probably should've been like I was for others this year? No.

Not taking away that this was really good but I just don't rank this as highly as many of the BP nominees as well as ones that didn't even get nominated like Lighthouse, Uncut Gems, etc.",dvu5es

i5f42kl,"I god damn hate when movies add scenes that you almost know for sure never happened. Like when Ken Mile's wife risked both their lives over an issue that she never outright asked him about. Rather than say, ""I saw you leave last night with Mr Shelby, what was that about?"" she drove into traffic until he gave in and gave a pretty mediocre response. Fucking Hollywood",dvu5es
f7kq369,"Ford v Ferrari is basically the best car film ever made. Better even than Le Mans. Bale and Damon are amazing. The drama is perfectly paced. The dialog is accurate (look out for when Mat Damon explain to Ford exec why it’s not about speed, or when Bale explains to son how to treat the car throughout an endurance race).

And then there’s the driving! Best I’ve seen since Grand Prix. All real actors driving real cars. Very little CGI that I noticed, unlike Rush.

I hope you can find it on IMAX so you can hear the Shelbys and Ferraris!",dvu5es

Matt Damon and Christian Bale were great but I gotta give props to the actor that plays Henry Ford as he nailed the role of a powerful, intimidating business man perfectly. >!Henry Ford breaking down and crying saying that ""I wish my father was alive to see this!"" when Shelby takes him for a ride in the GT40 made ME want to tear up.!<


It's soooo refreshing to see a movie about racing that's actually about the racing and cars compared to some other franchise that shall not be named.


Also I wonder what Ferrari thinks of this film and the portrayal of Enzo Ferrari and the company in general. Ferrari is pretty strict with their name so I'd love to know what they think of it if they've seen it.",dvu5es

As for the biggest laughs the crowd really enjoyed when Matt Damon took over the piloting duties on the airplane, and when he takes Tracy Letts for a test drive.

I agree with the folks in here who say the movie flies by at an unbelievable clip. Probably the quickest 2.5 hours I can remember.

I'm expecting some big award nominations across the board. Everyone played their part to precision, especially Christian Bale. Seemed like he had the time of his life in this role.",dvu5es

Acting , cinematography and those racing scenes were so great that even a guy like me who have not heard of le mans before would love it this much. And Christian Bale,this guy just vanishes into whatever character you wanna put him into. And the opening and closing monologue, ""*there is a point at 7000 rpm...*"" literally gave me goosebumps!",dvu5es

f7pmn06,"I’ve read a lot of comments about the name. Here in Scotland it’s called Le Mans ‘66 which I feel is a more fitting title. I have to say, I really enjoyed the film. I’ve been waiting on this being released for a while & can’t say that I’m disappointed. I didn’t know anything about the story walking into the cinema. I felt the tension of the race, I laughed along with everyone else during the added moments of humour & I had tears in my eyes at the end. I think I’ll view this in the cinema again during its run.",dvu5es

fdlcpsp,"Good movie but some points definitely feel catered towards a bigger audience, some scenes and shots feel corny to me.

And I don't get how Miles won that first race with shelby, he slowly gains on the other ford driver because he's allowed to exceed 6000 RPM. What does the other driver do? Nothing. Still drives at 6000 RPM. Bruh, final lap you'd do anything to win no?

Maybe I missed something there but regardless, good movie but there definitely are some cheesy scenes that don't quite make sense.",dvu5es
hxb6uy8,"i thought it was a good film, as a mechanic and car guy there was some weird stuff that put me off, like this weird obsession with RPM, it got it so wrong, its not how it works at all, or like brakes overheating in the rain makes no sense, oh and another one is right at the end he is laps ahead apparently but somehow by letting his team catch up on that lap he lost? in reality he would still be laps ahead. these are details that only real car guys would catch so i cant blame them too much but it did put me off very slightly and thats why i rated it 7/10",dvu5es

ff5f0nq,"Man, aside from only one good scene (when Ford II goes for the drive), I thought this was pretty mediocre. I mean I suppose it's a good box-office movie meant to appeal to the masses, but it had too much of that standard popcorn flick/big studio shine to it that really prevented me from going all-in on this story and these characters. Moments like Miles' wife setting up the lawn chair to watch Ken and Shelby fight, the cartoonish level Josh Lucas villain... Just a tad too gimmicky and unrealistic. 5/10. I understand why a lot of people liked this, but it just wasn't as unique or grounded enough for me to really enjoy it.",dvu5es

f7wwl45,"When I walked out of this movie I thought it was a well-done, if cliched sports underdog story with some stellar performances. But the more I think about it, the more I like how it puts a pretty smart critique of corporate culture smashing individualism and generational wealth in there along with all the story beats of this kind of movie. Obviously, Miles loses Le Mans because he agrees to go along with some marketing push, limiting himself because he wants to just help the team. The ostensible villain of the movie (in America, at least, given the title) is Enzo Ferrari. But he isn't the villain at all. He's just someone dedicated to his art (so dedicated he bankrupts his company) and loses when the bigger company decides to crush him.

And I loved Tracey Letts' performance as Henry Ford II. The character postures and acts like a corporate titan but that moment in the car when he's crying shows he's just trying to prove to his father (and grandfather) that he can run the company. He didn't build the company or earn his way to the top, it's just some game so he doesn't look like daddy's boy to the other car owners. It's all just for show, like where Ferrari sits and watches the whole race Ford decides to helicopter out for a nice dinner.

The only sour note is Josh Lucas, who really overplays the moustache-twirling villain role. Some of the writing was clunky, sure, but it's a bit overdone and out of place in this movie.

I don't think it's hidden at all but it's a nice addition to what could have been a run of the mill underdog story.",dvu5es

Damon and Bale were incredible and so was Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II, the Ford execitives were corporate level greedy but not stereotypically villainish. Jon Bernthal had a good role.

 If I had to point out complaints then, the motives of the executive who was so anti Ken Miles are not fully explained, the relationship between Miles and his wife Molly is not well developed, but again minor nitpicks.

The sound effects made you feel as if you could have been right in the car with them or standing on the sidelines watching the race. Sometimes I forgot I was in a theater watching a movie. 

I think the acting from the entire cast was phenomenal. I was excited to see Christian Bale because he’s one of my favorite actors and I was not disappointed. I typically don’t enjoy Matt Damon (although I do love him in The Martian) because I feel like I’m just watching him or some other character he’s done in another movie but I was surprised by how great and real this performance was. I think Bale and Damon were the perfect choice for these characters and they were so great and magnetic in their scenes together.

The most poignant and significant scene for me was where he is explaining the “perfect line” to his son and you realize that he is not talking about racing, he is telling his son about life. For those interested, there is a great documentary about this race on Amazon Prime on a “Behind the Headlights” episode which fills in some of the details.",dvu5es

I laughed out loud at Shelby and Miles’s punch fight and cried a bit when his son watched him die. My favorite scene is when Henry Ford II cried tears of joy after being taken for a spin. The 3 Fords finish was something I didn’t know happened but I learned that was how McLaren won! I gotta start watching more Le Mans and not just F1.

And just like yesterday’s F1 race, 2 Ferraris crashed out... Pronto? S🅱️inalla.",dvu5es
f88dwcl,"Seen it three times now, twice on IMAX and once in UltraAVX. 

Plenty of comments here about the film overall. So my thoughts on the racing scenes only:

The very best racing sequence is the Christian Bale’s first race at Willow Springs. It’s the most raw and visceral with real cameras seemingly attached to real old cars. This race seems to be shot with absolutely minimal cgi - I didn’t notice any but there must be some applied if only to make the venue look as it did in the 60’s.

Following this up, the next race at Daytona is awesome thanks in large part to the music for me, plus the must-win higher stakes. 

And finally the Le Mans race seems to employ the most cgi with animated debris fields and some rather fast swooping camera moves. Clearly a lot of cgi work needed here to make the venue look old. Enjoyable, exciting even, but it cannot match the joy of that first outing at Willow Springs.",dvu5es

Several of them said, in near unison, “wow, that was a really great movie” in the same exact tone and drawl. It has been a while since I saw a movie so honed in on that specific demographic.

Competently made, not really for me, went to see it for the heck of it and bc of the cast and good reviews. The thrill of the central accomplishment was not lost on me, but the film was very long and kind of followed most of the beats I expected it to, and the crux of the plot is a pissing match between an old Italian guy and a schlubby auto heir. But I did laugh out loud at the decision to accurately depict a fight between two middle aged men. I think one punch connects and the rest of it is them flailing around on the ground heaving for air. Pretty good.",dvu5es
f7ms161,"Mangold is one of those guys who's been making fantastic movies for years, but I only started hearing his name in reference to them when he jumped into the X-franchise. Ford vs. Ferrari is no different, in fact, it might be his career-best.

I loved it, loved everything about it. I was particularly struck by how gorgeous it is, with its saturated palettes and visceral camera work. Those race sequences were amazing, I was never lost or bored, and the camerawork was amazing.

This might be my favorite movie of the year, at least so far.

Everything about this movie worked for me and Noah Jupe is someone to watch, the way he acted sometimes even just with his face was incredible. I can honestly say the scene with Jupe and Damon in the last few minutes made me tear up, didn’t expect a film about cars to have that impact on me. 


I think this could win a few oscars for cinematography cause the film looks gorgeous and was beautiful too look at, best picture, Director and a few nods for Damon Bale and maybe Jupe. 



James Mangold is such a talent.",dvu5es
f8wmcit,"Hey guys. Quick question. My father is a Ferrari fan, and I'd like to take him to see the movie. Are there enough scenes with Ferrari's? My fear is there will be too much Ford in it (it's not a bad thing). I don't want him to get bored. We're Italian, and it would make him happy if the film talks, and shows both Ford and Ferrari in an equal way. Thanks in advance.",dvu5es
f9j99pd,"Do I recall incorrectly or did they skip Le Mans 1965 altogether? We see Ford's first failure in 1964, then they proceed to win Daytona (1965 I suppose) and then they win Le Mans (1965? 1966? We didn't learn, I suppose it was 1965 in the film otherwise Ford's promise for a drive to Miles would be really stale). In reality Ford also failed in 1965, and in the end credits they indeed tell the actual story that Ford won in 1966 to 1969. I get that excluding one year makes for better storytelling, but as a motorsports fan who knew the real story it was pretty confusing.

Otherwise, I would say the movie was pretty accurate. My friends wouldn't believe that even the cheesy three way finish actually happened. Also didn't fall into the trap of excessive Hollywood cheesiness or too much crappy CGI, and Bale's and Damon's performances were solid. A 7/10 for me even as a demanding motorsports fan.",dvu5es

f7k025j,"I knew the story going in and was kind of half expecting to nitpick it apart because it's such a revered story for American racing on the international stage.  I was really surprised at how they took some of the minutia of auto racing, details of the decade, and stayed as true as possible to the story.

The sound was seriously amazing.  >!The scene where car 21 blows its engine on Mulsanne straight really built the tension with the straining sounds of the engine.!<

The dynamic between Bale and Damon as Miles and Shelby, respectively, was awesome.  The humor of the film really seemed to play with the legend of Carroll Shelby.  Bale seemed right at home playing ""the Bulldog"" with an explosive temper while still maintaining a sweet side.

Tracy Letts playing the straight-faced Henry Ford II really let's Damon be his most humorous, especially the >!""we got Enzo right where we want him"" scene!<

Jon Bernthal as Lee Iacocca worked well, I just wish we got to see more of him.

The movie really has enough human interest to it to entice the uninitiated to auto racing, and has more than enough car porn to interest the gearheads. The movie is also very predictable (it is after all very honest to the history) but it shows that when done well it can be a rewarding movie experience for the viewer.

Would totally watch again.",dvu5es

- The pacing was great; 2.5 hours flew by
- Great performances and chemistry by Christian Bale and Matt Damon
- The comedy scenes were well-timed and funny 
- The racing scenes were fantastic! Excellent production from cinematography to sound.
- Caitriona Balfe was great as Mollie. Hope to see her in more movies. 
- Always love seeing Jon Bernthal and Josh Lucas played the corporate asshole perfectly. 
- The ending of the movie is still in my mind because of the double-bummer with the race loss and death",dvu5es

I had been highly anticipating this movie seen I learned of it's production. It did not disappoint! The accuracy wasn't completely there in places but I didn't expect it to be. The Daytona race was the worst part in this regard. Overall the inaccuracies were vastly overshadowed by the pure enjoyment of it. I LOVED this movie. It spoke to my soul from the outset. The sound effects were amazing! I love how for the most part, they didn't add a lot of soundtrack over the sound of the racing. I wasn't sure how I would feel about Matt Damon as Shelby, but he done great. I had no doubts about Bale as Miles and he lived up to all expectations. It was a fantastic ride throughout and I don't think I have ever been so enthralled in a movie in a long time. Reality drifted away and I was there in the '60s with them the whole time. 9.8/10. Only marks off are for the historical inaccuracies. 

To add: I feel the movie isn't well titled as Ford v Ferrari.",dvu5es

The monologue was a great way to open and end the film. Btw, the chemistry and charisma were there. bale and damon always exude a lvl of charisma that you just admire.

Great choices also with Tracy Letts as Ford II,  Bernthal as Iacocca, and the radiant Caitriona Balfe as Miles' wife.

f8iklk6,"I have almost two reviews of this film. One as a massive motorsport nerd and one as a cinema-goer.

As a motorsport nerd; it's *pretty* good. Up there with other good motor-racing films (of which there are very few to be fair - Le Mans, Grand Prix, Rush). Sure there are some anachronisms like certain cars not from period in some scenes, and my pet-peeve from all motor-racing films is there: namely that apparently if you want to go faster than the other car, you press the throttle that bit harder and you sort of just, go faster; so they do the same; so you do it again. Really, really annoying. Or even worse, that you somehow change a gear *up* to accelerate away.  But it's loud and brash and beautifully shot, and the crux of the storyline is true. Not quite up there with Rush for me for its handling of the material, but solid.

As a cinema-goer it was fantastic; Hugely enjoyable, fun, riveting, and the sense of speed and sound is intoxicating. The cars are just gorgeous and so well filmed. Bale is his usual phenomenal self and Damon is great too. Some subtle performances from the supporting cast were also very good.

All in all 8/10 - would watch again.",dvu5es

Also, is it just me or has it been awhile since Matt Damon has had a big role like in this movie? Last thing I remember seeing him in (outside of his cameos in Deadpool 2 and Unsane)is The Martian.

One last question: why did that ASSHOLE corporate dude hate Miles so much? Did it all really start over the whole situation with the kid opening up the car and being told to stop? Not a huge complaint here or anything, I may have missed something. But holy crap I hated that guy so much - props to the actor for being so easy to root against.

This was a funnier movie than I thought it would be. Allusions to Talladega Nights aside. Snappy dialogue. Loved Shelby taking the Ferrari stop watches, then offering one up saying ""*they're Italian.*""

I will say the sound mixing was shocking. Did anybody else see this where the cars' scraping and backfiring were deafening? Like  they were obnoxiously loud and stood out abruptly. Not in a good way where they want to make you feel like you're experiencing the car because the engine revving, wind, tires, all that wasn't nearly as loud and mixed in properly.

Christian Bale's performance is one best of the year so far and deserves Oscar nomination. Bale embodies Ken Miles, and he is so in the role. 

Caitriona Balfe, as Moline Miles, is traffic, and she has excellent chemistry with Bale. Matt Damon is good, but not on the same level as Bale or Balfe's performances. 

I feel that Jon Bernthal was underutilized through half the movie. His character becomes forgotten when the plot moves on. A little is a bit more of him. 

The writing is excellent. It balances humor and drama well. An Exmaple is when Moline saw Ken leave with Carroll, and she wants him to confess where he was last night. She was driving cazy and that shit hilarious but still dramatic. 

My favorite moment is when Ken almost finishes line, but he slows down. I like how it was directed as it jumps cut from him to his rear mirror. The camera lingers in the closet, and he realized that going alone isn't great because you can't share it with anybody. 

In general, Ford V Ferrari is in my top 5 of the year. I love this movie.",dvu5es

f86il8w,"What a fucking great movie!! Everyone's acting was amazing

The ending made me really sad, fucking corporate greed took away a major accomplishment and happiness away from an outstanding person who made it all possible.

I have couple of questions for other knowledgeable people here

1) So at La Mans, if two people cross the finish line almost back to back (like they were 10m apart when the first one crossed the line) do they always go back and look at where they both started? Or it just happened in this particular instance? Seems super weird anyway

2) Did ken miles get famous right after the 66 Le Mans, despite coming in 2nd? I really hope he did.",dvu5es
f8a2ive,"This was a little bit of a funny one for me. Felt inconsistent, I suppose? Damon and Bale were great (particularly Bale's interactions with his family), some of the shots of the cars were beautiful, there were some genuinely funny moments like locking the marketing exec in the office, the Daytona race in particular felt gripping, and it didn't shy away from making the Ford side a flawed group or from showing the dangers of motorsport. That said:

* The shots of the cars weren't always that great. They frequently failed to capture a sense of speed and intensity during the races.

* I'm pretty sure every clip of Miles stomping on the throttle, the rev counter going from 6000 to 8000, and the speedo going from 200 to 220 was the same shot reused several times.

* What the fuck was that bit side by side with the Ferrari where they both keep reapplying a bit extra throttle to pull ahead as if they weren't really trying before?

* The whole 7000rpm speech felt pretty forced, like a cheap advert. Really set me back at the start of the film because it looked like the whole thing was about to turn in to a two hour Ford promotion.

* Were the Le Mans officials supposed to look *quite* that Nazi with the brown shirts and red armbands?",dvu5es

After about 30 minutes in I sat there thinking: I like this. Why? What is different here?
And I figured it out. This is real. This is the sound a car makes. A busted engine. Rattling metal. Slamming doors. Metal that bends and breaks. 

There might be some CGI, and I can’t imagine that all the sounds were real. But it sounded right. It was loud, it felt real and I loved it!",dvu5es

f7lwq6i,"I LOVED the movie, however I do have one somewhat serious gripe: we really need to get rid of the ""downshift to pass on a straight"" action technique we've been seeing since Fast and Furious movies (maybe from before, but that's where I feel it became prevalent).

Like, the cars are side-by-side or one right behind the other, on a straight, flat out throttle, then suddenly one of them shifts a gear and overtakes easily. That has to go.

I need to preface this with my being a proper gearhead with some track time and a good idea of how race cars and racing in general works, which I'm sure makes me the minority of the viewing audience, but that little move happens so much in the movie it came very close to ruining the on-track moments for me.

I guess it's the easiest way to portray that kind of on-track action to the audience but it's so far removed from reality that I was seriously irked by how often I saw it, especially considering how many other technical things they respected and/or got right.

Also some of the engine sounds (as glorious as they did sound) didn't really match what the car was doing.

That gripe aside, great performances, great storytelling, great characters, didn't feel like a 2.5 hour movie. I know my post is basically one big complaint but I truly did enjoy and appreciate every other moment. I just had hope this movie wouldn't have resorted to that so often.

Respect for actually mentioning the honeycomb right >!before Ken's crash!<.",dvu5es
f7n741b,"Has anyone talked about how off the scenes at Daytona are? I have never seen a movie make such little effort to show a setting for a major scene in the movie. The track used is NOTHING like Daytona. I think they use Auto Club Speedway in southern California to film this. Just so far off. The walls of the track are BLUE! Daytona has never had blue walls. They used 0 CGI on the actual track and grandstand to make it look like Daytona. It is just 2019 Auto Club Speedway. 

- The walls are blue
- The walls of the track are S.A.F.E.R. barriers which were not invented until the 1990s and not installed until the 2000's. 
- Front stretch infield has a wall going down pit road which Daytona has never had.
- Grandstands look nothing like Daytona grandstands at any point in history. 
- Stands behind pit road look nothing like anything that has been at Daytona
- Track itself is not like Daytona. Banking is much different and the tri-oval is completely different.
- There were no lights at Daytona until 1998. The cars would have had headlights. In the movie the track is well lit. In real life the track is very dark.  

You would think for a big budget movie they would make some effort to make it look like Daytona. They have some signs that say Daytona but besides that there is almost no effort. This is a major scene in the movie and is EXTREMELY inaccurate. This isn't some no name place they are trying to replicate. This is one of the most famous venues in sports.",dvu5es
f8mq9hu,"Let it be known that I know absolutely nothing about cars/racing.

What I really enjoyed about this movie was the chemistry between Damon and Bale, who both just *vanished* into their roles. I would not be surprised if they were both nominated for Oscars. Bale's line delivery was spot-on. Jon Bernthal as Lee Iacocca was also very good. I've enjoyed him since Daredevil, and I'm glad to see he's getting more and more work. I would have liked to see more of him in the movie. The scene where Enzo Ferrari is telling him exactly what he thinks of Ford (and the subsequent moment where he repeats Ferrari's words to Ford) is one of my favourite scenes in the movie.

The cinematography in this movie, like all of James Mangold's movies, is excellent. It's sharp and engaging without being too over the top and flashy. 

This movie never dragged or felt too long. It was a very quick two and a half hours. The previews before the movie felt longer than the actual movie itself. The one part I would say I did not enjoy as much was the ""villain"", Leo Beebe. I felt like he was out of place in certain parts and was almost too douchey.

Overall I'd give this about an 8.5/10. Well worth watching in the theatres with as loud of a speaker system as possible.",dvu5es

f7y714s,"Loved this movie. Is it a bit predictable and cliched? Yeah, but it's very competently made with great performances and race sequences. I'm not into cars and races, but the race scenes were exhilarating thanks to the great camera work and sound design. Makes me wish I saw this film at a Dolby Cinema for Dolby Atmos.

Christian Bale shines the most in this film(this was also like the first film I saw him in with his natural accent as oppose to his American one). I love when he plays eccentric characters like Patrick Bateman and his Oscar winning role in The Fighter. He seemed like had a ton of fun making the film. Because I didn't know about the story, I was sad to see Ken Miles die at the end especially he after completed his arc of learning to become more of a people person.

The Italians do seem to be rather villanized in the film, but then again Leo Beebe was much to have no absolutely reedemable feature. Seems the real villains in this film is corporate culture and bureacracy.

Like I said before I'm not racing and cars, but this movie made me respect the sport tremendously. I didn't realize how much car knowledge you need to be a superstar racer and it's not just a matter of knowing how to drive well. There's also the danger aspect with how one slip up can cost you your life whether it be from mechanical failure or losing focus for a little bit.

Christian Bale certainly shouldnt have had a rivalry with Ferrari. He should have hated Ford more if anything.

So much wasnt explained in this movie. We get the scene where Fors gives Shelby full control. Then we get a scene where he has to give him full control again...wtf?

I know nothing about cars or about races so I really didnt understand a lot of that stuff, which wasnt a deal breaker except for the end when I couldn't even hear why Bale didnt win at the end. I had to ask my friend.

My favorite part of the film hands down, is the plotting. The movie is plotted as a representation of the Le Mans racetrack. Each race of the movie is one of the turns on the Le Mans track, and the long straight away of the track is the year between the Le Mans races as they prepared the car. The starting line and finish line of the track was represented by Shelby sitting in his car having a near panic attack before he starts the car and let's the engine calm his breathing, film starts that way and ends that way.

fifm8tc,"The ending of the race actually involved two Fords in a ""dead heat."" It is also possible that Miles let up at the very end to get a length behind the first to spoil the dead heat. I've also heard that Beebe had a concern that since the Fords were still actually racing towards the end that an accident from pushing so hard could have taken out the whole team. His motivation may have been to prevent such an accident and use the opportunity for dead heat photo op.

Never a dull moment, the 2h30min runtime just cruises without any bumps in the road, Bale and Damon are a dynamic duo comprised of Batman and Batman, because they're both equally good, although Bale gets to shine more because he's behind the wheel and has a sparkling personality.

I pretty much laughed out loud for 70% of the film, which could easily be considered a comedy just as well and the Le Mans race had some fantastic cinematography during the night scenes and showed just how crazy you have to be to take part of something like that.

Original soundtrack and the playlist of songs were both excellent and made it feel just as old fashioned as the time it's set in, but also the way Mangold directed it, but what I found interesting is that the film works on another level.

It's very much like filmmaking, where you're told you have creative freedom and final cut, until you don't, because corporate lackeys and owners have other ideas on how to get to the end result and they screw with your project until it doesn't resemble what you had in mind in the first place, but you're still able to make something worthy out of it even against the odds.

After being so much fun for over 2 hours, having no idea about the actual people involved in the story, seeing Miles die was a bummer and reminded of italian tragicomedies from the 60's, like Il Sorpasso.

All in all, Mangold knocked another one out of the park and is just as reliable as a director like Ford Motor Company wanted to be.",dvu5es

For a two and a half hour movie I thought it did a great job of keeping you engaged. Honestly no complaints off the top of my head. 

I will admit, though, at the beginning (first half hour or so) I did feel as if they had too much going on at once, but seeing as how it sets up the rest of the movie it isn’t really an issue for me.

The whole movie I kept thinking Miles would get in a deadly crash, especially after showing us his son Peter quite distressed about the danger of it, but I completely got suckered into thinking the tone felt irrevocably happy toward the end. Ended up the only one in a packed theater crying.

Speaking of, I'm in Michigan, and in a theater packed full of people and families who drive Ford and live it due to the plants around here, I was amazed at how loudly everyone laughed when Ford was mocked, but still audibly rooting for Miles and Shelby.

Damon, Bernthal and Tracy Letts are good, too, but this movie is really the Ken Miles story, with Ford vs Ferrari being the backdrop. The story itself is quite faithful to reality ('Go Like Hell' is a great read, even for non-motor racing fans). The only real disappointment for me -- and it's a big one -- is that like most of Hollywood's attempts to capture the essence of racing on the big screen it falls a little flat. It's not just the occasionally patchy CGI, but how they chose to shoot the cars. At one point Shelby boasts to Ford that the GT40 is capable of well over 200 mph, but we never really see it, or more importantly, *feel* it. Instead we get a series quick cuts and same static shots of the drivers staring at each other as they pass. I noticed some of the old genuine TV footage inserted into the movie was sped-up as well. I can't decide what is more ridiculous -- that Miles always seems to forget he has another gear until the very last minute, or that he only pushes the accelerator flat-to-the-floor when he's reaching the end of a straight. It's those little details that are cardinal sins in the view of any racing fan. I don't get why they find it so difficult to find the inherent drama in racing -- at one point in the movie, Miles has to make up an *entire* lap on the leading Ferrari, which in reality is a HUGE challenge. It should have been his Ali/rope-a-dope moment, the centrepiece of the entire race, and yet its over in about thirty seconds of screen time.

Just a reminder to myself to see upcoming films on the biggest screen possible with the best sound.

My dad had a pretty good time - that was the best part. And he used to drive Porsche competitively back in the 80's so that's a big compliment, he said it was nice to actually hear some real V8's for once and see some real mechanical work - he liked that a lot of attention was put into the fact that anyone can put the pedal down and drive fast, but keeping it together and knowing how to maneuver it without it falling apart (especially in the 60's) is a whole different game.

The only thing I think is a bit strange is >!the ending. To me the entire movie was like a feel-good sunshine story from the beginning, from the happy sunlit visuals to the music and the friendships between the characters. They accomplished what they set out to do, they built the car, Miles drove it, and they won Le Mans. The technicality about him not actually winning is real-life bullshit, but Miles agrees it was never about the win, but about the drive instead, and we all know he could have won if he wanted to. !<

>!Thus, when the Miles and Shelby walk away from there, already thinking about the next race and the next improvement, that's when it should have ended for me, because that's what the story was about.

I don't know how much of the car racing was actual and how much was made with computers, but all of the races were spectacular. The night drive of the Le Mans, with the rain pouring down, I was on the edge of my seat. Those drivers have nerves of god damn steel for pushing their cars like that in those conditions.

My favourite scene and an example of amazing cinematography in this movie is when Ken is listening to the first 24h race on the radio.

With the added sound effects of the engines from the radio, the car shadows move across the wall like race cars.",dvu5es

Bale speaking in a British accent looks so damn fake to me, I've gotten used to his American accents that he falls into the alo guvnah valley for me.  Matt Damon also felt like he overacted a bit.  Actor who plays Ford the Second really made a character with depth. The Ferrari family was magic.  Last time I saw Caitriona Balfe was Money Monster, which was sadly meh, but she was amazing in that and here.  Kid was great.   and ofc the cars were the main draw of the movie and they were ridiculously good looking. and sounding, spring the extra bucks for a dolby atmos at the very least.

I vaguely remember watching a documentary about this event, luckily forgot enough details to be on the edge of my seat the whole race.  Like all biopics and based on true event type films, don't expect the full truth.  Movies are their own universes.",dvu5es

I thought all the performances were fantastic but I can't believe Bale's accent isn't getting more attention, he switches between Yorkshire and Brummie throughout the whole film. I was amazed to see his son wearing an Aston Villa strip near the end as I was convinced he was playing a Yorkshireman. That said I can't remember seeing Bale having so much fun playing a character since maybe American Hustle.",dvu5es

I really liked the characters, but I wasn't completely destroyed by Ken's death like I should have been, and I think it's because these guys are barely explored besides the base of their personalities. A fun thrill ride the whole way though. 4/5.",dvu5es

f85lfqe,"I really enjoyed the movie. Thought the production and set design was fantastic. I loved Matt Damon and Christian Bale, I thought they had a very intriguing relationship. There was respect, they were friends, but you could sense an uneasiness due to the power imbalance.

Having prior knowledge, I was wondering how they would handle Ken's death, and I'm not sure if that was handled exceptionally well. I think it might have been more powerful to cut to some real life footage after the Le Mans win/snub then have some text explaining what happened like they do at the end of some other dramatized documentary style films. However, my GF who wasn't prepared was devastated by it. So maybe it plays better to audience members who don't know what is coming.

Other than Lee Iacocca, I thought the rest of the characters were fairly weak though. They really tried to make Mollie a nuanced but supporting wife, but I didn't think she had enough dialogue or screen time to really make me believe it. She doesn't show enough concern for her husband catching fire during his first bad crash. She immediately says, well get onto fixing that. Only his son shows some realistic concern.

Henry Ford II was also a let down for me personally. To many times does he come out strongly against an idea, like in the projector fucking up scene, only then to be fairly easy persuaded to do what the audience already knows he is going to do.

Also, I think they rushed the attempt to buy Ferrari. I would have loved to see more corporate drama and politics around that deal and how they tried to screw over Ferrari.

Looking into it more now, there are definitely some unneeded historical inaccuracies, which is disappointing. But it still was an enjoyable theater experience and I'd recommend any car fans go watch it.",dvu5es
f86m14i,"Great sound engineering. I was in a regular theater and it felt loud enough that it felt like you were in the car. Also the plane going over you sounded like it was right there.

f8ap8q8,"The first 20 minutes or so are a little bit rocky. You hear Damon's accent and you wonder if you can handle it for two plus hours. Then you question whether you can buy-in to a movie that makes Ford the underdogs. And then you wonder what the hell Bale is doing. But, it all comes together. You get used to Bale, the focus on Shelby and Miles is strong, and Damon really knocks it out of the park. I think 20 years from now we'll look back at this movie as being the start of the second half of Damon's career. The movie itself is very tight. Everything serves a purpose, it's engaging throughout, and it's a lot of fun. Wouldn't call it a masterpiece of cinema, but it's definitely one of this years best and most enjoyable movies to watch.",dvu5es

It wan't perfect, I thought the ""bad corporate suits"" plot-line was a little too over-the-top, and the death at the end seemed to lack emotional punch.  Plus I wanted more out of Iaccoca.  But otherwise this was a pure joy to watch. All of the acting was terrific.  In spite of its length it never dragged or got dull, and I had a big grin on my face for the whole movie.  The fight scene between Shelby and Miles was absolutely hilarious.",dvu5es

ff274rv,"I rewatched the film and my initial reaction was negative due to the title being misleading, cause it is. But after a 2nd viewing, I think I took the film for granted. It offers some pretty interesting details that serve as educational. I’ll applaud any racing film with effort/attention to detail put into it. Hollywood has a problem with racing films and overall, this one was okay. Nothing extraordinary but a change of pace from the usual stereotypical racing movie tropes. Most of the racing scenes are well done even if they weren’t real- I don’t know if they were or not. The sound is great too.

But a few areas of issue. This film did improve on Hollywood’s stereotypical racing movie tropes, but not entirely. Like speeding up footage and bad CGI. They look terrible. Don’t speed shit up just to match the soundtrack. It’s noticeable. And the crash in lap 1 looked really bad. You knew it was CGI. And the helicopter take off looked bad too. Both looked like incomplete CGI. 

Also not a fan of revisionist history so I can’t agree with Hollywood dramatizing some details that clearly aren’t accurate. I was surprised with how they paid so close attention to multiple interesting details but portrayed a particular character so misleadingly. That’s weird. I don’t know why they implemented a clash with Ford’s Leo Beebe and Shelby/Miles at all if the film was to be titled “Ford v Ferrari” to begin with. It ended up being Ford vs Shelby/Miles. This was a Shelby/Miles movie more than anything.

But most of all, the title’s misleading. And it changed my entire view of the film. They shouldn’t have named it Ford v Ferrari.",dvu5es
f8mvht3,"I appreciate the level of talent that came together in an earnest attempt to make a high quality, middlebrow popcorn flick. But it just fell completely flat for me. The biggest problem I had was that it wants to be a classic underdog story, but that's hard to do when the underdog heroes have Ford backing them. I get that Ford had never made a real racing car, but this wasn't some ragtag group of ne'er-do-wells who were building a racing machine with nothing but determination and grit; they had one of the most successful automobile manufacturers in the history of the world backing them. 

I also felt no real drama in the design and building of the car. One second they've got a car that's all wrong, so they build a new engine, but the engine can't fit into the car they have. But in the very minute the audience learns that they need to re-design the whole car, the characters step outside to find out it's already been done! No real stakes, no real setbacks, and because there was no character acting as the surrogate for the audience, we never really learn anything about the Herculean task Shelby and his team had to take on. 

Some good performances and a couple of really great racing sequences, but just didn't do it for me.",dvu5es

f7kikfp,Now that I got home safe and with out a speeding ticket I will try to give an unbiased opinion. I though it was very well made in terms of cinematography and sound. Also the characters which had more than 5 minutes of screen time were also well developed. This can be seen by how much I hated the execs by the end of the movie. As well as the last scene with a new driver and disgust of not understanding the car. I though the cars were cool and not sure how they did it but made the 2.5 hours seem short and go by quick and fun. Movie was enjoyable to even my non gear head friends and they were talking about it on the way back home. This rarely happens and last movie to do this was Avengers. I did think some of the dialog was weak and a bit fancied up but in my opinion they made up for it with the relationship of Damon and Bale. I am definitely watching this again to catch more details. Also as a side note I was kinda happy they got a good portion of the racing lines and tactics right.,dvu5es
fb9xdqd,"I know jack about cars nor do I get car culture (but to each their own). I know nothing of the history - never heard of this race before. 
But I loved it. It absolutely enthralled me and won me into the stakes of the movie. For someone who has no knowledge coming in, I didn't feel lost or like I was out of my element thanks to exposition handled very well. Except once when Bale couldn't go to the first race in France. For a moment I thought it was the big race (and my thought was ""they fail, and now have a year to make it work"") but soon got it.
 Mangold put together a hell of a striking film in all manners. Damn that shot composition. The editing, the flow, the music, all came together.
Only real issue- no real character or development. But that's something I really didn't think about til afterwards thanks to the charismatic and chemistry-laden performances by Bale and Damon.
But all and all, it just worked.

f7mgyfj,"I loved it, 9/10 for me. It's 2 hours and 30 minutes long but it does not feel it at all. I really like the build up of it, especially Job Bernthal's character, and I loved to hate Leo Beeby. Bale and Damon are once again on top form, and honestly I see Damon getting the award nominations over his co-star, although I preferred Bale's very British insults. 

Very depressing at the end with Miles not only coming 2nd but then dying during a test. I was slumped in my chair when for the rest of the film I was on the edge of my seat. 

The entire cast was standout too with both CEOs being super well acted. I really liked the character moments Miles had with his wife in the garage and his son in the bedroom describing the track. My favourite scene though was Shelby taking Ford out for a spin, you really felt the car that time and made me want to go for a ride in one. It definitely had me revving my car when I left the cinema and maybe pushing it a little too hard for the 40 roads on the way home.

One last thing, when Bale is sitting in his car crying at the end, he looks so incredibly like the old man who portrayed the older version of Private Ryan over 20 years ago. They got it so right all those years ago, astounding.",dvu5es
f978dsp,I can't decide if I want Christian Bale or Matt Damon to win best actor more. Both well deserved.,dvu5es
f7kgk3n,"I'd give it a solid B overall. The action was fairly well done and the sounds were great, but the drama itself is pretty by the numbers with a few eye roll lines here and there to help along viewers who don't know anything about racing (I had a good chuckle when one of the pit crew guys shouted out ""white flag, one lap left!"") It's overall a totally competent movie but it's nobody's best performance ever or anything like that. At the very least, it inspired me to drive my FoST home like a total asshole after it let out.

One little nit I had to pick was that, while they did a really great job showing the speed of the car on the track, I felt like they didn't convey the G-forces that the drivers go through quite as well. There were a lot of moments when Miles was going around a corner or braking hard and the cut to the inside just looked like he was having a casual drive. I wanted to see him really sinking into the restraints and tensing up to brace himself. Similarly, Deuce should have been getting Deathproof-ed in his little ride-a-long.",dvu5es

f7vayac,"Okay, I have a problem apparently.  There must be something wrong with me because I thought this movie was torture.  

**Calm down, I'm not saying if you liked it you were wrong**, but I feel the need to speak up for folks like me.  

Biopics are by nature, required to adhere, at least predominantly to the true story.  This can be cumbersome as well as beneficial.   In this film, it was clearly cumbersome.  

I once had a pleasant conversation with Ron Shelton, the writer/director of Bull Durham, one of the great sports films of all time, and I asked him how one deals with the problem of *The Big Game*.  The big game, of course, refers to the fact the the climax of any movie about competition can only have three outcomes:  The hero wins, the hero loses, or in some cases the hero fails to compete (which one, could argue is the same as losing).  The problem is that the audience knows the ending will be one of those outcomes.   

Shelton's response was that: *""if the hero loses the game, he gets the girl and vice versa.""* 

Brilliantly simple.  

But, with biopics, we know in advance, so that device can't be employed.  What is needed then is to reward the audience for their time, with great character portrayal,
sparkling dialog and behind the scenes intrigue as to how the hero's skills and knowledge operate.    In Moneyball, we were treated to multiple scenes in which Billy Beane and his sidekick interacted and challenged the entrenched system they were trying to change.  Those scenes were memorable and believable.  When Billy wasn't at work, his relationship with his daughter was also compelling.   Having been an baseball fan since childhood, I was fully aware of the true story's outcome, but it didn't matter because I *cared about the heros*.  

Ford vs Ferarri was boring within minutes of the open credits.   While Damon's Shelby was at least respectable, Bale's Ken Miles was a cartoon a one-dimensional, riddled with angst, know-it-all, We don't know why he's that way but we were supposed to root for him?  His wife was a shameful male's depiction of a spouse who can only be either doting and sympathetic or whiney.  Worse was a scene in which she puts her and Miles life in deadly peril to prove her point.  Doting.  Whiney.  Crazy.  Nice work guys.  

His son looked like the favorite of the casting call but here, again, the writers simply did not know or care to bestow any real depth.   Boring. 

Damon's Shelby was sincere enough to warrant some attention but how did he get to be where he was?  Why didn't we learn more about him?  After all, he actually built cool cars that went really fast.  How did he do that?  What made his cars fast?  For that matter why didn't we get deeper into why these cars are special at all?  In Amadeus, a movie that was not about music, but rather a composer's relationship with his father, the filmmakers at least delivered some scenes where the audience can get a sense of what composing is.   

Tracy Lett's bigger-than-life Henry Ford II was a respite from the dull supporting staff, and the clear winning scene of the film is when he gets his chance to ride in the machine he allowed to be built.   Sadly, the rest of the Ford vs Shelby story plays like an 80's style corporate tale with executives who are limited to either kiss-assers or cheating ladder-climbers.  

The depiction of the Italians was even worse.  Full-on cartoon there. Emotional gesticulation with a dash of *sinestra* (Sinister comes from the word, left). Nevermind the fact that the Ferrari looked way cooler than the Ford, or the fact that they won the big race four years running, or that they continue to make cars that rich Americans covet in a way Ford will never enjoy.  

Good story telling is on display when the audience can't resist seeing what happens next.  I looked at my watch 40 minutes in.   The whole film felt as if it were created by the very same board-room suits as the film's antagonists.  It was made by men, for men.  There was no romance and virtually no humor.   

As with modern big-budget movies these days, the production was superb, with tight editing, bold sound design, and solid work by the DP.  But ultimately none of that matters if you don't care if the guy wins, loses or gets the girl.

Edit:  Typos.",dvu5es

f7kj2by,"Had a bit of a rough and uneven start and goes by the numbers for a while. You know..Damon's gum chewing, Bale's smug face, corporate execs, car jargon etc., but once Bale gets into the driver's seat it's once hell of a ride.

Has a couple of terrific race sequences but the film delves more into the men behind the wheel and their bosses than racing itself. Damon is the face of the film while Bale is the heart. Bale has the more interesting role out of the two. He delivered an excellent performance. Bale is a great actor in quieter moments than in the louder ones which he is famous for. He was best when he was alone in the car. He perfectly portrayed the number of emotions a driver feels behind the wheel. Perhaps the best race car driver performance I've seen.

Damon fought the corporate battle. Kind of an artist who has to put with the corporate execs. That he portrayed pretty well. He brought that movie star persona when he was delivering speeches. Jon Bernthal was Jon Bernthal, he looked like he had more to play but he didn't. Josh Lucas and Tracy Letts got more of a cartoon-ish roles and this is where the movie falls apart though Letts brought out fun from what he was given. He was surprisingly good. Caitriona Balfe and Noah Jupe were limited but all their scenes with Bale brought the necessary emotional weight to the film.

Visually the film's neatly shot but it's the roaring sound design that gets most applause. Kind of an eargasm for car enthusiasts. Editing is pretty smooth and tight too even if the movie clocks in at 150 min. Marco Beltrami's score shines in the quieter moments but couldn't keep up with racing scenes.",dvu5es

f8uow60,"I had written this movie off since the trailers dropped, given I have zero interest in racing. Ended up giving it a shot after a ton of people said how much they enjoyed it despite not being into cars... and I agree! I really enjoyed the movie overall.

I found the first 30 minutes or so to be a bit confusing and slow, as it set up the story and characters. I had some difficulty following who people were and how they knew each other. I was starting to get bored until the Ferrari acquisition part, I felt the movie really took off and it completely sucked me in. Racing scenes were as fantastic as everyone said. I'm an engineer and the part of the movie where they are iterating and testing out their design was extremely interesting to me, despite not having a particular interest in cars.

The relationship between Bale and Damon was my favorite aspect and really elevated the story past ""just a car film"". Their performances were extremely solid, and I thought Christian Bale was absolutely fantastic. I really loved the relationship between Bale and his family. The scenes between him and his wife were really sweet, and he gets some nice scenes with his son too.

What a doozy of an ending! I'm glad I didn't know what happened before watching. The movie was kind of old-fashioned, but didn't come with all the baggage that usually comes with that. I mean it's definitely still a very male-focused movie and the wife doesn't DO anything... but it honestly didn't bother me that much and I didn't feel like the movie had any bad intentions.

Solid 8/10. Rating would probably be higher if I was more into cars, but as it is I'm surprised I liked it as much as I did.",dvu5es
fa3yok5,"Does anyone know what the exact words were for the speech that Carroll Shelby made (in the movie) because it really spoke to me. It was something along the lines of, few people find what they have to do, and they cannot stand not doing what they were meant to do. It was after the part where Shelby landed the plane. If anyone happens to find it please let me know!",dvu5es

f7nb8ng,"I assume this was an embellishment on the writer’s part, (not knowing the actual history of the race maybe it did really happen) but I didn’t like how Shelby stole Ferrari’s stop watches and planted a nut to confuse Ferrari’s pit crew. It cheapens the effort from the Ford team. It’s unsportsmanlike and Shelby seemed like a man of integrity so it felt out of character. 

In fact, as likable as Shelby and Miles were, when you look at this movie from the Italian’s perspective Ford comes off quite villainous. They’re kind of like how most baseball teams view the Yankees. They have all the money in the world compared to you, so they buy their talent and keep throwing money at it until they get a winning team despite their shortsighted management. Whereas you scraped together something great through much smaller means. Then they resort to cheap, if not downright illegal, tricks like stealing your watches and planting fake car parts. And they bitch about a technicality at the end even though they took advantage of a technicality in the rule book that implies but doesn’t specify that you can’t change your breaks.

Not that that diminished my enjoyment of the movie really. I mean just because it’s called Ford v Ferrari doesn’t mean you have to look at it through the lens of Hero v Villain. (I think Josh Lucas gave the movie all the villain vibes it needed)

Fun movie, great performances all around. See it on a big screen with loud speakers cause the sound is just as important as the visuals in a movie like this if not more so.",dvu5es
f7pdfik,"Man, I can't believe I was worried this movie was going to end up just being a two hour Ford commercial. They should have called it Ken n Carroll vs Capitalism. There's infinitely more on-screen tension between them and the Ford executives than there is between Ford and Ferrari.

Overall I thought it was pretty good, though I felt like it was kind of lacking in overall character depth compared to a similar movie like Rush. I honestly never felt like there was an actual rivalry between Ford and Ferrari here outside of the opening scenes and during the final race. And in general I felt like there were a lot of scenes that could have led to much greater character depth, but they were either rushed through or glossed over entirely. But on the whole, the races were incredibly well produced, and those alone were worth the price of admission.",dvu5es

f7tdxw2,"The changes they made were pretty much what you'd expect to make it more cinematic. They really played up Ken Miles as an outsider underdog and the Ford executives as petty assholes.

I didn't get the end of the race.  When Leo came up with his idea for a 3-way tie, he was told that the other 2 Fords were down a couple of laps.  When Ken went back out, he went all out and continued to set records.  They didn't show it, but it's safe to assume that he picked up another lap or 2 during this time.

When he slowed down on the final lap, I thought he was compromising.  Give Leo his photo-op by crossing the line together, but still win because of the lap-lead.

Then we find out he got screwed out of his win because of the starting position rule.  Did I miss something?",dvu5es

The racing scenes were tense and awesome, but I just wish one movie would actually do racing properly! like the gear shifting and accelerating were not done right. he gears up and accelerates on turns and stuff when he should be gearing down and taking his foot off the gas.

1. When Caroll Shelby put that 7000 rpm sign up for Miles at Daytona, what does that mean in car terms? I know they were supposed to stay under 6000 Rpm but does the car get affected if you go higher?

f8a6e8q,"Overall I had the film at an 8.1/10. Biggest flaws were the directing and editing. The directing was *fine* but I think this could've been made significantly better (potential Best Picture candidate) with a different style of directing (Adam McKay without the cut-to narration?) Was it about the relationship between Shelby and Miles? Between Miles and his son? Between Miles and his love of the sport? I feel the film sort of floundered in poor direction throughout a majority of it, despite the fact that it had many opportunities to take a 'deep dive' into certain areas of the subplot.

It failed at showcasing the cars in a spectacular manner. I couldn't help but think that it was dying for some sort of montage set to some mid-60s music in that beautiful shop located in the hanger. For a film that was simply about racing and manufacturing incredible cars; there were only maybe 2-3 shots that I mentally noted as being great. The cinematography was well-done overall, but I just felt that when it came to how the cars were portrayed, they could've done a better job. 

Anyone else feel the casting was a little off as well? I thought Bale and the son were perfect. Damon was good, not great. Didn't really like how the executive's were cast at all though.

f839gip,"Very disappointed. The movie does a lot of great things, the main characters are good and well acted. The cars are phenomenal and the technical aspects are handled fairly well.

However the bad things take the movie down by a lot. The movie insists on putting up ""good guys vs bad guys"" scenarios to the point that it felt forced and stupid. Most of the characters outside of Miles and Shelby are bidimensional. All of the italians (the drivers, the mechanics, the guys at Ferrari's factory) look like stereotypical mafiosos. Bandini throws the race by suddenly forgetting how to drive and blowing up the engine.

The movie could have been so much better. Rush is a much better movie about racing overall.",dvu5es
f7kg9ha,"This is excellent. 

But it'd be better with about 15 minutes trimmed. 

Don't misunderstand: it doesn't drag, really, but YMMV on that opinion if you don't enjoy just watching Bale and Damon do their thing.",dvu5es
f7wwt14,"I found it extremely generic to be honest, but the racing sequences were stellar. My main problem with the movie is that there's no depth to any relationship between characters. Everything sort of starts ""in the moment"" and there's no backstory on how Damon and Bale met or became friends. I never really felt like they were such close friends, so the ending scene wasn't earned. The depiction of the wife as this stay-at-home, cook-me-a-sandwich, hysterical woman was ridiculous, as well as the exaggerated acting from the ""villains.""",dvu5es
f7tn669,"I bloody love this movie but for some reason, I have extra respect for it because I feel like it could have easily been a flop without the phenomenal directing.

f7ugdau,"Ford vs. Ferrari was an enjoyable, exciting movie with one large caveat.

The Good:

* Matt Damon and Christian Bale are excellent. Their performances are effortless and they play off each other well.

* The racing sequences are beautifully shot and directed. I've only seen a handful of racing movies, so maybe this is isn't unique, but the turns were visceral. You could hear the cars creaking and groaning as they performed difficult maneuvers.

* There's a particular scene where Henry Ford Jr. is sobbing because the race car he's been driven around in is beyond anything he expected. It starts out as funny and transitions seamlessly into a dramatic moment of wishing his father could've experienced the same thing. Scenes like that aren't easy and I thought I should note it.

The Bad:

* This movie is looooooooong. Too long. And I think it feels that way because it can't decide whether it's a biopic or the story of Ford trying to compete with Ferarri. So, they include many personal notes about (mostly) Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby and also many scenes of dealing with corporate suits that all feel the same. It's just too much. It was in the middle of the Daytona race that I thought, ""Jesus, there's a whole other race we have to watch!""

* I hate corporate suit characters. The just feel fake. Josh Lucas and Jon Bernthal do an admirable job of trying to breathe life into them, but it's a waste of their talents. Especially Bernthal's.

This movie was a lot of fun to watch. I'd compare it to The Martian in that way. It's not a melodrama. Horribly sad things are not going to happen to the protagonists.

I'm a pretty big racing fan and this got great reviews so I had to go see it. And I hated it. There was absolutely zero character development in this movie. The plot was basically that Ford execs are incompetent assholes and Ken Miles is inexplicably strange and good with cars. The racing scenes were pretty terrible in my opinion, so much of it didn't make sense. They had tons of famous racing drivers they could have included in the movie but they didn't even bother. And the ending is hollow and poorly done. >!We have no idea why Ken even made the decision to slow down for the other Fords because nobody even bothers to ask him about the whole thing.

The parts where Damon screws with the Ferrari crew (timer and nut) and where the exec just acts super evil (the beef didn’t seem justified) were a bit much; I don’t even care if it’s historically accurate it detracted from the story in my opinion and made the film seem long.

But then the door worked fine for the rest of the race and I was like, oh okay. And sort of just forgot about it. Then as soon as that final test-driving scene started my stomach sank. When Shelby went to visit Peter at the end my tears were going hard. Wow. I really had no idea it had such a heartbreaking ending, the race in general and his life.

Christian Bale is fantastic, though I was never really with Matt Damon. I wish Shelby had been played by someone else, but I can't figure out who. Jon Bernthal was underused but great. But yeah, I think it's a crowded film for Actor this year, but I'd be very down with a Bale nomination.

I love a good racing film but I've never actually sat down to watch a race. I remember after Rush came out I was like, yeah, I'll get into Formula One. I did not. I have now told myself, yeah, I'll watch Le Mans. I will most likely not.

f7np0u9,"I definitely enjoyed this movie and would go see it again. There are a couple blemishes that you can pick up on. The first one is if you're familiar with some NASCAR race tracks they used Auto Club Speedway in LA as a fill in for Daytona Speedway during the Daytona 24 segment, It does a good job at filling in for Daytona, although I think if the producers were able to get the real track it would've been nice. As some others have mentioned a bit of drama is also used like when Shelby takes Ferrari's stop watches, which seems a little far fetch, but those elements are kept to a minimum. The movie also does seem to make Leo Beebe as the antagonist to ken miles achieving a win and the triple crown at le mans, which I think was the film not being able to explain the circumstances of that race and what Henry Ford 2 wanted.   


As for the soundtrack, it's a definitely must listen and is really well done and timed perfectly for the movie.",dvu5es

Also, a lot of people are saying Beebe was cut out to be a lot more shallow on screen than he really was. However (in my opinion), even if the rivalry was not as vocal as depicted, it was nonetheless a dirty game of politics. Even if Beebe didn't know the dead heat wouldn't result as a tie (and pictures show that the #2 Ford GT crossed the finish a good bit before Miles; possibly instructed by Beebe?), he very well knew he was robbing Ken of his rightful victory - passing the glory up the ladder - right where Beebe, as head of the racing division, wanted it. It makes sense that Beebe would want a racer that would win quietly because he wanted the fame. He even said in the movie that Miles was ""too pure."" A sweeping victory for Miles would put him down in history as the man responsible rather than ""Ford.""",dvu5es

This is the base structure of nearly all Oscar bait-y Hollywood biopics, but I find these tropes kind of annoying and tedious. That is why Ford v Ferrari will not make my personal best list for this year, despite the merits of its subject matter, performances, art direction, and even my liking for cars.

f8cl1iu,"so im coming from a motorsports lover. i also simrace a lot, iracing, rf2, ams, ac, rre you name it. real cars not so much, i like money and cars are expensive, so theres that. regardless, historic cars always fascinate me in these games, i never drive them competitively, trying to squeeze out every tenth of a second i can, im just rather curious how these iconic cars drive, just taking them around some tracks for fun

and obviously i have watched the grand tour special about this perticular rivalry. 3 years ago theyve done one which was amazing and that was my basis of knowledge before going into this movie. 

so i did expect historical accuracy from this move and i come out with mixed feelings.

yes, it did get the majority of things right and truthful but some elements were just a bit made to fit hollywood.


so lets talk about some things i didnt like, 1965 was completely skipped as far as i know, just straight up skipped that year. dont like that.

second of all, of course simracing is not real life but those cars were a little sped up. they do not accelerate and go through corners as fast as they showed in the movie. they may have been fast in 1966 but compared to even standard road cars from today, these cars are boats. i wouldnt be surprised if a modern golf could beat that gt40 mk2 in a race track and you sure as hell wouldnt show a golf being as fast as these cars. 

what was a little weird to me was the death from ken miles. yes it was historically accurate but they couldve made it more emotional, i was ready to hold back my tears but then they just went straight away from that. i guess they did that because they did not want to end that movie on a sad note but if you dont know 100% he died youre kinda expecting him to show in the next scenes, hes already survived that one huge explosion, so wouldnt be too far fetched no? they coulda cut a few minutes, 10-20, i didnt need all the wife/son interactions 

REGARDLESS, it is still mostly historically accurate, the visuals were great, the actors were great and all that stuff, its already been said so its absolutely still a good movie and as a motorsport fan im obviously very happy that such a movie was done. rush already did that few years ago with the nikki lauda vs james hunt rivalry and that movie was also incredibly good. but i do have to admit, i do prefer rush over this one.

The visuals and sounds were unreal, definitely a film you have to see at a cinema. The acting was good, few weak points but nothing to ruin the film. Enjoyed Christian Bale's British accent and some of the truly British sayings. 

What I didn't like was the historical inaccuracies, so many things were missed out or even changed, made the film feel like it was a 2 hour long Ford commercial that actually made me dislike Ford even more. I've never been into Ford's, I respect the GT40, but nothing else they've made has ever given me the 'fizz'. They made rubbish cars back then, and today they still do. 

The film portraying Enzo out to bee some kind of villain was weird too. Why did they show him up in the box at the end, Ford knew about the finish issue way before the race ended, they're the ones who screwed over Miles. 

Even knowing the ending, it was still a very sad, especially as Miles pretty much got robbed for the win because Ford wanted a promo photo.

And why was Jon Bernthal in this? WTF was his character’s point?

I fully admit I am no film connoisseur but I have no earthly idea how this film has gotten as good a reception as it has. 

This isn’t a movie for people who find Top Gear entertaining. It’s a movie for people who find Top Gear inspirational.

Does that mean he lost that race? It's never explained in the movie but Shelby did win one Le Mans. Or does the road darkening meant to signify him getting pulled out of his memory due to the doctor?",dvu5es

It came out of nowhere and tainted the whole film. I didn’t know anything about this story before going into the theater. I actually laughed at the end and I feel the real Ken Miles deserved so much better. There’s no setup for it, no real payoff. Would have been better just to say it with text in the credits.

The person who made it probably has never seen cars or racing before.   

Bloody hell, giddy up.  Stealing a stopwatch.   Millions of gear changes.   Constantly revving. Cringe.    Bit of a comedy.

Absolutely loved the movie, but one thing, why in tf was Mollie so mad at Ken for meeting up with Shelby to take a first look at the GT. A little before her absolute maniac episode, they had a discussion about Ken leaving racing after the garage was seized by the IRS, and she encouraged him to stay if that's what he loved and that leaving to get a job wouldn't solve a thing. Yet when he just goes to look at a car, she goes fuckin nuts. I just don't understand the point of that scene is, at all. She does say that she doesn't want him to lie about it, but she is the one that encouraged him to continue in the first place. It's like, he decides to leave racing so they can pay the bills, she encourages him to continue, and then she's getting mad at him for continuing. I just, cannot understand this.",dvu5es

Similarly when Shelby makes a sale and then realises he’s already sold the car to Steve McQueen, it’s a rather neat connection since McQueen went on to make his own film about the 24 hours of Le Mans in the early 70’s.",dvu5es

So between Bale, and Damon's salaries, the cost of making a period piece and what I would assume are extravagant costs for the cars and racing would make it a tough sell.

Detroit car companies were not well versed in racing at all before Ford started their racing program (s). There was an agreement between the big 3 and their subsidiaries to limit horsepower and not officially support racing. 

Because of this Ford had no idea how to race let alone race 24 hours against Ferrari. 

Ford won because they could out spend Ferrari. It took multiple attempts over many years (haven't seen the film yet - so not sure how much backstory they show) Ferrari pulled an asshole move to start the rivalry.",dvu5es

Goes Like Hell and Goes Like Hell S'more.  Being two Mopar fans with a plain-jane Omni in the long list of cars that have been in the family, my dad and I enjoyed that.  On top of that, when the original Dodge Viper was greenlit as a modern-day Shelby Cobra, Lee Iacocca was an exec at Chrysler.  Shelby would drive the prototype at the 1991 Indy 500.

In reality Ford were trying to get to the end of the race without their drivers pushing each other, which would risk them walking away with nothing if the engines exploded or they crashed into each other. They only realised after they gave the order that the dead heat would screw Miles, and they had no back-up plan and no pit to car radio in those days, so they couldn’t tell the drivers without calling both of them into the pits; really it was just a cock up, but it happened because Beebe and the rest of the Ford execs didn’t know the rules, not because they hated Miles.",dvu5es

f7lk23m,"It’s very kind of you to try to find this out. The other replies here are accurate in my opinion. I’ll add that one character does succeed in escaping a burning car, but that scene emphasizes the horror and powerlessness of the other characters present.

f7mlbb6,"There are 3 moments with drivers and fire. One in the very beginning, where a character is set abalaze due to mishandled fuel. He is quickly put out and completely unhurt, and the moment is played off somewhat comedically.

The 2nd is towards the middle of the film and is by far the most graphic. You clearly see the car impact and go up in a fireball and him getting pulled out of a burning car. The character is rescued but this moment is 100 times more serious than the first one though hes mostly unharmed. 

The third is at the very end of the film. A character crashes but the impact is off screen, though you see the smoke and fireball appear over a hill concealing the accident. This crash is fatal but you never directly see the character or car on fire.

Hope that helps.",dvu5es

He is trying to create a Ferrari-like racing Dept for Ford, but whenever there is a big decision he has to go up against (and acquiesce to) Leo Bidde (the head marketing guy).

Interesting thing is, Walt Hansgen also went to Le Mans and died a few days after a crash in qualifying trying to beat Miles' time. This scene wasn't in the film but it is addressed in the shooting script, which makes me think they cut it for time/pacing reasons. A shame as I reckon that would have been an interesting scene seeing Miles' reaction to that.

fh6yej5,"In the film I agree, the guy is written as a petty sycophant with zero redeeming qualities. In real life though, whilst he could be ruthless and blunt when the results weren’t coming, and he didn’t think Miles was much of a team player, he was also a professional who didn’t let that get in the way of doing his job; he wanted to win Le Mans for his boss Henry Ford II, who was also his best friend that he served with in WW2. The problem was that he had no experience in racing whatsoever. As a result he was very naive about how the sport actually worked, and made a big mistake thinking there wouldn’t be a tie break in the event of a dead heat. I don’t see that as much of a sin though, given that most of the general audience is actually in the same boat prior to watching the film; they don’t know much about racing either, but they learn about it through Shelby, and especially the scenes between Ken and his son. The dead heat was just a cock-up, plain and simple; by the time the officials told Beebe it wouldn’t work, the drivers had already been instructed; there was no plan B. Other stuff, like forcing Miles to sit out Le Mans ‘65, was fabricated for dramatic effect, so again you can’t really blame the real Beebe for that.

They were absolutely correct in making Beebe the antagonist of the film, because he didn’t get on with Miles and was the exact opposite of him in almost every respect; where they went wrong IMHO was turning him into a cartoony villain with very thin motivations.

f7xn6d8,"> I loved Tracey Letts' performance as Henry Ford II. The character postures and acts like a corporate titan but that moment in the car when he's crying shows he's just trying to prove to his father (and grandfather) that he can run the company. He didn't build the company or earn his way to the top, it's just some game so he doesn't look like daddy's boy to the other car owners. It's all just for show, like where Ferrari sits and watches the whole race Ford decides to helicopter out for a nice dinner.

I love how the film made the portrayal work, like you mentioned. It's like we saw two brief moments of sincerity from him:

* Him breaking down in the car, crying because he's trying to prove to his Father he can run the company.

* Him flying away from LeMans because he doesn't give a shit about the race at all and coming back the next day. 

Might even throw in:

* Him celebrating the victory trophy with McClaren. 


And I love how Ferrari like you said, is in it for an entirely different reason. She shares this with Ken Miles, taking off his hat in salute. He knew Miles was in it for the race, for the love of pushing the car to the limit. He respected Miles. But he also warned him. It's as ominous as it is respectful. He knows the judges ranking and how Miles got screwed and how Ford, doesn't really give a shit. Even though Miles could've had it all, he was loyal and it screwed him. Commendatori.

It failed miserably and the GT40 was hopelessly unreliable, so they went to Shelby for '65 onwards. It simplifies the script greatly for Ford to go straight to Shelby in the first place rather than include the year with Wyer beforehand, as besides being team manager of Aston Martin during Shelby's win at Le Mans in 1959, he has no other relevance to Ford during the time period shown in the film. (The film ends before Wyer wins Le Mans again running GT40's in '68 and '69) After the failure of '65, that was when Ford gave Shelby and co. the blank cheque to do whatever it took to win in '66.

The scene at Daytona must be set in 1966, because they show Walt Hansgen finishing 3rd in another GT40 for Holman Moody, which he did not compete in in 1965.",dvu5es

Whilst Ken Miles' story ends in tragedy, but we mustn't forget what he did achieve during his career; for a lot of drivers just finishing the full 24 hour distance at races like Daytona and Le Mans is a huge achievement.

Bruce McLaren (Mile's teammate) said it best: “To do something well is so worthwhile that to die trying to do it better cannot be foolhardy. It would be a waste of life to do nothing with one's ability, for I feel that life is measured in achievement, not in years alone.”",dvu5es

Both drivers would have been at full throttle for the entire Mulsanne straight, though I could see the tension of them both delaying their upshifts and letting the revs get too high (leading to the Ferrari blowing its engine). Not to mention the Ford had a clear straight line speed advantage over the Ferrari, so it should have been a fairly easy pass for Miles by the time he caught up.",dvu5es
fclymvo,"Yeah, I remember the character in question. (Leo Beebe, played by Josh Lucas) The situation with Peter sitting in the car is more just the catalyst for Miles to mouth off about the Ford Mustang being ""a secretary's car"", and his tirade deeply hurts Beebe's pride.

I also got a sense of elitism from Beebe; he isn't just put off by Miles' personality, but also because he is not an ""All-American driver"" like the others available to him; he even explicitly lists the likes of Phil Hill, Bob Bondurant, Richie Ginther and Walt Hansgen as ""Ford friendly"" drivers he would rather have instead; all of them are natural-born U.S. drivers. (And incidentally all pretty accomplished in their own right) Miles was by that point a naturalised American citizen, but I definitely felt like Beebe didn't see or respect him as a true American; when it comes to nationality Miles is referred to as a ""limey Brit"" IIRC.

In real life it's clear they didn't get on, but I don't think it was quite to the same degree or for the same reasons. Beebe may not have liked Miles but he did at least recognise his skills as a driver; he never stopped him from going to Le Mans in 1965 like he does in the film for instance. The photo finish screwing Miles out of the win happened mainly because Beebe was worried about the cars retiring from being pushed too hard, as 8 Fords had dropped out earlier in the race and he could not afford to disappoint his boss (and his friend whom he formed a lifelong bond with having fought together in the trenches during WW2) Henry Ford II by letting a repeat of the previous year's disaster happen again. 

Beebe also didn't understand the rules regarding the dead heat (And to be fair nobody else at Ford seemed to either; even Shelby agreed at the time, despite later regretting it) and the officials decided to tell Beebe after the call was given to the drivers that the dead heat wouldn't work because they'd break the tie by giving victory to the car that had travelled the furthest distance; in this case the #2 Ford driven by Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon as it had started about 8 metres behind Miles' car on the starting grid. Beebe was actually horrified because he could see the potential PR fallout of Miles being cheated out of victory, and even asked if they could protest the result, but this was denied; in real life it was just a cock-up, plain and simple, although Miles was understandably quite bitter about it. By contrast the film strongly hints that Beebe had concocted this machiavellian plan with the express intention of screwing Miles. (Shelby is even shown accusing him of this)

All in all I actually felt that Beebe got a pretty raw deal with the way he is portrayed here, although to be clear that's not the fault of Josh Lucas; he played Beebe very well as a petty and unlikeable corporate slimeball, but I feel like in vilifying Beebe into a sycophantic caricature the writers made his motivations very thin and not as compelling as they perhaps could have been; it honestly weakens that conflict with Miles and makes it pretty one-dimensional.

If you want more information I made a video on the real life story and how closely the film follows it, and where it diverges and why: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYVzwR\_RKCE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYVzwR_RKCE)",dvu5es
f8st4cp,"Well, to be fair Miles' entire battle with Bandini for the first 3/4's of the race was completely made up; Bandini never led the '66 24 hours and his car actually dropped out before midnight. However I can forgive this since Bandini did win in 1963, and as the film basically didn't show the Le Mans races from 1960-'65 where they dominated, it made a lot of sense to have them in a much stronger position in the film. By 1967 both Bandini and Miles had died in accidents driving racing cars, so it's appropriate and touching in a way that they end up facing each other on track.

They were quite ambitious to actually tackle the dead heat in the film, since it's such a convoluted and confusing series of events. I think modern audiences wouldn't have heard of the dead heat, however motorsport and endurance racing fans almost certainly have; (It's the defining image of the 1966 24 hours of Le Mans) they knew they couldn't get away with changing the finish if they wanted credibility with the film's built-in audience. I noticed a lot of people didn't understand why exactly the win got taken from Miles; to be honest it was just as confusing in real life, and I think the film captured that pretty accurately in that post-race scene where Miles expects everyone to crowd around him, and the penny drops when instead McLaren ends up being given the winner's plaudits, much to his own surprise.",dvu5es

2. I’d guess Ken Miles was known as a good driver in that circle, at least enough to get the attention of someone like Shelby, but I doubt he was a household name. It’s hard for me to say though, since I certainly wasn’t alive back then and I really only know of him from Shelby/Le Mans.",dvu5es

P.S.  If you do a little research on the Ford guy they made the villain, he had some reasons for worrying about Miles.  In this race, Miles kept going hard when he didn't need to, since the Ferrari's had been out of the race for a while.  He felt Miles should have backed off to make sure his car finished the race.

The reason they don't show Shelby building/designing the car from scratch is because Ford already had a car they were basing the GT40 on: The Lola Mk.6, (A.K.A. Lola GT), built in Slough, England by Lola founder/designer Eric Broadley to compete at Le Mans in 1963; Ford were impressed with the car's speed, despite it's unreliability, and basically bought the Mk.6 to develop it further and brought on Broadley to the team as a consultant. 

In the film, when Shelby introduces Miles to the GT40, he mentions that the car ""Just got off the plane from England"", and soon after Broadley himself shows up in the film to inform Miles that he has already put a high-displacement cubic V8 engine into a Ford GT prototype. What the film doesn't mention is that Broadley fell out with Ford because he wanted to use an aluminium chassis instead of the steel one that his American employers wanted, among other issues. Broadley didn't like what the execs were doing to his vision, so he quit after just a year; meaning it's unlikely that he would have had much interaction with Ken Miles or Carroll Shelby since they were bought on at about the same time that he left (Late 1964), but it's nice of the film to include his contribution, even though it doesn't do a great job of explaining it.",dvu5es

f8myeah,Bale's accent was all wrong. He had a cockney accent (presumably because that's the only working class accent American movie goers recognise) but Miles actually had a thick Brummie accent (from Birmingham) which sounds completely different but is pretty unappealing and had a lot of negative stereotypes attached to it in the UK (such as making the person speaking sound stupid),dvu5es
f92ygpr,"The dead heat itself at the end of the 1966 24 hours of Le Mans absolutely did happen at the behest of Ford, although the film suggests that Leo Beebe concocted it with the intention of screwing Miles over, which seems unlikely as he was actually horrified about the PR fallout when the officials told him that a tie wouldn't be possible. 

It's also true that Miles did not get on with Ford's execs particularly well. The head of Ford's advanced vehicle technologies, Jacque Passino, once said: ""Miles would race his Grandmother to the breakfast table"", which wasn't meant as a compliment. Miles had a reputation for not following team instructions until the last few hours of a race. Sebring in 1966 is a good example; Miles pressured teammate Dan Gurney early in the race, and when Shelby told him to slow down Miles gave him the middle finger, before eventually dropping a lap down on Gurney when the American's engine blew up on the very final lap of the race; Miles got the win because Gurney jumped out and pushed his car over the finish line, leading to disqualification. Beebe was of the opinion that Gurney would have finished and Ford would have locked out the podium had Miles not put so much pressure upon him and forced Gurney to push his engine so much.

Miles being forced to sit out Le Mans in 1965 stood out because it was the one of the few scenes in the film that was totally fabricated, everything else, even conversations that didn't take place, were at least built upon things that did happen.",dvu5es

Club-level sportscar racing didn't pay particularly well in the 50's and '60's, and Miles was not exactly the best business manager in the world; most of the money he had, he spent on developing his racing cars, like his own MG special, nicknamed: ""The Flying Shingle"".

Originally John Wyer, the former Aston Martin Le Mans boss who helped Shelby to win in 1959, did all the testing near his base in England. Ford’s original idea was that instead of running it from the US they would let Wyer work with Ford Europe, but ultimately this turned into a disaster as Ford basically tried to rush everything by committee, and the car broke down in every race in 1964. Wyer was made the scapegoat, and Shelby was then bought in to replace Wyer since his Cobras had won their class at Le Mans by finishing 4th overall. So the cars were built in England because A) Ford Advanced Vehicles, their prototype division, was already there. B) It was a holdover from Ford’s earlier attempts with Wyer, which the film omitted, but it did at least include that scene to hint at the contribution of the team at FAV in Slough.

Interestingly Eric Broadley does show up in a small scene later in the film; he is the character who explains to Miles and Shelby the performance benefits of the V8 engine he has already fitted into a prototype GT40; it’s also implied that him and Ken know each other since they are on first name terms.",dvu5es

If he had died maybe a year later then I could maybe agree with you, but for me it would have felt incomplete without those last few scenes.!<

>!What I will concede is that as an epilogue it's a bit rushed and we don't really spend enough time on it for it to really have the impact that it should. Part of the tragedy is that because Miles followed his orders and played ball with the dead heat, he lost what should have been the sportscar triple crown; (Daytona, Sebring and Le Mans all in the same season) he would have been the first in history to do it as well, and for the rest of his life Shelby felt that was the one regret he had, giving Miles that instruction, and helping Ford to screw over his friend; Miles should have taken the Le Mans trophy and that crowning achievement with him to his grave.

It also challenges the jingoistic narrative that Ford won entirely due to the efforts of American engineering. (I mean, having Ken Miles be the key driver that the film focuses on already challenges that, although technically by the early 60's he was officially a naturalised American citizen) I will confess though, they didn't really go into much detail beyond: ""Hey, why are we doing this now?"" ""Because it makes the car go faster."" without going into any real detail as to why/how it makes it faster...But given that the film focuses on the human drama it would probably alienate the layman audience had they gone into more detail. 

Personally I wish they had shown the death of Walt Hansgen in the test day a few weeks before Le Mans; especially as he died trying to beat Miles' fastest laptime. Would have helped reinforce the dangers of the sport, and as they introduced Hansgen earlier in the film as a rival to Miles it would have made a lot of sense emotionally.

Beebe doesn't know that, he just doesn't want to see an embarrassing flameout like in the previous year (and we didn't see that race firsthand, just heard the radio reports which keep us pretty distant). And for the finish, it comes across like Beebe knew that Ken would lose out on first and this was his sneaky way of sandbagging him, when in fact he didn't realize this. It was still a stupid thing to do, but in real life it seems to have been coming from a place of ""It's my job to make Ford racing look good, how can I get a great image that does that"" not ""How can I sneakily ensure that Ken Miles doesn't get to win this race?""",dvu5es

f7w32z8,"Prefacing this with the fact that I had no previous knowledge of the history of Ford, Ferrari, Shelby, Miles, or Le Mans, other than Ford having a Mustang named after Shelby.

>The big game, of course, refers to the fact the the climax of any movie about competition can only have three outcomes:  The hero wins, the hero loses, or in some cases the hero fails to compete (which one, could argue is the same as losing).  The problem is that the audience knows the ending will be one of those outcomes.

Not sure why that is a problem, as with any competition there is a winner and loser, and in rarer cases a draw, but the audience still shows up to watch.

>What is needed then is to reward the audience for their time, with great character portrayal, sparkling dialog and behind the scenes intrigue as to how the hero skills and knowledge operate.

I thought Shelby and Miles were portrayed spectacularly, with Molly and Peter arguably weaker, overshadowed by Damon and Bale's monstrous performance. IMO, we are shown the skills and knowledge of Shelby and Miles. Shelby's win at Le Mans in the opening scene establishes the fact that he is a stellar racer. Throughout the course of the film, Shelby is seen speaking to himself in parallel with Miles's racing line, corner entries, and exits. More than once he says, ""wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, now!"" as Miles overtakes one of his opponents. This shows Miles is at the very least of the same caliber as Shelby, as well as both their knowledge of the tracks and how to attack them. Miles is also shown bringing up many, many of the mechanical deficiencies of the prototypes he is driving. He senses the inefficient air flow around the front of the car in one of the first prototypes and proves it right after by attaching aerodynamic strips all over the car. He foreshadows all of the problems with the car in the race that he did not get to attend, and they are confirmed as he listens on the radio while working at the shop, i.e., the tender gearbox that needed the driver to be more gentle on. In another scene, he demonstrates knowledge of the car's limits, saying he can feel the car wanting to go above 7k RPM, and when he does push it over, the engine does not blow, in contrast to the Ferrari at Le Mans.

>I was fully aware of the true story's outcome, but it didn't matter because I *cared about the heros*.

I was rooting for Shelby and Miles. Shelby, who fought his heart out for Miles, who put his whole company's stake on the line to Ford because he believed in Miles, believed he was the one who could win Le Mans for Ford. Miles, the arrogant prick who we get to see has a soft side when he is willing to get a day job and quit racing for Molly, when he carries Peter up the stairs and tucks him in to bed, when he praises Peter's sketch of Le Mans and explains the track to him, when he takes him out on the runway and explains to him the perfect lap. Lastly, his character development was completed during the last lap of Le Mans, when he actually slows down for his teammates to get the photo finish desired by the Ford team. I had actually wanted Miles to beat his own record on the last lap, but his sacrifice here, if nothing else previously, most certainly proved that he was not a one-dimensional character.

I shed a tear when Shelby gave Peter back Miles's wrench. Shelby, the great salesman, acknowledging that words didn't mean anything. That nothing would come close to healing the void left behind by the passing of such a raw, emotional, and dedicated soul in the world of racing, whose sole purpose in life was to balance on the edge of 7,000 RPMS.",dvu5es

It was a very pretty looking, relatively entertaining popcorn flick, with some great sound design to boot. But seeing the word masterpiece being thrown around in this discussion is utterly absurd. 

I cannot agree with you enough about the depiction of the Italians in this movie. Enzo Ferrari is made to look like some sort of evil Mussolini-like character & his racers are a bunch of mute, evil henchmen.

I love Christian Bale, but IMO his performance was hampered by the fact that I didn’t really know much about him other than the fact that he plays by his own rules and knows his shit about cars/racing. Sure I felt bad when he got screwed over at the end of the race and his death was definitely tragic, especially considering all the bullshit he went through. But as someone who tears up quite frequently at movies, I just wasn’t invested enough in his character and/or his family to get that emotional punch they were going for.

That's well put and I agree.  I don't agree Bale's role is more interesting. 

They both have great arcs. Damon has to be the stronger man even with his heart issue and leaving the drivers seat behind. He has to hold it together and that makes his breakdown at the end all the more powerful.  Bale is humbled by bad personal decisions (finance and temper) and that makes his growth and redemption all the more powerful.

If what you're saying is that Bale gets more opportunities to perform depth, I'd agree there. Bale also gets more intimate screen time. Damon is acting with a lot of layers throughout though.  I found the ""you're welcome"" gambit every bit as compelling as the ""perfect lap"" scene.",dvu5es

I think the direction, score, acting and in particular the racing sequences in Ford V Ferrari/Le Mans '66 are a match for anything that's in Rush though; one of my few gripes about Rush was that at times the cars felt a little too clean and overly polished, and it seemed like race footage was being sped up in a very noticeable way; I didn't feel this way about Le Mans '66; the cars felt dirty and battle worn as the 24 hour races went on. but TBF I have a huge soft sport for Rush having seen it at least 8-10 times now and I've only seen this film the once.",dvu5es

Miles risked blowing his engine like Ferrari had done, however, it paid off as he and Shelby believed their car could handle it. Ford may have feared pushing the redline limit meant possible engine failure and losing a leading position in the race.

Miles let them catch up so the three could all finish together in first. For Le Mans, the two Ford GT40s that were not driven by Miles started further back on the grid. The rules had stated those GT40s technically traveled further than Miles had and therefore supersede him. In real life, Ford had asked the officials if the three way tie was legal and they said it would be fine, however, the officials changed their mind and cited a rule that had negated their original decision. Le Mans is an endurance race, officials believed the cars traveling further deserved the win. To many, this is strange as the position on the starting line is usually meant to be an advantage for those who qualify faster and the finish line should be the only factor.",dvu5es
f84ffbf,"I dunno, I kind of felt when they showed the Ferrari team to be histrionic and chaotic, that it was a fairly accurate representation of the squad at the time: In the early 60’s Enzo suffered what today is nicknamed “The palace revolt” where all of his best engineers and mechanics defected (They fell out with his wife basically) and decided to build their own team, ATS, which ended up failing horribly. Enzo ended up having to basically substitute in his B-team of loyal understudies, who were not as experienced, which is why all the mechanics shown in the film are much younger than Enzo. In the 60’s there was always some kind of drama going on at Ferrari, often because Enzo loved being the centre of attention. (I.E. He would threaten to quit because “We can’t compete against Ford’s limitless budget, we’ve already lost this race already...” ‘Can’t win, won’t play’ basically)

I disagree on Bandini; he was shown to put up a very good fight against Miles, and I think the engine blew up because Ferrari rushed the 330 P3 out to try and stop Ford taking their Le Mans crown; they didn’t get much chance to test it because their test driver died in a crash and destroyed their prototype in the process. The Ford was reliable due to Miles and Shelby’s development work; Bandini didn’t get the same luxury.

I agree that Rush is the slightly better movie in terms of the incredible true story that it’s based on, and the main conflict being more central to the story, although I would argue that Enzo is shown in a much worse light in that movie; he does not give a fuck about Niki Lauda; even when Niki is fighting for his life in hospital, he assumes Niki is already dead and hires Carlos Reuttemann as his replacement without even checking.",dvu5es

However, his wife and son's accents and word-uses were less accurate (his wife saying 'take out the garbage' was particularly jarring), and the British mechanic/helper on the Ford team saying ""Cor Blimey"" at one point literally made me laugh out loud.

f837u5x,"I felt like they did a really decent job at making what is these days a fairly niche subject, more accessible to a modern audience. Sportscar racing was something that captured the public's imagination in the United States back in the 60's, and they did a good job of capturing that mood of the time, the space race attitude of breaking records, doing challenging technological feats of engineering that hadn't been done before. I can understand though if the first couple of scenes don't grab you that you might not enjoy the film, since it doesn't get distracted from it's premise; it jumps from Carroll Shelby and his heart condition to Ken Miles and his family, to Henry Ford's struggles to rebrand his company and live up to his family name, and then it very much stays with these characters for the rest of the film. If there isn't a thread there that pulls you in or interests you, then I can see why it might be a hard watch especially if you're not invested by the time the racing scenes are in full swing.

For example the way they talk about RPMs. There was a scene where he clearly shifted 4->5 into a corner. Also the scene when he was like ""Oh i gotta go a bit faster, better put that pedal all the way in now"". (In a real race, especially on straights, you are either breaking 100% or accelerating 100% ) Or how it seemed he didn't slow down a bit into a hard corner going over 200mph (That corner looked like you wouldn't be able to go over 50 without putting it into a ditch). Also the final bit, when he started to slow down for the other guys and he shifted right away without droping the revs even a bit. (Do that in a real car and you got youself a blown engine)

No, this film dramatized events and was not completely accurate to history. The film is wrong in depicting 1966 as the only time Miles raced a GT40 at Le Mans. Miles actually participated in the 1965 race at Le Mans, driving the No. 98 Ford along with Bruce McLaren, *then* won Daytona the following year.

Similarly I don't think the film holds up Enzo Ferrari as a villain. Atleast as far as the ending goes. The Ferrari team is set up as an almost comical, mafia-type ""family"" of car-makers. But that last shot where he tips his hat to Miles seems to be saying ""welcome to my world. Where politics triumphs over actual talent."" Atleast that's what I got from his hat-tip.

Ford had nothing to do with the production apart from providing some archival footage and whatnot I believe. The film never really frames Ford as a company to look up to, nor even as a place you'd want to work at. They probably should have been titled it Shelby v. Ford.

> The film portraying Enzo out to bee some kind of villain was weird too. Why did they show him up in the box at the end,

Pillock = Socially acceptable term for dickhead. (This one is pretty common, especially in Northern England, but it gets some usage down south too.)

All around the Wrekin = The long way around. (Similar to ""around the houses"" or ""Up the garden path"". The Wrekin is a big hill in East Shropshire. This is the only one that I didn't really recognise as it's kind of region-specific to the Midlands)

Me old mucca = My old mate/friend.

Cob = Sandwich (It's a particular type of bread loaf that we have in the UK) 

There is a great story actually about Miles' accent. At Daytona Shelby teamed him up with an American driver, Lloyd Ruby, (Who appears briefly in the movie) who was famous for his really thick Texan accent. (Far thicker than Shelby's) Miles couldn't understand Ruby, and Ruby sure as hell couldn't understand Miles' Brummie accent.

It's not that she wants him to choose one way or the other, but she wants to know what he's thinking and what's going on, to feel like a part of his life and not just a sort of tangential ornament.

>Copying Ferrari's tactic of overwhelming numbers, they put in fifteen Mark II entrants; **eight were accepted by the ACO**. This time **six were built and prepared by Shelby American**. Shelby ran three cars himself for Americans Dan Gurney and Jerry Grant, Miles was now paired with New Zealander Denny Hulme after Ruby had been injured in a plane-crash a month earlier.[11] The third car was the all-Kiwi pairing of Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon. Holman & Moody, the successful Ford NASCAR race-team was bought on board to race another trio – for Mark Donohue/Paul Hawkins, Ronnie Bucknum/Dick Hutcherson and Lucien Bianchi/Mario Andretti.[12] One of the big improvements Holman & Moody brought with them was a quick-change brakepad system to save time in the pits.

But overall they do a real good job showing the politics between Ferrari and Ford, Ferrari screws Ford out of a deal to side with Fiat so it's not just Henry II's ego leading things, but Ford also outspends Enzo and screws over Ken Miles badly so they're very morally grey, Ford's position is the most accurately portrayed part of the film IMO.",dvu5es

If you PC game or watch a lot of content on PC, or play xbox and don't use a surround system, I highly recommend the Dolby Atmos surround virtualization.   Soundblaster used to have some great virtualization on some of their cards but soundcards have somewhat fallen out of fashion, and the software virtualization has gotten really good.   At the least, people should use the free windows sonic.

The film also implies that McLaren, the winner of the race, was so inept that he was waaay behind Miles, to the point that he basically has to stop the car to wait for them, but in reality it was McLaren's co-driver who set the record for the lap time, not Miles, and they were constantly neck to neck with him in the actual race.

Then there's the whole thing that Miles was never held back from the first Le Mans - he drove there twice before and lost in 55 and 65. The implication that he wasn't allowed to go for a lesser driver to take his place is just downright disrespectful to the other real life people.

""Grandissimo"" is the superlative of ""grande"" (great), think of it as to what ""best"" is to ""good"", and it's usually used when you see someone achieve something amazing, so something like ""amazing/phenomenal/stunning"" probably works better. 

Don't exactly remember if this one had subs, but when Enzo leaves the track to go and get dinner, he makes fun of Ford for leaving early and in an helicopter. 
It's a great moment because it captures how Ferrari felt towards other car manufacturers, industrialism and mass production: he never really cared about road cars, production numbers, or the general public. Hell, some say that he had no interest even in the cars his own company was producing, to him they were just a mean to finance the racing team. He was only interested in racing, and it shows how he looked down on people who had no passion for the sport and were there essentially just as a marketing stunt.

f810088,"There's nothing really crucial to understanding the story that you miss, except that ""Grandissimo"", but just for curiosity sake here is a translation of everything that's said in pasta.

First is the encounter between Iacocca and Ferrari, the one that's translated on the spot by the two assistants: Enzo says ""Go back to your big, ugly factory, making ugly, insignificant cars"" and in the translation ""insignificant"" becomes ""small"".

Even later on, when Iaccoca is reporting to Ford ""insignificant"" remains ""small"". And, as said before, Leo throws in a ""fat"" that Enzo never said.

When Enzo leaves the track, the first bit of the dialogue doesn't have subs. Not really relevant, but the exchange is: 
VP: ""It's already 11, do we go and eat something?""
Enzo: ""Yeah, and maybe take a nap too.""

Then he goes on to say: ""See? It's a car race and he comes by helicopter. How classy.""

When Shelby steals the stopwatches, all the mechanics start yelling ""Where are the stopwatches?! Son of a bitch (as in an exclamation, it wasn't referred to Shelby)""

When the Ferrari mechanics see Ford changing the breaks, they turn to Enzo and tell him ""Commendatore, it's not allowed by the rules!""
And Enzo turns to his VP and tells him to ""Call them (the race officials) and tell them, they are changing the whole brake assembly and that's against the rules!""
The VP on the phone with the officials just says ""What's going on, what are you doing?""

When the P3 comes back into the pits after a break down, you hear the mechanics scream ""Get me the oil!"" And Enzo ""Come on, let's go, be quick!""

Right before Shelby leaves a nut next to Ferrari's garage, you hear the mechanics talk about how ""We are 1 minute ahead, Lorenzo is doing well, the car is fine and the weather is good, let's keep a set of tires just in case, and we need to prepare the clutch later""

I don't mind them making fun of the late John Surtees, but they should at least get his nationality right.

It's actually very unique in it's own way and I would have liked to have seen it as I think it could have built up a tension just as well. But I feel they over Americanised it. Which you can up to a certain point, since the majority of people watching it would probably be American, since it's got Ford stamped all over it with Ferrari being one of the bad guys (I use bad as a relative term here).

I say that interaction was far too Americanised, because as a non-American that's how I think American's would have insulted each out. Not that any other nations don't do it, but for American's. It seems to hold greater weight. So, I was disappointed to learn this difference, that they didn't do the real life thing, but this is just a minor detail.

As this is easily the best movie of 2019 for me. I imagine the Joker would be no.1 but I haven't watched it, since the character makes me really uneasy (not in way that makes me dislike the movie, but in a way it hits far too close to home for my liking.

One of their drivers was Perry McCarthy, who went on to be the original Black-suited Stig in Top Gear, and he wrote an excellent book about his career called ""Flat out, flat broke"", which really goes into what it was like working there; it's hilarious but you also feel sorry for Perry as his dream of being in F1 turns into a nightmare.

f8m3nmh,"It's the way they film it that just doesn't make any sense. To show the driver wanting to go faster, the typical cinematic cliche is:

1. Close-up shot of the driver set their face in a steely expression
2. Close-up shot of their foot on the accelerator pedal - importantly, even though they're flat-out in top gear at 200mph+, there is still some travel (i.e. they don't currently have their foot depressed despite the high speed)
3. Show them press the pedal - not just 'a bit more' but a full press of the pedal as if they weren't previously pressing it
4. Suddenly they magically accelerate away

This is just simply not how it would work. Those cars were already doing max speed or close to it. There is no possibility they had a lot more travel left in the accelerator, nor some unused magic speed that they could suddenly get from somewhere. This happens all the time in car films and it drives me nuts.

In the case of FvF it happens several times in one scene, as the GT40 and Ferrari P3 are side by side down the straight. Miles does it to pull away, the Ferrari then does it, then Miles does it again!",dvu5es

I got the sense that Peter already knew a lot of what Ken was telling him, but he wanted to impress him by showing off his knowledge, (I.E. When Peter points out that in endurance racing you can't go flat out every lap, and Ken praises him) and plus he just loves hearing his Dad talking about what he does best. What adds another dimension is that they used actual quotes from a radio interview with the real Miles for that scene on the runway, which adds even more poignancy.",dvu5es

f7tqmok,"The finish was the only thing where Beebe actually screwed Miles over, and even then it was unintentional because Beebe was put in charge of the Ford racing department despite knowing sod all about racing, and was under huge pressure to make sure Miles and McLaren didn't blow up their engines or crash into each other. In practice a week or two earlier another of Ford's drivers, Walt Hansgen, (Who is in the movie driving at Daytona) died in a crash trying to beat Miles' fastest lap time because it rained and he didn't back off as the team instructed him to, leading to a horrible crash where he rolled the car; he died in hospital a couple of days before the race. So that's why Beebe was so upset when Miles went faster than he was instructed to. It's true that he wasn't keen on Miles, but looking back over the real life events, you can kind of see why Beebe would get the impression that Miles was not a team player. (Even though everyone else thought Miles was a fantastic guy once you got to know him)

I did a video breaking down the whole film scene by scene and comparing it to the real life story; the bit on the dead heat at the end is quite interesting as I go into what factored into Beebe's decision.

f7k8200,"I'd disagree. RUSH had a better flow, better characters, and somehow, felt like it had a better portrayal of *racing*. Death was mentioned in Ford v. Ferrari, but in RUSH, the danger of the sport and just how big these dudes balls were was shoved down your throat. RUSH was a struggle of *one man*, more or less, against the world. (or rather, two men against eachother). ""It handles like a pig"" ""You can't say that!"", etc. This felt a lot more like FORD v. the world. Carol and Ken played a huge role, but the way the politics was portrayed really made it feel like it wasn't as big of an accomplishment as it was. I don't like that they didn't give Ken a proper send-off after his crash during testing. It felt like the movie kind of abruptly ended where there could have been much more closure.

Don't get me wrong, as a motorsports enthusiast and racer myself, I enjoyed the move. It was a solid 7 / 10. But RUSH is a rare 8.5 or 9 out of 10. I really don't know if it's fair to try and compare almost *any* racing movie to it. For instance, on the score - Ford v. Ferrari's score was good, but not really memorable. RUSH's is epic and sticks to your brain like glue. Just a small example of the differences. Regardless, I went to see Ford v. Ferrari on opening night as I really want to support this genre of movie.

I think it was a case of the governing body of Le Mans (The Automobile Club de l'Ouest, or ACO) thinking: ""We've never had a dead heat at Le Mans before, and we're not going to, because that's not how we do things; motor racing doesn't work like that."" (Awarding the win to two cars, and therefore four drivers, would have been unprecedented) So they dug up this old obscure rule to break the tie; fortunately it's not needed to be used since, although Ford nearly caused it to come into play it again in 1969, as the finish that year with the Porsche 917 chasing them was very close at the end!

f82yvsa,"Even though Mangold perfected the generic biopic with Walk the Line. I found Ford v. Ferrari an incredibly personal film for him. Especially considering Mangold's past with studios, he was supposed to be a movie darling. Putting award recognized movies such as Girl Interrupted, Walk the Line, 3:10 to Yuma but he never got the chances the other directors would've gotten. I think if you see the movie through the lens of Mangold's career a man in his 40s, working for a studio, creative sacrifice vs sticking to your guns (that moment when Christian Bale let the other Ford cars come by, it was just a well-executed movie moment). You can see a lot of what he is trying to say of what it was like making Logan or Wolverine.

Plus photography, there was a very simple language to Mangold's camera, non-gimmicky shots and letting the actors make those shots pop! It felt very classical set-ups which I dig.

For me one of the best uses of CGI in a movie. The race sequences felt so real and raw!

The editing and pacing of this movie it's just top-notch I couldn't believe it was a 2:30 movie.

Music composition throughout this movie, rarely we see guitars being used in movie scores. It felt fresh unique and something that he really likes, that blueish-rock sound (Walk the Line, Logan)

Idk how the audience got so lazy, I mean this movie isn't mad men or something that you need to over analyze to enjoy or understand, the visuals themselves along with the performances should be enough.  


I know I'm probably being rude by saying this, but it's really hard to believe that someone missed that point about the character and situation, you literally had a really tense scene, and bale's expression clearly showed that he went from selfish (laughing and singing) to thinking about being a teamplayer, to then slowing down and making that decision as the scene has that peaceful zoom out while the sound fades at the same time.",dvu5es

I guess having Shelby be: ""The only American to win Le Mans in a car other than a Ferrari"" would be needlessly convoluted.

She has a line in there which is something to the effect of: ""I don't care whether you decide to race again or not, so long as you stop hiding what you feel."" 

I did think it seemed out of character at first (especially when Ken mentions that he's being offered a shit ton of money and that's what seems to make her calm down) but on reflection this moment actually worked for me, and it emphasises that Mollie and Ken's relationship is very much a two way thing; it's not just Mollie supporting Ken, she wants to be confided in, she wants him to be honest so she can help him, and figure out how they're going to be able to make ends meet.

Shelby and co. tape bits of cotton wool all over the car to visually demonstrate the issue out on track at high speed. (These days Formula One teams use a special type of paint called ""flow-vis"" which does the same job of highlighting aerodynamic issues by visually showing where the air is going across the car) Now that both sides are in agreement as to the nature of the problem, they can fix the aero to iron it out, thereby making it go faster.

In fairness though the story of the 1976 F1 season and especially Lauda's comeback from a near-fatal accident lends itself way more naturally to a biopic than the Ford/Ferrari rivalry, so kudos to the filmmakers of Ford V Ferrari for still making it incredibly enjoyable.

I enjoyed the film thoroughly until that point and wish it would have ended with the race. I felt when the movie tried to get more emotional with Miles death and the ensuing scene with Shelby and Miles son that it kind of came up short? Maybe I'm the only one but his death felt rushed and lacked depth with that quote being read by Shelby as Miles died. Then the conversation with Miles' son and the wrench just tried to send some sort of bigger message about the film but it just didn't work for me. By the end Shelby puts his sunglasses on and speeds off and a rather uplifting song plays and I just sat there confused as to how I was supposed to feel because that last scene didn't resolve or really deal with anything other than reminding Miles' son that his father was a good man but he is certainly dead.

f7l4crl,"The main thing that annoys me about Miles being left out for Le Mans '65 in favour of American driver Bob Bondurant (Apart from the fact that in reality there were more than enough GT40's for both of them to take part) is the implication that Bondurant was forced upon Shelby by Ford. Bondurant had been part of Shelby's team since '63, and in '65 he even won the sportscar manufacturers' world championship for Shelby and Ford. I liked the scene itself though because it was great at getting us into Ken's headspace; it's true that some of the execs didn't like him, but they knew how good he was and wouldn't have stopped him taking part. They have to simplify the narrative though, and I get that they didn't want the film to take us to Le Mans until the 3rd act. Bondurant is still very much alive today actually, and I'd be interested to find out what he thinks of that scene if he's seen the movie.

To be honest there's so little of Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon in the film that I didn't really feel angry at their portrayal; they kind of just show up at the end when Miles slows down. Chris Amon before his death a few years ago said in interviews that Miles disobeyed the team's instructions to ease off and overtook McLaren, and that was what caused Ford to employ the dead heat and call off the race, because Miles wouldn't do as he was told. So he had mixed feelings about it; as a racing driver, he wanted to race, but he felt that it did sort of put things back the way they should have been had Miles obeyed instructions like all the other Ford cars did. Miles was also good friends with McLaren, and I wish they had shown Miles giving him a bear hug on the podium, even after feeling he was screwed out of the win, he didn't hold it against McLaren.

I think Miles' race engineer Charlie Agapou was one of the main consultants on the movie, and he always disputed claims that Miles disobeyed team orders, maintaining that Miles did exactly as he was told and Ford screwed him over. Really, it depends which perspective you believe; I personally think the film could have made the team orders conflict way more interesting if they hadn't turned Beebe into a cartoon villain. But it's explicitly not a documentary; they had their angle and that's what they put on screen. The big problem is that most of the people who knew what really happened are not around anymore, and so we get conflicting accounts; even the race footage isn't all that helpful as it's hard to tell which is from what lap in a 360 lap race.",dvu5es

f7nigst,"I went to see the film with a close friend of mine, and she really enjoyed it. The moment that crystallised it for me was when Beebe first suggested the dead heat idea, and she muttered under her breath “No... You bastard!” IIRC when they cut to a reaction shot of Beebe after the race he isn’t exactly surprised or confused like everyone else is; he’s pretty happy and not conflicted at all. The only thing that doesn’t quite add up is: How does Beebe, the guy who knows next to nothing about racing, know that some obscure technicality will be invoked to break the tie? Maybe his original plan was to simply diminish Miles’ victory by forcing him to share it with the no. 2 car, and it just ended up working out even better than he’d hoped for...",dvu5es

f8sr8fs,"They would usually limit themselves on the straights so they wouldn't be at max rpm for such a long time every lap. The aluminum heads on the 427s they were talking about in the dyno scene were not very good and could not withstand long term high rpm operation well like the iron NASCAR heads. So they usually limited rpm to 6000ish on the Mulsane to reduce stress on the heads. So the drivers could push on to 7000 or even 8000 to make a pass, but they risked blowing it up every time they did. Which I thought they showed well. Each driver kept inching their engine higher until one of them rained parts, and the Ferrari gave up first. I too hate the cliche and it's usually bs. But here it actually had some precedent. Now the one that bugged the hell out of me was when he does decide to lift to let the others catch up, but he does so near max v on the straight when he had been pushing, so hes near max rpm in top gear, and downshifts before slowing, which would have immediately locked up the rear wheels and blown up the engine as that thing tried to catch up to a 7000 rpm 4-3 money shift.",dvu5es

Ferrari was so dominant in Formula 1 back then that it felt like they were fixing the result; a lot of fans accused them of killing the sport.

You could also argue that Miles himself was partly to blame for not easing off earlier in the race like the team instructed him to via pitboard, which was partly why Ford went for the dead heat in the first place; because Miles otherwise wouldn't do as instructed, so they had to call off the race completely to ensure he fell in line and didn't blow up the car pushing too hard.",dvu5es

I loved this film, if I COULD I'd see it a few more times. 👍",dvu5es
f7x1i10,"I agree that it's a tonal shift from most of what came before; >!there is the threat of death throughout, and that's established very much in the scene where Miles escapes from the fireball after the brake failure during testing. But I noticed that there were a lot of real life deaths that were cut from the film. Walt Hansgen for instance had a horrific crash during practice at Le Mans (Whilst trying to beat Miles' laptime) but for whatever reason the filmmakers decided not to include this, probably because of the long running time but also to keep the tone fairly light. (Although it does make me wonder why they went to the effort of introducing him in the scene at Daytona if they weren't going to cover his tragic passing, given that it was so close to the race at Le Mans.)!<

>!I did like how the ending showed Shelby, who is usually cool, calm and unflappable; the guy with a plan who keeps everything together, start to lose his control once his close friend died. He suffers with his guilt; he wanted to do right by his friend and he didn't get the chance to right the wrong done to him, which he feels complicit in. Miles' arc is definitely the feel-good one, whereas Shelby's is a tragedy.!<

>!One of the most moving things about racing documentaries I've watched is how those who knew the subject react when tragedy befalls them. For instance in the Senna documentary, when Ayrton Senna is killed at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, his native Brazil has a week long period of national mourning, and he's given a massive state funeral. In the Bruce McLaren documentary (McLaren is the guy that wins Le Mans instead of Miles thanks to the technicality) when Bruce dies in a testing accident at Goodwood in 1970, his tightly knit Kiwi team is absolutely devastated, and yet they come into work the next morning to build a new car to replace the fatal wreck, and carry on racing out of unwavering love and loyalty to their boss. Le Mans '66 focused mainly on Shelby; it felt like a very personal loss that he had never experienced before as a team boss, and thus he just didn't know how to deal with it. It was interesting seeing someone as experienced as Shelby was in motorsport struggling to come to terms in a sport where death was a regular occurrence at the time.!<

They wanted it to seem like they kept him out that first year, but in actuality he was in both year races before he passed.

I don't think that the film exaggerates Miles' impact at all, although I think Bruce McLaren was also instrumental and started development work a year before. McLaren made the car fast and competitive, but Miles's input helped to turn the GT40 into a winner that could go the distance and still blow everyone away.",dvu5es

I didn't think he was teasing her; he was keeping it from her because he thought that she would be happier if he didn't go back to racing. Mollie just wanted him to be honest and share what was going on with her rather than keeping her in the dark.

I think Mollie in real life (Somewhat understandably) did not like watching her husband race very often because she was very aware of the dangers involved, which is why throughout the movie she tries to protect Peter from seeing the more dangerous parts of the sport, although ultimately she realises she can’t, which is why they end up watching Le Mans 1966 on TV together. I think without Miles’ family being there to ground the film, his success would ring more hollow; in some ways Miles has a lot more to lose than Shelby because of his strong relationship with his family.

It's the youngest city in Europe. Nearly 40% of the population is under 25.

J.R.R Tolkein was born and raised in and around Birmingham, and a lot of the scenery in The Lord of the Rings is based on real places in Birmingham and the surrounding areas. The two towers, for example, are based on two actual towers in Birmingham, one of which is less than half a mile from my mum's house!

Ozzy Osbourne was born here.

We have more canals than Venice!

Cadbury's chocolate is from Birmingham, the first Cadbury factory was here, and is now an attraction called ""Cadbury World"" which you can go around on a tour and see how they make the chocolate, the history of chocolate, the history of Cadbury etc.

The accent Bale used in this film is definitely not his natural accent, and IMDB lists a dialect coach for him, so he obviously had some help in getting the accent down (like I said, the accent was very good, so money well spent!). He is from Wales, but his current accent is definitely not Welsh. Having listened to an interview with him recently, his accent just sounds sort of generic southern-English at this point, presumably from spending so much time overseas and doing so many different accents, it's kinda watered his accent down.",dvu5es

I remember also reading a book on the subject that adamantly claimed that Beebe set up the dead heat simply for a good photo, and that they had gotten the go-ahead from Le Mans before they even told the drivers to go for it - only to have that pulled at the last minute, leading into what then happened to Miles.

I think it’s a very difficult story to adapt into a biopic, (it was in development hell for 10 years) and all things considered, given how there are many aspects of the real life story that are convoluted/complicated to explain to an audience that knows nothing about motorsport, they did a good job condensing an iconic sports car rivalry about 24 hour endurance racing into a 2 and a half hour crowd-pleaser.

Now Ron Howard’s film Rush on the other hand, I feel is much closer to being a masterpiece; Daniel Bruhl gives an incredible performance as Niki Lauda, which I personally feel eclipses Christian Bale’s in Ford V Ferrari (Bruhl had the harder job as Lauda was very much alive and in the public eye at the time of the film’s release, but he still knocked it out of the park) there are less cliches, and although it’s about a rivalry, neither protagonist is made out to be the villain; the film lets the audience make up their own mind and shows both their flaws, warts and all. If you want an r-rated racing drama which has a much deeper dive into the character of its protagonists and how their rivalry with each other drove them to greater heights, then I would highly recommend Rush. (Peter Morgan, the guy who also wrote The Crown and Frost/Nixon, helmed the script and consulted Niki Lauda extensively for it) 

To be fair though, Rush is a very high watermark, and I think it’s amazing that Ford V Ferrari is as watchable as it is and has so far had success both commercially and critically, because Rush was promoted really badly in the United States; nobody saw it, and the same could very easily have happened to Ford V Ferrari had Disney not gotten behind it after purchasing Fox.",dvu5es

I'm not an American btw and I didn't watch this in US. Even in my theatre some of the audiences made audible remarks saying that the Italian racer cheated (especially that broken door lock scene).

f7lgnwe,"The racing scenes in LM66/FVF I think are more than a match; but Rush is overall IMHO the film that moved me the most as a drama, although that's not to say I didn't care about LM66. But I think it's hard to compare because Rush kind of knew it was gonna have a niche audience and very much played to it; here they play it a bit broader, going for more of a mainstream appeal. I don't think either of them went for the wrong approach; Ron Howard made an 15/R-Rated gritty warts-and-all depiction of Formula One in the 1970's, and James Mangold made a realistic but mostly quite light 12A/PG13 depiction of Sportscar racing in the 1960's.

f8mu598,"In normal conditions they might not press fully on the throttle every lap, but even in 'coasting mode' they'd still have about 80-90% throttle on. And at those speeds/revs there just wouldn't be the immediate responsiveness as it's often depicted in film.

Let's say you're in a 1960s car doing 200mph in top gear, and to sit there at that speed you're depressing the pedal about 90%. If you suddenly press even that last 10% (foot to the floor) the car would begin to pick up pace fairly gradually. This would be the case even for a tuned 7.0 litre car like the GT40. At higher speeds/gears all cars are fighting physics and engine limits that just wouldn't allow these cinematic flights of fancy.

If it's at 30mph in 2nd gear, and you suddenly mash the throttle, yes sure; you'd take off like rocket and probably get wheelspin. But not at 200mph in top gear.",dvu5es

But Beebe pushed on with his plan anyway.[36][41]

>At the last pit stop, the Mark IIs were still in front. Miles/Hulme were leading, followed by McLaren/Amon holding station on the same lap. The gold Bucknum/Hutcherson car was third, but twelve laps behind. Miles was told to ease off to allow McLaren to catch up with him. Just before 4pm, it started to drizzle again.

f8v3jxm,"It’s a bit weird because the film starts off with him driving for Shelby whilst working in his own garage, when in reality Ken started working for Shelby after the IRS had shut down his shop; Shelby was impressed by Ken as both a driver and mechanic, and Ken didn’t really have anywhere else to go. 

What’s key to remember is that corporate sponsorship back in the early 60’s did not exist in the same way that it does today; the idea of selling space on the car to sponsors was still a rarely seen novelty; brands sponsored the races, but not the teams. Shelby did not really have the money to sponsor Miles himself given that Shelby American was a small, specialised sportscar firm prior to being hired by Ford to work on the Le Mans effort. The film shows Shelby trying to persuade Dieter Voss to get Ken into a drive with Porsche early on, but Ken sabotages that by making a big scene. Ken then rules it out anyway because he is still resentful towards Germany due to his experience in WW2. (Which is odd, because in real life he did actually drive for Porsche for a few years in the 50’s...So perhaps Miles was more pragmatic in real life than in the film)",dvu5es
f88klsg,"Yeah, I would agree; one of the reasons I loved Rush (2013) so much is because it was a racing film about a rivalry, but it didn't make either side the villain; it was a ""warts and all "" approach, where they sort of showed the worst and best of both drivers. For me Beebe's motives felt a bit thin in the film, especially when compared to the real life figure. Henry Ford II and Beebe served in the trenches in WW2 together, and that's why he made Beebe his second in command. It would have been interesting if the film portrayed Ford/Beebe as a parallel pairing to Miles/Shelby, and they showed Beebe doing what he did out of respect and admiration for his boss and friend to try and do right by him and ensure that things don't go wrong again at Le Mans, rather than having him be purely motivated by his dislike of Miles' personality. Instead he just comes across as an untrustworthy confidante whom Ford only likes because he sucks up to him excessively.

f7l0bn7,"Well Daytona was just the complete wrong track. I get movie stuff so I just laughed but the track they were at is Auto Club Speedway.  Daytona looks much different than that. Then at Le Mans specifically they were getting gear changes, braking, accelerating, etc all wrong. Like on the straight you're not gonna be pushing the throttle more to pass someone. You're just flat the entire straight. The corner at the end of that straight is basically a hairpin where in today's modern cars they're braking at the 100 board. In the old cars they would've been braking much earlier. The Esses in the movie were basically flat but in the old days, it was a 2nd gear corner. It's stuff that has zero effect on how good the movie is but it's just stuff I was noticing because I'm A) More critical of racing movies so I nitpick & B) Knew the story so I wasn't as focused as my friends were on the story",dvu5es

f7z581d,There was a period of time in formula 1 where it was common for there to be at least 2 driver deaths in a season. It was so bad at one point that the pit crews and teams would purposefully avoid the drivers to not get close to them.,dvu5es
f7rl6tf,"They didn't. Here's the actual picture from the real race, that's McLaren at the front: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fhiWRTDZ7-E/maxresdefault.jpg

Based on who you ask, either McLaren sped up at the last minute, or Miles slowed down. McLaren, before his death, insisted that it was he who sped up to be first on the line, because Le Mans organizers had told everyone that they'd share the winning post. It was only after they had arrived that Le Mans changed their minds.",dvu5es

f9kde9d,"The two main crashes that are shown on screen for any extended amount of time aren't even that important to the story tbh, the first one is basically there to set the scene for his death at the end of the movie, and his death at the end of the movie happens when the movie is pretty much already over. If you could find a way to cut them out or just watch in advance and note when the crashes happen to skip ahead of them, you can skip them entirely and it won't really affect the experience.

Actually if you remember this comment by the time you're considering watching this, so you don't have to watch the whole thing before watching it with him just leave a reply here or a DM and let me know what online source you're using to watch the movie and I'll find all the crashes and let you know the exact time stamps to skip. You can probably get through the whole movie without seeing any explosions, and especially without seeing the scenes where someone is in a burning car, shouldn't really be hard.",dvu5es

fdi4jlm,"Very generous! You also raise an important point about this film: Despite there being many actual crashes and retirements in the Le Mans race in real life that year, this film only acknowledges two that I can remember.

fmgobrt,"Okay so what scenes in this movie depict that? Besides the obvious one with Jon Berthal (who barely has any lines in the rest of the movie).

I dont think Matt Damon has any interaction what so ever with Ferrari. He does how ever have 2 scenes where he has to convince Ford in a big way that he should have control of the team. 1. After their first loss Ford gives him completely control (which he some how loses). 2. When he takes him for that really fast ride that makes him cry. 2 scenes leading to the same thing. 

So how many scenes do we have that puts Ford against Ferrari? Not the back story. Not the ""I looked this up so I know what it is"". In this movie.",dvu5es

So true. If you go to the ""shoreline"" parts of Portugal, yeah, you got plenty of amazing fish to eat. In the ""middle"" of the country, where I'm from, pork meat is way more common.

fmisp1m,"I guess I am clueless to you're point then. Do you seriously suggest the movie should have been called ""Ford vs. Ford""? I don't think that would be a good name for this film. There were politics and conflict within Ford but ultimately the whole company was united by their effort to win at Le Mans by beating Ferrari. This episode of history is remembered more for the battle between the two companies than the conflicts within them. I know in other countries it was called ""*Le Mans '66*"", but that's not a great name unless you're marketing to an audience that already knows what happened at Le Mans in 1966 (that is to say, it's a bad name for a movie released in North America).",dvu5es
fmiup0c,"Ford vs Ford was a sarcastic comment on the fact that it was barely about their fight with Ferrari. This movie was 2 plus hours long and if it wasnt in the title I wouldnt have thought they really gave a fuck about Ferrari. They were just a catalyst to get them to le mans.

I can only assume you are trolling at this point.",dvu5es
