fizxkcq,"The way characters move out of frame and the camera stays still, or when the camera shoots an empty corner, that puts me on edge.

The restaurant scene, holy shit so fast your brain needs a second to process what just happened.

Loved the ending, the movie definitely exceed my expectations.",fafwsf
fizddbg,"The best part about the sister scene - probably the best jump scare I've seen in a long time - was how the trailer was edited to hide it. It edits together the scene where she's waving the knife around and the scene where she gets arrested to make you think it happens after she waves a knife around her friend's place. Then the movie happens and it's much, much worse.",fafwsf

If i received an email like that from my sister, I’d text her asking, “w’sup with that email?”

She’d prolly be like, “what email?” And I’d tell her to check her sent and she’d get back to me like, “lol wtf I didn’t send that.” And I’d be like, “lol yeah, thought so. Change your password or some shit.”",fafwsf

fize1hk,"Haven’t felt this consistently on-edge by a movie in a very long time. Elisabeth Moss has so many standout moments, and the ending was really satisfying in how it all came together. Also love how long the shots lasted at times and how the camera would bring you around the different rooms. You really felt the spaces.

One thing I didn’t get/seemed lazy on the screenwriting front: how did Adrian fake his suicide? Like, did he make a replica corpse or what?",fafwsf
fizqa5b,"I usually hate, *hate*, **hate**, jump scares. I feel like they’re cheating akin to tickling someone when you tell them a bad joke to get them to laugh.

**However,** I loved the attic paint-in-face scene jump scare. The initial shock followed by the dread that he was that close, watching menacingly, and we couldn’t see it was amazing. Supplemented by the backstory so you know who it is and what his intentions are? Truly well done. *That* is how jumps should be done in all movies.

The tension throughout the movie was amazing and they really masterfully conveyed the horror of the “he could be anywhere, even standing right in front of us, and we wouldn’t know.”",fafwsf
fizi3sh,"When the sister saw the floating knife...nobody was ready for that. 

Really loved what Whannell did with this, and I thought its twist of The Invisible Man being a narcissistic gaslighter worked surprisingly well for a modern adaptation.

fj0ijc6,I like that they chose not to do flashbacks of the abusive relationship. Moss sold that turmoil with just her acting. God damn she was good.,fafwsf
fj4nt6f,"I think using the term “jump scares” to describe moments in this movie does a slight disservice to the actual scares in the movie, meaning these aren’t the cheap “dark figure crosses the foreground of the camera with an orchestral hit” kinda of jump scares that rely on editing or compositional gags.

They are legitimate scares inspired by the film’s well crafted anxiety and sudden turnabouts and reveals (the paint, the floating knife) and not cheap gotcha gimmicks that traditionally fall under the “jump scare” trope definition.",fafwsf

I wasn't familiar with the original book/movie, but the concept seemed simple enough.

*That* paint scene was pretty fucking intense",fafwsf
fj2k61r,Blumhouse **needs** to do a low-budget reboot of the entire Dark Universe.,fafwsf
fjmn51z,"That was a really solid horror. The camera work was nothing short of genius. The way the camera will deliberately move to show seemingly empty space really puts the viewer in the mind of the character. The camera is pointed at an empty corner, and we can see that there's nothing there, but why are we seeing it if there's nothing there? At one point, the camera *rack focuses to nothing*, and it's brilliant.

The last act was really something else. I loved how the movie was willing to have fun enough to give the Invisible Man a Marvel-style hallway fight, just to show how OP invisibility would be even in straight combat.

Oh yeah, and Elizabeth Moss was incredible, and she carries the film, put Elizabeth Moss in more things.

That said, there are some glaring flaws. Cecilia's sister gets a weird e-mail that Cecilia denies sending, and she immediately cuts ties to her? That's not how sisters work. Like, I buy that the sister would be upset by the e-mail, but it would be ""Hey, what the fuck is up with this e-mail?"" ""I didn't send that."" ""Okay, didn't think so. Change your password."" And don't tell me their relationship wasn't that good. The sister drove out into the middle of nowhere at 4am with no context to pick Cecilia up. *That's* what sisters do. Leigh Whannell is an only child.

The character of Tom really seemed to convolute the story, and also cheapen the core idea a little bit. I don't think the Invisible Man should have a Visible Representative.

The law in this Universe is like ""So Adrian Griffin killed himself. He definitely killed himself, no need to investigate or nothing. Also, his girlfriend is clearly crazy because she says he's invisible and is stalking her. As if anybody is crazy enough to believe the genius engineer in the field of optics who's basement is full of suits that make you invisible -which there is zero chance nobody knew about- could somehow turn invisible. Oh wait, nevermind, he was alive the whole time and his *brother* somehow built an invisibility suit, unconnected to aforementioned invisibility suits. So he's fine and off the hook for the Invisible Crimes and no further investigation is need.""

Also Aldis Hodge looks like somebody gave steroids to a monster truck. I don't buy that the Invisible Man beat him in a hand-to-hand fight, invisibility or no. He would punch the air until the air started bleeding.

Anyway, really good film. Loses a couple points for weird problems. 7/10.",fafwsf
fizki0o,It was great but the after credit scene where Russell Crowe and Tom Cruise show up and give Moss a picture of Benecio Del Toro left me feeling kind of funny. “Time to hunt the Wolf.”,fafwsf
fizepb3,"Fantastic. Really loved it. I loved how the suit was both a reference to modern-day stealth suits and Argus (Greek God of Surveillance). The Invisible Man might be from an old book, but he is absolutely a relevant villain in 2020. Most women I know have had a stalker at some point (I had two when I was a kid), and this totally captures the fear, dread, mind-games and gaslighting the experience can have. The true horror wasn't even the big flashy things - it was an e-mail sent in your name that attacked the bonds you had with your family, putting the lives of people who reach out to help you at risk so you self-isolate, it was the way your attacker obsesses over an idea of possessing you - very, very good.

And I have to say, strangely accurate to the Wells book. It's been a long time since I read it, but this Griffin was a lot like that Griffin, but with a more modern understanding of narcissism and how the abuse of technology can go even further than that when it comes to violating people.",fafwsf

Adrian was supposed to have complete control over her and have all these cameras and security measures how did he not know about the hiding spot?!?!?

But then I realized she was an architect and I’m pretty sure the drawings that were shown as her previous work looked like Adrians house. Did she design Adrians house and put a hiding space in it in case she ever needed it?!?!? Can someone confirm this????

Only those close to her call her Cee (see).

At least if they mentioned the place had no cameras I would have been satisfied, but after that it’s all I could think about.

Definitely one of the more creative horror movies in a long time, I’d definitely recommend it.",fafwsf
frqtiew,I know I’m late to this party but I think it’s hilarious that once the police are involved and are made aware of the existence of an invisibility suit that the federal government WOULDNT have disappeared everybody and every piece of evidence.

This guy could have effectively named his price but instead he blows it all up on a late 30’s housewife with weird eyes.,fafwsf
g2ap8gc,"I loved it. I took it at face value and I thought it was an extremely well done thriller. Sure there are plot holes, and things that don’t really make sense (the fact that he basically had superhero strength when he was fighting all those guards, lol). I was basically on the edge of my seat the whole time and thought it was super entertaining!",fafwsf
fj6mt5o,"To me the reason why this film is so captivating and terrifying is not due to having an antagonist wearing an invisible suit, but due the fact that it depicts an abusive relationship quite accurately. Cecilia was gaslighted, isolated, constantly put under both emotional and physical pressure while seemingly without ways to escape her abuser; the above description can be used to describe many real life scenarios regarding the relationship between victims of abuse and their abusers. 

When I was watching the film, I wasn't focused on the sci fi and physical violence aspects of horror, but I was way more affected by the cognitive empathy I had for Cecilia herself. Unlike many horror movies where the struggle of the characters appears to be out of this world and completely removed from reality, Cecilia's torment seems to be so realistic and can be experienced by anyone, including ourselves and those that are close to us. 

I don't simply view Adrian as a man in an invisible suit, but the manifestation of the violence and threat that loom over victims of abuse. Even without a suit of invisibility, the abuser can still have the same type of control and adverse effects  on the victims; what the movie did was to simply amplify the effect and the stake by adding in an element of science fiction. To me, the appeal of the film is about how realistic it is, and how the superpowered suit and excessive violence did not derail the realistic depiction of a violent and abusive relationship, which is a type of terror that exists around us.",fafwsf

&#x200B;

1. Cecilia calls Tom a jellyfish due to his ""lack of a spine"". When Sydney is being attacked by the invisible man, she has a jellyfish on her shirt (as likened to Zora having a rabbit on her shirt in Us) which immediately led me to believe Tom was in fact attacking her and James.

fn0x1c4,"I came here being a bit annoyed by like one or two scenes in this film (for example the damn phone full of evidence) only to find people here shitting on the film for absolutely nonsense reasons. Like, it's like people didn't even watch it.

The suit obviously gave the wearer extra strength. Adrian lifted a full-grown woman several feet off the ground with one hand. He knocked out full grown-men with one punch. The fact that Cecilia could use the suit to overpower him at the end makes perfect sense.

The dog surviving? Clearly Adrian and Tom were both still around and in the house. They could easily feed a dog. And It's a house in the middle of nowhere with a goddamn wall protecting it. No one's gonna just stumble in and see a dog. 

Adrian seemed nice at the end and not at all like she described him (for example letting her decide what to eat). Yeah, no shit. That's textbook abusive behavior. He wants her back, so he pretends to be a changed man.",fafwsf

fj1spbs,"The only thing I didn't understand was after her sister's murder in the restaurant... wouldn't the cops ask for video footage from the restaurant to see exactly what happened? Any detectives who know what they're doing would ask to see evidence. Maybe Tom tampered with the security cameras before or after the fact, but the film didn't show that, so the audience is just left to assume that video footage still existed. So essentially they were just going off the idea that Cecilia sent her sister an email saying she wanted to kill her, and she was holding a knife at the restaurant after her sister's throat was slit, and so she must be the murderer.

Um, maybe look at the security cameras to make sure? Policing 101 here.",fafwsf

Also after the scene where she was cutting her arm in the shower, she had no consequences from that at all. Looked to be a pretty deep cut over a vein and she wasn't even bleeding / in pain besides the 3 seconds before she was grabbed.

Similar to Shutter Island or Fight Club, where you see hallucinations from the perspective of the main character. I thought maybe they'd end up showing us that even the stuff in the kitchen was actually her doing. It would have been pretty morbid to see her slashing her sisters neck across the restaurant table (from a sane persons perspective), as well as hitting that girl. The moment Adrian's brother arrived at the hospital to offer her a deal to raise her child though... that's where I realised I need to just take the movie at face value. Regardless, I thought it was absolutely brilliant, and will likely watch it again in the future.",fafwsf
fj93vqo,"Saw it tonight. Thought it was great. Never had any doubt in Leigh Whannell to be honest but glad I didn't watch anything more than the teaser. Even it gave away too much.    

I liked the modern grounded take on the indivisibility. I am so sick of brilliant scientist turned mad because of some experiment like hollow man. I liked that it was >!tech!< that made the invisible man.     

I also enjoyed that it wasn't voyeuristic or sleazy, like Hollow Man was. Which is a good movie in its own right. But I like that this is a story of abuse and gaslighting told fairly straight. Its very easy with invisible man stories to play into the voyeuristic fantasy so I like that this went more of the traditional thriller/horror route with it. In fact the movie mostly could still work if you take away the invisibility aspect. An obsessive ex boyfriend with a lot of money could probably still mess her life up just as much.     

Elizabeth Moss was terrific, that girl can play crazy.     

I loved the wide angle shots, I was so anxious just waiting for something to move or give us a sign he was there.    

>!Also great use of ""show, don't tell"". Leigh Whannell trusted the audience to ""get"" the tech in it. We didn't get some big exposition scene explaining how the invisibility worked. We see a brief pan of his workshop in the opening, which shows us he is building something and then when it is finally revealed its done so in a way to simply convey to the audience how it works. I loved that. I wish more movies would do this. Not everything has to be spelt out for us. It was beautiful.!<    

It's not a perfect film, and super easy to poke holes in but it's a movie about an invisible man. You have to let things slide.",fafwsf

fizddbx,"Man, this movie was really good. Just super tight. Intense, scary, timely, psychological, really well shot and acted. I had heard it was quite good and I was still pretty surprised. 

Moss puts forward a hell of a performance. Considering half the movie is her reacting to negative space she is really carrying this thing on her shoulders and it looks pretty effortless.

 I appreciated how right off the bat in the first scene, her entire plan relies on being able to see him with her camera. We are instantly told how dangerous he is and the focus of the ability to see him without him doing anything. 

Really enjoyed the way of framing the story of the invisible Man as an abusive narcissist. Super frightening to imagine what such an intelligent abuser could do if they terrorize a single person. The ways he compartmentalized her from her family and friends, set her up to be framed. Absolutely frightening when he killed her sister, kind of a moment where you realize she's really helpless and totally fucked. 

I loved the camera work. It focused on the negative space in such a great way that the scenes were all suspenseful even if there was nothing on screen to make it so. Really impressive to craft so many scenes where the same thing is happening and make them each unique and scary. 

I was really happy with the ending. I know it kind of turns into a revenge thriller, but so much of the movie felt so helpless that I honestly thought she was gonna give him his final fuck you through suicide. Even after she was out of the hospital and he's still controlling the narrative. I liked how he never actually admitted it was him. It leaves a bit of doubt in the cop character but and forces him to ask himself is he believes her. 

And that's what this is all about. We see that she's telling the truth but imagine being in such a mental prison that no one would even believe you. That your abuser is walking free in daylight and no one will just give you the benefit of the doubt. The themes were so well portrayed I would almost consider this more of a drama than a horror. 

Easy 8/10. High quality stuff, would recommend.

g1dmbme,"I find it very convenient that that super tight suit fits all three characters without a problem. If you watch the scene where Cecilia is removing the suit from the lab, you can see the suit had a thick and not so flexible fabric and was custom made to fit Adrian's body. How did she manage to put it herself? Only putting a diving suit is something that requires some struggle, I can't imagine trying to wear one that doesn't fit my body type at all and then remove it all again to then put on a dress and pretend nothing happened. I would be sweating like a pig, gasping for air and my hear would be all over the place. 

Also if Adrian was so controlling and abusive, how come he showed her all the passwords to access the security of his apt and lab? Specially knowing she was lying to him (about the birth control). It doesn't make any sense.",fafwsf

After watching it’s pretty obvious that the question of whether or not she’s actually crazy isn’t a question the movie is asking (Case in point: the first noticeable examples that someone is actually there occur when he’s fucking with the stove and the breath outside, things Cecelia doesn’t even see).",fafwsf

He came off as such a genuine character you could relate to. The actress for the daughter was also amazing too with the way she reacted to everything. The pepper spray scenes got a lot of laughs in the theater I was in.

The portrayal of abuse and gaslighting was honestly too realistic for me in certain scenes and I loved that they never explicitly showed what happened to Moss before she left.

flq6r6h,"I thought the concept was interesting, and the editing was great - felt like the sort of movie that Hollow Man could/should have been. 

But some parts of it fell a bit flat; mostly the heavy emphasis on security cameras which never got brought up when it mattered, like in the restaurant - there wasn't really an opportunity for any of the characters to really *try* and trust the main character, which I can't help but feel would have made it more believable, especially since >!it finishes with her saying ""welp, he *killed himself*! *WINK!*"" and his reaction is basically ""I'm a cop, but... I guess so! *WINK!*"" it was just a bit jarring compared to the rest of the film that had up to that point provided a great sense of isolation.!<

Overall it was worth the watch though - felt like it achieved a huge amount of suspense without resorting to cheap tricks, and the use of simple camera work and holding shots after characters leave the scene worked really well.",fafwsf

At the very least we should hear grunts when he gets pots and plates broken over his head. I would expect some expletives too out of him.

At first I was like ""well maybe you can't talk in the suit because it covers your mouth"" but then he talks in the parking lot of the mental hospital.

My only other idea was that it was Tom and so he didn't want to speak to give away that it wasn't Adrian? But then that cheapens... pretty much everything else-Like the attic phone with pictures of her sleeping.",fafwsf

fvicsz1,There were so many unanswered questions. Her relationship to James and his daughter was never defined. How did she know them? At first I assumed he was her brother in law but he wasn't. Why would the doctor not tell her she was pregnant?  That makes no sense. How did Adrian fake his death and not be charged?  And how was he able to fake his death? He didn't go missing. The brother showed pictures of Adrian's so called dead body.  She got 5 million from his estate. He was a rich brilliant scientist. People knew him. How did he even create the suits without his people knowing?  Her friend James would not have been involved in her case. Conflict of interest. Also the police would know about the suit and his hands didn't move. I guess the cameras in the restaurant wasn't working that day?  So many questions. 🤯,fafwsf

1. Her sister and her were obviously close that's why she drove out to the middle of nowhere in the middle of night to pick her up. Yet she was so shocked by that email instead of asking her what that was about she just said she needed medication.


2. Wouldn't there have been camera footage at the restaurant? It looked pretty high class and that cop got there SUPER quick. Almost like he was eating at a nearby table.


3. How did she pepper pray him through the suit?


4. I am surprised Adrian wiped paint off his suit in like .5 seconds. And why wouldn't the cop check the attic when he got home and saw paint all over his floor, a ladder, and his attic open?


5. If they found him locked in his basement, they would have investigated the fake suicide. But they just glossed over that and he got cleaned up and got his house ready for his bae.

fovsozi,"Up until the end i'd rate it maybe 8/10. Some questionable moments, like washing paint off your high tech suit with water, but i can get past it. 

Then the ending happened. I fucking hated the ending.

The whole movie all we hear about Adrian is that he's smart and manipulative and controlling and violent and cold and horrible. He's apparently been controlling what Cecilia can do and say, and is horribly abusive. He punched through a car window when she ran away, so ya we can assume he might be violent.

Then the movie ends with Cecilia trying to force Adrian to say something that may well not be true as far as we know, and when he doesn't she kills him, fake cries for a camera and then coldly stares as him while he dies.

I immediately lost all sympathy for her. I know the movie was trying to show that he's not overtly abusive, but he knows what to say and do to make her behave how he wants her to and was trying to take control again. Problem is, telling someone you're not a murderer and comforting them when they get upset is not abusive, even if you do put your hand on their knee and say ""surprise"" in a sentence. Whereas Cecilia embodied everything she claimed Adrian to be in that scene.

I was ready for either a full confession and violent outbreak from Adrian, or for Cecilia to be so traumatized by events that she can't let go of the idea that Adrian is behind everything bad that happens to her even though she can't prove it. Instead it's revealed that Cecilia is a very cold person and a convincing liar. She's a psychopath. It left me questioning her character, and wondering if she was lying about the abuse the entire time. All the while the camera is holding on her trying to look vindicated, like she's the hero in spite of what just happened.",fafwsf
fizpn9p,"Wow. Totally blown away by how good this was. I hope Bloomhouse tackles all of the Universal Monsters if this is how they plan on adapting them.

This was unbearably tense at points. I loved how the movie feels like it's backing you into a corner. In many horror movies I find myself wondering why the main characters don't just do this or that. Not here. The level of gaslighting and mental torture Cecillia goes through just makes you want to throw your hands up at some point and give up.

As many have said the sister restaurant scene was the highlight and Elisabeth Moss killed it.",fafwsf

Only issue I had was it felt about 15 minutes too long, I think keeping the suspense going would’ve been a little more impactful, but I totally see why the director chose to end it the way he did.

fj1g17k,"I think this film was great for the depiction of ptsd after leaving an abusive relationship. The feelings and sensations she’s going through (up until he punches Sydney) are so completely relatable.

There is a mental hold and you feel like their presence is inescapable. You’re super isolated (because they made you that way) you’re going to have night terrors that are hard to wake up from. It’s incredibly hard to shake the feeling that they’re right there watching you, laughing at you.

Just came back from seeing it and my god...blew me away! Her acting alone...just beyond words.

The score was incredible. The paint scene got me so badly because this sense of sudden doom around it; it wasn't a jump scare, just this awful, sudden sense of panic seeing how close he was to her and the music that boomed.

This movie was tense from the very opening scene of her rushing around his house in silent terror until the very end. Seeing her get her power back. 

Just overall such a great film, looking forward a rewatch already...the hopelessness you felt for her and my god, the dinner scene...


My local theater is notorious for having shitty people in there laughing and joking, but we risked going just praying they'd be quiet lol....the cinema was packed and yet you could've heard a pin drop during the entire thing, the tension there was palpable.

Such smart filmmaking too with the low but perfectly used budget and the obvious brilliant idea of setting this in the context of a woman being stalked by an abusive lover. Just brilliant and really well done all around. Elizabeth Moss keeps knocking it out of the park. (Watch Her Smell if you haven't.)

Those lingering pan shots of *nothing* had me almost laughing out loud at how the movie can be so tense and give the viewer so much anxiety while spending virtually no money and being so much more effective than most other similar films out there.

When James arrives to the scene of Adrian's death and sees that Cecillia has the invisibility suit he knows that she killed Adrian. What I am wondering is does James look afraid of Cecillia. Does he agree with her assessment ""you heard him right?"" because he is afraid of the repercussions he could face with her in control of the other suit?

But apparently things were bad enough between them for her sister to read an email full of hate and vitriol and just accept that she wrote it, even when she says she didn't. It's like a half hour was cut from the beginning where the movie shows us how they met, how bad he became, and how it affected her relationship with her sister to such a degree.

How the hell did they see or breath in those masks though? Was it like some weird Iron Man helmet situation going on there? It made the breath scene and the pepper spray scene a bit weird. 

How many people saw him grabbing the knife from the counter in the beginning when she was cooking? I saw it, but my husband didn't notice, so I'm curious how many caught that. They should add that question to the poll! 

I also guessed right before they took the mask off that it was gonna be the brother under there. I actually expected the movie to end there, so I was pleasantly surprised when it kept going. 

I think my favorite scene is when he pulls the covers off the bed. It made it really feel like a ghost story in that moment, and the footsteps on the sheet was just the icing on the cake.

The apparent hopelessness of the situation was palpable, and while I saw it at a matinee where barely anyone else was present, I heard people reacting vocally, and I did a couple of times too. The subtext here is obvious but, more importantly, it's BROADLY relatable, and it's not often it gets tackled in this sleek a way by pros. 

I feel like I'm supposed to hate Elizabeth Moss because of the particular religious cult she's a part of, but, Moss has really flexed and impressed me recently, with this, her memorable role in the if-underwhelming Us, and esp.

1.the sister literally didn’t even question the email. even when the email said “i never want to see you again” and her sister shows up at her door acting like that never happened would be at least a bit suspicious. at the very least i would think my sister had schizophrenia

So how in the world would she be able to get away with Adrian “killing himself” moments after she walked into his house? Don’t the cops know the suit exists? Wouldn’t they investigate her as the only witness? After which they would find the invisibility suit that she’s not even hiding well in her bag.

She was leaving with the suit so it was implied that she had done it. 

But after the throat slit scene, she came out of the other room way too quickly and the timing for some reason just felt off. That's how I felt.

Loved the callbacks to classic invisible Man with the outfit on the mannequin, and the bandaged guy in the hospital. 

Really liked that they eliminated the possibility of Celia just being crazy by having the Stover burner turn up while she was gone. 

Only have two complaints: who was feeding this dog in the abandoned house this whole time?

The restaurant scene is just awesome: the ""we do things different here"" waiter, the massive surprise after you think she's going to get help, the slow realization on the other lady's face of what happened, Cecilia going into complete shock.

-If Adrian was indeed kidnapped, how did he explain faking his own death to the police? 

-After the kitchen fire was put out, why didn't Cecilia realize the knife she was just using to cut vegetable was missing? The partially cut vegetables were still on the cutting board. A normal person would've gone back to it to put away the knife and likely clear the board since breakfast was ruined. Nope, yada-yada moving on.

-How is Adrian not making a sound when he walks around? Not one floor in any of the places makes a creak under the weight of a grown man?

-Why did Cecelia not keep the phone to show James the pictures that she obviously didn't take. Plus, idk Adrian's phone? In the house? Dir evidence. 

-Why did she feel the need to take the knife out of the plastic bag. Better yet, why did Adrian even put it in there?

-How the hell did Adrian manage to wash off paint from a suit made of thousands of camera using a kitchen sink? Quickly as well.

-Were there no cameras in the restaurant showing a floating knife killing the sister?

-Where'd he get the huge knife? Certainly wasn't on a table for customers drinking water. How'd he get the knife in her hand so fast? Any why did she close her fingers around it and continue to hold it? 

-Why did she think telling cops Adrian was invisible would go anywhere? Is she truly an idiot?

-Adrian had no idea of the obvious hiding spot in his own closet? He saw her bring it in and walk out without it. A few minutes searching and he would've found it.

-Were there no cameras in the mental hospital? I think not. Why did the security guard aim his gun at Cecilia when she was down the hall when he saw his partner get beat up? Several eye witnesses and she's still under investigation?

-Why does rain not make the suit easier to see? He's a physical object which means droplets will bounce off and show his silhouette. Nope. I guess rain is phasing through him.

-Why isn't the CIA investigating Adrian after they have proof of an invisibility suit? All the proof from the scenario I described previously. Even a broken suit shows advanced technology that requires investigation.

-Why does Cecilia think walking away and leaving Adrian's body will help her look and less suspicious? Idiot needs to stay with Adrian crying until the ambulance arrives.

One nitpick. The ending did feel a bit abrupt, I would’ve happily sat through another 20 minutes in order to have a more fleshed out finale but it in no way sucked, it didn’t ruin the movie at all.

Why didn't she ask Tom how he knew where she was to send the letter?

Were there seriously no cameras in the restaurant?

Why were James and Sydney so quick to turn on Ce? I get that they thought Ce hit her, but she's suddenly getting violent and acting entirely out of character and that's your first reaction? It seemed out of character for them both.

Why couldn't James look more into the police reports on Adrian's ""death""... if they existed? Furthermore they're just like ""Yup, turns out he was alive the whole time. Isn't that a hoot?"". Like, there's no question about how and why his death was faked?",fafwsf

Also, they have to know about the suit now. A bunch of people saw the flickering suit at the hospital, and Adrian's brother was killed in it, so I'm sure they have an understanding of the suit and all. Now, suddenly he kills himself in the 3 minutes that she leaves the room? That all seems very suspicious. I liked it, but there are just a few plot holes that don't work for me.

apparently the cameras record the surroundings and then displays the surroundings on the surface of the suit. pretty sure if an observer moves, even slightly, while looking at the same patch of the suit, it will immediately look wrong. 

even if the cameras also track eye movements and therefore adjust the displayed graphics, this would fall apart when there are multiple observers.  for example, the multiple cops in the corridor, the people in the restaurant, and whenever we see the scene through cctv as well as individuals. 

==

also, a number of forensics/tests could have done to rule in/out whether adrian was involved. but i suppose that's too tedious.

the invisible man at the police station is probably tom, because we see him drive away presumably to the james household. on the off chance he was not, check tom's body. if he didnt have stab wounds but adrian did, mystery solved.

I did not see the sisters death coming at all either, completely took me by surprise.

&#x200B;

that said the movie still super frustrating at times

like when the daughter was all ""*she hit me!*""  bitch how?!?? she was 3ft away and laying down, and you got knocked in a different direction.

the same goes for the whole hospital scene, where a guard gets knocked down 20 feet away from her, and the other guard sees all this and still thinks she did it, before adrian appears out thin air, punches him and vanishes again, and the guard still blames her!

and then the detective dude is like ""a couple guards saw some weird stuff but we don't what happened"". motherfucker:

1. you just beat up by an invisible man, infront of your daughter who ""saw"" the whole thing,
2. there are like 8 guards who saw a man appear out thin air and then vanish again, saw guns floating, doors opening by themselves, etc
3. there's a dead guy wearing a suit covered in cameras and screens sitting in your living room, we're just going to pretend we don't know what it does, so that you can talk down to the woman who saw the whole thing.

what the actual fuck?

The execution is perfect. We're lulled into a sense of safety and protection because we've been conditioned to believe the trope of ""public space means you're safe"". Emily (please fix the cast list: Harriet Dyer plays Emily, not Alice, Kass) is willing to listen to Cecelia, who desperately needs her. As Em starts to understand what Cee is explaining, Em's eyes shift away from her sister because she sees something strange. We see what Em sees: a knife just chilling in the air. It lingers there for a beat: long enough for Cee to see what we see. In that split second, I thought about how The Invisible Man was gonna mess with the sisters here and then \*throat slice*. Before we can process wtf just took place, the knife is in Cee's hand. 

I was absolutely shook. 

The sound is distorted and someone notices the aftermath of a murder. Mayhem ensues but we're in the same state as Cee: unable to believe what just happened. Her sister was killed, and she was framed for it.

I'll end up rewatching this movie a handful of times just for this scene. I was so incredibly tense throughout my first watch but, this time, I was able to fully appreciate the filmmaking and storytelling. It's also fun to hear all the gasps and witness the audience reactions: the word-of-mouth seems to be very positive!",fafwsf

fjcieqh,"I enjoyed this movie but I have a question about Adrian. Wouldn’t he have known that the second suit was missing? And wouldn’t he have looked for it? And then wouldn’t he have found it, spoiling Cecilia’s plan, or not found it and known that she had the upper hand in that way?",fafwsf
fjg6xb9,"Does the suit give super strength ? It looks like it does throughout the whole movie he lifts her with one hand, how the first cop with the taser gets overpowered and when she forces him to cut his own throat while he was able to pick her up so easily earlier in the movie ?",fafwsf
fjgaf59,If Adrian was 'locked in his basement' he wouldn't have known about the baby. So couldn't Cecilia have used it as a way to test if he was the invisible Man or not? If she kept it quiet/got an abortion there's no way he would not bring it up at some point.,fafwsf
fjisvct,"I thought the movie was amazing in spite of some plot holes and logical inconsistencies, but there's one issue I haven't seen anyone bring up yet. During the opening scene when Cecelia goes into Adrien's lab we hear muffled noises. We later hear the same muffled noises again when she goes back to the lab and finds the suit. Presumably those noises were meant to be Adrien struggling when we was ""trapped"" below as he's found near the end. But then why did we hear them at the beginning when Adrien was still in the bed?",fafwsf
fjkr5xr,"Didn’t hate the movie. When all the stuff happening is bottled into the house that’s fine. I guess he could get away with it. 

And maybe I’m crazy and constantly paranoid. But the way the girl and Cecilia were sitting there’s no way I would have believed she was fast enough to hit me at the force and angle she got hit at and then some how magically stayed in the laying/sitting position she was in I would have instantly went to ghost. And then possible invisible person. . 


But when he starts doing things outside where there are cameras. Then yea, it should be over. I’m amazed that restaurant wouldn’t have had cameras they would have shown the knife floating. 

And in the asylum. Cop after cop kept coming into that hallway. I literally saw a camera in the corner of the ceiling pointing right at them. Showing his little suit blinking in and out. And then there were a bunch of people in that first floor control center hat was full of monitors. 

But yea. Otherwise fighting a dude completely invisible would be inane. at the same done I would have argued because he was invisible you should probably keep your knife and gun as close to your body as possible instead of stretching your arm out leaving him all of the chances in the world to just blindly knock it out of your hand.

And how did that guy get his death in the paper?  But there would have to be a coroner report or an medical examiner or something to confirm he was dead  I mean granted he has money so that’s how they can explain a bunch of people lying that he was dead by being paid off.

And how’d he make it back to the house? He wasn’t in the Lyft. And one would think she would have noticed a car following her that whole time.


She threw a bucket of white paint on this dude. And he somehow manages to rinse it off in the sink?! Paint is water soluable now?",fafwsf
fl3kx1r,"Moss was fantastic in this, and it was decent enough, despite there being a few usual questionable actions taken by characters.

I do wish they let it ride for a little longer with the ""is she crazy or is she not"" angle, before being revealed later in the film that she was telling the truth.",fafwsf
fldp9c3,"The end felt a little whack. She went to the bathroom, but then was able to go upstairs, grab the suit, put it on for the first time, figure out how to activate it, go in, use it, leave, take it off, come back as he's still dying.

Loved the movie otherwise.",fafwsf
flvvmrl,"Much better than the Bacon version, and maybe as good as the original.  I think they really used the concept to great effect in terms of building up tension and thrills.  Yes there are things that seem implausible, but with 'the invisible man' I think we are to think it is more like undetectable.  No sounds, no smells.  Only can be seen if the suit is covered with some other substance or damaged.  The suit could have also enhanced the guy's strength, though we have to take that leap of faith since it isn't stated in the film.  However that would help explain the ending in which Cecilia with the suit on is able to force this herculean strength man now not in the suit to slit his own throat.  

In the end Cecilia pretty much threatens James it seems as well.  It was suicide right?  Camera focuses on the suit, James probably worried that there would be consequences if he doesn't go along with her plan and he knows how strong that suit is.

I think the atmosphere, scares were excellent, and Elizabeth Moss was stellar and the other actors did a decent job.  Some of the implausible things could have been better executed, but I still have to give this film 8/10.  Excellent thriller.",fafwsf

fkfspo5,"I really liked the movie, but the ending felt weird to me.  It felt like the first 90% of the movie was written and shot with the idea it was Tom all along.  Adrian killed himself and he was torturing C as payback since he blames her for the death.

Then we find Adrian boarded up in his house.  After that the audience is expected to accept that he staged that as an elaborate ruse. But there are a lot of questions brought up: how did his brother board him up and get to the hospital?  Was Adrian expecting his brother to fail and take the fall?  Was Adrian just using this as a way to excuse his faked suicide, and that this would let him return to life?  Who took the crime scene photos of Adrian if he faked his death?  Who were they planning on pinning the suicide on?  If Adrian acted alone, does that mean he was planning on selling out his brother?  What was his plan to get the cops to get to his place?  Down the rabbit hole I go.

If Adrian died and this was a revenge plot by Tom then it wraps up neatly.  I wonder if things were changed to give a more satisfying end to the revenge plot, or if the writer just wrote themselves into a bit of a corner.  I like the idea that C becomes a cold blooded killer at the end and the questions that come up with her taking the suit.

I also liked how the first 75% of the movie was shot in a way that the story could have painted Celia as crazy and all the invisible man stuff was the result of an unreliable narrator.  Even the hallway scene in the ward seemed too super hero-ie and she had just been giving drugs,  so I still was ready for that reveal.  But that would have undermined the message of abuse and insinuated that women shouldn't be believed about their abuser, so am glad it was just me looking for a twist.

Overall really enjoyed the movie.  The paint scene scared the crap out of me.  Solid 8/10 movie.  Ending just felt a bit messy and relied a bit too much on circumstance.",fafwsf

fk0rci4,"This film was better than i thought it would be (fully acknowledging that this isn't the first invisible villain horror flick \[Hollow Man\])

For me the major pros were:

1. The ability to create tension and horror without having anything be there. Characters constantly staring across the room at nothing. I loved this more than i thought I would.
2. Elisabeth Moss's performance was great.

Cons:

1. On top of having a hi-tech invisibility suit, Adrian appears to have super human strength. He is shown throwing and kicking Kate Moss across the room like a rag doll. Later he absolute demolishes 8 security guards with guns. Even with the suit this would be incredibly difficult. However this is never acknowledged or explained which is kinda weak.
2. Once the suit starts malfunctioning and we can actually see glimpses of him wearing it, most of the tension is lost. Part of this is because of Pro #1 no longer being relevant, and secondly, the suit CGI wasn't very good, looked like some straight to SciFi shit. But soon after this it's no longer a horror film anymore, more of just a thriller.
3. Some silly decisions throughout the film. I can buy no one in the restaurant seeing the floating knife that kills her sister, and i can buy that she's in shock afterwards and can't move. But no cameras in the whole place to see this stuff going on? C'mon.
4. The premise is still just silly. I mean, Hollow Man was pretty ridiculous, but at least that film reasoned the process Bacon underwent is what led to his insanity. In this one he develops the most advanced piece of optics technology in history...and then uses it to terrorize his girlfriend. Sure, ok.

I feel like it could have been more interesting to keep up the tension and just not show Adrian in the suit as much, or at all. She could still discover the suit towards the end and we the audience can piece it together. But the entire reason why it's creepier than your average home intruder/stalker flick is that you can't see the villain. Once you can see him, not scary anymore.

fj2faum,"I'm a little late to the discussion, but does anyone feel like this was very similar to Candyman? In the sense of telling a story about the fear of being accused of something that you didn't do. I think they both capture that fear perfectly. In both movies we see our main character slowly realizing they're being manipulated by an unseen devil who is attempting to throw their lives in a spiral, making everyone else believe that our main character has gone completely mad. I think that's one of my biggest fears, and so both movies having watched them recently have scared me more than any other horror films I've seen in a while.

The paint can scene in the attic probably got the biggest reaction out of me, even though I was expecting something of that sort it still made me shit myself. I also loved how despite the fact I was certain he invisibility was a result of technology as soon as you see the suit's chamber at the beginning of the film, I really enjoyed how the film kept you guessing right up until he started getting physical, and really made you consider that maybe Moss was just going crazy.",fafwsf

The sound design was just awesome, too.

But no. 

It's an evil Tony Stark in a invisible suit. Half expected the ending to be her unbuttoning her dress to reveal the suit underneath with a superhero-logo on her chest. Still cheesy as fuck though; smirking to the cop and showing him the suit in her purse. Are they going to surprise us by revealing that Sydney wore the suit and killed him, just like how out of thin air Adrian was alive and the brother was in the other suit? Nah.

Also, the sister's death was genuinely shocking, I didn't even notice the knife hanging in midair because I was lulled into expecting a quiet scene. Masterful stuff. The second to last Act in the hospital and home is tense stuff. I also really liked the climax - not overly clever, just a very satisfying ending because everyone knows the second suit is still in the house, so it is a very enjoyable build up even when you know what's coming. Classic Chekov's Gun shit, but it didn't feel bland or unsatisfying. That, IMO, is very hard to do. It's success tells you the film makes the stakes and revenge real because you have a connection to Moss' character.

Which brings me to Moss herself. She is GOOD in this. Maybe even great. She's perfect for a twitchy, exhausted, traumatized character without being hysterical or too theatrical.

fkayeh4,"Spoilers!!

I liked the film, I really did... but so many plot holes!! Please correct me if I'm wrong.

1. So no one saw the knife floating through the restaurant?!? I mean, he had to have walked in with it, right... And how did he know she was at the restaurant?!?

2. If you get a call from your friend or sister saying 'hey, can you pick me up at 3:30 - 4 am in the middle of the woods?' Wouldn't the first thing you ask be 'why, what's up?' How is it that the sister had 0 clue why she was picking up her sister. I mean, even if C didn't say why you could kind of guess something was up and ask questions later. 


3. How did Adrain clean himself so well, so quickly? The paint stops in the hallway, but it shows the sink across the room way past where the paint marks end... even if the brother was there, you still would have seen paint drops through the door and outside - especially after washing it off. 


4. Why didn't she just take the phone when she found it? I would have taken it ran and showed James the pictures and all the text messages between him and his brother... 

5. So, it was clearly Adrian's voice in the psych ward we hear when he says 'surprise', but Tom got caught? Where they both there? 

6. So if I find out an invisible suit really does exist - whether or not it is stalking me - I'm going to videotape myself turning it on and off. Why didn't C do that and then send the video to James or her sister? 

7. In the end, why wouldn't James believe that Adrian was the invisible person tormenting her all along? He saw the pictures where he faked his own death... obviously he was in on it... so why is James suddenly playing dumb?

8. According to the director, Adrian was the only invisible suit guy in the entire movie, except during the hospital scene. But, clearly, Adrian was also there because we hear his voice when he says 'surprise' to her in the psych ward. And since it was him at the house, why did the dog bark at him? I don't think it was the brother because C was able to unlock the phone in the attic proving Adrain was at the home, so Adrian would have had to have called his brother and say 'yo, can you stop by my house to get my wife?' Which he couldn't do because she had his phone and how would he know she was going there in the first place? 


9. So no one bumped into him or heard his footsteps... nothing? 

10. She could have easily installed surveillance technology in that house. She was able to get his passcodes and hide stuff in his closet... she could have figured out a way to install nest security cameras.

The only things about it (personally for me) was I just don’t believe that Adrian was just toying , stalking and watching only Cecilia as the movie wants us to believe or only showed us. I think he was watching and toying with James and Sydney as well (more then the movie showed us) , I mean come on the man was in their house for who knows how long and who knows how many times! He knew James was a childhood friend of Cecilia so he probably was jealous ( no doubt) to some degree and toyed and messed with him in some way , whether it was Adrian taking or messing up important paper work James needed for his detective work, or taking or moving stuff that belonged to James else where or even slicing his tires etc.. I refuse to believe that he didn’t f*ck with James in some way . James just probably blamed Sydney or Cecilia or somebody else for it because at the time he didn’t find out about the invisible suit and Adrian until the end or towards the end. I also believe he toyed with Sydney as well and that the reason for that was so he could turn her (and James ) against Cecilia , which is what abusive, controlling and manipulative people do. He probably messed up , took or moved some of her art/design sketches , messed up some of her clothes that she designed, destroyed or just took her homework and put it somewhere she wouldn’t find it , or took something he knew Sydney treasured most and never returned it and Cecilia probably took the blame every time for it which would’ve been his motive for doing any of it. The last thing that bothered me was how cool and calm James and Sydney (except for that fight scene) was after finding everything out ... if I was them I would’ve not been able to step foot back into that house after finding out that a person was in the house wearing an invisible suit and stalking around , possibly watching my every move and doing god knows what else for however long without me knowing it. That would Freak me out for years to come , and I especially wouldn’t be able to live comfortably in my house or sleep comfortably in my house (or anywhere ) ever again without thinking or wondering if someone (who I can’t see) is standing or sitting there watching me! .. I just feel like James and Sydney were way to calm after finding all of that out, especially Sydney who was a young teenage girl! If I was Sydney I would’ve been wondering if whether or not Adrian saw me naked while I was getting dressed, whether or not was he watching me shower at times or did he touch me inappropriately while I was sleeping without me knowing it , which all would’ve been possible with him being in that invisible suit. There was none of that.. James and Sydney just went on like business as usual and I just think that part was unrealistic!",fafwsf

Itd be cool if there was silence.. and then he speaks. Maybe he could go meta and  talk about how oblivious and skeptical the other characters are even though its obvious somethings up. He hit a girl at full force and she thought it was cece... when she was still on the ground. After that maybe he could give an anime monologue delving into his obsession with optics and how people act irrationally when they come across something their mind cant comprehend.

fofq2uy,"I quite enjoyed this, although I generally hate ""everyone thinks the protagonist is crazy when we know she's not"" stories, as well as ""violent guy makes his girlfriend's life a living hell"" stories. There were plot-holes, some of them big enough to fly a 747 through. But some of them are explainable:

*Yes, the bar/restaurant should have cameras, and they should have checked them. But a couple of seconds after the sister's throat was cut, everyone in the restaurant turned to see Cecilia holding a bloody knife, so you can imagine all those onlookers simply saying they saw Cecilia kill her sister and nobody thinking it was necessary to check whether someone else was there. The footage would have been checked for a court case, for sure, but since Cecilia was apparently mentally ill and admitted to a health facility kicking and screaming, she didn't have much of a chance to call her lawyer and say ""hey, you need want to check the cameras at the restaurant."" By that time she appeared to be genuinely experiencing a mental health crisis anyway, so she wasn't thinking very clearly when she later told James that Adrian was in the room with them.

*While Tom and Adrian were probably both psychopaths, I think Adrian really was the mastermind of the whole plot, and probably abused Tom all his life and had him under his thumb. He faked his own kidnapping because it was a relatively easy and convincing way to affirm that the guy whose body they'd just found in an invisibility suit in the home of some decent people he'd tried to kill was the one pulling the strings. And he probably sent Tom to kill Sydney because he knew it was risky, and he'd rather Tom died than himself.

I actually didn't love the ending. While the comeuppance was deserved, and it solved Cecilia's problem, I would rather have seen her use her smarts to reveal his guilt, rather than just using them to reveal his actual jugular vein. As it is, no one but Cecilia ever really acknowledged what she'd been trying to convince people of since the beginning - that her husband was waging a sophisticated campaign to ruin her life. James seemed to affirm that Adrian deserved to die, and that he was willing to cover up Cecilia's involvement, but it's not quite the same as James admitting that Cecilia was right, and that most of the time it was actually Adrian terrorising her.",fafwsf

From the creative use of the camerawork to the main actress conveying such strong survivor guilt made for a very unpleasant watch. I mean it's not surprising considering it was directed by the man who done upgrade which was great mix between balls out action to flat out horror that comes from a fights outcome which remains true in this film but with the horror aspect playing to the max here. Also I find the scariest thing in this movie is seeing the poor lady losing her sanity because those around her refuse to believe her due to her explanation sounding like tall tales so the scene where that boyfriend kills her sister and frames her for murder which cuts to her being dragged to a mental hospital while we see her cursing at that bastard of a husband whose just standing in the background staring at her dismay made me extremely terrified of this dude especially with how he can suddenly just follow this woman anywhere and even find the place she took refuge in.....that's fucking disturbing 

The plotholes were a issue with how the police's daughter immediately puts the blame onto the woman felt out of left field and the fact that there were conveniently no cameras working at the restaurant felt weird but other than that this was quite the horror flick with a terrifying look into domestic abuse and what it could do to the victim all done in a budget of only 7 million which is a slight increase from upgrade's 5 million budget.

Pretty good movie. 7.5/10 (that's pretty good in my ratings. I don't give good ratings away easily). 

I really liked the way the movie made you question your own vision or nitpick your surroundings and kind of gaslights you as the main character begins to as well. Lots of good optic moves. (I think it helped that I saw this at an IMAX theater. Some of the little things might be missed on a smaller screen.)

What I don't understand. The part I don't like. It makes no sense that the guy could just pretend his brother was up to it all and expect her to forgive him and come back. She had a history of being abused by him that went well beyond the movie plot. It was so bad that she planned to escape even before he became invisible.

Our military will have it probably in another 15 years of R&D. The U.S government will be able to carry out swift anonymous assassinations without any blowback.

I liked at the end that there were questions left unanswered. Was Tom the only one killing people, or were Adrian and Tom working together the whole time?

Really enjoyed the movie. I thought it was fraught with suspense, the performances were really good (Elisabeth Moss especially, but Aldis Hodge and Michael Dorman as James and Tom were both great). The scene in the restuarant when her sister dies is legitimately one of the most shocking film moments I can remember, for me anyways. That said, i have some questions..

&#x200B;

\-Re that restaurant scene, i agree with others who have said that the possible camera footage from that restaurant would easily clear Cecilia's name. Maybe Adrian knew that restaruant layout well, or sabotaged the camera or whatever but its never even mentioned. Just one of those movie moments where you shrug. The scene itself is incredible though

\-While i understand the suit renders the user invisible, does it really pad or silence his footsteps and movements as well? Now that we know its literally just a dude in a suit and not some super power, how would she not hear him stepping, moving, at all, like ever? 

\-Agree with other sentiments that the hospital guards act foolishly and just stand there and watch as their colleagues get slaughtered. Fire your gun or throw a punch or something for gods sake, his suit is flickering in and out of sight as well.

\-James takes a pretty severe beating and then just seems fine? Not a huge gripe but he gets beaten repeatedly, hit in the head and plenty of blood, too. No concussion? Just right back to police work the next day?

When she went back to the house the first time I thought it was weird that the dog was there and it almost took me out of the movie, but after we learn about the brother it made sense.  At that moment I also didn’t like that she left the suit but later it fell into place.

I almost think she didn’t even need her buddy there at the end listening. Had she gone by herself, she still would’ve been able to do what she did and no one would know about the extra suit. The camera would’ve only shown him. Also she could’ve hid the suit and come back for it...Why let anyone know about it...

I was on twitter and saw references to the restaurant scene beforehand but I was expecting that! Kind of wish I didn’t see any hint so that I’d be completely surprised but still good.

It’s clear that the suit comes into play the second she turns on the lab lights. The suit turns invisible because the shutter noise is heard when she’s looking in the direction of the machine, so Tom was wearing it. Then when she hops over the fence and is waiting for her sister, when she’s on the road, again the shutter noise can be heard in the tree line so Tom is watching her.

fje08rq,"I definitely had a good time watching it. I do think that the trailers spoiled the big reveal of a person actually there vs. something paranormal.

* The more basic special effects that we see (more like those of Paranormal Activity) make sense for use here. The switch to the more visual effects for the camera/stealth suit later was a nice transition.
* The perspectives for a lot of the shots where you imagine where an invisible person 
* I think it was a good mix of sci-fi and suspense.
* It also serves as a good metaphor for the trauma/scars of an abusive relationship persisting long after that person has gotten out of the situation. Or sort of gaslighting an abused spouse into believing something was going on.
* I know I could never pull of such an insidious plot to torment an EX because I have a digestive issue any my foul-smelling farts would have given me away on Day 1.
* For most of the movie I kept thinking it would be so interesting to have a sequel/second move that shows what was going on from the perspective of the Invisible Man - how often he was really there, how he avoided detection in a lot of the scenes - but that would ruin a lot of the mystery.
* I don't know what fraction of the invisible activity was done by Adrian vs. Tom--would have definitely helped with the part at the secure hospital if Adrian was waiting for Cecelia to act and Tom was ready to move in on James/Sidney. Or if one could keep watch at Adrian's house while the other watched James' house (for the part where Cecelia escaped in the Lyft to go and search for the suit at Adrian's house.

&#x200B;

To the theories that Adrian's brother Tom was the mastermind instead of Adrian:

* I'm pretty sure we see scars on Cecelia's body when she first escapes, so unless they were somehow self inflicted, they must have come from Adrian, and wouldn't be from Tom.
* We know Adrian was a physically strong and violent person because he runs after breaks Alice's window with his bare hands to try to stop her from leaving.
* Tom wouldn't really have much stake in Cecelia's baby with Tom unless the father was not Adrian, and the pregnancy was made a very big deal. Tom also wouldn't want any direct heirs to Adrian if he was gunning for a large share of the inheritance.
* Tom would have benefited more from leaving Cecelia charged with the crime of Alice's murder (now with no inheritance) and locked away than offering Cecelia a way out and back to Adrian.
* Adrian was definitely the inventor of a the camera/stealth suit. Something like that I feel like wouldn't be designed without malicious intent- Seem highly unlikely that blackmail Adrian into creating the suit to elaborately torment Adrian's ex-partner. An evil Tom would more than likely just use it own his own ex.
* I feel like Adrian might have used the word ""surprise"" or some other unconscious verbal clue in his final dinner/conversation with C that solidified her decision to end him.

To the theories that Cecelia was the manipulative one instead of Adrian:

* I think a lot of arguments would require an unreliable narrator to mislead the audience, such as that the wounds/scars that Cecelia has in the start were self inflicted.
* Her fear in the opening scenes when no one was watching except the audience, even after she was outside the view of the security cameras would be hard to explain - she didn't suddenly drop character outside the wall.
* An evil/abusive Cecelia would also make Adrian's violent breaking of Alice's window hard to explain- why wouldn't he let her just leave?
* It would seem more likely that Cecelia would try to kill Adrian and frame it as a suicide while she was still inside the home at the start rather than running away if she was the controlling/abusive one in the relationship.
* An abuser's physical and mental power usually is strongest when they can be physically present in the same space as the victim.
* It seems unlikely that Cecelia would intentionally fake estrange herself from Alice, James, and Sydney, blaming it on Adrian, all in an effort to paint Adrian as the villain.
* If Cecelia was the toxic/evil one, why would Tom stage the fake the death and then orchestrate/fake the kidnapping of Adrian? An evil Cecelia would have used the Benzo drugging at the beginning to ""kidnap/kill"" Adrian rather than just running away.

Small complaints about narrative/plot holes:

* The kitchen fire, the random missing/moved objects seemed like a great method to gaslight Cecelia. But, the phone in the attic, the email sent from her computer, assaulting Sydney from across the room, and a few other pieces of evidence are near concrete proof of the suit/invisible man to Cecelia and to an outsider. I think by that point he made sure she was estranged enough from her friends and family that no one would believe her, but a more sinister villain would have played it much slower and really left Cecelia with no hard physical evidence so even she would doubt herself. 
* A lot of the characters did seem frustratingly resistant to believe in the presence of the invisible man, especially the guards at the treatment facility-- and then they would die from his attacks.  There's no way a crouching/huddled Cecelia could have taken out 6 guards, especially all the guards dead from bullet wounds and no gun within reach of Cecelia, but two more would arrive on the scene and immediately assume she was the threat, refuse to call for backup, and then be killed themselves.
* Conversely, if the investigation of Tom's death revealed to the world/police department the existence of a suit capable of enacting the murder of Alice (and exonerating Cecelia), the investigation of Adrian's ""suicide"" by video footage should certainly invite the possibility of a second suit used by Cecelia to murder Adrian in the mind of anyone investigating it.",fafwsf

Yet later on in the movie, James just tells her ""there were multiple witnesses at the hospital who also said they saw something strange"".

The message of the film was really good, but I found myself muttering to myself about specific events that happened. It was all fairly predictable as well. I figured out which characters would end up dying. I also think the action sequences were weaker than I had hoped for. Especially the hospital scene, with how all the guards kind of stood there, as if waiting to be attacked. 

Also, with the dog, why was the dog staying at the house after Adrian's ""death""? With all the furniture being covered, it's clear that the police/a crew was there at some point, and ALL of them left the dog there for at least a few days? Really? Also, the dog disappeared at the end. What happened to the dog? 

So, I'm wavering between a 6/10 or 7/10. I'd probably give it a 7/10 because what WAS good was REALLY good. I loved many of the shots that they had, and Elisabeth Moss was fantastic.",fafwsf
fl37v2p,"Fantastic movie, extremely well done! One thing I haven’t seen anyone mention is that both invisible brothers were in the police officers house to kill his daughter near the end. The husband was maced and fell into the dresser, then when the girl ran she ran right into something, I assume the brother. Then when the police find the husband being held hostage, his eyes were red like he’s been maced.

Really great film. If they had removed the invisible mans breath from that outdoor scene, it would have worked better. We would have been led to think that maybe she was going insane from PTSD until the paint scene.

Also, I don’t believe she was really pregnant. The first doctor didn’t tell her because she was not pregnant. The husband was in the room when she told her sister she switched the birth control, how else would he know where to send the estate letter? He then changed her records to make her seem pregnant to fuck with her more and bring her home. Very very dark as it sounded like he raped her while asleep after she had escaped.",fafwsf

fjm33zd,"Like a lot of people are saying, I enjoyed this movie apart from the glaring logical inconsistencies. 

Granted, some of them were forgiveable, like the restaurant not getting the sister's murder on camera (maybe there wasn't a clear shot?), the dog being able to see the invisible man even when he's, you know, invisible (dog sixth sense? Maybe the suit works with some sort of light bending tech that doesn't work on dog eyes, etc), the invisible man fast travel (he could've followed them, or it could be Tom and Adrian double teaming), and the suit switcheroo at the end (Tom could've been manipulated too, or just evil).

But there are a few that i just can't get over. Namely:

1. Why the hell does the sister, who's known Cecilia her whole life, not question the hell out of that email? If your sister has always been mild-mannered and kind to you, why the fuck would you believe an email out of nowhere saying a bunch of horrible mean shit? I  mean even if you didn't buy into the invisible man thing, surely someone could have hacked into C's fucking gmail?

2. In the same vein, James and his daughter trust C on such an incredible level, that she literally sleeps in the same bed as the girl....yet neither the daughter nor James question the fact that she would haul off and punch the girl right in the effing face from a lying position 5 feet away????? Wtf???

3. There are several problems with Adrian's supposed death in the beginning....A: if his death made national news and was convincing enough to warrant a notice of heirs, why is there no police report, coroner's report, or LITERAL BODY! And why does no one question his sudden reappearance at the end? B: If he's dead and she's across the state, who the hell is taking care of the dog that's been left alone in that giant house for presumably, weeks?

4. When the hospital informs Cecilia that she is pregnant and she meets with Tom, Tom says he can basically undo her charges and she can go back to living with Adrian as if nothing happened if she agrees to keep the baby....how tf does he plan on doing that??? She's wanted for murder, and Adrian is supposedly dead....all the money in the world can't really guarantee you'll get off Scot-free of a murder charge, especially when there were a million witnesses.

Like i said, none of these really warrant it as a bad movie, but shit like this annoys me.",fafwsf

They never questioned why she killed her sister in the restaurant? Are there absolutely no cameras to show that the knife was not swinging by itself? Ok let says there was none. Fine.

The end of the movie, she goes and kills her husband by using the other suit. So this mastermind who plotted the whole thing this whole time is not going to realize that one suit is missing? Are you for real? It's those moments that makes movies with potential just shitty. Sorry but this was my opinion. On a side note, Elizabeth Moss's performance was just amazing.",fafwsf

Just to have that ending scene of her walking with the dog. Nothing in this movie makes any sense. The more you think about it the less sense it makes. I haven't seen anybody say anything about the dog, so I'm putting it out there. 

The movie doesn't make sense from the first scene. She drugged him by putting shit in his water, which so obviously had something in it, and he didn't taste it? And then she escapes, and he pops up right when she gets in the car? Come on. How anybody thinks this is a good movie makes me question their mental faculties. This is a hill I'm willing to die on. How it actually got made is astonishing. How many people did this go through to be greenlit?",fafwsf
fizi8b0,"I thought the first hour was absolutely incredible, but it dropped off significantly after she got arrested imo. The acting was great across the board, especially Elizabeth Moss. Another of so many great actress performances in horror movies lately.

The revelation that Adrian faked his own imprisonment just raised a ton of questions, namely how, if we accept their staged reality, that the brother imprisoned him and staged his suicide, how the hell did the rest of the world actually believe that Adrian was dead?

Also if Elisabeth Moss hid one of the suits in the vent, wouldn't Adrian have wondered where the hell it went?

Overall it was worth it for the extremely satisfying final scene, but up until the final 20 minutes I was with the film 100% of the way, then I think it very nearly swallowed its own tail.

There is something to be said for not revealing too much too quickly. ""The Invisible Man"" is a solid and suspenseful thriller that had my pulse quickening many more times than one.

Moss' portrayal of Cecilia, a woman tormented by her ex- (and assumed dead) boyfriend, is very convincing. She teeters on the verge of a nervous breakdown for most of the film.

The story is ripe-with-tension first few minutes of the film very efficiently reels you in, in no small part due to the soundtrack and sound design.

From that point on, it is a deadly game of invisible-cat and mouse that unfolds in front of your eyes. Clues abound as to what the endgame might be, therefore your attention is engaged and sustained throughout.

The ""Invisible Man"" will keep you on the edge of your seat. From Start to Finish.

It was one of those situations where someone was getting the shit kicked out of them, while the others just stood and watched until they got the shit kicked out of them, too. It was like watching a line of dominos fall over. And despite countless people pointing their guns at him, not just in the hospital but the later scene in the house, virtually nobody pulled the trigger. I was also frustrated that while there was probably video footage of some kind in the restaurant, it wasn't acknowledged at all. And maybe someone would have seen the knife just...

We are led to believe that Adrian was the Invisible Man through things characters say to us and potential red herrings.

We want to assume things that aren’t explicitly shown, and that Cee made the right decision. We don’t care because Invisible man or not, Adrian isn’t shown to be a good guy.

However, I just lost it at the part in the restaurant where somehow she's shaking her fist with a big hole perfect to stick the knife handle into.

Also somehow a guy in a full body suit is fast enough to pick up the knife, slash the sister's throat, switch from holding the knife by the handle to the blade, then perfectly insert the knife handle into her hand while she's shaking her fist around, and all in one motion?

That part could've been handled so much better. To make sense with the same outcome they could've just had him slash the sister's throat and put the knife on the table as the waiter turned around and have the waiter freakout. Not quite as cool looking but close with much more sense.

flmzmqw,"Been thinking about the suit. This is just a movie blah blah, but I'm genuinely curious as to how it works and how it could  be developed in real life. I suppose the suit needs to have some sort of eye tracking device to maintain the illusion, like the big screen in the Kremlin scene in Mission Impossible 4. The suit needs to constantly adjust its projections based on the observer's eye movement and perspective, or else the observer would see a vague human shape (like Predator's cloaking device) instead of nothing. 

During the hospital fight scene none of the guards could see Adrian/Tom (suit glitching not considered), which means the suit can track multiple people's eye movements simultaneously, and adjust the images to fool each of them. I can get my head around the first part, but does it also mean that each little screen on the suit can display different perspectives of an image all at the same time? How is it possible?

I also agree that they should've left out the ""invisible man"" part of the title and plot.

This movie has a huge potential to work out as a heavy psychological movie, instead of this ""technology"" suit. I mean, she is on *Diazepam* which is commonly used for people with anxiety and/or people with a psychological diagnosis. The drug is a ""benzo"" which is calming *and addictive.* I don't get why *all they did* with the bottle of drugs was to push the plot, so that we would understand she's not full of bullshit and that she actually is being stalked.

Every new scene drives the story forward or develops the characters further. Adrian’s presence in the film is so unmistakable even though we don’t even see him until the last 15 minutes. From Cecilia’s brief explanations of who he was, to the mind games he was playing, the character was being developed all the time.

It’s just a really, really well-done film. Exposition strikes a good balance where they explain enough but never too much. This movie respects its audiences and leaves a lot of storytelling in its visual cues instead of clumsily explaining it.

The best thing is that it tackles some seriously disturbing themes that elevate its simple concept and heightens the tension. I can go on and on but they will really be just variations of “this is expertly-made.”

It also looks like we have the Toni Collette-Lupita Nyong’o performance of 2020, aka the outstanding-female-performance-that-gets-ignored-by-major-award-bodies-because-it’s-in-a-genre-film curse. Elisabeth Moss was unreal in this movie and I hope she ends up breaking the cycle.

One little nitpick: I wish that Leigh Whannel didn’t muffle the “I SEE YOU!” moment. I get the effect he was going for but that was such a raw and powerful moment and performance in the film. I wish he left it as is instead of manipulating the sound effect for an understandable reason.",fafwsf

1. The scene where Sydney gets hit and thinks it was Cecilia could have been filmed better. Cecilia looked too far away for Sydney to believably think it was Cecilia that hit her. It would have been more believable if they started walking out of the room and Sydney had her back to Cecilia, then got hit. 

2. Why would her sister believe the email was true if Cecilia showed up at her house looking happy to see her if she said things as drastic as “I never want to see you again.”

3. Why would she catch the knife after Adrian murdered Emily? It happened so fast she wouldn’t have reacted to catch the knife like that. 

4. Why would Cecilia not put the suit on after she found it at Adrian’s house once she realized someone was there? Makes zero sense to hide it in the house. She could have put it on and run. Then she would be able to escape AND she’d have all the evidence she needs. 

5. Similarly, why would she not take a picture of the suit mid-transition? A video of it transitioning?

There also a lot of little dumb things... I guess her BF had an invisible car too? Or did he hang on to the uber car frame sideshow Bob style? Because he got back to his house fast.

fl91bp8,"Just finished it a few minutes ago. It was okay. Definitely overrated. It was just so illogical in parts and asked me to suspend my disbelief a little too much a little too often.

- Why would she not immediately take the photos of her and the cops' daughter sleeping to the cop? He would have been convinced immediately that someone, maybe not quite an invisible man, but that at least *someone* was fucking with her. Imagine how this would have enhanced the scene with the cop when she is being interrogated after she supposedly kills her sister. He would have been way more conflicted knowing something weird was going on but not yet being able to truly accept an invisible man existing. It would have been way more interesting.

- Bad guy gets a bucket of paint dumped on him and he cleans it all up perfectly without making a sound, in one minute *maybe* two. And he is wearing a suit with a bunch of small crevices. It is being generous to say it would have taken him an hour minimum to clean it, let alone 120 seconds. Continuing with this scene, she only realizes he is in the kitchen when the sink turns on. But he is somehow already completely clean. What? He would have had to turn the sink on in order to clean himself in the first place. That whole scene was just objectively *really* poorly thought out. 

- Bad guy is a scientist/engineer in optics and creates an amazingly sophisticated invisibility suit. Presumably, that would take a lot of time and dedication. And yet somehow he is in peak physical condition and able to single-handedly take down like a dozen armed security guards with his bare hands. I'm able to suspend my disbelief and let this one slide but it was still a little too much. EDIT: I made a mistake with this one. In this scene, it is actually the brother who is beating up all the cops. But I think the point stands that it was a little over the top. It would have been more believable if there were half as many cops instead of having him kick ass like he is a member of the X-Men.

- If he was only invisible because of the suit, how did we see his breath in the beginning when they were outside in the cold? I know they were trying to keep us questioning whether everything was in her head or not, but we know that it wasn't. He would have had to lift his mask up for that scene to make sense, and his face would have been exposed. 

- When the sister is killed. He pulls the knife out of nowhere and somehow slices her neck from the opposite side of the table, again without making a single sound or knocking over a glass or disrupting anything on the table, and then places the knife in the protagonist's hand perfectly, again within seconds. Does this dude have 6ft long arms? And wouldn't the restaurant have cameras that show a floating knife slicing her neck? 

Overall I enjoyed my time with the movie but my God the plotholes are massive once you stop to think about it.",fafwsf

fj5siy1,"Fun movie but don’t think too hard. You have to work to suspend belief a lot. When the paint gets dumped on the suit the dude does a 30 second clean up and it’s immaculate? Shows me no one on set has ever tried to get paint off something with water. How does Adrian get up and down in the attic  silently? Why is he even in the attic? I guess he just planted stuff up there to mess with her head. I have a hard time with the idea that suit would be silent, or that she would know how to use it immediately, or that it’s one size fits all. A tiny scene of her finding his notes would help. Throw some sound dampening tech onto the pile. How do you see in the suit? It’s all cameras. No eye holes. It’s got to be somewhat permeable because his breath comes through it. How is the brother or Adrian for that matter superhumanly strong. There is no way that little brother drags a massively muscled cop down the hall like he’s a stuffed animal. Seriously a single scene with Adrian talking about how it enhances strength would be cool. Also this movie has enough Chekhov’s guns that it was telegraphing the movie, the fire extinguisher, the mace, I knew she would turn the tables with the hidden suit. I also knew it was baby bro for the fake out, given he left witnesses alive. Too little faith in the audience.",fafwsf

I really liked the ending, but I understand why some people didn't. I think that Cecilia had gone through so much that it needed that bit of catharsis to keep the movie from being a total downer.

fj4e8ii,"This movie is a great example of how taking the time to build your characters and committed acting make a huge difference in genre movies like this. I can't overstate how much Elisabeth Moss's performance *makes* this movie. The supporting cast is good too but she absolutely tears into the role and makes you feel how broken this woman is and therefore how dangerous Adrian is. Everything in the movie is scary *because* she makes you buy it and you don't forget for a second what the stakes are. Credit to Whannell's script and direction too, because he did a fine job, but this is a classic example of treating your premise seriously and elevating what could be hokey material.

I couldn't help but think how much less impressive the movie would be if the lead performance wasn't as strong or if the movie didn't take the time to make you care about her or her loved ones. It's still a smartly directed intense thriller but it would feel so hollow (pun slightly intended) if you didn't really care about what was happening. How many horror movies or thrillers do you see where that's exactly the case? They're a dime a dozen, and Blumhouse is far from innocent of it at that.",fafwsf
fj5dqzq,"Was anybody else thrown off by the ending? 

It almost seems like a reshoot or an alternate ending you’d find on the special features of the DVD. 

Maybe it’s supposed to show that he actually changed her because she became like him almost gaslighting the black cop friend at the end by saying Adrian commuted suicide? 

Regardless, it seemed a bit convoluted. 

Might be a little corny but for the few seconds before we saw Adrian was still alive I really I liked the idea of the plot twist that the brother was the bad guy all along and Adrian actually did kill himself. 

But the guy needed to prove she was insane to get the money that Adrian left her instead of him, the guy who has been handling all of his money his whole life. 

So he kept trying to convince her that Adrian was the one haunting her in the suit.",fafwsf
fj5ulqf,"Aight, lets talk about the twist of Tom being an invisible man.

Quick show of hands, who thinks it would've been better if Adrian was dead the whole movie, or it was left ambiguous if he was still alive, rather than killing Tom, then Adrian?

And whats with the scene where a bunch of security guards get killed at the psych hospital? The timeline doesnt make sense.

So one of the invisible men threatened to kill the Sydney, James's daughter- C was like 'aw hell naw' and chased them thru the streets while frantically calling James. She lost him in the chase soon after. Then, before James or C could get there, Tom as the invisible man got there and attempted to kill the girl, dying in the process.

Are we to believe when C lost track of the invisible man in the car chase(doesn't matter, she knows where hes going) Tom and Adrian met up, pulled off a wetsuit as quickly as possible and tagged each other out, and got there a good 5 minutes before C or James got there? And Adrian went home, boarded himself up in the basement, and tied himself up?

No no no none of this makes sense. Tom mustve been the invisible man the entire time as the mental institution. It makes SOME sense, since the invisible man was weaker, since C was able to push back, and sloppier, since he went around murdering people rather than slipping out, and he left survivors and undoubtedly left Camera evidence. Plus, why kill Sydney that night? That was just sloppy for someone who was hiding out in someones house not speaking or eating or pissing for 2-3 weeks straight.

But then.....why? Did Adrian suspect he was about to get caught when he clearly had complete control and was doing a freakin' victory lap? There was no reason to tag his brother in advance, UNLESS he knew it was going south....and theres no reason he would think that....",fafwsf
fj8oaq9,"Overall I thought it was great. Opening scene, the email, the photos, sabotaging the job interview, the Attic scene, restaurant scene, all the psych ward stuff and the ending were all great.  

So my issue is a tad nitpicky.

My problem is >!the number of suits!<, and the hiding place in the closet. 

It's hard for me to believe Adrian, the total control freak, doesn't know about the hiding place in the closet.  He probably put it there when he had his closet built.  It makes sense he wouldn't expect her to hide a getaway bag in there the night she escapes, but he surely would have noticed she took her stuff and must of hid the bag somewhere, and he would have figured it out there, because from the looks of the house there is nowhere else. 

Now onto >!the number of suits.  There have to be at least two, but likely three full working suits. One for Adrian, one for his brother, and one for her to hide in the closet. One suit is damaged during the hospital escape, the other one is damaged when the brother is shot.
The brother can't be wearing the suit in the hospital because he was just there in person and couldn't have changed and snuck into the cell, so that had to be Adrian. He escapes in the SUV, or that could have been the brother and Adrian takes another vehicle to his house to set up his captivity. It just seems odd to me that she takes a suit and nobody notices that one is gone when they clearly need two or more for the logic to work!<",fafwsf

I like that there was some sort of explanation on how the invisible suit works. I originally thought we were just going to have to accept it.

It also did not need to be two hours long. Especially when the entire last half falls apart if you think about it longer than two seconds.

Off the top of my head, if anyone can explain these

-	how did nobody question the claim that Adrian was dead? The film tries to play it off by saying his brother did it, but we’re expected to believe that he also forged toxicology reports, a body, the CSI scene and everything all without any of that leaking.
-	When Adrian leaves the phone and knife for Cecilia, why does she leave the phone and instead take the knife out of the bag that it’s in? 
-	Why doesn’t Cecilia take photos of the suit when she finds it? Why even leave the suit in the closet to begin with?
-	How does the all powerful and all knowing Adrian not know there’s a cache in his own closet?
-	How does someone not register a punch from a grown male coming from a completely different direction at an angle?
-	Does the suit give superpowers? Because depending on the scene the wearer has both super speed, silent footsteps, and massive strength, but it’s never elaborated. 
-	Adrian gets spilled with a ton of paint that somehow covers his top half heavily, but then within moments he manages to run around the house not only not leaving any marks anywhere, but also cleaning the paint off in a sink so thoroughly that his suit has no sign of it.
-	Did the hospital not have security cameras? Does nowhere in San Francisco have them?
-	If Adrian is so super rich and super powerful, how come there was just one guy handling everything regarding his finances to the point that nobody at any juncture asked what happened to their massive research that he had in his basement?
-	Speaking of that research, how come the special forces that raid the house didn’t take it or inspect it? In the end they just say “whatever the suit was it’s broken now, no evidence here.”
-	And how in the hell did the special forces not know how to look in a closet?
-	Why didn’t Cecilia just say there were two suits?
-	Stabbing yourself in the wrist with a pen means you’re not fighting with that hand two seconds later.
-	The suit is shown to be custom fit for Adrian, yet both Cecilia and his brother wear it without any problems.",fafwsf

Would have much rather seen a more ambiguous plot about the questioning of her sanity, as others have said. The trailer is basically the whole movie, and because of that (and the fact we know Adrian is still alive just minutes after learning about his death) the set up doesn’t work. There’s no true building of tension, rather the recycling of the same jump scare in a different room. Useless characters literally just walk in a room two at a time to get merked by this guy.

* The restaurant scene: yes, it caught me off guard and was pretty damn scary. But does the restaurant have no cameras? And what was with them going to some high-end place considering the situation? Doesn't that seem like an appropriate time for Chili's or something?

* When Moss' character goes to the house and discovers the suit: why didn't she put on the suit and walk out? Or at the very least take pictures of it, she had her phone didn't she? It seemed like the only reason she left it there was so the movie could have the ending it did.

* The logistics of how Griffin faked his death are too crazy to not explain. Yeah the brother was in on it, but how'd they fool the coroner, whoever did the autopsy, etc?

* The hallway fight with the cops: She had so much time to pick up the gun and shoot him, why didn't she?

Also the suit somehow gives super human strength, letting an average built adult lift a grown women by the throat with one hand and throw her meters through the air across the room.",fafwsf

fizg7iy,"This is a horror movie about stalking and domestic violence with a little bit of SF touch. It was hard for me to watch vulnerable protagonist haunted by invisible predator-husband helplessly most of the running time. Of course she won at the end, but I don’t know… there’s no catharsis you can feel about her winning. For me, she didn’t win, she just finally escaped from her misery.

After all, The Invisible Man is a good horror movie, but I have to admit, this is not a movie you can enjoy with a light heart. Making an invisible man film in a victim’s perspective gave a freshness to the familiar story, but it’s also disturbing as much as it’s scary. Not for everybody.

- I don't like that Adrian had these superhuman qualities: being able to build such advance technology on his own, and being able to kill 8 cops (but unable to kill a woman in the house scene)

- I liked the brother right before the blackmailing scene, he first came across as having a grudge against her for 'making' his brother commit suicide, but then revealing he also loathed him. I think that was enough from him. I can't see a reason as to why he would get involved in his brother's affair so deeply beyond the fact Adrian is a super bad man. At least some explanation on how Adrian manipulated him would've been nice.

- I don't find the ending believable, after a big scandal of invisible men doing killings, it would look very convenient that Adrian cut his throat in the meantime she was in the bathroom. It just doesn't fly.

I liked this one because it was an ACTUAL man wearing an INVISIBLE suit. It wasn’t his spirit haunting her, and it wasn’t just that she was crazy the whole time. The entire setup of this movie was brilliant because it was so different, and unlike anything I’ve ever seen. I’m so glad I watched this movie. 

And the scene where the sister died at the restaurant...I’ll never forget that. There were too many plot twists in this movie, and I was pleasantly surprised at every turn. Definitely 10/10 in my opinion.",fafwsf
flgg4on,"When I watched the movie I had a theory that I dont seem to find people commenting anywhere in the internet. At the end, the explanations are left open, so ofc every explanation is possible, but everyone seems too quick to blame Adrian for everything, but this seems to me to be exactly the opposite of what the director meant.

It is too easy to take Cecilia at her word, that Adrian is manipulative and violent (even if he admits to some mistakes) and therefore we extrapolate that he is actually capable of doing all the stalking/gaslighting. Even his use of the word 'surprises' at the end could be just an accident and not a confession. But the only evidence we as viewers and the police has is that his brother is the known killer.

My theory is that the police theory is actually right, it was Tom all along and Adrian was actually abducted by his brother. The plot holes here are the motivations of Tom to do all that. But there is too little of Tom to judge what is already explicit, so we might as well make assumptions on his motivations.

I would suggest just one of multiple possible scenarios: That Tom was somehow obsessed with Cecilia. Maybe he was already using the suit to stalk her inside Adrian's home (with or without Adrian's permission) before the movie timeline begins. For me, the point in the movie that indicates this is a pan shot in the house, while Cecilia is changing closes. This shot shows an empty corridor as if 'the invisible man' was walking through the corridor. But Adrian was still asleep (she checks the phone to see the camera in his room and is satisfied after she changes). At this point in my theory, Tom was there, already disguised, but he was still only in stalker mode, he did not yet escalate his behavior, so he does not restrain her.

From this point, Tom makes a psycho plan to use the idea of his brother to try to manipulate Cecilia into whatever crazy plans he had. This could be something like make her submit to him as a captive and he would always wear the suit and pretend to be the brother, or whatever -  let's not go to deep into psycho psychology... His apparent concern about her child could be explained as just basic family affection - as he is the uncle, it is reason enough, or could be just a facade to pretend he is Adrian.

He keeps Adrian in a basement and not actually kill him either to take information or as part of the same family affection which would rend him unable to kill hios borther, but to imprison him - remember he is a psycho.. no questions there, he was gonna kill an underage girl even if it wasnt him who toyed with the cops while killing them.

Anyway, this rambling was just me trying to fill some plot holes.

I feel that at the end Cecilia was too arbitrary, it wasnt justice. There was no proof that Adrian was guilty of the stalking/gaslighting/murders. I understand she was near neurotic after everything she went through and that she felt his use of the word 'surprises' was a confession, but for any justice system in the world, that wouldnt be enough.

Adrian could be guilty only of the things he confessed.. of treating her badly, and even this could be interpreted as him just trying to be apologetic to get her back. I dont remember if he explicitly confesses about physical violence - in essence it could be that he is actually innocent of that too. We only have her word, and although I know it is not hip nowadays to doubt when a woman says she has been physically or psychologically abused, we cannot exclude that. In the opening scene she was using medication and she seemed quite shaken psychologically, we assume it is Adrian's fault but we can't be sure of this. Perhaps her 'problems' with Adrian were exacerbated by her psychological state.

I guess it bothers me that because the director and the amazing acting of Elizabeth Moss makes us sympathize with the protagonist, people just jump to the conclusions that she is right while ignoring the facts that we can see in the movies and all other plot holes.

So here is an idea for a psychological thriller sequel: The invisible Woman (Yes, I know this title is taken, but whatever) - The same story from the point of view of Adrian. His relationship with Cecilia in which he is not perfect, but not abusive. Also her faults in the relationship and the beginning of her becoming crazy. The relationship between Tom and Adrian. The point where she leaves him. His depression. His abduction by Tom. His honest attempt at a reconciliation. I guess for this movie to work we have to mess a little with the timeline, start with the end, go to the beginning and make a twist when his brother abducts him - perhaps with flashbacks after.

I know that a lot of what we see and feel superficially in the movie contradicts my theory, but I would love to hear in-depth comments about why my theory doesnt work. That was a long rant, sorry about that :p",fafwsf
flnt9zp,"I enjoyed it a lot. Not as good as Upgrade, but it was a fun and tense two hours. I've been a fan of Leigh Whannell since Saw so it's really cool to see him find success as a director as well as a writer.

Although there was one massive plot hole, >!when he slits the sister's throat in the restaurant. I can suspend disbelief to a degree and imagine that none of the other guests noticed the knife hovering in the air, but surely there would be cameras in a public place like that? It was a genuinely shocking moment but they could've figured out a more plausible way of doing it.!<",fafwsf

1. There should have been a gazillion cameras in that restaurant to show she did not kill her sister.

2. So she breaks out of a mental institute, there are 8 cops dead, she is on the run, this is after being the only suspect in killing her sister. How was she released for anything in the second half of the film to happen? She should still be under arrest, awaiting court.

There were nearly no plot holes from my perspective. Every proposed plot hole I’ve seen in this thread can explained either by Adrian’s invisible presence, or something established at some point in the movie. In fact, many were not plot holes at all but rather deliberate hints, such as the dog Zeus remaining in the house.

The restaurant scene will stand as one of the most shocking movie moments in recent history for me. The brief look on Emily’s face said she realized it was all true, but it was too late. I’d never have seen that twist coming. Whoa.",fafwsf
fjedm7v,"I enjoyed it but the plot was far too muddy and unclear. The differing motives of Adrian and Tom, who was doing what, who was the mastermind...I still don't think there's any conclusion that makes a whole lot of sense.

Camera in the restaurant? Dog left alone? How many suits were there? Why was there focus on rain? If he wanted a child, why was he beating the shit out of her? Why would brother agree to tie him up? Who's ashes were they? Who the fuck did they autopsy?!

Fucking mess of a film",fafwsf
ft06h5a,"So I enjoyed this movie but I really don't get the ending?

I can give some things the benefit of the doubt like the camera in the restaurant and such but the ending really throws me off. Like first off, how is this guy just allowed in his house now as if nothing happened and got off scott free? That logic really got to me.

Also what was the MC's motivation to kill him? I know she hated him and such and wanted him to admit it rather than kill him but her cover story has a lot of holes in it. Like for one she just became innocent after people found out about the suit. People could convict her for the same reason especially if she has no alibi between her going to the bathroom and then her finding him dying. Also why the hell is she leaving the scene of the crime? That'll get her convicted alone. The logic doesn't add up.

Personally I'd of finished the film at the point where she finds out it's the brother. Or even put in a small scene after where she finds out that the suit in the ventilation system is missing. Would've not only paced the movie well but left it on a chilling cliff hanger.",fafwsf
fj9amv8,"Really don't understand the praise for this one. I thought it was a fairly standard shlocky movie with a few jump scares. Some elements of the story I couldn't really ignore. 

Like how did nobody watch back any footage of the murder in the restaurant? Especially when the movie makes a big deal out of cameras in other areas of the movie.

Why didn't she take the photos from the phone in the attic and show them to anyone? Surely it would have at least gotten James on her side.

And how conveniently the suit was ""damaged"" at the end and just flickered before working perfectly again for no reason. 

Beyond those things that sort of just stuck with me,

Cecilia was played very well but toward the end she kind of went between totally unhinged and really stable as the story/scene demanded it.

The music during the fight scenes was so loud and obnoxious, totally didn't suit the movie imo. It was like straight out of Inception

- Score is amazing! Rewatched Lights Out a few days and immediately recognised the composer's work.

Solid 6.",fafwsf
fj2tajz,Very overrated IMO.,fafwsf
fj6my6o,"This movie is great but it falls apart just a little every time you think about something. 

- A crowded restaurant like that would have cameras everywhere. As much as I like the scene, would it not have been a lot less refutable if he had forced her to grab the knife and stab her without footage of a floating weapon?

- All of her claims about Adrian fell apart because of no evidence, but the fact that she explicitly claimed he was invisible with a suit, then footage from a hospital surfaces of a glitching invisible suit killing dozens make her very much believable and kinda negate any suspicions against her that people supposedly had later on in the movie?

- Following from that, security footage shows Adrian supposedly killing himself at the end, but even then this has shown to not be enough evidence. With no motive in sight, why would the police believe that she didn't use a similar suit.

- PAINT DOES NOT WASH OFF THAT EASILY OR QUICKLY. This suit has cracks in it that could surely not be paint-proof.

- Who would believe an email coming out of nowhere like that? What a bitch of a sister. 

- DON'T DRUG YOUR PREGNANT GIRLFRIEND, DIPSHIT

- How did she break the suit's functionality by stabbing it with a pen? Is the CPU located literally everywhere?

- WHY stab him with the pen? It's filled with ink and you are bleeding profusely! Throw yourself at him and you have a black/blue and red idiot walking around defenseless!

- Did Adrian not notice a missing suit? Sure it's invisible but... he would surely know.

- He was up in that attic for quite some time, and yet he kept paint by the door ready for throwing? Was he hunting his own invisible man? 

- Are camera-suits grippy? it holds a knife handle just like a hand would. 

- Why keep a second suit around? If the police come, they'll find it. If he needs it for his brother or as a backup, why not hide it? 

- Why open on a shot of crashing waves? The ocean is never important to the plot in the slightest. 

- What's the battery life on that suit? I didn't see a generator built into that thing. Did it come with an invisible USB charger?

- Why take smartphone pictures? You have a suit made of cameras and that's the best you have? Could have made a 360 degree pic!

- Why is Elizabeth Moss a ~~scientist~~ Scientologist after playing characters so hellbent on escaping religious confinement, gaslighting and abuse?",fafwsf
fj8ghfm,"I enjoyed it, but it wasn't phenomenal. I really liked Moss's acting, the camera work was great and there was some great scenes (the painting and restaurant comes to mind), but some things bothered me:

- How did Adrian faked his death? It was in the newspapers. If it's in the newspapers, somewhere somehow cops were involved, the coroner, etc., and if he was such a big figure in tech it would have been even more scrutinized. I though they would answer it, but nope.
- Adrian is like superhuman. EVEN if you're ripped like he is, you have to be some master of combat to take down multiple guards with one punch or not much effort.
- We understand that James is a detective, but why would he be the one to interrogate someone close to him? Someone who murdered one of his friends? Someone who LIVED IN HIS HOUSE? I feel like they overused the fact he's a policemen and put it in every situation possible.
-  I don't know if the brother was already involved in the whole we-are-invisible, but it never bothers Cecilia how FAST Adrian catches her everytime? She goes to his house in an uber, he arrives not long after - she then goes to the restaurant, he's there too. I understand they're invisible and all, but they're not know-it-all.

fk1dnm4,"I thought it was fantastic up until the end. I think they should have ended the film basically right after the scene of James/Cecilia in the police station. A following scene would have teased that it was actually Adrian the whole time and not Tom, and that he's still alive. That would have been a great setup for a sequel, as well as fueling some actual character development for everyone and some great context for Adrian's horribleness that was only really hinted at and told to us through exposition. There were too many questions raised with how it ended and I think ending it like this would have erased most of those. Imagine Cecilia overcoming him at the end of a sequel vs. at the end of this first movie, oh well. 

Side note: The only thing before the ending revenge scene that diminished the impact the movie had was showing the damaged suit too much. The most suspenseful thing about this film was never seeing him, that kind of went out the window when he is walking around glitching out. I think a better alternative to this would have been for the suit to only glitch when he either held Cecilia down and was speaking (like in the rain against the ambulance for example). Nitpicking though.",fafwsf

fk0m1di,"It is extremely rare for me to actually comment on other peoples post here in Reddit. I am the type of person who likes to just read reviews I’m here but I feel very inclined to give my opinion on this movie.

When I first saw the trailer released, I was rolling my eyes and just so annoyed that a movie like this had existed after seeing Hollow Man. I assume this movie was going to be so cheesy and I thought the trailer was garbage. Boy, was I wrong. I thought the trailer made of giving away too much but in my opinion, it didn’t. There is still a good chunk of the movie that is not revealed. I think I just had a feeling that it was going to be like hollow man and I was prejudging this movie without going in with eyes wide open. I thought it was a fun ride from start to finish. I like how it pulled you in immediately I don’t take forever for the tension to build. Maybe I wasn’t too emotionally attached to the other characters in the film, but I was attached enough to feel bad for them when something happened to them. I agree with other people on here that the use of the camera was pretty magnificent. I was constantly looking In the background for something to move or be out of place.

SPOLIERS FOR HOLLOW MAN...
...
...




 Going back to my concern that this would be similar to hollow man. If I’m wrong, someone please correct me. It has been many years since I’ve seen hollow man and my memory is terrible. But isn’t there a rape or sexual assault seen in Hollow man? That is one thing that really turns me off about a movie: rape. However, It doesn’t make me completely dismissive of a movie. I have sat through a movie that has one of the worst Rape scenes I’ve ever seen in cinema and I still find the movie to be quite great. And it’s like a 10 minute rape scene but it ties in very effectively with the rest of the movie. If hollow man did indeed have a rape or sexual assault scene, I feared that the invisible man was going to have this as well. In fact, when she explains how much he wanted a baby and how she was taking birth control, I had it more set in my mind that a rape scene was going to come sooner or later. When she gets back from the hospital and the doctor over the phone says the blood results and mentions that there is something else but isn’t sure if it should be discussed over the phone, I knew it was involving her being pregnant. My mind started playing tricks on me And I was trying to think of what it could possibly happen because my bright mind, It could’ve only happened after we knew that the suit became effective, LOL. And when she is in the hospital locked up, and that staff member tells her about the pregnancy, I truly thought maybe it had happened after she left him but they just decided to not show the scene but strongly hint at a rape scene. Then when the brother goes to visit her at the hospital and mentions how he switched all the birth control pills, I was pleasantly shocked. It is such a simple Thing to do if you’re brilliant, controlling, and sneaky. It isn’t hard to switch out something like that I’m sure when you’re a world leader in optics and have that high of intelligence along with a ton of money. Either way, I still found it quite smart and effective.

flizloi,"I enjoyed the film overall, and it's idea of invisibility is great, a man-made suit sounds alot better and makes more sense than some biological thing. The only part of the movie that bothered me (apart from minor plotholes) was the ending. Its understandable that Cecilia knew it was him based on knowing him, but for me it felt like I missed out on an important piece of evidence or a scene. Now I'm not saying that Adrian didn't stalk her or kill anyone, I'm saying that the viewers point of view is really similar to that of every other character in the movie, she just seems crazy and paranoid. 

Maybe this is what the writers were going for, maybe they wanted us to realize that sometimes you have to trust people no matter how insane it seems. But the ending seems like the writers had three different directions and couldn't decide.",fafwsf

Plot holes (or am I nitpicking lol)

If I remember correctly, they specifically made some effort to show Cecilia putting the diazepam in her bag and zipping it when leaving and then it somehow falls out of her bag when she gets in the car?

The attic load of evidence she didn’t know even attempt to take the phone or get it tracked

Sydney gets punched in the side of the head yet blames Cee who is 5ft away from her lying down and she’s looking right at her: don’t expect her to say it’s AG but come on

*not a plot per say but* her sister completely shuts her out after one email (that sounds like an angry child wrote it) despite knowing she’s been abused and tormented for years

Not a single camera or cctv in the restaurant like c’mon

Gets off Scott free for the abuse and not looked into once he returns and is no one questioning why he ‘appeared’ dead. Like did everyone just accept he was kidnapped despite their being a body.

Also not a plot hole but who plans the longest escape ever at the beginning",fafwsf

They couldve cut a few scenes out and make us unsure if it was a ghost movie or not until close to the end. Like adrian saying surprise. The case in the beginning, her going to investigate so early on.

The scene when she was in the attic and threw paint on adrian, i never jumped so hard at a scene before in my life. I wasnt expecting to see any physical form like that so soon, on top of the noise the suit made when paint splashed on it, also the paint itself just coming out of nowhere. Great scene.

fj4yvp4,"Things I liked: 
The opening scene, wow. A solid 10 minutes of suspense, setting up the story, the kicking of that dog bowl, and him running from the woods. Solid. All of it. Also some of the camera work throughout was great. Namely that spinning shot in the kitchen. 

Things I didn’t like:
Sadly, almost everything else. I thought it was terribly unrealistic. So here goes:

1. What even was the plot? I want to control you so I’ll kill everyone around you to have this baby? That felt.. jarring. 

2. That scene where she screams because he’s standing on the sheet, James immediately bursts through the door. Ok. Was he just waiting to come in?

3. The dog. If he’s dead and all the furniture is covered up, then why is the dog running free around this house? Wouldn’t someone have taken the dog out of there? Would that not have been top of mind for her when she realized he died? Also, the shock collar seemed like a big deal in the beginning, was it no longer important to him post-fake death?

4. The email. Ok. You’re sisters and supposedly close. Wouldn’t she text and be like wtf was that email?

5. When James left to get the daughter to safety, where exactly did they go? It’s like 4 in the morning and they’re someplace else.

6. Wouldn’t he have seen her take the pen and stick it to the ceiling? I mean he was in the room the whole time.

7. If he’s this world renowned scientist, wouldn’t there be media coverage over this bizarre ass suicide, then kidnap, then brother murder, yet there’s literally no media outside the gates of his house. 

8. When the cops were getting shredded two by two, why was that happening? They kept running around the corner like a video game. There are clearly cameras in the front room with other officers, why was it not all hands on deck? Also, you would think they would have called for backup like, immediately, yet an entire 15 minutes plays out from the time in the hall to when she was driving away in a stolen car, and no police following her to the house when she gets there to spray him with the fire extinguisher. Ok. 

9. Why is she getting a job right after this happened? Now is not the time. Maybe go easy and freelance first at 20 hours a week. 

10. Why would she not have taken pictures of the suit and sent them to everyone in her circle immediately upon seeing it? Or taken the suit. Like come on. 

11. On the same note, why wouldn’t she have sent James the images of her and the daughter sleeping? Like clearly she couldn’t have taken them at that angle, or without waking up the daughter. 

These are just some things that kept reminding me I was watching actors, and not immersed in a real story. Elizabeth Moss did great, but it just felt kind of goofy overall.",fafwsf

The next scene is the plothole: at the police station Sydney, James and Cecillia are discussing Cecillias future, However James is in doubt regarding the existence of the invisible suit. They guy who knows he clearly got beaten up by something invisible is doubting her, and even his daughter doesn't seem to believe and she just keeps silent. Hell, there was even a guard left alive in the parking lot who saw the suit malfunctioning. All James says is that ""We have a bunch of witnesses saying they've seen something strange"". WTF dude?

However after I got back from the theater last night I started thinking on the seen with her on the attic and how weird the logistics of that scene was.

So did Adrian plant his own privat phone up there and planned for Celia to call it at some point so she could find it? 
What if someone else found the phone before her like James or his daughter? Did Adrian blindly hope that no one would try to call his phone not even phonesellars? 
So he leaves his phone up there fully charged and go and gets a burner phone, but why? Was it only so that he could send that text to his own phone when Celia found it? Or was it so no one else would know he's alive? But his brother was in on it so he could have used his private phone to call his brother, so who the hell was he going to call with the burner phone? 
It gets even weirder if it was planned all along cause then Adrian would have had to walk around at all times with the burner in his invisible pocket just in case Celia would get the idea to climb up there. What if she hadnt called the phone for another week? Then he would have had to climb up there and charged the damn thing. 

Just a minor detail. Movie still great tho.",fafwsf

fld2v9u,"The Invisible Man starts strong with a tense opening scene of an abused wife’s escape from her husband and it maintains that quality for about the first hour of its run time. Tension is built simply but effectively with shots of empty spaces which might be occupied by an invisible presence and the heroine’s sanity is chipped away. But even in the better first half it tends to undermine its assets. Why are the invisible suit’s cameras audible sometimes and his presence obvious? Why does Cecilia make certain ridiculous choices? The better part of the movie culminates in a truly surprising murder scene and then it dips into sci-fi action with even more logical leaps, cliches or overlong sequences. The tension of an empty space in a room is set aside in favor of a flickering CG silhouette killing security guards left and right. It would have been better to set up the abusive marriage and the husband’s sociopathic tendencies in a longer first act and then end the movie much sooner.

She was gripping the knife handle as if she picked it up by herself.

This magical suit gives him super speed too or what? Like did he freeze time, unfurled her fingers and wrapped them around the handle like Quicksilver? 

And, I guess it's an exoskeleton from The Elysium too because he's throwing heavy tables around like they're made of paper mache.

He's not The Predator. His brother was beating up the cop in his house when his one kick could have easily sent him flying back.

fn49rti,"Here's an alternate theory to the movie plot:

Cecilia could have been a violent, manipulating, and abusive person in the relationship while showing mental insanity throughout the movie. I mean it makes sense as she gained the most in the outcome by killing all parties for money and control.

1. She manipulated him by drugging him at the beginning of the movie which may have induced his only violent scene of chasing her when the car alarm went off.
2. She hit the little girl causing the cop and his daughter to flee in terror.
3. She hunted a person into the attic while using a knife with intent to do harm.
4. She wrote a nasty letter to her sister.
5. She killed her sister (got locked up in a mental ward for it).
6. She manipulated her boyfriend's brother to break her out of the mental ward.
7. She showed (or implied) controlling characteristics by knowing all the combinations in the house, how her boyfriend's technology worked, how boyfriends scientific knowledge worked, how the house camera and security system works, how the dog is loyal to her, how dog showed aggression to him.
8. She killed her scientist boyfriend's brother.
9. She killed her boyfriend.

I'm sure there was more missing. The actor did not do a good job convincing the viewer to the movie's summary plot, so Cecilia's nonchalant acting throughout the movie makes this a real theory.",fafwsf
fo8f9b3,I liked it. It's a call back to 90s TV movies. No offence to Elizabeth but she's really miscast here. They should have made her character higher status and cast a more conventionally beautiful actress. Make thr character a very successful model or athlete or socialite so that his obsession can make sense. A trophy he doesn't wasn't on loose.

fjthg53,"The beginning/set-up of this movie was fantastic and had you guessing if she was actually crazy or not. But the latter part was nothing short of frustrating and didn't leave me satisfied.

First of all, what the hell were the guards at the hospital doing? They were like NPCs; they didn't even bother trying to look for the invisible dude or shoot at where they think he is. Instead, they just stared at the other guards being beaten up until they've had their turn. With the security camera pointed at the hallway and all the guards being killed - you would think the guys at the front watching the security cams (you see them as the main character exits the hospital) would do something about it. The scene outside kills me inside as well. The part where the guard was disarmed and spared. The lady had so much time to do something while he had his back turned on her but she stayed pinned to the vehicle until the invisible guy walked away? Come on.

What about the scene when she found the suit. She had a phone on her, she could have recorded a video of it as it revealed itself or took pictures to show the police, OR better yet **WEAR IT**?? In which case, it would've been a solid ""good luck finding me bitch"". But I guess there's gotta be struggles in the movie... 

The ending scene wasn't as satisfying either. I felt that there could have been more to it than that. Adrian didn't really say anything that they could have used as evidence. Especially since the ""surprise"" thing he said was between the two of them.

--

Overall, I felt that revealing that she was crazy at the end would've been a better ending. You may say that it's predictable, but they could have made it so that she was just seeing things differently. The killings could have been her doing, but they'd only show her point of view as a crazy person where she thinks it's Adrian doing everything. Could have tied in with the scene where the kid was slapped, because she said ""*she* slapped me!"". I'd rate this movie 6/10. The setup, the theme, and some of the scenes (such as the sister getting killed) are absolutely amazing. But the latter part leaves a lot to be desired.",fafwsf

fl673ir,"I expected better from Leigh Whannell. I was disappointed with this movie. I predicted the ""twist"" early on. Wasn't trying to. It was just too obvious. And the dog barking at the invisible man...Whether it can see him or not, the dog's not gonna bark AT one of its owners like that, especially when both are present. It didn't bark at all when Cecilia left the house at the beginning of the movie. That's a dog barking moment. Suit or no suit, invisible or not invisible, a dog is gonna know its owner. Clearly it had been hanging around the house that entire time. No dog is gonna leave a reliable source of food and water and SOMEONE had to be giving it to him. Someone so familiar that the dog WOULDN'T bark at him.

Another dead giveaway was the explanation the brother gave about the trust. I would've thought that would've been his motivation: get rid of Cecilia under the specific terms of the trust so he'd become the inheritor. When you think about it, that's a simple plot and probably the route the movie should've taken. But they threw in the pregnancy angle which was weak and not followed up on at the end of the movie. Security cameras everywhere in the looney bin, including a manned security station in the lobby viewing EVERYTHING, but they just kept sending guard after guard to their doom instead of locking the place down. There's a LOT more wrong with this movie but I'll stop there. Five out of ten stars from me. They should've gone the simple route which works better for Whannell. He could've done more with less.

Tom could have locked up Adrian and harass C at the house for revenge or sport. and at the end, we see a changed Adrian that ultimately meets the same fate as his brother.

&#x200B;

WARNING   SPOILERS   BELOW

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. Who was James to Cecelia?
2. Why was she sharing a bed with the young teen?  Couldn't she sleep on the couch?
3. How could Adrian have faked his death - it needs a proper coroner's report?
4. Every adult needs to sneeze, cough, fart or get tummy indigestion noises - also when did he sleep?
5. Why didn't she have lots of bruises from Adrian/Tom beating her the first time in James house especially when he picked her up by the neck?
6. Why didn't she keep insisting that people watch all the CCTV?  If I thought someone was    trying to get me I would carry a second phone and try to record all objects moving around.  She could set it up in the dark unless Adrian had night vision goggles.
7. Why didn't her sister believe she didn't send the email?  Just say her account was hacked.
8. Why didn't the police check the CCTV of the restaurant?
9. She could have grabbed any one of the poor security guards guns and shot at Tom/Adrian as it was obvious where he was - his suit was floating in and out of vision and he was carrying a gun at one stage so if it was pointed in a certain direction then he would have had his back to her.
10. Why did Tom make it so obvious that he was going to attack the kid?  Why not do it more sneaky.
11. At the end, did she keep the dog?  He was following her outside?  Also why have an electrocuting collar on a guard dog?  The whole point for a guard dog is that they bark.

&#x200B;

All in all it was a very good movie.

BUT what do you guys think of alternate endings:

It's more subtle if there really is someone following her and at the end you never really know if it's in her mind.

She does kill Adrian but again weird stuff keeps happening so maybe it wasn't him after all.

&#x200B;

OR she does kill Adrian but is so traumatised she is house bound and won't leave the house with only James calling in to see she is ok?",fafwsf

fj9koku,"Thought it was great, but did leave me thinking *a lot* about how it could have been so much better. With a few redrafts it could have been a genuine rewatchable cult classic rather than that interesting but slightly shoddy TV movie feel.   

Complicating things with the brothers was really unnecessary and distracted from the main theme of the film for the sake of slight twists and ambiguity.   

There's something frustrating about an intelligent character not being believed, then the character just being annoyed rather than intelligently proving their situation - which she could have done over and over. Using cameras, taking the phone in the attic, laying foil all over the floor (surely *hearing* the guy would be more effective than watching over coffee granules?)   

I'd have preferred it to be called ""An Invisible Man"", and make the guy a total inadequate loser obsessed with attention and validation, like a metaphor for all the trolls out there, who somehow acquires the suit. I think that would have been more interesting than a Tony Stark character using this tech for petty vengeance.",fafwsf

fl4sxkq,"I loved the film to be honest.

The film made me have a lot of questions:

1. Did Adrian rape Cecilia after his apparent suicide?  
How I came to this question was that once it was revealed she was pregnant, I assume based on his previous abusive behaviour, he would have raped her in order to make her pregnant. The timeline the nurse indicated had me question how she got pregnant.
2. Was Tom in on all of this? Did he plan with Adrian?  
Either Adrian coerced or threatened Tom to participate in his games, I believe Tom was in even on their relationship. Once he mentioned about going back to him and giving him the child, I began to question his character. But him whispering that part also puzzled me.
3. What if Adrian was innocent?  
Now, this scenario seems highly unlikely given his behaviour and his words chosen during the dinner. However, I couldn't feel some sort of ounce of guilt for him. What if Tom was the mastermind of it all and Adrian was a victim of this scheme.
4. What is the meaning of Cecilia in Adrian's life?  
Much like Cecilia said, he could have any woman. Why was he so intent on tormenting her and wanting to have a baby with her? He could have easily found someone else to impregnate and move on, but he insisted on keeping Cecilia.
5. Who killed Emily?  
Although it may seem obvious that Adrian killed her, I truly believe it was Tom who did it. Due to the unmasking scene, it was revealed that Tom was the one to attack and kill the guards, and wanting to go after James and Sydney. It never seemed like Adrian had the intention of wanting to go after those around her.
6. What made Adrian so controlling and abusive?  
Was Tom really the mastermind and controlled Adrian throughout his life? Or were they abused as children? Or was this really Adrian's natural behaviour?
7. Was this the only incident?  
I suspect this may have happened with another woman. Although it wasn't as intricate and planned as with Cecilia, I think another woman was also a victim.",fafwsf
fj26kr2,"I think the trailer and the ending really bog this film down. It was enjoyable but not a good film. 

First is that Jason Blum thinks that a lot of scenes need to be shown in the trailer. Yes, there were a ton of scenes without what was shown in the trailer. But the trailer still ruined the experience. You can see the dude wearing a body suit *in the trailer.* I thought it would have fun to learned there was a suit from the movie, not the trailer. Even when Get Out came out, Jordan Peele had to fight for key scenes not being included in the trailer. 

I'm not a fan of the ending. To me, this isn't some artsy film where it should be left up to ambiguity. I'm not looking for a happy ending. I'm looking for all the loose ends to be tied up nicely. As the audience, we don't really know if there was a second Invisible Man. For Moss's character to just kill Adrian because he *still might be the Invisible Man.* It taints her character and makes Adrian look sympathetic.

And if someone could explain the brother's motivation that would be great.",fafwsf
fj92kcr,"Glad they ended up not putting the boyfriend in a lot of scenes, that actor was really *really* bad. He was like a network TV drama actor. 

Overall the movie was pretty solid. The restaurant scene was killer, it was a bit corny how she instantly fell over dead but I can look past that.

The worst part was the restaurant scene though. You're telling me no one saw a knife floating through the restaurant? Or does the invisible suit have pockets? Either way, does this restaurant not have cameras? And how did he put the knife in her hand so easily? Like if I think I'm being stalked by an invisible ex, and I just watched my sister's throat get cut, and suddenly something is trying to lift my arm and shove a blade into my grip, I think I'm probably going to resist somewhat and not just let it happen like a puppet.",fafwsf

A lot of things like this happened throughout the movie that just wasn’t well written and took short cuts like when she called an Uber and the Uber got there in 1 min.

Overall, the story was okay but I find it hard to believe he and his brother would go through all the trouble of faking his death just so he could stalk her. The suit is weird and I’m not even sure how it even works. The action, thrills, and suspense was good. Scary? No.

Also he has billions in optic tech in his house after his death, who was he doing it for? No one knew he was making the suit and wanted to get it before anyone else?

The whole movie was about Cecilia escaping an abusive relationship, but her abuser tracks her down and follows her wherever she goes, taking away her loved ones or driving them apart.

When she rejected the offer to go back to the abuser and decides to fight back I thought that was cool, she's fighting against the abuse.

But then the movie ends with her murdering her abuser as revenge which just feels wrong, morally. It would've been better if the movie just ended on the previous scene, but with it really being Adrian and not Tom, where with the help of her friends she managed to fight back against the abuser and kill him, ending the relationship.",fafwsf
fizwu1a,"My full review: [https://cityofgeek.com/2020/02/28/invisible-man-bob/](https://cityofgeek.com/2020/02/28/invisible-man-bob/)

Found it just about perfection. Tense as all hell and never really let up.

&#x200B;

Whannel uses his camera with an amazing hand, using minimal cuts to ratchet it up, amazing bearing we're dealing with someone invisible so there isn't much to see. But we're still looking for it, in every frame.  Very sparing with the actual invisible actions helped build that and kept it from being silly.

&#x200B;

It's telling for when it did start to full one-person-playing-against-nothing with Moss vs whoever was in the suit in the kitchen the audience was silent and digging it. Not one person in the sold out show laughed. If those scenes weren't handled well, it'd lose the audience and the movie would be over essentially. But it held on. Later when we see the floating knife in the restaurant, it was a shock not a laugh.

&#x200B;

Moss was fantastic, as was the rest of the cast. She really sold the broken, beaten woman recovering from years of abuse. She's essentially a metaphoric invisible woman against literal invisible men.  Of course that is a metaphor to the abuses in a marriages are rarely seen straightforward,.  As happens all too often in real life, no one believes what she is going through, and we even see Adrian almost painting a victim too.

&#x200B;

I loved the sound design, especially noteworthy as the sound has to give more since the terrorizing is invisible. Hearing it it Dolby, it was awesome hearing the camera clicks before we knew what they were. Lots of very subtle sound cues helped build the movie.",fafwsf

fjpwhkv,"I liked a lot of stuff in this movie! The opening scene was great!! The characters were really awesome. I can forgive most of the logical failings except one and it is a huge one. If you make an insanely high tech invisible suit you would put a LoJack on that thing. I mean I guess maybe since it was so secret and he was planning to use it nefariously maybe he didn't want any possibility for someone else to track it, but bro you had 3 suits. At least LoJack the ones you aren't using.

As soon as she hid it, I was like shit... I can't forgive that one if it stays hidden.

Also the plot armored guard in the parking lot at the hospital who just got shot in the arm was pretty BS. The invisible Man had plenty of time to eliminate him as the only other living witness besides C. I guess it didn't really matter anyway considering the hospital for sure has hallway cams.

Edit: Overall 8/10 super tense enjoyable movie!",fafwsf
fjwwbmb,"Above average film in terms of craft. The long tracking shots as well as the camera sitting still filming what looks to be absolutely nothing going on increase the suspense and dread of thinking maybe the invisible man will doing something interesting here.

The acting is top notch. Never felt these actors were just acting.

The pacing is excellent. After the introductory sequences, the film jumps right into the horror. Probably because it knows the title is The Invisible Man and wants to do its best to please the audience's appetite rather than waste precious film time on dubious elements. I was particularly impressed with how we are getting teased with the invisible man's goings-on in just the first act.

The film had nice touches and surprises. I didn't expect it to be a suit that made him invisible. Nor did I expect the rape pregnancy. Or the restaurant murder for that matter.

Then there were times it was fairly cliche. Like her keeping her computer without password protection. Or the girls feeling helpless and crying when the men are fighting the invisible man and losing.

The revenge plotting in the third act was a turn off. Felt like something out of a Death Wish movie.

The plot holes are fairly obvious. Like the relationship between James and Cecelia. Or Adrian faking his death given the extensive CSI treatment crime scenes are handled with. Or how Adrian's brother intended to get Cecilia out of a murder conviction by agreeing to his terms. Or how did Cecelia manage to find a suit that fit her? Or how did Cecelia manage to overpower Adrian and suicide him?

Overall, still a well made film and worth seeing in theaters.",fafwsf

Like outside in the cold. It would have to be super super cold for breath to be that visible. Definitely was computer enhanced, and for what? Just so we can see the dude breath once next to her? Lame

I watch a lot of movies these days. Most of them generic/average. For someone that doesn’t go to the movies a lot, I can see them liking this film. But for me, I thought it was alright

Edit: also the scene in the hospital with the officers just getting popped in 1 hit. And for some reason they all said NOTHING. Rofl, even the jacked black guy when he was getting beat up in the house he couldn’t say a single word. You would think that if there’s an invisible guy you’d be yelling like “WHAT THE FUCK HES INVISIBLE” and then running or some shit. Nope, the guards were coming out in pairs rofl. And each time I was thinking “oh great, more useless officers that will die in 1 hit, awesome”

Best scenes for me were the paint scene, psych ward fight scene, and the scene where it’s revealed to be his brother in the house.

I actually had a feeling it was his brother in the house and not Adrian. In the psych ward, he clearly had damaged his suit to the point where you would see him once every 5 seconds or so from a glitch. We knew the brother was in on it and that there were multiple suits. Once he entered the house and there was no glitch, I knew it had to be someone else. I guess it’s possible he was carrying multiple suits but what a time waste to get it on and off while you know you’re being hunted.

But wouldn't accepting it also be her admitting that she needed Adrian, or at least his money? It's as if the moment she accepted the money, he won. She knew his headspace well enough that she might have been better off just saying no and maybe even leaving the city forever. She had no problem going out and looking for work.

And overall I thought the film was just okay. The way the characters acted became less and less believable as things went on. The knife scene was comedic and by the end everyone (including Moss) seemed to have super strength and speed, but still somehow not be all that bright. You know, if I had suits that could turn people invisible, I would definitely keep track of all them (even the prototypes), as well as destroy any evidence of their existence.

They removed the focus from the invisible man and the effects invisibility has on his psyche and decided to focus on the story of an abused girlfriend. You don't even need the IP at this point.

And how lame was that suit? Guess the movie should be called The Invisible Suit not The Invisible Man. It's like they were not creative enough to come up with a way for the characters to beat the Invisible Man other than HIS SUIT MALFUNCTIONS.

I will say though I think overall I was disappointed. It's a little melodramatic for my liking, and it kind of all feels like a murder mystery that was made for TV, or based off a bad novel. And while there were some unexpected twists, it felt predictable. My eyes rolled a few times throughout. And besides Elizabeth Moss, I really didn't like the casting. Especially the dude who played her ex, he felt really miscast. 

Good for a watch, was entertaining enough. and had some good thrills. Don't think I'll watch it again though.

There are 4 really cool scenes spread out across the whole movie. The rest of the movie is suspense which was working but my expectations kept getting in the way.

Of course there's the opening scene where he breaks the car window to grab C, but other than that, the only other scene where we see him is the end, when he is apologetic for previously not treating her nicely.  He seemed like a decent guy in that scene. 

Meanwhile, we have Tom, whom visited her in the psych ward and threatened her basically, combined with Tom going to Jason's house, and beating the shit out of Jason and his daughter. Add to that him saying earlier in the movie that he hated his brother, which gives motive for him to set it all up. 

So if you add up the things the movie actually shows you, it's not out of the realm of possibility that Tom was the lone wolf actor in this.

At the time of writing the film has made $124.5 million !!! ????. I'm gobsmacked I can't think of a film so devoid of tension. 

from the trailer, we already know there's an Invisible Man as we already see him in his suit when she chucks the paint on him and the film is even called...... The Invisible Man, they could  maybe of had the audience guessing along and interested had the movie  called ""Paranoid"" or ""stalked"" or anything without giving away the ""twist"".

They could easily have had plot based around if the titular character was even real or if Cecilia was insane from all the abuse but thanks to the title and the audience knowing in the first 10 mins she isn't making it up and he actually is real, it kind of made the film tensionless and pointless.

I saw this at the Cinema a few weeks back and while it was well cast, well filmed and well edited but I just can't believe how much press its getting and how on earth it made that much money ???

fj35i0t,"No one else has mentioned the ending part with the cop brother in law, his expression really felt like he didn’t believe Cecelia, and that he was disgusted by her/didn’t think it was right that she killed Adrian. When she said what did it sound like? And he said it sounded like he killed himself, he saw the bag, and he looked inside and he looked disappointed and then he disappears! I really thought he was going to shoot her behind her back. He went back into Adrians house! Why?? 

The brother didn’t really react to the suit, and still questioned everything after he and his daughter almost died.

I’m thinking there’s room for a theory/maybe a sequel where the brother in law was friends with Adrian/ was paid off by Adrian and in on it the whole time. He really reacted badly to everything and, I feel like there’s no way the attic could have all the Adrian stuff without the family knowing. Also why was their ladder broken? Maybe because Adrian was using it so much to get into the attic? Or maybe the cop put the stuff in the attic? It doesn’t make sense that Adrian was able to be in the house so much, and also feeding the dog back at his place. They’re far away, and I don’t know how he drives with the suit! Also, Adrian’s death/crime scene was highly suspicious (who was that if Adrian was in the basement?) and I think someone from the police force would have to be in on it.

The cop just conveniently was so unaware of everything and against Cecelia. Trying to defend Adrian at the end with the crazy basement thing. It was too easy for Adrian to get into their home imo. Plus the cop had motives (money for his daughter,) and maybe he was friends with Adrian.",fafwsf

It wasn’t necessary to know how abusive Adrian was when we see how much of a sociopath he was throughout the movie and how good of a friend James was.

I thought of this when she went back to his house at the end and he seemed like a genuine guy, it would shock us thinking he would be a complete animal but in the end he was a good guy and it would play on the audiences mind.

Scenes from where the camera pans away from one area to another leaves the viewers constantly glued to the environment/background, trying to determine whether an object moved as a result of the antagonist.

I didn't like how slow and quiet it was. I had to keep turning up the volume to hear what they were saying and it felt like they were ripping off A Quiet Place. Even the studio logos were dead silent. Most of the scares were just sound effects. The movie needed less of that and more invisibility stuff.

I really didn't like the ending. I get what they were going for now, she knows him well enough that she can tell when he's lying, but that went over my head while I was watching it so it just looked like she was killing him without any proof he was lying. Also, how did she put the suit on, kill him, go back to where she was, and then take the suit off that fast? Maybe I'm wrong, but I think she grabbed the knife herself instead of making him pick it up. The camera would see the knife floating around.

fj6408r,"Ok so hear me out. I left the theater just now wondering what if it was Cecilia the whole time?  That look right at the end could have been taken as a look of freedom but it seemed just smug to me. What do we know of her?

1.) She is a very clever planner. She put together a whole escape right under Adrian’s nose. 

2.) As she was escaping she stopped and looked right at the invisible suit which she supposedly didn’t know existed. 

3.) She went to James’s house, a location where no one would have known she would go and the door was never open long enough for him to get inside with someone else. He isn’t that skinny. But somehow he knew where she was hiding and got inside a deadbolt locked house. 

4.) She can cry on cue and uses it at the end when at the table with Adrian and afterwards as well when calling the police. 

5.) She knows that Adrian would have reached out to his brother lawyer right away. She seems to be on good terms with him until he is just doing her job and then she flips on him. 

6.) All the bad things we hear about Adrian did come straight from Cecila’s mouth. 

So here is what I think could be what happened. I think Cecilia orchestrated the whole thing. Adrian might have actually abused her but it is possible he didn’t and she just wanted his money. Maybe in a fight he mouthed off about his suit. She realized what that tech could mean money wise. So she orchestrates her escape. She drugs Adrian fakes the pics of his death and ties him up. Sends those pics to Tom. She uses her very clearly demonstrated knowledge of Adrian’s codes and passwords to email Tom pretending to be Adrian and knowing he has no spine she gets him to “stalk” her.  

She tips Tom off to where she is hiding and provides instructions on what to do and when. she then let’s him in to the house, then she puts on an act. Meanwhile she has Tom building up evidence that proves Adrian is alive. Things like the photos and his cell phone. Why else would she not call the cops once she “finds” the evidence?  She even buys a new ladder as a way of getting up into the attic. 

She drugs herself right before the interview knowing it is too fast working to have been done before she left the house. When the nurse calls with her diagnosis the nurse tips her off about the baby, she emails her sister, Gets Tom to murder her.  How else would he have known where she ran off to after the house?  She tips Tom off about the baby and leaves proving her innocence up to him. He chooses to beat up a bunch of cops but doesn’t kill them all to leave witnesses to get her free. And boy does it work. 

She “chases” Tom through the town knowing full well where he is going and gives him enough time to get ahead of her. There is no way she’d lose sight of him she knows where James lives after all. So she gives Tom some lead time. She calls to get James there, tips off  the cops where to find Adrian, and sets the stage for her triumphant entrance where she kills “Tom the bad guy” and saves James and Sydney thus guaranteeing that James will help her later. 

Then she goes to see Adrian. She gets James there to provide her an alibi and to use him in a coverup. Adrian offers her all the food options and she chooses steak to ensure there will be knives on the table. And then she kills Adrian. 

Doing this she not only gets her portion of the money, she now also gets Tom’s portion since he loses his due to having committed a crime even if he hadn’t died.  And then she takes the suit, convinces James to lie for hr. She just pulled of the perfect murder and theft. From the beginning she played us. 

What do you think?",fafwsf

The film is okay but nothing great. *Hollow Man* was better. Too many inconsistencies, plot holes.

Why would a sister that is not out on a limb with her sibling just immediately accept an email slagging her off is actually from her sister, in this day/age where people get hacked all the time? She did not even give her enough of the benefit of the doubt to let her try to defend herself.

There wasn't enough of an effect in the pouring rain to show someone was there. If it was just drizzling maybe, but it was teeming down, yet there was no evidence something was blocking the rain fall.

Why did nobody notice a floating knife in the restaurant? Okay maybe nobody was looking at their table. But why did Cecelia not notice the knife floating in between her and her sister, like her sister did? And why was Cecelia holding her hand open so that the knife could be put in to her palm after her sister's throat was cut? And why did she close her fist around the knife that is suddenly put in to her palm, people just don't garb things put in their palms?

What's the point of the attic? Like seriously what is the point, the scene had no bearing on the film apart from giving her the opportunity to dump the milkiest gallon of paint I've ever seen on top of him?

Really? We're seriously expected to believe he shut himself inside a solitary cell with her all night?

I'm not even going to think about whether the brothers were working together in the hospital escape, attack on Sydney, because I really just don't care about the film plot tbh

The change to the story to make it about a woman escaping an abusive controlling relationship was quite boring. The invisible man should be about world power, or as in *Hollow Man* revenge albeit insanely twisted, not about domestic violence.

If I want to watch a film about controlling domestic relationships, I'd watch a film that is set in reality, depicting the real horror of a person fighting for their sanity, freedom and life. Like *Sleeping With The Enemy*, or for a plot twist *Men Don't Tell*.

The security system and his controlling of her came from her doing literally what she imagined him doing throughout the movie and that's how he responded, trying to find the invisible man, getting paranoid thinking someone's always watching him etc, etc. He figured out it was her the night she escaped. Why was their no follow up to him punching through the window? Because he was the victim. This is also how she was able to get his password she literally watched him enter it on the computer many times, invisibly over his shoulder. She has gone through the usual psychological break i.e. god complex that all previous Invisible Men did in their movies. Her escape was her trying to break free of the suit and the power she felt with it on. Since the movie is shown from her perspective we see what she sees and not all of it was real ( a little like in the joker we never know whats real and whats imagined). She really did lash out and hit Sydney. She slit her sisters throat in the restaurant and she killed her husband this is why she walks away with a suit in the end.

**Does anyone else think that Adrian might not have done it with the way he's talking at the end?**  

People are saying that he had a ""knowing smile"" when he says 'surprise' at the end but I thought it was extremely inconspicuous.  He says it super casually without any malice in his tone of voice.  Maybe frequent use of the word ""surprise"" was just a quirk the brothers developed from the way they were raised?  

How many suits were there?  Are we supposed to assume that he didn't know that one of the suits were missing?

Also at the end the CGI staff messed up because after she killed the boyfriend guy, and was talking to the Black guy, afterwards you can see the Black Guy turn partially transparent. What the heck was up with that? Did the editing staff not catch that hiccup?      
            
Good movie besides these above points. Would be nice if the ending was left on a cliff hanger so we could get a sequel just not with the main character acting annoying like she did in this movie...",fafwsf

* never explained who the cop character was to cecilia. spent a chunk of the movie thinking it was her BIL and niece
* why focus on the dog in the beginning - taking off the collar, obviously showing her putting it in her bag only for that to never come up again
* how could the guy see in a suit that's fully covered in cameras?

She plans to leave Adrian forever but she hasn’t worked for years and knows he will never let her. She “escapes” with her sister and convinces James she’s agoraphobic. But, she returns to her house to fake Adrian’s death. She’s the one who locks him in the basement and sets up a $5 mil trust for herself. She convinces jellyfish Tom, in Adrian’s name, to torment her with the motive of eventually killing Tom, the man “tied to” Adrian’s money. 

Cecilia tells James that she “has something” that will prove her innocence but she doesn’t tell SWAT about it when they storm the house. She plans, from the beginning, to return and kill Adrian on camera so she can escape him forever with enough $$ to live comfortably. 

I can’t decide how Emily’s murder fits in. I do think she sent the email to her sister, all of their dialog suggests she has an Adrian-esq relationship with her. Cinematically, Tom kills Emily but maybe Cecilia actually committed the murder herself which is why she whispered to bring Emily closer to her? Thoughts?",fafwsf

fjfi2iy,"Ok so I entered with immensely critical opinions, I technically didn’t want to see it but my friend offered to pay for my ticket and what am I meant to do ? Say no and let the ticket burn ?

The trailer looked god awful and others had told me it was terrible. **** (read below)

I rate the film a 6/10.

If you look at it from a filmmakers point of view (I am no filmmaker, I’m just assuming). It is a masterpiece, the long shots of the empty corners of the rooms when you expect something to happen but doesn’t was very jarring and annoyed the hell out of me and kept me on the edge but that was the whole point. 

The music was intense and unnerving, the scene where she tenses up when a jogger is running on her path put me in the shoes of someone suffering from PTSD. And I could not possibly leave out the scene with her sister’s death. Caught me completely off guard and was just what the film needed when it was starting to get boring, I didn’t need a pair of strong characters fighting the enemy, I was happy with experiencing the trauma the main character felt by having to fight alone in this and it once again put me on the edge, the fact that she was battling alone.

Moss’s acting was once again phenomenal but I am sick of seeing her to be honest with you, I could’ve enjoyed this film with any other actor but props to her, she can portray a gaslight victim losing her mental stability beautifully and like in other examples she once again shows she can play a vulnerable character but also once who is very clever and can take on the challenges thrown at her with her witt and tactical thinking. Scenes where she’s fighting invisible man ? Not sure how much of that effort is down to her acting and how much of it is from the VFX crew and director but I was mesmerised by how well she played it.

Now, the film’s entire plot and story is a little stupid.
Their relationship dynamic doesn’t make sense, things finish as if everything is complete because it doesn’t leave you with any questions but it doesn’t answer anything either, was Adrian really kidnapped or not ? Was Adrian’s brother in on it for personal gains or for his brother. It’s clever, collect footage of him when he’s committing suicide to wrap things up, sure, but then leave just like that, walk into the night as if nothing happened ? You don’t have to be that cool, just stay there and help the viewer figure it out, am I making sense ? Anyway. I hated Aldis Hodge, we didn’t need a character that likeable, he didn’t have to be that charismatic and perfect, he literally had no flaws during the whole film and took away from the already thin realism of the film. Just thinking about it logically the entire film doesn’t make sense.

Personally, if I could rewrite the script, I would completely take away the jarring horror elements, and made it a less scary but more intense mystery where everything is explained in the end and less people die because I hated how quickly the judges said “ok so there really is an invisible man in a suit, she can go” that would have to be investigated and she would still have to be in custody for some time.

****yes the trailer was god awful but that’s because it gave me certain expectations that would’ve disappointed me but the film was heavily different from what you expect from the trailer and that made go back and rewatch the trailer several times to get the brilliance of it, I’m not sure if there were deleted scenes or if it was a fake trailer on purpose but it once again caught me off guard and I sort of loved it.",fafwsf

Of  course we DONT KNOW WHY she is running away, but the scene is painted as  the white male as the aggressor.

Anyway  she escapes and is picked up by her sister...who is also white.. who  seems to be dating a black man who has a Asian looking daughter.. Also,  she took the 5million and started handing it out to the asian girl.  SO  what we see here portrayed is women - go marry a rich man, thats STILL  YOUR NUMBER 1 goal since your great great great grandmother had to do in  order to survive in the 1800s and great depression, ww1 etc... But of  course the feminist driven media are all about saying how white males  are the problem.  They hammer this in by making the black dude like  totally awesome as well.  Kinda over this social programming that  hollywood think is woke these days. This is exactly like the millennial  whoop that is in every song these days - google it.    I am still yet to  find out what role she played in this marriage break up because im not  an idiot that just believes all women without some evidence here.

* Was the Evil Adrian able to bypass Coroner reports / Police / Autopsy / newspapers and FAKE his own Suicide that easily in 2020??! RWWEALLY???? I don’t think so!!!!!!! 
* Director Dumbass does not even show the audience  how Adrian really manipulated his evil brother Tom! Absolutely  NO evidence of MOTIVE to harm Cecilia at all!!!!!! 
* Just another shit movie to champion the “MeeToo” Women and their Fanatical crusade against abusive relationships!!!!!!! MAGA TRUMP!!!! 
* Now you have crazy vegan activist fans who want to propose that Cecilia was the insane one and the entire story is just a hallucination!???!!! GIVE ME A BREAK 

So basically Adrian uses his own brother to harm Cecilia using his abusive psycho behavior with the use of Invisible Suit but she plays the revenge on him by using another extra Invisible to kill him in the end and truly realize his faked suicide! Instead, we as audience are supposed to just cheer one another because of the stupid, lovable dog that PURPOSELY was not harmed? How cheap! 

* BUT the movie SUCKS  because Adrian just dies clean! NO pain, no suffering! Where is the revenge in that? YAWN!

Their dynamic is basically that Cecilia only calls on Emily when she really needs her but they don't spend much time together besides that.

Adrian preys on that dynamic with the fake email. He knows how strained the relationship is and uses what he correctly assumes Emily feels (""my sister only cares about me when she needs something"") to his advantage. So when she gets the email it's pretty much just the logical extreme of how she sees their relationship at that time.",fafwsf

Then you also had the smaller issue of Cecilia having an alibi on being busy when the email was sent. She went to go see Tom with James in the scene before.

fj4z6r2,"I actually LOVED the jump scares in this movie because they were 1) Utilized sparingly and 2) Used in conjecture with the suspenseful/anxiety inducing atmosphere. Most horror movies that rely on jump scares use them wrongly. Here, the dog bowl is used to push the narrative of her getting away and making that scene have more anxiety because of the loud noise, and we get to be scared with her. Attic scene is again, more tension building with knowing he is actually there and waiting for something to happen. And of course, the restaurant scene doesn't need to be discussed more than it has in the thread already, but obviously that was used well too lol.",fafwsf
fj5mxu0,That part got me so good I freaked out lol. Then just thinking about how close to her he was so many times and we couldn’t see him... like when he took the blanket off her and Sydney sleeping but you could see him stepping on the blanket and walking towards her when she was trying to grab it.. the cold breath of air when he was standing right behind her outside at night.. ew it all made me feel so uncomfortable and on edge the whole time.,fafwsf

To explain how we seem to tick differently, that email for example. I explained it away by an already strained relationship and that was the final straw. Like the abuse/ gaslighting went on for years, and she probably actively drove her sister away, and her picking Cee up was the final chance she gave Cee. And a short while later Cee didn't seem overly grateful when her sister showed up at her hide away. 'I asked you for one thing! To stay away!' No 'Why are you here? We talked about this.' Just instantly blaming her, never thinking that maybe she has a very valid reason. Like her sister *didn't* have her back for a very long time. (again, could just be the effects of her abusive relationship) But that doesn't speak to a trustful sibling relationship. Maybe to Sister that was the final straw. 'I got her out. She's still a cunt. I don't have to deal with further abuse on her part. She's save after all.' Pent up frustration or something.

Grown women, young women would have, have had, and do throw themselves at him. He has no reason to keep an involuntary sex cult. He could set a price of $500 and people would pay to be in his sex cult voluntarily. And yet...

We could talk about the many female teachers who have sexually assulted their students. We all talk about how hot they are. Because they're reasonably good looking women who could have had a large pick of men. Why steal the innocence of a child? 

Abusers don't care about power in general. They care about power very specifically.

Even if you don’t believe the change in cadence, tone, and subtle emphasis of the singular word (which someone as murderously a control freak wouldn’t accidentally do), his reaction to having his throat slit by an invisible person says everything. He understands he lost and his unbridled anger (rather than reaction of surprise and sadly not understanding) says more than the word. He understood she had used the suit and rather than give a reaction of “why?” he gives one of “how dare you?” Compare his reaction to her sister’s.

I thought the same. Wikipedia says they are childhood friends but if this is mentioned in the movie it is brief

>Why would the doctor not tell her she was pregnant?

The doctor did try to. Before she could, Cecilia noticed the pill bottle on the sink and stopped listening.

>How did Adrian fake his death and not be charg

The story is that his brother faked Adrian's death and kept him prisoner.

>How did he even create the suits without his people knowing?

His lab looked like multiple people worked there. I assume money is the answer. When you have billions of dollars, you can buy a lot of silence. It's not unusual for people who work in research to sign NDAs anyway.

I don't think it is shown that he is?

If you are talking about the ending, Cecilia uses his hands to lift the knife and cut his throat. The cops don't know there is more than one suit.

1. She had already displayed signs of being mentally unstable/vulnerable. She hadn't left the house for weeks, she fainted at work, and she thought her dead ex was still alive (I'm assuming her sister and her friend were in contact). She could have been more open to hearing her out, but the email was fairly scathing and she probably wasn't thinking straight. 
2.   I doubt they would bother checking the footage. A woman had her throat slit and the only person close enough to have done it was the MC, who acted delusional upon her arrest. Pretty open and shut case. Even if they did look at the footage it probably wasn't until later (by which point Adrien had already attacked).
3. That bothered me too. However it is possible that the suit is porous to allow for breathability (there are no obvious gaps to allow for it otherwise).  
4. The paint thing definitely bothered me. Checking the attic wouldn't have amounted to much. He might have found the knife, but he was already convinced the main character was crazy.
5. They probably did. We don't (unless I'm forgetting something) know how much time passed between his brother's death and the dinner. He could have easily lied and said that his brother made him fake his own death. Again, a fairly open and shut case.

2. we don't see how the knife ended up in her hand. as far as we know, he could've slid the knife to her from the table very slowly, and the camera could easily be out of sight of the table, or at the very least, it may not have been able to pick up how it moved, given he may have been doing so from the second they both were there and sat down. also, you said it yourself, that place is high class, i bet there were security and police already there to, y'know, be security.
3. we don't know the limitations of the suit. it's not explained and doesn't need to be because this isn't a capital-H Hard sci-fi movie.

I went into the movie not knowing anything about it, but the opening scene I assumed she was stealing something from him. How can she be a prisoner and know everything about the house's security? I assumed the rage was over her stealing from him, or her letting the dog run away. 

The Email being sent was also stupid. The entire way that scene was handled, and I actually called out that this is just setting up for some ""make-up scene"" where something terrible happens to the sister.

&#x200B;

I still don't get who the cop and daughter were to her...   


I will just cut to what made me rage about the movie. Cecilia breaks back into the house and steals the suit. She then stashes the suit in the closet. So a house full of cameras would have seen her run into the part of the house and leave without the suit--assuming that wasn't the brother in the suit.  


After the brother gets killed in the suit they find Adrian behind the wall.   


Adrian doesn't remove the suit from the hiding place once he is free.  


During the dinner, she snuck out of the washroom, went to the closet, got changed into a skintight suit and came back to kill him because he said ""Surprise"".  


She then manages to leave, out of the camera's view, and get changed back into her normal close. Fix her hair and do her makeup before coming back out to put on a act. She pretty much just teleports around the house.  


In the end, my conclusion was. Adrian was a piece of shit, and Cecilia was also a piece of shit. There is no proof of anything she says outside of the window punch (which would be super impressive if you could actually punch through a window)",fafwsf

Why do they need to show him punching her for you to think he was abusive? 

I don't think this movie is or ever was meant to be a movie where anyone comes away wondering if he did it. This was a very spoon feed the audience kind of movie.

You can't have your cake and eat it too by including a potentially ambiguous ending, but also have Adrian be clearly guilty throughout the film.

there's no question at all, the movie explicitly implies there are two suits. In the beginning we see her hide her bugout bag in the AC vent in the closet, this establishes Adrian didn't know about the hiding spot. Later, when she's at the cop's house and she has the fight with Adrian, then takes the Lyft back to his house, we can be certain she got there before him (if he came back at all, the dog's reaction implies he was there but we can't be sure) for a few logical reasons: Adrian couldn't have made it there quicker than her in the Lyft, and even if he somehow did, he would have to have gotten the suit perfectly clean and placed it back in its stand in the lab.

His brother died in the invisibility suit. This proves that a civilian is able to be completely invisible and undetectable. How was the CIA/NSA not all over that? How was Adrian not locked up? Even if he was not suspected of actually terrorizing her, he still hid ridiculously powerful technology that could easily be used for terrorism from the government.

although he knows its a powerful suit, he has no reason to believe his friend would abuse the suit's potential. he simply sees her removing evidence from the crime scene which could affect the interpretation of the camera feed. he also knows his friend better than he knows his colleagues and ""the system"": how long do you think a suit like that would remain in his station's evidence room?

I think the film is stronger for that, creating a sense of confliction in the viewer would have been the expected and very generic route to take.

Instead you’re clearly shown Adrian is invisible and it’s made clear in no uncertain terms that he’s an abuser.

Not sure where you got the ambiguity from, cause the film doesn’t convey it at all.",fafwsf

""Finally, and perhaps the most subtle nod of all. Whannell’s previous directorial effort Upgrade, if you haven’t seen it, absolutely freaking rips. It’s a muscly near future sci-fi-action-horror about a man out for revenge implanted with an A.I. that takes control of him and gives him freaky fighting powers. The Invisible Man has some broader references to Upgrade, including some of the “locked-off long-take” set pieces and fight choreography (i.e. Moss fainting in her job interview, the invisible man hospital fight) and the return of Benedict Hardie in a small role. But there’s something even bigger going on, with something even smaller.

The name of the tech company in Upgrade is Cobalt. And the name of Jackson-Cohen’s tech company… is Cobalt. Holy cannoli. Is The Invisible Man a stealth prequel to Upgrade? Is there an extended Whannell-verse of dystopian technological nightmares? Did Jackson-Cohen’s Invisible Man inject himself with the same A.I. as Upgrade?""",fafwsf

fofibu7,"I quite enjoyed it, but there are definitely plot holes. I'll try to respond to some:

>If Adrian was indeed kidnapped, how did he explain faking his own death to the police?

He would have blamed his brother for forcing him to do it. At the end, at the dinner table, he says ""Tom controlled me.""

>How is Adrian not making a sound when he walks around? Not one floor in any of the places makes a creak under the weight of a grown man?

Yeah, that's a problem. Also, how do people not bump into him? He can't always duck out of the way. Most of the people I know are visible, and I bump into them from time to time.

>Why did she feel the need to take the knife out of the plastic bag. Better yet, why did Adrian even put it in there?

I think because it had her prints on it, and he could use it to frame her. Putting the knife in her hand was a better idea, though.

>How the hell did Adrian manage to wash off paint from a suit made of thousands of camera using a kitchen sink? Quickly as well.

I don't think he necessarily washed it all off. Just enough so he could see. Then he moved away from the sink when he realised Cecilia was coming.

>Were there no cameras in the restaurant showing a floating knife killing the sister?

Gigantic plot hole. I also think at least one other person would have seen the floating knife.

>Where'd he get the huge knife? 

Smuggled it in his suit? 

>How'd he get the knife in her hand so fast? Any why did she close her fingers around it and continue to hold it?

He's invisible. And he closed her fingers around the knife.

>Why did she think telling cops Adrian was invisible would go anywhere? Is she truly an idiot?

No, but she'd just seen her sister killed right in front of her. I think we're supposed to allow that she was genuinely not in full control of her mental faculties at that point. 

>Adrian had no idea of the obvious hiding spot in his own closet? He saw her bring it in and walk out without it. 

No he didn't. He thought *she* might be hiding in the closet, but he didn't realise she'd taken the suit or hidden it there.

>Were there no cameras in the mental hospital? I think not. Why did the security guard aim his gun at Cecilia when she was down the hall when he saw his partner get beat up? Several eye witnesses and she's still under investigation?

Yes, but they hardly had time to review the footage and interview witnesses. This all happened in a matter of about 2 minutes. The security guard was the fifth person to enter the corridor, and whether he had seen half-materialised Adrian or not, he wasn't totally sure what or whom the threat was, so he told Cecilia to lay down, and when she said someone was behind him he appeared to believe her. Everybody else is dead or unconscious, so nobody has an opportunity to explain.

>Why does rain not make the suit easier to see? He's a physical object which means droplets will bounce off and show his silhouette. Nope. I guess rain is phasing through him.

I think it would, and that's why they showed Cecilia looking at the weather report earlier. But at some point in the carpark ecilia realises that the reason she can't see him is that he's probably hiding under cards, which is why she crouches down to look. The she encounters him sheltering under the open trunk of a car. So basically he worked out he'd be visible in the rain, and worked around it.

>Why isn't the CIA investigating Adrian after they have proof of an invisibility suit? All the proof from the scenario I described previously. Even a broken suit shows advanced technology that requires investigation.

We don't know that they're not. But they have the dead body of his brother who was wearing the suit when he broke into the home of a police officer and tried to kill everyone, so a good lawyer would have little trouble explaining that Tom controlled Adrian, and either stole or forced him to create the suit. 

>Why does Cecilia think walking away and leaving Adrian's body will help her look and less suspicious? Idiot needs to stay with Adrian crying until the ambulance arrives.

She could quite easily look like she was running to meet the ambulance and show them where Adrian was, or tell the authorities she was running to get James.",fafwsf
fo8xhn6,"You can like a movie without being able to explain its plot holes, but that's what makes it enjoyable. There's so much mystery, so many things unexplained. That could be a bad thing, but it can also be a good thing. It leaves the audience wondering and asking questions. Sure, the plot holes are illogical and make no sense at all,, but it's a movie!

Now, as for the plot holes you brought up, I agree, they make very little to no sense, but that's doesn't make me automatically dislike the movie. I still thoroughly enjoyed it despite the plot holes.

&#x200B;

>**""If Adrian was indeed kidnapped, how did he explain faking his own death to the police?""**

Who said he was indeed kidnapped, though? That could easily be the conclusion the audience would come to, since that's what the movie indicates to us by showing Tom as the invisible man and Adrian tied up in his own basement, but it can be easily said that Adrian faked the kidnapping with the help of his brother. The brothers wanted to trick everyone into thinking Adrian was the victim, for whatever reason that may be. Possibly to make Ceclila go crazy, as stated by her in the movie.

&#x200B;

>**""How is Adrian not making a sound when he walks around? Not one floor in any of the places makes a creak under the weight of a grown man?""**

That's a good point. I would also like to add; how did his suit never make a single sound throughout the movie up until the hospital attack? His suit makes this weird alien-like predator sound. In moments of silence where being silent is essential, his suit is quiet. But in moments where there is a fight going on, his suit starts making those predator sounds. How come? Unless it's some sort of feature of the suit, which he can turn on/off.

Also, if he's in a suit, why did exhaling through his mouth create fog when he was standing right behind Cecilia? I'm also surprised that Cecilia never managed to to bump into him on accident at all during the movie despite him being right next to her at several moments.

&#x200B;

>**""Why does rain not make the suit easier to see? He's a physical object which means droplets will bounce off and show his silhouette. Nope. I guess rain is phasing through him.""**

It did make his suit easier to see. Watch the scene again. You can see his silhouette in the car park as he threatens Cecilia, shoots the cop, and makes his escape via the door. The rain is landing on him as well as dropping off of him, exposing the outline of his suit.

Another mystery I'd like to add and expand upon. Could it be that both Tom and Adrian were present at Adam's house after the hospital attack? When Sydney pepper sprays who we then discover to be Tom, he falls to the corner of the room next to the wardrobe. Then when Sydney quickly sprints across the hallway, she gets close-lined from the front. How? It was almost like he somehow teleported. But then you would ask yourself, why was there a need for both of them to be at the house? And if Adrian was also present at the house, how did he have enough time to fake his own kidnapping by locking himself up in the basement, which I'm sure would have required another person? On top of that, how many suits are there? Cecilia stole one and hid it in the closet, which she would then use against Adrian at the end of the movie, Adrian is wearing one, and then Tom has one when he attacks Sydney. So that's 3 suits. However, some have speculated that Adrian actually switched suits with Tom in the car park. Notice the open trunk of the SUV just before Adrian/Tom holds Cecilia by the throat and threatens her? But wouldn't it be convenient that the damaged suit Adrian gave to Tom stops malfunctioning when he gets to Adam's house, where full and permanent invisibility is essential? Because of this, I suspect that Tom used another suit.",fafwsf
fp8xhsi,"I have many of the same questions... Especially the one about Adrian faking his death to the police and then showing up as a kidnapping victim. 

I do recall though, to answer one of your questions, that Adrian did become more visible in the rain. You can see his silhouette in the water that is dripping off the suit. And in the shots you couldn't see him, he was hiding underneath the open trunk door of the minivan  so as to avoid being seen in the rain.",fafwsf

Question 3: Also possible he's just stealthy. Also wouldn't be farfetched to assume he equipped the sole of his invisibility suit with sound dampeners or something cuz making noise kinda negates your reasons for being invisible.

Question 9: She's not gonna just keep quiet and watch them accuse her of murdering her sister. Plus, the movie wants to sell the act of her ""going crazy"", so yeah..

ftc77gf,"there's no question at all, the movie explicitly implies there are two suits. In the beginning we see her hide her bugout bag in the AC vent in the closet, this establishes Adrian didn't know about the hiding spot. Later, when she's at the cop's house and she has the fight with Adrian, then takes the Lyft back to his house, we can be certain she got there before him (if he came back at all, the dog's reaction implies he was there but we can't be sure) for a few logical reasons: Adrian couldn't have made it there quicker than her in the Lyft, and even if he somehow did, he would have to have gotten the suit perfectly clean and placed it back in its stand in the lab. Thus we know the suit she found in the lab on the stand was a second suit, and we know Adrian didn't know she hid it because it's established that he doesn't know about her hiding spot in the AC vent. 

I agree that the cuts were a little quick between her killing him in the suit and her coming back out in the black dress, but that's a pretty minor hiccup.",fafwsf

fkhmw45,"I disagree that the film was shot with Tom as the main culprit all along. It had to be Adrian. Nothing else makes thematic sense or has the same impact. It would have been a wishy-washy, unsatisfying twist if Tom as the Invisible Man were the final one.

I agree wholeheartedly, though, with the biggest rabbit-hole of the movie.

First of all, how would Tom be able to get Cecelia off of her murder charge and explain Adrian's ""resurrection"" if Cecelia agreed to his initial offer to make ""everything go away""? Regardless, she says no. Adrian's intimidation plan does not work.

So plan two: Adrian's Invisible Man stunt has failed. He has to win Cecelia back himself. How? Somehow he has a chance to convince and send his brother to James' house to kill James' daughter. No way Cecelia would go back to Adrian after that, especially since she has few close people left for Adrian to kill. But Adrian knows this; that's why he has Tom do the dirty work and pretends that Tom kidnapped him.  Now Adrian can be absolved of all wrongdoing and even appear sympathetic. But there is no way, even if Tom were donning the suit for the first time, for Adrian to assume Tom would die, which is necessary for the fake-kidnapping scenario to work (otherwise, feeling betrayed, Tom would deny it).

Assuming Tom would succeed in his mission to kill James' daughter, then what? Cecelia would assume it was Adrian, and, as stated above, would never go back to him after that.

Since the kill-James'-daughter scene immediately shifts to the police closing in on Adrian's house, how did Adrian know that Tom did get killed? Because binding himself up wouldn't work if Tom were alive to explain the truth. And why expect the cops to even come there? Who or what were they looking for with guns wielded the way they were?

The twists and turns felt cool at first viewing, but when I confirmed my lingering doubts about the movie's logic via a second screening, I was disappointed. It made the movie good for me, not great anymore.",fafwsf

2. I think that was a statement on how women aren’t believed. 

3. Just movie magic. 

4. James left her at the house alone, he wasn’t there and by the time she found the phone, Adrian was already beating her up so she had to get out. 

5. Yep, Adrian right up til the end. Remember he was faking his death so he’d need to stay out of sight. 

6. She was being chased by Adrian wearing another suit at the time. When she finds the suit, her dog barks shortly after, alerting her to Adrian’s presence in the house. She was thinking about how to hide the suit and how to get out of the house. 

7. James isn’t playing dumb, he’s doing what a LOT of people do and looking to blame the more obvious scapegoat (Tom) so the problem of Celia facing jail time goes away. She doesn’t want to pin all the abuse on Tom because it wasn’t him before the invisible suit. James thinks she should blame it on him because he’s the more obvious abuser now. That’s precisely why Adrian staged the “kidnapped behind the wall” thing so he would look sympathetic. 

8. I mean, it’s possible their voices just sound similar, being brothers. And yes it’s Adrian in her home, he follows her once she gets in the Uber. 

9. Well it’d be pretty dumb to invent an invisible suit then be clumsy while in it. Plus most people wouldn’t believe it/would excuse it away.

fse2fgz,"Those aren't really gaps in logic though. People try way too hard to pick apart movies these days.

-There was more than one suit.

-brother was being manipulated just like Cee was. 

-either adrian had visual access to the suit remotely, which could make sense, and saw his brothers death or he heard about the death before the raid....he then tied himself up when he saw them coming. (The former is my imagination at work, ha)

-they raided the house because of the very high tech suit (answers) and Cee telling them there was more going on. I'm sure the detectives figured it was worth it either way to gain further evidence.

-Not really, if they thought he wanted to keep his brother, the inventor, alive for whatever reason. Who knows why people do what they do <--this is a common take on such scenarios after the case seems to have been solved. If it looks solved and closed than they will probably close it unless there is substantial reason not too; one person's word is not enough reason to probe further for most people. Once adrian was found they just assumed what he wanted them to assume, that the brother did everything...case closed. 

-adrian likely followed the sister or Cee to restaurant. Who knows? Dude is a tech genius. There are a million ways he could have known. Was she using the same phone from when she was with him? GPS, tapped etc.
Did he have access to her uber payment/acct? User history. And so on...these may seem far out but for a tech genius it wouldn't. He obviously gained access to her email.

I believe the whole Tom kidnapping Adrian thing is a lie. I believe they were working together. Tom stated that he was in Cecilia's shoes when he was growing up with Adrian. So, considering that Adrian is good at studying people and figuring them out (as stated by Tom) I believe that Adrian planned this whole thing out even knowing that his brother would get killed so that he can reset his relationship with Cecilia and get her to stay with him.

If it's in her backpack, it's because she takes it with her when she leaves the house. And she is sometimes home alone at night, as she was at the end of the film.

>and how the hell did that knife even get in the bar? 

No idea, but it's not terribly implausible. Maybe he made an invisible knife-sheath?

>And right at the end, when the police would know of the existence of the suit, wouldn’t they question how a man calmly sitting a second ago would just slit his throat?

They knew of the existence of *one* suit; Elizabeth was the only one who knew there was a second. And if they looked at the footage, they would have seen a man apparently trying to win back his wife; she cries, he pleads with her, she goes to the bathroom, and he sits at the table in a thoughtful pose and then cuts his own throat. They would naturally assume that she had refused to reconcile and he couldn't handle it.",fafwsf

I thought the visuals around the fight scenes, and the suit were really great. 

But if they just stepped it back a touch to fill in the plot holes and illogical behaviour, it would have been such a great movie. 

Like the absolute ignoring of sound and footsteps in this world. The convenient use of physical space (there were so many times where someone would have needed to bump into Adrian, or have heard him move as he stepped out of the way in a hallway, or in the tiny room in the hospital. 

The hallway gun scene which was mentioned in this thread - like what is Cecilia doing during all of that!?

No no no none of this makes sense. Tom mustve been the invisible man the entire time as the mental institution.

So we see visible objects because light bounces off then into our eye.

Because she sees her sister is going through a mental breakdown and can see she's unstable at the moment.

She didn't catch the knife, it was forcefully placed into her hands by Adrian. Same as when Adrian ""suicides"".

I wasn’t sure if everyone was going to end up dead so nobody would know and therefore we wouldn’t for sure.

I had a bit of a problem with the hallway right in the hospital for this reason. There must be cameras so I felt at that point it had to be real (also the guards were only knocked out) - also it’s unlikely she would be able to overpower so many guards - so it had to be real.

I would have preferred it to be ambiguous.

fj7vol7,"Hi. I’m a huge fan of the Universal Horror movies. I’m also a huge fan of the original movie. 
I would highly recommend this movie. Universal has tried a lot of remakes of classic horror movies (*cough*theMummy*cough*) and they’ve always fallen a bit short, and are almost never really scary (in my opinion) no matter how much fun they may be. 
This is an exception. As a fan of Universal Monsters, I was almost shedding tears of joy. They FINALLY brought one of their classic monsters into the modern world while being respectful to the original and having a few nods to the original as well. 
I will say that the story deviates a bit from the original, but this also takes place now, so it’s more relevant. But I feel like there’s a lot that’s true to the source. The Invisible Man’s name is Adrian Griffin. I was happy that they kept Griffin as his name. 
Also, the character is more in line with the character in the novel. He’s less sympathetic. He’s a psychopathic genius in the field of optics.

And maybe I missed something but somewhere throughout the middle of the film, the power dynamic just switches from Adrian having all the power, to Cecilia hunting him down. How can there be such a huge change so sudden.

Mental hospital should have cameras that caught the invisible demon man but apparently nobody cares. 

When Adrian gets hit with paint, how does it just all drip off him in a few steps. And it was shown that the paint hit his head. Did he wash his head and his torso with the tap??

It was a good movie but there were parts that was just so stupid",fafwsf
fj4ye8m,"Here's a few more:  


* How exactly is the suit ""designed?""  I'll buy that the suit works; that's the scifi part of it.  However, this is a very intricate and expensive piece of electronic genius.  It should be at least waterproof, which is suggested by the paint scene, and him being able to prance around in the rain with no problems.  However, he is somehow able to breathe out and get his breath to steam up in the cold air.  That scene made me think he wasn't in a suit but his whole body was just invisible.  Secondly, since it must be waterproof, why did pepper spray even affect the wearer in the first place?  I would've bought that the pepper spray only marked him revealing the suit to the little girl, but no.
* How does Adrian know exactly where the main character is going at all times?  I can buy maybe once or twice as stalking/lucky guesses, but seriously, 100% accuracy all the time is too much.
* Cecilia stabbed the dude many, many times right?  So there should be evidence of that on the suit right?  I get that it starts malfunctioning a little bit, but there should be physical and bloody holes in the damn thing.
* How does Cecilia know how to operate the suit?  It's sophisticated technology, and the one time we see any semblance of operating the suit was when she pressed the wall mounted control panel to turn the suit off, implying that she would at least need to use that panel again to activate the suit.  We are expected to believe that she went to fetch the hidden suit, bring it down to the lab, figure out how to put it on and activate it, walk back to the dining room, slit Adrian's throat, run back to the lab, deactivate it, and walk back to the dining room, all while dodging the other security cameras in the house, and all before Adrian managed to bleed out from a gaping wound?
* That said, wouldn't Adrian notice that one suit was missing?  You don't just misplace a multi million dollar piece of technology and brush it off.
* And finally, the mother of all plot holes, the ward scene:  Cecilia is fighting Adrian, and has at this point stabbed him multiple times.  Adrenaline is coursing through her body and she has at this point fully committed to fight and not flight.  She gets knocked down in the hallway by Adrian, and is surrounded by several guns all within reach.  Why then does she make like a starfish and lay there for the 2 whole minutes Adrian goes on a John Wick style action montage disarming and beating on a platoon of security guards?  She had any number of chances to grab a gun and shoot him down right there.  He wasn't even fully invisible all the time.  And yet, she conveniently waits UNTIL he prances out the doorway to finally grab a gun and lightly jog after him.
* Bonus plot hole: It didn't look like he even killed all the guards; he mainly just bashed some heads against the wall, which, considering the beating the black police officer took while ending up fully recovering, had to be non lethal.  Adrian wasn't portrayed to being merciful to any degree, so why leave all those loose ends there anyway?",fafwsf

fj9vrms,"So I saw the movie last night but after having some time to sit on it, I agree that there's a lot of plot holes, or atleast things that made me go ""wait what?"". The one I'm really fucking confused about is how Elizabeth Moss got the suit. We saw her stash it in Adrian's bedroom closet. Did he not see her put it in there? This surveillance Mastermind doesn't know there's a stash spot in his own closet that she's been using? So then okay, let's say he doesn't know its there and he also doesn't know that one of his fucking invisibility suits is missing. So Elizabeth Moss goes to the bathroom near the dining area, which is near the front door. We saw earlier that the bedroom is near the back of the house on the cliffside. So, Elizabeth Moss had to go all the way back there to get the suit, all the while not raising any of Adrian's fucking alarms in his own head? It's not like the suit is the next room over, it would have taken her a big chunk of time to get there. 

Does Adrian not once ask himself why she's taking so long in the bathroom? Does he not once think to pull out his phone and check his own cameras to see if she left the bathroom? The guys a mad scientist narcissist, did he not once think that she might be planning something? Then, the suit is 3000 million cameras on it, and is made of rubber or whatever so that it's form fitting. That's not like putting on a tee shirt which takes 30 seconds. This is a full body gimp suit with cameras on it! And isn't the suit custom made for Adrian and or maybe his brother? Who are both taller and bigger than she is? HOW DOES IT FIT PERFECTLY ON HER BODY. It just doesn't make any sense!! So then she has to silent step ALL THE WAY BACK to the front of the house, kill Adrian, go back to the bathroom, take the suit off, and then come back to call 911? Like how long did this exhange take, 3 hours? It happened way too fast to make sense, she fit in the suit perfectly, and the most manipulative man on the planet who has a house full of cameras he can check didn't think that Elizabeth Moss might cross him. I'm just so confused.

How did she even know how to operate it? We only saw her turn it off in the lab via some base station. Just ugh. It's still a really good movie but a physical suit, especially one that elaborate raised so many questions and created a lot of plot holes.",fafwsf
fj0bku5,"The movie had plenty of plot holes, but the punch? But what was she gonna say? An invisible man punched her as the only logical conclusion which she came to 0.5 seconds away? A ghost perhaps? She was alone with her, looked down for a couple seconds and got gobsmacked. Like...it’s the only thing she could make sense of in that split second. I can see that. And if you’re an outsider and come to the scene a second later, what will you believe? That the invisible man punched your daughter to pass the blame to the woman who you believe is going through some level of psychosis?

Also, before the house was raided, it’s easy to believe he could’ve taken care of some evidence. It is his house after all, and there was two of them.

Like you said, he’s rich and powerful. Rich and powerful people can change everything to have a single person step in as power of attorney. Like that’s totally plausible, and the research easily could have been private/personal. All we knew as viewers was that he had a bunch of computers in his basement.

I don’t recall anything suggesting he had super speed. I thought it was safe to assume his brother was working with him. Also, being weak and killed off the bat would’ve made for a weak thriller :/ it’s a common trope, but almost every villain in a thriller/horror possesses some kind of super ability to live and fight and stalk.

Sneaking around quietly isn’t hard to do, especially if you’re not wearing boots or heels. You literally just have to be aware of your surrounding.

But a lot of it did come down to illogical fallacies. I kept thinking “why isn’t she asking for [autopsy report]?” And she didn’t stick around the hospital long enough to have the cameras checked.",fafwsf

fj0bok0,"Almost always, whenever one nit-picks a film, it's because they don't understand an essential aspect of great filmmaking: economy of plot writing.

Said economy is about focusing on the essence of the plot.  The context behind the plot is stripped to its barebones, just enough to explain—the skeletonizing leaves just enough plausibility to give the audience enough reason to *give the plot the benefit of the doubt*.

A common and fundamental example is how science fiction films typically rely on the audience to understand economy of plot writing so the audience can accept the fictional science instead of dwelling on nit-picks.

Economy of plot writing is one way to evaluate the technical prowess of the screenwriters and director.  They need to draw a thin line between what's too little and what's too much.  The sweet spot is just enough and affords the filmmakers to focus more on what matters.

Lack of info required audience to fill in a lot of gaps, sometimes not very plausibly.

She's almost Reek (Game of Thrones) level timid, shy abuse victim 100% of the time, with zero apparent interests, desires or ambitions which I eventually found very dry and honestly hard to care about her even despite all the bad stuff happening.

Never laughs, never flirts, every social interaction serves no purpose other than reinforcing that she's shy/abused. I get it's a suspense/thriller but these things should be peppered in.

Compare to Paranormal Activity which this clearly movie got a lot of it's inspiration from.

fm73uta,[deleted],fafwsf
flpmblm,I think it was his brother who let the cops alive,fafwsf
fm001mz,"First plot hole: the guy is super rich and brilliant. He could easily have a very fast car or motorcycle, hell, even a helicopter, stashed away somewhere near the house to make it back to his home quicker than she can in an uber. I mean, the guy can make himself invisible, it's not too much of a stretch to believe that he can track her and beat her back to his house.

Second plot hole: Maybe the suit makes him stronger? And by that token, it makes her stronger as well when she wears it? I agree, realistically, a good amount of the people who are attacked should be able to fight back and even overpower him. A good amount of fighting relies on tactile sense and not on visual information. Once someone is grappling you at a close range you would be able to detect where their limbs, torso, etc., are. However, it's essentially a monster movie, and he's the monster.

Third: Yea, that one seems like it wasn't terribly well explained in the film. I just saw the film and I didn't realize she had access to the suit. I guess it's because she stashed it away earlier, but you think he would have find it lying around. And yea, I don't know how she would know how to operate it so easily.

Fourth: Same as above. His function in the narrative is as a monster. An unseen menace with powers we're not fully able to define. They aren't really plot holes because he's consistently undetectable throughout. (Note: I'm using this definition of plot hole -- ""an inconsistency in the narrative or character development of a book, film, television show, etc."") Therefore, we can also assume the suit somehow compensates for these aspects of stealth as well.

Fifth: He was planning to pin it on his brother all along, so by that point he wasn't worrying about the invisibility suit being revealed. And yes, of course it's extreme! That's the whole conceit of the movie. If you think it's over-the-top, well, no wonder you didn't like it. You didn't buy the basic premise. That's fine... but, again, I think you're trying to see  Adrian as an actual person, and not as a movie monster, which is more what his function is, cinematically speaking. We're talking someone who has become so demented by their need to control another person's life, they transform themselves into a lurking demon to torment their victim. Yes, that's clearly not a reflection of normal human psychology. It's cartoonishly evil. Take it or leave it, that's what the move is presenting.

Sixth: She was suffering extreme anxiety because of what was happening and the events all unfolded rather quickly from her first instance of suspecting him to be invisible. Even had she tried to do that, he probably would have prevented her from obtaining the equipment. 

To your final point: movies have absolutely no obligation to explain plot points. Plot is merely a convention. Movies don't even really need to have plots. They can be a string of sounds and images not necessarily cohered by a narrative. There's more than plot that makes movies engaging. Style, tone, imagery, symbolism. The visceral experience of it unfolding before your eyes in a way that defies what you've come to expect from normal reality. Obviously, this isn't an experimental non-narrative film, so it is fair to judge it on the basis of its narrative and the strength of its plotting. And in that regard, I think it did a damn good job. If it delved too deeply into the technical aspects of how the invisible man pulled it off, it would take the audience out of the story. It's not important how executes his scheme. What's intriguing is that she's being stalked by a force that neither she nor we fully comprehend.",fafwsf
fm2cx0u,"I don't know if this is a plot hole but another thing I noticed is that at the end when she kills Adrian and makes it look like a suicide, I'd imagine that the authorities would be much more suspicious since they now know that there are invisible suits around. 

Also, in the restaurant scene when the sister got killed, it looks cool I guess when you just see the knife floating and slice her throat and then it suddenly be put in Elisabeth Moss's hands, but I'm trying to visually imagine a human slicing someone's throat and then like forcing the knife into someone elses hands that fast.

> The restaurant scene: yes, it caught me off guard and was pretty damn scary. But does the restaurant have no cameras?

With how quick it happened and the quality of surveillance cameras (even the ones in Adrian's house, which I doubt the restaurant has), I don't think footage would prove anything. Especially if they're not trying to prove her innocence. 

>  And what was with them going to some high-end considering the situation? Doesn't that seem like an appropriate time for Chili's or something?

If anything I thought a popular/visible restaurant would have been the better choice.

> When Moss' character goes to the house and discovers the suit: why didn't she put on the suit and walk out? Or at the very least take pictures of it, she had her phone didn't she? It seemed like the only reason she left it there was so the movie could have the ending it did.

My understanding is that she was planning on actually taking the suit with her, but then heard Adrian in the house so she had to hide it. 

> The attic scene: she poured paint on his suit, didn't she? HOW DID HE WASH IT OFF THAT QUICKLY AND SO EFFICIENTLY?

It's a future-tech invisibility suit covered in cameras. I just assumed the material had properties that prevented things from sticking to it, like waterproof clothing.

> The hallway fight with the cops: She had so much time to pick up the gun and shoot him, why didn't she?

I suppose one could believe that Tom did it all along, that *he* was the one who raped Cecilia and was framing Adrian but it seems heavily unlikely considering Adrian used to heavily abuse Cecilia and we can see this on her body when she first escapes.

Why was there focus on rain ? What do you mean ?

He was beating her up because he was an abusive lover, it's not like this kind of story never existed before, mothers dies from abusive husbands in the real world if you're not aware.

The motivations of his brother are something that are left blurry because it allows then to let the viewer doubt about Adrian's guilt. But the fact he used the same sentence as the invisibile man hints that he was using that suit. His brother and him, I do guess, were working together when you think about what Tom said to her when she was locked up about the money and the life they could have again. If Tom was alone on that, then I don't see why he would reveal he's still alive and that they could live together again if she agreed to.

Most of that happened before he knew she was pregnant, and also he was a psychopath.

The reason it seems Adrian got off scot-free is because his brother took the blame for being the Invisible Man. This was Cecilia’s suspicion all along. I don’t think the movie explained exactly why his brother was willingly attacking them on that one night, but perhaps Adrian was manipulating him as well, possibly by threatening *his* loved ones. The lawyer brother mentioned how controlling Adrian was, and during dinner, Adrian said the same about him (typical of a manipulative abuser)

As for leaving the scene, I’m not sure she did. We only saw her walk a ways and look out over what I assume to be the water. The cop would probably get in trouble for fleeing too so I’m assuming they both stayed and provided the story that he killed himself, which was supported by the dining room security camera.

She knows the house better than the paranoid control freak? Hmm.

One could also speculate that, from a psychological standpoint, a man of Adrian's genius and control-freak issues wouldn't be satisfied just having any random hot chick grovelling under his thumb.

fjxm2e1,"I really agree with these thoughts. Yes the parking lot scene was frustrating! Like Adrian was trying to escape, why did she think he would hang around in that exact parking lot and actually, why did he? She lost him for a bit and he actually should have left. 

The scene when Sydney was alone and the invisible man attacked her, I loved that she got him with the pepper spray, she really could have kept that going once she was running, but most of all, she just sat and screamed why her dad was getting beat up. Like presumably the invisible man was occupied, may have had his back to her. She could have sprayed or kicked or something. Yelling “stop” as someone who seems invincible in the moment and dangerous was frustrating. They could have showed her failing and missing punches when trying to get him off her dad, but just sitting and screaming doesn’t seem like what a cop’s daughter would do. 

ALSO, Cecilia has the perfect chance to stab Adrian the first time he grabbed her by the throat that first night. She had the knife in her hand the whole time she was choking her, probably with 2 hands. Again, it’s okay if she misses or he blocks the attempt, but at least show them trying to outsmart him. 

After the first time she threw paint on him to reveal him, it’s surprisingly she doesn’t employ that more. This happened early on, she could have kept spray paint or something around her secretly, take the mace option. Or I dunno, USE THE OTHER SUIT SHE HAD. I can’t believe she only used it at the end or didn’t take it as evidence at any point later. 

I also was hoping that Adrian would say something incriminating at the end, like mentioning a detail about what happened with her while he was “kidnapped,” like where she was living, something about her sister, paying for Sydneys college, the job interview. I wish Cecilia would have engage in conversation to let his guard down if the whole point was to get him to confess or kill him or something caused them to correlate the injuries he sustained in the fights before. The “surprise” part was satisfying but not enough. And how the hell did she just leave after calling the cops?! She on record as being there, leaving like that seems... like they forgot what this entails?

They made Adrian/brother seem omnipresent and very strong just because they’re invisible. He should not have been able to keep up with Cecilia when she went to his house in the Uber or getting into places without giving himself away. He is still human, has to move by foot, and getting somewhat injured through all of this, how can he just appear at long distances. We’re assuming here that he has used the suit before all this happened to get experienced, but still seems weird that no one bumped into him ever. Anytime he has his back turned and just watching Cecilia or planning, he’s taking up space where someone could have felt him.

That's just more witnesses and would make the idea of an invisible man more plausible. I might have missed it, but did they reveal that they caught the killings on camera (like of what happened in the hallway) and the invisible man realized it, so he just stopped giving a shit because he was outed either way?",fafwsf

fjycxig,I completely agree. Movie could’ve been absolutely stellar if it didn’t have some fatal flaw plot holes and some bad choices in critical moments,fafwsf
flmkp4r,"Your post is a mouthful, so I wouldn't bother addressing every point. Yes, the movie does have a lot of plot conveniences and some plot-holes (not all of these you mentioned are plot-holes), but despite it all, it still managed to carry a certain thrill, and that was the reason it's gotten praise. I love the movie myself.

1. The password thing was a deliberate decision by Adrian. The movie points to this when the main character sarcastically mentioned ""how romantic"", but apparently she isn't smart enough to put two and two together a realise that he'll be coming.
2. The prescription bottle isn't enough to convince anyone, and neither is it a plot-hole. Her sister did not see her drop the bottle; we, the audience, were shown that event. In that vein, even if his blood was on the bottle, it would've held no significance as proof of anything.
3. The main character wanted nothing to do with the antagonist, and that includes his money. It sounds irrational on paper, until you realise he still has some control over it, but I do not believe the main character was thinking about that. She just wanted to avoid anything related to the antagonist.
4. I don't disagree with you with that slap scene; it could've been done better, but who would believe there's an invisible person in the room? Despite not being close enough to do the deed, anyone will rationalise it to the closest thing that made sense, unless it's at a distance where it couldn't be ignored.
5. calling the police wouldn't have solved a thing, really. The guy is invisible, and no one is expecting an invisible person, especially one who apparently also has sound-dampening. It'd be easy for him to escape. The main character already knows that she wouldn't be physically incapacitated by him, so she did what any reckless main character does in these movies. The paint thing was utter bullshit though. Not necessarily because of how cleanly it got washed, but how quickly it was done without being noticed by the main character. We don't know what material the suit is made out of.  Even during the rain, it blended in perfectly with the environment.
6. As explained in one of my points, the antagonist deliberately allowed this to happen. His goal was never to kill her, only to terrorise her into submission.
7. The knife was never at any of the tables. It is unknown how he got it to its destination unnoticed. Again, how this was orchestrated was a failure in scene direction. It was all done using CG as well, as evidenced by the models and the inhuman and fluid movement. So yeah, I agree with you on this one.
8. I also agree with you on this too. The suit is damaged but it isn't fully dysfunctional.
9. not really willing to refute your point here, but I reckon getting hit by the material from the suit is going to hurt more than someone going barehanded. Size also isn't always something that determines who would win a fight.
10. to be fair, the movie was already long as it is. The contentious parts of this movie felt like some footage were on the cutting board to account for time. I had a few of these thoughts myself. I mostly just found it really weird that the cop would allow his friend to keep a suit such as that. What I want to know is how could she prove she didn't kill him if the police knows that an invisible suit exists? She will be prime suspect #1, and she will face scrutiny. The movie plays this out like the plan was a flawless one.

Plot-holes can be found in tons of movies, even highly praised ones, but sometimes the way a movie is directed is enough to forgive the weaker aspects of the film. If you're familiar with playing video-games, you'd understand a bit of what I mean. Similar to ""A Quiet Place"", ""Us"" and ""The Sixth Sense"", they all have holes, and A Quiet Place has a lot of contrivances, but their execution warranted a pardon for some people (and I don't even like The Sixth Sense).",fafwsf

2: Likely because they knew she was afraid for her life/safety and in a fragile state. It's why she was brought there in the first place. It was likely a comfort thing and the daughter seemed chill enough that I wouldn't be surprised if she suggested it    
3: Not a fan of this either because there isn't really a great answer but I wrote it off as his family/him being very wealthy and paying off higher-ups. A shit excuse but the only one I got.  
4: What movies have you seen that include bodily functions when it isnt relevant to the story? You don't watch Halloween and hear Michael's tummy grumbling while he silently lurks around (though it might be funny)  
5: Good question and I honestly kind of leave this up to lazy movie-making like the crime scene thing. We could say ""Oh, maybe shes crazy and imagined it all"" but that wouldn't explain other people being able to see Adrian+Tom in the invisibility suit  
6: ... This is a pretty good question. Either theres something I'm not getting or this is also just the result of poor writing/plot holes  
7: Eh, I assumed just because Cecilia had been acting so hectic and stressed and her sister is stressed so its just a shitshow of emotions and her sister maybe assumed she wrote it in a bad state but didn't necessarily *mean* it? Cecilia could say she was hacked but I don't think she thinks anyone believes much of what she says right now anyways.    
8: See answer 6.  
9: I was thinking this too. I was highly annoyed she didnt grab the taser. If she at least tased Adrian maybe it would fuck up the suit AND stun him at the same time, long enough for her to shoot him or bonk him on the head.  I get that shes panicked and this is a *really* fucking weird scenario to wrap ones' head around, though.   
10: Eh, maybe doing this kind of shit isn't his forte and wasn't thinking clearly since Adrian was making him do it.  Guy also did seem *kind of* dense.

Also I don't get why people think Adrian is not guilty. Adrians plans were based on knowing his wife characteristics well and sabotaging her. Tom wouldn't have a clue how to do this. Also it explains how Adrian sends an email from her account to her sister. Tom wouldn't have access to this.",fafwsf
fj2897h,"Adrian was The Invisible Man. 

His brother mentions Adrian had been abusing him in a similar way to Cecilia. Since they're brothers, one can surmise this abuse had been going on for most of their lives. So Adrian was able to manipulate him into helping him abuse other people, like Cecilia. His brother saw no method of escape and assumed carrying out Adrian's gross plans was a better way of living than the abuse that would come from not. 

There were two suits. The one Adrian and Tom used and the one Cecilia stashed in the safe and used to kill him. 

Killing Adrian makes sense. Either he dies, Cecilia dies, or she returns to the abusive relationship. The Invisible Man in this film isn't a monster that terrorizes the general populace. He has a specific target and someone needs to ""win"" for the ending to be satisfying. I really didn't see any ambiguity.

His tone and behaviour were a little all over to neither confirm or deny that he was part of the scheme. The use of the word surprise may also have been an illusion on Cecilia's part.

fl6yr6u,"Yeah, the natural first reaction to that would have been to ask, ""Is this real?"" and when she got a NO she argued that it was.  The email bore no resemblance to the way Cecilia was behaving before nor after the sister got it.  It was a wild outlier and people sending fake messages from either spoofed or hacked accounts (or a not-dead narcissist husband who knows your password) is a thing that everyone knows about.

The crazy thing is the rest of Wallfisch's score is stellar. The man knows how to work the orchestra, and is a real return to form from the Zimmer imposters we have been forced to deal with for the past 10 years or so. 

I kinda feel that was a compromise between Wallfisch and the producers. ""Guys, you know I am a symphonic composer, let me write like the oldies would.""

""Okay fine, but give us at least some electronic sprinkled somewhere.""

I thought back to the scene in which she finds the suit and has to pull pretty hard to get even the head off the dummy. Made me think of something like a thick divers suit. Meaning you don't just slip in and out of it. And that ruined it a bit, because it made me think further. Like, how did she know how to activate it? Does it just activate on its own once closed? If so, how did she know that? And why didn't Adrian wonder why one of his suits is missing? A manipulative control freak like him *surely* puts some kind of tracking into his revolutionary tech?

It's fine, really, loved the movie, but for me goes to show how easy it is to break immersion by a simple 'mistake' in your script.

Need to re-watch. Maybe there's a reasonably large time skip shown in the cameras feed pointed at the table or something.

My other complaint is the ending. Much like Hereditary (imo of course), it went on a bit too long. Should have cut at the 'Surprise', or maybe just a knowing look between Cee and the cop guy and her walking away wordlessly with Zeus. Show us she's carrying a bag she didn't have before and cut. No need for talk, no need to show the suit in the bag. Felt unnecessary at best and like sequel bait at worst.

as for adrian getting blood on himself, he was probably behind her but again, if you saw blood floating in the air you’d doubt yourself, or everyone would be too distracted by the murder that just happened to even notice.",fafwsf
fj321yz,"I personally see it like this: no one is looking around specifically looking for, nor expecting to see a physical floating knife. People would be glancing around briefly and mindlessly while in conversation, while others would think their eyes are playing tricks on them; OR, people see the whole thing unfold, but deny recounting what they saw simply because they don’t believe it themselves, after all, who would believe a witness saying they say a floating knife? 
  
It also happens quick enough, it’s not floating their forever.  
  
Witness memory recall is also scientifically proven to be horribly unreliable. I think this scene gets a pass, I totally could see something in plain site like this going unnoticed.",fafwsf

[Other Illustration](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e2/fd/b2/e2fdb2cb3b91366ded6088130770d2e0.jpg) 

The God of Surveillance popped into my head at once upon seeing the design, especially since the dog being named ""Zeus"" and having his name be the first written word we saw got me looking out for other references to those myths. I'm sure I missed more. 

Of course, I believe real suits of this nature exist and do have this design (covered in cameras), so it might just be coincidence. Still, it was the very first thing that popped into my head - there's even a saying - ""followed by the eyes of Argus"", meaning that you feel like you're being stalked, that your privacy is being invaded, and that the surveillance never goes away (only a few of Argus' eyes sleep at a time). Zeus arranged for the death of Argus, but the doberman didn't really help with that here.

hl0r0jd,"I just saw the movie and I must agree with you guys. The ending was very unsatisfying. There were so many problems with it - Adrien doesnt care he is missing a suit, suit actually fits Cecile, Cecile get in and out of suit and back with perfect hair and makeup in  under a minute, Adrien suddenly too stupid to realize what she was planning, Cecile says she goes to bathroom but instead goes to the closet. And I am sure there are more errors in the execution, but even if it was executed flawlessly, it would still be lame. A third suit user would be a really good ending. 

Even better ending would be if the existence of the invisible man would remain a secret and the movie would end with Cecile hospitalized. However the best ending for me would be if Cecile finally managed to lead the cops to that hidden suit in Adrien's closet just to find out its just some kind of neoprene suit, revealing that there never was any invisible man and it all happened in Cecile's head.",fafwsf

fj2rt2j,"I just don’t think the filmmaking rises to the level of great. Not that it’s bad. It’s well done. I especially like the style in the first 30 minutes or so. It’s just as it goes on, it becomes a little more generic. To me, a great thriller is something like a Hitchcock, The Conversation, Silence of the Lambs, or even a Fincher. This doesn’t get nearly interesting enough to rise to the level of great. It maybe starts that way (I love the constant use of negative space in the wide shots in the opening scenes) but it certainly doesn’t end that way. I especially thought the return of the camera moves from Upgrade was a poor decision. I don’t think it fits this film. 

As for things that don’t make sense, there’s a lot to go around. I don’t buy Storm Reid getting so upset and believing that Elisabeth Moss just randomly hit her like that (at least not in that exact scenario). I don’t buy her sister believing she sent that e-mail. I don’t buy Adrian somehow finding a way to lock himself up in his house after running away from the psych ward, even taking his brother into account (and it’s definitely him in that sequence). I’m also not sure I buy the brother’s motivations in the film. The idea of him not having a spine and being easily controlled by Adrian just doesn’t land for me, even when you can see the twist coming from a mile away. 

But again, I really don’t care that much about plot logic and I also don’t think these necessarily break the movie. I just think it weighs it down. All that said, I still like the movie and can see it becoming a cable TV classic for me. I’m just not voting to put it in the pantheon.",fafwsf

fpglj7d,"This!

I *hated* the movie; few times in my life I've hated myself for watching bad movies, really hate I thought it was a good idea to watch this piece of shit and yes both were a piece of shit too, as you said.

I'll be honest aand I might even be downvoted for this, but Moss' acting skills are so bad, she annoyed me the whole movie, might have been they didn't build up her character and I didn't truly feel attached to her misery, but really she did look stupid, her facial expresions and almost everything, thought I was watching a low-budget movie with $100 bucks actors.

The fact that she runs away I understand it, but hiding in her friend's house and wait so fucking long? AFAIK The cop was her sister's best friend, I mean her husband could easily tell the cops her wife wnt missing and start to look for her, sooner or later they would have known her sister picked her up (or at least see her car close to the house) and where she took her, cops would've found her and she of course would tell them she doesn't want to go back, ask for divorce of something and THEN, he could make her go crazy: *Hey, my husband is a psycho, but I some shit flying around the house, I see weird shit every night.*.., ok ma'am you're nuts you can't take care of your baby as soon as he's born you husband will take care of him. AND THAT'S IT. No horsing around with acting like he died and wait for months to see if he can find her. That's too much. Oh, yeah, lemme act like I died and expect to get her back, have my baby and live hiding for the rest of my life or have a facial surgery and start with a new name, that's too freakin much.

Oh, yes, he wanted her because she was weak and without self-esteem, nope, he's rich AF, as she said, he can have any girl he wants, he can of course find a *better looking* woman with the same low self-esteem, ffs.

About the suits, wtf, he never noticed a suit went missing? That's too much BS, sorry.

And of course, the ending, ""lemme go to him and try a cliché of him confessing everything"", yes, because someone who went on a murdering spree will tell to his wife everything, not suspicious at all that she wants him to ""explain it with details"", yeaah sure!

She just wanted him dead, I kind of understand but to pull up some shit like that, she did all that in what? 20 minutes? While the cop didn't care? I mean, he was listening everything, she might have take off the micro, but... let me see, you do go there adn expect a murderer confession but suddenly hear nothing at all for at least 20 minutes and don't grwo suspicious that something might be wrong? She might be dead you know? Hell no, everything seems fine. Then she bloody suit is there? So when cops raided they didn't check the house, just went directly to find him and left, or worst, he never saw the suit missing, let's say he did notice it was missing, he looks for it and finds it, and puts it back were she can find it again? Let's say he didn't find it... she then have the suit and still doesn't care about it? That's bullshit.",fafwsf

According to the writer/director and stars of the movie the whole point is the movie asks you to believe Cecilia without any hard evidence to point at that Adrian is as bad as Cecilia says he is. Thats why they chose to have Adrian locked away in the basement and not show him operating the suit. Its not generic ambiguity for ambiguity's sake.

fofivv3,"> Who said he was indeed kidnapped, though? That could easily be the conclusion the audience would come to, since that's what the movie indicates to us by showing Tom as the invisible man and Adrian tied up in his own basement, but it can be easily said that Adrian faked the kidnapping with the help of his brother. The brothers wanted to trick everyone into thinking Adrian was the victim, for whatever reason that may be. Possibly to make Ceclila go crazy, as stated by her in the movie.

Cecilia made it pretty clear that Adrian faked the kidnapping, and I think we're supposed to believe her.

It’s the most valuable item he owns, and the only backup suit that we know of (which he needs in case something happens to the primary suit), and it could be used as a weapon against him if it got in the wrong hands. 

He knows Cecilia was in the house, and that she was clever enough to get away from him in the first place. But he doesn’t bother to confirm that the most lethal weapon he has is still in his basement? It would have taken 1 minute to check and it’s in his own house. 

I do think it’s possible he was so consumed with Cecilia that he just didn’t think about it, but considering how intelligent, conniving and detail-oriented his character is proven to be, it seems like a stretch to me that he wouldn’t spend one minute confirming that the suit was still there.

And there's no way they could be that quiet in all scenarios - especially their footsteps.

I can accept an invisibility suit that strengthens the user and makes them quieter but they should have mentioned that I think. Otherwise it feels a bit odd.",fafwsf

Surely that would be proof that something really strange was going on - or immediately be enough proof that the lady was in need of serious mental help.

I mean, you have to remember that nobody in the film except Cecilia knows that there could be someone invisible in the room...

>I am also suspicious on whether Adrian was in fact guilty of it all.

Another poster on the thread pointed out, and I missed it when I watched but when Sydney maces the invisible man in her bedroom there's clearly a second one in the hallway. She gets clotheslined from the front, not grabbed from the back by the maced one.",fafwsf

fjxo3hl,"> B. What restaurants are you eating at where they have cameras everywhere? I eat out all the time and I've never noticed camera at any of my locals from casual to semi-nice. Although in the movie the restaurant did look fancy.

You may just not be looking. They're there whether you notice them or not.",fafwsf
fjndh4l,"Whose points are you trying to refute???? 

I said the camera in the restaurant thing didn't bother me and neither did the dog noticing him.

If you are going to debate me then at least pick the right points.",fafwsf
fjs8t4w,"The dog looks right at an invisble person several times, and besides, i said the dog thing didn't really bother me that much.

fjsc8xg,"James lets C live in his house and sleep in the same bed as his daughter. C gives his daughter 10 grand for school without a secind thought....He suddenly thinks she's a monster cabable of beating the shit out of his kid?

Her sister gets an email including the words ""i never want to see you again"" then C shows up like an hour later acting like she has no idea and asks to take her to lunch? At the very least you'd think C was hacked.

The daughter was punched on the right side of her face from someone in a standing position. C was half laying on the ground 5 feet away on the left side of the girl. Even if she looked away for a second simple spatial awareness would dictate it was impossible for C to deck her.

If i was in that exact same scenario, even as a teen, and i loved C as much as this girl clearly does, i would not think she suddenly punched me in the face for no good reason from an impossible angle. Especially when C has been claiming an invisible man is after her for weeks.

When i saw that scene, I expected the girl to take C's side actually, and was quite surprised when she started screaming for her dad and blaming C with no hesitation.

With that said, why is it so impossible to believe that Adrian was able to invent an invisibility suit and use it to stalk his gf?

He's a world-renown brilliant optical scientist with millions of dollars who is clearly incredibly abusive from the first scene where he punches through the sisters car window.

After the first 3 or so weird incidents happened i would believe he was guilty wholeheartedly, especially if i loved and trusted C enough to allow her to seek sanctuary in my house rent-free and share a bed with my kid.",fafwsf

fsaaemy,And who leaves a can of paint open in the attic. Shit woulda dried out.,fafwsf
fqpahaz,It's not even that it's absolutely shocking . It would be good if the writers didn't have concussions. Exhibit 1 The corridor scene consists of the villan shooting people with his back turned to the hero for like 4 minutes. All the while the hero has access to 3 loaded guns directly in front of her but does nothing but watch. There are so many examples like this but goddamn that was the point u literally sat up and had a rant.,fafwsf

He deserved a big tip.",fafwsf

This wasn't an attempt at writing a ""strong female character"". She was pissed off at her sister and didn't want to deal with an annoying waiter who clearly doesn't care about them either. Pretty simple.

I also thought she was *oddly* rude but it's such a minor thing that's not worth getting bent over.",fafwsf

fl3duen,"Good point about the shock and possible repercussions of shooting at invisible targets. I guess, knowing that, I might have been more frustrated by the homogeneous nature of their responses than anything else. Maybe the scene could've benefited from variation in that regard, where one or two of them didn't freeze up and acted more aggressively, or evasively (or differently in some way), even if it didn't necessarily involve firing a gun. Just so it didn't feel like it was just checking off casualty boxes. I wasn't expecting Cecilia to really fight back, since she was unarmed for the most part, and probably unable to overpower Adrian unless she had a strategic advantage (like at the end).

fncl2gx,"It would make sense for him to have a car somewhere close to the house. It kinda only makes sense that he was tailing them the whole time but honestly the whole movie was full of unlikely shit happening to drive the plot.

Her sisters reaction to the email was another thing that felt very off. Especially when Cecilia came to the house looking very distraught and clearly didnt recognize writing that email. She was a good sister but yet was still super ready to shut off her sister who was having a super hard time?",fafwsf
fnmm0iw,"Way too risky. That code breaking scene was Adrian's downfall.

Also, it seemed like he never knew that she broke the code. If she closed the door after she left then he never knows the suit is gone unless he gets an alert to his phone r sum shit.

If he had known she had taken the suit, then surely he would have looked for it inside the house since he saw that she didnt leave with it. Also, he would have known she had no time to hide it except in that closet.. And it would have been crazy of him to invite her over to the house if he knew there was a missing invis suit in it that only she knew where to find. He was 0% worried about letting her walk freely alone in the house.",fafwsf
foltg6k,"Think about it.  
Say he's standing between a bulb and a wall, while facing the bulb.  
For there to be no shadow of him on that wall, he would need to produce the exact amount of illumination and in the exact same direction as the bulb.  This means that his back is now super bright.   
Anyone who looks at him from the side will notice that.",fafwsf

fn6i0w1,"And for sure if this was just one kind of convenience with the suit then okay. But to me it seems like over and over it is convenient how he stays hidden.

Like the paint washing off of him so fast. Why not just have him run away for the night.",fafwsf
fny2l4y,"Exactly. I think the movie was to long and they put him into to many implausible situations for logical people to enjoy.

If it was just him at the house, then maybe out in the park somewhere then it is a scary movie. However it makes you just question how everything is working the whole movie.",fafwsf
fmygepy,"Take for example the scene inside her cell (or what ever it was) right before she stabs him. Where is he in that scene? The guy checks everywhere and he is just jumping around him? That room is to small for him to be there and not be noticed. 

The scene where he pulls the blanket off. The cop guy comes straight into the room. He would have ran into him. 

Paid the cops off? Okay so then why do they come looking for him after his brother ends up dead in his suit? All of a sudden they are going to investigate this murder? I thought they were paid off not to?",fafwsf
fj6dth0,I caught that. Did he also tamper with the bloodwork? Or did the doc actually forget to tell her?,fafwsf
fj8jn3j,"Oh, she hinted towards the rape at the beginning?  

I thought the implication was that Adrian switched the birth control pills with the Diazepam, which knocked Cecillia out.  Then Adrian raped her while she was out cold.  That shocked expression that Cecillia had when she found out she was pregnant, it came across like she realized at that moment that she was secretly raped.",fafwsf

fjognvs,"Honestly, the worst part for me was when they cut from a silent scene to a super loud shot of her cooking eggs. Made me jump so hard just from the suspense of the previous scene.",fafwsf
fk81i15,"1. She could have worn the suit out of the house and proven her case.

Just because he's invisible doesn't mean he could see her in the suit or that he has enough strength to lift her with one arm.

2. Security cameras would have proven her case in the mental institution and restaurant so many times over.

3. If Adrian had his brother barracade himself in his place with enough force that cops had to break down the wall there's no way he could have been at the mental institution and gotten from there to his house in the time it took for her to drive from the mental institution to the house to save homeboys daughter.

It wasn't the brother at the institution because you heard Adrian's voice talk to her in the rain and she would know the difference.

4. With that also said, if the two brothers were really two places at once then the daughter and homeboy would have been long dead before she ever got close to the house.

In spite of all this, I actually really like the movie and found the best form of tension and the fear in something so inexplicably crazy happening and your closest friends and even your family not being able to believe you.",fafwsf

I loved the ending - the girl's redemption.  The moment she needs her cop friend after Adrian died.  She was in complete control - looking at him in the eyes ""look at me, I'm okay.  Adrian killed himself"".

She ended up acquiring that 'calm strong' nature she envied about her dead sister.",fafwsf
fwyxgti,Have to agree here. The whole scene with her tossing the sheet over the chair was the exact same thing.,fafwsf

fj2alzl,"You'd go ""what the fuck was that"", look around, and then maybe ask the other person if it was them. (""... Did you just hit me?"") I watched this scene twice, the daughter did not have her back to Moss. She was positioned so that she would've seen Moss moving close to or away from her before/after the attack, enough to be sure that it was her.

Unless Moss was The Flash. Is... she?",fafwsf
fl9ublj,"Yes! I meant to mention that as well. There is the point where that last guard comes in and he shoots him in the knee and then takes a few moments to toy with the guard, point the gun at his head and say ""bang.""

fj5knu2,"I think you might be confused, but my comment was indeed worded weird so I edited it. The movie sets up that the brother WASNT the ONLY bad guy all along. Only for a few seconds after the face reveal is that believed. That’s what I’m saying. 

-The version that I spell out on in my comment is not what the movie portrays in the end, but rather the ending I wish would’ve happened or think it was originally going for.

The ending we actually got leads us to believe that Adrian did indeed do all of this with the help of his brother based off of his known and constantly restated controlling personality. Also, the major use of “surprise” he says to her at the end. 

I am saying I think it was a nice twist that the brother was the bad guy all along, as I believed he was, until the following scene showing Adrian was still alive.",fafwsf

I can't remember ...didn't it glitch out at James house?",fafwsf
fj6emaf,"Exactly, there must be third suit.  


It's quite possible since Tom was so under the thumb of Adrian, he was waiting to go in killing Sydney, if Adrian assumed Cecillia would initially, or even possible refuse, he could have been ready to threaten to kill Sydney since he had already killed her sister.",fafwsf

He then leaves and she is escorted back to her cell.  Tom would have to leave the building, go to a car and change into the suit, then sneak back into the hospital, past locked doors, and into her cell. That's a stretch. 

If they were switching duties, and had two suits, they would each have their own suit because why would you not use both suits for two people? That's just stupid to have two suits but only use one between two people.",fafwsf

Well said, this is a pretty good concise review imo.

In general what people think of movies are determined by their expectations before watching it (obviously), which is probably why we're seeing such a wide range of opinions on the film in this thread at least. In most films, I try my best to temper expectations regardless of hype around it, since for me it just makes if more fun viewing experience if the film actually is good 

For *The Invisible Man*, heading in I knew the general premise based on the mad amount of trailer snippets etc. and the concept was interesting so I gave it a go.

fltqlq8,"I’d like to note first that I highly doubt that Whannell even put as much thought into this as we are but...

I believe in terms of realism, it is more likely that the suit reflects lights. There’s tons of tiny cameras on the suit, so what I assume it does is each camera takes an image of incoming light and essentially displays it through its corresponding opposite camera, and vice versa. Light cannot “pass through” matter, unless you want to fuck with quantum theory but that’s a rabbit hole. 

Essentially what the cameras do is give the illusion of invisibility by projecting reflected images in real time of the surroundings of the suit, sort of like mirrors all over your body, but projecting the images omnidirectionally. It does make sense technically, on an idea level. I believe the latest in “stealth technology” applies similar ideas",fafwsf

>Secondly, since it must be waterproof, why did pepper spray even affect the wearer in the first place?

He wasnt effected by it. We see him 15 seconds later in physical altercations. There is no way someone who was properly hit by pepper spray would be able to do what he did. Additionally, when the mask was taken off, there was no readiness of the face/eyes.

Since this was presumably the brothers first time in the suit, his first instinct to bei g sprayed with pepper spray is to move to avoid it, which is what he did. When he realized he was fine, he was back in action.

>* How does Adrian know exactly where the main character is going at all times?  I can buy maybe once or twice as stalking/lucky guesses, but seriously, 100% accuracy all the time is too much.

The only places where Adrian couldn't reasonably know ahead of time are when she goes back to his house to discover the suit, and when she goes to the restaurant right afterwards. Both of these can be explained by one line: Adrian rode to those places on the car.


>* How does Cecilia know how to operate the suit?  It's sophisticated technology, and the one time we see any semblance of operating the suit was when she pressed the wall mounted control panel to turn the suit off, implying that she would at least need to use that panel again to activate the suit.  We are expected to believe that she went to fetch the hidden suit, bring it down to the lab, figure out how to put it on and activate it, walk back to the dining room, slit Adrian's throat, run back to the lab, deactivate it, and walk back to the dining room, all while dodging the other security cameras in the house, and all before Adrian managed to bleed out from a gaping wound?

How do you know how to operate the suit? Why do you think it requires activation in the tech lab? We know that is one way to activate the suit. We dont know it is the only way.

>* And finally, the mother of all plot holes, the ward scene:  Cecilia is fighting Adrian, and has at this point stabbed him multiple times.  Adrenaline is coursing through her body and she has at this point fully committed to fight and not flight.  She gets knocked down in the hallway by Adrian, and is surrounded by several guns all within reach.  Why then does she make like a starfish and lay there for the 2 whole minutes Adrian goes on a John Wick style action montage disarming and beating on a platoon of security guards?  She had any number of chances to grab a gun and shoot him down right there.  He wasn't even fully invisible all the time.  And yet, she conveniently waits UNTIL he prances out the doorway to finally grab a gun and lightly jog after him.

We continue to see armed guards round the corner. He ends up taking them out because, well, invisible. How quickly do you think they would react to a hallway full of shot/bloodied guards with her holding the gun? The guards are equal parts adversary and ally to the main character. I totally get why she wouldnt want to cross them. In fact, when she finally did pick up the gun, my first thought was ""oh shit I hope a guard doesnt come in here now to see her holding a weapon, that will be bad news""

>* Bonus plot hole: It didn't look like he even killed all the guards; he mainly just bashed some heads against the wall, which, considering the beating the black police officer took while ending up fully recovering, had to be non lethal.  Adrian wasn't portrayed to being merciful to any degree, so why leave all those loose ends there anyway?

Because he wanted his brother to be pinned for these crimes. Adrian knew that Cecilia was going to be able to kill the brother. If Adrian made the invisibility suit conspicuous (leaving lots of witnesses) then the narrative is strengthened that  brother was behind the whole thing. It makes the ""Adrian was the victim"" story easier to sell to everyone else, which continues to keep Adrian empower over Cecilia.",fafwsf

The reason it’s important that it was Tom at the hospital is because it’s at the hospital where the invisible man says “surprise”. This leads me to believe the one who sent the text was Tom as well. Cecilia thought saying surprise was evidence enough that Adrian was the invisible man but if he didn’t even say it the previous two times, that negates her only evidence.

his brother was attacking because he either was manipulated into doing so, or he was on the brother's side the whole time, which is my stance. many times men often will stan other men, especially in cases where spousal abuse is occurring, especially if they're close, like brothers. ESPECIALLY suspect is when the brother assures her that Adrian was just not a good person. i never believed him for a second beyond his first expressing as much.

She left Adrian's phone in the house instead of taking it right to the police, for example (or just straight to James).

What I want to know is how could she prove she didn't kill him if the police knows that an invisible suit exists? She will be prime suspect #1, and she will face scrutiny.

flnevpv,[deleted],fafwsf
flt21g8,"Adding on this this, there’s obviously a lot of plot holes in this movie, but you make a good point about this being a secret project. 

A lot of the above issues are due to the fact that Cecilia knows there’s an invisible man and that the viewer knows there’s an invisible man. I don’t feel like a lot of this evidence is strong enough to immediately convince these characters that there is some secret new technology that’s making this guy invisible. It’s realistic to this that they’d just assume she’s mentally unstable. 

I could be wrong about this, but the timeline of the movie is pretty limited. Like yeah, if this took course over a month, the security footage in the restaurant would be an issue. But wasn’t she brought to the hospital immediately from there? It just seems reasonable that everyone would immediately assume that she did it instead of listening to her story about her invisible boyfriend. Same thing goes with the evidence in the attic, and the daughter getting punched in the face.  From the perspective of the other characters, it makes sense that they’d blame her instead of accepting that there is this never-before-seen or heard-of technology out there. 

To me, the biggest plot hole to me was the 2nd suit and no mention of him realizing its missing. That seems unlikely. Besides that, I thought the film did a good job of putting a viewer in a position where they’re aware of the entire situation along with the protagonist, but all of the other characters are totally in the dark.",fafwsf

The Invisible Man is a classic story done many times in many different ways, this is the worst iteration in my opinion.

fjlmetl,"OK, so explain this then, cuz it's another thing on my mind....

When she escaped the psych ward, and was chasing him in the car, she arrived at Jason's house just a couple minutes later than Tom did. 

Tom wouldn't have had the time to go to Adriens house to lock him in a dungeon given than she was relatively close behind him. So we can safely assume that Tom was the one that killed all those people at the psych ward.  So that's yet another point for Tom acting alone.

Adrien isn't a Saint by any means, but I feel like there's more than enough proof that it's at least feasible that Tom really did act alone. Perhaps he drugged Adrien, which is how he got the suicide pictures. 

Think about it.  If those were suicide pictures taken by the cops/medical examiner, they would have actually checked to see if Adrien was alive before taking pictures.  So that leads me to believe that they weren't crime scene photos, but rather were pictures taken by Tom himself.",fafwsf

flhlw3m,"SPOILERS AHEAD

In the ""Attack Sydney"" scene, I believe there were TWO attackers.  First of all, when Sydney peppersprays the air and *something* crashes into her dresser and against the wall at the head of Sydney's bed, that *something* is clearly disabled by the pepperspray.  Sydney *launches* out the door screaming - she's moving at top speed and it's a normal door width, so no room for two people to be hurtling through it at the same time.  And, at the time she started to flee, ""he"" was *behind* her.

Yet she runs into *something* that is fixed and immobile in the hallway!  So that *thing* had to *already be there* in the hallway (Tom), and the *other* one was still back in the bedroom recovering from the pepper spray (Adrian).

Two ways this could work:  Adrian's damaged suit was *mostly* functional; either it was self-diagnosing and self-repairing to some degree and/or was in a mostly-functional stage once out of the rain; OR Adrian had a spare suit in his car at all times just in case.  [Look at his laboratory](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/edDaN5cyWqooiMh6CQGGKvisKFa8-EjvDhJ7RxtGml5xZRdqxgyDjd5rFNSAYc1oY-fJ-qXgIOqzqa_tqgmC1BxxuBsBky_k2PYHsKb0yW5GUwr7IMLVjo30wrbHMCKL8dY) - that's from when she's initially fleeing, I think.  See the 4 suits on the wall?  This would only account for **3**, not counting the one in the special case that gets stolen.  It even looks like a space for a 5th suit against the wall there to the right.

Then, once the mayhem is complete, recovered-Adrian sneaks out, goes home, and ties himself up in the hidden room to wait to be discovered by the police.  Super easy to tie yourself up with zip ties.

My friend makes another argument for a spare suit for Adrian is that it would have been far more likely that he switched suits after that paint incident than tried to wash all the way up - a comprehensive cleanup would take WAY too long.  If anything, he strips off his paint-covered suit, washes his face off in the sink (we know the suit is *porous* because his breath comes out freely), then puts on the clean suit before Cecelia gets down from the attic.

My friend also feels that it is most likely that Tom did *not* realize that Adrian was still alive, that the initial meeting with Tom to read the will where Tom admits he ""hated"" Adrian and is glad he's dead, with the lip/chin wobble, Tom truly believed Adrian was dead.  But Adrian was there in the room listening; after that, Adrian apparently brought Tom in on the plan - notice Tom's very different demeanor in the psyche ward meeting room.  And then Tom is ""persuaded"" to help out with the Sydney attack. Personally, I believe Tom was in on it from the very beginning.",fafwsf

But yeah she did look super smug at the end. I don't like that she has the suit. I think that was very 'girl power' for modern viewers.

I'll stand by what I said, the attic scene was pointless.

I never said anything about the knife, but as you mention it, that it's in a bag makes it's intended use obvious, but as a prop that is never used, again it is pointless.

fjz3wmh,"Yeah. I don’t think you have ever actually experienced shock, or are aware of what happens when someone experiences it. One of the primary symptoms of shock is *dissociation*,  where the brain kinda detaches itself from the rest of the body. It’s overwhelmed, so more or less temporarily shuts down. During this period, you are very vulnerable to suggestion and being lead around.

So yes, it’s very plausible that in response to witnessing a sudden violent event against her sibling that she went into shock. This being the case, she would have be susceptible to her arm and hand being manipulated without her being consciously aware of it happening. Later, she probably wouldn’t even remember holding the knife, let alone be able to answer questions about how it got into her hand.",fafwsf

fjmmjty,"In the real world it's not necessarily what law enforcement believes, it's what they can prove. Adrian's story was ludicrous, but there was no evidence that it was anything but the truth. I wish the film framed it that way as well, instead of making it seem like everyone besides Elisabeth Moss' character knew Adrian was lying. It would have tied in well with Adrian's sudden 'suicide' as well, with Moss' character having a line implying whether it's believed he killed himself or not, there would be no proof to otherwise - as she walks out with the only other invisible suit.",fafwsf

You’re right that the cut to Cee coming out of the bathroom felt super quick. That’s definitely an editing mistake. But theoretically any amount of time could have passed.

Cool as a cucumber when saying ""surprise"" to Adrian, but emotions showing to her friend. Even though he has been terrible to her, she's not a killer and any real person would react to having - ahem - just discovered their ex-partner in a pool of blood. Even just the shock would get to someone.

But I think if we enter into the world of the film, where invisible suits exist and ordinary people can fight like ninjas, what they're showing us at the end is that she's got her strength back. And that she has no regrets over how the situation was resolved. Perhaps the being shaky or tearful might have been too subtle for some members of the audience, or complicated matters too much. It can be good to have a nice clean ending to this type of film.",fafwsf

The movie goes out of its way to showcase how hopeless Cecilias situation gets. Would it really have been that difficult to add a single line where the doctors or Adrians brother say “you’ve been found mentally deranged, so you’ll have the baby and it will go to next of kin... us.” Or something to that effect. 

Now, with none of that in the film, Cecilia continues being a reactive character who doesn’t make any choices for herself unless forced to. It takes away agency and doesn’t offer anything in return, when instead the pregnancy angle could have been a horrific scenario criticizing the all too real world in America today, where women are forced to go through pregnancies because men decree it.",fafwsf

It's quite clear he played many mind games with her when they were together, it's why she noticed these small things so quickly - take the example of the tap still being on, and the diazapam being placed in the bathroom. it's to make her think she may have done it - it's just weird enough to make her freak out but not noticable enough for anyone else.

I know I absolutely and everyone would absolutely see her as crazy if we didn't see her perspective.

Even if some of the security guys saw *all* 2 minutes of footage before bursting onto the scene, that's not a whole lot of time to rationalise ""oh, there's obviously an optics genius in an invisibility suit terrorising one of our mental patients!

Perhaps she did what I would have done and thought ""that's weird"" but not think of it as a huge deal at first. 

I also think that it's pretty clear when she finds the knife in the plastic bag in the attic, she recognizes it as the one that was missing from the kitchen... That scene to me, when the revealed the knife in the bag, was to establish that she realized that the missing knife was indeed his doing.",fafwsf

We aren't *completely* sure until he says ""surprise"" in the exact way he said it earlier.

I took this as he's so rich and powerful and influential that he can dismiss Cecilia's charges for her sister's death and get her released. Then they would live together in their home as they were previously. Adrian could end up working from the shadows and controlling his company and wealth through his brother, as he does throughout the movie. Alternatively, he could emerge saying that the news of him dying was just a rumor and fake news. It's the kind of thing that happens all the time with celebrities, so I think it's a plausible scenario.

fw1yj5e,"Its funny how you call me unemphatic and tone deaf, when thats exactly what the waiter in the movie was doing.  

Isnt it a part of a waiters job to assess his customers?  IE if they are acting depressed maybe be a bit more friendly.  If they are acting angry, give them a little more space.  If they are panicking and having a break down, be a little more courteous and not interrupt their conversation.  There is definitely a line between being unattentive, and being TO attentive.

And of course waiters are people and deserve to be treated nicely.  I personally always tip well and am friendly to them.  But in the case of the movie, the customers were obviously in a bad situation, and needed a little time to talk.  The waiter should have realized that and gave them some space.  

The customers could also have been more courteous and politely asked him to leave them alone for a little bit.  But they were very stressed and were focused on their own problem.  So its understandable that they werent very polite.

So when it comes to the movie, the waiter was definitely pestering them.  Which is a little unrealistic since most waiters can tell when to give their customers some space to work things out before asking for order details.",fafwsf

fjlvnu1,"1. Okay, how do we know it's his first time in the suit?  If he had a whole other suit made for his brother, he should definitely be using it; it would make more sense that it wasn't Adrian tormenting Cecilia at all times, and he had someone taking shifts.  Makes it more believable that way.  Plus Adrian had an entire bucket of ""milk"" dumped on his face and he didn't even budge.  Call it ""being used to the suit"" or whatever, but the massive difference in their reactions is a bit unbelievable.

2.  Adrian is invisible, not a ghost.  There is no way he could climb into the same car as Cecilia and not have either her (the super paranoid woman who is looking for the slightest hint that Adrian is there) or the driver notice.  Is he sitting in the passenger seat?  The passenger door randomly opening and closing would be a little suspicious, wouldn't it?  Did he sneak in to the other backseat?  He'd have to have gone in before Cecilia (hard to do seeing as people usually cover the entrance when they open car doors) or after her (have you tried climbing over someone to get to the other seat?  Not very subtle).  Maybe he just clings to the roof of the car Mission Impossible style.  He should then star in the next installation of that franchise.

3.  We only know what we're shown obviously, and we're shown what Cecilia sees.  She found the suit hooked up to a whole apparatus with a control panel that she used to deactivate the suit.  That was the extent of her learning how the suit works and what we know as well.  Now, if there's a handy dandy all inclusive invisible suit wiki/manual she can Google, that would explain a lot.  You can find anything on the internet these days so finding a detailed guide on how to operate invisibility suits would be totally believable.  Maybe it's on Wikihow or on an instructional YouTube guide video. /s

4.  It's funny because they always come in a couple at a time and then get immediately destroyed by invisibro, and they never come in when he's in the middle of his long and drawn out execution sequences.  They also appear to be the absolute least trigger happy security guards in all of America.  Much of our cops could learn a thing or two from this truly exemplary trigger discipline.  In those very long windows of time, all Cecilia had to do was point and shoot once.  There was ample time to do it.  Hell, shooting the gun would probably also help her out by drawing the full force of the security team out at once so they might have had a chance.

5.  And come on.  Him planning on Cecilia getting a gun, escaping the psych ward, stealing a car, escaping any and all police officers while she drives like a madman trying to reach the cop's house, and then shooting his invisible brother, while he fucks off to tie himself up BDSM style in the basement is quite the plot convenience.",fafwsf

1. Did the world know about Adrian's fake suicide? Was everyone paid off and fake articles were made? Not sure how you could fake your death and walk free, and then surprise news headline ""Local optics pioneer kills himself twice in a month"".
2. James was 100% not having Cecilias shit when she appeared to kill her sister (who was James/Cecilias connection in the first place?), but upon witnessing that Cecilia just kills Adrian and was plotting it, he's like nah I didn't see anything all good? Also she calls 911, leaves a crime scene with evidence, is on security camera, so is she an invisible vigilante in the sequel now?
3. I may be recalling this incorrectly, but the scene where James and his daughter fight Tom in the house, she first sprays him with pepper spray and he falls into the dresser, and then when running away towards the front of the house, she gets punched back into the direction of her room? Wouldn't that insinuate that Tom either has super speed as well, or that both Adrian and Tom were there? Idk, just something I noticed since we see Adrian tied up later (presumably while that scene took place).",fafwsf
fk01dob,Why didnt the doctor tell Cecilia that her pregnancy test was positive?,fafwsf
flpeoju,"None of the problems you pointed out really seemed damning for the film. Its completely plausible that the ultra high tech invisible suit could have some power assistance and some form of noise cancelling stuff. Especially considering the purposes the suit was likely created for in the first place.

About the security camera password it seems that adrian wasn't overly careful and often underestimated Cecilia, evident when she initially managed to escape and also when she got him to reveal himself by acting like she was going to kill herself. All this only to say I think its reasonable to believe that Cecilia would know adrians password to his computer.

The prescription bottle would not go very far to convince someone that a man thought to be dead is actually stalking her in an invisibility suit.

Overall I didn't feel the movie made any great leaps in logic and was quite believable in a world where a man can make a totally invisible suit. However I do agree it would have been better to help the audience understand certain decisions rather than leave it open to interpretation and some scenes could have been cleaner, like when the girl got slapped, the restaurant etc.

One thing tho, why do you want to sway people away from the film? If someone was able to see past the problems and enjoy it I think its strange you'd want to change their experience with the movie to a negative one.",fafwsf

He said it to her at the dinner table cos he knew that she knew it was him all along but, as was said all along by Cecilia he likes to make her feel crazy, so he would never admit it but saying ‘surprise’ in the way he did would be as close to admitting it as he would get without explicitly saying so. It would also be enough for Cecilia to think she had more credibility in here claim despite Adrian pleading his innocence, adding more to him making her feel crazy. The movie definitely did have a few plot holes tho, but I do feel the intent was to let us as the audience know Adrian was in on it all along.",fafwsf
fkfzqvx,"I disagree with the idea it's calculated - she went there hoping to get him to confess. He did, but not in a way that would be usable as evidence. He did, however, make it clear that he would continue to abuse her. She took the initiative, and make sure he didn't have the chance to. That's the right thing to do. If you have the initiative with a proven abuser, take it. I agree that coercing her best friend into being an accessory was uncomfortable - but was it really a worse option than giving Adrian the chance to continue to threaten her, her chosen family, and her child? 

To that point, I don't think it would be as impactful or meaningful if Adrian died in James' home, because that still wouldn't be her taking the initiative.

Now as to why she left the camera suit there, and didn't take at least a piece of it with her... or why the police didn't either put Adrian in custody while they figured it out, or her in protective custody... well, those are just plot holes.",fafwsf

Now, considering the film’s entire premise, I highly doubt Adrian would simply wait at the dining table while she goes to the other room; where she hid the suit; and then take the time to put on the suit. The suit is never shown how it’s put on but I can only guess that it takes quite a bit of time to actually put on. She was also mic’d up so the rustling of the suit would have been heard by her police friend outside. 

I know the way that it was edited makes it seem like it happened so fast but it’s hard not to ignore the time it would have actually taken for her to do all those things. Not to mention Adrian’s house is filled with cameras, which he has access to wirelessly on his phone.

The real clincher for me is 'What motive does Tom have for any of it?' Maybe to get her to commit a crime so that she forfeits her share of the money, but then why carry on after framing her for the murder of her sister?

You make a good case in your other post but I feel that if you were legitimately the victim of harsh domestic violence. And it was found you drugged your partner with sleeping pills so that you could escape, you wouldn’t really be in that much trouble. 

There isn’t a side effect of sleeping pills that aggregate violence is there?",fafwsf
fjfv25u,"If you think someone secretly giving you a sleeping aide can have the valid response of chasing down your spouse who is obviously trying to get away from you, punching in a car window, and then choking them with your bare hands until the car physically speeds off (all the while screaming “get back here!”) I have terrible news for you. 

Ambien is the sleeping aide that has the rare side effect of the person doing things (possibly out of character) and not remembering. She gave him Valium. Valium is simply a sedative that reduces aggression and mellows you out. So when you see Adrian violently chasing down his wife, punching in a car window (with no regard for the sister in law) and grab her by the neck attempting to strangle her **he is at his most calm because he is literally sedated.**

It obviously wasn’t a significant dose as he woke up nearly instantly to a car alarm on a different level of a gigantic mansion that is literally on a seaside cliff to the ocean. His bedroom which has a gigantic window facing this would either be flooded with sounds of the ocean crashing or be sound proof to the point the car alarm would be faint. 

Furthermore, if my concern were my safety from the “abuser” who just drugged me so they could sneak out, I certainly wouldn’t blindly chase them into a wooded area to attack them. Certainly any argument that would stand in court goes out the window the moment you punch in a car window to try to strangle them as they flee. Never mind we as the viewer know that he was unaware of the pills until she dropped them scrambling to get into the car. He is acting this way only knowing she is trying to sneak out in the middle of the night.

The second Cecilia found Adrian's phone, she had her smoking gun. A picture of her, asleep in her bed, on *his fucking phone*. Boom, that's enough to at least get people asking questions. What does she do? Leaves it behind. Then there was the daughter, who was somehow convinced that Cecilia hit her while she was on the ground in the fetal position 10 feet away, and hit her hard enough to knock her over.

This Adrian dude was a fucking genius mastermind, so smart that he even found a way to tell Cecilia ""you're not crazy, I was responsible for all of it"" without actually implicating himself if anyone else was listening. But he just left the other suit lying around and had no expectations of her betraying him?

Either the entire thing happened so fast that she had no time to react, in which case she wouldn't have been in shock and her body would've resisted being grabbed, or she would've had the time to actually realize what happened in which case the jnife wouldn't have just gone flying into her hand.

Elisabeth Moss in contrast has been building a acclaimed career as a leading lady in indie movies. Yes they are indie movies but the acclaimed she has help her go towards more serious challenging roles. I mean her first real blockbuster the invisible man was number 1 at the box office last week with a 62 million dollar gross. Has Jon hamm ever had a box office hit in a LEADING role or even a movie that was well received. And please don’t say baby driver cause that was a supporting role. Plus Moss is executive producer and star of her own show the handmaids tale in addition maintains a film career at the same time.

Hard to say how to react in situations like that but the cell phone alone would have proven something weird was going on.

fjn8qym,"> Okay, how do we know it's his first time in the suit? If he had a whole other suit made for his brother, he should definitely be using it; it would make more sense that it wasn't Adrian tormenting Cecilia at all times, and he had someone taking shifts. Makes it more believable that way. Plus Adrian had an entire bucket of ""milk"" dumped on his face and he didn't even budge. Call it ""being used to the suit"" or whatever, but the massive difference in their reactions is a bit unbelievable.

How do we know it's not his first time in the suit? You are making assumptions that you want to believe make sense, even though the story is being told in a way that to suggest that those assumptions are wrong. If Adrian is the narcissist controller that the movie suggests he is, I think it's just as likely that he would insist on carefully piloting every detail of Cecilia's torture. That's what this whole plan was all about. He clearly went to great lengths to ensure he could do this. Why would he need to work in shifts? He is ""dead."" He doesn't need to fuck off to go to work. There are no other grand parts of his scheme to work on. He could literally spend all of his time invisible while tormenting her. Or he could spend only 2% of the time - the bulk of the movie takes place over what, three weeks? And we only see a dozen interactions with Cecilia and an invisible person. He didn't need to be around all the time.

> Adrian is invisible, not a ghost. There is no way he could climb into the same car as Cecilia and not have either her (the super paranoid woman who is looking for the slightest hint that Adrian is there) or the driver notice. Is he sitting in the passenger seat? The passenger door randomly opening and closing would be a little suspicious, wouldn't it? Did he sneak in to the other backseat? He'd have to have gone in before Cecilia (hard to do seeing as people usually cover the entrance when they open car doors) or after her (have you tried climbing over someone to get to the other seat? Not very subtle). Maybe he just clings to the roof of the car Mission Impossible style. He should then star in the next installation of that franchise.

I agree, there is zero percent chance that he was in the car with her. But the movie clearly shows the car taking a long time doing a three point turn, and it also shows the car has one of those stepping platforms on the side. He could be on the roof or on the side. If Adrian is not on the car, what else would have allowed Adrian to follow Cecilia so quickly and so precisely? I think it's funny that a lot of movie goers complain that movies don't treat their audiences with respect and go out of their way to show or explain something simple, but the moment a movie assumes the audience will reach an obvious conclusion, people cry ""plot hole."" 

> We only know what we're shown obviously, and we're shown what Cecilia sees. She found the suit hooked up to a whole apparatus with a control panel that she used to deactivate the suit. That was the extent of her learning how the suit works and what we know as well. Now, if there's a handy dandy all inclusive invisible suit wiki/manual she can Google, that would explain a lot.

Again, the movie is asking us to connect dots to explain what we don't see. The movie could have showed us Cecilia getting into the suit and doing what needed to happen to, and everything would be wrapped up in a nice little logical bow and nobody would ever be able to cry plot hole. There would be no mystery or atmosphere to the end, the momentum would be absolutely destroyed, and the editing of the final ten minutes would make for an overall worse experience. The movie would be boring as fuck because movies aren't about ""connect the plot dots."" They are about theme and character. Plot is just the superficial tool used to connect theme and character together; it doesn't actually matter. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9HivyjAKlc

> It's funny because they always come in a couple at a time and then get immediately destroyed by invisibro, and they never come in when he's in the middle of his long and drawn out execution sequences. They also appear to be the absolute least trigger happy security guards in all of America. Much of our cops could learn a thing or two from this truly exemplary trigger discipline. In those very long windows of time, all Cecilia had to do was point and shoot once. There was ample time to do it. Hell, shooting the gun would probably also help her out by drawing the full force of the security team out at once so they might have had a chance.

If they ran into the hallway to find several incapacitated guards with Cecilia holding a gun, instead of several guards with her cowering on the ground, their reaction might have been quite a bit more trigger happy. During those long windows of time in which an invisible person was near an innocent person, it's perfectly reasonable that someone that might not have training with a firearm could be hesitant to try and shoot someone. Even if I could see the assailant, I'd be super hesitant. Make the guy invisible? No fucking way. What if I miss and hit a guard? Just because a character does something that you wouldn't do, doesn't mean that it is a bad character decision or a plot hole or anything like that. It is perfectly reasonable not to pick up a gun in that instance, even if you think it would have been better if she did.

> And come on. Him planning on Cecilia getting a gun, escaping the psych ward, stealing a car, escaping any and all police officers while she drives like a madman trying to reach the cop's house, and then shooting his invisible brother, while he fucks off to tie himself up BDSM style in the basement is quite the plot convenience.

Well yeah. That's a plot convenience because that is the plot. The suit shown in the psych ward was malfunctioning after being stabbed. That wuit would frequently become uninvisible. When he spoke, it sounded like Adrian. Later on, when the invisible man attacked at the house, the suit was working fine; no malfunction. It's clearly a different suit and a different person. Do you not think that Adrian, genius narcissist manipulator, had an ""emergency backup plan"" in case something like this happened? Where he can get ahold of his brother, tell him ""Hey gtf over to the cops house and fuck shit up."" In case things go in an unexpected direction? If the brother succeeds in fucking shit up.....Great! The invisible man lives to torture another day. If not? Adrian then has plenty of time to BDSM himself in the basement of his house. The SWAT team was shown breaching his house as the sun was rising IIRC so he would have actually had hours to get to his house and get it done. And much of that could be set up ahead of time to make the set up quick.

We know that's the plot because the theme of the movie is about gaslighting and being manipulated. You as the audience member have been gaslighted into questioning how much Adrian actually did, and how much was done by his brother. *That's the point*. It's a terrifying theme executed so brilliantly by the director that you aren't even aware of what's happening. Which, again, is the point.",fafwsf

James and Sydney were charismatic but were pretty flat.

Edit: Sorry I keep going on this. Adrian didn't do much for me either. Started bad, ended bad. Main issue with that character is that you mostly hear about it rather than see it (which is tough when invisibility is part of the story), but I could have used a little more fleshing out there.",fafwsf

2. what evidence bro on the camera you can see she goes to the bathroom and adrian kills himself with the knife and when she comes back she is suprised.
so what evidence ? clear footage of suicide and she was also wearing a wire so its pretty open and shut case - the only one who knew the truth was James and he let her go since shes been through enough i guess and he knows she didnt kill her sister or slap his daughter
also there will probably be no sequel
3.its only tom there and he pulled her back he didnt punch her ;D

you should know that adrian knows everything cecillia does except the hidden suit and the ending
he knew she had a wire , he knew she would call james and warn him about his daughter so he went home pretended to be kidnapped and sent his brother to fill the narrative of this not being adrian's fault",fafwsf

As the 2nd person to shrug off this HUGE plot hole I think it's only reasonable that you fill in that plot hole. Considering your dismissal of what I believe to be reasonable objections to the films terrible execution, I believe you should explain the bottle and how Adrian became the first person in history to conpletely rinse paint off himself in 5 seconds.

And this is where empowerment as a theme comes in. A fight at the end doesn't do it. Winning a fight is a matter of luck, and is also run-of-the-mill. Doing what Cecelia did cleverly turns the tables on Adrian in a way that, in a way, she learned from him. Her victory has to be masterful, not physical. And as I mentioned in a post above, it is strictly preemptive self-defence.

Also, upon first viewing, I wondered why she hid the suit in Adrian's house. (I also questioned why Adrian left all his Invisible Man machinery open for inspection.) But on second viewing, I realized that the dog barking led Cecelia to  realize that Adrian was there, so she couldn't be caught red-handed with the suit. Now, would the dog bark at his own owner?

He was also on his own camera which could be reviewed later but thats not a super strong excuse for not checking his phone.

Im not as bothered by the time to put the suit on even though its a pretty fair point. Its just not something thats so unbelievable to ruin it for me.

I did find it extremely unlikely that Adrian would t have found the suit beforehand. He heard her hinting that she had “something” to prove he was alive to the cops and it had to be pretty damn obvious to him that something was the extra suit. He had time in his house alone that he could have easily searched the place up and down, and knew the room she hid in for a little while during their chase.

Paradoxical Effects

A paradoxical effect is one that should be eliminated by use of the drug but instead, it shows up stronger when the drug is used. With Valium, these effects can include fits of rage or violence, aggression, excitement, irritability, and hostility. A person may lose control of his impulses which can lead to anti-social behavior, especially among the very young and elderly. Some people may consider suicide. Others may become emotionally blunted.

I really don't care about plot holes, tbh, because who cares?  Its a movie, I can suspend my disbelief and enjoy it......but....

Adrian is in the mental hospital with C.  (how does he eat, sleep, use the bathroom)  Tom comes in and reveals the plot to C.   Adrian is in the room.  He is everywhere with her, listening.  When C knocks everything off the table, doesn't Adrian see her take the pen and the tacky stuff?    Back in the cell, Adrian is standing there.  When did C get the chance to hide the pen without Adrian seeing this?     Then she stabs the suit, Adrian messes up a dozen cops and they both make it out of the mental institution in the rain (through double unlocked doors and a gate) and isnt this where Adrian finally tells her that its now her fault that Sydney (Lanier, after the poet) will be the one that gets killed?   So what happens next?   Does Adrian call Tom and tell him to do the deed while Adrian then heads to his house and ties himself up?   How does Adrian know that the cops will even come to his house?   I thought C had told the cops about the hidden suit, but realized she did not because she already had a plan to kill Adrian with the suit to avenge her sister.  So, the only thing that makes sense is that the cops go to Adrian's house because it was the source of the suit?   Maybe C keeps up her ranting that Adrian is alive and because of James' recent experience they go to check it out?

fjqivv7,"First of all, your assumption that it's the brother's first time in the suit and my assumption that it's probably not is based on exactly the same evidence.  You saying that yours is more valid than mine is simply your opinion.  If what you say is true and Adrian is spending all his efforts in being Casper the Unfriendly Ghost, then he wouldn't need to make a third suit.  He had a second suit (which he ""lost"") which would have been his back up, and he could use that to loan to his brother if he needed to in the future.  But no, Adrian had a THIRD suit made for his brother, maybe even more, who knows.  If he's going this far to mass produce suits, then it's a no brainer to include some kind of training for whoever would be using the extra suits.

As for the ward...  So, Cecilia is hesitant to shoot a semi invisible target who she has a decent idea on his positioning, who is in a very confined space of a few meters wide, further reducing her chances of missing, and who spends prolonged periods of time with his back to her as he toys with the guards.  But, she is no longer hesitant to go out into the dark, stormy night, where she can no longer see shit, and wave around a gun blasting shots willy nilly?  Secondly, she was already mentally prepared to die; one doesn't stab a pen straight into their vein and cut vertically and expect to come out fine and dandy (and by the way, she should be bleeding out on the floor from her gaping wound and not be chasing mad men across town like James Bond).  And lastly, you and her both are missing quite literally her strongest weapon: Adrian would not let her die.  He literally said that straight to her face, and it's pretty much the entire reason he's going through all that effort to beating up the guards.  He could have easily slipped out the entrance despite his malfunctioning suit, and we see that quite clearly when none of the front desk guards have any idea he was there, and half of the security guards running in looked straight at Cecilia/the downed guards and not the flickering man (none of them fired on Cecilia by the way, despite her being the only ""probable culprit"", gun or no gun in hand).

This is quite literally the best chance she could have hoped for.  1: she has guns available.  2: Adrian isn't attacking her.  3: Adrian is instead knocking out every security guard coming her way, her only other possible threat.  All she literally has to do is quickly grab a gun and spray and pray in front of her, at least one of the shots will hit him.  If she succeeds, she has a bleeding/dead body to pin the crimes on.  If she fails, she can drop the gun and imitate a starfish like she was doing prior, or she can grab one of the dozen other guns in the vicinity and try again.  Adrian already fired several gunshots so it's not like that would draw any more attention to her.  She knew enough about guns to execute the brother in the end, so it would be easy enough for her to squeeze out an entire magazine in less than 10 seconds.

As for clinging to the car, that just does not add up.  First of all, that is ridiculously dangerous; if a single car passes the Lyft an inch too close, that is game over for Adrian.  That car ride was stated to be an extremely far distance away, which means Adrian would have to be hanging there for at least 30 minutes, generously speaking, all the while combating heavy wind resistance trying to drag him off the car.  That's some video game logic.

Plus, even if he somehow managed to pull off such a Herculean feat, that would mean he arrived at his mansion at the same time as Cecilia, which means he could tail her right from the get go, see that she discovered the spare suit, and watch her hide it in a rather obvious hidey hole.  That would invalidate the ending as Cecilia used that hidden suit to get her revenge.  We also literally see that Adrian arrived much later than Cecilia, and she was able to hide herself in the closet without him knowing, and that's how she escaped.

Look.  I'm all for movies asking us to use our imagination a little to fill in some blanks.  However, movies establish specific rules for them to follow, and then rely on the environment to fill in the other implicit rules they didn't specify.  In this movie's case, they've set their environment as modern day earth with the inclusion of mad scientist invisibility suits.  They defined their explicit rule as ""There is a guy smart enough to make several invisibility suits and they 100% work.""  That's fine.  I can accept that.  Their environment of modern day earth however has implicit rules: the laws of physics still apply, humans should function like humans, and most things we take for granted in our own world hold true in this movie's world.  When movies start breaking some of these rules, the audience gets less and less immersed in the story, and that's never a good thing.  I'm not even alone in my opinions, many other viewers and even critics have noted that you simply have to turn your brain off at some parts of the movie to fully appreciate it.",fafwsf

flqe0ro,"Well firstly about the bottle, Cecilia had been living with Adrian for an indeterminate amount of time. The blood could just as likely got onto the bottle during this time. However I think the most important factor in her not using it as evidence is that the story of the bottle already had his blood on it and she brought it home when she escaped is so vastly more believable than the story of him faking his death and then using an invisible suit to bring the bottle back to her. This is not a HUGE plot hole.

Secondly, about the paint, its reasonable to assume that with whatever nefarious intentions adrian had for the suit he would have known one of the weaknesses of the suit would be it being made visible by materials sticking to it and built it with some kind of non stick surface making it easier to clean and remain consealed. This is somewhat of a stretch since the movie never suggests that this is the case but it is totally believe that he could have done something like this with the suit.

On the point about adrian getting to his house so quickly I'd say its possible he knew or assumed she would go to his house and went there and it's plausible that creepy adrian with his invisibility suits would have some alternative way to get in and out of his own house.

That covers those points but I think its very much unnecessary to explain these things as none of them are unreasonable to assume. Its not like there would be a huge gaping film-destroying plot hole if adrian could clean paint off himself in 5 seconds. Its just how films work, sometimes liberties are taken for a better viewing experience. If Cecilia just didn't think of using the bottle as evidence its not ruining the movie.

The movie did a lot of good. It built good tension had a really interesting premise and was mostly well executed. There was a lot of creepiness and a lot of unexpected things happening. It was very enjoyable if you can accept that adrian can rinse off really quickly.

I still would think that Adrian would have gone to check up on her at some point. And perhaps there’s a deleted scene where he does and he just returns to the table to wait for her. 

We know for certain that two working suits exist; my guess is it’s a suit for each brother. So I agree with you that it’s extremely unlikely Adrian would have forgotten the other suit. Unless of course he had no use for it or they both shared one suit and the other suit was just hanging in that room as a back-up.",fafwsf

If so she’d eventually be found if she’s going to a different hotel every night and if she isn’t declared missing I’d imagine someone like James would know where she is unless she’s just fled the state or country without telling anyone and at that point she would be declared missing.

I’d also imagine the money would stop going into her account if she did any of this seeing as its from Adrian and Tom is also in on everything and involved in the money side of things. So once her money runs out she’s fucked basically and back to square one. Also she wouldn’t just hide or flee anyway cos she’s knows she’s right about it all and doesn’t want to be made to look crazy by Adrian any more, she’s sick of his shit and wants to put a stop to it.",fafwsf

Withdrawal, addiction, etc. can be different but that obviously doesn’t apply to a single dose. And certainly wouldn’t apply while you’re under the effects of them. Never mind that, again, Adrian is not aware he’s sedated until after he finds the pills she dropped.

It’s not open ended to the viewer. Certain characters like the detective may have to take a leap of faith and trust her judgment, but the viewer is shown the text, the whispered “surprise” when she is passing out from being sedated at the psych hospital, and the angled camera/emphasis on the “surprise” at dinner. 

We are told through cinematography that it’s not open ended. The idea that she dumped paint on the invisible man, then had the invisible man whoop her ass and frame her for the murder of her sister just to fool the audience is incoherent yet I keep seeing Adrian apologists on this thread insist it’s all a big ruse and she’s the abuser all along.",fafwsf

He’s fucking invisible, of course he could have recovered the knife. Also, it looks exactly the same. Fine if you think it would have been too hard for him to recover the knife, but that was clearly part of the point of the attic scene.

I’m not trying to cover for anything lol I just can’t believe I’m arguing about some of the less problematic details of a pretty decent thriller with some bloke online. 

We, as the audience are allowed a better perspective of the weirdness of a literally invisible man than any of the characters in the movie.

Putting all of the intracacies of domestic abuse aside, which once again, almost never involve the authorities, it's a way of building tension, giving us the lay of the house, setting up the hiding spot in the vent, foreshadowing the birth control and setting the tone of the entire film, also Cee was leaving in the middle of the night in hopes of getting out without him waking up, so that she could have time to get away without him knowing where she is going.

I would presume gaslighting has to be more intentional than that. He did not want him to discover that asian girl was a robot, he didn't want him to question his sanity.

His actions while being drugged would likely not help her, as a lawyer could reference decades of recorded paradoxical reactions.

Once again, I said it’s open-ended in some regards.

There is actually no solid proof that he was the Invisible Man. Your last paragraph means nothing because we never actually see his face underneath the suit.

The knife was literally in between them, in front of their faces, which is why the sister was staring at it. And then there's the problem highlighted by your further statement

He would have had to move it into position in front of the sister's face for it to float there even for that brief moment. And when things are moved in from your periphery to the focal point in front of your face, you tend to notice them.

There's also a problem of the dude walking in to the restaurant, all the way up to their table, with a floating knife. It seems highly unlikely that nobody would have noticed a floating knife waltzing through the place.

I’m not saying you’re automatically a terrible person for using it, but this thread pretending like shock collar work by magic buzzes that cause no harm to anybody is a fantasy so we can feel better about our training techniques. The point is to establish a relationship between that buzz and a painful stimulus that follows thereafter so that the fear of the pain is greater than the desire to continue the behavior. It has been shown repeatedly that the use of shock collars lead to higher resting levels of stress hormones in the blood stream as well as increased “stress” behavior such as vocalizing or licking the lips.

fj682p3,">And your analogy of dog == toddler is silly. Do we teach toddlers to shit in the yard? Do toddlers get skinned for their fur in certain countries? Do we make toddlers eat out of dishes on the floor as a society? No, because toddler != dog.

Firstly, this isn't an analogy, it's a straight forward comparison. 

Secondly, no, toddlers don't shit in yards, but they are trained to shit in a potty - in this instance, would you train a toddler to shit in a potty by using an electric shock collar? This is entirely my point and you're being disingenuous to make this about how dogs shit in yards.

Similar to my point above: No, toddlers don't get skinned for their fur in other countries and this is massively missing the point of my comparison. At not point do I state that a toddler is physically the same as a dog. 

I only make reference to a toddler's behaviour and the teaching of learned behaviours to be similar to how we teach and train animals. At that point in a child's life, they have no understanding of cultural and societal norms, they don't understand that having a tantrum because they can't get their own way is not acceptable behaviour, just like a dog shitting in the house is also unacceptable. 

In the literal sense, they are both mammals that can't behave in acceptable ways and need training. My point is that you wouldn't train a toddler by electric shock because it's cruel, therefore, using the same technique on a dog is also cruel.

You seem hung up on this dog !=toddler thing, when it's a comparison of how we train a dog vs how we train a toddler. Using electric shocks to train an animal is a cruel way to train any living being. You can't justify it.

It also strikes me that this may be a cultural thing, maybe in the US this is seen as an acceptable method of training, but in other first world countries this would be seen as animal cruelty.",fafwsf

Then the rest can proceed as normal, except take out the cop disapproving of it since while the reaction was natural, it threw off the viewer feeling Moss was justified. 

The whole movie you're supposed to feel sorry for Moss and the abuse she suffered, but the final scene is her committing premeditated murder against what seems like a nice guy/her cop friend disapproving.

The movie does need to make that clear if it’s gonna justify a premeditated murder scene by the protagonist. It also shouldn’t add in the cop disapproving of it.

fn40efh,"lol I've explained several times why it makes sense, but okay here's a summary along with some more thoughts:

1. The whole movie is about a woman being unable to leave an abusive relationship, and the lengths that abusive partners can go to. Aside from the invisible stuff it's pretty close to what many abused women have experienced, being stalked and threatened by partners that they've left. His goal is to punish her, but also to make her feel alone and unsupported by her friends and family, so that in the end she'll feel like her only option is to return to him. Part of that is for him to pretend to be changed man, so that she can believe that things will ""be different this time"", a sentiment heard from abused partners regularly as they return back to their abusive partners. With this in mind, the whole relationship-part of the film makes perfect sense. 

2. James, the cop, looks disapproving of her action because he's a cop and instead of going the right way of trying to get a confession out of him, she realises that she isn't gonna get it (or knew all along that she wouldn't) and exacts revenge instead.

Never proven in the movie that it was true, only Moss’s words. Your assumption only, which is why I bring up the bad writing aspect since the 2 scenes with husband are him as a victim and then him being nice/manipulative before being murdered. You filled in the blanks yourself instead of the movie doing its job. 

The movie can have the abuse tropes it leans on, but those tropes usually don’t want to paint the abused with premeditated murder under zero tangible proof if that’s what they’re going for. The cop sketched out in the end seems to make this murkier, like Cry Wolf does.

Also I don't believe that the suit was glitching considering that would be an issue with the actual software, it's clear that the reason it was malfunctioning was due to the damages it recieved, I don't see how rebooting the system would fix these damages, if your phone screen is cracked no amount of Turning it off and on will fix those damages. There's even more evidence to support the fact that the suit was physically damaged considering the only other time we see the suit get revealed in the same way is when Cecilia shoots Tom while he's in the suit, I think it's pretty clear that when the suit faces physical damage it begins to malfunction.",fafwsf

fn2keor,"Well then what are we arguing about then? We seem to both agree that people have different opinions about things. And if you change your expectations you’ll enjoy something more. The only thing we seem to disagree about is if the movie was bad or good, which is just opinion based. Agree to disagree?",fafwsf
flphe7b,Something that supports the idea that Tom was the only one in the suit is that throughout the movie there were several shots of empty spaces to imply the invisible man is there. This never happens when Tom is in the scene. Might suggest it was Tom all along.,fafwsf
fm7eo1x,But I am objectively and provably correct. Sorry you can't understand simple arguments. I only get overbearing in the presence of unfathomable ignorance and hostility (as is the case from the original dipshit and yourself).,fafwsf

fn5drip,"No, your original argument is that any preconceived notions about a movie before seeing it will affect whether you think it’s bad or good. You said you thought the movie was going to be bad, and after watching it you thought it was bad. My argument is that if you set your expectations too high then you won’t enjoy it, or if you think it’s going to be bad than there is no point to watching it. That’s what the original guy was saying too, who I agree to. You don’t think that, so I disagree with you.",fafwsf
fm7fxmu,"The size of my dick was never brought up until dipshit decided to try to shame me. That's on him, not on me. I called him out on it and he ran off like a cretinous fuckhole.

>Except you provide no objective proof,

And neither does he, so you should also be calling him out. Clearly you're heavily biased and cannot see the reality of the situation. Try harder, it will come eventually.

I have purchased and worn the collar, it hurts and causes pain, which was my original point. He said it didn't cause pain - it does. 

He also called me out for not knowing how they work or what the pain feels like, despite not wearing one himself, so he's also a hypocrite. I stated that I knew what a static shock felt like and that wasn't good enough for him, so I bought one to prove him wrong. Mission accomplished.

The only thing left for me to do is to upload an image of me wearing one to prove once and for all who is the immature fuckhead and who was right all along.",fafwsf
fjxyg1j,Wow you're a dick. You just made an argument against yourself. The chick in the movie was around a toxic guy too,fafwsf

fn5ecd1,"I don’t like talking about the way people talk but when you use phrases like “idiot” and “easy” it makes you seem immature and makes your points seem less valid. You seem capable of making a solid argument and don’t need to use such phrases to emphasize your point. Try not to use those and you will have an easier time when talking to people. And with that said I still respect you as a person. It seems that we agree though! The original guy wasn’t saying that was *always* the case but it does happen. A negative mindset will affect how you see the movie, but not always.",fafwsf
fm7gmrz,"I'm not grossly exaggerating anything, I haven't said they cause excruciating agony, I've said they cause pain, which they do. My original point was that they cause pain and it is not a humane or reasonable method of training a dog (or any animal). 

My second point was that this is a cultural difference, outside of the US, at least where I'm from, these electric shock collars aren't used widely or accepted as humane. To give an example, I've since spoken with over 50 other people (small sample size, but it gets my point across), who all agreed they would never use one and it's a cruel way to train a dog.",fafwsf

fn5gup1,"This is an opinion based discussion. I’m sorry that you view things so black and white, I know this makes it hard to talk to people when you cannot see things from any other perspective other than yours. It also seems like your pride is too high and you view everything as being a win lose or a right wrong situation. I hope that you grow out of this or this is just a persona you have on the internet because this isn’t good. I wish you the best, bye.",fafwsf
fn5jerh,You can stop trying now little doggy.,fafwsf
fn5lj24,"Your getting to a point where you can’t even make an argument, you just say phrases thinking they make you seem like you won. There’s nothing to win here, but the only thing to lose is the way perceive you. Saying little doggy and patronizing people doesn’t make you seem any type of way other than arrogant and people don’t want to listen to arrogant people. As previously said, I hope you grow out of this because it will not help you in any regard, it just points out your lack of an actual response and shows that your compensating by trying to patronize the other person.",fafwsf
