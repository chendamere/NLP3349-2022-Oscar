hlvhzjj,Okay but heart fucking broke when I saw Bruno’s table setting. That has to be the most quietly heartbreaking things I’ve ever seen in a Disney movie.,r0uwz0

hm5iv1n,So the cousin can't keep a secret for 5min at dinner but has been hearing Bruno in the walls for how many years and never bothered to mention it..?,r0uwz0
hlvjpzi,"mirabel’s gift being bringing her family to reality was such a great peaceful resolution, but i really wish we saw what kind of room casita built for her! after all that work repairing generational trauma she deserves all
the sewing machines and skeins of yarn she wants.",r0uwz0
hlzxd14,"I just want to mention the yellow butterflies. They are an iconic piece of One Hundred Years of Solitude that have become a symbol for Colombia and magical realism, meaning the occurrence of life and joy in the middle of grim circumstances. I had a big smile when one of them showed up in the river by the end of the movie, it was kind of the same story told once again.

But the first time we saw a yellow butterfly was when they show Mariano in love with Isabela, resembling Mauricio Babilonia’s character in the book, who was always followed by yellow butterflies when in love.

Edit: my first award! Thank u!",r0uwz0

hlzofwr,"I haven't seen it posted already so I'll just comment this: Mirabel's skirt/dress is beautifully animated, and it really popped to me during The Family Madrigal. Can't wait to see this again, probably in 3D this time.",r0uwz0
hlzgor0,"I loved this movie. Surface Pressure was definitely my favorite song. Bawled like a bitch throughout the movie. I was happy that there was no real villan. Its true the grandma was a huge fuckin asshole, but I wouldnt classify her as a villain. Just a dick. And once she had her eyes opened to how her dick behavior had negatively impacted her family, she changed. I do wish she had a more over time transition though. Kinda seems like she just got slapped in the face with the consequences of her actions and then was like ""oh shit what have I done"" and that was that. Otherwise, I had a great time seeing it and Ill prolly get it on dvd when its out",r0uwz0
hm4ds5g,"So, I don't know if I'm crazy here, but everything on the internet is stating that there is ""no physical antagonist"" in this movie and that the antagonist is more thematic in terms of ""generational trauma"" but....Abuela Alma is like, ABSOLUTELY the antagonist here right?  Like, just because she learns her lesson doesn't make her behavior less downright toxic to the other members of her family for a healthy chunk of the movie...",r0uwz0
hm88dyu,"Just saw it, loved it. Some observations:

- The shape-shifting cousin had chameleons on his poncho. I didn't notice this til the end, but what a nice detail.

- Of course Bruno's visions are glass panes. What is glass made of? Sand.

- Recognized Abuela's voice from In The Heights immediately, which was cool. Didn't realize til afterwards that Mirabel was in the movie version as well.

- All the musical sequences. I'm a slut for musical sequences in animation and these were all incredible. We Don't Talk About Bruno is of course the stand-out one. Can't wait til that's on Youtube to rewatch it and soak in more of the animation details.

- Speaking of Bruno, I did think his character design looked a little young, which was kind of odd? I remember seeing shots of him in one of the trailers a few weeks ago and thinking ""okay, that guy's gotta be our love interest character"". Oops.",r0uwz0

Such an earworm.",r0uwz0
hm41qe5,"Question, Mirabel was basically ostracized because she didn’t have a gift and in her Abuela’s eyes could not help their community. But who the hell was Camilo helping with his gift? How can shapeshifting really help anyone?",r0uwz0
hm7z6em,"Honestly, I really loved it which is why it's shortcomings were so pronounced to me. The visuals were gorgeous, and the notion of having it set essentially in one house is a concept that I loved. The powers were all very cute and interesting. But the plot pacing was so, so strange. One major instance I can remember was >!the fight between the main character and the grandma!<. I feel like that should have happened halfway through the movie, but it happened like 85% in - it was resolved essentially immediately after. Or how >!the sisters can't stand each other, but after a short song they are completely in sync!<. The begining and end felt so brief, but the middle was really long. Don't get me wrong, it was the best part of the movie, but the pacing was really not doing it for me. I also felt that the music was tired and really unremarkable. The songs didn't push the plot forward much and felt like a desperate attempt to reach the top 10 charts. I know it's to be expected at this point, but it still was upsetting to hear. I can't remember a single song - even if you played it to me, I wouldn't be able to tell you it was in the movie.",r0uwz0
hlvfjhj,Bruno is a perfect character,r0uwz0
hm3d5tz,Kinda gets easily overlooked but can we appreciate the fact they actually had people of different skin tones in the family instead of easily making everyone white or the same tone. Accurate for Colombia.,r0uwz0
hn07e8z,Did anyone else feel Pepa (aunty tied to the weather) was a subtle representation of mental illness? It seemed she always had clouds and was battling her anxiety throughout. I quite liked that it wasn't made into a big deal - it was (and is) just part of life.,r0uwz0
hnce0n4,"I realized something while watching this movie and it’s that I’m not a fan of how Disney animated their musical numbers anymore because of how many cutaways they have to something that doesn’t exist. Old Disney movies used to use songs to broaden the world. For example, One Jump Ahead in Aladdin making the streets of Agrabah come alive, A Girl Worth Fighting For from Mulan showing the Chinese countryside and the citizens that the army was protecting. The Circle of Life is probably the best example of this, showing us just how impressive the lions rule over the pride lands is and setting the stage perfectly for the rest of the movie.

Meanwhile, in modern Disney movies half of the songs don’t even take place in the setting they’re being sung in, characters are transported off to mystical dreamscapes where they fall through clouds and interact with metaphorical representations of what they’re singing about. See: You’re Welcome in Moana, Summer in Frozen, and Surface Pressure in Encanto. I dunno, I feel like it makes the world feel more shallow and thin for a few quick gags",r0uwz0
hluxeel,Lin Manuel Miranda's songwriting is so tied to his singing voice that I honestly couldn't listen to any of the songs in this movie without hearing his voice in the back of my head.,r0uwz0
hmrbjc1,"What is happening at Disney? All their films recently feel like messes. Full of great ideas, great characters, beautiful imagery - but meandering stories struggling to link these things together. Is the plot an afterthought in development?",r0uwz0
hlvdztx,"I’m colombian, this movie was amazing. the fact that the family was displaced by violence is not something id ever see in a disney movie. Colombia has been in one conflict or another for like 100 years and most of the books that come out of Colombia are heavily related to that, is unfortunately, a huge part of what Colombia is. 

Also, i felt that the ashes were a reference to Armero, but that might be a stretch. 

Overall I’m severely pleasantly surprised, this was beyond my expectations and we’ll see it a few more times 


My fav song was dos orugas, tho it felt just so relatable because of my recent breakup.",r0uwz0
hlvch43,The grandmother scene where she explains her origins was just heartbreakingly beautiful. Not a dry eye in my theater,r0uwz0
hlyc2k7,i realized: does abuela have a gift? her central role is to act as the leader of the family without any additional assistance of magic guiding everyone else in her influence. if anything then mirabel wasn’t the first one to not be granted a direct power. she as herself is enough to lead others with love - she takes after her grandmother in this regard. her grandmother puts so much of their family’s success squarely on the magic thinking of herself as  not enough to take care of everyone depending on her without the magic. as much as the movie is about mirabel understanding she is enough the grandmother is enough as well. they are both worthy of the love of others without condition.,r0uwz0
hmrc3o6,"This… wasn’t a good movie, it was ok at best.  It looked great, but the story and songs were just all off.  Nobody is going to be singing these songs like any of the 90s Disney classics.",r0uwz0
hlztbps,"It's so beautiful to see my country represented like this, specially the Donkeycorn",r0uwz0
hm4ez1s,"First Luca and now Encanto, Brunos can't catch a break this year. XD",r0uwz0
hnhn5ev,"This is a far more positive discussion thread than I was expecting for a very mediocre film. I don't know, I'm someone that tends to like most Disney offerings but this one just didn't do it for me at all. The pacing was disjointed, the messaging was troublesome for most of the movie, and most egregiously I just didn't feel very connected to the story at all. I think this could have been a more interesting film if it dived more into the family dynamics and fleshed out characters, but they just slid in like a half dozen musical cues instead that just took you completely out of it. The story was pretty bare and there was barely anything explored before wrapping it up with a neat bow at the end. 

Also, Abuela was 100% the antagonist and a stone cold bitch for like 95% of the movie. What a wholly negative character. Yeah, it's sad that your husband died during your escape 30+ years back, but that shouldn't give you free reign to just treat your granddaughter like shit for most of her life. I felt pretty bad for the main character as it seemed like no one was on her side at all until she found her uncle. And for what, the fact that she didn't have a gift? That's so fucking petty and cruel. She didn't have a choice. Also basically ostracizing her son for literal years and just leaving it as is is super fucked. Everyone is trying to placate this old matriarch who just seems to care about the family image and them being perfect rather than just being a kind person. We got so little warmth from her throughout the entire film. The fact that they tried such a hollow resolution to try and redeem her character with a sad flashback at the end felt so cheap and just bothered me. 

I've got a few smaller nitpicks as well. It's strange that they really hand-waved the acquirement of magical abilities from the start and it kept me from being able to buy in at all. Like why are they so special? Did no one else lose a loved one escaping? Is there a reason why they kept getting blessings for multiple generations? You can't just hop right into a musical recap from the jump. Also, there's a whole ass village of people, looks to be multiple generations, who seem to be completely lost without this family holding their hands and solving their issues. Finally those creepy little kids hopped up on caffeine. I think they were going for cute and hyperactive and referencing coffee from Colombia, but it was more off-putting than anything to me. 

I give this like a 3/10. Maybe the weakest Disney affiliated film I've seen in years. Beautiful animation and I'm all for more representation and exploration of cultures, but man was this one a stinker on multiple fronts. Mediocre story and the grandma is a grade-A cunt.",r0uwz0
hm3c9mi,"Pressure to succeed can destroy a family, accept your family for who they are.",r0uwz0
hlv9ejc,"I thought it was great. An immediate ""must buy"".


I also really appreciated how well represented the different skin tones were. I think they've done a good job lately of representing the people that live where these movies take place.",r0uwz0
hluv1az,"Byron Howard and Jared Bush are quickly becoming the new Musker/Clements of Walt Disney Animation Studios IMHO. Byron directed Tangled, both Byron and Bush directed Zootopia, and now they've given us  Encanto. I'll be looking forward to any project where they are at the helm. 

I was a little disappointed by Raya and the Last Dragon, so I had doubts for the next animated Disney flick, but I have to say that I really enjoyed this. 

The songs were very fun and emotional, the humour was on point, the characters were likeable, and the story was well-written. 

I love that Mirabel didn't get a magical power by the end... I feel like a more cliched kids movie would have caved and went with a cheap, overly-happy route for her character.",r0uwz0
hmkjvjd,"So question if Abuela's cutting words to Mirabel were replaced with Abuela hitting Mirabel each time while the whole family did nothing, would Abuela in the end face zero consequences and maintain her social and power status?

Why is emotional abuse considered a less serious and hurtful form of abuse vs. physical abuse?",r0uwz0
hlv4u0h,"I’ve been listening to “Surface Pressure” and “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” nonstop since seeing this. “Waiting for a Miracle” is an interesting take on the usual “I want” song.

Amazing visuals as well. They really played around with the lighting a lot and I loved it.

Good story overall, though I’d guess some folks might have issues with how the miracle works/doesn’t work. Bruno even lampshades the weirdness about the Encanto’s rules. It actually reminded me of a traditional fairytale, where things are magical just because they are.",r0uwz0
hlxunta,"Encanto way better than Raya and the Last Dragon. I know the former was not a musical but Encanto just had better characters and the antagonistic character was not let off easily unlike Raya and the Last Dragon. Encanto harkens back to the Disney animation movies that focuses on a singular character instead of the tag-team of the revival era.

If I had to give any negatives, it's that it features Lin-Manuel Miranda's weakest songs to date. Moana has a way more catchier and emotional soundtrack. Overall, I loved Encanto, go watch it because this movie deserves to do well at the box office.",r0uwz0
hm5tmif,"I know this is a superfluous question but what time period is the movie set in?

My gut instinct was that it had to be 50 years after La Violencia, because that was one of the biggest civil conflicts in Colombia. The family goes to the mountains during La Violencia, and fifty years later the movie starts.

Only La Violencia was during the 1950s, and that would mean that Encanto is set in the 2000s, and it doesn’t really look like it is?",r0uwz0
hpvzrcu,"Am I the only person who feels that the pacing of the movie was quite off? The songs felt out of place, there was a lack of natural flow and it felt like character progression was way too quick and shallow. With how Isabela and Mirabel did not like one another and didn't seem close to them perfectly opening up and mending things perfectly in one song. It all seemed a bit choppy to me and the rap style of the songs was not really my favourite, I didn't feel the emotion.",r0uwz0
hmgbwi1,“He wants 5 babies”. That was unexpected,r0uwz0
hm2vef3,"My theater was full of little Hispanic kids who squealed and cheered when a character spoke or sang in Spanish. When Isabela was introduced, the little girl next to me, maybe 6 or 7, yelled, “That’s MY name!” It made me tear up. This is why representation matters.",r0uwz0
hlvaxs5,"I just loved how the characters *moved* in this movie.  They've done such a good job and made such incredible progress at animating dancing, posture, gait, and body language.  I want to watch it 2 or 3 times again just to enjoy how they move.

Mirabel's character was so lovable and charismatic.  I loved her style and the choices that they made with her look, demeanor, and personality.

I really enjoyed about half of the songs, while some others were a little muddled or the kind of middle-of-the road, ""this is a musical and it's been a while so I guess we should put a song here"" kind of songs.  Definitely could feel LMM's influence/style.

The story was pretty good.  While I loved the reconciliation between Mirabel and Isabela, it happened too quickly and with almost no real effort of genuine apology, empathy, or introspection.  It simply felt like a red-herring plot device to obfuscate that the real conflict was between Mirabel and her Grandma.

Speaking of, Grandma's redemption was also juuustt a little too easy/convenient.  They could have worked on that a little more where you can see her heart change back to cherishing what she has rather than fearing what is lost.

Louisa was so precious.  Loved her ""here's how I feel inside"" song but again, the pressure and burdens that she has had to bear weren't physical -- they were mental, and that wasn't really resolved in the end.  I guess maybe a little -- she got to sit in a hammock there for a bit?  Ok back to work holding this family and community together (physically)!

I was disappointed that Delores and Camila had very little to add to this movie.  Why didn't Delores hear grandma praying for help to save the family near the beginning of the movie? We knew she could have, considering she can hear Louisa's eye twitch and Mirabel's confession to her dad.  Camila was only a changeling used for physical comedy.  We got to know nothing about, and gained no real rapport with this person in the movie, unfortunately.

Antonio's affinity for Mirabel was fantastic.  You could feel the bond between them and the scene where he reached out to her to help walk him to his door was adorable.

I absolutely hate how they brushed off Bruno's return to good graces.  He's been unjustly outcast for years, patching the house together from the inside, longing for his family, and when he finally gets accepted back into the fold, he is brushed aside after a quick hug from Grandma.   He really deserved more.

At the end, I teared up at the family's acknowledgment of Mirabel as she approached the front door.  I would have liked to see it spelled out just a little more for the kids that she really didn't get a gift, why that's okay, and show her acceptance of that a little more clearly.  Good conversation to have with the kids I guess.

Very good movie and will definitely watch it a few more times.",r0uwz0
hm5r5vc,"They kept talking about using their powers to help the community; however, there was clearly an imbalance in how helpful some of them were. Luisa and “healing baked goods mom” seemed to carry the burden. How exactly was super hearing or shape shifting helping the community? And you mean to tell me Poison Ivy could instantly grow crops this whole time, yet she just made flower swings?",r0uwz0
hm7dl7a,"Just watched it! (obs: i didn't watch the movie in English, so please bare with me any mistakes!)

I liked the movie, but i definently feel... whelmed? I expected more mystery surrounding Bruno and more involvement from the rest of the family outside from Maribel, so that was a bit of a let down. 

The songs in Portuguese sounded off (as it has been with the last few Disney musicals when dubbed), and even hard to understand at points, and all i could think was: ""Man... Lin should be singing this.""

Could relate a lot to the Madrigal sisters, and felt lots of anger for Abuela. Really wished we got to see more of the shapeshifting boy (Camilo? I can't remember), Antonio and Bruno!

The ending was, eh? I wished they didn't get the powers and the miracle back, i felt like it undermined the message a bit.

Also, loved how the musical bits were staged, felt very real without missing the whimsical animated feel!

Score: 7,5/10. Not my favorite, still cried the whole movie long.",r0uwz0
hmkxwe5,"Talking about the movie with some people, I see that many left the theater confused about the ending, debating if Mirable got her gift after all, or still wondering about the reason she didn’t get one in the first place. To me, it’s clear that the whole point was she didn’t get a “magical gift” because her purpose didn’t rely on magic, and the source of magic was the union of the family and the community. Abuela, like Mirabel, also didn’t have magical gifts. She was a protector of the candle and was meant to provide a guidance to the family, but with time she had forgotten her purpose and the true meaning of the miracle they were given (and the movie understands her reasons, her fears of losing her home and her loved ones once again). So Mirabel’s gift, by not being granted magical powers, was to continue her grandmother’s legacy in keeping the family together and bringing out the best of its members. She is the glue that keeps the magic alive, which is the most important gift of all.",r0uwz0
hlzhkdk,Was there a short shown before this movie?,r0uwz0
hlzb9y7,"What exactly was the grandma's power? 

Also I'm curious: to Latino, specifically Colombian ones, how much did this film resonate with you?",r0uwz0
hluyyoq,What a visually beautiful movie. I honestly enjoyed every minute of it.,r0uwz0
hmgzzf6,"First off, I really liked the movie. So this is not me saying the movie is bad at all.

But I kinda wish the family *didn't* get their powers back in the end. Casita coming back, sure. But I think it would have been a stronger way of showing that the true gift, the true miracle, was the people and that they could be themselves and thrive even without magic.",r0uwz0
hnhbtf6,"The problem I have with the movie is that in the beginning and the middle of the movie practically everybody tells Mirabel that: ""He lost his way in the family."" or ""You better figure out the prophecy because HE was coming for you!""(Attention: HE and not the future as the whole) And Pepa in ""We don't talk about Bruno"" literally her whole verse was about how BRUNO ruined her wedding. And then when Bruno finally shows up at the end everybody SUDDENLY accepts Bruno and they all are like ""The triplets finally reunited! Yay!"" or ""Yeah! You're part of our family and we love you, and we definitely NEVER feared or hated you. And we were NEVER accusing you of ruining someone's wedding.""
And I was just sitting like:""What the hell? This family are a bunch of hypocrites!"" 
I'm sorry that was just really bugging me. But the rest of the movie I absolutely loved!",r0uwz0
hpvn56t,"Did this feel ahort and rushed to anyone else? Maybe even anti-climatic? It just felt like we got the problem set up at the end of the second act, and the next scene was the resolution, and then it was over.",r0uwz0
hmf72lx,Anyone else wished it was Disney’s Hercules that showed up during surface pressure? Would’ve been a blast if that happened.,r0uwz0
hlutdgq,"Enjoyed this quite a bit. It's colorful, catchy, fairly emotional, and honestly the quality of animation on these things is starting to scare me. 

Wasn't entirely sure what to expect from this movie from the trailer. But there was one thing I was sure of, and that's that the main character would eventually discover her power and it would be the most powerful of all. I was getting Colombian Umbrella Academy vibes. And since I love being surprised, I have to say I was impressed they didn't go that route.

That said, I'm not 100% on how the plot of this wrapped up. They didn't really define the rules of this magic all that specifically. Which is fine, but even after watching I wasn't totally sure why the magic faltered and why it came back. I guess it had something to do with Abuela becoming so obsessed with the powers themselves and how to utilize them that she wasn't appreciating the simple blessing that is your family? So because of that the powers were taken away, and once she learned her lesson they came back? That sounds right but it wasn't totally clear.

That said, I thought the music, the visuals, and the performances and dialogue were just great. The way the house moved and how everyone used their powers gave it a unique feel in a genre that has no shortage of magic. Had a ton of fun with all the songs and their super trippy music videos thanks to the cool power. This Lin Manuel Miranda guy, I think he's gonna be a big star one day. 

I'd probably give this a solid 8/10. Lots of fun, would rewatch, would bump the soundtrack.

Edit: okay so this was the third movie i watched yesterday and I was a bit tired but after some sleep and listening to the soundtrack again it makes much more sense. I was pretty on track, but basically the family was granted the miracle because of how much the grandmother loved and wanted to protect her family. So when she became more obsessed with collecting family members for their powers, like bu forcing marriages or only appreciating her family for what they offer the community, the power started to crack. It seems Maribel was denied power to try and prove a point to Abuela but she refused to listen and only went harder by not appreciating Maribel for what she is. 

I guess I was just thrown because classically Pixar and Disney will clearly define the rules of their magic worlds and then spend the movie breaking them or pushing boundaries. In this movie there aren't so much rules as there are complex family dynamics that are being paralleled by the magic. 

Still really enjoyed this. Loved the way the characters danced and talked and all the types of songs, and especially the visuals. Sticking to my 8/10.

hm880ds,"I really enjoyed this movie. It made me laugh, it made me tear up, I related to Luisa singing about pressure, I loved the songs. I’m a latina in my 30s and I wish this movie had come out when I was a kid, I think it would have been my favorite.",r0uwz0

hm3tang,"I just got back from seeing this with my husband on Thanksgiving. Which is fitting because the reason we even went to the movie theater was because we had no family holiday plans. I knew nothing about this movie going in.. But from the pre movie short onward I cried at least a minimum of five times. 

I am estranged from almost my entire family. I grew up in a dysfunctional family who has huge generational trauma issues that they refuse to acknowledge. Mental health issues run rampant. I think this movie did an exceptional job talking about these issues. The songs were catchy yet quite a few still had emotional weight and showed the different roles people take on in dysfunctional families (the scapegoat, the truth teller, the jokester, the golden child etc.) The colors and the animation were brilliantly eye catching.

I think people who were disappointed by the magic or the way they handled the house falling apart don’t realize that wasn’t really what this film was about. This film was about breaking generational trauma cycles not magic. The magic was just a metaphor for the familial bond and how trauma can be passed down from generation to generation. Mirabel’s gift was that she was a truth teller, and by using it she helped heal her family and herself.",r0uwz0
hm7blkl,"I rewatched the movie in English and it was much better. The songs were better worded and made more sense.

Something I noticed about Mirabel is that she was actually super gifted, she is an amazing seamstress, super athletic, a great dancer, excellent with Children, fantastic listener and proficient with words. She is exceptional but since she doesn't have superpowers she looks plain compare to the rest of the family.",r0uwz0

hmarh34,"I have been sitting with how I feel about the music for the past 4 days and relistening to the album to get a good feel into it and I LOVE the music...Hear me out..

When I was at the movies and heard The Family Madrigal, I turned up my nose at the song and was unimpressed. I thought the singing was off beat and awkward. I thought Surface Pressure was super awkward as well and how it turned hip hop-ish felt out of place even though I know that's LMM shtick.

Saying all of that.... Disney knew what they were doing with the casting choice. To understand the cssting choice is to truly understand Maribel's character and what Disney was aiming for.

Maribel is supposed to be the black sheep. She is just average. She basically was no different from the village people so it is no surprise that she does not sing like a typical Disney princess. Being able to sing like that is a gift and Maribel is supposed to be sans gift. 

I compared her voice to Isabelle who is supposed to be the perfect one and she does have the stronger, Disney-esque voice we are used to. However, I have grown to appreciate Maribel's voice. You can tell she can sing and hold a note but it's not this pitch perfect, clear and clean tone----She's nasally, sometimes a bit pitchy and her voice even cracked one time during Waiting On A Miracle.

I will admit that this is one of the weaker LMM projects but I do find myself playing/singing the songs everyday. These are songs that have to grow on you.",r0uwz0

hlv4cbr,"I came into this movie knowing nothing, but I thought it was really, really good. I think it is especially relatable as someone coming from an immigrant family. The generational trauma of war. Parents who are strict in an attempt to protect their family. The burden of being the eldest daughter who has to shoulder much of the responsibility. The pressure to be perfect, to the point of suppressing your true self and doing things you don’t want for the sake of your family. The self-doubt that comes from having to live up to the achievements of the rest of your family. Literally right before this movie, I had dinner with my friend where we talked about her boyfriend (both Asian as well) and his relationship with his mother and her high expectations and how  “he would never be good enough for her” — a sentiment that was also expressed in this movie. I’m not Latina, but these are all things I’ve seen mirrored in the Asian-American community, and I’m sure many other immigrant communities can also relate.",r0uwz0
hmdfi85,"What a lovely movie! The trailer made it seem like some sort of epic adventure that would take Mirabel into a quest to find the origins of magic, but it’s appropriate to the theme of family bonding and the true meaning of “home” that she doesn’t stray far from the “casita”. This is mostly an internal journey, it’s a story of personal awakening and the stakes are pretty low in comparison to other recent animated films. But this movies knows what it is about, has amazing visuals, a great score and its heart is always in the right place. Loved it!",r0uwz0

hofay7c,"I get everybody loving We Don’t Talk About Bruno and musically it was great but hot damn was Under the Surface perfect.

First off it’s timing in the story was excellent. Up to that point there are signs that things aren’t so great with the rest of the family but it isn’t completely clear that Mirabel isn’t the problem. The song starts with Luisa toeing the family line. She’s fine, family is fine, shut up. But then she just explodes with all the insecurities and lack of personal identity she (and it turns out her whole generation) are feeling, and the course is set for the rest of the movie. 

Lyrically it’s heavy and relatable as hell. I think a lot of us have had to be “the strong one” at times and some of the lines were just sledgehammers to me. 

*The ship doesn’t swerve as it heard how big the iceberg is*

Besides the awesome midline rhyming (I didn’t actually know Manuel wrote the music to this until I heard this song but then immediately recognized him) I can relate to this so much. People making bad decisions, knowing you’ll take the brunt of the impact, because you always have. It’s just what you do. Steering right into the iceberg because hey, Luisa will split it, no worries!

*I’m prеtty sure I’m worthless if I can’t be of sеrvice*

It’s hinted at in the power ceremony but laid bare here: Abuela has the family convinced their only worth is what they can do for the family and community. You get to see it more later. It’s so easy to lose sight of who you even are when you’re spending all your time and energy putting out other people’s fires. Eventually you *need* the fires.

*Give it to your sister and never wonder*
*If the same pressure would’ve pulled you under*

I’m a 33 year old man and this line made me cry. Because damn, again, I’ve been there. Looking at people putting their burdens on me and knowing they’d never be able to handle it. Knowing they don’t even think about it. It’s a terrible, isolating feeling. 

*Was Hercules ever like “Yo, I don’t wanna fight Cerberus”?*

Awesome unexpected reference and I didn’t necessarily personally connect with this line like the others but I thought it was hilarious and needed highlighting. Great delivery too.

I don’t play Disney music in my car much. But I’ve been playing this constantly since I saw the movie.",r0uwz0
hmw7gv4,Why is nobody talking about Waiting on a Miracle? It's one of my favorites in this film even though its short.  I love that one shot of Mirabel in front of the fireworks and love the emotion behind the singing. The lyrics in the beginning flow very well and really capture her pain.,r0uwz0
hlv5krn,"You can definitely hear the signature Lin Manuel Miranda songs. Overall, the movie was great. Has that magical Disney touch. 

Tried to look for Easter Eggs, but I only could think of the Hercules scene (which I’m sure isn’t an Easter egg) and Titanic, which definitely wasn’t an Easter Egg. I thought I might have seen a Coco dog, but not sure. Anyone pick up any on the first viewing?",r0uwz0
hm79z27,"I enjoyed most of the movie, and found many moments heartbreaking and emotional. However, the music was pretty lackluster and I didn’t like how the first song was for exposition. Luisa’s song felt jarring, and ugly compared to the tune of the rest of the movie’s music. I think the characters were pretty shallowly developed, except for Mirabel and Bruno, who I really enjoyed. The abuela and rest of the family had few redeeming qualities, and I did not like the dynamic they chose for the family because it made the resolution feel disingenuous. It kind of felt like they only welcomed Mirabel because they had lost everything, and not because they had learned anything. I wish the movie had gone in a different direction with that. The ending just felt rushed, and combined with shallow characters, it was hard to care for anyone other than Mirabel and Bruno.",r0uwz0

First off the animation was amazing and the songs were fun (though the Lin-Manuel rappy formula might get stale soon I think). 

The voice acting was great and I liked that the protagonist didn't get a power at the end.

On the other hand it's pretty thin story and character wise. I liked the lack of a traditional villain but even at barely 90 minutes it felt like it was stretching itself by the end.

I also thought the opening scene was really weird and annoying. Just ""look we can't be bothered to explain the mechanics upfront so yeah my husband died, there's a candle on the floor for some reason, big magic house outta nowhere, deal with it.""

Obviously they return to this near the end but it just felt like such a frantic messy opening. The mechanics didn't really feel well thought out overall but it's magic, I get it, it's fine.

Stuff like the hearing girl not being able to hear Bruno pissing around despite him being next to the kitchen was weird. I know they have a line where she says she can still hear his voice sometimes but like, you can hear shit miles away and can't hear holmes going to the toilet or sneaking into the kitchen at night? lmao.

Solid 7/10 movie overall, I would much rather Mitchell vs. The Machines win the Best Animated Oscar but I think this probably has it in the bag tbh because it's a much more mainstream-friendly movie.",r0uwz0
hn04o8j,"Can we also talk about what it must be like raising triplets, and when they turn 5, all of a sudden they have powers?! Just triplets alone are a lot. Who helped raise them since their powers give back to the townspeople?",r0uwz0
hp5nxox,"The fact that Bruno was able to see a glimpse of the future with Mirabel and that the house was trying to lead her in the right direction the entire movie towards solving what was wrong tells me that either,

1. The house intentionally did not give her powers to disrupt the status quo of her family. Essentially it turned her into the black sheep of the family to suit the specific purpose of being the harbinger of change in her family. On that same note, maybe it sensed something about Mirabel and thought she would be a good person to pick in order to bring about change in her family.
2. She didn't receive her powers for a separate reason outside of the house's control. Like maybe it was some aspect of the house's weakening power that made it so she didn't get abilities.

The power was inevitably going to dwindle because of the grandma, but did it create a potential positive future for the family by not giving Maribel powers (the harbinger of change I was talking about), or did the future come about inevitably by external forces? 

The fact that her cousin got his powers while she didn't makes me think that the house chose her not to have powers. Also, the fact that it can grant the ability of a person to literally see glimpses of the future as well as a slew of other powers would also imply that the power itself knows about the future to some extent, Kind of like a god-like entity so to speak. 

I personally think the power was aware of the bleak future for the family and chose Maribel not to have powers to create a potential future where the family is saved.

A perfect ending in my opinion would have been Maribel getting her powers at the end of the movie, or at least her own bedroom lol. I know some people are saying that she didn't need the powers, so that's why the house never gave her any, but I don't think anybody in her family by that logic needed powers. The only real necessity would have been the family being saved and the house being created for them, anything else on top of that was extra blessings.

The fact that it didn't include her at least getting her own bedroom kind of disappointed me. She had to take a lot of crap from some of her family the entire movie and was the reason her family's powers and house was saved, so I thought the power could have at least given her some of what the rest of her family was given, especially seeing as how the majority of her family did not have to work for their blessings while Maribel did without actually receiving the same blessings in the end.

Just my thoughts though.",r0uwz0

hqcffu1,"I absolutely adored this movie. Teared up a few times over the course of it. The subtext about family, pride and generational trauma was really well done. Mirabel had it rough: being the only ungifted member of a family that viewed their worth through their gifts would truly be awful. 

Yet, I find her kindness and selflessness in the face of what has to be traumatic to be so endearing. I teared up big time when Mirabel escorts Antonio to his door/gift, all while being watched by Abuela, who is worried that Mirabel will jeopardize the miracle again. 

Pretty much everything Mirabel does is to save her family and home, or to help them to see themselves in the way she sees them. Yes, she's driven for part of the movie in the hopes of receiving a gift, but she never expected it as a likely reward at the end of the journey.

Seeing her get her ""gift"" of her family finally appreciating her and essentially escalating her to the role of Matriarch with the doorknob to Casita was very rewarding, especially on my second watch. 

But if you can't enjoy all that, you've got BOPs like We Don't Talk About Bruno and the absolutely amazing animation to enjoy. Seriously, I think this is the most gorgeous movie Disney has put out yet. The way the characters move, the way their clothes and hair move, to the lighting (especially in Camilo's scene singing as Bruno) is totally amazing 😍

Instead she is trapped with this family and ends up forgiving them and then nothing really changes?  Ugh.  I wonder if this film was  rushed through production - there were some interesting ideas about generational trauma, I loved the color palette, the embroidery details on the clothes, and of all things the capybara.

hm03wfp,"I honestly think the movie would've been more impactful if they didn't get their powers back at the end. The theme of the movie was that you should love your family no matter what. Abuela literally built a mountain to wall off her grief and that in turn poisoned the family, unintentionally, by placing so much on them. Once that wall came down, they no longer need to hide themselves and no longer needed to use their gifts to express who they where.

hmb7oc1,"Thought it was rubbish and half-hearted. The whole thing was under-developed, under-thought, and thematically muddled. I don't think the six credited ""story by"" people actually know why the main protagonist didn't get a power, or what the magic really represents, or why she ought to be treated badly for not having a power, or why she is in any way special (she's not particularly charismatic or anything)... 

What is the story actually about? It is about how it's okay not to have a gift... if so, why did everyone get their gifts back? Is it about how Maribel found her real gift? What is her gift, then? Is it about how she gave Bruno a chance? The movie doesn't really draw on that. It just didn't commit to anything. The songs were also lifeless; and the singing, like the plot, was muddy and poorly enunciated. 

Frustratingly, there were glimpses of what could have been. I liked the very very opening (before the tedious, overlong song which just repeats the same information), and the gift celebration scene, and the scene in Bruno's tower... but too much of it was unfocused and uncommitted.",r0uwz0

hq2zzw2,"Whilst I loved the movies visual and musical style. Luisa and Bruno were fucking amazing.

I still have a major irk about its themes, especially the movies notions about ""family"". Central to all this is Abuela Alma. 

I am a person that grew up in a family that loved me, there were issues, some honestly lightly abusive but most of my experiences comes from a close family member whose parents were narcissists and friends who have shitty parents and one of the most recurring themes seems to be this use of ""family"" and familial love to justify shitty behaviour. 

There is this idea of owing your family something and if you go against it no matter how harmful it ""breaks it"" and you are seen as being at fault. In Encanto this bond is literally symbolized by the magic where somehow everyone gets powers as long as the family is together. Which obviously leaves Mirabel as responsible and a threat to the entire family despite obviously being the second black sheep of the family.

Alma suffered some horrendous trauma in her youth which unsurprisingly left her scarred and she have issues she needs to overcome. This leads her to a life of having a very strict view of how the family must ""come first"" and everything needs to be for ""the familys sake"". The magic is her last connection to her husband and it saved them.

But instead of treating any of her children like individuals she scolds them and forcibly steer them onto paths that need to help society and the village. She loves the fact that ""her family"" is special and that she gets to be the head of it. 

Enter Mirabel, the first one to not get magic. Almost as if the magic notices the abuse. As some say her ""power"" is meant to heal a family that is becoming stagnant and locked in their way by not giving her a power. This leads to her being alienated and treated as less for the entirety of her life. (The theme especially to me struck hard having thought before about how painful it must be to have special family members and not having those traits yourself, for example Steven Universe with the gems etc.)

Alma is horrified by Mirabel because she is a threat to her stability. Suddenly not having the power and being able to help the ""families"" prestige together with the risk that the next child might not get powers frightens her. The whole ideal about the families next generation potentially being powerless seems to be horrific. The movie constantly put forth how special the family is and yes they have pressure on them despite the powers they still are in a situation were they are ""different"" in a way that makes them fundamentally ""above"" other people. 

Over the course of the movie we get to see the other family members and their pressures. How everyone looks to Alma for appreciation and want to be good enough so they do their best for ""the family"" never caring about their own lives and being afraid to protest. Alma especially keeps the family close and reinforces the whole thing by bringing up how everything NEEDS to be perfect. Always seeing Mirabel as the issue. She drove away Bruno not by actually saying or doing anything but by putting the pressure out there were he didn't feel like he could be part of the family because his powers weren't beneficial. To me it indicates there were times were Alma and/or other family members brought this up which lead to all this.

Alma towards the end apologizes to Mirabel shortly after accusing her of destroying the family and causing the magic to die out.

Then in the end we get to see Alma's suffering or Mirabel does and somehow gets the feeling that it has justified what Alma did so Mirabel apologizes to her. Somehow this together with mending the family brings back magic and everything which gives the message that if Mirabel doesn't reconcile the rest won't get their powers back and magic will die. It guilt trips Mirabel who obviously wants to help her family to reconcile. 

I am not against reconcilliation please don't get me wrong but Mirabel deserved so much better. Her family treated her like shit. She like most of us were born without powers and Alma, the family head treated her the worst. Yes all of the people with power deserve sympathy. Especially Bruno but the movie seems to always put it forth how horrible it is for them over Mirabel. Its Mirabel who somehow has to fix every issue the family has despite never being treated fairly herself. And in the end she barely gets an apology whilst having to apology herself to ""give the super powers back"" to her family.

I could probably write better and such but I really just don't like this theme that the victim needs to apologize and fix a families issues. It feels like the families behaviour is never actually put to trial. Especially the treatment of Bruno.",r0uwz0
hma4wac,"Saw it last night and I was...whelmed.  the animation was very good, especially the scene with Abuela by the river.  

But the story itself was tepid and uninspired: families have disagreements and you need to hug it out.  Meh, OK. It seemed like there was never any *real* drama or danger to the family.

And that's ignoring a really important part about the family: *they are not nice people.*  They ostracized Bruno, they exclude and belittle Mirabella, and they only start being nice to them at the very end...and suddenly everything is OK.

It felt a lot like a half-hearted mashup of Frozen and Coco, but without any of the wow factors those movies delivered.

The music was not very good. The opening 5 minutes of exposition got pretty boring pretty quickly, especially when it started repeating itself.  Luisa's song sounded straight out of Hamilton, but by someone who couldn't sing.  I can barely remember the other songs

The one point of criticism I really have, is that I think Luisa's potential was a bit wasted.

During the movie we got to know about her insecurities, and that she feels herself lost if she doesn't have her Super-Strength ability.

I wish we got a scene, where after Luisa lost her power, she'd use her natural strength to accomplish a feat, showing that she doesn't need her ability to be who she is, and is still capable of performing similar tasks. Even if it's just something simple, like protecting Mirabel from something heavy. Or throwing her to reach a high place.",r0uwz0

hqfos2d,"I think this is my favourite Disney film of all time and I grew up in what some call the golden era for musical Disney films.

I'm a straight white guy from Scotland and not a single ounce of Latino culture in me or around in my life but this film hit me hard... And I can't explain why it did 


The amount of times I had tears in my eyes watching the film was unbelievable considering I just don't cry 

Even now anytime ""Dos Oruguitas"" comes on and it hits the Mairposa part in the song I burst into tears.

I think this film will go down as a generational hit like inside out did.
Inside out dealt with teaching kids emotions the basic emotions and I feel this film will teach kids alot more of the struggles of life and how family pressure is there but at the end of the day your family will always be there for you if you all open up and speak about it all.

hqnhhfp,"i just came here to say that the whole scene of ""we don't talk about bruno"" is a cinematic MASTERPIECE and this movie doesn't get some sort of technical award for it, i will be personaly offended.

I loved the movie in general. A couple of the songs are stuck in  my head a week later (bruno no no no). I knew generally what it was about but i didn't expect it to hit me on such a personal level. I'm not even colombian. But the family dinamics are very similar to my experience and it was a bittersweet watch.

But the LIGHTING of the scenes of the song, when it's raining and they're dancing in front of the church. It blows my mind that they were able to replicate that very specific light when the sky is cloudy and it's dim and about to rain, but you can tell that behind the clouds the sun is shining. It looks amazing on their white clothes. And they made that with MATH. 

It's one of those moments when you realize, humans are amazing. We are able to take something that looks magical and ethereal and study it until we can replicate it. WITH MATH. I know it probably sounds stupid to be so hyped about something so specific, but in this shitty world, I relish this feeling of being in awe of something good. So whoever the lighting engineers were in this movie: thank you. I really really enjoyed your work.",r0uwz0
hqo8pq4,"The movie was so beautiful visually, but the later half of the movie was such a mess, narratively. The ending was unsatisfying and it really looked like they came up with ""scenes"" they wanted to put in the film before they had even thought about how to end it or where they wanted it to go. As a result, it comes across as ""parched up"" and the pacing suffers greatly.

The characters were charismatic but barely studied at all. Mirabelle's sisters where by far the most interesting characters in the movie (and Abuela), but we barely get to know their struggles at all. Like with its themes, in my opinion, the characters suffer from a severe lack of depth, because the movie just doesn't take time to explore them, and as a result the resolution feels underwhelming and undeserving. You can't try to aim for these grand motives and themes without devoting time to actually develop them properly. Or, well, you can, but then you end up with something like this, and it's just not it.

The spaces where also annoyingly vague and undefined. All action us developed inside the house, but the way the spaces are presented are chaotic and inconsistent, reminding me of Inside Out with it's chaotic worldbuilding that just doesn't allow for an immersive experience.

The music was okay I guess, the first number was not good at all imo, Bruno's was great. This might be just that I watched the Spanish dub and it sucked though, the English voice acting is much better from what I've seen on YouTube. Complete opposite to Coco, if I may draw the comparison, where the Spanish dub is miles better than the original English imo.

In any case, one of my biggest issues with the movie is that it doesn't know how to ""show don't tell"". Half of the family cast could be toss aside and not included in the family and the movie wouldn't change at all, which is sad because of how vibrant they are, as a concept. The execution is poor though, which makes me sad.

Like focus on Abuela, showing an Up-style opening that's like a mini movie of her youth meeting Abuelo and showing the circumstances of her fleeing her home with her three babies and building the casita, then have her as the main character of the movie, going around fearing for the house that's crumbling, talking to everyone one by one, ending with Mirabel helping her see it's the pressure that's making everyone crack, and reconciling her with Bruno better. That would be really original if it focussed on the oldest member and the twist was that she realized she's the antagonist herself. Or if they really had to focus on Mirabel because they wanted to sell her as a quasi Disney princess then I would still have liked to see things done a bit differently. Like I thought it was weird that she didn't get along with any of her siblings or cousins her age. Why isn't she best friends with Dolores or Luisa? I just found it weird that she didn't have a friend in her family.

The other thing is I find the details kind of sloppy! Given the time period and country it's placed in, shouldn't Abuela be carrying the babies in a blanket on her back? Especially if they are walking for more than just a few seconds? She's seen just carrying three babies in her arms and not using any baby-carrying trick??? That's just not how humans exist! And then there's the fact that a pregnant woman in the late 1800s was able to know she was carrying triplets? Or the fact that Bruno is in possession of a phonograph record player even though the movie is set in the early 1900s?

Plus the story was low stakes. Not the generational trauma of the Abuela and the burden of having useful gifts, that was enough stakes, but I mean the plot around it was low stakes. I was never worried that the family was in danger because even if they lost the house and the magic, they'd still be... perfectly fine? The whole time I just felt there was no danger and no obstacles. Like what does Mirabel have to do in the new vision? Cue dramatic music and mysterious reveal... She has to hug Isabella. That doesn't seem very difficult! Or the big tension over the dinner scene because Mirabel is scared that Dolores will reveal her secret that she went into Bruno's tower to look for a vision... But I kept thinking even if Abuela learns that she did that, nothing will happen. She's not going to banish Mirabel. It was just tension over nothing and it wasn't even funny.

And finally, this movie really makes me appreciate the colossal work that Auli'i Cravalho did on Moana. She was just 15 and she did better voice work and much better singing than the established actress they hired to play Mirabel. Stephanie Beatriz, try as she may, does not sound 15 and doesn't seem to be a singer. I don't understand why they hired her. It's like they couldn't find good Latino actors, but considering they were able to find a Hawaiian teen of such talent, and considering there are way more Latinos in the US and the world, I think they definitely could have found someone right for the role if they tried. So I don't know what happened, maybe someone wanted to hire their friends, but none of the voice cast seems to be particularly good singers. Anyway, this really made me appreciate Auli'i Cravalho's colossal work. Just listen to her Moana songs and appreciate how good she was! The Encanto cast was so weak they had to bring in Carlos Vives and Sebastian Yatra to give the movie some legitimacy. The Sebastian Yatra song is by far the best scene in the movie.",r0uwz0

hmd0vbd,"The animation was great, the characters lovable, but I don’t know about the story. Yes you don’t need a gift to be important, but if everyone else gets one, it does create implications. Why not Mirabel? The magic has shown it can consistently give everyone a gift, so what does it say about Mirabel that it suddenly said, “Mm, nope”, with her? Why did the magic subject her to the rejection and insecurity that came with that? The message that she doesn’t need one is overshadowed by the apparent cruelty of the situation. The magic started out as this blessing that righted a great wrong, giving everything to someone who lost everything- but now, it appears the magic is the one doing the injustice. The house makes everyone a door and special room, and when Mirabel isn’t given one, it heavily reads like Mirabel is being told she’s unwelcome. The house *literally* doesn’t have room for her. It’s confusing and left me feeling frustrated for her. The way her door fades into dust and she just looks so broken and confused…it was gut wrenching, and so unfair. Mirabel was just a little girl, being told by a magical entity in front of her entire town that she wasn’t special, that there was no space for her. And we never find out why. And because of it, her family neglected and emotionally abused her for years. That isn’t okay. So in this situation, it *isn’t* okay that she didn’t get a gift. She might not need one, but it’s still not okay. 

Other commenters have said that it’s because Mirabel is abuela’s successor, she’s the steward of the magic and the future leader of the family. However, if this is the case, I think they could have shown that much more clearly. It’s critical the audience clearly receives that message when the alternative is the viewer thinking the movie is about a magical force rejecting a kind and loving child for no reason. And regardless, I don’t love that message either. To me it says that the magic gives everyone else fun superpowers, but chooses Mirabel to be the sacrificial lamb who gets no gift, no place in the house, and the full burden of being everyone else’s therapist- “everyone” being the people who bullied and rejected her for something she had no control over. That message feels…awful. 

For entertainment’s sake, I suppose the movie was cute. I loved how colorful it was and the exploration of Colombia and its culture was refreshing. But I can’t get past the treatment of Mirabel. I just wanted to give her a hug and take her away from that cold, thankless place.",r0uwz0
hmkia7j,"If Alma had physically abused her family members would it be so easily brushed off in the end? I find that emotional abuse isn't taken nearly as seriously as physical abuse.

The family not talking about Bruno and Bruno getting rejected is a severe form of emotional abuse that can be even worse than physical abuse. Isolation is brutal.

But in the end Alma realizes what's happened and there are zero repercussions for her in the family because...family. 

Is the message that there shouldn't be any consequences given to emotionally abusive individuals within a family?",r0uwz0
hqc9xm0,"Ok, I lovedddd Luisa and her musical number, but really didn’t like how they portrayed her finally embracing her bottled up emotions. I mean come on, she’s held all this in for years and now she finally gets to let it all out (sending a good message)  and they make her seem like an emotionally unstable person who is always crying and having a mental break down (bad message).

hr2264v,"Small details: 
Anyone else notice in Bruno’s sand cave there are a bunch of carvings that look like he’s shrugging. He can see but he doesn’t understand what he sees. That’s what I’m thinking.

I had to read a book in therapy called Adult Children: The Secret of Dysfunctional Families by John and Linda Friel. 
There are types of children in these families that play a specific role…roles you can see in Encanto
The Do-er- Luisa;
The Helper/Lover- Julieta;
The Lost child/Loner- Bruno;
The Hero- Isabel;
The Mascot- Antonio;
The Scapegoat- Mirabel;
It matches up so perfectly!

At the end, when Abuela goes and apologizes, it goes through what parents are supposed to do when they hurt their children: apologize, rebuild the relationship (house), move forward. 

The nuances get me.",r0uwz0
hr3qfjy,"I felt like they missed some great opportunities in this movie. I love the movie and the premise, but man they could have expanded on Antonio and his being able to talk to animals.

hmwi1ru,"i just saw this movie today. i was MASSIVELY disappointed. i am so upset with how sloppily written this movie is! the pacing was too fast. a lot of the characters, concepts, and plot are underdeveloped and left unexplained or unexplored to its fullest potential. it's just so sad that this movie was written by the same guy who did moana and zootopia, both of which are way more sound and better fleshed out than encanto...but then the other writer also wrote raya and the last dragon, so i guess that explains why encanto failed so much. both raya and encanto suffer from horrible story pacing. it doesn't help that the fast paced songs by lin manuel miranda make it even harder to catch up to what's happening. the exposition via song hinders the opening of the film too. and this is coming from someone who LOVES lin manuel miranda's work! i loved vivo! and might i say, VIVO is even better than encanto too!

i am just deeply saddened and disappointed with how much this movie has let me down...also the ending doesn't give a good message either. i wish for so many things to be different that could have improved the story at its core...but as it is, encanto is sadly average and just so badly paced and underdevelped. it's almost frozen 2 levels of underdeveloped and rushed if we're being honest...biggest disappointment from disney for me to date. i'd give it an average score like 5 or 5.5 out of 10.",r0uwz0
hm6lwc8,"Honestly was not a big fan. The songs felt weak and I was a little disappointed in how little some of the characters were used (transformation guy felt like he was just there for gags, and the little kid pulled a complete 180 on his character after he got his powers). Will say it was pretty, really fit the setting of Colombia well, and I liked the lead, though I felt from the ads there'd be a bit more of a journey going on instead of just staying in the house.

Wasn't terrible, though, I'd give it a 7/10 for me.",r0uwz0
hmijo86,"I have waited months for this movie and was very excited to see it….however, I was less than thrilled by the end of it.

First the positives: Beautiful animation. Gorgeous colors. I love how they incorporated the use of magic into the storyline. My children watch a lot of animes and got excited hearing the gifts being referred to as “quirks.” 

Negatives: The story had a few plot holes. Yes, I know it’s an animated movie but someone explain to me (in case I missed it) how Dolores with her supersonic hearing missed the fact that her uncle was still living in the house. 
Also, Lin Manuel Miranda needs to be stopped at all costs. The music (beats, pacing, lyrical delivery) was incredibly lazy. Every piece of work he has done sounds just like the last thing he has done. 
Additionally, there were too many (yes I said too many) songs and most of them weren’t good.",r0uwz0

hsscqck,"I have a theory. Shit I think about when trying to go to sleep and listening to ""We don't talk about Bruno"" at least 7 times throughout the day. I think I know what Mirabel's power was: Altering Bruno's prophecies/altering the future.

What makes me say that is a couple of things:

1. Bruno's prophecy about her in the first place was the only one (shown) that had two outcomes, and it happened to be the one that she was specifically featured it. She was the deciding factor between the house/family crumbling, or being saved.
2. Dolores' prophecy was that she wasn't going to get to be with or marry Mariano due to him getting engaged with Isabela - again, because of Mirabel's ""interference"", the engagement was called off and Dolores ended up with him in the end.
3. Isabel's prophecy indicated she was going to get everything in life that ""*she""* wanted*,* which, if you've watched the movie, you realize she didn't actually want any of that and was being forced into that ""perfect life"" by Abuela. Again, Mirabel changed the course of her life.
4. Bruno's ""re-done"" prophecy. She was with him when he used his powers to make a new prophecy, but since she was there that time, she could see the butterfly - something that could change the outcome of it all.",r0uwz0
ht0dfit,"I don’t know. 

I wanted to love this but it just didn’t pull together. I don’t know what ending I was hoping for, but I definitely didn’t feel like the payoff was worth the movie. I’ll watch it again because my kids enjoyed it and maybe I’ll change my opinion, but for now I’m disappointed. Grandma’s a bitch and didn’t earn Bruno or Mirabel’s forgiveness. And I don’t really understand why they have this magic. If it’s all some sort of big metaphor, I don’t really get it. Grandma was one of many escaping, did grandpa sacrificing himself grant that one family eternal awesomeness? I don’t know. I had heard that this was the next Coco and couldn’t disagree more.",r0uwz0

I'm not being a contrarian, I honestly thought the comments section here would tear this movie apart for being so boring, hamfisted and lacking any real substance.

Like with Luisa’s song I was like “another song already?” “We just finished one” and when it was over I was like “okay that was unnecessary and could’ve been a conversation”. And the “we don’t talk about Bruno” song as well imo. 

Like I still think on how frozen could’ve done without two or three songs, for more story, with one of them being the song sung by them trolls. That was totally unnecessary but oh well.",r0uwz0
hqw9xcs,"So every person in the family had a “superpower” that was really a coping mechanism for being in a dysfunctional family 

Bruno- He tells the truth about what is happening and is the black sheep and scapegoat of the family because he doesn’t tell people what they want to hear

Isabela- The Golden child, held to impossible standards and fawned upon when she does what Abuela wants of her

Luisa- The sibling who feels inferior to the golden child and thinks it’s her sole responsibility to hold the family together at the expense of her own wants because caring for others defines her 

Pepa- stormy mental illness due to her estranged brother and narcissistic mother- also blaming Bruno for her wedding storm which is a metaphor for her losing her temper and needing a scapegoat on a stressful day 

Antonio- Young child uses his imagination to talk to animals as a form of escapism from a dysfunctional multi generational household 

Camilo- “born to entertain” and mimics those around him to please them and to keep them happy with him, literally a social chameleon 

Dolores- Hypervigilent because of the family dysfunction- listens to everyone around her without trying and always on edge 

Julieta- Coping through adherence to strict gender norms, uses food to convey love and to keep people happy, cooking is her only skill and she’s defined by it

Mirabel- Trying to break generational trauma, blames herself at first just for asking questions and wanting people to be genuine with her 

Abuela- narcissist who has deep trauma and projects a need for control to her family because she never wants to feel out of control again",r0uwz0

Abuelas power/miracle was transforming her her normal candle into a talisman in her time of great distresses when she saw her husband struck down not necessarily dead.
and from there creating the house and bestowing the gift power/miracles of their own  to her family.
Mira never got a door in house ver 1 for unknown reasons.
but even as kid her family connection/house connection was strong she seems to be the only one besides Abuelu who communicates with the house regularly.
I think Mirablr inherited her grand mothers family based magic hence support only.
and normal other wise.
and when she and abuela tension grew so did the cracks since bothe have family bonds based power their emotions and relationship afffected the house.
similar to peps weather control.
that’s why mira bell was able to restore the home magic.

All of the pictures on the doorways were of them as adults even when they were all five years old. Except for Antonio. He was shown as he was in the present on his door. So one of the users was asking why this was, and the director said that he wouldn't answer to keep a bit of the magic secret. 

But I thought it was a reflection of Abuela Alma's desires. She already had a plan for herself and her children and grandchildren. So the house mapped out their entire lives into their teenage years/adulthood. Knowing that at some point after adulthood Mirabel would change their course, so it didn't know what they looked like after that. Almost like the house has the ability to look into the future like Bruno, or that it exists at all times in the past, present, and future. But can't look into the future anymore after the house is destroyed and rebuilt because now Mirabel has changed the course of the lives of the family. It is no longer Alma's vision of the future, but Mirabel's. 

So Mirabel already affected the magic with Antonio. She knew that animals were his favorite thing. The gift she gave him had all of the animals that came to him during the ceremony drawn on the box. That was her wish and desire. For Antonio to be himself, so therefore the house mapped him out as his five year old self, so that he could grow, and become whatever he wants. 

You even hear Abuela say to Antonio, we'll figure something out with how your gift can help the village. She clearly wasn't prepared for his gift to be something she didn't already think of. So she had no clue what to do with his gift and how to apply it to the village. So he was just able to enjoy his gift for himself. 

I doubt I'm correct, but I just thought it was interesting to speculate on why the doors were like that.",r0uwz0

Just the fact that you are half alive and feel that if you so much relax for a bit you will lose even more despite having already lost a lot. The fear that you MUST stay strong for your family because otherwise life will happen and life will once again take from you. While experiencing such a trauma will def hurt your kids and remaining family like we see in the movie, I feel that the movie could be way more powerful by giving Abuela a more nuanced character arc.

htxnocu,"full spoilers ahead:

&#x200B;

just watched it and I think Mirabel got a power like everyone else: The power to turn magic around her off (and on).

&#x200B;

As we can see when Antonio got his gift, getting their magic power happens when they are about to touch the door, then magic happens and the door changes to represent its power.

&#x200B;

Soooo back to Mirabel, her door got erased and that's not because she was denied her gift/magic, but as a representation of her magic, which is, she can switch magic off (and on again). But since the candle never explains a power, for the whole family it looked like Mirabel got denied her magic power.

Furthermore we learn that emotions directly influence their magic powers when Julieta gets angry at Mirabel and creates her first ever cactus, where she directly mentioned it and when Luisa has too much emotional stress on literally her shoulders as everyone has high expectations from her and her magic power.

so... back to Mirabel. The first time the house is cracking is when the family is taking a picture on Antonios day without her, which makes her sad, she gets outside, subconsciously activates her power and the house starts cracking. Luisa later even mentioned that she felt her strength weakening during that time.

The 2nd time the house is cracking is after the whole family learned about Bruno's vision he made about her. Again, big emotional stress on her, making her subconsciously use her power to weaken all magic around her. Then she goes into Julieta's room, they get friends and have a hug, which makes Mirabel happy and the house heals ""itself"". By which i mean Mirabel - again subconsciously - activates her power to bring back the magic around her, which ultimately gets ruined by Abuela Alma showing up, being really angry and Mirabel loosing it at which point she subconsciously shuts down all magic around her.

Then they rebuild the house from scratch and without any magic, for Mirabel to place in the doorknob which seemed to restore the magic randomly, or with the power of friendship and love or whatever. But in (my) reality, Maribel - once again subconsciously - reactivates all magic around her.",r0uwz0

hwqfutt,"I’m sorry, and I know I’m probably in the minority here, but this was just a standard good Disney movie for me and I’m not understanding the hype. Not that it’s bad in any sense it’s overall a good story, I’ll just bullet point:

- The Bruno song….it’s popularity surprises me. Maybe a single line like “we don’t talk about Bruno” sticks in the head, but not the whole damn song like “let it go” and other Disney songs have

- at this stage we know Disney/Pixar animates amazingly beautiful so that’s not really something I praise Disney/Pixar movies for anymore; more so it’s noticing if things don’t looks good; but no this movie had beautiful animation, but nothing ground breaking 

- I’m not Columbian so I can’t say whether it did the culture justice, I’m assuming it did though

- this movie, Luca, onward all seem on the same level for me

- this seemed to be a mix of elements from previous Disney/Pixar films (you got mysticism of tangled, lame duck/mortal protagonist of frozen)

- Moana was better",r0uwz0
hr1otvp,"I feel like I’m the only one who really didn’t like this movie. The visuals and premise were fantastic, and I thought each individual scene was pretty good. But the scenes just didn’t flow together. Basically, my biggest issue is that the movie had a billion unrelated plots going on at the same time so it felt very messy.

So first, there’s the subplot where Mirabel doesn’t have powers. I liked this, even though it’s a very classic “I’m not like my family” Disney plot. I just don’t think this plot was resolved well. Like Mirabel brought everyone together in the end, but it honestly wasn’t really any choice she made that helped. The grandma felt better after monologuing and pretty much coming to a conclusion on her own. Mirabel accidentally finds Bruno, and he talks to her and eventually realizes he wants to re-join the family on their own. Mirabel doesn’t say anything to her sisters that helps them understand the pressure of their powers, they just tell her. So Mirabel spends most of the movie just getting talked at, and she doesn’t actually do anything. That makes the ending very unsatisfying. Mirabel was the gift and that’s her “power?” But she literally did not do anything. I just wish she had more agency in actually changing the family, because I feel like everyone else just came to their own conclusion sans Mirabel. 

Mirabel also wants to “save the magic,” but she doesn’t really do anything for that. Firstly, most of the movie was spent with Mirabel wanting to save magic but not knowing how, so it felt very disorganized. Mirabel didn’t have a path to follow, so the audience can’t really support her, and she can’t really make any major decisions. And when the plot does progress, it doesn’t actually do anything. The vision says that magic will either be destroyed or preserved. That’s the two options, I guess? It really didn’t tell us anything or even set us on a path that could lead to something. Then, Mirabel learns that she needs to hug Isabel, and she does, and nothing happens. We don’t even really see them as close sisters because they don’t interact for the rest of the movie, so it isn’t like Mirabel is saving magic by gluing the family together. Then Mirabel destroys the magic and immediately brings it back. So it just feels like nothing has changed from the beginning of the movie. This plot really didn’t progress in a meaningful way, and it was muddled by the other subplots, which I’ll get to next. 

The next subplot is the characters who feel burdened by their powers. I think this was supposed to tie into the whole “grandma puts too much pressure on them,” but the songs made it clear that the girls felt pressure from EVERYONE. Not just their grandma. If the movie wanted to send the message that these powers were a burden, I don’t think they needed two songs. They could have had one song where ALL the side characters talk about the burden of their powers and it would have been more cohesive. And this plot line didn’t wrap up very well because the girls still had their powers and expectations at the end of the movie. For example, Louisa is moving around and helping rebuild when she’s strong again at the end of the movie, so she’s still very much shoehorned into the same role. I really couldn’t identify the message Disney wanted to send with this subplot.

Then you also have the plot about the grandma being emotionally abusive. Like I said, the other characters talked about the pressure of expectations from everyone, not just the grandma, so the idea that the grandma was unfair to everyone kinda falls flat. But she was definitely mean to Mirabel. But...considering that the climax of the film involves them coming together, I think the relationship between Mirabel and her grandmother should have been more developed. We get a few instances of the grandmother brushing Mirabel off, excluding her, or being mean, but there’s not a lot of direct conflict. And we don’t really know how Mirabel feels about her grandmother other than she wishes she had powers so she could impress everyone. But if your climax centers on solving tensions in a relationship, that relationship should be at the forefront of the movie instead of one of many, many subplots.

There were other subplots, like the idea of using your powers to help your community, the whole thing with Bruno, the way Antonio is hyped up then basically forgotten. I honestly could not summarize the plot of the movie because it made no sense and there really wasn’t one.

This concept was amazing, and I think if the movie was a bit more focused, it would have been better. But it’s not, so it’s just a jumbled mess. It’s very reminiscent of Frozen 2 in that way. 

I know this is a long rant, but I was actually really disappointed with this movie and I was surprised to hear how positively most people view it. So I wanted to put this out here and see your guys’s thoughts.",r0uwz0
hm4evja,"I don't understand the haters' complaints of abuela. Her behaviour makes sense if you had paid attention to her flashback and the temporary consequences were shown. She said sorry to mirabel.

I don't need 6 fucking hours of abuela begging on her knees for forgiveness. Why does nostalgic bait like Ghostbusters afterlife get a pass yet this gets criticized for daring to have a complex character.",r0uwz0
hluvt2q,"Overall I did like it quite a bit. The music was decent. Not great, but pretty good. There are some good funny moments and some emotional and moving moments. The animation, as always it is from Disney, was top notch. The house did ooze the Disney magic that makes Disney films so unique.

However my main problem is actually the Madrigals. The whole movie I kept wondering why Maribel doesn't just leave this family. They are very emotionally abusive, particularly the grandmother. Then there is Bruno. I loved Bruno, but really disliked how the film dealt with his character in the end. How the family treated him and did to him was not ok and it was just completely brushed off at the end. That left a bad taste in my mouth.

Still the film was good overall. I had fun. But I did have issues with certain elements of the story and the characters. 7/10",r0uwz0
hm3sa8n,"Surprisingly mixed emotions. My main complaint is the conflict and its resolution (and the message it’s intending for kids). I’m usually more lenient on harsh parents but Jesus, this was easily the meanest Disney parent since Buck Cluck. The fallout felt deserved, but then hugging and making up with a sad backstory felt flat for me. The flashback scene works better than most of the movie tbh

6/10, better than Moana but dang, this was a disappointment besides the songs.

Edit: also my theater did not like it. One kid was clanging a can during the serious parts and I heard multiple people getting their coats towards the end.",r0uwz0
hmckeom,"I’m going to be honest, to me it was about a 7/10. The grandmother was awful, and we were just supposed to forgive her, and the magic coming back at the end I feel invalidated the entire story. There was also just nothing that really grabbed me.",r0uwz0
hqsnwsw,"I just came here to complain and had to sort by controversial to see any real opinions, I don't believe so many people liked it. 

As I watched it, well I tuned out at the very first song introducing us to like 20 characters while I could barely understand the lyrics but supposedly they're a very awesome family..
nah I knew I wasn't feeling it.
However I continued watching and the movie didn't do the proper steps to make me care about the protagonist or her gigantic family.

They should have chosen a few characters and make the movie about them. Like, is the little kid in her room going to be our co-protagonist? Not really. He gets this big scene about getting his own gift and that's it. Mind you, he's introduced just for that so I didn't previously care for him.
Then there's some big musical about her being sad and.... next is the big sister / aunt? The one with Super strength gets her own musical.
Oh, so she'll be the other protagonist and go on an adventure with our MC? Brains and brawn?

Well no, THAT was Luisa's spotlight, goodbye, next time is the turn of some other family member. It's a little collection of scenes and none of them are truly part of the story... no, at that point I realize, there IS no story. 
It's just goofing around with musicals from one family member to another.
Even Bruno who seems to be important is just in for a little while.

And at the end, it's the grandma turn to sing and the movie ends. Awesome.",r0uwz0

hm2c0t6,"Was the only one in the theatre. Laughed here and there, enjoyed it, overall did not love it. Most of the songs were very average, most of the cast sadly sounded average with some exceptions (great VA but not great singing.) 
Love everything Disney and watched this at the premiere but it was overall extremely forgettable, just stunning visuals. The whole big reveal was that there is no goddamn reveal and the reasoning behind everything happening was ... unremarkable. Weakest Disney release since Tangled, sadly.
Overall, what would have improved it significantly imo was if Mirabella's gift was countering magic, it made so much sense with the door dissolving shortly after she touched it, the cracks bursting from around her and Bruno's room collapsing with her in. Would have been much more interesting but oh well.",r0uwz0
hqe2hdx,"The music's amazing, the design is beautiful, the Latin culture is vibrant and tangible... the movie is horrible.

hmsu60z,"I really liked this movie, and I haven't been a fan of a few Pixar/Disney films recently. The visuals/rendering were also mindblowing. Ignoring the aesthetic comparisons (which are subjective), the quality of the 3D was even better than Coco, which is really impressive. The technology is so next generation.

**Some criticisms and thoughts, for fun.**

1. I thought it was weird that Mirabelle's prophecy/vision only showed her reconciling with one sister. At first I thought that'd be ridiculous (being so small and specific in scope), before I quickly realized it surely must mean she needs to restore relations between the entire family. But I feel like that ""journey"" of repair/reconnection could have been more profound and taken up more of the movie. I feel like the vision could keep getting refreshed showing more cracks/people in the family that need to be resolved in order to restore the power. It sort of leapt from the sister to the abuelita really quickly and then had to end.
2. I did not like how they got their powers back in the end. It felt very ""simple Disney"" to the point of being a bad look. The whole point should be that they've redefined themselves as humans & family members, not as facades for their superpowers. It also felt a little weird watching the whole community rally to rebuild this massive mansion for this family who only just got their shit together, and then they get their powers back anyway. Having them end up as a happy functioning family even with a massive mansion ""casita"" with no powers would still be a perfectly bow-tied ending.
3. Some of the powers felt kind of random from a storytelling perspective. Like the ability to snoop/hear everything, or being a walking weather cloud (which is funny, but more of a comedic device than anything meaningful). I think they should have taken core defining characteristics of a family (strength, unity, compassion, whatever) and atomized those into special powers, where only each person manifests one of those traits as a conventional power. Then having them all come together at the end would make even more thematic sense and have a great payoff.",r0uwz0
hslbszs,"The word that defines it for me is: unearned. The emotional beats of the story feel unearned, because they spend no time developing them and 90 percent of character development in this movie takes place in 1-2 minute songs. The setting is unearned, because despite this movie being nominally set in Colombia, it really doesn’t matter, you could tell the story in any other setting, and so it just feels like it was set in Colombia for shots and giggles (that plus the fact that the most we get of Colombia in the movie is literally just superficial stereotypes) makes it really disappointing as a Colombian, the touching on our historical violence right at the end without any build up or emotional development earlier in the film feels like a cop out and a way to squeeze in a big emotional moment for the woefully underdeveloped abuela-Mirabel relationship. All in all, I’m very disappointed",r0uwz0
hrin0n9,"I'm very confused by the reddit response. Obviously there's a lot to love about this movie in terms of visuals and cultural representation, but that just makes it all the more infuriating how weak the story and conclusion is. 

  
Another point that I haven't seen mentioned: many of the songs had long ""dream"" sequences where the characters suddenly weren't in the real world and instead were in some abstract backdrop. This seemed like a lazy way to represent what the characters were feeling and took me out of the movie. It seemed more like a collection of music videos instead of having musical sequences that take place in the world of the movie, like Renaissance disney Beauty and the Beast or Lion King. Obviously there will be fantasy elements, but those movies kept it grounded and didn't just whisk the characters off to another dimension every time a song starts.",r0uwz0
hptajln,"Not gonna lie, the ending sucked ass. Same issue as Onward, the protagonist didn't end up getting what they always yearned for, making for an extremely underwhelming ending. When will Disney reach the end of this 'not letting the protagonists actually win' phase they're in 💀",r0uwz0

hq2vj3i,"Am I the only one who didn’t like the ending? It felt like such a cop out?

hr3g1uu,"Mexican-American here, but I felt I related with this family in my own at times. The generational trauma and drama spanning 3 generations is something I felt in my heart. My grandfather passed away and my grandma was left raising 7 kids. As much as I can criticize her because god knows she is not perfect, I realize she was just a woman doing her best. The sadest scene to me was when Bruno wanted to be a part of the family but felt he couldn’t. I have a cousin who has been octracized in my own family and most people always see the worst in her. I’m glad I have always been kind to her and always invited her family celebrations. My parents started tearing up at parts of this movie. It isn’t a perfect movie, but who says it has to be? It was such a good movie.

I’m glad the abuela wasn’t a straight up villain. She held a death grip on the entire family because she was scared to loose them after her husband was killed. It’s a very real and honest human reaction.",r0uwz0
hrebqih,Really enjoyed the movie until the final minute. Did they really need to get their powers back? Doesn’t that basically negate everything that led up to that point?,r0uwz0
hrfselq,"I finally saw it and started binging on the fan theories last night. Some people seem to think that Bruno's visions aren't absolute, since Dolores does end up with the man of her dreams. But from what I saw, Bruno's visions are absolute, the problem lies on him having to interpret them himself. Sometimes he can miss things (like the butterfly that Maribel saw) or misunderstand them (the candle getting brighter == magic healed). 

So Bruno could've just seen Mariano with a ring kneeling in front of Isabela, which does happen in the movie, and told her yeah he's gonna get engaged to someone else.",r0uwz0
hrwd2w2,"The obvious comparison for this movie is Moana, because it's the other one where Lin-Manuel writes all the songs. I really like Moana, and I'm tempted to call it my favorite Disney film of the 21st century (not counting Pixar, obviously). Encanto is a lot weaker by comparison. Many of the songs are integrated *very* clunkily into the movie. I think somebody forgot that while songs in a musical can be used to express a character's emotions to the audience in more direct language than the dialogue, they're not a sufficient replacement for that dialogue. This movie has like four ""I want"" songs and by the third one you start thinking that maybe the writers couldn't find a better way to work it into the conversation, so they use non-diegesis as a cop-out. Also, the opening exposition dump was terribly handled. 

I still liked this movie overall. I'm still a sucker for a well-animated culture piece. I'm just kind of surprised that the studio and songwriter that really knocked it out of the park with Moana apparently forgot a lot of the elements that worked in that movie. It felt a lot tighter. Maybe they can't handle it if there's more than five or so characters. Using the casita as a voiceless omnipresent character seemed like a direct callback to the ocean in Moana.",r0uwz0

hszh2bw,"Part of me feels like this movie sort of reinforced some of the ideas it was meant to break down.

hu4d2eo,"I'm super confused why Mirabel didn't get a Gift while Antonio does. I was under the belief that their Abuela's hyper-fixation over the Gift rather than the person is what ruined Mirabel's ceremony. If Abuela was having these misguided feelings for Mirabel, how did Antonio get his Gift with Abuela internally stressing out even *more* (as evidenced by her superstitious pleas to keep Mirabel away from the ceremony)? Did Abuela intoxicate herself or something to hold back those toxic thoughts at the crucial moment with the door?",r0uwz0
hu9pamr,"This is not me trying to hate on the film. It’s a genuine question please:

What is it that people like so much about this film? I watched it and it was enjoyable enough but it ranks pretty low on my personal Disney ranking. I thought the storyline was sweet but I didn’t get really invested in it like other Disney films. I just felt like they tried to include too many storylines and characters and it meant there just wasn’t enough time to fully flesh them all out. I also think the soundtrack is really overhyped. There are some catchy songs and I love the whole cast, but I also don’t think they were the strongest vocalists (sorry!). Like I say, I enjoyed it and I’m sure I will watch it again, but I just really want to know what it is that people go so wild for.

huaa88e,"The best part about this movie is there’s no real villain, just a dysfunctional family trying to live up to its grandmother’s standards. And the way my life is, it hurts. My family is the same. My uncle makes everything a competition between his kids and my aunts and uncles’ kids. I found out recently it created a resentment between my two cousins. One cousin joined the army to not deal with it anymore, and the other is getting married to her long time boyfriend and is being criticized harshly for it. Even I was used as “competition “ and “standards” and I didn’t know. I couldn’t even live up to those standards too (they compared me to my cousin getting married and said I was better for going to college…I dropped out). Definitely my favorite Disney movie so far.

hopok2d,"I really liked this movie, because it greatly reminds me of my family. I didn't like how they brushed over all the years they hurt Bruno and Mirabel. Also I don't mind if Mirabel never gets a gift, however it would've been nice if she got a room. To show that like the gift doesn't make the person just existing was enough. The grandma never apologizing to Bruno was annoying but realistic so I'll let it slide I guess.

&#x200B;

Also the switch up with how they treated Mirabel was too quick especially from Isabella and the rest of the community. Isabella constantly says Mirabel is ruining her life when in actuality she just felt superior to Mirabel. Then once she realizes that she can make mistakes just like Mirabel can make mistakes, she suddenly stops treating her like crap?!! 

&#x200B;

Finally the community doesn't even know what Mirabel went through so how would they know to stop treating her like garbage.

I think Disney needs to stop working with complex emotions like familial abuse and isolation or make longer movies.

htiw042,"I dunno guys. Fell like I watched a different film than you. It felt more like and extended music video to me. It's like they focused on music too much and forgot to add film and characters development. 

I enjoyed Mirabel and Bruno as characters, but rest of the family was meh. It felt like they were just a plot points needed to get where the screenplay wanted them, and not a fleshed out characters. 

Also I was confused about was the setting. 

I never had this problem while watching Coco, Luca or Moana, as its sets the world perfectly and explains where its set, how the life works. But here i was confused. I loved the colors and bright setting and animation quality, but the world building felt lackluster. 

For comparison Coco, Luca or even older Disney films inspired or set in different cultures, such as Mulan or Aladin or Anastasia, clearly state where it is and explains the culture and traditions, but Encanto felt very vague. I didn't get we were in Colombia until middle, until my husband googled it, as we wanted to find out where it was set and who were those soldiers at the beginning. Its like it completely ignored the world building aspect and only used the location as an 'exotic' background. 

So because it looks very vague the film leaves many things unanswered. Why did they run, what times is this set in, where it is, what is this magic power based on, why is there even magic and so. Coco, Mulan or Alladin does wonderful job explaining the culture to global audience that might not know it. Encanto felt like a random place in Southern America. Could be set anywhere in the world and it wouldn't change the story. In Aladin, Mulan, Moana or Coco the magic is based on the traditions, culture and religion of the region, in Encanto its like its just there because they needed to have people with superpowers in the story. Where did it came from, what is it, we don't know... Like you know, Frozen and Brave which explains the existence of magic there. 

I wouldn't mind less songs and more showing the world and their traditions through the characters in it. The first explanation song could easily be swapped for something to introduce the village, to make the place more developed.
And all we learned was at the beginning was : they run away from something, they found a magic candle, and that there is an Xmen family getting powers either from the house or the candle. The magic part was definitely undeveloped too. 

I will happily swap the first exposition song for an actual flashback, when the triplets learned they now got the magic powes, the first time it happened so we see what's happening and learn with them. 

I don't mind the whole Abuela is the antagonist, because she clearly is from the beginning, but that's isn't developed either. She wants make the family perfect and strong yet, treats her grandchild as Harry Potter was treated by Dudleys. There so much room for family character development, but not enough scenes for that. Instead everything is resolved by one hug and song. It's like you are told everything is good, instead shown.

I mean Pixar/Disney used to make complex emotional stories, so not sure what happened here.

Besides the ending there were other glaringly obvious plotholes that made me confused throughout (>!like Dolores not knowing about Bruno living in the walls!<). The movie as a whole just felt completely anti-climactic really. Like they didn't put much depth into the writing, they built up the reasons for the disappearing magic as some mystical thing but the actual ending was some cringy, saccharine Disney BS. I basically felt no connection with the characters either, there was no depth and development given to them. Abuela was a complete B from the beginning and bam she suddenly turned nice out of nowhere. IDGI.

The music was also just bad, the song ""Surface Pressure"" especially had me going ""Wtf?"". Like that song, arrangement wise, was so out of place. The only single good song was We Don't Talk About Bruno.

In that aspect the director really did an amazing work and Lin-Manuel Miranda' songs were excellent to support the story and i am saying this as as someone who does not like musicals.

However, I felt the story a bit generic to the point it can be adapted to any culture and country; that doesn't mean it wad a bad story, just i felt it could be done in another movie with a totally different culture and it will have the same emotional effect. Was it bad? No, the movie had very gut wrenching moments (abuela narrating her story, casita crumbling) and that can't be denied. If you like old Disney musicals this is a good movie for the family, you won't be disappointed.",r0uwz0
hmcu4kf,"movie was pretty good, all around a great experience, but two things bothered me: 1) they never explained how mirabel crossed the gap leaving bruno’s tower. seriously how? this one is whatever but i wish antonio’s animals had come to her rescue since it was hinted that way, and also makes way more sense than her jumping since she wasn’t able to do it without a rope the first time

2) how come dolores wasn’t able to hear bruno living inside their house? if she can hear luisa’s eye twitching in her sleep its really unbelievable she wasn’t able to hear him having dinner just a few inches away…..this one actually bothered me and made me feel like i missed something but i dont think i did. 

disney there are adults in the audience who will complain on reddit if you leave plot holes so Pls stay vigilant",r0uwz0
hmddy6u,Its strengths are the animation and characters. Especially in how the journey is going from one character to another who each get a chance to shine. I kept fearing the protagonist would get whisked away to go on a long adventure through different locations to get the macguffin and defeat the villain. I'm so tired of that story. Staying in one location and exploring the characters was so refreshing. Unfortunately the overall message and mechanics were really muddled and the ending is incredibly rushed. But strangely it's still one of the most satisfying Disney movies I've seen in a long time.,r0uwz0
hmeadji,"Absolutely loved this movie! Went to see it yesterday and it was just amazing, and although I’m glad that it didn’t end up with Mirabel getting an actual magic gift because she’s just as great without one, maybe even better, I do wonder what type of gift she would’ve gotten",r0uwz0

hmqnt9v,"I enjoyed it, and got teary-eyed just at the opening short.

The flashback to the grandmother escaping the violence in her village is up there with the opening scene from UP in terms of visual, gut-punching emotion for me. The one line that hit me was when the grandmother said, I had envisioned a different life for myself. There’s a lot of weight there, from someone who survived, but always has to carry that survivors guilt, that bitterness of lost possibilities.

I actually didn’t dig the music as much. The colors and the details on the hair, fabric, sand and water were all amazing.",r0uwz0

hom47qe,"Definitely up there as one of the best WDAS films in my opinion. Story was great with a great lesson, the main character was fun, and the music was pretty good too.

While I know the movie takes place *in* Colombia, I contend that the movie is actually mostly about immigrant families. For one, a lot of things Lin-Manuel Miranda is involved with has some tie to the narratives of immigrants to America. But in the actual movie, you have the grandmother escaping strife from her homeland and is delivered into he protection of the Encanto, a land of plenty. The last act of the movie emphasizes how she sacrificed so much to get to this new almost paradise-like place and that the family's grand lives they lead there is only possible because the grandmother went through all that. This places the grandmother as a first-generation immigrant figure. In this new land, she is able to thrive to greater level than she would have outside the opportunity given in the Encanto, and so much of her high expectations for her children and grandchildren come from a fear of losing all that and having to be reduced to hardship if they aren't perfect. Many second and third generation immigrants will find this very familiar as it mirrors the attitudes of the elders in many immigrant families that have gone through so much to make a life in a new country that provides opportunities they wouldn't have otherwise, but must not only be good but stand out to make it as an immigrant or child of an immigrant.

Of course, the themes of the movie can apply to any family, but I do feel immigrant family experiences are what most heavily inspired the family dynamics presented. Whether intentionally, or by nature of some of the writers being part of immigrant families.",r0uwz0
hpv1sqk,"Agree that there's some pacing issues on sections of the movie and how the music came on, but regardless thought it was a thoroughly enjoyable and beautiful movie to watch. Caught it at the cinema and now watched twice on D+, but still captivating.

Loved the characters and development, music was beautifully done alongside video clip scenes. Colours are amazing.

I'd give it close to a 10/10, mostly due to recency bias I reckon. Real test would be whether I'd still enjoy in 3 months down the road. How do I set reminders for this?",r0uwz0
hpzcb9r,"Edit One: I let my partner type the bottom paragraph so you have his EXACT theory. 

Heyo! So, I need another opinion.. my partner and I have been in a debate specifically about the “We dont talk about Bruno” song… when Isabela swings down to Mirabel and speaks “Hey sis, I want not a sound out of you,”… 

Now, partner’s opinion was that Isabela spoke that to Mirabel about Dolores’ previous line.. “He told me that the man of my dreams would be just out of reach- betrothed to another… it’s like I hear him now.” He’s 1000000% convinced, this is Isabela telling Mirabel to not mention THAT specifically. 

Now, my belief, is that this is just a sister feud. That Isabela doesn’t want Mirabel to say a word in fear that she would ruin or “sabotage” the evening. I feel like the film is pretty clear cut on the fact that Isa and Mirabel just don’t get along as sisters (until later.) she wants everything to be perfect. Mirabel is not perfect. Therefore she doesn’t want Mirabel to say a WORD… 

We cannot put this ONE argument down.. opinions/feedback would be appreciated!

So in the scene it goes to Dolores who has the power of super hearing, she talks about how Bruno said that her true love would be just out of reach betrothed to another while it zoom Mariano who is betrothed to Isabella, afterwards it zooms out to Dolores on the balcony as flowers grow down towards Isabella who looks at Mirabel and tells her she doesn’t want a sound out of her, while Dolores says in the background something about always hearing Mariano, I’m saying that Isabela doesn’t want Mirabel saying a word about how Isabela is getting engaged to Mariano who Dolores is in love with.",r0uwz0
hpzt6nu,Late to the party but this was a fantastic movie. So brilliantly animated.,r0uwz0
hq3tp1z,I feel like I might be alone here but it was just alright. The songs were pretty meh other than Bruno. The characters were cool and had powers but they just used them for comic relief than for any real substance. There wasn’t any real adventure or quest which is what I thought was going to happen. The ending left me very unsatisfied. So instead of being perfect the sister now makes cacti and the other sister gets her boyfriend and that’s the end of it? No powers for MC? Guess I just imagined the whole thing going in some larger direction than a few conversations and problem solved.,r0uwz0

hq757mf,"Yet another stellar addition to Disney's library of animated greats. This film is the very definition of magic, crafting a visually spectacular and effortlessly endearing story about family and belonging, made even better by fantastic songs and a spot-on voice cast.",r0uwz0
hqbr3n0,"I loved the part where her door to open was the door to the rebuilt home and it's why her's when she was younger disappeared. I know it's a feel good film about family, but Abuela's behavior was atrocious. A person who is actually like her doesn't have any right to act that way. She was tearing everyone apart slowly with expectation and pressure yet not actually contributing herself.  


""This family"" Mirabel IS part of the family. I wanted so badly for someone to say that or her to say it to Abuela herself.   


I get super depressed when I see people mention how a hyperbolic movie/show character who is objectively pretty terrible reminds them of their family/extended family. No one should have to deal with someone like Abuela and family doesn't mean anything if they don't learn that they are part of a unit themselves and no one deserves to be the black sheep of the family like that. Family means a lot, but it isn't everything and while I enjoyed the movie, I feel so sorry for all the kids and adults who watched the film and know that their respective Abuela's won't change, won't understand and yet feel pressure to keep everything together ""for the family"". When it's that obsessive and ""at all costs"" it's just toxic.",r0uwz0
hqhzg0f,"One thing about this movie that really annoyed me at first was the songs. I’m not a huge fan of musicals in kids movies. However, Every. Single. Song. Roped me in. It wasn’t just cliche music. There was growth and storytelling in each song. It was phenomenal, and I can’t remember a movie where the musical scenes did that to me. Isabela’s song is my favorite for the story, but luisia’s song is my favorite for the song itself. Surprisingly great movie.",r0uwz0
hqnpl0q,"This is one of the first Disney movies that I felt didn’t just throw a bunch of cultures into one movie (Moana, Raya, etc.) and it really shined. Disney has had such a controversial history with how they’ve portrayed people of color on the past, but this was suuuch a beautiful film in every aspect. It was so wonderful seeing brown and Black people of all sizes as the leads too. The story was so touching and relatable relatable and the music + visuals were great. Definitely one of my new fave Disney movies!",r0uwz0
hqrfgoc,"Damn I’m really late but can I can really relate to the movie. I see a lot of hate for the grandma which is understandable. The thing is she had to take care of a family and find a home on her own right after her husband being killed. She was afraid of losing everything especially her family. She wanted to make sure that her kids wouldn’t go through the same but by doing that she pushes away the thought of mistakes because for her one mistake could mean the end of it all. She’s still thunking of the terrible times before the powers. This is what blinds her from what she has now and how her thoughts/fears of the past can break the family she tried so hard to protect and nourish. That’s what she understands in the end. 

For the thing about Bruno it’s very true that a Colombian family won’t disown you outright but will very much treat you different. The idea/value of family is huge so believing that you callus be the cause of mistakes can weigh heavily on you. It could make you want to hide from family events and stay quiet in fear of becoming gossip amongst the family. Bruno must have felt bad every time he saw a bad future like he was at fault. The family still cared for him but just had bad times. 

Also you can’t keep a secret on a Colombian family no matter what. You’ll hear it coming around in no time. 

The grandmother being the head of the family is common and so are the stories of extreme hardship. My grandmother would take in children off the streets that had no family. She was the glue but she couldn’t do it all.",r0uwz0
hqvs4d2,"Anyone else interpret Isabella’s part in We Don’t Talk About Bruno as being a negative? I mean in the sense that all of them are lamenting how Bruno’s visions have come true and negatively affected them, but the words to Isabella’s seem really positive on the surface - talking about how the love of her dreams would be hers and her powers would grow and grow. Only later when she and Mirabelle hash it out it seems that she was raging against her always-perfect persona, so in that light the earlier Bruno lyrics would suggest that she wanted none of what he was prophesizing, despite the lyrics promising what most people would agree is a pretty sweet deal. Or am I just over thinking it?",r0uwz0

hravhlx,"It's definitely my second favorite Disney animation about a young woman of color trying to save her home from devastation with a bird sidekick voiced by Alan Tudyk with a Lin-Manuel Miranda soundtrack.

It was a fun movie. The musical sequences were fantastic (even if the first song dragged on a little too long) and the characters were mostly enjoyable and well written; of particular note IMO is the character who summons different weather based on her mood that spends almost the entire movie with thick rain clouds following her around, something that is more indicative of the family dynamic than anything else.

But, I am so fucking sick of Disney trying to coax emotion towards objectively shitty characters. Abuela was *awful,* awful to everybody but particularly Mirabel. As far as I can tell she was essentially riding the successes brought to her by the rest of her family's powers so her complete bitchiness felt even more unwelcome.

Abuela did absolutely nothing to deserve forgiveness and her backstory did not excuse her attitude or actions. I've noticed this theme popping up a lot in recent Disney movies (in Coco the mother was awful, in Soul 22 was a proud bully, in Luca his parents tried to banish him to the freaking deep sea) and every single time it feels forced to the point of absurdity. Mirabel finally standing up to her and shouting her down was very satisfying, so to have her immediately forgive her was a letdown.

I suspect the short runtime contributed to the weakness of the story which is a shame. The movie has great humor and music, but the story is so poorly paced it's distracting.",r0uwz0
hrbhkpp,"I liked this movie. To oversimplify, IMO it felt like a movie about the pressure of being ""gifted kids"" from the parents.

Growing up, I was always told I was smart, my sibling was the ""creative"", and the other was the ""brawn"". So in my mind I always had to be the smarter one. I was always focusing on studying, getting good grades and eventually taking my post-grad degree. 

Thankfully, my parents didn't pressure me to always be the smart one, but I did feel the need to excel. Surface Pressure kinda hit me a bit, and I really loved the way pressure was explained. It wasn't an overwhelming thing, but a small thing that piles up little by little.

hsyq84e,Not a fan of anyone outside of the family having zero importance except to marry into the family or show up to its parties.,r0uwz0
ht8vwaz,"Here are my issues with the movie, some may have already been brought up though. 

1. Bruno should've been the villain turned good or at least should've had a proper way to have everyone reconcile with him. Its great that he did what he did to protect his niece, but damn do I hate that they did him dirty. Don't like the message of ""stick by your family even if they mistreat you or don't think highly of you"". 

2. Abuela should've been called out on her BS of knowing the magic was in danger, but being so stubborn and prideful to do anything about it. She got off too easy. Yes I know she's been through hell, but still, she could've at least supported Mirabel instead of being the laziest antagonist I've seen in a movie.

3. What i REALLY think should've happened, mainly because this won't change anything too much, but Mirabel could've been both antagonist AND protagonist. Think the whole ""the future depends on you"" would've been really dope if it was up to her and NOT her grandmother as the magic only fell apart after Abuela made a big scene. 

Here's how I think it should've played out if you're interested:

Since there's a theory of her gift actually being a sort of Emotional Empath, I believe the movie should've been about making stronger connections with her family just as she did with her sisters in the movie during both musical numbers. Seems like she could use some work with her cousins as well but I'll skip that for now. I will say though that it could've been written to be that she was jealous of not having a gift, but seeing the tolls its taking on her family makes her appreciate a little normal. Her making peace with the fact that she may NEVER get a gift was the actual way to save the magic as her inner jealousy is no longer consuming her, but its just disguised as her building stronger connections and learning the real lesson along the way. This would only tweak a few dialogue and visuals with Vision Scene, but besides that all is still there. Now for the grandma I'd like for her to actually request Mirabels help after she catches her on the roof  while praying. She'd apologize and explain the burden she has and entrust her in this as nobody else knows but Mirabel was able to see the danger just like her (thinking to herself that Abuelo sent her). Now again, all still plays out the same, so I'd like the Dinner scene to still take place, but now seeing that Bruno had a vision of her and noone thinks highly of Bruno, that's where it goes down hill again and she loses her trust in Mirabel now seeing her as a danger rather than an answer to her prayers. This brings us back to the musical number with her sister where the cracks are being repaired. All is fine and dandy, argument happens, BUT just before the house falls apart I'd like to add in the argument that Abuela knew for a while now about the magic being in danger and even mention that Bruno never left the house and has been helping her restore the family even if everyone forced him into selfisolation and that only knowing her for less than an hour he's believed in her more than anyone else has. Besides this the argument is till pretty much the same, this would make the reunion more meaningful at the end as everyone will see the pain Mirabel has went through and build those bridges to see her as an equal and will recognize their selfishmess of driving Bruno away with their fear of him. This would also turn Mirabels jealousy into anger this time as she know clearly sees that gift or no gift, Abuela would never 100% respect her or anyone else. With all the negative emotions, boom, magic is gone. Afterwards everything is pretty much the same but in the musical number of her grandparents she can feel every ounce of pain Abuela has when thinking of the past and in a sense, SEE what happened just as its implied in that musical number. With both in pain they both realize Mirabel had a secret gift this whole time and finalize her thoughts of her being sent by Abuelo. That part can be ruled out as I know others don't want her to have a gift, but I just love the idea of her being in the past memories of Abuela during those scenes I just figured it would be cooler then it just be for visual purposes. Plus her gift to keep her family together can be seen as her having the ability to use those positive energies to bring their house alive and can even be like the village psychologist or something as she likes helping so much idk. Either or I tried to write it so her having a gift or not can be up to the viewer to theorize on or just let you know outright whats actually going on.",r0uwz0
hti8zgo,"So while the entire family seems under pressure from Abuela, any theories as to why Pepa and Felix's kids seem better adjusted than Julietas? Dolores, and Camilo specifically seem way more chill than Isa and Louisa",r0uwz0

Also, why did Dolores not have the heart to help Bruno? If she can hear him, she must have an idea that he was in a difficult state and she should've informed Abuela that Bruno didn't really leave, he was just hiding in the walls.

hvfhqcj,"Okay, so this movie is such a FRESH breath of air. It is astounding and charming to look at. Even the plot is really good. I don't like Abuela though cause even though there is not a true villain in this movie but her behaviour for a good chunk of the movie was very pathetic towards everyone, especially Mirabel. Shockingly, Mirabel didn't turn out to be a truly messed up person even though how she was treated for not having the gift.

My favourite part of the movie (and the most emotional) was when Pedro sacrificed himself to save his family and when Abeula give a heartwrenching cry. It was like the pain of losing her love and the father of her three babies at a time when she was uprooted, transformed into a powerful magic. It's like: if love is powerful, then grief has a strength that can crush. It is so powerful, that it can mess up a good person to being someone who will carry on that grief, for ages, giving it a shape of generational trauma.

The favourite song for me will be Surface Pressure because truly as the eldest kid and daughter, I *feel* Luisa. I am Luisa. And my little sister is Mirabel. Like Luisa, I have to appear strong and be like nothing affects me but that's. So. Not. True. 'Under the surface', I am scared and suffer from OCD, which scares me. Everyone turns to her for their problems I am supposed to be stronger, but I ain't.

Overall, a beautiful movie. Equal to the likes of Coco.

hw92wj8,"I know a lot of immigrant households have a grandma like the abuela in Encanto... but is anyone else wondering why they never really touched on the relationship with Mirabel and her parents? I know we see her dad defend her at one point in the movie... but as for interactions between Mirabel and her parents, there isn't really anything that suggests she has any issues with them. Is having this type of relationship with *just* your abuela more common in Colombia? Or did Disney just choose not to include that dynamic and instead just focus on the abuela? I definitely did find the family dynamic as a whole very relatable, but a lot of family conflicts I've faced are with my own parents.

The movie was cute, but the ending felt rushed. Like, the abuela actually swallowed her pride and apologized so fast (unrealistic, lmao) and that was all she needed to do to fix everything? Bruno was finally reunited with his family, and all she does is kiss him on the cheek and everyone is happy? I feel this would've worked better as a TV series or something. It would've been more impactful to have been able to watch characters grow, as opposed to getting a movie-happy-ending.

Also, LMM needs to do change his style up, or take a break, I dunno. There were so many lines during the songs where I thought ""That's so LMM..."" He's already quite overplayed at this point but I know Disney will keep going to him and soon enough everyone (even the ones who still think he's kind of fresh now) will get bored of him.

That the powers were tearing their family apart after all. But no they just get them back again for no real reason and the end!?

My head theory is that it would have been revealed that Mirabels gift was literally “the miracle” and that her emotions was what determined the strength of the miracle, but it got denied and changed into a more Disney message about how gifts don’t define who you are.

Which is why in the end when Mirabel puts the house back together and puts the doorknob back on, the “regaining of the power” felt so jarring - cuz it seemed in contradiction to the previous message about self-worth. 

For a possible explanation for why is there a need to do this? Because Abuela was the holder of the miracle and the miracle needed to passed on. Thus it was passed on Mirabels 5th birthday.",r0uwz0

hq4gh7i,I personally expected a bit more . Like yeah Isabel has issues with her family but really it’s only really the grandmother that it really persists. No issues really with anyone else.Also for some reason they had her talk about how weak the magic could be and everything yet theres not much of an indication of it getting weaker besides what happens with Mirabel and grandmother seems to seem to know something and then it’s gone. Her cousins ceremony goes fine and then suddenly the guy her sisters gonna marry and the family is there the next day. If maybe the powers were getting less powerful or grand and then maribels event happens that would be better . Having the ceremony right before the family comes over takes away any tension because how does that compare to a gift ceremony especially when the last one messed up. Theres barley any focus on the guy and Isabela at all or their relationship so it’s hard to make it seem that big of a deal.And her relationship with her siblings isn’t really that big of an issue. I mean she seemed upset of her sister with the flowers but just as much as the one with strength or anyone else’s gifts . It doesn’t seem any more important than her relationship with anyone else in the family .The only real tension was about the wedding but that was a backdrop to the door event. And we didn’t see anything focusing on the family or her sister with the dude she was gonna marry . Theres not really any scenes of the sisters interacting or the flower sister having to be perfect besides the one at the end with the grandmother . Like theres supposed to be expectations for her but they don’t really show much. There’s no scenes showing her strong sister really overworking till the scene where she sings. Theres nothing really separating them from anyone else in the family or anything showing them having any more hard work or anything really special until they bring it up and suddenly there’s work and expectations everywhere instead of it being spread throughout the film.There’s no real focus on the marriage or having her sister either fake it or express how important it is. Like it’s supposed to be so important but it’s barley focused on. There’s not really any issues with the rest of the family besides mirabel and her grandmother.,r0uwz0

Abuela vs Gothel? Hard choice...

I know that this is just a Disney movie and eventually they're all gonna be friends and she's gonna change for the better, but I just draw a line at forcing someone into arranged marriage.

I read some research paper about the use of accents in regard of stereotyping, however, I can't quite make out, if the voice over cast - which is clearly mostly Columbian - have accents or not. For me, most of the characters speak in a Standart American English and I can't really hear an accent - probably because I am not a native speaker. Despite Abuela Alma and uncle Felix, who clearly use a foreign-accented English I only - if at all - hear a stronger pronunciation of the /t sound at the end of a word.

htuwle8,"I see the word ""generational trauma"" thrown around a bit. I don't believe it applies to Encanto at all. 

I don't believe you can call Encanto ""generational trauma"" when the family lives together. Abuela is in the house and is the source of the trauma, it's not passed down from mother to daughter to daughter. It's direct. Also, the mother has probably five words in this whole movie. What's more, the movie mainly focuses on how perfect everyone is. It's hard to show trauma in a movie when everyone is always shown as perfect. The oldest sister gets a song and a couple scenes to show she's got some kinds of issues, but it's not explored. The pretty daughter gets the stupid trope of ""I'm perfect but I wish I wasn't so perfect"", and then she gets to be less perfect which actually just makes her more perfect. The mom is absolutely flawless in every scene. Where's the trauma? The Aunt seems to be really off and moody but it's presented as a joke. 

The movie is getting more credit than it deserves for some storytelling, I think. But ""apply buzzwords to something popular"" is the internet discourse of choice.",r0uwz0

Talking of past glory I thought Encanto might be the next Moana , as that's  my go to best animated musical but sadly despite the truly wonderful opening number the subsequent songs never capture the same magic.  

The songs are  a bit of a problem but not as much as the muddled story along side some pacing issues.  I really wasn't sure what the film was trying to say beyond toxic family dynamics destroy communities haha which is alot to say but I feel it could have been communicated more effectively.

Her father looks like a hispanic Walt Disney.  And it is set in Columbia, which could represent a movie studio in general terms as in Columbia Pictures.

I was really hoping this was true because it was something I noticed lol although I think the burns in hamilton and encanto are an F# and the burn in little mermaid is a G, but I could be wrong! I would love if it were true though because Lin-Manuel’s a genius and he worked on all of these projects, so I feel like he would do that on purpose. Maybe I’m wrong though!",r0uwz0

htepbnk,"Something I noticed on a rewatch is in the scene where Mirabel is looking at the photographs of the small kids and their doors, the silhouettes on the door match their appearance now. Like in the photos it is the small child in front of an image of an older them. I thought perhaps the door picture grew with them on the first watch, but that is not the case. It really struck me when Antonio got his door and his silhouette was small like he is now. I wonder what the significance of it is that the other images were older versions of them but now Antonio's is young.

hy40h6q,"What about the roles?  


Imma start this post by speaking about \*Isabela\* (one role at a time so it's not a longer post): Isabela is supposed to be the GOLDEN (grand) child: she had everything her gramma wished for -materialistically speaking: a house, a family as people to help her per se, the possibility to do whatever she wants-. 

Poor thing was supposed to be PERFECT since she had everything... not only that... she was the ANGEL of the family (it was Dolores' father who said it when we saw her in the first scenes 'our angel, our angel'... WTF). What a pressure!   
Everyone talks about Luisa's pressure, which is undeniable, yes, but what about our Isabela? This pressure to be THE grand-child. Fthemall!

Abuela ADMIRED Isabela, plz see their interactions... she's the one, the chosen one, the perfect one, to keep the family going on... what about what SHE THINKS??? The times where we saw something about it were when she completely ignored Mariano (The Madrigal family song), when her cousin -who was secretly in loce with Mariano, by the way... jealous a bit?- told her Mariano wanted 5 kids.... she didn't want that. She got pink flowers all over her head and A WHITE one -not pink-... that Abuela took off her head so she was perfectly rose and ready to bear kids. If you're latino or come from a big family you have probably lived that.

All the pressure of keeping the family branch going on. #horrible I do think she deserves more credit, and for whoever's looking for a Disney princess, we DO have one in this film: Isabela! i can imagine the floats full of flowers coming over so we can see Isabela.

&#x200B;

they're all perfect and this story is so magically awesome just because every character has its role (even if in real life we know that this role thing in families is destructive for the person at a whole).

&#x200B;

Let's play the role within the family BUT also know it's not the only face we have. We can be whoever we want and also find support in our family, no matter what, if we really want to (yes, I know  it's easier to say, but each one of us is only a person, then we're together and we get 'roles' but we don't lose our 'person' POV).",r0uwz0

i2w1zky,"Theory: new front door with everyone on it with Mirabel in the center is because, arguably while not magical, Mirabel's gift is her family or more accurately, her ability to maintain the stability of her family. She is the crux, the keystone, and no matter what disasters may arise and no matter how bad things might get, Mirabel will always hold her family together even if other extraneous factors are threatening to pull them apart.

Every family has problems, none are perfect. Misunderstanding, beliefs/prejudices, grudges, arguments, differences of opinion, unspoken feelings, lingering trauma... all leading to familial distance bred by a lack of communication and often a choice to withhold compassion when it's needed most.

The door represents the fact that Mirabel has a supernatural drive to ensure the solidity of her family. She'll investigate problems, poke and prod, and force her family to talk to her and each other to solve any internal issues. And she has the courage to act in the name of the whole Encanto as everyone there is an extended member of her family.

It reminds me of the idea of living your life with open hands instead of a closed fist. Abuela lived life with a closed fist to try and protect the family, and it pushed them away and made them feel that they were never enough. Mirabel, growing up under that and without a gift, was forced to learn how to live life with an open hand and showed her family how to accept themselves. Abuela kept the house alive through sheer force of will, Mirabel rebuilt it with love and acceptance when Abuela’s fist finally choked the life out of the family.

Abuela Alma strongly believed that if the Encanto ended then *all* is lost and she couldn't see past that (largely because if the trauma of the last time she lost her home, and losing the magic is like losing Pedro all over again.)

hrmg50l,"I'm kind of sad that this people's takeaway from Abuela in the movie. 

Abuela went through something incredibly traumatic in her life and she thrived by becoming incredibly disciplined. People like that learn the hard way that the greater good often requires sacrifice. Like hiding the truth so your children can thrive.

My grandparents and great grandparents lived through the hunger winter in WWII. They've been absolutely horrible about food, waste and hoarding ever since. Younger people found them insufferable to deal with.

But what they didn't think of was that my grandparents and great grandparents behaviour made the difference between life and death at the time. That horrible attitude was the same reason they could stretch food further and allow more people to live.

The cost is that you can never let that go again. Abuela is the same. She's seen horror that her family can't even imagine. The way that changed her is exactly why her descendants grew up so happy and carefree.

But just like my grandparents could never abide the slightest bit of waste, even after decades of living in plenty again. Abuela could never ease up on the control. On the feeling responsible for her family's fortune to the point where she'd lie and push to try and keep things safe.

She's not a villain. She's the manifest cost of what her family paid for the good fortune of her descendants. The moment we can no longer emphasise with that is the moment we're that many steps close to things like Abuela's (and my grandparent's) experience happening again, because we're missing the empathy to understand.

It's important to not just look at what people do, but why they do it. Why they've become that way.",r0uwz0

hu9ld8l,"Man vs self. Man vs fallout.

The pain of the thousand days war made Abuela the SOUL person in charge of a town of people including her three infant children. Husband chopped down by a LITERAL four horsemen. In front of her and the town to be.

For years she watches as her family grows and the town grows too. She begins to foster fears that all her hard work to remain perfect will fade to nothing. Her children cope with that by literally granting clear skies for today, food to heal the past injuries, and someone to lookout for the future.

And the town still had issues; any family will. The town needed strength to build itself up. Then apparently it needed beauty to keep up appearances. 

Of course then the town for were surely talking about her behind her back. When even these could not settle Abuelas fears, she needed someone, ANYONE to help. 

And when all of those kids weren't enough to settle her fears, she realized no gift would make her happy, and that's what she got. Nothing.

Antonio though? Antonio is LITERALLY GIVEN A GIFT FROM MIRABELLE. The only thing we see him given is a decorated box containing a hand made leopard just because she dubs him an animal guy 

Antonio is the first gift given to the family Madrigal that is for the posesser of the gift, not for what Abuela thought was best for the town/family. Note that Mirabel walks Antonio up and Casita seems to be just fine with it? Moments before preventing Antonio from going upstairs just a LITTLE early?

Abuela admits when she thinks no one can hear her, that she knows something is wrong, but a broken clock is right twice a day. 

She's afraid the town will abandon her if the gifts fade.
Pepa is afraid she will have an emotional breakdown and ruin things.
Bruno is afraid his fortunes will make him unlovable.
Louisa is afraid she isn't strong enough, more Isabella perfect enough.
Mirabelle most of all afraid she won't make her family proud.

Each and every one of them wrong wrong wrong! They all act on fear responses.",r0uwz0

hmbclyg,"The family's position in the community was predicated upon them having gifts and being magical. Abuela saw the loss of her community as well as her home when she and her husband fled. His sacrifice wasn't just for her and his children, it was for the entire community of refugees. So the community is her responsibility in her eyes and to destroy that, is to forsake the sacrifice of her husband. 

She was the architect of this community for so long, which is why everything had to conform to her vision. Isabella had to be married to that other family to strengthen the community, in her eyes. Everyone had to see her family as the strength or else she feared it would crumble. This is why Bruno was ostracized after the community interpreted him as a harbinger of bad news. It hurt her family's position. This is also why Mirabel was kept at arms length. Her lack of a gift made the family look weaker. Again, this is why the little cousin's ceremony was so important to Abuela.

This is all to say, the gift itself was less important than just having a gift. Because having a gift helped maintain the credibility of her family and further strengthened Abuela's idea of the community.",r0uwz0
hmdhd80,"I can see Camilo's value to the community when it does come to small things like shapeshifting to be smaller or taller or just another pair of hands, but who the hell was Dolores helping?

Let's be real, in terms of pure function and necessity that community owes a debt to Luisa and Juiletta. Presumably Pepa helps in farming what with being able to provide endless sunshine and rain but does that really matter if Isabella can supergrow vegetables if she put her mind to it?",r0uwz0

When they’re all coming to the house for the ceremony, he turns into everyone that he’s greeting to welcome them effusively.

hma67zw,"Completely agree.  The fight with her and abuela should have happened at Antonio's party, with Mirabella then going...somewhere. Instead, 15 years of mutual resentment is brought out into the open and completely resolved in 5 minutes.

Same thing with Bruno: the dude is ostracized by his family, and one hug from Abuela makes it all better?  The contrast with this and Frozen -- where Elsa still has emotional hangups until the end of the *second* movie -- just highlights how trite this plot was.",r0uwz0
hnac02h,Exactly this. I also thought the extended side of her family was heavily under used. The weather girl and shape shifting boy were really just there for visual gags and the hearing girl was just there to gossip for that one scene. I thought at least Antonio would be more relevant to the story since he had such a strong relationship with Mirabela but it didn’t really go anywhere once he got his gift.,r0uwz0
hq6zuhq,"Honestly, this movie shouldn't have been a musical. The songs really don't serve any purpose beyond spending 3 minutes telling the audience exposition we already know. 

The middle of the movie should've been Mirabel witnessing Abuela shutting down her sisters for wanting to pursue other things other than their gifts. We don't see why Luisa has to bottle her emotions or why Isabella must only grow flowers or pretty plants, we're just told they do.",r0uwz0
hmdjp3w,"Seriously, the lead-in to Isabella's musical number felt so jarringly clunky compared to how smooth say the segue into ""We Don't Talk About Bruno"" was.

Isabella seems so immediately self-concerned and surprised at the appearance of the cactus, she's not paying any attention to Mirabel...but then by the end of the song she's attributing this change in perspective *to* Mirabel????

I just wish there had been a little bit more dialogue before Isabella had her emotional breakthrough.",r0uwz0
hqiuu0c,"Late to the party. I completely agree about the pacing. Luisa having a song was weird to me, until finally Isabella had one. And her immediately befriending Mirabel was rushed. Also, Bruno's vision being Mirabel needing to reconcile with Isabella was very strange. It should have been the grandmother, or the whole family.",r0uwz0
hqggztp,"Completely agree. I know it's a little trite to compared animated films to Frozen, but there Anna and Elsa's fight is right at the beginning and takes the whole film to resolve. Here, tensions between family members were solved in a few moments, whether it was the sister's transformation or the grandmother's self-reflection. Even the fight leading to the destruction of the house was horribly rushed.",r0uwz0
hmd8wmc,"Totally felt extactly the same. The peace was totally off.

For me the beginning was perfect: the setup of the story, the explanation of the gifts... I was getting ready for some really interesting story. But the middle and end or climax where off... Particularly for me is exactly what you mention about the sister. Something major seems to be needed and one song after it's achieved. Then... not much.

I was a very nice movie for the visuals and some songs but the story left me wanting more.",r0uwz0
hpu9i05,"Same! I wanted to love this movie, but can't say I do.

For me it all started with Surface Pressure. It rushed character development sooo much and most other songs after that felt similarly out of place. I felt like songwriting and screenwriting were not really in sync and am left a bit confused by the pacing.

Which is quite a shame because this movie had a lot to love: The concept, the characters, the setting, the visuals. It was just so awkwardly strung together that I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to. Really a pity.",r0uwz0
hq3m5fb,"I completely agree. It was captivating, but also the pacing felt strange. It felt like a ton of build up with a very very sudden payoff. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it just threw me off a bit.",r0uwz0
hqeoajg,"I'm late to the party, but I agree with your pacing issues. Some character developments did not feel earned because the pacing was off. There was sometime very little build up, and then all of a sudden we find out about a bit conflict or character issue that is then immediately resolved?

Overall, very enjoyable movie for me and my kids, but ya, pacing issues.",r0uwz0
hqrfv2d,"I feel like with Isabela her only issue with Mirabel was that she was being pressured by her abuela to be perfect and saw Mirabel as a threat to that perfection. Whatever abuela hated, Isabela hated (same goes for whatever damages the family's rep). Once she realises she doesnt have to be like that and comes into her shell and gets some freedom, that pressure is gone and theres no particular reason for her to hate Mirabel (especially since Mirabel helped her reach that point) or treat her badly. On Isabelas end it makes sense to me how she would no longer hate Mirabel. For Mirabel I think she hated her cause she acted like a prima donna and a snob and wasnt nice to her. Once that changed I supposed she would have no reason to be at odds with her sister. Thats just my interpretation though, could be completely off the mark 😂",r0uwz0
hr0thnv,"This is exactly how I felt walking away from the movie. It's really fun, and the setting/characters are great, but it all felt so rushed and needed more time to breathe. The music too, while high-energy, was incredibly utilitarian without much depth. I really just think the whole thing needed more time. Weird as it sounds, a small eightish episode series that gave each character proper arcs and time to shine would have been so much better for the story and pacing than this film was.",r0uwz0
hrvak18,"Dude, Lin-Manuel Miranda (the songwriter for this film) is a god at this point with millions of fans hung up on every word he says so criticizing him is ...brave to say the least. If a little reckless. But yeah, I also found them underwhelming. Character introduction songs most of the time. If you cut them out it would be fine, you would simply have a normal human conversation. Coco's were better and more natural.",r0uwz0
hrda3ob,"One of my favourite things in the movie was that it actually diverged from the Protagonist Girl needs to save X, and in order to do so must go from A to B, but the journey isn’t as straightforward as it seems, shenanigans happen, Protagonist teams up with sassy male sidekick sometimes turned love interest-formula that both Pixar and Disney does SO MUCH. 

Too often Disney and especially Pixar films introduce this charming and interesting environment and concept only to completely ignore it for the entire middle 50% of the film. I really appreciated that the gifts and the house were continuously explored throughout the movie. 

But the pacing could have been better.",r0uwz0
hrwxite,"I completely agree, especially with regards to the music. LMM didn’t do his best work in this one, and it’s rife with tropes that I personally find really irritating about his work to begin with. We Don’t Talk About Bruno is okay, but the rest, agh.",r0uwz0

hrq5wqn,Wow. Thank you. I was beginning to wonder if I was crazy. It didn’t feel like a Pixar movie at all. It felt like they tried to recreate the success of Coco but removed everything that made Coco good.,r0uwz0

ht56kqv,"I really loved the first 2 parts but had to double back and check the time when they were at the river. I had a bit of a double take when I realized things were resolving so quickly. It had an amazing set up, but after the conflict was laid out it didn't fell like anything actually *happened* before resolving itself. Idk the ending just felt underwelming.",r0uwz0
hv8uczs,">I feel like that should have happened halfway through the movie, but it happened like 85% in - it was resolved essentially immediately after. Or how the sisters can't stand each other, but after a short song they are completely in sync

You desribed my problem with the film perfectly, the conflict should have started earlier like at the beginning of the second act, but it feel like they waited too long to get to the conflict started in the finale act and it ended way too quick.

Also, the film should have made the relationship between Mirabel and Bruno to be the emotional core of the film, rather than spreading out between Mirabel with Antonio, Isabella, and Abuela Alma.",r0uwz0

ht5pn3d,"I would agree with you on a few of the recent movies, however I don't think Frozen and Moana really count as they are just the one song in the movie that does it? Every other songs are happening in the moment and for 'You're welcome' and 'Summer' the idea of a dream world makes sense because of the contexts of the songs.

Summer is literally about him imagining what summer will be like as he a snowman has never experienced it before. It is bright and his perfect fantasy.

Likewise with 'You're welcome' it has subtle undertones,  it shows that Maui has been trapped on this island for many years and he has had to maintain his own fantasies or chorus of adoring people to combat his loneliness/stroke his ego when he isn't able to do hos normal hero activities. Moana also sees Maui as a perfect demi-god so she is all too happy to walk into his fantasy. 

Like I would get it if those were the whole movies but they're very small parts of the overall soundtrack. They are the slight change of pace/odd one out but it serves a storytelling and pacing purpose.

Yes I admit I saw this movie and I wad like WOW there are a lot of dream sequence songs, but I guess it makes sense when they were given a magical house created by a candle that bestows miracles on it's family.",r0uwz0
htg9shd,"I agree, except for ""You're Welcome"". In that song, he's hypnotizing her and the visuals get trippier the deeper she goes into the trance that he uses to steal her boat.

Everything Maui does in that scene, from mesmerizing her with his tattoos that start to move, to tapping on coconuts is part of his techniques to hypnotize her.",r0uwz0

On this island shows the entire island and all it's characters. But at the same time, it's limited to the island alone. Which is the point.

hmwyl7x,Definitely and this may have been one of the first times where I just didnt like that as much. It took me out of the story and I wasnt as immersed as I wanted to be. In Moana I feel like the singers made the songs he wrote their own with their own vocal riffs and vocal prowess.

Like in Abeula's part during The Family Madrigal how she repeats ""must keep the miracle burning"" twice and then later Luisa does the same thing with the word circus in her song and the phrase ""what breaks the camel's back"".

This was Grandma before, but Mirabel was the successor. Its sad that they didn´t explain better in the Flashback why Mirabels ceremony didnt work. Did Abuela get signs that it should be the front door or something like that? Since the glowing Door there was a setup for failure for poor little Mirabel and as far as I understood the House does that by itself.",r0uwz0
hninwvt,I agree with some other comments in that I think Mirabel’s gift is the same as her Abuela’s - uniting the family.

hssx46x,"On Abuela and the resolution: The core of the movie is being able to talk to your family honestly. Open and honest communication. The whole movie, Abuela wants the facade that everything is perfect, and the whole family feels that pressure to the point that they don’t talk about their problems.

Mirabel luckily has pretty open and caring parents, but they 100% were not sitting down with Abuela the way that Mirabel sat down with her mom. Maybe when they were kids, but as adults, they are all worried about keeping everything perfect. 

So the resolutions in this film with each individual character is literally Mirabel finally having honest conversations with her family. She slowly discovers and reveals the truths that her Abuela and family desperately try to keep hidden. All it took for their problems to be resolved is actually discussing them truthfully.

Mirabel has a perception of Isabella that leads to resentment, and vice versa, but neither of their perceptions are based in reality. Isabella doesn’t even like trying to be “perfect”, yet her sister resents her for it. Them finally talking about it reveals that their issues with each other aren’t based in reality. 

And so it goes with Abuela and Mirabel. Abuela had so much trauma and put so much pressure on herself and her family to honor her husband’s sacrifice and the miracle that she lost sight of the family itself. Mirabel forced her to confront something she was avoiding.

Maybe that pacing feels awkward to people, but that’s true to life: once honest communication starts, it’s pretty easy to solve a problem. You can’t solve a problem if you don’t acknowledge it.

On the point of the magic: everything doesn’t need a defined origin. The family was granted a miracle in a time of need, and that’s all we know. It’s tied to the river somehow, the grandmother, and/or the candle. If they tell us that God or some deity of refugees made the miracle, does that add much to the story? Not really. The themes are the same. We understand the miracle as much as the characters understand it.",r0uwz0

This family is dysfunctional, and Abuela's behavior is a spitting image of narcissism -- My wife and one of my oldest friends both grew up in families like this, and my wife was a sobbing mess by the time this movie was through because it hit so close to home.

IMO Abuelita was abusive, and children of families like this don't generally get apologies. They get parents who will watch the family fall apart under their watch while blaming everyone but themselves.

I get that Disney wouldn't just leave this movie on a Downer note, but Abuelita's contrition still came too easily.

Encanto was all over the place, trying to piece together too many characters and getting so lost in doing so that there hardly seemed time to have a climax or ending. Mirabel essentially just said “Oh it’s Abuela’s fault. I’m angry. Okay now she’s forgiven.” And that was the end of it. So strange. They even just suddenly accepted Bruno again even though he had literally been living in hiding for about a decade.",r0uwz0

They are HURT, they are VULNERABLE. What I love about Mirabel is while she IS spunk, we get to see her insecurities, her being an underdog.

In Raya, the real antagonist is actually Raya herself, because it's her bitterness and distrust of others that prevents things from going back to normal. Namaari and her mother and only there to divert your attention from this, from the fact that you are not dealing with traditional Disney villains here. And then Raya literally has to take the risk and sacrifice herself first to make everyone else forget the distrust they learned from her.

Moana is so full of pep an desire for the horizon. She hates stagnation and the status quo and wants to be explorers like her ancestors.  She meets a larger than life gentleman and attempts to fix his past sins to heal the land. 

Encanto is all about those two words on every youtuber's lips; >!generational trauma!<.

According to Matt Walker, Senior Vice President of Music at Disney Animation Studios, they actually changed their usual workflow in regards to choreography specifically for Encanto. Usually, they will bring in choreographers late in the animation process more to get the details right for their characters and to help with certain songs. For Encanto, they brought in choreographers with knowledge of Colombian dance styles early on in the animation process and basically had them act as the animation models for the film's animators. They actually showed us some in-progress animation of ""We Don't Talk About Bruno"" side-by-side with the reference footage from the choreographers to compare. 

Really awesome presentation that also had the film's composer Germaine Franco, and the voice actress for Luisa, Jessica Darrow, there in person along with a ton of interview footage from Lin, Stephanie Beatriz (voice of Maribel), and the film's directors talking about various aspects of the film, especially in regards to the music.

A lot of the characters are very fun.

Some of the songs just didn’t have impact. Were they big emotional numbers, or exposition, or what? 

The pacing in this movie is blazing fast. I think it’s on purpose to keep communication between family members low without it being weird.

Pepa is by far the most emotionally distraught. She's felt Abuelas wrath and scrutiny the longest, and deals with it the worst.

Pepa has the most well adjusted children of the entire family (Mirabels insight not withstanding).

Now look at Julietta. All three of those calm and patient woman's children have serious mental trauma that is causing them serious pain.

While I loved the reconciliation between Mirabel and Isabela, it happened too quickly and with almost no real effort of genuine apology, empathy, or introspection.  It simply felt like a red-herring plot device to obfuscate that the real conflict was between Mirabel and her Grandma.

I think this is a huge reason I can't wrap my mind around feeling bad for Isabela... I KNOW she had to do what the family wanted regardless of what she wanted. However, she was REAL comfortable gaslighting Maribel and talking down to her in front of audiences. The 1st time there isn't a crowd watching their conversation, then Isabela finally lets it slip she doesn't want this marriage... I can't see her as anything but the mean girl Isabela portrays. It takes away from Maribel's jealousy that is clearly an issue of a victim turning into a victimizer. I did not feel the resolution the show intended to portray.",r0uwz0

Antonio’s communication with animals means the village has their own bodyguards and animal army if anything goes down, and he can get them to help villagers too.

Mirabel got her proper door, the front door to the whole home and the magic leaves because the family is ready to be with out the miracle as they are together and stronger, especially with the community behind them.  


Then you could of still had the whole ""Mirabel ""kills"" the magic as well as getting her proper door, but also that the message isn't undermined. The family could of even been disappointed for a moment after seeing the magic seemingly come back only to basically say goodbye because they could get along with out it and been okay with that in the end. Would of extra fulfilled the prophecy/vision and still had Mirabel ready to take over for Abuela later.  


But it's a fantasy movie at heart and kids don't tend to like (or at least hollywood doesn't think they do) movies that show growing up and change in that way.   


Maybe even revealing in the process that Casita was the spirit of her grandfather or something as some people think it might of been.

hmpfpgy,"I had been thinking about this for a couple of days and came to this realization.  Abuela, like Mirabel, doesn't have any gifts.  She's not super-strong, like Luisa, nor does she have superficial hearing like Dolores.  She watched her children and grandchildren all grow and receive their gifts.  The only ones who don't have a gift are Mirabel and those who married into the family.  Mirabel, I believe, will become the new matriarch when Abuela passes away.  


Traditionally it would go down to the oldest child to be the new leader of the household, but I guess they can also choose who will be the new leader; who will hold the candle to light the way for the others.  While Abuela was still alive at the end of the film, I'd imagine after the credits rolled and the film ended, she had a lot to teach Mirabel about being the new matriarch.  How to conduct herself around the family and the public (village).  All the little nuances each member has, aside from their gifts.  All the little nuances of Casita as well.  And, of course, the ritual involving the candle.  


I'd imagine that the Candle will extinguish itself again when its ready for a new Keeper, whether it's another woman (Mirabel's daughter or granddaughter?) or maybe next time it'll be a man (Maybe Dolores' son or Luisa's grandson?) that'll be the Keeper of the Candle.",r0uwz0

I can’t put in words how I felt when we learn that the whole thing started with an episode of violence and displacement. That scene of people leaving their home at night running away hits too deep, as it’s the story of hundreds of thousands of colombians. Magic was the way to deal with pain in the movie, and in reality you see communities trying to overcome the situation by putting a bright smile, never losing hope and helping each other, so it was lovely to see.

Other than that, the colors, the music, the food, the Spanish dubbing with a local accent, the animals, the plants, the natural landscapes… everything was on point, and a joy to watch on a film of this scale.",r0uwz0

We don’t dress in traditional wear all the time, we don’t eat arroz con pollo and buñuelos every day, just a lot of stereotypes. The one thing I of course have to admit that they nailed was some of our mannerisms, the way they pointed with things with their lips, the way someone said “Miércoles!” in surprise, the little things.

The tall palm trees and the mountains similar to the Cocora Valley. The literature references with yellow butterflies.

The movie creators did their homework in this aspect. The trauma and displacement Abuela experienced in the beginning is, unfortunately, an all too familiar story.

hq714i8,Would've loved to see a 3D rendition of Disney's Hercules,r0uwz0
hlv3doq,"I think the family was always fracturing, but (like the house) only Mirabel could see it at first.

From the aunt who was always pressured to have a literal sunny disposition, to Luisa who was only valued for her physical strength, to Isabela who was going to be forced into a life that other people thought was perfect for her - most of them were a lot more miserable than they were willing to admit, but they kept on pretending that the miracle was wonderful. Even Bruno was shunned whenever his visions contradicted the everything-is-perfect vibe that Abuela wanted to maintain. And of course Mirabel was always subtly viewed as lesser than everyone else. As time went on, the gifts started to become the ONLY thing they valued about themselves or each other, and that's when the magic started to fail. It came back after Mirabel's work to help the family acknowledge themselves as an actual, sometimes-flawed family rather than a perfect collection of superpowers.

That's why it was a nice touch that Mirabel's ""door"" ended up being the entrance to the house itself - even if she doesn't have a magical gift, she rebuilt the house and the family into something better and stronger, and all the other powers are contained inside the work that she did.",r0uwz0
hlvedmw,"as a colombian i felt it completely wrapped up. the real magic is found in the comunal experience not in the individual super powers of any of them. the grandma realizing she needed to confide in others and release her trauma allowed for the rest of town to finally feel welcome, then maribel puts the last touch in the door and because of all the town being involved in the construction they realizes that magic was inside all of them all along. 

i might be wrong. but thats a common ending to some famous colombian books where it seems they drew inspiration- and i’m glad they did that because it also subverts the usual trope of the hero randomly developing power last minute.",r0uwz0
hluwbb4,"> That said, I'm not 100% on how the plot of this wrapped up. They didn't really define the rules of this magic all that specifically. Which is fine, but even after watching I wasn't totally sure why the magic faltered and why it came back. I guess it had something to do with Abuela becoming so obsessed with the powers themselves and how to utilize them that she wasn't appreciating the simple blessing that is your family? So because of that the powers were taken away, and once she learned her lesson they came back? That sounds right but it wasn't totally clear.

I think you're on point. 

The more fractured the family became, the more the powers/Casita weakened... it only came back when they put aside every other concern and focused on their family.",r0uwz0
hlv6byp,"I wondered about the magic rules, but I think the vagueness was intentional. Think of old fairytale tropes where magic doesn’t really have comprehensible rules. Why does true love’s kiss break curses? Why does Cinderella have a fairy godmother? Why do some animals talk? And so on.",r0uwz0
hluvt9t,"I agree with everything you said.  The music was great, and the story was good, but there were some confusing points.  Like you said, how the magic works is confusing.  I don't need to understand it all, but they never truly explain why it went away, or why Mirabel was never given a gift.  It felt vague to a fault.  The point is given, that you don't need to be extraordinary to excel, and how those who are viewed as such can be exhausted from the expectations.  But that doesn't really explain why ""the miracle"" crushed this exuberant child.  Maybe they explained it, but if so, I missed it.  I kept waiting for some reveal that she actually received some type of power that was dormant while the family was losing their way.  That being said, I love that she never gained a true gift.  Kids being given a message that other people are going to ""seem"" more important, but we all have a role to play, is important.  I just don't like that we were never told why, since it seemed kinda cruel.",r0uwz0
hm4898o,">Which is fine, but even after watching I wasn't totally sure why the magic faltered and why it came back. 

My intrepretation was that the grandmother's inability to fully embrace Maribel (and to a lesser extent, her brother) as full members of the family was causing the house (which is a symbol of her husband's sacrifice for his family) to crack. The grandmother's ability to recognize that she has mistreated Maribel and her embrace of her brother (and Maribel's acceptance of Bruno's gift) repaired the house.

Just don't ask me why Maribel has visions in the beginning of the movie (or why she doesn't get a gift).",r0uwz0

As a child of a toxic family I was raised to have the lowest self esteem and to put my families needs over everyone else. As a child I was made to believe that my family’s problems began and ended with me and my brother. This raised me to believe that I was responsible for for fixing my family. And of course it never worked, no matter how much I sacrificed, spoke, put other above me. Watching Mirabel be acknowledge and praised for her gift was making me cry because that’s what I wanted to do too.

hrqo0fn,"When you've been beaten down emotionally for years like Bruno was that over-apologizing becomes habit. Like people will apologize for things they didn't even do.  So Bruno was far enough along mentally to leave the crumbling house and try to save Mirabel, but not so well adjusted as to see that none of it was his fault, or that he shouldn't have to apologize.

Or maybe he saw his niece and his mother hugging it out after communicating and thought, 'huh, maybe I didn't have to hide for 10 years, maybe a good argument could have fixed this'. I mean, I don't think it would have worked, but I could see that thought coming up.",r0uwz0
hr5v2zy,"""I have a lot to apologize for"" would have made sense of Bruno were a villain, but he's not. I was just mentioning on Twitter today that I could totally see an alternate universe where Bruno got sick of Abuela's shenanigans to ""preserve the miracle"", left the 'encanto' for the city - which, by the way, Abuela and Mirabel were going to travel to in the original plot - and used his power to gain political power and/or followers, with the aim of ""preventing another Violencia"".

That storyline, at least, would also leave the option open of Bruno having done things *to* ""apologize for"", under the misguided impression that he ""was just trying to make sure what happened to grandfather never happened again"", and to ""share 'the miracle' with the world"". It would also re-define Bruno's character as someone who has good intentions of using his power to help others - like his family - outside of the 'encanto', and to serve as a foil for Mirabel.",r0uwz0

Immigrants and people who have endured colonial oppression instill a very high set of expectations in their children. For them it's a way to protect their children to ensure they have a bright future. It almost like they pass down their shame and this is how trauma transmits across generation. The shame and the constant inadequacy that was beautifully portrayed in the movie. What also hit me harder was that the community comes together to build a foundation.

I definitely liked it more than you did, but I agree, the songs weren't as good as I hoped (though I did really like a few of them) and you're also spot-on that most of the characters were *very* underdeveloped.  I'm thinking of the changeling kid used for physical comedy, and the super-hearing girl, who apparently can only hear things when it's convenient for the plot.  Dad was just a foil for bee-sting laughs, and Mom was disappointingly under-protective of Mirabel. Plot was definitely too simple, but fine, it wasn't a murder-mystery and needs to be digestible by kids.  

I loved how well the characters moved and danced and were animated though. I'll watch this again.",r0uwz0

Personally, I think some stories are going to natrually hit harder than others. 

For me, the feeling of being ostracized and questioning why other people have things that you don't have hit really hard. I know that other people really connected with Coco and that movie didn't mean much to me, as I never had a grandparent I was close to. I also think visually the movie had clear influences of magical realism and the music felt fresh enough to keep me entertained. 

I had issues with the third act but overall I very much enjoyed the movie.

If you have a movie centered around a large family of wacky characters, it’s fine if some of them are just there for a couple of jokes or maybe to help advance one plot point. But, I feel like there were a couple of key relationships in the movie that didn’t get enough attention. Like I think that Mirabel’s sister, who could grow flowers, should have been developed more. 

And then there was the kid at the beginning who could talk to animals. The movie spent a lot of time establishing that he had a close connection to Mirabel, and then I thought that relationship was going to be more important to the story. But it wasn’t really.",r0uwz0

The story and the messages it conveys. 

The plot and the pacing of the film. Especially how conflicts are introduced and resolved. 

More than half the characters are underdeveloped. They only seem to be there to advance a single plot point, or they are dropped completely after they do something (Antonio and the strong girl) 

The songs are bland, introduced weirdly and often feel unnecessary. Only sing if you can *only sing* and talking isn’t enough to convey the emotion.

hubo0x7,"I felt that they didn't get the *exact* same gifts.

All of the powers before Mirabel were to sooth Abuela's wartime loss trauma and anxieties placed on her by the townsfolk looking to her after Pedro died. 

When all the powers in the world couldn't keep Abuela satisfied, then the miracle realized ""nothing will make Abuela satisfied"" and gave her a grandchild with exactly that power; nothing. 

Antonio is the first person, who is literally given a physical gift of animals hours before his magical one, who's powers are for HIS benefit and not with some expectation of being superman. Also notice that even though he has no expectation placed on him by Abuela, he uses his powers to forward the plot and keep Mirabel on her quest.

When mirabel gives a gift, it's for the person. When Abuela's version of the miracle gives a gift, it's for the betterment of *all*. Sort of a flip on the ""personal gain"" schtick we've been fed for years. Abuela is another set of Elsa parents; your gift isn't for you to enjoy.",r0uwz0
hmeeej5,"I kind of agree that it wasn't good, but I do have answers to your questions specifically.

What it's about? People have said here it's about generational trauma. Grandma was hurt by losing her home and husband, as a result is too hard her family, her being hard on her family was causing friction and cracks, as in her family was cracking under pressure, like Bruno saying he left because his gift ""wasn't useful to the family"". It gets resolved when Mirabel gives some love to her Abuela, telling her ""grandma I see you, I see how much you were hurt and how much you suffered, you are so strong for what you did, building our family"". This heals Abuela a bit, Abuela realizes she's been too hard and the magical gifts are not so important, it's the people who are important, like Mirabel is miraculous even if she has no gift, because the gift is her, it's all of her children and grandchildren. But then when Abuela relaxes the pressure on the gifts, this brings back the family together and heals them enough for the magic to come back. It was putting pressure that was destroying the magic, and seeing that the magic isn't so important relieves the pressure and brings the family together and once they are united and happy again this brings back the magic.

What's the explanation for the magic? They were going for ""magical realism"", a genre typically associated with Latin American literature, especially with Gabriel García Márquez who wrote One Hundred Years of Solitude. That novel is about a man and his family who are the founders of a new village by a river in Colombia. This is what Abuela does too in Encanto, she's the founder of a new village by a river, starting with her family. In the genre of magical realism, there's just magic as part of the real world. Like it's not a fantasy world, it's our world, but there's magic in it. That's kind of every Disney movie already, but I guess typically in Latin American magical realism the characters just accept the presence of magic in the world and there doesn't need to be an explanation for the magic.

But it's a Disney movie so I'm not saying it's magical realism, I'm just saying the story takes in part inspiration from that genre. For instance if you want to make a distinction between magical realism, surrealism, fairy tales and fantasy, it would go something like this... Surrealism is a representation of the human psychological experience like when Luisa sings her song to Maribel and they are transported to a mountain and fly in the sky with unicorn donkeys, it's not actually happening, but rather it's imagination. Fairy tales are allegories for children usually with symbolism to represent the dark things of life and a reliance on folk tales or common stories humans know. Fantasy is when the magical clashes with the real and warrants special attention with the author spending a lot of time explanaining it and marveling at how special it is. And then magical realism is just like the magic is presented as there and it doesn't warrant more investigation.",r0uwz0

I also don't understand your criticism of abuela being mean to Mirabel, and holding the rest of her children and grandchildren to unrealistic standards as some meta criticism of the plot. You understand generational trauma was the entire theme of the movie, right? She was affected by it the most. She literally watched her husband get murdered right in front of her while she was holding her babies. Of course it's going to effect her, and of course there are going to be generational ramifications. That's the whole point of the film. To say, ""I don't like how she's a bit cruel to her family"" as some sort of meta criticism of the film, just seems so out of touch with what story the movie is trying to tell.

hr5sf1x,">Maybe that it's rushed as there's so many characters.

I think this is the film's main problem. Looking at the *Art of Encanto*, the movie's team had originally planned for an even bigger Madrigal family - including a girl, Fuega, who had fire powers; a girl, Princesa, who later became Isabela; and two twin girls I forget the names of, one with the power of revealing beauty, the other of revealing ugliness - but cut them due to time.

However, compared to other Disney/Pixar films, *Encanto* also wasn't given extra time to develop the extra characters that were still kept in the movie. It's comparable to *Moana*, *Luca*, and *Coco* in terms of run time, but all three of those films didn't try to include *all* of the characters' families. Instead, we see focus on a main ""duo"" or ""trio"" of characters - Moana and Maui for *Moana*; Luca, Alberto, and Giulia for *Luca*; and Miguel, Hector, and Imelda for *Coco*. Not so with *Encanto*.

What I think that *Encanto* should have done was to either get an extra 20 minutes of runtime, more comparable with *Incredibles 2* and *Cars*; to get an animated Disney+ series instead; or to cut some of the characters' screen time to focus on three characters at most. My choices would be Mirabel, Bruno, and Isabela or Antonio, with Abuela as as a supporting character.

 (Mirabel, Bruno, and Antonio also feature in [this early concept art](https://imagitory.tumblr.com/post/669134469707546624/scurviesdisneyblog-early-concept-art-for-encanto).)",r0uwz0

hr03729,"I understand why you would feel that way. I mean even the side characters in the film complain about how many Madrigals there are and how hard it is to keep them apart.

To me having such a large family and watching their dynamics is one thing (besides the amazing music, the colours, the animation, the voice acting, the humour and earnesty that are combined here) that make this film so great to me. 

I also think that for such an average Disney movie run time they managed to give each character quite a lot of characterization if you observe them. Especially in the scenes when the family is together, like the breakfast scene where we get to see that there is something putting Luisa at unease, Mirabel is doing her best to save the miracle even if she has to annoy her family for it, Antonio already tries to use his gift to help while Abuela seems to be skeptical about the way he is doing it, while Felix is a supportive Dad,Pepa is angered quickly but hopelessly in love with her husband and calmed by him quickly.

Also the sequence where Dolores tells the family that Mariano wants five babies while giving her a short, but meaningful side glance while Isabela looks like she is about to have a panic attack, but quickly straightens herself up to put on a smile and try to seem perfect again, while Abuela is plucking the one different flower from her hair to make her look perfect again.

That is what I like so much about this movie, all the details it shows and how realistic their family dynamics feel. And for that Mirabel needs to talk to her different family members to get the whole picture and find out what is wrong. So her interacting with different family members makes sense and you see them make their own progresses towards the end of the movie like Isabela finally letting herself be imperfect, bruno standing up to his mother and returning to the family, Luisa starting to realize that she has more worth than just her gift and Pepa who learns that she doesnt constantly have to forceherself to keep a sunny disposition.

Opinions and tastes differ of course, but I just wanted to point out why it makes sense for this movie to be the way it is.",r0uwz0

hqiaxol,"It's pretty crazy how you completely and totally missed the *actual* message this movie was conveying.

Yes, Mirabel was treated poorly by *most* of the family, but the movie showed us that Mirabel wasn't the only one dealing with her own insecurities, anxieties, stresses, and feelings of loss.  She saw Isabela as perfect, but Isabela felt mistreated by Mirabel her whole life, only Mirabel was too stuck in her own world to see the effect she had on Isabela.  And that goes for the whole family.  Everyone was dealing with their own issues and so focused on being the best they could because of the pressures exerted by the grandma that they couldn't express how they felt or allow themselves to be vulnerable.

The grandma realizes this at the end and literally says all of this is her fault for placing too much pressure on the family to be special, forgetting the fact that having the family in the first place is what's *really* special.  But they don't turn her into some simplistic villain.  Instead, we see that her actions aren't out of malice, but her own traumatic life experiences shaping her response to the world.

And in the end, the family comes together to help and support each other, recognizing all of them have value and are special, regardless of the powers.  So maybe everyone didn't line up to apologize to Mirabel, but the main cause of everyone's problems - the grandma - did apologize and own her mistakes.

A movie with a message that tells kids to believe in themselves and see themselves as special even when compared to others, to be open with your emotions and struggles, and to value your family, isn't a movie with a bad message and I'm sorry you totally missed the point.",r0uwz0
hmv6rab,"I also haven't been a huge fan of their recent offerings either! Luca was beautiful but far too light for my tastes, Soul on the other hand tried to be deep but I found it missed the mark completely. With Encanto though, the themes of generational trauma I thought were really great and timely for what I myself am working through.

I totally agree with your points. With the second point, I get what they were going for, especially if you view the powers as just a metaphor for the bond that holds them together so to speak, but I think yeah having them not gain their powers back would have accomplished the same, if not better. Mirabel's door being the front door was perfect already. 

For the third point I also thought the choice of powers was an odd mishmash, but I found a comment on another sub interpreting the powers as different forms of pain due to generational trauma. So the sister struggling with perfectionism, the aunt with emotional regulation issues (weather), hypervigilance (hearing everything), mom fixing everyone, pretending to be what you're not (shapeshifting). And there's the little cousin who actually had a power that he liked and fit him well because unlike the others he had the unconditional support of Mirabel. Clever stuff!",r0uwz0

She saw a butterfly in Bruno's vision and made her realize that she needed to be open and not block a path to hearing someone else, just like she did with her sister.

> And second, I really thought the message was gonna end up being you don’t need gifts you just need family/community…and they even worked together to build everything…just to end up getting their gifts again!!

That was one of the movie's messages, that they are special regardless of the powers.  Them getting their powers back isn't mutually exclusive.",r0uwz0

hueyrvo,"I just finished watching it, and I think Mirabel's ceremony failed due to overall unhappiness of the family. Antonio got his gift due to him being suddenly happy by being next to Mirabel and receiving her support. Kinda like how the house and the candle were fixed in an instant when Isabela was happy due to Mirabel's support.",r0uwz0
huktgmf,Mirabel's Gift ceremony didn't fail. Everyone's gift fits their personality and values and all mirabel wants is to 'make her family proud'. The miracle chose mirabel as the next custodian of magic / the new abuela. It's just that no one understood that's what's happening.,r0uwz0
hulzgc4,"So, fun fact about the clothing of each Madrigal who has a gift (as referenced by a YouTube video I saw after my first watch) has a motif that displays their ""power""
(Isa/flowers, Luisa/dumbbell, Bruno/hourglass, etc). 

To take it a step further, if you look at Mirabel's costume design (even as a child), her ""motif"" is butterflies. Her collar, skirt, she even had a a yarn-like butterfly on her right shoulder. The candle has a butterfly design on it. Abuela's motif is a candle flame. I interpreted it as Mirabel didn't inherit the ""caretaker"" as others have said, she's the NEW source of the miracle, which is why the magic came back when she inserts the doorknob and there's no longer a candle. Abuelo sacrificed his life to ensure the safety and security of his family, which is where the miracle came from. Familial love and bond is the true source of the magic and Mirabel was the only one who took time to learn about her sisters beyond what they can do, ultimately bringing the family back together.",r0uwz0
hukt4g3,"Main answer: a lot of people can relate to the story and the family disfunction.

The fact that there's a lot of people in the family is a strength for others since (1) it's cool to see representation of a slightly bigger family in disney, and (2) a lot of people can see themselves as one of the character.

hukxsm8,"1. The songs contains a lot of the plot and character development. So if you dismissed them, well... 

2. I dunno. I'm asian and i think they did a shitty job with mulan (1998). They put all random asian cultures into a blender and put it all over the movie. i still love the movie but i wouldn't put it as a paragon on how to portray someone's culture in a movie. In contrast, this movie did a very good job in portraying specific colombian things even in song motifs, etc. I learned a lot from seeing colombians review and react to this movie.

3. They mention colombia specifically in the second song of the movie (when they prepared for Antonio's party)

4. The magic being unexplained is another nod to the colombian culture. It's how magic realism works as a genre, and one of the most famous writer in the genre is gabriel Garcia marquez (one hundred year of solitude). In this genre, lore of the magic is not explained. It just is. Plus yellow butterfly as symbol of hope is very ggm. 

5. The whole movie is mirabel learning that she is not the only one suffering in this family and by the end she learned that everyone is hurting and **no one is a villain / antagonist**. Abuela was portrayed to have survivor's guilt. She worked her family hard because she wants to make sure they are worthy of the miracle / pedro's sacrifice. 

Ps: i don't think mirabel is quite abused as harry was by the dudleys. Her family clearly loved her, they just didn't understand how she felt (like she didn't understand how they felt).

6. In the movie, abuela finally opened up, apologized, and changed her ways. I am not sure what more you want them to portray unless you want the movie to be 6 hours long and the last 4.5 hours we just listened this family be in therapy.

7. This is a very complex and emotional story, imho. And iy achieved it without lore explanation (again, following the genre) and without villains. So maybe give it another try with these things in mind?",r0uwz0

Raya, Soul, Zootopia, Wreck it Ralph, Frozen, Tangled, Big Hero 6, all of the Disney Princess Originals, Treasure Planet, Lilo & Stich, UP, Nemo, Increadibles, Monsters Inc, Brave, Atlantis are all better

The only comparable movie is Moana

Moana was better",r0uwz0
hr5ufrt,"White American here. I thought *Encanto* was more comparable to *Moana*, seeing as how Lin-Manuel Miranda worked extensively on both films with the music and songwriting. 🤷",r0uwz0
htfi5vz,"Ah yeah. All white people. Very American view. 

And it's being compared to both Coco and Moana.

And the reason why people from the rest of the world outside usa too will compare it to Coco, is because that's was Disney introduction to Mexican culture for the rest of the world. And Coco also reached global popularity.

But the thing is Coco clearly states where it is, where its from, and explains the culture and traditions well, but Encanto felt very vague. I didn't get we were in Colombia until middle, until my husband googled it, as we wanted to find out where it was set. And he is Latino and yes been to Colombia too (he is not Colombian though). So because it looks very vague and does not really mentions where, what or what it is supposed to represent, lot of people will compare it to Coco because that's the closest thing they have. The film leaves many things unanswered. Why did they run, what time is this set, where it is, what is this magic power based on, why is there magic and so. Coco does wonderful job explaining their culture to global audiences. Encanto felt like a random place in South America. 

I wouldn't mind less songs and more showing the world and their traditions through the characters in it. The first explanation song could easily be swapped for something or someone talking the whole story about the village, to make the place more developed. As all we learned was, they run away from something, they found a magic candle, and that there is an Xmen family getting powers either from the house or the candle. 

I will happily swap the exposition song for a flashback for when the oldest triplet actually got the power the first time, so we see what's happening and learn with them. 

Also I read Marquez books because I love magic realism in literature, but I didn't get it at all this was supposed to be connected to this, until someone said it here. Which is shame because that's and very amazing world to further explore. 

And if it goes other way and a random person in Northern America or Southern of any race can easily feel this confusion about the rest of the world tol, for example differences between various Arabic speaking countries and cultures, pretends Europe is one country, sweeps all slavic countries into Russian sphere and often pretends as if Africa is one country. 

So that's why people who don't have experience with those cultures will compare what's feels similar to them. So Coco. 

So why are you being insulted if people outside of the america or even in, will compare it to the hugely popular and arguably better film as Coco. Film that actually better introduces the culture it represents.",r0uwz0

She probably heard him brought it up and was ignored because it sounds like something a kid could easily imagine after the sudden disappearance of someone close to her.

See explanation of inter-generational from duke University below and it seems like what is exactly portrayed in the movie. 

""Inter-generational trauma is a concept developed to help explain years of generational challenges within families. It is the transmission (or sending down to younger generations) of the oppressive or traumatic effects of a historical event. For example, a great grandmother who was placed in a concentration camp in Germany may have learned to cope by “cutting off” her emotions. Because of this, this grandmother may interact with her family in an emotionally distant fashion. That relationship may be tumultuous to say the least.

The transmission of the historical trauma may begin to negatively affect her grandchildren and her grandchildren’s children, etc., leading to generations of emotional distance, defensive behaviors around expression of emotions, and denial. ""

IIRC, I think apart from Grandma, she is the one having the greatest power to speak and connect to the house itself.

It’s like she is able to glean additional information from everyone in the family. She also has an odd additional ability tied to Casita. Everyone else in the family seems to just live with Casita as an assistant, and can at most recognize how Casita imitates human expressions to talk. It’s only Mirabel who can actually take advice from Casita like she can hear them. The house’s state seems to be tied to her anxiety and stress. When Isabela lets go and Mirabel sees the cracks next to the candle start to close, it isn’t Isabela affecting it but Mirabel’s joy at helping and reconnecting with her sister that repairs the cracks (also literally repairing the cracks of the family).

hr7b75w,"You can be both a victim and an abuser. The two are not mutually exclusive.

Also while there are a good deal of people who will excuse a person's actions because of their past, there are plenty who view it as Mirabel does. Not an excuse but an explanation leading to an understanding of why they acted the way they did and empathy for the feelings that drove the behavior while still recognizing the behavior that resulted was wrong. This is why Mirabel can forgive and then follow up that Abeula needs to be an active participant in fixing what she broke.

I would say that there is a difference between an antagonist and a villain as well. Antagonist basically being someone who challenges the protagonist in some way but mostly causing them difficulty. While a villain is not only an antagonist but is actively setting out to cause harm and trouble for the protagonist or other people. Abuela is an antagonist and she might be awful. But she doesn't fall into villain for me because she isn't malicious enough. She hurts people because she is attempting to help by maintaining control. 

You can argue she's really protecting herself from potential loss rather than trying to protect her family and the magic for the sake of the town. A selfishness rooted in a deep fear of loss. But for me that still isn't enough to push her into true villain territory as the movie plays it that she doesn't realize how miserable she is making everyone and she stops as soon as she realizes that she was the cause of serious hurt.",r0uwz0

hm4mtt8,What?  I know.  I said that she learned her lesson.  I'm just merely stating that it doesn't disqualify her from being an antagonist in the film.,r0uwz0
hrnn5oc,"The reason doesn't justify the cruelty. Killmonger from the Black Panther series went through something incredibly traumatic in his life and thrived by taking up a cause for ""his people.""

I'm not saying Abuela is villainous, or even remotely in the same league as Killmonger, but what I'm saying is that people can have sympathetic origins for their negative traits. Mirabel's internal character conflict is that she doesn't believe herself to be good enough compared to her family, the physical manifestation of that conflict is Abuela, who at every turn reinforces Mirabel's thoughts and feelings regarding her negative view on her self worth.  She is the antagonist because she represents the conflict Mirabel has to overcome to complete her arc.

Abuela going through trauma doesn't disqualify her from being wrong, or toxic, or troublesome to her family, it makes her a complete character.  A complete character that also learns that her behavior, her ANTAGONISTIC behavior, was wrong.  


People can have empathy and still condemn toxic behavior. Your willingness to just dismiss toxicity because of past traumatic occurrences itself contributes to toxic behavior.  Also, your food analogy doesn't necessarily compare, because I struggle to see how  making someone finish their peas compares to the psychological abuse the Abuela puts her family through in the film.",r0uwz0
ht1nlju,Nobody gives a fuck. Having a horrible past doesn't excuse being a POS. Hitler was abused by his father and Chikatilo went through some horrible shit. So? Thank God Mirabel managed to intervene BEFORE she gaslighted her daughter into marrying a man she doesn't love at all.,r0uwz0
hrx8may,"Not just in the family, but the community. Abuela says she’s doing this for her family, and in a way she is (especially after we learn about her past trauma).

It would be interesting to see shorts made of the Madrigals with less screen time going about their day.",r0uwz0
hmgjxkx,"Unfortunately, even with the wonderful magical realism  and redemption here I couldn't help seeing this story in a wider social context. The matriarch's family (with their area-dominating hacienda and control over the town) represent both a longing for a ""simpler time"" and a metaphor for post *La Violencia* consolidation of  land ownership.  It is implicit that the town cannot survive without the family's ""magical gifts"" in the same way that landed gentry (or narcotraffickers) bestow protection and relief on the surrounding countryside.  Here, the pride (and failure to respond to reality) of the matriarch results in the destruction of the house, but inexplicably the townspeople, who have presumably become dependent on the family's largesse, help them rebuild it. Once the peasants have rebuilt the hacienda, the family once again gains power (magic), and once again that magic is retained by the family and not conferred on the peasants.   That is a story that plantation owners (or oligarchs) of many different centuries would find comforting.",r0uwz0

hmbge0i,"I agree the end was too fast, but the fight had to happen after the revelations that Abuela was harming the rest of the family through her expectations. 

Luisa, Isabella, Bruno and Adassa all were victims of their matriarch's designs. That made Mirabel's accusations hit harder because you knew the problem was bigger than just a grandmother disappointed in her granddaughter. 

If the confrontation happened at the beginning of the movie, it would be ""You are hurting ME"" whereas having it after everything else turned it into ""You are hurting OUR FAMILY"". That's the entire point of the film.

But it does get resolved super quick after that. Then again, it would be hard to add much to the third act without it feeling like filler.",r0uwz0
hqn69g6,I think the fact that the grandma did all of her pressuring for perfection without explicitly expressing it most of the time is integral to the film. Generational trauma is often insidious in the way that it seeps into the next generation through repeated subtle actions and a vibe of “this is just how it is.”,r0uwz0
hqohs5d,"This is exactly it. I LOVE musicals but the lyrics in this were just so weak. Hamilton had GREAT lyrics, but these felt so juvenile and basic to me. On top of that, I sort of got the impression that these songs weren’t flattering to the actors’ singing voices? It’s hard to tell. I LOVED the movie, I was just disappointed in some aspects of the music.",r0uwz0
htueinl,"The songs are raging in popularity and I feel like the songs are mostly disconnected from the movie. ""Surface Pressure"" is a powerful song that is completely abandoned by the movie. The song gives the older sister so much characterization and the movie mostly ignores her. There's a lot of depth to explore there and - where is it? I know a LOT of people have misunderstood the movie as the popularity of the Bruno song has confused a ton of non-watchers what this movie is about. Meanwhile, a song that actually has bearing on the movie and on the story in ""What Else Can I Do"" doesn't seem to resonate with people who didn't view the movie, but it's easily the musical peak of the movie, tying the story and the music together (though I have issues with the plot and with this story element).",r0uwz0
hpzzui2,"I'll probably butcher this, but the one of the cardinal rules of musical theater is to speak until your emotions are so big you need to sing them and then sing them until they're so big you need to dance.

hsktihh,"If you ask me, the whole vision thing was out of place. Wouldn't it be more meaningful if mirabel was authentically reaching out to her siblings rather than having it be part of some other end goal?",r0uwz0
hs0vg23,"Even later to the party than you are, but when they had that flashback with young Abuela and she looked so much like Isabela, I wondered if the vision really was pertaining to Mirabel reconciling with Abuela. Like maybe the vision was alluding to something like Abuela needing to remember what the miracle was about in the first place, so it presented her younger self. But I suppose that really doesn't make sense since it's the old Abuela that Mirabel has to reconcile with.",r0uwz0
hrawyh0,"With Frozen, the conflict is only between two people. In Encanto, it is kept a mystery what is happening to the house and Mirabel has to speak and resolve issues with each person to piece together that Abuela is causing the problem. I agree that on first watch the pacing seems off, but due to what they are trying get across, I think it is tough to dedicate real time to each person's internal and external conflicts, which is why each conflict seems rushed.",r0uwz0
htufkib,"My biggest issue is the tensions between family members aren't just solved in a few moments, but INTRODUCED and solved in a few moments. The intro song, which is great, has Mirabel call Isabela the perfect golden child. But she says it lovingly and sweetly. You can't even introduce a little animosity right there??",r0uwz0
hq6ylgf,Same here. I'm really hoping for a sequel because it doesn't seem like we got enough in this one. Hopefully the writing gets better with it,r0uwz0
hrj06qt,"I couldn’t agree more. The first twenty minutes were great and set up such great conditions for an awesome payoff later—Antonio’s relationship with Mirabel most of all. Then Surface Pressure came and I was like “Oh nooo…” It was so incredibly wordy and told us every facet of how she was feeling without us having spent any time with her to make the insights of the song actively meaningful.

And the rest of the film had some enjoyable moments, but was mostly a letdown plot-wise. No Antonio payoff, awful pacing, almost zero believable + meaningful character development, super rushed ending, and the internal logic was inconsistent and confusing, especially about how the miracle works. Very disappointing—I had high expectations.",r0uwz0
hpwztko,"Gosh can't agree more. Honestly I resonated with the songs sang by the two cousins, I love the theme but then it felt kind of awkward? Especially surface pressure? Like wait we're singing now? And yea for the isabel song, did they just end a conflict within one single song???? It felt like most sub-conflicts (weird term but o well) were so rushed and resolved in a minute. I wish there had been more development, and more clues and hints of how they felt suffocated. I love most of the characters, and I really hoped that there had been more story to Dolores and Antonio. (They foreshadowed the Dolores and Isabel Fiancé thing, but it felt so sudden as well?) I absolutely love the theme, concept, character, character designs, colors and visuals. It's just really vibrant. But then its potential is wasted because of the pacing. As much as I love many parts of the film, it's disappointing how the pacing is simply so awkward.",r0uwz0
hqvbio5,I would honestly like to watch a series about encanto retelling the same story but with so much more scenes of the family interactions. Encanto being a movie was probably just too hard to fit in everything that we would want to see of the family.,r0uwz0

Maybe I missed it but I did not perceive that the entire time, which made it hard to care about her big revelation in her song that she didn't have to be perfect.

I was hoping someone with more animation/boarding experience would take over. A writer in charge of a studio in a visual medium has led to…wordy films, which animation shouldn’t be. 

I see some hope, though. Turning Red was far from perfect but showed much promise from its director. Hopefully as Lee gets more experience and more talent is elevated within, we’ll get better films.

Political reasons and ideologies aside, this conflict brought countless of Desplazados, people from rural areas running away of having their homes taken. I was brought up in Bogotá and remember seeing countless of families asking for money on the streets, saying they were displaced from home.

hqcdq10,"I don't think culture is an excuse for Abuela's behavior or actions. I agree that the other nitpicks are silly and culturally different is fine, but Abuela was pretty awful, but in that insidious more subtle and also more realistic way of being abusive.   
It's great that she turned around, but it's also super unrealistic in many many cases, especially since age tends to crystalize our biases and thought patterns. Abuela type people exists in many many cultures. Her ostracizing certain members of the family and being a ruling matriarchal figure isn't specific to Colombian culture by a long shot.   


I think given the rant above and something I felt myself was how quickly she got excused for her actions. If I were in Mirabel's position, I would of run away and at some point I would of thought if this family is so obsessed with itself that it can't see I'm part of it, why should I be here?  
I'm so glad her mother could tell that Abuela was never fair to Mirabel, nor to Bruno, but even she hopped on the anti-Bruno train due to his gift.   


The parallels of dysfunctional and abusive family relationships are very very apparent in the film and it can rub people the wrong way when it hits close to home.   
I'm not Colombian, I didn't have a ruling matriarchal figure, but I could easily see a pretty depressing family dynamic with the ruling figure being 80% of the problem and everyone trying not to step on egg shells and sweep things under the rug for ""the sake of the family"" which is really just for the sake of not upsetting the head of the house/others emotional states. The movie makes it clear that ignoring those and ignoring reality will cause you to lose everything. It took literally losing the house and being told it was her fault for Abuela to realize what she had done, starting with ostracizing her own son for something that was not his fault.  


A lot of people like Abuela in RL would of said that everything was all Mirabel's fault and carried that sad sob story to pass down in the family, which would make things so much worse for future generations, to not be like Mirabel or Bruno or anyone else who was a ""disappointment"".",r0uwz0

hlyc9nv,"Yes I caught that too. She and Abuela basically share the same gift, plus I felt like there were implications that Mirabel could restore the entire house because she was a source of the magic.

Plot twist: it’s Mirabel because she is normal, I felt like I failed 😂

It’s fair to call her the villain of the movie, but the point is that she lost sight of what was important. None of her actions were intending to cause harm. This was a grandma that never got to openly examine the trauma she experienced.",r0uwz0
ic1kpjg,"Dude coming from a household with a similar character like Abuela I can assure you that noone does a 180 like that, specially someone in charge of uncontested decision making in a family. I tuned out after that, this was a clusterf*** of a story. Great animation tho",r0uwz0

hz3xu2b,Mirabel and Abuela’s gift is control of casita. They are the only characters who communicate with casita in the movie. Mirabel is also the only character seen traveling into the other siblings rooms. It’s possible that the rooms automatically lock if it’s not your room or if you don’t have control of Casita. You could also argue that Mirabel‘s gift is the power to bring people together and solve family problems. Each song is a representation of Mirabel’s miracle working fixing for the relationship with Bruno and her sister and her other sister. The final song where they fix the house together is another representation of Mirabel‘s miracle working,r0uwz0

hlzkr8h,"Spot on analysis. Abuela's gift was the candle and the house itself. She's the steward of the magic that granted everyone else their gifts. And now that Mirabel is on the front door, I interpret that as her gift being the same. She's Abuela's successor.",r0uwz0

hqnkal5,I think the message of communal spirit is one that hyper-individualistic American society has a tougher time adapting to.,r0uwz0
hlvck32,"Yes, this is the take I got.  Grandma over-cherished the magical gifts and was obsessed with putting on a good show to maintain the public's reverence of her family and that caused, over time, the neglect of her relationships and the fracturing of the family.  Because the magic was based on the familial bond, rather than being the source of it, it too became a physical representation of that ""unstable foundation,"" which Mirabel explicitly referenced as being renewed in the end.",r0uwz0
hlwnbvc,"The candle which was a meter for the power was fuled by true love like most Disney movies. It sparked from the loving sacrifice abuelo Pedro made, similar to the protection Harry Potter mom gave him when she died.

hlvd9gr,"I thought the point was that the Abuela was the founding of the house and also it's destruction. I think Antonio would *not* have gotten his power if Mirabel did not step in and help him. I think she helped stop the fracturing of their relationship. Abuela wanted everything done perfectly, despite what they might want and I think her own ideas prevented Mirabel from getting her gift. It's not outright spoken but when the Abuela obsessed about ignoring the needs of her family, the family suffered - she suffered as a result. She pushed away Bruno and inadvertently prevented Mirabel from getting her power. Mirabel did what she does best and showed care for Antonio and saved his power in the process.",r0uwz0
hmkbqf6,"I like that they leave it a little vague and up for interpretation. My take is that Mirabel didn't get a power as a way to remind everyone that their powers aren't what make them worthy or special. Her job is to remind to the family (and perhaps the whole town) of what is really important, and she doesn't need magic powers to do that.

i think I had a few issues with the film - we should have gotten and apology song from the family to Bruno. We have an entire song taking about hating him - they could have given us a reprise of all the reasons they loved him.

I have yet to hear them in the movie though, maybe they are fun with the animation.",r0uwz0
hrfidiw,"Sure, but my point was that I thought the movie would have benefitted from opening up the story to include the villagers and having the main character interact with more people outside her family.  I just didn't find the story compelling as written, but I realize that some people love it as is.  It will be interesting to see if Encanto becomes an enduring classic - time will tell!",r0uwz0
hm0h188,That's a valid interpretation. I just feel that it would've been more powerful for them to accept who they are without their powers. That you don't need gifts to preform miracles.,r0uwz0
hmeq5rl,The fact of there being magic doesn't bother me. The fact the movie is incoherent does. The film doesn't do enough to justify the trauma explanation people are projecting onto it. And even if that is the explanation it doesn't explain why the magic cruelly decided to skip one person and at the end still skips that one person.,r0uwz0
hmgx1zj,Nice explanation.,r0uwz0
hme3tt3,"No wonder. I get what u/RoadDoggFL is saying: that simply explaining the magic wouldn't add anything, but like you, I don't believe the film earns the right to have its badly thought-out mechanics ignored.

It did feel rushed at the end, but I don't believe extra run time would've helped. They utilised the running time they did have poorly. Very little actually happens in the first half of the film. A large part of the problem is the songs, which were clearly written separately, emailed over and just thrown in. Most all of them convey almost no information and simply interrupt the flow of the narrative. But the bigger issue is the film simply doesn't commit to anything.",r0uwz0

hme3zg7,"You have every right to leave family that is treating you badly. Replace no powers/seeing into the future with being the gay or mentally ill family member and that ending isn’t so sweet. No amount of personal trauma is going to make up for the near decade of emotional neglect and abuse. In Irl that shit takes years to heal from. You have every right not to stay or not to forgive.

In the context of the movie that almost had me. Maribell needed to go find self worth away from the family before any amount of healing could or should be done. If change wanted to happen baby steps should have been taken and accountability needed to be taken as well for what they did to Bruno. In real life family will most likely never apologize or see the wrong doing of their ways but if they do the victims usually tread lightly because it’s never that simple. Your talking about completely rewiring your brain into thinking your not a bad person.",r0uwz0
hmrdb6v,"But does she have to be nasal and whiny? I liked her spoken dialogue, but the singing….ouch.",r0uwz0
hmflvas,"I completely agree that Mirabel doesn’t need a gift to be special, and I agree that the family was getting prideful and mistreating the blessings each of them were given. However, my point stands that it’s unfair Mirabel’s job gets to be fixing the mess everyone else has created, especially when the majority of the family has given her no reason to help them after how they’ve treated her. 

You’re right that a superpower is superficial when Mirabel is great and important on her own. However, the consequences and implications of Mirabel’s lack of a gift can’t be divorced from her getting a power, so for that reason, her getting (or not getting) one is a problem. While Mirabel didn’t need a gift to make her life better, she did need it to prevent her life from becoming worse. 

At the end of it all I think the depiction of a child holding the entire family together and being the one to solve the adults’ problems for them, and this portrayal being sold as a good and triumphant thing, is just very uneasy, especially when the movie is made for kids. I would hope no child internalizes it and believes that they have the ability to fix their broken/strained home, or that they’ve failed if they can’t. I would also hope no child, in attempt to be like the warm, beautiful, and headstrong Mirabel, believes they should boundlessly love and service family members who reject and/or mistreat them.",r0uwz0

hmcteqa,"Yeah but they should have at the very least apologized to him as well. Because they were also responsible for what happened to Bruno. And I think what bothered me even more about the whole thing is that the film tried to justify what the grandmother did because of her sob story. I mean what happened to her was horrible and no one deserves to go through. But that doesn't justify decades of her emotional abuse to her family. It just really irked me. It didn't destroy the film for me I still liked it, but it really held it back for me",r0uwz0

Like i get it if she would be able to creat illusions or if there was something that had hinted that the environment can change around them so drastically.

Mirabel has an amazing amount of compassion and patience. She didn’t condone Abuela’s actions, but was able to appreciate what she did do right. It is all because of Abuela that they are a family. Mirabel even pointed out there’s nothing so broken they can’t fix **together**. It is such a mature and understandable answer. So many people in the comments are dead set on there being someone who wins or looses. Like there must be someone 100% responsible. Real life doesn’t work that way.",r0uwz0

hun5669,"Ah! That makes so much sense, given how Mirabel revives the house at the end.

Mirabel, he sent me you.""",r0uwz0
hqcckmb,Yup exactly!,r0uwz0
hunwxgx,"The only problem I have with abuela, is thats it was too fast too jarring, everything was resolved so fast. The conflict happened and few seconds later it was already resolved.  about mainly about visual world-building here. I didn't see much of an actual worldbuilding in this film. It was an exotic colorful background for songs and that was pretty much all.

And yes we both listened to songs. The thing is, in screenwriting, you need to show not tell. If you have to listen to song to only then find out whats happening, that means you neglected a very important part of storytelling. The songs cant be your main story driving force, the visual storytelling should be that.

Especially as this is supposed to be a kids film. That means the songs will be translated to various languages around the world, and lot of those things will be lost in the translation. Thats why you need to show it even if there are not songs. Neither in Coco, or Moana you had to guess where it was set, because it took care to explain the history and the amazing culture of that place. This movie ignored that and instead put majority of that information into the songs. And not even that much. Are we supposed to know its Colombia because they drink coffee...

Even Frozen, despite not being a real culture, but inspired by Sami and scandinavians, managed to perfectly explain how the things work. So when you watched you know oh the magic is connected to the trolls, and how its fits into the overall culture and worldbuilding. It uses cause and action. Disney used to make great songs that helped you to discover the world the film was set in.

And if you need to explain in the post, thats why it doesn't work. I read Marquez books, yet I didnt feel that at all. Magic realism is actually one of my favorite literary genres, I even wrote some published essay about comparing it to Russian or SLavic Magic realism. But the things is kids are not going to know who Marquez is. What they will see is, magic candle that gives you superpowers. You wont actually have conversation as this. - But why does the candle do that, mom? I am sorry, honey I don't know, could be connected to Marquez and his 100 years of Solitude...

No shit she was a cunt. That was the entire point of her character.

And by the end of the film, she realized her own mistake, changed herself for the better, and reconciled with her family as a person who now knows better than she did at the beginning of the film. 

So why do so many people watch this kind of character development over the course of a story and come out of it as if they only know the character as they were at the beginning of the story, rather the end of it, which you're supposed to take away from? 

I don't want to tell you how to consume media, but a flawed person learning to become better is a much better sentiment to take away from this movie than there being a flawed person in it in general who apparently didn't do anything else, according to everyone here.

hr98u6t,"The sound of falling sand “shh shh shh” is 3-fold

She can faintly hear him “muttering and mumbling”, a very muffled noise

Second the “sound of falling sand” because his whole ritual involved sand, as did his room

The “shh shh” is also that she associates him with being shushed because when people talk about him, they are silenced",r0uwz0
ht7re6b,I thought falling sand was the salt she heard him throwing over his shoulder.,r0uwz0

""Building a new foundation"" wasn't just about the building, but creating a new understanding of each other and how everyone is apart of the family.

Mirabel didn't have a dedicated room, and she's the only character we see come and go from everyone else's room (Antonio being the exception as everyone was invited everyone in for the party). I agree, her room is the whole house, where ever she wants to go. The house lets her too, otherwise we would have seen it try to stop her.",r0uwz0

hmgqk75,"To be a bit Jungian here, the gifts seem to be a manifestation of the grandmother's wish fulfillment to once again be in control of a situation which had gotten badly out of hand.  The ""gifts"" (which were caused by the death of her husband -- traditionally magic requires sacrifice) allow her to keep her family under her control and to also control the townspeople since they cannot now function on their own. Mirabel is like a family therapist who is stuck inside of a dysfunctional family. By discovering the weak points of the dysfunction (the ostracization of Bruno as refusal to accept the dysfunction) and the lie at the base of the grandmother's power, she causes a breakdown of the family's source of power and a realignment of the family dynamic.  Unfortunately, her realignment of the power dynamic is unsuccessful in this film (as many such attempts are) because even through the family members get to use their ""gifts"" in a different way, they still need the gifts to function and will be dependent on the grandmother and Mirabel. The townspeople are left out of the loop.",r0uwz0
hmg8jh9,"That's what I thought as well. The movie shows that the magic stems from the grandmother's love and protection for her family, so the magic was failing because she started caring more and more about their gifts and what they could contribute to the town and the name of the family rather than about the individuals themselves. Since she's not gonna be around forever it seems Mirabel was chosen to be her successor and the matriarch of the family, so she wouldn't get the personalized room until it was her time to take over as the source of the magic. This is why aside from each person's magic room (since it's their domain), the house seems to interact with and listen to the commands of the grandma and Mirabel the most. It's why the grandma's mood affects the family's gifts and the house and makes it crumble at the end while the other family members can only suffer the effects without their mood actually contributing to the destruction, and it's why at the end when Mirabel becomes the new source of the magic and brings the house back to life she gets the the candle-holding depiction at the front door (like her grandma's room once had) with her family in the back.",r0uwz0

hrlc1eo,"I’m way late to this convo, but actively discussing how much this stuff resonated with my own older sister. We’re all pretty successful by most measures, and we all have crippling anxiety issues that we somehow made it to adulthood without ever really sharing. Then 2020 hit me harder than I expected and I just fucking *broke*, and my family was mercifully there to help me pick up the pieces and get the help and support I needed— and we finally talked about the enormous pressure we all felt and put on ourselves all the damn time that we’d somehow never discussed as kids. 

Getting good marks in school is great and something to be proud of! Following someone who got perfect marks in school…. It almost feels like you can’t even succeed— you can just hope to be *as good as* someone else. It’s expected and demanded it you. Accomplishments don’t feel like accomplishments, they feel like requirements where you have to sprint to stay in place. And all of us struggles with it so much, but kept it inside because we never saw the others talking about it, until it was finally too damned much for me to take and we all finally talked about it. It was a *massive* improvement to our relationship, and I felt like this movie captures so many of those emotions. 

I honestly went in not expecting to like it. I put it on because I didn’t feel well this afternoon and wanted to humor my sister who wouldn’t stop talking about it… and it might be my new favorite Disney movie. Like, god damn— Up is good, but this was a decent chunk of one of the most formative bits in my life…. Somehow perfectly encapsulated by a family of Colombian women with magic powers.",r0uwz0

hsj9x36,"The characters are def on the nose, but I kind of accepted the family the way I did the emotions in Inside Out. When I stopped thinking about the Madrigals as individuals and instead as a unit, it made the story work really well in my head.

ht8qoc6,"Yes agreed! And “living with open hands” goes perfectly with Mirabel getting a cut on her palm from the house’s broken tile. 

It can be risky to live life like that, and you can get hurt, but it’s worth it. She’s undeterred by the cut - it even encourages her to start her journey to help her family/house. 

The cut is Mirabel’s proof that the house is really falling apart. No one believes her (and she wonders if she dreamed it too) since the house heals itself periodically. 

It’s also fitting that the house’s wound (broken tile) immediately hurt Mirabel since she’s so connected with the house (re: various theories on this).

Haha I keep thinking of more. There’s so much symbolism to unpack in this movie!! Just watched yesterday and loved it.",r0uwz0
hq9hbte,"I don't think it was a ""my bad"" moment, I think she realized that in the same spot 50 years later, she wasn't alone. She didn't have to shoulder a huge responsibility and not just take care of her three infants, but the community who relied on the miracle as well.

She thinks to deserve it, the family needs to use their gifts to benefit the community, and she fears the magic (and therefore her family's safety) is going away because they are somehow not being good enough to deserve it.

Of course they built them a new home. When their power returns each villager regains their high quality of life.

The villagers get free healthcare money couldn’t buy. Broken arm? Fixed. One lady just needs to spend her days in the kitchen making magic food for you and you are all healthy forever.

The villager get free labor equal to an entire construction crew and day laborers. Need livestock rounded up? A building wall fixed? A whole building moved? The granddaughter will do it for the equivalent of some shared food, while singing a song about how she works all day without a break doing any and all labor requested.

The town has physical security from outsiders from the magic. They’ll never suffer from a drought because of the magic.

They wouldn't be able to function, so they're at the Madrigal's mercy essentially to be able to live? That doesn't seem cool."" 

I'm glad they have a nice supportive community and all, but of course you'd try to be when there is so much concentrated, dynastic power, right? Literal power at that! Just, um, not the greatest message among all the other lovely ones, lol.",r0uwz0
hqbu4f4,"I was really hoping that since the magic spread through out the town when the Casita (sp?) came back to life, that the magic was also to the whole town, not just the ruling family (class). 

I agree that it's highly idealistic in that way and not at all applicable or desirable to real life historical and even current context. It's a great point to be made though. 

I get that the excuse is genetic though (which is SO much worse in real life context) because it was like the fathers sacrifice and kisses he bestowed before dying were what gave her the miracle. The candle was if anything more symbolism for his sacrifice and hope to lead the refugee's out of a dark time. Because only kids related to Abuela directly and her 3 kids could get their own special abilities.

Now that I think about it, it was Abuela, but also the whole family shunning Bruno, literally one of Abuela's children, one of the gifts from her husband that probably started the chain.   
Malleable foresight would be an amazing gift, so long as it isn't fate based, IE if you know x or y could happen, you could change it.",r0uwz0

htuf7sr,"I have issues with the visions. What are they? The fun of stories of stuff like the Oracle of Delphi is how they can be interpreted differently, but when the interpretation is wrong the vision STILL comes true.

These weren't the case. You can make the argument that Isabela's prophecy comes true, though no one promised her a future where she's independent. But if being independent is the life of her dreams, and her power growing represents learning to make something new, that comes true. But Dolores's prophecy of the man of her dreams always being out of reach doesn't come true. It blatantly doesn't. You COULD argue that the prophecies no longer come true when the power goes away, but the movie doesn't make that case.   


But the song and the plot of the movie are separate, which is another weakness.",r0uwz0

Super late but just wanted to point out that in the intro at the very end of the song when the kids are asking Mirabel what her power is and she’s just trying to distract them by re-stating the rest of her family’s powers, she does actually some some animosity towards Isabella. It was very quick and subtle but when she’s talking to Mariano (Isabella’s ex- fiancé) she says: “Look, it's Mr. Mariano, hey, you can marry my sister if you wanna (Mirabel)
Between you and me, she's kind of a prima donna
Yo, I've said too much and thank you but I really gotta go.” 

That prima Donna line is the first hint that behind the artificial happiness and union they have there’s clearly discord and tensions within their family.",r0uwz0

hpz914x,I don’t think the Isabel quickly ending the conflict is problematic. I feel like no one ever really tried to ask her what she wanted. What flowers did she like? What did she want to grow? Mirrabella is the first person to ask her family members how they are feeling. Everyone (family and the town) assumes the gifts are awesome and everyone is happy.  No one checks in to see what everyone wants to do and that they are ok. They must be because they have these cool powers. Mirabella takes the time out to talk to them about them.,r0uwz0
hr3nkg2,This would have been a perfect one season series. So many interesting characters with fun powers and the dynamics between the family could be fleshed out and then the resolutions would have so much power (although I still think it should either have ended with the whole town getting powers or the family losing it but being happy).,r0uwz0
hrqqi9x,Abuela just keeps talking about how Isabela will marry that guy from town. How he's coming to propose. How they will have babies and continue the family. No one ever asks Isabela if she even likes him.,r0uwz0
hsmzwq3,"I think Isabela llooked a bit uncomfortable when talking about the marriage (could just be me) and in her scenes the ""perfection"" felt a little too forced and fake (once again could just be me). Plus when she sprouts those flowers on her head, abuela only picks out the white one (the only one that is different from the others) which I felt symbolise trying to make her perfect. I feel like telling someone something has to be perfect is pressure in itself. About the plants, they are prickly and cause messes so they arent typically seen as pretty abd perfect as they arent always pleasant.",r0uwz0

That was my biggest issue with this movie. It had a great setting and story but I felt like every time a song started I was pulled out of it. It just didn’t fit the style for me and really felt like the musical songs were almost clashing with the rest of the instrumental soundtrack that fit the Columbian environment. They weren’t bad songs by any measure, they just seemed like they belonged in a different movie.

hmd8fle,"Hi, I’m also colombian. My great grandparents were displaced from their honey farm in the 1930s and violence still continues in colombia. There isn’t just one given period of violence. My mom lived through the violence of Escobar and drug cartels in the late 80s. There were many kidnappings and killing of prominent people in journalism, government, etc. Look into former presidential candidate, Ingrid Betancourt. She was kidnapped by FARC for 6 years for calling out corruption in her policies. Many farmers have been forced out of their lands for many decades in colombia. Violence and extortion still continues to be prevalent, even though the FARC has been technically disbanded.

EDIT: I’d also like to add that, displacement of rural communities still exist to this day. Extortionists come into rural properties and demand money “or else”. They have no choice but to pay it to stay alive. Sometimes these people need to flee their land and hide elsewhere in fear of being found.

ht0n53a,"right?? like they mentioned no problem with her being a matriarch, they problem was very clearly the way the movie failed to address or hold her accountable for her issues",r0uwz0
hwqxsi5,">I think given the rant above and something I felt myself was how quickly she got excused for her actions. If I were in Mirabel's position, I would of run away and at some point I would of thought if this family is so obsessed with itself that it can't see I'm part of it, why should I be here?

The inclination to run away does get shown through Bruno by him choosing to remove himself and how it did nothing to stop the dysfunction from continuing in his absence (although it did give the rest of the community a break from what they felt were negative prophecies) 

Somebody HAS to stay and have the tough conversation rather than removing themselves. Mirabel did eventually run but fortunately she kicked off the necessary verbal confrontation beforehand when no one else would - accompanied by the fall of the house. 

I also don't see it as Abuela being quickly excused since in her mind, her trauma from 50 years prior started to repeat itself as soon as those cracks began showing up early in the movie. All along, she was deeply tormented in her own psyche by the threat of being displaced again along with keeping herself in mourning all those years. Mirabel got a glimpse of the fear her grandmother never shows while hiding underneath the window. Yes, she had become used to keeping up appearances and maintaining status, but those are surface symptoms. Underneath that, she was terrified of more loss. Acknowledging our elder's trauma the way Mirabel did at the river is such a huge part of healing generational issues. I learned the hard way, you absolutely cannot go in with guns blazing, expecting accountability. The very idea that so many people feel Abuela got off too easy and her family should've made her suffer longer/harder is exactly what makes them defensive and gaslight us in the first place. They expect that if they even allow the conversation to begin, they'll just become a whipping post, so they shut it right down. 

I know first-hand that once you have that hard talk with the right delivery, you have a much better shot at accountability. Finally hearing someone own up to their shit can also lift a lot of weight immediately, allowing forgiveness to move along pretty fast too - especially if the love outweighed the transgressions. Not everybody deserves that effort just because they're family and I know Abuela's actions felt familiar to a lot of us, but this particular character was not intentionally malicious. Her fears & grief caused her to cling too tight to a certain picture of her family - the lyrics of Dos Oruguitas. I'm glad they showed that it can be done.",r0uwz0

So as far as I'm aware, colonization has nothing to do with it.",r0uwz0

hmh1u8i,"You've got a real criticism about the theme, but your beef shouldn't be with the magic. Magic isn't supposed to be coherent, it's magic. If it were coherent, it'd be science. It's there for exactly one purpose: to show outwardly and concretely the things that are happening inwardly and abstractly. It does that fine, the problem, as you pointed out, is that those things are themselves somewhat contradictory and not fully fleshed out.",r0uwz0
hpbjqc5,"Yes I agree exactly. The movie never really felt like it was going anywhere until the sisters hugging vision. But then that never really developed. They just sung a song and that was it on the sisterly relationship. 

Then there’s the fight with abuela and mirabelle and I thought mirabelle was going to go somewhere to get answers but she never did… all that happened was mirabelle and abuela had a talk by the stream. 

Then the town rebuilt the house and I didn’t really get why. Abuela says that the family helps the town but we never really saw evidence of that except for the strong sister moving buildings around and the mom healing them.",r0uwz0

hlve95o,"All they really did was serve others and I get that was the point, that they didn't get to do what they truly wanted because of Abuela but I think that spending the entire movie in the Encanto removed a little bit of the mystery of the world they built. I would have been fine with just a little bit more if they didn't spend as much time on each family member.",r0uwz0
hlzn8ba,"I thought that the climax would be her getting a power or something else after the house shattered. I didn't think the entire conflict was the house only but no, to answer your question. I didn't think the movie was just starting 2 hours into the film.",r0uwz0
hr13zko,"To be fair, the film is paced very strangely. It feels like there’s constant climaxes",r0uwz0
hm22tpu,Your reading comprehension is garbage if you think I can't wrap my head around how a children's movie ended. I was disappointed that the resolution happened so quickly after the climax if anything.,r0uwz0
hlw8fz5,"The issue for me is her treatment towards mirabel herself. She tells her to stay out of the way thinking she can't help and acts like she was unwanted ever since mirabel didn't get her gift. She then rushes into pinning everything on mirabel. I actually thought she would be the twist villian. 

So her emotional moment and redemption didn't feel earned for me. That was the only real issue I had with encanto though",r0uwz0
hm6zax5,"I feel like every relationship beat was incredibly rushed. Mirabel tries to talk to each sister, they sing it out, and everything's fixed. And they did a bad job of showing her parents sick up for her to abuela. But I just figure that's a constraint of the format. They only had ~90 minutes to do everything and did well, imo. Might've enjoyed it more as a show, but I'm going to cherish this movie for many years to come.",r0uwz0
hmt20kq,honestly i think abuela should have had a song at the end when discussing her trauma and the whole family needed an apology song for Bruno.,r0uwz0
hmefc6o,[removed],r0uwz0
hsp5nzl,100% agree.,r0uwz0
hmgvjnz,"Yeah. I mentioned to my wife that this is really, really, really not a film for younger children.  It places the child as responsible for fixing the family dysfunction -- even when that dysfunction seems to consist of magical gifts. (Think successful siblings with low empathy and high narcissism.) It's a realistic situation that many children face, but the fact that Bruno had to flee because of his powers of foresight and Mirabel felt responsible to resolve the situation at the risk of her own life is very, very dark.",r0uwz0

hq0cgwn,"Very much so. Mostly done with calculations and physics. I took cgi classes in the early 2000s and I know it has advanced a lot since then, but cloth has always been a pain.

Most clothing you see in animation are Polygons modeled woth the character. They just are part of that character unless a specific moment is needed to make it move or snag on something.

With Encanto, it is clear they made actual cloth layers and cloth physics to her outfit. That way it interacts with every single movement - how it can move around and bump into her legs, twirl and move with gravity and spin.

It is an insane amount of calculating power the programs use for clothes. It neefs to interact with the gravity set in the scene, with the character's movements, with the character's body parts, and with itself.

Look at Frozen. Their clothing moves but no where near to the level of fluidity of Encanto's. Elsa's dress folds and moves from her legs...but is still pretty stiff. All their clothing is minus capes.

In frozen 2: the biggest cloth movement is her huge cape at the end but everyone else still wears very stiff looking outfits.

See how much you notice how little clothing moves now in older movies. It will surprise you.",r0uwz0
hmrdkwf,Sorry and then changing her behaviour thereafter would. Old people can get redemption too. I do think they should have shown her doing better at the end.,r0uwz0

hqjp89m,"You don't know me or what I've been through, so don't presume to know my childhood, family life, or upbringing. I didn't do that to you and would expect the same in return.

And I didn't say the message was only about a family bond, so I guess you miss the parts where I talked about insecurities, stresses, anxieties, repressed trauma, etc. and the importance of being open, seeing value in yourself, etc.

Your takeaway from the movie was that it glorifies abuse. That's literally what you said. The filmmakers clearly didn't intend that nor was it actually what happened on-screen. The abuse that Mirabel suffered was portrayed negatively and we were supposed to understand she wasn't being treated fairly. In fact, the movie also showed how other family members had pressure placed on them by the controlling grandmother and how it negatively affected them. Nothing about it was glorified.",r0uwz0
hrnvnnx,"Just a confusing take, I had trouble finding songs that weren't dream sequences lol",r0uwz0

hu4f9y9,"I'm looking it up, seems like it can also be ""listen""? Can be commanding, like a scolding parent. I mean that fits with Abuela getting everyone's attention. Apparently similar to the British ""oy"" or closer, the Portuguese ""oy""",r0uwz0
huoo1gi,"> thats it was too fast too jarring, everything was resolved so fast.

it was the start of reconciliation. she saw the error of her ways, apologized, changed her ways. what do you want them to show? 6 hours of therapy sessions with all members of the family?

&#x200B;

>The thing is, in screenwriting, you need to show not tell.

that's the confusing part to me. they also do this. the songs were used to highlight characters feelings and motivations which is staple Disney and all musicals. what more visual storytelling are you asking for? The movie is about (mis)communications and family dynamics and i feel like they show a lot of growth throughout the movie. Dos Oruguitas is a masterclass in show not tell. every member's facial expression throughout the movies. I don't understand how you can't see the plot and character development being shown clearly in the movie.

&#x200B;

>Are we supposed to know its Colombia because they drink coffee

no, we are supposed to see their dresses, the song inspirations, the buildings, the yellow butterfly, etc.what do you want them to show you to let you know they are in Colombia? what makes you know where moana is set? or Coco? i feel like the movie the exact amount. it's actually more specific than moana's general oceania / pacific islands vibes.

&#x200B;

>But the things is kids are not going to know who Marquez is

then i don't understand this need for lore dump. i don't see how that candle is magical is less valid of an explanation of ""the magic is connected to the trolls"". it's magic. it's a gift to protect the family. family rifts threatened the gift. perfectly clear to me.",r0uwz0

hoc7sxn,"No, or rather her power was to build the house. That’s why there’s so much resonance when Mirabel’s power ends up being to rebuild the house Abuela destroyed.",r0uwz0

hro4411,"It's because her redemption was too quick and abrupt and as a result was hard to accept for me and many others who have had family members like her. 

I mean, she changes from miserable, narcissistic hardass to loving grandma over the course of a single montage? Look, trauma *explains* why certain people are awful but it doesn't *excuse* shitty behaviour - especially the kind of behaviour that lead to one of her own sons being ostracized for a decade and all of her grandchildren suffering in different ways. 

At the end of the day, it's a kids movie so it's not really a big deal and we can accept these ""love heals everything"" heel face turns that way. However, if you want to picture these characters as ""real"" people then, no I just can't buy Abuela's ""redemption"". It wasn't earnt and it was way too quick. The film generally had some serious pacing problems and the grandmother's transformation is the worst offender in this regard.",r0uwz0
hq0w0z9,"Her redemption was immediately forgiving herself after treating Mirabel like shit and Ostracizing her son so bad he hid in the walls. During the last song of the movie she STILL has the audacity to sing “it’s not perfect”. 

Maybe I just don’t think her transformation was believable, at all. She was immediately forgiven, and she immediately forgave herself. Indicating the producers didn’t realize just how toxic and damaging her character was.",r0uwz0
hsohazv,"The redemption only happens because it’s a Disney movie. There was no logical road to it, she gets worse and worse throughout the movie. There’s no positive growth and she didn’t do anything to deserve the redemption.",r0uwz0
hqnhdjd,"Amen, plus you see her backstory of having to cut herself off from the rest of the world to save her people from violent attackers and then losing her husband in the process. Abuela is deeply traumatized and wants to control everything so she doesn’t lose everything. It’s not good or right but it’s understandable.",r0uwz0
hspjnrz,"There's a [Folding Ideas video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URo66iLNEZw) that I keep coming back to, about how subtext is dead.

Channels like CinemaSins have completely destroyed most people's idea of media consumption by turning it into this fixation on the most unimportant, surface level details.

And we see it the most with a movie like Annihilation where people take an ending where the entire significance of the ending is what it *figuratively* represents, and yet a bunch of ""film critique"" channels proceed to ""explain"" it completely literally.

So people look at Encanto and go ""Abuela was in the wrong, she's the villain"". Like no, she's a flawed person. Like basically the entire family. She had trauma, and wasn't able to heal so was now smothering her family by trying too hard to keep them safe. Mirabel forced her to confront this, and she snapped out of it... but she was bad so her growth is irrelevant",r0uwz0
hqta0te,"You are right, the movie told a good story of redemption for the grandma.

I think most people are looking at it as if it happened in real life. Because if the grandma was a real person and she treated her family bad. Just because she realizes that and wanted to change doesn't erase the lifetime of abuse. A person can't just have a change of heart and everything will be all right.

But this is just a Disney movie for kids, and people seem to take it way too seriously.",r0uwz0
hty98w2,Well the movie opens with the backstory. I think it was more supposed to be a more in-depth reflection of how terrible that is and how much trauma that would leave someone with to go through that and how It gave her such a strong fear of losing everything again,r0uwz0
hqpmx8u,Yeah it’s hard. We’ve had to make some hard boundaries. I haven’t cut them out completely because I know it would make my wife sad but definitely had to establish some boundaries. It’s hard coming to terms with the fact that the people who should be your foundation are causing you the most pain.,r0uwz0

hrx7e67,"Yes, and we’re saying they didn’t do a good job of it. Just because Disney says “this is when you’re supposed to forgive her” doesn’t mean it makes sense. Abuela alienated half her family for years and we’re supposed to accept that? No thanks!",r0uwz0

She even sings ""It's like I can hear him now, I can hear him now"" later in the song.

I can only speculate as to why she chose to keep the fact that Bruno still lived in the house to herself. Maybe she thought it was best for the family if they didn't know.",r0uwz0

Again, I wasn't comparing the two, I was just demonstrating that a traumatic past does not absolve you of shitty behavior in the present. You can't go through something terrible and use that as an excuse to treat people poorly in the present, which is EXACTLY THE LESSON ABUELA LEARNS IN THE MOVIE.  If your grandparents went through something traumatic, I genuinely feel for them, but it is also up to them to be aware of their behavior and whether or not they are negatively impacting others because of it. It isn't your grandparent's fault for what they went through, but it isn't the fault of anyone they are treating poorly either.

We don't see the lasting impacts of the damage she caused, we don't see real evidence of her even changing, no one ever even addresses what Mirabel said (about how Abuela is the reason that everything was breaking) right before the house collapsed.

The movie presents this message that abuse is just excusable, that people do it out of love and that if you show them the truth they'll understand and change, and that's just not representative of real life.

Her song should be about how she feels unappreciated and like a physical work animal. But instead it's about how she holds all the families burdens. But she doesn't! The family is super happy! The house is super big and free! Everyone is smiling and getting along! The town loves them! She has never shown any cracks before that scene. You gotta foreshadow stuff. 

It's an island. Her appearances for the rest of the movie follow it, though I feel her complete emotional breakdown is also the opposite of the song, but at least they're not ignoring it.",r0uwz0

hrvw4h5,"But, at the same time, the story starts in media res. We don't see Isabela falling for the guy because the story starts presumably after that. We don't need to ask Isabela if she likes the guy because the story starts at a place where we assume she already does. There's no indication she's unhappy until after the cactus, well into the movie already. 

Honestly, most of the character revelations felt really forced because the movie never really made any indication until the songs that were really just exposition.

As to your point about Abuela, that just feels natural. For example, I just moved and whenever my grandma speaks to my mom, she's always asking about how I am and how she's proud and whatnot. Abuela being excited for the marriage doesn't really come across as pressure until we hear the song. I agree that the pacing of the movie was really off.",r0uwz0

I think what offends her though the most is people who think they have OCD just because they are neat freaks or are super organized or A-type. She has a coworker who says this about herself all the time and my gf finally snapper at her abd told her ""unless you have these intrusive thoughts that constantly interfere with your life abd make it difficult to control abd get through the day that requires you to take medication and weekly therapy then you need to shut the hell up. You don't have OCD, you're just a neat freak. It's not a cute thing to say about yourself because I wish everyday I didn't have it.

But there are people out there that are beyond it. I'd say if it all depends on how they respond to the confrontation.

Abuela's intent was always good. We know that, but what she understood thankfully is that intent doesn't mitigate hurt and hurt can happen and most often does with out intent. 

A too far gone toxic person won't be able to recognize or struggles massively beyond the ""But I didn't mean to"" portion of the thought process and it kind of doesn't compute past that. Or worse, the denial comes immediately with a ""How dare you"" thought train and laying on blame by calling out the accusers faults. A real life person with Abuela's hard past who struggled and worked to keep the family safe, but had ultimately been causing it to internally fall apart could easily be in the ""but I didn't mean to"" camp. I think a lot of people here have unfortunately known that type more often than the ones you have met. Not all broken people realize that they need to pick up the pieces and instead try to break others to not be alone. It really varies which one someone might be dealing with. That all said, I've also learned in my life that it's not my job to fix/help other people realize these things when even if they are a person who could change with a lot of hard work, it's not worth it to set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. 

It sucks that people in families with toxic qualities and people feel a need to stay in it or find it their job to make it function even a little. A relationship goes more than one way.

I also thought Mirabel bore some striking resemblance to her dead grandfather and wonder too why the movie didn't clarify that connection because the correlation is that Mirabel is a protector, just like her grandparents, which is why she is able to bring the magic back becos she looked past her own pain to help others, just like Abuela at the start of the miracle.",r0uwz0
hmgwcb9,"> She has the power to ""reconfigure"" the magic because she has no illusions and has the power of having survived humiliation and despair to be able to confront the lie.

Exactly! And linking her with her grandfather and his sacrifice empowering the magic (which Abuela then misuses becos her grief blinds her) is so important because Mirabel, like her Abuelo, also makes a sacrifice. 

She puts herself aside to minister to her other family members and ease their fears and anxieties, or, like with Isabela, she helps them *bloom*. 

Mirabel's selflessness thus helps the family recreate the miracle in the first place but she is the originator of the miracle - like Pedro - because her selflessness binds the family back together and the house recognises her sacrifices made for those she loves.",r0uwz0

An ""I want"" song is the signature song of a main character usually sung towards the beginning of the movie that tells the audience what the character's deal is and what they want.

So songs like Part of you World, Reflections, Go the Distance, True Love's Kiss, Almost There, Just Around the River Bend, How Far I'll Go etc.

Frozen is a bit different since there are two main characters who share two songs since there is a giant time jump that are sort of do the function of an I want song. Being Do You want to Build a Snow Man and For the First Time in Forever. I would argue though that Frozen is Anna's movie and that For The first Time in Forever is her ""I want"" song since we get to know her and what she wants but Elsa's wants are not communicated only her fears.

Moana had a very lush, choral sound that gave me nostalgic vibes of 90s Disney movies, whereas Encanto definitely feels like LMM got more leeway to draw more from modern pop and Broadway shows that use smaller orchestras and more electronic influences. As someone who has no clue how to truly judge the quality of music, I'm unsure which is truly ""better"", and if you stripped all the songs down from both movies to lyrics and piano backing tracks I'd probably be able to compare them more easily.

It wasn't until his vision that abuela cast him out, but he was mistreated long before that. I just really didn't like that it was just brushed off with what they did to Bruno. Abuela though, certainly was the worst offender especially because she was ready to just do the same thing to Maribel. But the rest of the family, including her own parents didn't seem to care. When they took that family photo, they all left Maribel out not just abuela. No one cared. But I never really felt like they were redeemed for what they did to both of them.",r0uwz0

I will, however, stay by my opinion that Abuela's tragic backstory is a weak explanation for her behaviour (plus, showing it in the third act makes it feel like 'we need something to make Mirabel forgive her'. Very rushed.). Yes, she might've realized the error of her ways, and yes I know it's Disney and their messages are sometimes watered-down, but the movie presented real situations that affect a lot of people in a superficial manner.

After a whole film of mistreating people, the film chooses to portray her as someone who is perhaps more deserving of sympathy than our main characters. At least, this is very much how it felt to me, regardless of filmmakers intentions. My girlfriend who I watched the film with also thought this. 

I enjoyed the film but it really feels like at the end the grandmother gets a pass for mistreating her grandchildren. It was very unsatisfying. Bruno does not get an apology after a decade of estrangement and vilification. The grandmother gives a single apology and tells her tragic backstory and Mirabel forgives her.

She and I have a great relationship now where she was the villain in my story. 

There is a lot of context and nuance you are missing. This was so relatable to many colombians, because of the generational trauma, the overcorrecting and being strict in order for your children and grandchildren to not feel that same trauma that they end up being the root of other traumas. 

My grandma finally understood that loving too much to the point of suffocation is also not healthy, but she lost her mom, her dad and her husband to violence so I learned to understand why she was overprotective, rigid, and strict.",r0uwz0
hu5eq5d,"Everyone has reasons for acting the way they do, that’s a given. But not all reasons are good reasons. In the context of a Disney movie, the ending is fine. But of course people are going to bring their real lives into it, because everyone has a different life experience.

I’m a Latino who grew up in a similar toxic environment, in which traditional culture and perfection left over from my parents’ trauma resulted in mistreatment of my siblings and I. My parents both had very difficult lives, and it’s understandable that they acted in the ways that they have, but it’s not necessarily morally permissible to cause unjustified and unfair pain on their children simply because they were hurting deeply. My parents are still responsible and culpable for their actions, much the same way the abuela is, even if there is acknowledgment and apology. 

The Disney movie is a caricature of very real issues, which unfortunately do have far-reaching and often lifelong consequences for people who suffer under their own version of the abuela.

It’s not a matter of seeing things as black and white, but a matter of seeing that an apology does not always provide an exemption for a lifetime of abuse and control. Being abused by people, even if they’re well-meaning, still fucks you up pretty badly.",r0uwz0

EVERYONE treated him badly. More specifically, everyone was unhappy with what he told them regarding their futures to the point he got sick of it. It wasn't just Abuela's fault.

>Maybe I just don’t think her transformation was believable, at all. She was immediately forgiven

Because at the end of the day everything Abuela did *was for her family too*. Yea she went about it in some terrible ways at time but her intentions were good. Her family was fed, prosperous, living in a nice place, protected and they had a good bond with their community. 

So yes, the family, most specifically Mirabel who witnessed her past events, forgave Abuela because she figured out why she became who she is.",r0uwz0

“Los realizadores quieren agradecer a la hermosa gente de Colombia. Cuyas tierras, música, familias, historias, y corazones nos inspiraron desde el inicio, y seguirán inspirándonos cada día.” 

Which translates to: “The filmmakers want to thank the beautiful people of Colombia. Whose lands, music, families, stories, and hearts inspired us from the beginning, and will continue to inspire us every day.”

hr7dpf2,"My chosen interpretation is that magic was involved in that quick turn around. After all, the reconciliation was set to a song singing about the miracle involved in massive transformation after a separation and then they were surrounded by a swarm of butterflies. And she is behind Mirabel on the casita door suggesting her place now is to take queues from Mirabel.

 Or that they probably discussed some deep things durring the multiple month it took them to rebuild their house. She was shown actively helping in fixing the house even though she's like 70 and prior to this the only chore she did herself was sweep some flowers and facilitate other people's labor or activities. 

Or it could just be that, as a group they are really good at forgiving in the context of having come from a matriarch that lost everything and having experienced a shocking but small taste of the same when family discord cost them their house and powers. 

Another option is that rebuilding and dealing with crisis has a way of making some people put aside psychological grievances until the storm has passed. And there will be talks and stuff right after the party is over.

I would hope, that if people in real abuse situations watch this movie and it sets unrealistic expectations. That the unrealistic expectation would be the expectation that once the abuser is told how they are abusing they should put actual effort into changing right away if they love you. And hopefullly if the abuser doesn't do that, the abused will reject the abuser because they didn't measure up to Abuela. 

I know I was jealous at how well once shit hit the fan Abuela accepted responsibility and seemed to listen to Mirabel.  Which only drove home that the person I was comparing her to didn't actually care.",r0uwz0
hrupdyb,"I'm super glad Mariano is just a himbo and not Hans 2.0. 

I don't think it would add anything to the story if Mariano was surreptitiously transgressive; for instance, if Mariano was secretly a bad guy, it would suck the tension out of Isabella's desire to not marry him and make Abuela look ridiculously villainous. The pain of her decision is that Mariano is just a normal hunky dude - but she's simply not attracted to him and is marrying him due to the pressure from Abeula. 

Interestingly, Isabella was once going to have a secret boyfriend who was everything Mariano wasn't (scrawny, weedy, short) and the fact she had her own hidden love was going to be the thing she was putting on hold in order to please Abeula. I'm glad they didn't go this route because again, it would sap a lot of the tension out of her character motivation and kind of devalue her within her own storyline.

Also, Mariano just being some handsome villager puts Dolores' power in perspective. We don't think of it as functional to the community in the way say Luisa's gift is, but without her power she would have never had a way of falling in love with him.",r0uwz0
hud64mi,"He mightve felt the same way for all we know. Just putting on a show, like isabella. When abuela says do something... you do it. its even more true if youre 'just a townsfolk.' That family is getting a chance to marry their son into the wealthy family. (Its magical, not money, but thats probably even worse.) 



So maybe the poetry dolores heard was about her? IDK. If not, them the above still replies, just in a depressing ending for mariano: dolores gets what she wants, so does isabella, and so do marianos parents, in a wedding to a madrigal.",r0uwz0
hrunuuk,"Did I say they were shit? No.

Pepa for instance is an endless source of resources, she could start a fire with a strike of thunder, provide endless fresh water through rain, introduce refrigeration to the community by generating blocks of ice and snow. If anything, because Isabella could take over farming Pepa is being misused.

When it comes to pure function, Luisa's strength, Pepa basically being the Avatar, Isabella and Julietta provide for the wellbeing of the community far more than Dolores and her brothers.

I agree Antonio's gift is novel but it's not something the community is dependent on to be self-sustainable the way Julietta's cooking is.",r0uwz0
hsetr07,"I find a lot of the lyrics to be bare or repetitive. 

Where You Are to be lyrically weak song. ""The island gjves us what we need and no one leaves"". Okay. ""We make our nets from the fibers
The water is sweet inside
We use the leaves to build fires
And cook up the meat inside""

The water is sweet inside what? Without the visual it's not great. There's no link here in the surrounding verses to explain what's sweet about the water. It's there to rhyme with inside and nothing else. 

I like How Far I'll Go but they repeat the lyric 'island' and ""line"" a lot. 
""I know everybody on this island
Seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island
Has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine""

""What's beyond that line?
Will I cross that line?
And the line where the sky meets the sea
It calls me"".

htg6iwx,"Definitely. I do believe that it's this mystical effect that's missing in LMM songs. Like whenever I hear his songs, it'll always remind me of Hamilton or just a mere creation of LMM.

Compare that to the songs from Disney Renaissance where you can feel the setting where the movie was based on, there's the lack of fantasy missing in his works with Disney. His songs just felt.... like it's created for this modern age.

He’s eating a little now and went to bed early, no longer in any pain. I’m relieved it wasn’t COVID or something worse. My nerves are wracked at this point.

Norway is the only country with a Sovereign Wealth that hasn’t be stolen by corruption (unlike say Dubai sovereign wealth fund which was inspired by Norway). Denmark is so famous as being a great country that it became a meme in development economics for countries to “get to Denmark” in terms of Human Development Index, Corruption, etc.

If I'm honest, I think Mirabel's ""I want"" song is the main reason I feel a bit underwhelmed. It's supposed to be the iconic song of the movie, like Moana's How Far I'll Go. But Waiting on a Miracle just doesn't do it for me.

But I genuinely like Surface Pressure, Dos Oruguitas (just a shame it's not sung by any of the characters), and of course We Don't Talk About Bruno.

Of course, having Beauty and the Beast totally in French would not be a Disney movie, so the next best thing would be to have a French accent, like Lumière in the original movie.  Not so much as a caricature as Lumière, but a subtle French flair would be nice.

It would be like if in real life there are two siblings and one is a talented athlete and the other isn't.  Maybe the talented athlete gets more attention from the parents and no one notices the other kid is special too in a different way.  But then the athletic sibling is injured and realizes their athletic talent didn't define them and their sibling had things that were special about them too, just no one could see them because they were too busy with athletics.

Alternatively, Abuela was essentially manifesting CPTSD and OCD-like rigidity and perhaps felt that The Gift had certain requirements that she had to uphold otherwise she'd put it at risk, hence the high levels of perfectionism and pressure she put on other members of the family.

hspdp55,"Meh, I started looking through the lyrics of various Disney movies in preparation for ✨big reddit counterargument✨ but honestly it's not really a big deal lol. 

In summary: I see what you're saying, but the examples you picked seemed to be more intentional as a repetitive literary device vs. lazy songwriting. Other songs in Moana have lyrics that objectively *slap* (esp compared to Disney predecessors), and although I haven't seen all the recent films, I do find them to have more memorable/meaningful/thought provoking songs on average. I grew up during the ""Renaissance"" so all those soundtracks are obviously dear to me, but if we remove nostalgia from the equation, the repetitive ""I need/I want/I am/etc."" songs and themes do seem pretty stale.

I think LMM's influence also plays a huge role here. Dude writes absolute bangers, yet it usually takes me a few listens to get past the subtle cringe of overly-straightforward lyrics and pop/rap/musical mashup. Your examples are def reminiscent of his writing style, and considering he practically dominates the industry these days I get where you're coming from!

She's perfect but she doesn't want to be totally perfect, but removed from the burden of perfection she's even more perfect. There's gotta be a better way to handle that. I also dislike in the Bruno song when she's randomly rude to her sister who has never done anything to disrupt her so far. It's out of character. If she's supposed to be perfect she can't be the one who's being rude. Earlier in the movie in the first song when Mirabel sings she's the perfect golden child, show the resentment in her. Like, Mirabel is the person in the wrong here. She should overcome her resentment towards her sister, and in doing so helps her sister learn she doesn't have to be perfect to be accepted and to relax more.

That's the point. Tho I'm not insinuating that you need the help of a US company to represent yourself/country, but you're being very hostile for no particular reason other than what I assume to be a petty rivalry between Latin American countries.

hm1hlqd,"You know it's pretty easy to paint the entire company as a cold, heartless machine, but there are two sides to the entertainment industry. You have the business people that want to make the most money, and you have artists that want to tell the best story (and there are other sorts I'm sure). Often times, the people that pitch these ideas are the creatives who have to convince the executives to go with their ideas.

I have no doubt Disney thought a Latina protagonist might be profitable. I don't think they would have made the movie otherwise. But I also don't think it's necessarily true that they did it to ""check a box."" I think the directors just felt inspired by Colombian culture and wanted to make a movie set there, and they were able to convince Disney to let them. I mean the movie has to be set somewhere, right? Why *not* Colombia? The only thing that really matters, artistically speaking, is that the setting serves the story, and it definitely does (particularly Abuela's backstory and the way the family operates).

Edit: So it turns out it was Lin-Manuel Miranda's idea to set the movie in Latin America. After the success of Moana, they brought him on again to make another movie, and he's the one that pushed for Latin America.",r0uwz0

It's like when Elsa says ""Love thaws"" at the end of Frozen and ended the eternal winter, only I think Encanto actually sets it up way better by giving Abuela time to reflect on the truth bombs Mirabel dropped on her followed by a lovely heart to heart scene at the river. And even then it took a montage of hard labor and a song about the family valuing each other as people to bring the magic back.

(I'm guessing she knows he is still in the house but can't admit it.) She then constantly reinforces Mirabel's inadequacy through condescension and dominance over Mirabel's weak but loving parents.  Once Mirabel resolves the situation at the risk of her own life, the grandmother is never punished but has a miraculous change of heart which everyone accepts without reservation. The magic returns, with no consequences for the grandmother who is rewarded by having the townspeople help rebuild the home. And so the toxic cycle continues.",r0uwz0

The song should have been no one cares about Bruno, because that was truly the case. Come to think of it, I think they should have done a reprise of the song from Bruno's perspective and that is what he sings. But the fact no one seemed to care, is all the more reason why the ending didn't land or sit right. They didn't care that he left, but now they just all of a sudden love him again. I just don't buy it. I think the movie needed more focus. It would have been better to dial in a bit more on Bruno feeling cast out and Mirabel (since she relates very well considering the family is basically doing the same thing to her) perhaps could have brought him to live with them again and the family has to go through this internal journey together to see Bruno isn't the villain they think he is.

 On one side, there's this shinny, breath-taking wonder full of landscapes and smiling faces; you need to be either a tourist or part of a minority who can afford such lifestyle to contemplate this standpoint. On the other side, there's  poverty and violence.

 What causes violence? I think a considerable factor is the overwhelming social inequalities spread in the country. Just to give you an idea, more than 50% of the population earns no more than a minimum 1.000.000 pesos salary ($246.25 USD) while congressmen's base salary is 34'417.000 pesos ($ 8.475.34 USD). 

Social inequalities bring up dozens of underlying issues such as deficient schooling, poor sexual practices, drug abuse, etc.

Your opinion is your opinion, but the cultural significance and the nuance of it which is why this movie surprised many Colombians (who had given up on Hollywood even researching our food accurately), in a good way. 

Regardless of the opinion of the abuela, it is still a good story of how generational trauma works and how there is the opportunity for it to be passed down a little bit less each time with communication and opening up about our feelings.

hqze88e,"Never said that abuela was justified in how she treated Mirabel.

Abuela doesn't treat Mirabel the way she does because she doesn't have a power, she treats her that way because she associates Mirabel with her fear of losing the encanto. Her not getting a power was foretold by Bruno. Bruno also had a vision that Mirabel would be at the center of the destruction of the house. She constantly fears this and Mirabel is just a reminder of what's likely coming.

They weren’t going to listen and Dolores had no reason to believe they would.

She probably would have just let Mirabel solve the problem of where to put herself the moment Isbaella got pregnant on her own as well. And since Mirabel was Isabella's whipping girl, Isa would have encouraged it.

It’s one of the last Disney films I felt was complete and came out when it was ready, not because it had to. It gets a thumbs up from me.

While Abuela does fear her family and community falling apart, this is still a 5 yo child we're talking about (when Mirabel's ceremony took place). Abuela's treatment of Mirabel implies that she has no need for someone without a gift in her family because it makes the family appear weak, and that Mirabel's presence is sort of tolerated; her other relatives don't treat Mirabel like this, which makes it even more humiliating for the head of the family to shun her like this.

hx3wsqe,"Think about the implication.  At the beginning of the movie, Mirabel tells us ""but let's be clear, Abuela runs this show.""  All along, it has been Abuela who rules the roost, who is the unspoken authority.  There was no proclamation of such, she simply assumed the role and the people around her assented to it. Because of the candle and the sacrifice she bore.

She led them to a new home of peace and safety. She led the building of the original *casita*.  She kept vigil over the candle.  And prior to Mirabel, she was the only one of the family without a gift - she didn't *need* a gift because hers was the role of the overseer.

Fifty years later, the next Madrigal without a gift leads the way.  Mirabel has borne her own sacrifice.  Different from Abuela's, but Mirabel is traumatized and long-suffering in her own way.  Like Abuela, Mirabel puts the good of the whole ahead of her own happiness.  (Yes, Abuela does this, even if it's not easy to see on the surface).

Further, Mirabel, like Abuela, is keyed in to the health of the candle and the life of the casita as bound to it.  It's not a coincidence that      giftless Mirabel was the one who was *explicitly* shown that the magic was failing. And it is *Mirabel* who, like Abuela before her, leads the restoration of *home* when the candle is relit.

hus5zxd,"The lyrics are exactly the same when they’re repeated. Why would they be in reference to something else?
To me it’s repeated because the whole song is about how everything stays the same. So after Moana has her moment where she considers the world beyond the island, she’s swept right back up into the rhythm of her family and tribe, right where she was before she went to the water’s edge with her Grandma. And then that leads her into deciding (until a little later in the movie) that she’s going to stay and embrace her role as chief. So it’s a repetition choice that makes sense to me.

It’s also odd to me to criticize a lyric being (slightly) unclear without the visuals in a song that was specifically written for a movie. But I see below that others do consider whether it works outside the movie to be a characteristic that defines whether the song is good, so I guess agree to disagree on that?

And I try not to be a dick to someone unless they’re arrogant first, and deciding something written by someone as widely acclaimed as LMM is lyrically weak without actually paying attention to the lyrics, and declaring so in a condescending tone, seemed to qualify.

I don't fault the siblings as much, even though they certainly didn't help. But the parents could have and should have done more. Her dad was basically not even a character. And how abuela treated her and the entire family was unacceptable. The parents had to of seen the constant emotional abuse from the grandmother and seemed to have no problem with it. If I were them I would told the grandmother that we are leaving, if the meant losing my special gift, so be it. It's better than continually having my daughter subjected to how she is treated here. She basically got the Harry Potter at the Dursleys treatment at that house. She was completely ignored and set aside. And Bruno got even worse than that.

hqzk9ss,">I wanted to point out that just because Abuela did what she thought was good for the family, doesn't mean that all that she did was actually good.

I never said all she did was actually good. Just that she did do a lot of good for her family and her community.

>While Abuela does fear her family and community falling apart, this is still a 5 yo child we're talking about (when Mirabel's ceremony took place). 

But Abuela didn't treat Mirabel poorly immediately after she didn't get a gift? I don't remember seeing any scenes of her being treated poorly when shes growing up.

>Abuela's treatment of Mirabel implies that she has no need for someone without a gift in her family because it makes the family appear weak

Thats not even true. Her stressing the importance of a gift doesn't mean she doesn't care about Mirabel.

>and that Mirabel's presence is sort of tolerated; her other relatives don't treat Mirabel like this, 

Except they do? Watch the beginning of the movie. Multiple characters point out that she is doing too much, likely overcompensating for having no gift. 

>And I feel like that's a weak point in the ending: it was wrapped up hastily with a little bow on top, as if years of being shunned can be handwaved with a hug.

Years of being shunned? Again, did we ever see Mirabel growing up and being shunned? No we didn't. We saw a moment in their lives where people were at peak stress and anxious about an impending end to their way of life.

The movie starts with Antonio's party being set up. Everyone is worried about him getting a gift. Especially Abuela.

I think what people seem to forget is that Abuela doesn't just put a lot of pressure on her family, she does to herself as well. She is constantly focused on everything going perfect. From Antonio's ceremony, to Isabela's proposal. To a point where is in straight denial of whats happening in the house.",r0uwz0

Alma is meant to represent the harsh abuela/grandmother that a lot of us know (hispanic or not honestly, harsh heads-of-family span across most ethnic backgrounds), and she IS harsh. it hurt her when Bruno left, and because of everything she’d already been through, it hurt less to harden her heart to him rather than face that pain. she lost her husband, then she pushed away her son. maybe it’s a hispanic household thing, but when you’re small your words often hold little value. i can’t tell you how many times i heard “she’s telling stories” in reference to myself.  you have to think about the amount of pain Alma was already in. she knew Bruno’s prophecy, it terrified and broke her, she’d already lost her love and now the home they’d been gifted was dying according to Bruno. i’m not saying that makes her choice to shun him okay or rational, but i AM saying it’s not as heartless as you may think in your gut reaction. the whole family was emotionally devastated when he disappeared, think about how they searched for Maribel! when they couldn’t find Bruno (because he never really left), they couldn’t talk about him anymore. it hurt. and imagine young dolores, hearing him but knowing her mother weeps for him? i don’t know that i’d have said anything either.

hqzuwax,"I find it hard to imagine that Abuela only showed disappointment when Mirabel was 5 and then suddenly when she was 15. I found some clips, because I couldn't remember the exact quotes. These show that Abuela had treated Mirabel noticeably differently from other members of the family since Mirabel's gift ceremony. Just because you aren't explicitly shown more doesn't mean you can't infer it from context clues.

[https://youtu.be/odQU2\_zLW4w](https://youtu.be/odQU2_zLW4w) \- note the side-eye at ""some of us"", and telling Mirabel that she's essentially in the way, instead of giving her something else to do (because Mirabel clearly wants her approval and to help out); Abuela just cringes at Mirabel's clumsy attempt at a gift instead of just smiling politely about it; in comparison, look how supportive Julieta is with Mirabel (probably wanting to compensate for Abuela's distant behavior). Later in the clip, Julieta says ""mama, be nice to Mirabel, OK?"", implying that Abuela is usually ""not that nice"" to Mirabel.

[https://youtu.be/ukynXbG\_gfY](https://youtu.be/ukynXbG_gfY) \- here, near the end of the clip, Abuela calls everyone for a picture, yet doesn't notice that Mirabel isn't among them. Sure, that's not deliberately excluding her, but she doesn't notice her missing either.

[https://youtu.be/i-moX4PVT5k?t=242](https://youtu.be/i-moX4PVT5k?t=242) (around 4:02) - Julieta says to Abuela ""mama, you've always been too hard on Mirabel"". The Abuela states ""Mirabel was in that vision for a reason."", implying that she's always resented Mirabel for supposedly being destined to bring misfortune into her orderly family.

I never said that Abuela hates Mirabel or doesn't care about her. I said that she cared about Mirabel *less* than she did about the family members with gifts/powers, and treated her differently not just because of that, but because Abuela thought that Mirabel would bring disorder into her family.

>Multiple characters point out that she is doing too much, likely overcompensating for having no gift.

But they don't treat her negatively, they appreciate her effort and realize that she's looking for approval from Abuela. They sort of feel pity for her because they see Maribel's efforts wasted.

I do agree that Abuela's efforts to control everything and have everything be perfect is detrimental — after all, it's what caused the house to crack and the magic to fade in the first place.",r0uwz0

Then Abuela says, ""the magic is strong! And so are the drinks (wink)"" that could hardly be more obvious that Abuela is trying to play off the very negative interruption by Mirabel as some made up delusion due to drunkenness.

The whole movie aside, if your kid was at a party and everybody was drinking, and they suddenly said something outlandish and upsetting like ""the ceiling collapsed in the kitchen!"" but when everyone goes to look, the room is completely normal, you'd probably feel some social pressure to play it off as your kid being drunk and ""seeing things"" rather than people think your kid is just crazy and hallucinating, which also reflects poorly on you as the parent (at least, in some cultures).",r0uwz0
