gzpxr9j,"I think that Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds did such an amazing job. The fear in Noah’s eyes once his character realized that his leg was stuck in the bear trap...you could almost tell the exact moment where the pain really kicked in after the shock. That was the only scene that made me audibly gasp in the theatre. I’m so impressed with their performances, and I would almost watch an entire movie with just the two of them",nmnxqu
gzpx3lq,Love that the movie was not afraid to show the monsters. They were not just dark blobs jumping out from the shadows to eat people.,nmnxqu
gzpy0io,I thought they did the Day 1 scene really well. Especially showing the slow panic once they noticed the meteors. I could see that exact same chain of events happening in real life.,nmnxqu
gzt6mtk,"One thing that really bugged me is that the creatures dont know how to swim and yet our military somehow still lost the war??

What about Hawaii, Japan or other island territories?? Are they having Sunday barbecues while mainland people eat each other?",nmnxqu
gzpq837,Loved the audio and camerawork in the opening attack scene...the contrast in character POV and escaping was really refreshing,nmnxqu
gzychtz,"My favorite thing was when the monster jumps in the water at first I thought

""Oh God it can swim""

And then the MFer just drown LOL",nmnxqu
gzrtxgy,"Noah Jupe deserves all the praise for his performance.

Specifically, when Reagan said she was leaving. He went through every single emotion with just his face. Same when his Mom said she was leaving.

He did NOT want anyone leaving him (for many reasons) but you could tell, over them all, he just didn't want his Mom or Sister to die.

Bravo, Jupe.",nmnxqu
gzvhf7a,"Has anyone mentioned that one kid with the deadest expression ever on the island?

No fear just vibes",nmnxqu
gzpyiom,"This was everything I wanted from the sequel. I loved the first sequence because I had wanted to see how everything started, and I also appreciate how significant those moments were for the rest of the film.

I felt sick when Marcus got caught in the bear trap because he's such a sweet character. Don't really understand why he left the bunker though.

I totally thought it was about to end when they found the island and that it would be nice and hopeful but nah. I really liked the ending though, they chose the perfect music.

Overall I thought it was actually better than the first one, really cool and special. Exactly what I want from an alien/monster movie.",nmnxqu
gzpq5m3,"Djimon Hounsou got rekt lmao. Poor guy.

The movie ended kind of abruptly but it was a solid sequel. I’d keep watching these as long as Krasinski is still making them. So much tension and such great use of sound.",nmnxqu
gzq5x8m,I don't know why but the opening outbreak scene gave me legit goosebumps. Something about the way it happened felt uneasy and felt a sense of impending doom,nmnxqu
gzr0i4e,"Also, in what world did folks ever imagine Jim from The Office would go on to be an action star in his own series and direct a film that grossed hundreds of millions of dollars worldwide?",nmnxqu
gzq6riy,"The callback of Cillian/Emmett signaling Reagan ""dive!"" gave me the chilliest chills in a movie recently.",nmnxqu
gzpwae2,What was with Scoot McNairy on the docks? Great actor and he didn’t have a single line. Overall I enjoyed it but I found that to be so weird.,nmnxqu
gzt2pd6,"They need to put a boat on the water with no one in it and just blast music from it. Aliens jump after it and drown. The end

Or just put a beats pill on a pool noodle lol",nmnxqu
gzpqycx,"I loved the suspense too but man, those chaotic scenes were so nicely done. The monsters running around destroying people was awesome! Loved how the monsters and the destructions are always in the background too — I could REALLY feel the main chararters’ panic and fear!",nmnxqu
gzq10of,"I really wish Cillian Murphy was in a few more horror movies. Great in 28 days later, solid as scarecrow and now this. Something about this face, specially his eyes that makes his characters relatable. 

Also, did anyone else got the Last Of Us vibes when they were moving towards the island? Overall, a solid 7.5/10 and looking forward to the last chapter.",nmnxqu
gzpzz7f,"I also never realized that the names of the characters were never disclosed in the first movie. If they were, then I definitely missed it. I loved how subtly Krasinski’s character’s name was revealed in the beginning, and how Jupe’s name was revealed in such an intense moment. It really brought out Emily Blunt’s disparity as she was trying to calm him in such a suspenseful situation",nmnxqu
gzraes5,"At some point or another I felt like I was watching Aliens, Stranger Things, Wrong Turn, and the Last Of Us... But that's not a complaint. Absolutely loved this movie... Even more so than the first one. Haven't been to the theater since the pandemic started but I had to see this in imax on the big screen. 9/10",nmnxqu
gzq5m04,"Time to stock up on hearing aids. You never know when the next alien invasion will be. The kids are the heroes of A Quiet Place Part II, but the unsung hero of both movies is the hearing aid.",nmnxqu
gzucqau,"I've only been watching movies and TV with subtitles on since the pandemic started, so it was hard as balls understanding the whispers in this movie back in theaters without captions.",nmnxqu
gzuelrn,"Chapter 1: Evelyn gets a nail in her foot

Chapter 2: Marcus gets a beartrap to his foot

Chapter 3: Reagan gets her foot blown off by a landmine (?)",nmnxqu
gzupp2u,I liked watching the monsters absolutely smash the fuck out of groups of people lmao,nmnxqu
gzpqfa9,The most interesting thing to me about the prologue was the tactical advantage that the family had from the start by already being able to speak sign language. It’s something I never considered but of course that is part of the reason they survived in the first place.,nmnxqu
gzsx9du,Noah Jupe is gonna get everyone killed more than that damn baby 😒,nmnxqu
gzpqizg,"That hearing aid has racked up quite a kill list so far, looking forward to it taking out an entire planet of these things in part 3",nmnxqu
gzq152s,"this is kind of obvious but I really appreciate how Noah Jupe was directed to scream so much after getting caught in the bear trap. I’ve noticed in a lot of horror movies that, when the stakes are so high, the characters suddenly have such unrealistic reactions to certain things (such as pain). In this case, the stakes were extremely high, but Jupe’s character still screamed uncontrollably even though it could’ve gotten him killed in seconds. That’s because a bear trap fucking HURTS. he shouldn’t be expected to have the ability to shut up like Blunt’s character did in the first movie after all those contractions and the nail. I’m glad that he was able to let it out and make the audience realize that his character really is just a kid.",nmnxqu
gzy66wj,It was oddly satisfying to watch Cillian stab that crazy guy to make him scream to his death.,nmnxqu
gzq0ae8,Did anyone else have major LOST flashbacks when they found those homes on the island? Totally took me back to the village of “The Others” . Felt like it looked practically the same,nmnxqu
gztnodb,"One minor detail I loved was in the prologue, right when John Krasinski sees the first alien crash into the store in front of him, he immediately turns around and starts sprinting. No hesitation, no moment to process what just happened, no tripping and stumbling, just 0-60 without thinking. I always hate how clumsy characters act during scenes like those, so it was refreshing to see someone so collected for once.",nmnxqu
gzpqjt9,The opening sequence hits different after the pandemic. John Krasinski is just going about his business when he sees something about China on the news. Next thing he knows sports are cancelled and then people start dying.,nmnxqu
gzpr6yl,"Loved it. Even more suspenseful and beautifully shot than the first one.

Kinda ended abruptly though",nmnxqu
gzppufh,"All of the shit that happened in the warehouse could have been prevented if the kid had just stayed in the damn cellar. I mean look at Djimon’s kids. They followed his shit without any questions... despite that, very good sequel to the trilogy

On a separate note, there were people talking during the movie about the scenes and what was gonna happen to some of the characters. There were some very audible gasps when the son took the baby’s oxygen.... I really missed the moviegoing experience",nmnxqu
gztagam,"Part of me wonders if John Krasinski regrets killing himself off in the first one, not considering that there might be sequels. 

You could have had him slide into Cillian Murphy’s role with some very minor tweaking and the movie would have been basically the same. 

Not taking anything at all away from either movie, as both are very good, but that was a just a thought I had.",nmnxqu
gzvskkb,"So one thing about the whole “the aliens can’t swim” thing...that doesn’t automatically mean they drown either. 

These things came from space, seemingly on a big ass meteor, so it’s not as if they need to breathe in order to survive. Which means there are a lot of then just chilling in bodies of water unable to figure out how to get out.",nmnxqu
gzpr34w,Did anyone else expect Emmett to be a villain?,nmnxqu
gzq3vb8,"This was everything I wanted from A Quiet Place sequel. I liked the first one, but I truly loved this one.",nmnxqu
gzptsxt,"That fucking bear trap, man. John Krazinski is wrong for putting >!Noah Jupe!< through that. All of that aside, those kids can act. Loved the film.

Edited to add Spoiler tag!",nmnxqu
gzs88ec,Man after watching it all I could think about is Cillian Murphy should be the one to play Joel in that Last of Us series.,nmnxqu
gzpqkpj,"I will watch Cillian Murphy’s eyes in anything. Solid movie once again. It felt great to be in a more packed movie theater experiencing the silence and intensity of a movie like the first one was in theaters.

 8/10 Bravo",nmnxqu
gztrini,"A) I really loved being back in the theatre. I ate my weight in popcorn. 2) really enjoyed this movie. Like other users have said, the beginning scenes and scenes of chaos were fantastic. And finally, my favorite part of the first was the unknown and the anticipation, that wasn't there for me, but still really liked this one.",nmnxqu
gzy6zpg,[deleted],nmnxqu
gzprr1b,"Really loved this one, more than the original I think (which I just rewatched before seeing this).

It gave me MAJOR Last of Us vibes the entire time and I really liked how it built off of the first movie. My favorite part was the kids finally taking charge and being able to defend their families when the parents couldn’t, something Lee tried to instill in the first flick.

Overall loved the tension, atmosphere and clever use of sound throughout. My only gripe would be the interaction with the savage people. Would have loved to explore that more and it was the only aspect that felt like a shoe-in apocalypse movie moment.",nmnxqu
h0ah97h,Wow reading this thread really killed my buzz. The modern day criticism has just turned into pointing out plot holes and trying to outsmart the film. Film is art and the world in these films is not our own. We don’t bitch and complain about the “realism” of paintings or music or many other artistic endeavors. Try meeting a film on its terms and not yours.,nmnxqu
gzq5vif,"During the dock scene, did anyone else see that one of the aliens seem concerned about the one fell in the water? Thought it was interesting because so far they’ve been pretty much “seek sound, destroy sound”",nmnxqu
gzpq551,"There’s just something that I love about seeing the “normal life” before everything goes to shit in a disaster movie, so I loved the Day 1 scenes.

Overall probably not as good as the first, but still very enjoyable. They definitely left it open if they want to make any more content in this word. Interested to see what happens...",nmnxqu
gzq75j3,"What depresses me Is the fact that even if they truly eradicate the creatures from Earth, dogs no longer exist. The creatures just killed off man's best friend. My heart sank when I saw that poor German Shepard in the truck 😢.",nmnxqu
gzpqyec,"The opening scene was pretty fantastic, however part of me thinks it should have followed Emmett and his family, with the Abbott’s being background characters instead of the main focus.  Then we’d jump ahead 2.5 years and spend a little time with Emmett as an alone and broken man before he reunites with the Abbott’s. 

But overall, I think I actually enjoyed it more than the first, even though that stupid white board makes a brief cameo.",nmnxqu
gzpylx7,"When Cillian Murphy finally caught up to the girl and agreed to help her, my first thought was ""holy shit its The Last of Us.""

The movie was pretty good. I wish we got a little more of a conclusion and some more backstory of the aliens' origin but I guess its a trilogy so maybe we'll find out in a few years.",nmnxqu
gzq1htv,"I thoroughly enjoyed it, only seen it once but I like it better than the first. It builds on the characters, more so the kids. 

The first one sold me on the premise and I enjoyed it for the movie it was but there is a bit deeper stuff going on in this one and had more exhilarating scenes. That bear trap and the cutback and forth between the three scenarios going on at the same time, was excellent",nmnxqu
gzpqtcy,Did John Krasinski shoplift those groceries in the beginning of the movie? He literally grabbed a bunch of stuff and said “I gotta go” while everyone was busy watching tv.,nmnxqu
gzq4678,"I'm mostly okay with this movie, but why in the world did the people from the island play ‘Beyond The Sea’ as a message to come to their island rather than just recording a message that explicitly stated: “We are living safe and happy here on island X. Also, the aliens can’t swim. Use that to your advantage I guess.” 

Like, do the island people want other survivors to come to their island? If not, don’t broadcast anything at all. If they do, why in the world make it so needlessly cryptic?",nmnxqu
gzqshrl,"Was there a reason the islanders decided to make their broadcast a code rather than simply a message about getting to safety via islands? Were they really worried about overcrowding over a year into the apocalypse? And wouldn’t nearby radio listeners know that station was an island station from the before times, rendering the mystery of it all moot? It seems a little too cutesy. Otherwise loved it.",nmnxqu
gzu781t,"Great movie, but just thought it was funny how they also (out of the main characters) made sure the black guy died first. They fulfilled the trope, nice.",nmnxqu
gzq3cst,"Rusty nail 🤝 bear trap 

Causing the plot of both movies",nmnxqu
gzq88h8,"Seeing day 1 was really great, but I think it creates a small plot hole with the first one, which had newspapers left out explaining how the creatures hunt and what to survive. Doesn't quite add up that a newspaper would get delivered in the an area that was basically ground zero.",nmnxqu
gzpqnr0,I wasn't sold on the idea of the sequel but after seeing it... Yes I will 100% see a 3rd.,nmnxqu
gzsywy9,During the scene where Regan had to get into the recording(?) room and there were sooo many objects that she could’ve slipped on/knocked over had me on the edge. I kept waiting for something to fall LOL,nmnxqu
gzpr6rn,For some reason when Cillian Murphy was on that gazebo near the end he was giving me MAJOR Joel vibes from TLOU,nmnxqu
gzqb61v,Someone in the theater sneezed during the movie and got everyone KILLED,nmnxqu

gztdspt,"What a performance by rickety cricket, come a long way since IASIP",nmnxqu
h37mdtr,"really can’t get over that everyone in this movie is just dumb as rocks. 

Reagan just HAD to go to the island that very moment? it couldn’t wait a few days or few weeks until her mother and brother healed from their wounds?

Marcus just HAD to abandon his little brother to go exploring? never mind everyone else has already left? exploring the factory was something URGENT he needed to do that very moment?

Evelyn just HAD to leave to get medical supplies without briefing her son properly? can’t be bothered at ALL to tell him the oxygen’s depleted?

all the events that drive the plot of this movie is really seriously stupid it distracts you from everything else. 

Also, Djimon Honsou should’ve been Emmett instead.",nmnxqu
gzpq4bh,"Overall, this is more of the same. Good quality tension and great use of sound to make your blood pump. 

Krasinski is really good at continually using sound in clever ways. I liked how we were switching perspectives using sound. The lack of when we're following the daughter and that moment where we hear the water like the creature hears it. All very well done. 

Also telling us what we need to know without too much dialogue is done well here. I like how despite the fact that the people at the marina don't say a word, we know exactly how awful they are. The way he makes certain items/images stick out in our mind without the use of a constant soundtrack is really cool as well. 

Plot of the movie is generally more of the same. Just trying to stay safe in this world. Cillian's character had an interesting arc of learning there are people worth trusting, but what I really liked was how Krasinski's character still comes out through his kids. The ending is basically them being as brave as their father and I thought that was a great way to make his presence felt. 

I'd give it a solid 7/10. On par with the first, maybe a little lower considering they gave Djimon a criminally small part.

/r/reviewsbyboner",nmnxqu
gzpr7yy,How did that creature get on the island? It was shown to be on that boat and that boat somehow drifted to the island?,nmnxqu
gzq6kx5,"Just left the theater and here are my thoughts:

What I liked:

-	Loved the opening. Was glad to see how things started and boy did it escalate quickly. No time wasted. 

-	Cillian Murphy’s character Emmett. He did an excellent job of filling the John Krasinski void while not overtaking his character. This is clearly a man struggling to maintain what little faith he has left in both survival and humanity, and clashing with the family who are trying to keep faith and hope alive makes for an interesting dynamic. 

-	I thought the island quest was really clever and helped develop some world building and story progression. Gave me some Last of Us vibes. 

-	I really enjoyed the touch on the dark side of humanity. Emmett mentioned it in the beginning and it paid off well. We don’t find out a single thing about these people but it’s clear that they too are trying to survive but willing to do much worse things to get there. 

-	The arrival at the island. Hope lives once again, Emmett struggles to accept it but looks like he finally does...up until he doesn’t. 

-	The sound. This is to be expected if you’ve seen the first but I thought they did it even better in part II. Going from silence to sound was really suspenseful and the surprise sounds were really well done without being over done. That bear trap was B R U T A L in both sound and visual. 

-	The ending. Powerful moment watching them step up and protect those who’ve protected them. Dad would be proud. Thought it was shot in a really clever way. 

What I didn’t like or wish we got more of:

-	I wish we got some more info on the monsters/aliens. The opening did a decent job of teasing us on where they came from but I wish we got just a little more about them, something, anything at all to add to the world building. 

-	Building off of my first point, the monsters/aliens now feel very one note. We get it, we understand them. So now every situation with them involved feels familiar and the suspense kind of suffers for it. 

-	Why did Noah feel the need to go exploring? Did I miss something? Was he after something specific? Or was this just cabin fever getting to him. This took me out of the movie a bit, like you’ve got a busted leg that needs serious treatment so you’re just gonna climb a ladder and go for a walk, putting everything at risk? I just didn’t understand this part at all. 

-	The monster arriving on the island. This felt extremely lazy to me. I can suspend my belief as much as the next person but this was a bit much. I can accept the monster developed a fear of water and stayed on the boat, but accepting the boat *drifted out of dock all the way to the island*? Highly questionable. 

-	The sound. Goddammit does this movie make it tough to eat my popcorn. Every time I throw in a handful the movie goes silent and all that’s heard is my ***crunch***. I tried to time it as best I could and failed miserably. 

Final thoughts:

Enjoyed the movie overall. Was a fun watch with some great moments. There were parts where I felt like I was watching the first one again but here’s hoping we get a part III and we can really work on the world building and story progression while getting the rest of the family to the island.",nmnxqu
gzuhwck,I think the attitude of these monsters is very intriguing. They’re literally just obliterating anything that makes sound. They’re obviously hypersensitive to loud sounds and high frequencies. My girlfriend suggested that they just hate sound and want it to be quiet. I had a hard time thinking of a better alternative.,nmnxqu
gzwdco8,"A small detail I loved was how multiple characters referred to Day 1 as “that day.” Most survivors probably faced intense loss on that day and it makes sense there’s such an understanding when they talk about it well over a year after.

Another detail I liked was how everyone’s feet were basically in shambles. Makes sense if they’ve been barefoot for a year you probably get used to all the wear and tear

As someone claustrophobic the entire sequence in the chamber where the son and baby are trapped and out of oxygen had me holding my breath it was so intense

I also found Evelyn’s reaction to her son at the end interesting. To me she almost looked in fear at what her son had become, firing a gun at this monster. Maybe she wondered for a moment if Emmett was right about what survivor’s turn into. But she knows it’s out of necessity and the kids had to grow up eventually, especially since Lee’s sacrifice.

Lastly I’m all for this recent trend of ASL representation in cinema. Shape of Water, Sound of Metal, and these two quiet place movies.. It brings out more nuanced acting and Millicent carried this movie",nmnxqu
gzxh3xz,"I don't know if anyone else found it funny, but when Djimon Hounsou (Black man on Island) was acting all tough honking his horn, he immediately was like ""I gotta get back to my family"". 

Funniest 3 minute cameo ever 😂",nmnxqu
gzq0y4p,"I really wish they kept the subtitles up for the entire movie. Not sure how important it was, but did John Krasinski’s character and Cillian Murphy’s character talk about anything with each other besides baseball? 

Also random but I thought it was interesting seeing all those high/stiletto heels leftover.",nmnxqu
gzuoco9,Brought the monster to the island like Columbus brought smallpox to the Native Americans,nmnxqu
gzutz0y,"I think that the movie implies that the aliens are not strictly mindless. I find it hard to believe that 1. the boat would have floated to the island without being 'rowed', and 2. the alien would have stayed on top of the boat if not to explicitly hunt down the humans that got away.

Whether they are 'intelligent' is unclear, but I think they are at least as intelligent as a tiger. So they can learn to ignore certain sounds, like birdsongs or waterfalls. My bet is that they are biological super-weapons, but that's a bit unfounded.",nmnxqu
h01uyl4,"I'm realllllly glad they didn't stick with the boat (potential) cannibal/rapist cult people for long. I thought they were going to end up trapped there for a while or something. Especially with Scoot McNairy, I thought he'd have some lines or something. Only for them to be obliterated in a span of a minute. Glad they just moved on from it, thought it was about to get realll lame.

Anyway, other than the ridiculously abrupt ending-- which only left me wanting more, so I guess it worked, but I wish there was more  of a ""complete"" ending to it, but it just felt like it was in the middle of the scenes-- I thought this was even better than the original that was already solid to begin with.

I loved the 'Day 1' sequence. The editing was brilliant. The way Krasinski orchestrated the sequences, sometimes three going at once, was pretty amazing at times. And just being back in the theaters again was a nice experience. There was way more tension and suspense compared to the first one, and I just loved how he expanded the world of the film without making it feel overstuffed or convoluted. It was still simplistic, but effectively thrilling. Loved the whole island sequence too, in the trailer I thought it was going to be a flashback, so when i saw the boat I was like 'fuuuck'. Also the son put in the closet looked like he was either seriously disassociated or suffering from severe ptsd.

The screenplay may be a bit contrived at times, but it never took me out of the experience. Just relentless the entire time. Loved it. (it also lived up to my Last of Us vibes).",nmnxqu
gzptdtc,"Better than the first movie in terms of plot depth and the tension during the climax.

First film has more heart bc of the more concentrated family dynamic and John carrying it.

overall 8/10",nmnxqu
gzqy1uy,"The towel being required to stop the furnace being a death trap, and it dangling next to the door instead of wrapped over the locking mechanism was the stupidest fucking thing.",nmnxqu
gzqzacx,"Loved the movie, but there's something I don't get: why did Emmett leave very visible fires to signal his location when he didn't want to run into/help anyone?",nmnxqu
gzu3778,"Was I the only one that felt it was a deliberate homage toward Jurassic Park in the 3rd act? >!Particularly the scene where they're crouched down as the alien stalks behind them ala the raptor in the kitchen in Jurassic Park? !<

Loving people's theories/hopes for a third movie.  It would be very cool if the aliens are seen just to be the initial phase of something much worse, like attack dogs sent to take out a lot of society as some people speculated. Given both movies take place in the same few miles, maybe have part 3 take place in an abandoned New York City, as I Am Legend as that may be. And definitely get more into the lore of these creatures or what may be behind them. If they are just mindless insects, maybe show the ""Queen"" alien as cliche as that may be.",nmnxqu
gzpvig7,"I was kinda meh on the idea of a sequel going into it but I actually ended up enjoying it as much, if not more, than Part 1",nmnxqu
gzr5x6z,"Does anyone else really just want more of the before-times? The transition from before to present day was great (so was pretty much every transition in this movie) but I would love to have seen what it was like from day 1 to where they are at in the first movie. Sudden alien invasion movies are awesome and are really freaky to see everyone so helpless while everything goes to shit. 

I just kinda want more lore about the world and aliens. Where did they come from? Were they coming in on a ship or something else? Is there anything more to the aliens ie more intelligent ones or is their entire race just destructive? I have so many questions about it all still and want answers.",nmnxqu
gzu0dr8,"I’ve been back to theaters since August, but I found it fitting that A Quiet Place 2 was the first movie I saw that felt like a normal theatrical experience. I hadn’t had a crowd like that since The Rise of Skywalker back in 2019. And even with the amount of people, everyone was respectful and quiet the entire time. It really felt like a full circle moment given that the movie was the first that many of us missed due to Covid. Plus that opening from Krasinski welcoming people back to theaters really added to the experience.",nmnxqu
gzpvw11,I loved it. Maybe not as much as the first but man this franchise at this point keeps getting better and better. The two child actors in my opinion are amazing and their facial expressions take some serious talent. I give it an A.,nmnxqu
gzq5d0c,"I liked this as much as part one. My  favorite scenes are the initial attack by the aliens before society collapsed, Emily Blunt evading chaos in the car, the bear trap scene, the scene at the docks, and the discovery and subsequent violence at the island. Well done",nmnxqu
gzqgawz,"I loved it, and it was pretty much exactly what I expected it to be. Strong sequel but not quite the same impact as the original. I think some shots lingered way too long, like the gun, the oxegen tank level, etc. The acting was amazing though, by everyone involved, cinematography was beautiful. 

My main qualm was that my friend got too high and told me he didn't like the movie because everyone was ""overacting"", lol. Man it felt great to be back in a theater though, and this was the perfect movie for it after a long hiatus.",nmnxqu
gzu08ib,Suree...when Mars Attacks does it the film gets ridicule for its ending,nmnxqu

gzw5tdl,"Idk what’s worse, praying out loud when trying to be quiet or having your phone on loud so it can make a ton of noise. I’m so used to having my phone on do not disturb that I’m always amazed phone calls still interrupt important moments.",nmnxqu
gzx5a7e,"The only unbelievable thing in this movie is the gang on the dock using that noise vest. This must have been the first time they used because the outcome they got is surely the only outcome possible. Even the struggle to get it on would attract the monsters!!

Other than that 8/10. Look forward to the next one.",nmnxqu
gzxdusy,"If this doesn't greenlight a 28 years later film, then I don't know what will. 

Pretty excellent sequel! Beautifully shot action sequences, and just beautifully shot in general. This was really Cillian's movie, and he was a fine stand in for Krasinski, who may be regretting killing himself off in the first one now.

I guess I wish they had a more definitive ending, but this also feels like a bridge movie. 

For a sequel I'd love to see more of the human  threat, but also more monster designs. I feel like this series needs an ""Alien Queen"".",nmnxqu
h01qh08,Okay those oxygen tanks were way too light . Emily blunt is a straight beast .,nmnxqu
gzw2myp,How does taking a crap work in a quiet place universe ..craps can b loud,nmnxqu
h18d0h7,"Two issues:

-The highlight of the first movie (IMO) was the newspaper headline ""IT'S SOUND"" which was briefly visible near the beginning when the family was leaving town and then again later in Lee's workshop. Given what we saw in Day 1, how could it be that a newspaper with that headline was actually stocked in town? Main Street just got ripped apart, I find it impossible to believe that a truck delivering newspapers bothered to stock a machine later on.

2- At the end, the boy used a gun to shoot a monster and the girl used a pole to stab one. I really, really, really wish that it has been reversed and the boy had used a pole to whack it. This would have been a great callback to the initial invasion, which happened right in the middle of his at-bat in little league. While he was at the plate, the audience was left wondering whether he would find the courage to swing the bat.

h04pkji,"I guess I’m in the minority here when I say I was kind of disappointed in this sequel. While I felt it was thrilling and delivered on that, the movie had so much more potential in terms of worldbuilding and character development, which are essential for a sequel, IMO.

Regarding worldbuilding, we spend the first half of the movie in a bunker meeting just one person who just so happened to know Lee. Then we finally get to see this island for about ten minutes max where people live free of monsters. And then that’s it. Besides the bunker and Regan and Emmett in the wilderness and on the island, we really don’t see much more of what’s out there.

And when it comes to character development, I did not enjoy most of the characters. None of them seemed to evolve much or interest me, especially new characters like Emmett. Yes, he learns to not be much of a hermit by the end, but I still feel more could have been done with his character. Marcus and Regan also both kept on getting themselves into trouble that could have easily been avoided. Marcus was especially guilty of this, doing nothing but getting himself and his family deeper into peril. No, his moment at the end fighting off the monsters with sound because he took his headphones off doesn’t do much for me. I just found his character to be a nuisance.",nmnxqu

gzpslq8,"I'm inclined to grade it on a curve simply because it is nigh impossible to make even a ""good"" sequel to a horror movie, much less a great one. For my money, this movie is probably only a hair below the original, and that makes it arguably the greatest ""part 2"" in horror movie history (Evil Dead 2 doesn't count).

I think what I loved most was the way Krasinski made the movie: He didn't fall into the same trap that other sequels (not just horror movies) do: He didn't feel the need to make everything bigger and crazier to try and ""top"" the first. Instead he just moved the STORY along. He put the STORY first and let the set pieces and scares simply compliment the story. That's what makes a good sequel: It's a movie that happens because there's somewhere for the characters to go; it's not just an excuse to see the characters again, doing the same things again.

Here, there’s a story being told, a driving goal that motivates the heroes. So many horror movies devolve into “just survive!” or “just get out of there before it’s too late!” They make the agency of the protagonists entirely dependent on the villain. They’re being chased. They’re hiding. It’s always passive action, which makes for a bad protagonist. A Quiet Place (Part II) gives the heroes a goal: In the A-plot, it’s “get to a broadcasting radio station to play a sound that will stun the baddies.” In the B-plot, it’s “get medical supplies to treat an injury.” Our heroes move with a purpose, leaving it to the monsters to serve merely as foils to contend with along the way.

And to top it off,  Krasinki and editor Michael P. Shawver (who also cut Creed) layered the two plots together so that (through the magic of editing and blocking) the major moments of horror in both plot threads are thematically related. The film builds to a series of dramatic and thrilling high points throughout the picture, timing it so that both plot threads peak at the same time, allowing the switching back and forth between the two to retain the same sense of emotional engagement. It’s practically Nolanesque how well it was handled. It makes me highly excited to see what Krasinki does next.",nmnxqu

And that baby is a newborn. Newborns eat every 2-3 hours or so. And yet at one point she leaves for like half a day. 

But yeah, besides that, the movie was great. While I felt the first had a tighter plot and the originality going for it, this again showcased superb tension balanced with moments of absolute chaos. The monsters were again done incredibly well, and again I was more scared of bear-traps and blast furnace doors than the monsters themselves.",nmnxqu

gzu0h9u,"I honestly didn't love it, but it was a good movie. A pretty decent follow-up -- just not what I was expecting. For some reason, I was anticipating that it would take the route of human vs human and we would get some last of us vibes, but that's not the movie I got, which is fine. 

The first 20 minutes were incredible by the way. Really loved that day one flashback -- hope we get more stuff like that in the sequel, and I presume we will. It just sucks that it's going to take another 2-3 years to resolve where this movie left off. I also think this film felt a little less complete? I think the first one gets a little more props from me since it was never meant to have a sequel. Of course, I, much like other people, see the gapping potential of this franchise, and I'm glad John didn't call it quits. But, I don't know, I guess I just preferred the narrative the first movie followed. 

Still good though.

h017987,"Things I liked in this film: I really respect the fact that they didn't feel the need to either explain the origin of the creatures, or explain how things were going worldwide. 
  
In horror sequels there's a real temptation to try and explain the strange thing that's happening, or to cut around the world to underline how fucked things are. Not needed. Do it like this and just focus on the situation they're in right now.   
  
Stuff I didn't like: They made some terrible decisions. Every D&D player knows you don't split the party. Also, carrying in both O2 tanks when you hear the explosion when you could just leave them right outside and come back to them, while it worked out, was still a bad move.  
Also, you need to open that hatch for air sometimes, but that doesn't mean you need to go walking right out into the room. Just open it a crack, get some air, then close it if someone gets noisy. No-one just used it as a... ...well, as a quiet place.   
  
Also, that was some absurdly unlucky drifting of that monster infested boat.",nmnxqu
h09h4vv,"Egh. Wasn’t a fan. Especially that ending.

I felt the equivalent of “...and then...?” throughout the movie. Like something was missing from each scene and setup.

It might just be because the monsters were already sorta explained so the mystery was gone, which was so much of what I liked aboutthe first movie.",nmnxqu
gztafeg,"These movies are so frustrating to me.

They're well shot, acted, create tension unlike much anything else, and generally just delightful to watch.

I just wish the characters in them were allowed to be smart.

In this world, after all this time, who the *fuck* would use sound traps? What does that accomplish other than creating a trap that puts you in as much danger as the person you catch?

If Cillian hadn't set the bottle trap then the family would have just walked quietly past his hiding place without inadvertently attracting two monsters *directly to his fucking hiding place.* The looters toward the end were killed as a direct result of attaching a bunch of noisy bottles to Cillian. Who the fuck survived in this world for over a year and still thought ""yeah, lets trap people by threatening them with making a lot of noise, which will attract monsters to their location where we also plan to be.""

And then we have a group of people actually being smart, living on an island after realizing the monsters can't swim - and the universe conspires against them to put a monster on a boat, to float that boat to their exact location, and for the monster to just *patiently chill on the boat for 8ish hours* instead of leaping screaming at any damn thing near the water that makes any noise. No gulls. No fish splashes. Perfect god damn silence overnight so this boat can just accidentally carry this monster to the island.

Like, boy child should be smart enough to not fuck around in a strange area for no reason (that he knows for a fact has a monster nearby!), but that's a way less contrived excuse for a danger sequence at the end than the monster just sitting on a boat overnight and that boat just happening to drift to the island.",nmnxqu

I wish we could've seen more of society breaking down, I really enjoy that deterioration for whatever reason.

This and the first movie are both great at drawing out these incredibly tense scenes. I still found myself slightly anxious even when I knew the main characters weren't in any true danger.

The ending was abrupt and the boy's choice to explore felt like a dumb character choice.

Overall - worth a watch. If you have the opportunity to see it in a theater with others I recommend that route. Perhaps we'll get additional stories in this world?",nmnxqu

Trying to go chronologically through the movie, we already knew about the police car scene, the bus scene, the bottles dropping scene, the man grabbing the kids/hand over mouth scene, the train scene (I think), the “everybody get inside” scene, the jumping onto the car scene AND the popping up from behind the car scene, the dragging the person under the garage door scene, and the can’t shut the door because of the monster’s hand scene. 

That’s not to say that the movie was bad; quite the opposite actually, I really enjoyed it. But I do wonder how much more I would have enjoyed it if I wasn’t able to identify what was about to happen just based on the scenery.

Also, people knew these aliens couldn’t swim and no one until now thinks about going somewhere surrounded by water this whole time? Are Hawaii and other islands just chilling during this whole time?

The beginning of this movie makes it seem like the aliens took over suddenly and wiped everything out quickly, but in the last movie they have all these news article about them. 

Between this and the first movie, the whole plot is just poorly constructed.

Also the moral of this movie is don’t have kids during a survival situation because they will fuck everything up.",nmnxqu
h1o87nq,"Overall enjoyed it. Annoying things that I'm having trouble seeing past though:

- why would the audio of ""beyond the sea"" be a puzzle?? What do they gain from this? Why not just broadcast their location and how to get there?? Wouldn't you want to save as many people as possible?

- why did the girl go off on her own? Yes the mom had to stay with the baby and the injured son, but at least explaining her plan to everyone before she left would make sense. She can't know how much noise she's making so good chance she's dead before she even reaches the island without anyone with her, hence the deus ex machina save she gets. I also didn't like how this sidelined the mom. Yes it's realistic that she'd stay with her helpless kids but sheesh what a boring plot line. 

- that pharmacy would not have ANY meds left and you know it

- why do the boat people have that trap?? First thing I thought was ""so you make a trap with a bunch of noise, and then you all gather around the noisy thing, which is exactly where the monster will go?"" And sure enough they're all dead moments later when the monster goes to the noise lol. What were they hoping would happen??

- the boy is a fucking moron for going exploring with his injured foot

- ""if I don't go, soon you'll be in a lot of pain"" lol why isn't he in a lot of pain now??

- how much battery life does that hearing aid have? And how did the speaker work after she cut off the power cable?

- the monsters can't swim???? And nobody knew this?? Literally everyone would have gone to an island by now, that should be as common knowledge as the fact that they hunt by sound. That newspaper in the first movie should have read ""it's SOUND! Also they CAN'T SWIM""

- so they show up on this island, explain why they came all this way, and knowing her mom and brother and baby sibling are waiting for this miracle noise to come over the radio they're like ""nah we'll take a nice nap and put it on the radio tomorrow afternoon""

I was expecting him to possibly be a secondary antagonist and it turns out he had just lost hope and was a bit selfish (which he atoned for)",nmnxqu

I also was reminded how much I hate large movie audiences. I had a family sitting next to me who clearly hadn't even see the first fucking Quiet Place movie. This 12-13 year old kid asks ""IS SHE DEAF???!!"" When it showed the scene from the daughters perspective in the truck and she can't hear anything, despite her using sign language for 10 minutes before that AND BEING DEAF THE ENTIRE FIRST FUCKING MOVIE.

Was good movie, idk which I like more first or this one. Main part that I didn’t like was when Regan killed the alien with one swing of the pole. I just didn’t expect them to so easily die from blunt force. With that being the case reclamation should be a breeze once the frequency is widely used.

The monsters are even more inconsistent than they were in the first. Their attraction to sound was higher or lower depending on which served the plot. How in gods green earth am I supposed to believe that a monster on a fucking boat alone makes it to the island just by floating aimlessly? Why did Cillian Murphy not just cut himself free when he was hanging underwater? HE WAS LITERALLY HOLDING A KNIFE. Why did the monster chase Noah Jupe down the bunker and collapse it but when FIVE CHARACTERS were there the monsters were like ""oh okay no one went down there""??

How am I supposed to care about Cillian Murphy's character? When Regan tells him he's nothing like her father, and Murphy's character says something like 'I never could be' how did he know what sacrifices he made? He wasn't there for the first film!

This scene and the opening scene where John Krasinski is telling everyone to be quiet felt like they were playing to the audience but made no sense taken in the context of the film.

Also, instead of playing Beyond the Sea and having people figure out their message, why didn't they just literally record a message that said ""We are on x island. It is safe here, the creatures can not swim."" Just seemed weird to have some secret message play if they are trying to let people know that the island is safe.

- why they did not kill the second monster at the beginning?

- how the girl got that the song is a signal and why they just did not simply say it ? Why that weird game ?
- why they did not stop by the pharmacy BEFORE the trip?
- Why those island people don’t give a fuck about the end of the world? Where is security? Where are patrols?
- why wild people never tried to check the island?
- why monster became so stupid ?
- And why the movie has the same ending as the first one? What was even the point of this movie ? All characters are at the same place.

h6kvkpe,"# I've put thought into this review, and I'm not just hating for the sake of it:

I didn't like the first, I found it gimmicky, predictable, uninspiring and boring. The cinematic/technical aspects and the acting were great, I am talking about the plot and characterisation. The whole 'stay quiet or the antagonist will kill you' is an overused trope, and combining that with a post apocalyptic monster setting is just bleh.

This sequel was worse in my opinion. The monsters looked like boring versions of demigorgons (from stranger things) and were everywhere in this film. I get that it's cool to show the monster now and then, but it was just too much CGI.

The characters were dumb and their motives/decisions were nonsensical. Some aspects of the film were just incredibly unrealistic as well, similar to the first film. I get that it's unrealistic anyway, as theres monsters coming from a spaceship in the sky, but just because the genre is science fiction doesn't mean logic should be disbanded (take a look at Alien). This isn't INCREDIBLY important, but it is frustrating to the viewer and detracts from the tension which this film needed to focus on. The environment and it's characters need to be believable in order to draw the viewer in and create that tension.

Overall, my main issue is that the film didn't bring anything new and served as a typical mass-appealing monster flick. The fact that it was ***so*** similar to the first, especially in its ending, supports this. Nothing against people who enjoy that kind of film, but if you're expecting something else you will be disappointed. I didn't have high expectations but I still found myself incredibly bored throughout it.

I adored the first film, but I genuinely think this is one of those rare times where the sequel is better then its predecessor.

I hope the third movie goes in a new direction tho, because this movie didn’t really try anything new. The world building didn’t really take place until the back half, and we only got crumbs of it. Curious to see how they resolve this

h01nwe8,"Guys, please help. Me and one other person in my group were certain of what we believed was a story-heightening plot point. We believed that Reagan was actually Emett’s biological daughter for the following reasons, just off the top of my head, not having kept track of this and absorbed this as someone who has seen the first movie twice and went into this one knowing nothing:

-Emmett at one point gets frustrated and says something to the extent of “you have all of him and none of me” and gets up and walks away upset. I cannot think of any reason a close family friend would find this an emotionally significant thing to say aloud and react to.
-This helps explain why Reagan is so neurotic about her father’s love: in her mind she “killed” what was “his” child. He dies telling her, you’ve always been my daughter, I love you. I think this is great.
-It is extremely unclear what this friend owes this family. If it’s Lee’s brother, they spent a weirdly long time never saying that.
-Emmett seems to sketch the two children that may be his (big question mark surrounding Marcus, but it would explain the baseball game arrangement)
-Something seems off about Lee’s attendance of the baseball game. Similarly there is something going on between Emmett and Evelyn. Ignore this one if it’s conjecture and vibes.
-Emmett seems extremely self-conscious of the fact he doesn’t know ASL. Reagan reminds him, “enunciate”, as if that was some takeaway fallback from back when they were trying to make it work.
-It would fit Emmett’s arc if he wasn’t able to rise to the occasion of raising a deaf daughter, or even coming to her aid after the big change; he rises to the occasion now.

h0lvtfy,"I liked the movie a lot. I thought it the first one was better. Cillian Murphy was great as usual. I kind of liked how the kids were the lead characters this time around. It really added to their story. I would've liked to see them reunited though, it just kind of ends abruptly after both kids kill a monster to protect the adult they are with.

It would have been good to see Evelyn re-unite with Regan. As it is now, the movie ends without her even knowing if she is still alive.

I thought the opening sequence of day one was really entertaining as well. It really made me miss John Krasinski's character when the movie went back to the present.

I didn't really think the movie and monsters were that scary, mostly it was loud noises that got me because the film is nearly silent for the entire runtime. 

I did hate that there was someone in the theater whose phone kept going off. At first he got a call and told them to call him back and someone actually asked him to turn it off or silence it. So instead he got like 4-5 text messages that came with music and that he had to check each time. It immediately reminded me why last year I was hated going to the movie theater before they all shut down. I've loved that new movies have been going to Netflix, Amazon and HBO Max just so I could avoid this situation.

A announcement from John Krasinski played before the movie talking about how glad he was to see us remember how important it is to experience a new movie with people. Yeah, now I remember how much it fucked sucked in the first place. Hollywood wants us back in the theaters so badly, when are they going to make movie theaters crack down on that taking phone calls and text messaging inside of theaters.",nmnxqu

gzt5any,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film and felt like it did it’s job in entertaining me 100%. I did feel like it ended quite abruptly but do we really need the whole filler “everyone gets back together again” scene to end the movie? I feel like it was a good decision to leave that part out, especially since it makes room for a potential third movie. The movie also felt so short but I realized it was probably because it was consistently gripping my full attention and had little to no filler. I give it an 8/10 and think it was just as good as the first movie.

Also, is it normal for people to whisper/talk to each other throughout the movie in theaters now?? The people behind me WOULD NOT shut up. It almost felt like they were just using the movie as a background for their conversation. Every time the silent parts hit “pssss psss psss” behind me. Thanks you guys.",nmnxqu
gzust0a,"I hope they don't have any weird twist that the Aliens are just are  in intense pain and fear from any audio stimulus and their instinct is to destroy whatever sounds.

The teeth makes that extremely unlikely and unfeasible. They're aren't eating grass with those bad boys when they aren't killing anything that makes siund


And I definitely not feeling turning one into a  ""Pet"" trope.

Also, Im glad the film features bandit/cannibals, but they didn't become a focal point. I hate the whole "" human are the real monster""trope and eat up a ridiculous amount of run time that I didn't want. It was short, intense, and shot beautifully. The characters and Aliens where the focal point.. It was perfect.

Another bonus... Huge plus for them to not nerf the Alien.

The film's attention to detail is just so refreshing. The alien feels like a real feasible Alien/Creature. It acts like an animal. It has realized and logical weakness. They can act derpy as hell and being terrify, because the commitment to realism goes to its design.",nmnxqu
h06qcdy,"I'll be honest, I'm surprised so many people liked it.

The first one seemed really realistic and didn't need jump scares to keep it suspenseful.

This one had a little girl shooting a shotgun with no recoil. Had the kid leave the bunker for no reason (going to see if you can find mum from high up is not a reason). Had savages with a boat in clear view of an island not attempt to get to the island. Them playing beyond the sea instead of saying they can't swim. Them being in a soundproof bunker then still wasting oxygen by using the box. Them using jump scares in the first 5 minutes.

h0fkhb4,"I thought this movie was pretty bad and super underdeveloped. Here are my complaints, its a long list. Feel free to respond to any of my points made.


1. Who are the boat/dock people? These people seemed interesting but are just dropped after the 5 min scene.

2. Why is Emmett’s dead wife in that room in the factory? Again, I think this idea could have been developed more and there could have been a discussion between Emmett and the rest of the characters about this.

3. The guy on the island who is smart enough to distract the monsters with the car but dumb enough to just randomly start shouting and get killed.

4. Annoying ass kids who don’t listen and split up.

5. What was the point of the train scene? Just to have Emmett magically save the day? Served no purpose to develop the plot other than to have cheesy jump scares.

6. Showing cgi aliens for minutes at a time looked terrible 

7. Who is Emmett? Maybe I missed this, but is he Lee’s brother? A Friend? 

8. Everyone is mumbling and you can’t hear anything. Before someone says, “they can’t speak loudly”, the movie production could still do better at getting the actors to enunciate. It’s funny because the character Regan literally tells Emmett to enunciate in the movie.

9. Emily blunts character tells Emmett to go find her daughter Regan, but then leaves on her own to get her son medication, leaving him alone. Sorry but couldn’t she have been the one to go get regan?

10. Cheesiest stupid ending that ended the exact same way the first movie did. Just a lazy copy of the first movie.

11. Myriad of the same jump scare

12. No matter where anyone is when they make the smallest sound apparently there’s an alien no more than 50ft away at all times.

13. Regan knows what switches do what at the radio tower 

14. The boat with the alien from dock just drifts to the island 

15. The bear trapped kid despite being in tons of pain decides to walk all around the factory.

16. How many times did Emmett hand Regan her hearing aid? Seemed like she never had it even though it was hers.

17. The whole end objective of getting the hearing aid to the radio station didn’t really do that much because it still required people to have a radio to effectively use the frequency that the aliens don’t like. I thought it would be a broadcast-like thing, like in Mars Attacks, that cripples all the aliens in the vicinity.

18. Regan kills an alien with a pipe at the end. Even though she shot one of these aliens on the train earlier with a shotgun and it lived, her swinging a blunt object at the end killed it...

19. PG-13 killing scenes 

20. Emmett can’t take a loose noose off his neck at the dock 

21. When all the characters stay in those factory air chambers for safety from the aliens, their failsafe to prevent being locked in there indefinitely is a towel...

22. This is the most flagrant flaw. Why is the song “beyond the sea” playing on the radio to tell people to come to the island. How about you just say “hey the aliens can’t SWIM, come to our island and you’ll be safe”. Instead they do this dumb song riddle. 

Sorry was it precedent that the aliens know English and now you have to speak in code??? Literally no point to this part in the movie. 

28 days later (a much better film) had this idea of telling people where “safety” was too by playing the looping message on the radio. The only difference was that this message just flat out said where to go. No riddles. 

The list goes on probably. Just a poor film overall. Cool intro sequence, and then the plot just falls. I would be very curious to see why people enjoyed this movie.",nmnxqu

They clearly hang out at and around those docks all the time. They set a trap at the end of the dock attached to noise makers (cans and bottles) but they all line up on the dock. It would make sense the monsters would go for the noise but they dont anticipate it going through them on the dock first? Were they going to eat them, breed them, what was the end goal?

They are so close to an island with a radio tower they never dared venture outwards? Just hanging out by the docks. 

Their skin and eyes. Very jaundice looking, were they just fried by the sun, did they develop scurvy like pirates with not enough vitamin C?

Whats their deal? I liked that they were added but I cant get past the logistics of their settlement location, why they stayed, whats their goal, and why their skin and eyes were all messed.

Is Emmett related to Lee? The way Evelyn was acting and some of the interactions with the kids would suggest they were, but it was never made clear. Dijmon Hounsou was wasted.

The more we learn about the aliens and the invasion the less it makes sense. So, the small town was invaded on day one, yet Lee was able to gather newspapers about the invasion and lay the sand trails? The National Guard is mobilized, has the means to tell people to assemble on the coast, gather ships, and wait for people to arrive, all with out generating enough noise to attract the aliens?

If they do a part 3, they must go for a time jump. Noah Jupe was 12 in the first movie, he was obviously 14 and going through puberty in the second movie, and he's now 16 and as great as he is, he couldn't pass for a 12 year-old if his life depended on it.

h54g4xt,"Just watched it. Enjoyed it throughly. Fantastic suspense; absolutely killer at points.

Two gripes:

1) Was anyone else frustrated by the lack of urgency once they were on the island? You have a family waiting for you on the mainland; why are we taking our sweet time getting to the radio station?

2) Why did the island not just play a recording saying, ""They can't swim. Get to an island. We have supplies here""? The cryptic ""Beyond the Sea"" seems unnecessary. Perhaps they didn't have a recording device, but that seems unlikely in a radio station.

Again, I'm nitpicking, but that's all that's left in what is a strong sequel.",nmnxqu
h5yfp6d,"I loved this movie. Yes, some good points have been raised about pacing and potential plot holes but aside from those things I liked it. Here's *my* biggest gripe

Emily Blunt

They gave her nothing to do in this movie. Her husband wrote this one and all he does is sends her to the store for oxygen - and that's petty much it. The first movie, she's prepping a soundproof nursery, stepping on nails and giving birth *silently* - and in this movie she begs a dude to help them. Why, John?! Whyyy?

Also, at the end of the first movie, the daughter figures out the WEAKNESS and then Emily shoots an alien who is slowed down but not destroyed by the noise. They all turn to the monitors and see a swarm of aliens running to the house... the end

In part 2, it picks up at the very same moment but no swarm of monsters is approaching and it's day light. Wtf?

For me, the tension, the use of noise and silence, and the emotional depth of the characters make the movie. It's a scary movie that makes you care for its protagonists. I think that's noteworthy.

(seriously, John, whyyyyy?)",nmnxqu
h5zp3qt,"I hated it, super predictable.... to the point of being annoying and how if people were on the island for some time living their hippy life, then how did the aliens suddenly get there? And rhe baby... whynis there always a screaming baby in apocalypse movies where you have to shut the fuck up... same as war movies or bad guy movies where the kid screaming would give you away

Honestly even the original was better... seriously if the alien can't really see you, chuck something behind it and hide until it goes the fuck away again

And if the aliens can't hear whispers why not get some soundproofing and do up some place...  also since when is a furnace air tight?
Man this movie was just waiting for one stupid cliche after another... those aliens must have gone apeshit trying to catch birds.. I mean they can fly and swim... geese must really piss them off

h61a381,I just watched the movie and the only part that annoyed me that I can’t figure out is how John Krasinki’s character immediately knew the monsters react to sound. Wasn’t that Day One? Meaning it was their first interaction with the monsters. How would he know right away that they react to sound and to tell people to stay quiet?,nmnxqu
h6g4c61,"Maybe this is trying to be a good drama, but as a horror movie it's terrible.  The writing is extremely lazy, even by horror standards.  The world and its monsters don't follow their own rules; one moment they're nullified by ambient noise, another they are not.  One moment the ""special frequency"" can incapacitate one and leave it vulnerable to bullets, the next it cannot.  Why?  Reasons.  Why does the frequency expose the monster's vulnerable point, in the front, but then after taking a shot straight to the face it's unharmed but then goes down after one to the rear?  Why can it take a blast with shotgun but a child stabbing it with a metal rod downs it instantly?   This might be forgivable if there was any sort of plot or character development, but there is none.  The surviving protagonists from the first move are the same as they are in the second.  They make the same stupid mistakes and we learn nothing about their motivation in either of the two movies except for ""family"" and ""survival.""  The only good thing I can say about the movie is that the sound and visual design is great, it's just stretches over a hollow carapace of a film.",nmnxqu

hjn487d,"What I don’t get about the aliens is that they don’t even eat humans, so what do they want from them?",nmnxqu
gzvvdtf,"It’s rather frustrating how the main characters have such insane plot armor. The aliens are hyper aggressive towards any other human that is not one of them: they charge at the slightest sounds and swing wildly at anyone they detect but whenever Marcus, Regan, Evelyn or Emmett were in close proximity to them, they’d defer to creeping around and/or being very hesitant.

Also, how are Evelyn and Marcus not dead? They should have been sliced to ribbons when the alien was attacking them at the end. It should have had enough reach to catch more than just her leg, which I’d imagine at this point such an injury would mean losing her leg?

I’m probably overthinking this and I’m not sure why I expected anything different. Still a good movie overall but not as good as the first and can definitely be annoying with its plot contrivances.",nmnxqu
gzu4qei,"Am I the only one that thought this movie had insanely major plot holes- to the point I started rooting for the monsters?

I am not a stickler for movies- I promise. I don’t analyze every scene and determine if it was realistic. But I wrote down like six points that made no sense, at all.

I’ll share two of them for examples:

1) The one island was broadcasting a hidden message, a song that said over the sea? And the message was that they were in a refuge over the sea? These monsters don’t speak English. Why would they just not say that they are in a safe house over the sea? What could possibly be the incentive to send a hidden, cryptic message over the radio?

2) The entire monster was defeated when we learned it could not swim. But then randomly one of our stars discovered a monster on a boat that destroyed the whole island. How long was the monster on a boat before he or she was discovered? Is this monster an accomplished sailor?",nmnxqu
gzxgxt4,"Tfw a 15(?) year old girl can kill a monster by stabbing it in the fleshy parts, but the world's militaries were overrun.

How the fuck are people struggling to kill these things? They even expose their own heads when they hear.

I cannot imagine how high caliber rounds, missiles, or bombs wouldn't eviscerate these creatures if they're weak enough to die to a metal pipe.

A lot of dumb shit in this movie but this was the one that took me out the most.",nmnxqu

Also, anyone else think the train destruction scene hinted at maybe a BIGGER creature? Like some Alpha/Queen monster out there somewhere. I can see why it doesn't mean anything, other then ""look how dangerous one or maybe a pack of them are""...but still. Can't shake the feeling that was a foreshadow to something.",nmnxqu
gzxnjvz,"I feel indifferent about this movie. It's the first time I've been so at odds with critic/audience consensus, but I just can't bring myself to liking it.

A couple issues I had were:

Incessant long, slow shots of feet walking or slowly doing things that are very pretty to look at but (in my mind) don't justify the amount of time they take up on the screen.

Not a lot of stuff actually happens. The entire arch of this movie felt like it could have been condensed into the first hour. Honestly there are like two or three significant things that happen that are drawn out/padded by the slow plodding shots that I mentioned earlier. This also made the characters feel very shallow and one dimensional (Caring mother, brave smart deaf girl, resilient boy, downtrodden friend)

Plot holes/inconsistencies. Why would Emmett agree to look for the girl when he just said that they couldnt even stay? Going out and risking your life to look for someone seems like it is asking significantly more than just letting people live with you. Why would the aliens just now, like over 400 days after the invasion learn how to drive a boat?  How would they be able to find the island? Why wouldn't Emmett have basic medical supplies if a pharmacy seems to be a couple hours walk away? I'm sure there are others but these are the few I picked up.

Weirdly abrupt ending. The girl and Emmett completed their goal but they are still a long ways away from the mom and brother. They could have taken another 5 to 10 minutes to wrap that up nicely, especially considering all the time spent on those long drawn out shots I mentioned earlier.

Overall I'd give it a B- or a C+. It didn't do anything that poorly but it didn't do anything that well either.",nmnxqu

gzuekvt,"Edit: If you're going to grace this post with a downvote, at least have the common courtesy to give me a reach around - explain why you disagree


Incredibly average/mediocre movie. And I'm going to write why. The stakes weren't high enough. Yes it's a ""within family"" movie not a ""destroy aliens"" movie, I get it, but goddamn what a *boring* family! I couldn't bring myself to care for any of the characters because there are 3, just 3 things in my opinion that make a character awesome in movies. Wit, humor and/or badassery. Any combination of these 3 qualities and you have a good character. 

None of these 3 were found in any character except a small bit of ""badassery"" if you count Emily Blunt firing weaponry with 0 recoil. Absolutely no recoil, because her arms are made of reinforced concrete. 

I didn't smile once. Not once! Does a serious movie mean you cannot make the audience smile even once? Not that it has to be a riot, jokes out the ass, but even something underhandedly clever that makes you smile like ""you sly devil, you"". Not even once.

Character development: There are people in this thread saying there is 0 character development and that's technically false, there's just 1% character development - it's still horribly little. The boy becomes braver at the end - great. Do I care? No. Emily Blunt is.... just doing Emily Blunt stuff, The girl... I really can't say, I just cannot bring myself to care for her - both her and her mother are the exact same from the first movie. She is terribly bland, even if she has great intentions, I'm sorry. She goes to a freakin Island, an island, to SAVE them. Why? They're already on a fuckin island, they're safe. She brings the danger to them, ironically, selfishly. The baby? A plot device, nothing more. Crying babies in movies automatically get a 5/10, hate that sound.

The use of sad violin music was borderline pretentious every. single. time. Ok  Krasinski, we get it, the moment is sad as shit (not really). Ok. The use of silence was at least good. That had some impact.

Whoever decided on the sound for the monsters needs to be gutted by fishhooks and hung to become jerky. What the fuck is that annoying clicking sound that every single monster movie has to use?! CLICK...cliclclcilciklcikclkc. fuck off. The design of the head is great but the sound was so fucking annoying and overdone, honestly. 

This whole movie was a Jurassic park hide-behind-a-counter-till-the-monster-passes-you-by-in-suspense repeated ad-infinitum. Just 0 inspiration, 0 stakes. Nothing clever done with the monsters. No real plot, no motivations, just a very small ""slice of apocalypse life"" that I cannot bring myself to care about. I am Legend pulled it off so much better.

It gets a 5/10 from me.",nmnxqu
gzuai9z,Those kids are all stupid as fuck,nmnxqu
gzq9c11,"This was overall really good, but definitely a step down from the original. I liked the suspense and the scares, and Cillian Murphy’s addition was excellent. The opening scene in particular was absolutely fantastic and probably the best part of the whole movie. But there’s a few issues I have:

1.	The ending was SUPER abrupt. It didn’t feel like much of a resolution - the characters were in the middle of scenarios, they managed to kill their respective monsters, and then it just ended. I didn’t get a feeling of finality from the third act the way I did with the first. If there’s a third movie then it’ll probably all tie together much better but as its own film I feel like it really could have benefitted from about 5 extra minutes to let everything sink in.

2.	Did the monster seriously get onto the island by sitting on the boat and the boat randomly drifting across the water? If so, that’s genuinely terrible writing and there’s no excuse for it. That simply wouldn’t happen.

3.	My biggest confusion: Were humans turning into the monsters? They show the infected little girl and the same time Noah Jupe discovers the mutated corpse, and I thought they were showing what Cillian Murphy REALLY meant when he said that “the people who are left aren’t worth saving.” But this revelation is immediately dropped and not explored any further. If they’re not becoming monsters, what was up with the girl and the corpse? If they are becoming monsters, is Cillian Murphy doomed since he got his leg sliced at the end? Are the monsters spreading their disease unintentionally, since they seem to just kill anything that makes sound without a second thought? I didn’t get what they were trying to go for.

I’d probably give the first an 8/10 and this one a 7/10. More of the same (which is mostly good) but a little sloppy, not very surprising, and containing a set of its own issues. Still had a good time though! Hopefully it makes a ton of money so we can have a great modern horror trilogy.",nmnxqu

These fucking aliens can't swim? How did they take over earth? This is so laughable.

Also, someone please explain to me why the family decides to move around barefoot all the time. Makes no sense. You can walk around in shoes without making noise (Murphy's character manages to do it) and you could also just wrap some cloth around them. You could even wrap cloth around your bare feet...

The parallel editing also got annoying really quick and felt way too constructed. What are the odds that both groups are cornered into a tight spot at exactly the same moment? Close to zero but the stupid script says otherwise.

What a waste.",nmnxqu

Something I liked about the first movie is that it fleshes out all of its events. It didn't leave me questioning things like this one did. Again, I couldn't hear the movie good, so that could've been it.

I'd still give it a solid 7-8/10, though. The cinematography is better than the last movie, and that one is one of the best filmed movies I've seen in a long time. I also liked the monsters a lot, though, I'll admit, >!something I didn't like is the time that it took for the monsters to get to Marcus. I'll be honest, I expected him to die right then and there, and, though I'm glad he didn't, I think it'd be better if it didn't take the monster 30 seconds to get to him. !<Another thing that confused me about the monsters is that >!they couldn't swim.

gzuqa9r,"Just saw the movie, and I loved it. 

Right before the movie started there was a little thing from Krasinski saying to not use phones, etc. The ironic part is that it was loud as fuck. 

The flashbacks were great and really demonstrates the fear and panic people feel when they get stuck in a situation like this. One thing bothered me though - did it ever mention the days between it? Emily Blunts character didn't look pregnant at the baseball field so I'm assuming it's been over 5 months, in which why would you willingly bring a new life in that will undoubtedly cry? 

I'm astonished on how they weren't immediately killed when the son started yelling because of the bear track. It seemed like it went on for at least 20 seconds. 

Is it just me or did the little girl and the other seem a bit... Odd? I get they're supposed to be feral humans or something but they looked like they were under some sort of disease or some shit. 

It's interesting that you can seemingly see one of the creatures try to save the other one drowning. Shows that there's more to them and that they have emotion. 

I love the little details they add in. When the factory chase scene was going on, you can see the creature stop for a second and click. In the island chase scene you can see the creature jump on rooftops leading to the car slightly.

From what I could tell from the dock scene it seems like the aliens just sink like a rock the moment they encounter deep waters, never to be seen again.

Putting a speaker on a boat, or simply treading deep waters making noise seems like a trivial solution to dealing with the aliens compared to this convoluted hearing aid frequency broadcast we got.

Even if the aliens don't have lungs and won't die from drowning, it seems their extremely hard and dense skin would make it impossible for the aliens to traverse from the bottom of the body of water. I'm not sure how concentrated the aliens are spread throughout the land but surely sitting at the end of a dock for a few hours with a floating speaker and watching as dozens of these aliens incapacitate themselves trying to get to the sound source in the water seems like a foolproof way to clear out a large section of land.",nmnxqu

Also I think there was a film, or editing error. The part after Mom killed the monster in the beginning, and the another one was coming, they were running and suddenly they were grabbed by someone. Within that scene it seemed like there were TWO people in mask. One person grabbed both the kids, and another grab the mom and placed their hands on her mouth.

The cinematography was serviceable and the pacing started to drag towards the middle. I wish the movie was longer to expand upon certain plot points that i thought were very surface level. Like the part where cillian murpheys character mentions theres some people worth saving. I thought that was going to be an overarching theme that was spread across the movie, but in reality all we got to see of that was the crazy boat people, and the nice people on the island. Maybe this is just me wanting more from the movie, but idk. What i also liked is how people were constantly dying around main characters to give the sense that the main characters arent safe, even though we know they are. I wish they wouldve killed the baby as fucked as that may seem, but i thought they were hinting at it with the constant shots looking at how much oxygen is left, but alas, it was just a bland suspense intended plot point. Also idk what the implications of the ending are, did she just save the whole world by broadcasting the signal? I guess it leaves it open for a part 3. Undoubtedly the whole first act of the movie is the best part, it slowly started losing me when i lost clarity of what everyone was trying to do. I know they couldn't stay in that factory considering the low supply of food and water, but when the girl wanted to go save whoever it was i was just like what? Youre gonna leave your family and safety off the hope that the songs a message?

Does it not seem extremely unlikely that we realize the song that has been playing over the radio is a live “on air” broadcast of a vinyl record playing said song? Are vinyl records “repeatable”? 

Forget about the code and it being a message/signal for where they are and the fact that they didn’t just say where they are and the creatures cant swim blah blah blah. I’m talking about a VINYL RECORD that is playing their message in hopes to reach someone? Why was there no one already up there to make sure the broadcast was always going? Why broadcast something you constantly have to come back to and place on the right spot to play the song. This would have to be a vinyl record with only that song on repeat that is long enough to do your thing and come back to or is it possible to make a record repeat itself at a certain point?

It'd be better as monsters summoned by a ritual, or dug up from the earth, invented in a lab.

\- A species of interstellar traveling beings land on a planet and running around killing things making sounds is all they do. This is the extent of their culture. How do they even get into space at that rate?  
\- Did they arrive on one, or many asteroids? If it's one, then they would be trapped on that continent as water is a big obstacle. Space is easy though.    
\- If it's asteroids they have been traveling for countless thousands of years to enter the atmosphere slow enough to not wipe out the planet (think dinosaurs) or themselves upon crashing. Unless these asteroids have engines. How'd they launch the asteroids? Are they immortal or did they live numerous generations on the asteroids?  
\- Or did they arrive in space ships? If so, it suggests some pretty high tech but we do not see any of it. Not even clothing! Feedback is their kryptonite and they cannot invent an ear plug?  
\- If these aliens cannot swim, but can travel across space, how is operating a boat a challenge? And don't use the blind excuse cuz they just traveled through space and it wasn't using their hearing ;)

The first movie made it out to be, one sound and you're dead in an instant, this movie it seems you can somewhat get away with making little sounds.

h2u6pto,"So I just finished watching the movie, and it was AWESOME! So well made, I loved every part of it. Those monsters/aliens are terrifying lol, gave me the chills every time I saw them! 

One thing I noticed, when they walked next to grass, why didn’t they go in it? Like near the train tracks. Grass blocks out sound really well, esp barefooted - I kept yelling “oh my god, just go on the grass! It’s right next to the train tracks and you won’t risk making noise with the rocks!!” Lolol.",nmnxqu

Act 1: some crazy, chaotic, inexplicable alien stuff.

Act 2: some family drama with the deaf girl running away

At the end of part 2, the kids kill a monster at the same time at different locations. Nothing was resolved and nothing changed. Yeah sure they figured out they can use the radio station but that's it. Also why the fuck is that little deaf bitch still running off when she got her brother and father killed in the first movie? She ran off in this one forcing Emmet to go after her putting his life in danger. Plus, she's the reason the monster ended up in that Village and massacred everyone.

1. Marcus making a scene when he steps on bear trap. Lets forget what's been happening and just yell out in pain continuously. 
2. Marcus going upstairs making a ruckus and putting the baby on an empty tank while the tank towel seems to disappear and reappear whenever the storyline feels like it.
3. Emmett while he had a rope around his neck on the dock... you had a knife all that time and didn't think if either lifting off the rope or cutting through it? A 4yr old put the ropes on you, cmon. 
4. Didn't know that aliens could steer or operate a boat? 
5. Why would djimon's character hesitate at the radio station when there's a clear plan on how to combat the aliens? And why weren't the garage door closed all the way when entering? Let's leave my family to save them and then turn around to just get killed? Such wasteful hesitation from a man who built that place. Out of character. 
6. Just the fact that an indestructible alien who is bulletproof and fire/explosion proof was killed by a blunt metal rod wielded by an adolescent girl, with just 1 strike, was a really? moment for me. 
7. Are they gonna drag this out for a 3rd installment? There was no closure at all for pt 2.

I appreciate all the hard work that must have gone into making this movie, I thought the actors were phenomenal and the movie looked fantastic, but there were elements of the story that really took me out of the experience. Just want to disclaim that I'm not trying to hate or be disrespectful, just maybe some folks similar to myself may feel the same way and/or benefit from this post.

Many disorganized, spoilery thoughts:

* >!The opening scene was amazing. I love that shot of Emily Blunt driving in reverse as the bus charges toward them.!<
* >!Some really gorgeous shots in the film too, love the camera work. !<
* >! When Evelyn leaves to get supplies, I would have repeatedly warned Marcus about the low oxygen in the tank. Evelyn did warn him to just stay inside the bunker, at least. Speaking of...!<
* >!Marcus leaving the bunker felt insanely stupid to me. Just felt like one of those really contrived horror-movie-character choices. He was warned, he's injured, and there's a baby to consider.!<
   * >!Also, climbing a ladder the day after you get hit with a bear trap also seems a bit -- unbelievable? That thing must have wrecked some of his muscle, no? !<
   * >!I did love Noah's acting in that bear trap scene, genuinely created a ton of tension and fear for their safety in me.!<
* >!Felt strange that Reagan went into that train car when her stated goal was finding a boat to get to the island (again, contrived horror-movie-character logic). Felt kind of like a way to just force her into a confined space to ratchet the tension and you know Noah is on the way. Didn't feel a ton of risk to Reagan's life. You could see where the scene was going  and it just kind of undermined it for me.!<
* >!When Emmett and Reagan were attacked by the people by the boat (Emmett foreshadowed what people had become earlier so you knew that had to payoff somewhere), the sound trap thing also didn't make a ton of sense to me. I immediately said to my girlfriend that this seems like something that could just as easily be used against you. And -- it was.!<
* >!As soon as you see one of the monsters drown and another on the boat as it drifts out of the frame, you know what's going to happen to the peaceful little island after Emmett and Reagan arrive.!<
   * >!I also really struggled to care when the monster hit the island, We got virtually no time with the people to build up any investment. I think this was a function of the relatively brief runtime (just cracking 90 minutes). !<

Again, I didn't hate it and I don't mean disrespect. I did really want to like this movie given the buzz. Please feel free to disagree and I hope you enjoyed the movie! Probably a like 5 or 6 out of 10 for me, though.",nmnxqu
h5tn19y,"If the aliens cannot travel through water, then small islands, like Easter Island, are probably unharmed entirely.
Also, I'm having trouble seeing how the world militaries would lose against these things. They'd figure out the sound frequency stuff fairly quick, and their weakness to water. Aircraft carriers out in the Atlantic and Pacific could easily scramble F18s and bomb the fuck out of these things by attracting them to one area with noises.
Also somewhat related, what's going on with the people in the ISS lol? Or submarine crews all over the world.",nmnxqu
h5xmogf,"I don't think it was the same boat, but when Emmet untied the boat when they first got there, I thought ""You never untie it until you're ready to go.""

h68s5p3,"Krasinski is a great director. The transition/prologue was done masterfully. The dual scenes were the highlights of the movie, and I loved Cillian Murphy's character.",nmnxqu
h6rr5cr,"This is sooo slow and sooo boring. When you kill main characters off in the first movie, it makes them seem safe, or easily disposable in the second one. I am very sure little girl doesnt die, I am pretty sure new guy or mom does. Even if and when they dont it doesnt make the much of a difference. If they get killed off it is same old thing and when they dont it is just to subvert expectations. So all of the slow being quiet stuff is just super slow and being quiet with no real stakes at hand. 

Compare it to Game of Thrones. After the red wedding they were just adding people to kill them off. Who cares.",nmnxqu
h71w2vz,"Just rented this. /r/movies is always way too easy on movies when they first come out. Yes, there are some great scenes and good direction throughout the movie, but it has tons of problems, not least of all the nonsensical plot. Surprised none of the top comments aren’t more critical.



EDIT: just to expand, none of the characters primary motives made any sense. Why did they leave in the first place? Sure, part of their compound burned down, but they still have half of an ‘effin farm when everyone else is living in warehouses or docks and apparently low on food or cannibals? And they just leave randomly hoping the flame in the distance is better circumstances? With an extra ~10 minutes of script/screen time they could have found a way to explain this away. 


Also, what the eff is the point of the girls journey? To play the damaging noise over a short radio? Why? In case somebody within its short broadcast distance happens to turn on the radio with the aliens around? It’s not to protect her family - the little radio they have is no more effective than her existing amp. Again, easily solved by having the main motivation finding a colony or a huge loudspeaker or something. 


Those were my biggest problems with the movie. Also didn’t believe emmet or Emily blunts motivations. Also tons of flat out dumb things like the straight up comical evil boat colony and utopia island colony. Too much of the alien, too. I could suspend disbelief for the stupid feedback weakness, but adding now swimming was a step too far. 

The movie does very little to advance the world or change their circumstances. I do think passing the bad ass monster killing torch to the kids was a good enough idea, but I don’t think the movie earned it or made that convincing (especially for the little wienie boy). 


There were some genuine tense moments, and I liked the parallel scenes, but too many problems for me to view this movie favorably.

h87ruyn,"So there is going to be a part 3, right? I loved this movie, but the ending left me with a Halo-2- ending taste in my mouth. Also, why didn’t the radio station just broadcast in words that the island is safe?",nmnxqu
h8psjpq,"I had to work really really hard to suspend my disbelief in too many ways to say this was a good movie. It was entertaining, but just barely. There are just too many terrible, glaring, and ridiculous plot holes. How can there be so many of the stupid things that there is always a half dozen within 'earshot'? There would have to be hundreds of trillions of them blanketing the planet to always have so many in close proximity. What do they eat, and how have then not already depleted that food source? No one was able to use ham radio to spread the word about them not being able to swim? This should have been common knowledge globally from day one. Somehow the aliens are able to hear human activity over the sounds of trees and insects from hundreds of yards away, but when they are right on top of humans, they can't hear heartbeats and respiration?

Ultimately it was just lazy writing and only mildly enjoyable for the disaster nature of it.",nmnxqu
h9gxot0,"Just watched this, loved it! However, I can’t work out why, if they can play a song via the radio (beyond the sea), they cannot have one of the islanders speak on air telling people where to go instead?",nmnxqu
ham5u9g,"I say this movie is pretty good at selecting actors.

* The sister is so ugly, that makes me feel uneasy on every scene that show her face, especially the close shots. OMG can't they find any prettier actress?
* The brother looks so stupid, both looking and doing. I have no idea why he decided to grab a binocular and climb upstair with that broken leg, just to see trees?
* The mother has an annoying face. Begging someone else to do something for her family, selfishly.
* Only the hunter is useful in the movie.

This whole family is a burden to anyone that unluckily meet them.",nmnxqu
gzy3862,"Was I the only one who thought this movie was kinda mediocre? I didn't care for the first one, but thought that this might be better, but I felt it was worse.

First of all the ending was so abrupt. I get they are setting up for a third part, but I felt like nothing was really resolved.

Second, I honestly could not stand the scenes in the safe (was that what it was?). My god that dragged on forever. I did not care what happened to these people. I just wanted to see the island.

The suspense was good at some parts, but kinda dragged on for too long to the point that I felt more annoyance than suspense.

Also the mom was kinda cool at the end of the first one, but they definitely turned her into kinda a weakling in this one.

I also thought there would be more flashbacks and/or context to the aliens but there really was none. I felt like it rendered the initial flashback scene pointless, as it really didn't add to anything.

Finally, as expected the baby was a complete liability to the main characters. But it really didn't add that much to the overall plot.

I respect that both Quiet Place movies tried something new with the apocalypse/zombie genres. It definitely is not a typically end of the world movie. But I personally, feel like they could have been executed better.",nmnxqu
gztfd1l,"I hate to say it but damn Emily Blunt's character was useless and a horrible mother and a total bitch for saying to Emmett ""you must go get my daughter... that I let out of my sight and let her sneak off in the middle of the night"" 

if I was Emmett I would have risked the aliens hearing and coming for them with a giant belly laugh ""BAHhahahHahahahah, lady, go get your own kid"" 

""oh wait I see your limping and have a wrap around your foot, please don't tell me you were stupid enough to step on a nail or something... oh wait you actually were stupid enough to step on a nail""

""oh wait you have another kid who nearly got his foot ripped off and a week old (at best maybe even 2-3 day old) newborn baby, I fail to see how any of this is my problem, you're on your own and you won't last a day. Actually you're lucky your daughter at least is more useful than you ever could hope to be. So you know what, you're right I'm going to go get your daughter and keep her with me because she at least brings something to the table to getting out of this alive""

""OHHHHHH WAIT SURPRISE SURPRISE DUMB mother look what we got over here,while you were sitting behind being useless I found your daughter cornered in the back of a train car completely made by an alien a half step away from biting her head off before I saved the day""


""OHHHH SURPRISE SURPRISE YOU left the poor terrified kid alone with a newborn baby and then the idiot kid did what idiot kids do and wandered off on his own and almost got himself killed 10 different times before doing what idiot kids do and forgot to put the towel in between the lock and nearly entombed himself""

""WAIT What you mean to tell me this whole time there was another kid that you were so careless about let himself get merked because he was playing with a toy with sound right in front of you!!!""

gzucesh,"Actual plot hole:

The alien in the boat would have jumped ship as soon as it was within ear shot of the island people (and that would have been very far out as they were making no attempt to silence themselves) knowing how good their hearing is.

For the beginning of the movie, I was confused as I could've sworn A Quiet Place featured Sandra Bullocks, and that was the one about sound. But looks like I got my movies messed up. 

Honestly, the movie just wasn't that good or appealing. I've watched a ton of movies in the past two months, and this is probably the worst of them all. Heck, I even liked Spiral more than this... Wasted potential. I was really looking forward to this one.",nmnxqu

gzqlthy,"Saw this tonight and I have weird feelings about it. There were a ton of time where my wife and I were like 'thats dumb,' but we both thought the movie was great. 

I'm not sure how to describe it. Like there was a bunch of dumb stuff in it, but the direction, acting, etc was good enough that I didn't care about plot holes or stupid decisions. I felt kind of the same way about the first one. 

All of the characters are great and well acted. Emily Blunts character is one of my favorite female protagonists in recent memory. Both kids were great. Cillian Murphy awesome as usual. 

I loved the cinematography and direction of this movie. 

The opening sequence was amazing. 

There is too much of this world to squeeze into 90 minutes. The scope is too large to not be at least two hours. This left the movie feeling a little rushed. 

Sound design was fantastic, from the daughter to the monster sound effects. Loved hearing the weight of monsters walking if that makes sense. 

Overall, a really fun kind of horror summer blockbuster. Definitely a popcorn flick, but a worthy one to be sure. I'm sure people like yourmoviesucks will tear it apart, but it's absolutely worth a watch and maybe better than the first one.",nmnxqu

gzx2c63,"Both Quiet Place movies are incredibly jarring and challenging for me to watch. On one hand, they are extremely competent in their construction: the characters are well written and acted, immersive both visually and in sound design, are well paced, etc. All the interactions between Cillian Murphy and the deaf daughter, in particular, are really well done in this movie. On the other hand, the entire world is built on this house of cards that is always threatening to (and in my opinion actually does) collapse into madness. The fundamental concept is so ludicrous and internally inconsistent that I cannot suspend my disbelief (and I really want to, considering the first hand I mentioned above). 

How can the creatures be blind, yet not have developed enough echo-location to hear heart-beats & breathing? How are they not running into trees all the time? How did the military not pick up on their vulnerability to sound? Why are they doing insane things like walking on sand instead of on leaves when there is barely a difference in sound level? Why is the family scared at all when they have this hearing aid that clearly incapacitates any creature that comes to them?  Why did the people on the island decide to get cutesy by playing a coded song on repeat instead of an obvious message? 

None of these questions have any answers given, and in fact, I can't even imagine how a coherent answer could be given",nmnxqu

Getting to see how it all started, the chaos that happened, and then taking us right to the end of the first film. This didn’t feel forced.

This movie,no one communicates with each other pretty much just argue with each other. When the group gets split up that's when it gets all messy I would have been happy with just the deaf chick and scarecrow going off on adventure. Nothing is explained on how they have power for the radio station. Shooting locations were a joke if you are going to shut down grand island bridge the whole day better have more than 30 seconds of screen time on that bridge. Also other shooting locations what a waste!  Could have filmed it on a green screen and saved your money for how little you show them.",nmnxqu

h0t4kzl,"He’s not a good writer. The first one was pretty good because it wasn’t written by him (he helped on the screenplay). This one was not great and I stopped trusting rottentomatoes ratings a while ago. There were so many flaws in the writing mostly but also the directing.

- The driving to the radio station place at the end was so forced just to have the girl be placed in that situation to use her hearing aid. I thought they were driving to some place that had weapons and that they maybe built traps or reinforced the building structure but nope just a random radio station because it was far from the village.

- why was the village not prepared for a potential alien attack? They would’ve definitely had a plan in place if an alien came and had weapons or would have made weapons and defensive things. They were living like they were in a safe utopia.

- how did the village have full power?

- way too many extremely slow and boring moments that were supposed to dramatic and serious and profound with sad cliche piano music playing. Just lots of wasted time of people walking or just sitting there doing nothing interesting, just keeping quiet.

- didn’t really feel any strong emotions for any of the characters. Maybe a little empathy for children and baby because they are young, but no strong character building. Really relying that you saw the first one where there was more character building to create empathy. Just lots of walking and semi interesting alien action fights.

- so many missed opportunities to create more tension. It was just so straight forward. Try to be quiet and then an alien appears when noise is made or randomly sometimes.

- “a film by John Krasinski”. Please.... I only think amazing movies in which the person writes and directs it or naive film school kids should put that in their credits.


I think John should stick to just directing and acting because writing isn’t his forte. I think he can direct fairly well, but he shouldn’t be the sole writer. He needs help from other writers. I think if were to do a lot more writing for movies and tv then maybe in a few years he will have learned the art form better and will be able to write a movie or show solely himself.",nmnxqu

Also, if white noise is enough to mask human sounds, why not just set up a big speaker and tell Alexa to play rain sounds and go about your life with no fucks given?

overall great movie tho!",nmnxqu
gzwbr12,"I liked the movie give it a solid 6.5/10.

I do think it was very strange that they kind of tried to re-write Krasinski’s character. One of the main themes of the movie is the daughter wants to save people “like her father would have.” 
She even says to Cillian’s character you’re nothing like my dad and the culmination of that theme is him telling her she’s right, but she’s like her dad.

Thought this was a very strange choice considering krasiniski’s character in the first movie was really only trying to protect his family. He was never a “hero” in the sense of trying to help others like the daughter does in this movie. Cillian’s character is exactly the same, he only tried to protect his family.

If krasinski’s character was trying to save and protect other people in the first movie this would make more sense.",nmnxqu

h0l58g2,"This was not a bad film but still quite disappointing. I didn't think the story was very compelling at all.

It felt like half the film was just watching them tip-toe around. Those scenes worked so much better in the first film because you're still learning about the monsters. But now there is no mystery and there just wasn't enough suspense to keep me engaged. 

The characterization was a bit weak as well. Cillian Murphy was okay, but I wasn't really feeling the chemistry between him and the deaf girl. The other two are just stuck in the bunker for most of the film which wasn't very interesting. Djimon Hounsou was quite good but he had a very boring death. 

The ending felt like too much of a rehash. It was still quite cathartic but there was nothing memorable about it. It doesn't resonate in the same way. 

The opening flashback scene was really good though. The action scenes were well directed. The call-back to the dive sign was great. The score was solid and the film still had that same immersive atmosphere. 

I just wanted there to be more to the story. It's kinda uneventful in some ways despite so many near escapes. When the film ended I didn't feel like the characters were in a much different place from when it started. That's the most disappointing thing.",nmnxqu
h2181pr,"Just finished the film. Had never seen the first one and I hate horror films, but this was a masterpiece of cinematography. The sense of dread was perfectly executed throughout the film and I was in awe at the use of silence and sound direction throughout. Didn’t expect Krasinski to be this good a director.

Regan developed so much as a character between loathing Cillian Murphy's character to saving his life at the very end .  The ending where the two kids end up killing the creatures at precisely the same time defending the adults was so well timed .   I was not expecting the ending to occur so abruptly so they must be planning for a third movie seeing as how the mom never reunited with her children,nmnxqu

Pacing and script-wise, the movie didn’t feel as tight as the first movie. Also, I didn’t find this movie as scary as the first one. Nothing quite reached the level of tension like the nail or the birth scenes from the first movie.

gzxi2y7,"Does anyone know the deal with the uniforms hanging on nooses in the factory upstairs? Were they decayed bodies, or were they like the mannequins in I am Legend?",nmnxqu
gzy2qby,"Just got home from seeing it. They really doubled down on what worked- sound design, character interactions, moment to moment tension- and shored up the worldbuilding to be less clunky this time around. So all in all an 8.5/10 for me, compared to the first movie’s 8. It may not seem like much of an improvement, but it was a feat to try to top A Quiet Place without getting bogged down, and this is a lean, mean, much more balanced, and stressful family film that has me excited for Part III.

Of course, because Krasinski probably had to add explanation in this movie to address criticisms, there are inevitable contradictions. Like how they mentioned here that the National Guard helped people get on boats out of New York City once they learned the aliens couldn’t swim, while the dumb, heavy handed exposition newspapers in A Quiet Place said “US MILITARY DEFEATED. We cannot help you.” Even suspending disbelief on newspapers existing for very long, and that the military could not break alien armor, on the one hand you have an attempt by the government to help people, and on the other hand throwing its hands up and causing a panic later on? And now that the aliens can’t swim, large portions of the Navy and Air Force have to be intact, right? So how is that defeated, exactly?

I guess we’ll find out in Part III, when more people learn of the aliens’ weakness.",nmnxqu
gzy7rfx,I haven’t seen anyone talk about this yet. But I really love the shots of the Abbot family’s feet showing that they really have been through some shit and no longer have a home in comparison to Emmett’s boots.

What was Marcus’ motivation for exploring the upstairs area of Emmetts hideout, where he found Emmett’s decomposing wife? He seemed to be pretty clearly dedicated to sticking with his infant sibling, and was even incredibly adamant about his sister and mother both not leaving the underground den.  Was it simply to reveal Emmett’s decomposing wife? And if so, why? Perhaps there is payoff for that in Part III, but seems odd to bring up something like that without a clear motivation for discovering it anyway, and to then not pay it off in the same film.

Cillian Murphy.... God, Murphy did something I have never seen him do and it was awesome. Seeing his redemption ark actually made me cry in theaters. When he was originally put on the cast I was so sure this was going to be a story focused on Murphy as an opportunist villain in the midst of the apocalypse and I am SO glad I was wrong.

h0dhuj0,The first movie was my all time favorite! I went into the second one expecting the same and... it wasn’t as good. Not because of the acting. The original family acted superbly. Some of the supporting actors from the first scene had weak moments but ultimately I think the main issue was that it was the same story told again. I love John and I still enjoyed. I’d give it an 8/10 because they could have gone deeper into the origin of the creatures or given us something new. The endings being the same kinda made it tough to get hyped,nmnxqu
h0e5duz,"I really enjoyed the movie but I have one major point I wanted to bring up:

In part 1 we see all of those newspaper clippings in the basement and even some info about the different meteor landing spots: “Bogota: 19:52, Moscow 19:54, and Boston: 19:58.”

In part 2 we see Lee getting some fruit and the man at the counter is watching what seems to be the first widely reported news related to the incident coming from China, but he has no clue what it is and guesses it’s a bomb. Literally minutes later at the baseball game the meteors come down and shortly after the aliens show up: how could newspapers have been spread with this information? Say Boston was the American epicenter and it took a while for the aliens to spread across the country, Lee and his family wouldn’t have been able to get any newspapers anyways, because we see they’re in New England already and the Day 1 scene pretty much shows that society fell apart then and there for them. It doesn’t make much sense. 

Still, I absolutely loved both of these movies and I’m willing to write this issue off completely. Maybe at some point they met a traveler from some part of the country that held out longer, or maybe news was able to be posted on the internet before “the grid (or whatever that would be)” collapsed and they printed off clippings to share with the people that lived around them (Their original home is pretty well set up for a disaster, and I’m willing to suspend disbelief as far as it can go). Just wanted to hear what others had to say or if I’ve missed something that’ll make me get over that bit!",nmnxqu

Small gripes. Emily Blunt taking her newborn into a burning building. I know she needed that box and the oxygen, but that was a dangerous move. 

The abrupt ending. They better deliver a third movie that picks up right there.

Can someone remind me of what we know about the aliens? How do they find the people making noise once they stop making noise? Why can't people just stand perfectly still after they've made noise and avoid detection? Can the aliens sense motion? They can't smell the people. If they could hear heartbeats, they would have taken everyone out already.

h0v17rc,So I thought this was overall good but I’m not sure if it’s better than part 1. Both are better than the other in certain ways.  I definitely enjoyed this one. It seemed even more intense at times. The day 1 stuff was interesting and I actually think we saw enough of it from this family’s perspective. Emmett is an interesting new character. The bad people were effectively creepy and it was satisfying to see them get killed. I’m glad not too much time was spent with them.

They can survive the reentry of their meteor/ship whatever, guns, fire, and pretty much anything except high pitched noises. 

They don't seem to eat humans or other animals, but have huge predatory teeth. No clear motivation other than kill anyone who is too loud.

So when they announced a sequel I thought that there must be an exciting story Krasinski had thought up, but for the most part it was pretty bland.  None of the characters really grew or changed other than Cillian Murphy, but his arc was done after the first act.  

The world wasn’t expanded in an interesting way, the boat people had potential but were killed pretty quickly. The family back in the safe were given a filler B plot just to raise the stakes of the a plot.   

I definitely think Krasinski has some potential in the future to direct some great stuff but you can tell the script just suffered a lot compared to the first one where he was one of three writers.

To me the ending was so powerful because Marcus seemed to finally lose a lot of his fear  facing the monster, because (I think) he knew his sister was there with him through the radio. Then the way the scene shifted from Marcus to Regan was so amazing, and seeing their mom shed a tear in the background. I mean.. so good!

Where did the aliens come from?

Where are the human militaries?

Why did they not try to bait the aliens into the ocean after learning that they can't swim? Boats with big speakers, Helicopters, etc. could do that. 

How did other countries and continents got affected?

How do aliens eat and stuff?

Why are they murdering everyone?

Were the people at the docks cannibals? Why did their eyes and skin look so weird? 

How do the aliens reproduce/increase their numbers? 

Where are Emily Blunt's character and her kids doing now?

Emmet and the girl? Will they go back for them and then live on the island?

The sequel failed to answer any question a sequel should answer, and the plot didn't give us anything that we didn't really see in the first movie.

As a standalone movie: 8/10",nmnxqu

2. What did Noah find in the upper levels of the warehouse? Was it emmett's wife?
3. Imagine there will be a 3rd Quiet Place movie, and when they go back to the black kid and white kid that were being hidden in the closet, they will both be a few years older than when they were put in that closet, ahah
4. Lee was the first one to make sure that no one was making any sound, (by placing his index finger in front of his lips) without even having any knowledge that they are sensitive to sounds. He even made that old guy stop his prayer.

I hadn’t watched any trailers before seeing the movie, and the first 10 minutes I was convinced that the movie was a prequel.

Is our military that weak? They clearly figured out that the aliens couldn't swim, so the first line of action would be to hop on those big navy ships to establish a center of command and draft a war plan. They could've easily trapped an alien for testing. Even if their armor is ""indestructible"", just bait an alien into a big cage and subjugate it to different conditions.

h5wukc4,"i was disappointed. i thought this movie was going to be more of a prequel, such as a back and forth between the events after the last movie ended and when the aliens first arrived (the first 10 minutes). i also don’t think there was enough character development with the main guy (i forget his name), for someone who would be such a main part of the story, the first 10 minutes at the baseball game was not enough to establish his relationship with the family and make us care that his family died, why he never went to see if they were still alive, etc. so many dumb decisions in the film too - why did the kid leave the bunker? why did they get in the car with the man blaring the horn? it seemed like there was little flow as well, what was the beginning, the middle, and the end? the island storyline was choppy because one second it was peace on earth and the next the guy dies and we’re supposed to care after knowing him for 15 minutes. it also annoyed me that they skipped over the part where they were first met by the islanders and instead it skipped from them approaching the neighborhood to sitting down and being offered water - what were their reactions? don’t tell us they were surprised, show us.",nmnxqu

They couldn't set up a computer to automate a message about them being on an island? Also I'm not sure I buy the alien riding the boat that whole time to get out at the perfect time. 

How is there a subgroup of weirdos who kidnap people? If someone is about to kidnap you why wouldn't you just scream? Seems better than whatever those weirdos would do to you.

gzq9amf,"Definitely 8-8.5/10, enjoyed the hell out of it. Krasinski can direct and some of the set pieces were gorgeous (opening sequence aside, the scene of Cillian bobbing up in down in the water as the dude he's attached to is getting done was my favorite shot)...but I do have some plot quibbles. 

1. The entire sequence at the dock was sort of lazy. Emmitt warns the family there's no one out there worth saving, but then suddenly he runs around chasing a flash of a little girl? 

2. Whyyyyyy wouldn't the family come up with a plan together once they're safe in the factory? Obviously there's no movie if they don't split up, but still it's a very thin stretch to think Regan would just walk off without telling her mother, especially with the brother in such bad shape. 

3. Yet another alien movie where their weakness is water despite invading a planet 75% made up of it. Also, since we now see a sprinkler system negatively effects their hearing the same as a waterfall, what do they do when it rains or there's a leaky faucet in a nearby sink?

4. Lastly, and I'm aware this is one huge nitpick since the movie was only 90 mins long and only about the family, but where does the island get its food/water/electricity from? 

This is just me thinking about it too hard after seeing it. I really did enjoy it, although I did think as I watched it how dumb the characters were in the 2nd act, haha.",nmnxqu

h0822ei,"Why did the monsters kill the humans indiscriminately without eating them? I feel like they could use an agenda beyond killing. Resources, feeding, etc. 

Why did they try to make Cillian Murphy’s character a reluctant hero? Wouldn’t you want to do something useful after your whole family dies? I think if they wanted to use that trope have his wife still be alive, in the opposite direction somewhere. Give him some stakes. 

That scene where Emily blunt puts down her wedding ring. Why? They could have used that to indicate she’s moving on to Cillian’s character. Felt empty. 

Kill the black guy trope. Uh. Okay. 

Those bad humans. They seemed pretty clumsily written in too. Back story? Are they infected by some alien zombie virus? 

Why not use white noise machines, or live by the waterfall like the first movie?

Some parts of the movie were definitely really stupid. Like the kid leaves the bunker to go explore, only to get a monster lured on him lol. And the colony leader spazzing in the garage for some reason, only to get killed like 5 seconds later lol. Much more dumb stuff throughout

I guess my main problem with the movie is there’s not enough explanation. What is the back story of the monsters? Can someone explain what the end goal is here? Practically no explanations or a plan of how to kill these creatures for good lol. It’s just, let’s get to a radio tower and broadcast this signal… and yeah hopefully that will save people and yeah

The scene with the cross almost made me cry. I just don't get why she left her ring on it. If I were her, I'd want to keep it.

The ending felt very abrupt. I didn't feel like those two monsters being defeated was any more important the other ones they killed. Usually I hate it when movies just stop instead of ending, but after how good the movie was overall, I didn't really care this time.

And now for a joke fan theory I came up with after something my dad said made me laugh.

All the people have to do is play a little baseball and then the monsters will chill out and everything can go back to normal.",nmnxqu

The movie felt a touch threadbare, since so much of it is silent there isn’t MUCH plot or dialogue to allow complexity. But I also love it for that. A great movie to come back to the theaters for- it oozes atmosphere.

Seeing it in a state of the art premium screening with a packed audience is exactly how I envisioned this when the teaser trailer was show in late 2019. I just saw Army of the Dead in theatres which is a full hour longer, but somehow Quiet Place 2 feels like it's over 2 hours(in a good way) I actually like this a lot more than the first one. Just felt more of an emotional connection and sense of dread.

Given the state of the world with a society shell shocked from a lockdown, social unrest, climate collapse, economic anxiety and now the Pentagon/media talking about ""UAP"" alien shit lately; seeing AQP2 felt like there was more weight to it...like it was less escapism, or an added heightened tension and weight to it.

My only complaint is that the second act takes up most of the run time, with the first and third act much shorter bookends...so I can see some people feeling the factory/boiler room section might drag a bit. All I know is I cannot wait for a Part 3. Also \*\*SPOILER\*\* question....

>! Regarding the small island in the third act, how did the pirate straggler dock tribe not attempt to go to the island and take it over? How did the aliens not try and get to the island, as both movies establish these things can swarm anywhere and aren't hampered by water.!<",nmnxqu
gzu78va,I just came back from the theaters. I thought that the sequel was not bad but did not enjoy it as much as the first movie. I would've like to known the origin and what the creatures are and how they landed on Earth. The foreshadowing of the dive scene from the baseball game was pretty epic getting away from the men at the dock. Why does the large frequency annoy the creatures? Can they see or only have a really good sense of hearing? I liked that they showed how the mayhem started. The left the plot hole from the first movie to show it in the sequel.

Are we supposed to believe that it floated there and ended up in that perfect spot (wasn't it docked when they were attacking on the mainland?)  That also seems a bit much.

gzxjoq6,"Having seen the second one twice now, I must say, I really did like it, a LOT. It’s probably just as good as the first but the first is just a hair better if only because it did this concept first, and knocked it out of the park. The opening scene is still the best in the whole movie but the ending was really strong too. The movie overall has a very “straightforwardness” that the first one had as well, I think Krazinski himself being in most of the first one gives it that edge to me, but god damn whereas the first one didn’t leave me NEEDING a followup, this one certainly did and I eagerly await the third part

The music and sound design in both these movies is just so 💋🤌🏻",nmnxqu
gzxo0av,"Loved it, maybe even more than the first one. One point I was a little confused on though. At the end of the first film we see Emily Blunt's character pump the shotgun as a bunch of the monsters head toward the farm.

gzxuj9x,"This movie was fun as hell. The set pieces were expertly filmed. Cillian Murphy was a great addition. Loved the flashback intro. Loved the evolution of both kids. And yet despite all that I’m just a little disappointed overall. I thought the story mirrored the first one a little too much. I appreciate the parallels but wish it had been a little more ambitious (without falling into “make everything bigger and louder” sequel trap). And there weren’t any big surprises. As a result, it felt like it played things a little too safe. The final scene of the original was such an exciting moment the first time I saw it. They found a way to fight the monsters. Get some! How cool is that!? But the ending of part 2 felt like a rehash. It didn’t have the same oomph. The scale was bigger but I guess I was hoping for a greater escalation or revelation of some sort. The monsters feel pretty nerfed now that they have the sound weapon. I guess I was hoping the storytellers would come up with a way to counterbalance the sound device and put the heroes back on the defensive. Instead they just split them up and put them into precarious scenarios via some borderline-implausible sequences of events.  

Anyway, kick ass movie that was thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. But felt like a bit of a missed opportunity. I hope Krasinski makes at least one more of these so we get a solid trilogy.",nmnxqu

I would feel hard done by paying for this tbh. And this was the first time at the cinema for a long time 2-3y+

I guess I should have known better given the first part. This was worse IMO, the plot literally LITERALLY went nowhere. there were like 3 locations and was over way to quick without actually accomplishing anything.

This felt like a slightly better CGI version of a tv show episode/walking dead

I get that the silence / little dialogue is part of 'the quiet place' ethos, but felt it was literally 1.5 hours of filler that didnt do anything more then the first part

&#x200B;

I have exactly ONE complaint with this movie. It's that it got so pants-shittingly intense that I had to go pee for the rest of the movie. Other than that, 10 out of 10 (BTW, this was my first movie I saw in theaters since Rise of Skywalker, sometime in the end of December back in 2019. Yeesh. Well, don't think that colored my opinion much, watch movies wherever you're most comfortable.)  
  
Anyways, like with any sequel to any movie that's near and dear to my heart, I was equal parts excited, scared, and curious about it's sequel. Could it live up to the standards set by the first, continue the story in what isn't just a retread, and perhaps even surpass it's predecessor? I'm happy to report that yes, it is in fact, THAT good. Better than the first one? At the moment I think they're at the same level, I don't have enough distance from this one to make a judgement on that front. But on it's own merits, it delivers and then some.  
  
If you're watching this movie because of the first, then chances are you're here for some intense-ass shit, and trust me when I say, you'll get plenty of it here. Krasinski and company find clever new predicaments for our characters to get into, and because we know these movies don't fuck around, the threat of a swift death hangs over the heads of our characters at all times... and even worse things beyond that.  
  
But besides the tension, what carries us as an audience through that intensity are the same characters we love and empathize with from the first, and a few new ones beyond that. The aftermath of the first film is addressed as our ensemble ventures off beyond the sand path and into a brave, dangerous, new world. Across the board the acting is phenomenal once again, with not a single word or action feeling fake. Their grief, solidarity, and indomitable will to soldier on in the face of insurmountable odds makes us want to cheer them on, the only thing stopping us being the fact that making any noise would, well, you know already.   
  
In terms of faults, I'd have very few with the film itself. Some scares feel a little cheap, especially when it does an exquisite job of building tension without them. In hindsight some events/choices/characters either come out of nowhere, aren't addressed much, or not given time to develop. And my main issue would be that, well, I'm greedy. As a greedy moviegoer, I want a sequel to be bigger. That's obviously a nitpick, and a problem with me and not the film. But this movie feels less like an upgrade and more like, well, a continuation. Again, this isn't an issue with the film itself, and more with the expectation. It's a nothing flaw.  
  
All in all, there's few movies better to herald the return of the movie theater than A Quiet Place: Part 2. As a big-screen summer movie event, it delivers on all bases you expect and then some. It'll make you sweat, it'll make you cry, it'll make you want to cheer, it's everything you'll ever want, and certainly everything I ever needed. If at all possible where you live, don't miss this one.",nmnxqu
gzqgnj2,"After 1.5 years I finally went to see a movie in a theater, and it was amazing! The movie is great! 

The opening scene set the bar so high for the rest of the movie, it might be my favorite part honestly. Oh and the kids and mom were SO badass when the boy stepped into a bear trap. I was snapping my fingers left and right.",nmnxqu
gzuynvv,"I liked the movie, as much as I liked the original, but just can't help being slightly annoyed that there's no explanation how these things managed to take out the planet's defences so easily.

If there was time to make news reports, which there was, then where are the reports of military bases being overrun by hundreds of these things simultaneously?

If they took out each base singularly then it would take forever, giving the military a chance to develop a damn good plan to fight back, given that their heads can so easily be sploded with a hunting rifle.

I'm pretty sure a single Apache helicopter could decimate these things, and I'm fairly sure it would be very easy to create sound nades to attract the creatures in to a kill zone, given how they attacked the mobile phone in the shop.

And I'm sorry, but even with girl power, there's just no way a mother with a new born is going to walk across the land safely. Babies cry, they cry because they want to, they just cry.

And since when is the forest floor swept so clean that there's no leaves and twigs to walk on. It would be exhausting to to watch every single footstep to avoid the slightest sound while carrying a baby.

It's a great movie, but there's some things that just glare out while watching it, and especially when you sit down after.",nmnxqu
gzyq3s4,"Thoroughly enjoyed it and it's clearly a great movie, so let me concentrate on my gripes for discussion's sake.

&#x200B;

1. As mentioned, featured killings of the two black guys seemed easily avoided by JK. Not sure what happened there with the decisions.
2. The aliens arriving on Earth means they are obviously extremely tech savvy, but they don't appear tech savvy or reliant at all in practice. Feels a little disconnected. UNLESS, these beings aren't the real aliens and merely the scouts/killing machines sent down by the beings to clear the scene for safety or something
3. Yes, the son's decisions were forced/contrived in the warehouse

But a part of me wishes this was the first movie of the series, with a more heavy emphasis on the introduction of the monsters that we saw in this movie. Easily the best part of the film. Then have the first movie as the sequel, of course certain things would have to change but I feel like it would make everything flow better",nmnxqu
gzsa77v,"Maybe I’m in the minority but I didn’t like this one as much. It was enjoyable but the characters felt kind of dumb.

Why would Marcus leave the hatch to go explore when taking care of a baby by himself? He saw all these dead bodies which led me to believe that Emmett by weirder than let on but they didn’t really do anything with it.

Correct me if I’m wrong but the editing at the end felt really disjointed. There are three threads being poked at: Emmett and Lee on the docks, Evelyn going to the pharmacy, and Marcus outside the hatch. Emmett and Lee arrive on the island in the middle of night while Evelyn and Marcus start getting attacked. Somehow several hours pass, Emmett and Man on Island have a full conversation about what happened in the beginning why Evelyn and Marcus are still somehow being attacked. 

The movie pulled me out when we find out Lee is now the savior by finding out how to kill these things. Also pulled me out when the creature some how floats to the island by chance. Also a whole town vs one creature. It’s not like they don’t know about how the creatures work since they lock the kids inside a closest to be safe. Man on Island had to keep his voice down.

More a nitpick about end of the world stories but how is the pharmacy not looted completely after a year and a half? I have no doubt someone would take all of medicine.

While I didn’t hate the ending it was abrupt. 

With all that complaining, the first half was really enjoyable. I did like seeing all the drugged out people on the dock. Also nice to know there was a safe haven. Always love Cillian Murphy in whatever he does, he had a great father role in this one. They’re of sound was great in this, just like the first movie.

Even Cillian Murphy’s character seemed weirdly unknowable even though he was obviously a family friend of some kind which seemed odd.

I also love that this movie hasn’t tried to address what the monsters are exactly, helps keep them more terrifying",nmnxqu

I don't remember if she had walking scenes with John but it didn't give me the same feeling. Probably because they weren't as close. It made me think that I honestly wouldn't care what Ellie and Joel would look like if they made a movie for it. I just want them to act well. Also, Cillian being in another kind of survival movie besides 28 Days Later made me happy.""

h089j1n,"things that didn't make sense about this movie:
1. why would emmet be signaling to them with a fire if his intention was not to connect with the family? like if u don't have enough supplies to take care of people/ aren't expecting them to show up at ur warehouse and set off ur bear trap, don't fire signal back asshole
2. the mom leaving her wedding ring on the wood block? if the world is ending and my partner sacrificed themselves to save me and my children, im wearing that ring til the day i am pounced upon by sound sensitive monsters.
3. emmet. just him as a character. the movie should have been about the family now that they lack a father figure, and how they can carry on his hopeful legacy without him there physically. it was a complete throw away to just be like ""yeah they can't survive without a man, so lets say this guy lives a couple miles away"". he was also just a sucky guy. 
4. EVERYONE should just know sign language by this point. if there are still survivors out in a world where silence is the key to not dying, everyone should have turned their phones all the way down, and watched some basic conversational sign language videos so they could keep up communication without immediately dying. or just make up their own silent language. the loud whispering in this sequel really made it a lot less believable. 
5. why has the son either been sick or injured during both films now? i wanna know what his purpose is in the movie. i know that the son is usually the one who ""becomes the man of the house"", but regan does a much better job at stepping up when it comes to saving the world. 
6. dealing with a baby in this kind of world is literally insane and so unreal. 
7. the way they all kept separating from each other. like they should have either all gone together to help regan and put the baby in a sound proof papoose and just pretended it wasn't there. except one part where it inevitably screams and gives away their location (to be cliche maybe the baby voice is so strong it blows a monsters head off) or the mom should have taught the son how to take care of the baby better so when the perilous times came, she could fight and kill monsters with regan while the son took on the fatherly role that apparently had been missing. 

idk man. its such a huge loss when sequels take place immediately following the action in the movie they come after. it would have been cool to see it pick up after 20 more days or so, the now family of 4 living in a new smaller place, making do and carrying on their father's legacy even though hes only there in spirit. switching the marital roles that were once hunter/ protector and forager/ home maker into a more dynamic family that has basically transitioned into a well oiled killing machine plus a baby.",nmnxqu
h0b1g7p,"I honestly wasn't a big fan of this one. I felt like what made the first one good was how they used silence and a lack of talking to create tension with any small sound. This felt like they basically gave up on that once they were in that bunker just saying ""They can't hear us unless they are right above us, so lets just talk."" 

The characters got away with many minor sounds with so much grace from the monsters where they would have been killed immediately in the first one. Cillian Murphy was good, but I feel like we didn't get enough backstory too really care about his family. Did we even see any of their faces? 

And I get that getting your leg caught in a bear trap is probably the worst feeling, but it seemed like he was trying to be loud. Raising your head up as high and shrieking like that when you know that there are monsters that specifically kill sound, the day after your dad was killed for making sound at a monster? Some sound is definitely going to happen but holy shit kid...

Also, no one's leg is safe in this. The son with the bear trap, Cillian Murphy at the end when he shuts the door. The mom in that little tomb thing at the end. Djimon Hounsou getting pulled under the door. So, many leg injuries.",nmnxqu

I couldn't survive exiting any room in my house without getting slaughtered by one of these monsters because they all make a little bit of sound.

h04hgy8,"A great sequel and, dare I say, better than the original imo. I enjoyed the expanded lore, new locations, and an actual continuation of the story. The characters are actually developed further and I'm glad it wasn't just a retread of the previous movie. Not to mention I was still on the edge of my seat and I feel a bit lucky to have had a quiet audience.

I say I like it more than the original since many people criticized the practicality of how the family survived all that time on the farm. Remember the ""why didn't they just move near the waterfall"" meme? While in this film, a suspension of disbelief isn't required to follow along and tie things together.

If I had to criticize anything, maybe the pacing? Like while there were intense scenes throughout the film, I felt like the movie actually started to pick up near the end and I felt it was abrupt. Yes it's a cliffhanger but I still felt we had another 10-15 min left before it cut away.  EDIT: I should also mention I didn't get Marcus's reasoning for leaving the baby to just walk around the compound and for Djimon Hounsou's character to suddenly acting foolish and getting killed abruptly.

Really hope the third movie, if they make it, ties it up all nicely and satisfyingly.",nmnxqu
h0etip6,"Saw this with the kids. Collection of random thoughts:

--It was fun, I certainly don't regret seeing it, but I definitely feel a bit disappointed.

--This isn't so much of a sequel as it is direct continuation of the first film. You could take the flashback sequence and insert it at the front of the first film, then just attach this movie to where the first one ends, and it would be completely seamless. There's almost no difference in tone, in pacing, in set-up ... it just feels like one big movie split in two (I guess the title makes sense!). I realized this and kind of rolled with it, but my kids actually felt really frustrated at the end and expressed repeatedly that it needed to be longer and more needed to happen.

--There better be a part 3 ....

--Cillian Murphy completely exposed Krasinki's shortcomings as a leading man in this. He's the best part of the whole movie.

--They should have just named Murphy's character 'Joel' and called it a day. I actually wish they'd leaned into The Last of Us vibes harder as it was a better portion of the film than Emily Blunt's fairly static scenes where we have to keep cutting back to her often inane-feeling shenanigans in the weird missile silo looking complex.

--The movie is waaaaaaaaaaay too short for all the plot strands as almost nothing is adequately developed. I see that Krasinski has sole writing credit ... yeah, get someone to help you with structure next time, John. He knows how to direct a scene tautly, has a good eye for framing (or his DP does), but we keep flitting from one idea to the next with no meat on the bones. Why couldn't we spend some more time with the feral boat people? Maybe develop an actual human antagonist? Maybe they could have followed them to the island village? Could we possibly have seen more of Joel and Deaf Ellie bonding a bit? Sure wish Djimon and the village was explored a bit more.

--Why are the island folk playing Beyond the Sea? Why not just put instructions on a loop? If they're trying to be oblique cause they want to stay hidden, why broadcast anything at all?

--I was dreading Deaf Ellie being a major character in this for exactly the reason displayed in the movie. She grinds exposition to a halt and it quickly becomes frustrating as hell. So long as she and Joel are doing something or in peril, the movie crackles. Once we have to deal with communicating with her, it's irritating. I already dealt with this in one film, I totally didn't want to see it again. She needed to stay in that bunker cause she's the worst choice for exploring in this nightmare world. The goddamn clickers would eat her for breakfast. She should have been the one to get her foot clawed while either Sequel Poppins or her son head out to find help.

--I loved that the monsters couldn't swim. Awesome. That entire boat sequence was great.

--The pharmacy wasn't picked over? Bull. Fucking. Shit. Before Krasinski sits down and writes anything else in this world he needs to play through The Last of Us and watch the first six seasons of The Walking Dead.

--I could have lived with the entire movie being a prequel of the fall of the world. Have it end where the first one starts. That opening may have been the strongest part of the film cause it didn't try to replicate the tone and pacing of the first.",nmnxqu

The boat people make sense in that we can't understand their motives because they do not speak. That is scary and something possible because of how people have to live now. They may have different ways to communicate that they created. 

Them not going to the island is harder to explain. The ocean would be a natural sound barrier so living in boats makes sense. I suppose that they may believe the island is no better and starting the engines would likely attract the monsters.",nmnxqu

gzt0gx2,"Loved the first film and really enjoyed this. 
Felt more action packed in a lot of scenes than the first film but still had some super tense scenes.

Had a few issues. Like it was cool that this was a straight continuation of the first film. Carries on right from where that ended but you can see that the kids have gotten noticeably older, especially Noah Jupe. Even more noticeable if you watched the first just before this as a double bill which i think a lot of people did.
Even more distracting in the flashback scene at the beginning.

The last scene, even though it was really close to the ending of the first film but amped up (literally) was pretty badass and i was really loving it. I was really surprised when the credits hit though. Was thinking ""that's not it is it? Oh, it is, ok..."". Don't know how they should have ended it but i felt like i could have watched more.

I wasn't completely sure about how the monster got onto the island when Cillian Murphy saw the boat. Since they can't swim was it hanging onto a boat that traveled there or something?",nmnxqu

gzt2ifo,"I thought it was decent but ultimately pretty unremarkable. Technically well-crafted and solidly acted but the script just felt really lacking on a plot/character level. Felt more like a rollercoaster ride than the first film. Felt like a grab-bag of post-apocalyptic cliches without much substance to it.

A lot of the script felt very Screenwriter 101 - the laughable ""dive"" callback, the parallel action for most of the movie, which I think harmed the central dynamic.

Was really surprised how Emily Blunt was off-screen for a huge chunk of the film, and Cillian Murphy more-or-less had the same amount of screen time by the end.

Was hoping for a lot more than this, but I couldn't call it bad by any means. Like a 6.5/10.",nmnxqu
gztk0os,"Great movie, one issue I had though was why did Lee leave the O2 tanks in the pharmacy in the first movie? And why was the pharmacy still stocked anyway? If I was them I would have taken both the tanks and all supplies so I wouldn’t have to worry about venturing out.

Emily Blunt says, “Please, there are people out there, people worth saving.” Her delivery and acting in that scene made me excited about watching the movie but the line in the movie is different!! I know it happens often with movies but still!! That one changed line in the movie completely changes the context lol.",nmnxqu
h01nv8k,"Can someone please explain a couple things:

How did the alien drive the boat all the way to the island? If the boat started at the mainland, the waves would keep pushing it into the mainland, not towards the island.

Having set up their base by the ocean, none of the bad guys realized the aliens couldn't swim? None of them thought, hey, maybe we should take the boats to that island with the red light blinking radio tower?

Also, why are there bad guys? It seems like 99.9% of the world population died within hours. Meaning there's loot to your hearts content just sitting there. Everywhere. More than enough to share and go around. What does killing people accomplish when resources are not at all scarce? Even if it was just for the fun of it, wouldn't being a bad guy be the worst profession to go into considering almost every encounter will almost certainly result in noise from the victim leading to the death of your bad guy posse exactly like what happened in the movie? Maybe they decided yesterday to be bad guys and Emmitt and the girl were gonna be their first victims.

Speaking of Emmitt, the man just yolos around with shoes. Either he doesn't give a flying **** or it doesn't really matter if you wear shoes or not. Especially considering a pair of moccasins are probably just as quiet as barefeet, is it likely the family didn't wear shoes just for fun?

Lots more questions, but does anyone have any thoughts on these?",nmnxqu
h021l80,"So I thought the movie was pretty good, acting was incredible.  Not really a fan of horror films although this was more a thriller with ~2 jumpscares.

My only gripe which I told my wife on the way home was the movie took me out of the experience a couple of times trying to emphasize something obvious (imo).  Maybe I'm too analytical but alot of the plot devices didn't merit these 5 second zoom in and pauses to say, ""Wait, Look!  X is not/will need Y, oh noes!""

h0544fl,"Thought this was an excellent sequel. I do think the first is perhaps a better made, more cohesive film. Yet, my personal preference leads me to liking the sequel more. I enjoyed the bit of expansion in worldbuilding, excited to see more of it in the next film. Knowing there are some dangerous groups of people out there heightens the sense of danger, so hope that’s explored more in particular. 

Really enjoyed every storyline and thought Millicent Simmonds’ Regan especially carried the film wonderfully. Regan and Emmett’s plot had some major Last of Us vibes, in the best way possible. I was very relieved they didn’t kill off Emmett as I feared his arc would lead. 

Assuming a third film happens and it doesn’t leave the family separated too long, I’m really interested to see how Emmett will fit into that family dynamic. But I’m just excited for more, I think one last film to conclude the story is all we need. I hope they don’t extend it past a trilogy.",nmnxqu

h08d0gz,"I loved the movie, but one of my friends pointed out a pretty major mistake: Didn’t Regan cut the power cord for the amp at the beginning? Because if so, it shouldn’t work after she disconnected it. Anyone have a way to disprove this?",nmnxqu
h08msvb,"I have two issues, critiques, confusions? with this movie. First and foremost, why did Regan (Millicent Simmons) NEED to go find the community BY HERSELF? I understand for her character development she felt the need to so that she could fill her dad's shoes, but I don't know. She didn't even make an attempt to talk to her mom about it? Only her brother and Emmett were resistant to the idea, and her brother only because she didn't want her doing it by herself. You could also argue that dealing with the baby AND the brother's mangled foot travelling soon would be incredibly hard, but why couldn't Regan just wait? I suppose the urgency was to provide a way for survivors to combat the Death Angels, but that reason wasn't made very clear. So it seems like Regan is just being stupidly stubborn in trying to prove something. I may have missed something though, so please tell me if tat is the case.

My second issue is how underdeveloped Emmett's character, particularly his grief from his sin and wife dying, was. I very easily get into characters' shoes and deeply eel their emotions, but it was hard to with him. And if they had done a better job of making me feel his pain and loss and the conflicting distrust of people it encouraged in him, I might have better connected with Emmett's development in coming to realize how unfounded his complete mistrust of others is after he initially hesitantly helps Regan seek out other survivors. 

Overall I did like the movie, the tension was crazy throughout, the scares good, particularly the complete and utter brutality which we saw the Death Angels slaughtering people almost as if for sport. I also think the ending was abrupt, and would have liked maybe to see the aftermath of the attack on the village, but I am fairly confident there will be a third movie that will pick right where we left off, and so this won't really be that much of an issue anymore. Even from the first to the second movie, I think watching them immediately back to back hightens both the tension and the character development.",nmnxqu

h09qw7n,"Just got back from it. I've been to a couple dozen movies since the pandemic started (as theaters permitted), but this was definitely the biggest crowd yet. Interesting that Chris Nolan wasn't able to pull it off, but John Krasinski did, but I guess the vaccine accounts for a lot of that. I never understood why studios felt like they had to rush out all the blockbusters before it was safe to do so.

It was a decent movie, but not quite as impactful as the first one. I liked that they depicted the events of the first day, but the rest of it felt very familiar somehow. I don't know if it's because I played The Last of Us Part II recently, but some of the locations seemed like they were ripped straight out of that game. Luckily, beyond the two scenes showcased in the promos 10,000 times (driving away from the bus; the tripwire in the junkyard), I still had no idea what to expect plotwise.

I can't help but wonder what happens next, now that the radio station is emitting high-frequency waves. How would anyone but them know to use it to dispatch the creatures? And what will Regan do now, without her seemingly only hearing aid device? Makes me wonder if there will be another sequel coming up, where they seek out more survivors or whatever.

h3i31jd,"Radio transmitter plan plot-hole? 

So at the end of the first film an amplified hearing aid that feeds back, will hurt the aliens. 

In Part 2, using the guitar amp to make a louder portable version makes sense. However the plan to transmit the signal over radio does not work. As it will only transmit a radio signal of the hearing aid sound and not PA the sound across the surrounding area as a loud sound.

The only people that would benefit are people who happened to have the radio turned on and no one would do that as they would risk attack.  Its exactly the same as how the song was hard to notice that drew them to the radio station in the first place.

So at the end of the film. They killed the alien that was attacking them at the radio station and the one back at the factory. So they moved the portable guitar amp away from the factory to get to a transmitter to broadcast the same signal back to a radio at the factory.

h3lywkc,"What I don't get is, the opening scene they all knew to be super quiet for some reason in the bar. Like these monsters are wreaking havoc, you'd never sit and try hope they walk on by.

h3mw3qu,"The movie was cool, but the entire premise of the monsters being so susceptible to high frequency sounds didn't really make any sense. If they were so easy to kill that a kid could easily dispatch them, then there is no way they would have overtaken the military.... Furthermore, nations not affected by them would surely figure out how to kill them pretty quickly and send aid to affected areas.

h3q2p81,"####I hope there is a third one.

But...qp2 is 50% inferior to the excellent original and not a horror film. Qp2 is an action film with loads of talking, bangs, slams and noise.  

Sadly it doesnt have the majesty or creativity of the first film and it's greatest failure is making the monsters a non entity.  Rather than developing their story / lore the monsters are no longer hidden in shadow but in plain sight for most of the film.  Worse still the night time scares of qp1 are replaced with almost entirely day time scenes.

Furthermore the cgi though competent and believable at times is clearly cgi much more so than the first film.  

The result is it's simply not scary and even  tension is mostly lost outside if a few scenes  but....that is not to say its not fun and well made. The story is almost non existent but the acting and characters are engaging.  The films does suffer for not having the director as it's lead and his replacement delivers a muted performance.  

Despite enjoying qp2 the most annoying part for me is that 24hrs after the tragedy of the first film which was a direct result of idiots going off and doing idiot things on their own against their own rules.  Is that the story again revolves around idiots going off and doing idiot things against their own rules.

The latter is fine for a horror film which qp1 certainly is but qp2 is not horror so it just cones across as forced and as with the lack of creature development it seems that the director has run out of new cool ideas.

Also there seems to be a genuine issue with continuity.  In qp1 it is clearly established that not only will the  monsters go near and in water but they will willingly swim under water. But in the sequel they claim they are scared if water and seem to have an aversion to water.  

Beyond that confusion many of the great ideas in the first movie are abandoned or simply developed no further.  Which is a shame as there is a lot to develop which I hope will be done so in the third film.

The two new characters are meaningless and one is established as wise and capable only to like the children for the sake of the plot behave in a stupid way ignoring the established rules much to his and the films detriment.

The actors have little to do and so characters like blunt and her son spend much if the film with no impetus.  That lack of urgency which the qp1 delivered in spades hurts the film.

Also I had an issue with sound ironically where I couldn't understand what they were saying for the most part as they softly mumble. This wasn't an issue in the first film as they just didn't speak.  It distracts from the films core identity and what made it so successful.

The ending isn't half as clever or exciting and reuses the same ideas to a lesser effect though we see the daughter effectively become the capable bad ass she will need to be to lead the him an race in quiet place 3 (a deaf John Connor?).

Overall I'd give it 7/10 for a couple of well made scenes and because of the girls performance who does an excellent job for the second time.",nmnxqu

A lot of people on here are questioning the science of the creatures “hearing”, saying it doesn’t really work, but I noticed a lot more “chirping” from them in this one. Is it more high powered sonar than just hearing?",nmnxqu

h3xt6lz,"Fantastic movie; I loved it and the first. One problem I have and have had since the first is that the aliens don’t seem to have a real motive, even one as simple and primal as feeding. It’s clear that it’s a departure from invasion style movies where the aliens are much smarter than humans and have advanced technology, and is more like a predator being introduced into an environment with no competition. But they seem to just wantonly kill things for no reason. They don’t eat humans, they kill them just because they make noise. It’s not like they’re out for a hunt, they just kinda seem to be doing god-knows-what off-screen until something makes a noise, and then they sprint in from off-screen to maul it to death, and then sprint off to wherever they hang out when they’re not killing whatever makes the slightest noise.",nmnxqu
h3yxcfq,"The start was awesome. Was looking forward to it lasting a lot longer. It felt VERYY similar to the start of The Last of Us 1 where things go to shit as a very quick rate and people are just being taken out by clickers coming out of nowhere. Super fast action, no breaks, and awesome camera work just like the game. Even the car scenes felt similar. Then it also jumps forward in time to after things are settled.

But I do hate how movies try to drag out very urgent life critical actions to make things seeeem more dramatic. Like at the end where Regan/the girl was in the radio booth just staring at the monster as its starting to rip the guy apart, and her mum elsewhere, instead of just moving her arm to the microphone and blasting the noise over the radio.

Should have been turn the speaker on, move your arm to the microphone and play the sound. A quick swift 2 second thing but it's like she was taking in the moment while the monster is coming close to killing them. Wheres the urgency??

The first third was awesome but then dropped off a bunch. The pier scene was awesome though, another scene that felt very similar to scenes from The Last of Us 1 and 2.",nmnxqu

Still, none of the questions that first movie left behind were answered. Where is tha air forces, why they aren't bombing creatures from above?

h5bixya,"So, the monsters are seen in the beginning of the movie disrupting the radio of the cars and of Emmett’s radio because they pulse electromagnetic waves.

Then, after some dialogue, Evelyn opens the box and shows him the baby. And right after that, there is a quick scene of Emmett sitting just inside the round door of the sound proof pipe, breathing hard and thinking. You see his profile in the shadows and darkness, but the round door is cracked open and beyond the door you can see relative brightness, a slice of blue (sky?), and what looks like the wall of a building with a window and an air conditioner hanging out of it. It is all slightly blurred, but that door should only open to the dingy room right outside the pipe, not to the outside. Any ideas?",nmnxqu

I realize it doesn't matter much to the plot, but I wonder if the monsters arrived here accidentally, perhaps by hitching a ride on an asteroid or something, or if they were dumped here by an intelligent race as a method of cleansing the planet of native fauna before some sort of takeover. (I am aware that would not make sense from an extraterrestrial perspective, and that there is nothing we or our planet could possibly offer to any alien race advanced enough to get here. But movies still use that premise.)

Anyway, I enjoyed A Quiet Place 2 for what it was: A tense SF/action drama. But I didn't think it was as incredible as the hype suggested, as it failed to meaningfully provide any further context on what was happening, didn't have a larger point, and didn't cover much ground.

Really, what happened in this movie?

Emily Blunt and her kids walked to Cillian Murphy's industrial facility, the girl left on her own to go find an island, and Murphy went after her. Blunt went to go get meds for her son. Then the characters fought the aliens in two different scenes, and it ended.

He's a terrible actor, doesn't matter what movie he's in he always plays his roles in a whiny, pathetic and very annoying way. 

Simmonds is fine but her character is terribly written. She's incapable of ever listening to anyone. She's the most stubborn and stupid child ever written. She's the cause of LITERALLY every thing terrible that happens to people. This movie she goes on a trek that is completely unbelievable and nonsensical putting her life in danger. Thus causing Emmett to put his life in danger trying to save her. Her going on this quest caused all those people on the island to die. She's literally a walking stupid person that gets people killed everywhere she goes. I get her goal is the main goal of the movie but in that kind of universe a girl who can't hear a damn thing going out on her own not knowing whats out there is beyond stupid and bad writing. In the first movie it's her that gets her little brother killed by stupidly giving him back the toy. I can't even count how many times she doesn't listen to people in that movie when they tell her to stay somewhere. I mean her decision to hide on top of the silo inevitably puts them in a situation that gets their father killed. She's a walking disaster.",nmnxqu

h00hv74,"When Lee got up from the stands and started to gather his kids and leave I thought ""He's the only smart one"" but then one by one more and more people in the crowd also started getting up and heading for the exit.

h05p9tp,"My only complaint about Day 1—and it’s a minor complaint—they seemed to figure out the whole sounds thing a little too quickly. Would have loved to see the carnage of people screaming, running away, firing at the aliens, etc.",nmnxqu

h1gn36u,I liked that we got a bit of origin but what I’d love to know is whether they were meteors or whether they were ships of some sort.,nmnxqu
h0ie364,"Dude with all the fuxking movies we've seen about it?

It is either end of the world asteroid or alien invasion",nmnxqu
h3jpnpz,"I saw a meteor engulfed in fire slowly come into the atmosphere  and hit the water a couple of miles offshore into the ocean along with several thousand people at a carnival, for 30 seconds all I thought was a huge tidal wave was about to come and bury the town in water.  But then scientist me  said dude that was likely the size of a baseball and it burning in the atmosphere made it look huge .  relax.  Then I got upset I had a 4k 360 camera in my hand I failed to turn on.",nmnxqu
h3sse41,"True, but the reality is everyone would have their phones out filming it",nmnxqu
hhqdok2,I wanted the whole movie to be this! To see how they go about the first few days and figure out what the creatures are attracted to etc,nmnxqu
h4ptprn,Yeah it was way too real and that's why it fucking scarred me man,nmnxqu
h53z9m8,It looked like a giant meteor when it landed. I think some people in real life would have started going towards the landing site out of curiosity. Meteors aren't usually a threat after they've landed (unless they have aliens on them).,nmnxqu
h3rpqic,That was by far the best part of the movie for me. The beginning. The second you see one of the creatures the immersion is kind of broken. All they do is clobbering people to left and right. They aren't hunting. They make no sense at all and just screams poor writing.,nmnxqu
h3luoj7,"What I don't get is, how did they know to keep quiet in the bar?",nmnxqu

h5lmxb4,"I dunno I don’t think it was slow enough. I would think people would stand around for longer with their phones and be confused. It was kinda weird how everyone juste of  up and started moving to their cars without much drama like robots. Like why do you need to get to your car right away if the meteor wasn’t heading your way? It looked like it was quite far away, they didn’t feel impact. Not even 5 mins later the aliens got to them and slashing up the place already.",nmnxqu
gzxyiua,"I think there would be a lot more panic. People were just casually walking away, must have never seen Deep Impact or Armageddon",nmnxqu
hkbb7q1,"I thought it was stupid. They only started panicking when the first monster showed up. When the meteor came down looking like the end of existence, they all quietly, in unison, stood up and casually walked to the cars like ""well I guess the game is over"". That was funny af.",nmnxqu
h4x0yo5,"That scene was pretty good, but i would like to see the military. Especially aviation. What were they doing all this time? They are unreachable to the creatures and can bomb them from above.",nmnxqu

gzxgjbt,"That was my thought too, there is no way that the whole world is gone. Australia might be easy to get back or something like New Zealand has some sort of corruption.",nmnxqu
gzzd7o3,"Here is my theory about military, military wouldn't think about the sound reverb thing at first and we all know what military will do first to the aliens. With all firepower and sounds produced by that the aliens attacked them first instead of remote area where the movie take place. And military will prioritize big city to protect first which didn't explored in the movie (I hope the sequel  will explore that). That explain why there is less alien on remote areas and government involvement, I think big cities and military is broken to the point they can't help remote areas.",nmnxqu

h09xmb9,"Exactly. From what we learn here, there's no way this was a world-ending event. It just seems that way because we're following the struggles of a family from a small town in the middle of nowhere and they're cut off from the rest of civilization.",nmnxqu
h0nun7o,"The first movie features newspaper clippings saying the military knows sound is what they are attracted to. This is the detail that breaks the premise, in my opinion. When in the history of the world has a military force seen their enemy has a very obvious handicap, and not went out of their way to exploit it. I find it hard to believe the military’s first course of action wouldn’t be to blast various frequencies constantly.",nmnxqu
h04wza6,Wasn’t very bright of them to come to a planet that is mostly water,nmnxqu
h01rkt3,"> What about Hawaii, Japan or other island territories?? Are they having Sunday barbecues while mainland people eat each other?

I mean....we don't know. We've only seen a very small fraction of the world. Possibly those areas are doing better. Also possible that the meteors that crashed down and brought them landed in a thousand other places and eradicated them, too.  Not everything is meant to be explained.",nmnxqu
h27aooe,"Why the cryptic song message?  They only want people who are good at puzzles to be saved?

Also, how did the monsters get to the island?  Did they drive that boat?

Also, when the boy was looking around Cillian Murphy's stuff and saw a dead person on the table.... was this explained?  Is it his dead wife he's keeping?",nmnxqu
h09qvtq,"Eh I mean, if a creature landed on them initially, they're toast. 


But getting to an island that they didn't initially land on would lead to start we saw in the movie. 


It makes sense",nmnxqu
h0nuun0,"Japan is big enough some of these creatures probably landed there. But yeah, Hawaii is probably chilling.",nmnxqu
h21yutw,"Same here lol like is Australia like having huge parties and thinking “wtf is happening in the US, someone should really help them out”",nmnxqu
h00mnff,Yes my husband said Hawaii was partying.,nmnxqu
h18irgd,">What about Hawaii, Japan or other island territories??

The monsters initially launched from the sky. It makes sense that they'd land on any island with a sufficient population, like Hawaii. 

If an island filled with vacation rentals typically only has a few people on it, then perhaps it wasn't big enough to become it's own alien destination. Then later when 100 more humans show up, it will be too late for the aliens to go there. 

It could also be the case that aliens keep launching onto new areas that humans are gathering (so anytime a successful group of humans gets organized, they get whack-a-moled by a new drop from space)",nmnxqu
h1yija8,"This is what didn't make sense to me. Did the monsters crash in several parts of the world. Because if they only crashed in the US, and they can't swim, how did they get to Europe, Asia, and Africa?",nmnxqu
h0hdrf5,Just a wild guess but as the meteor only landed in the USA maybe the rest of world just quarantined the Americas and stopped anyone trying to get near including the remains of the US military.,nmnxqu
h0spnpa,The old guy was watching the new about an explosion in Shanghai which was probably an alien meteor crash.,nmnxqu
h1pgbds,Yeah that's the part that made the least sense. I feel like that would've been abused to shit. I feel like big populated islands the creatures would've gone too but everyone should've been going to smaller islands like the one in the movie. Ridiculously overpowered.,nmnxqu
h33al0p,Most island territories can’t support their populations without imports so they’ll probably go through their own shit unless a creature managed to sneak on a boat over there,nmnxqu
h3conw0,"well one would assume 1 or 2 alien meteoroids landed on those ""islands""(they are still big pieces of land).",nmnxqu
h1cxq9l,[deleted],nmnxqu
h1vzq4e,"I actually kinda hope this the case as a setup for the trilogy. 

Maybe our characters discover these offshore communities, but they were so decimated by the initial attack that they are just struggling to survive, focused on creating enough food for their own population. 

With no means to launch and outward attack and not wanting to run the risk of accidentally bringing back the creatures to their safe lands they chose to do the selfish thing and 'stay quiet'.

Our characters bring the new scambler frequency to their attention and now the world has the means to push back on the Aliens. 

It gives our characters access to more resources and makes any prospect of killing the invaders once and for all a real possibility.",nmnxqu
h3dolau,"My assumption is because they're from a small town they're cut off from the rest of society, and the gov isn't as concerned about the small town while they're focused on saving the cities. And after a year of survival alone, these people kind of just expected no one else to be out there",nmnxqu
h3gqmnp,Maybe aliens landed on some of the bigger islands.,nmnxqu
h3vjspk,Also they can apparently be killed by a small piece of flimsy conduit swung by a child… how did they survive the military?,nmnxqu
h3zukyg,Assuming the ones we see are the only alien species that landed. There's also the notion of perhaps there's a queen that's a bad mf (and can fly),nmnxqu
h4byznh,"Also if you're in big cities I would think high-rises and skyscrapers would be the safest places to live.

These creatures don't seem smart enough to open doors or figure out the elevator system or where the emergency stairway is, which also have doors usually metal ones too for fireproofing.

You could be on a 12-story high-rise and have big parties pissing them off on the rooftops. Or use it as a strategic point of attack and drop grenades on these things or bundles of c4.",nmnxqu
h4pu4lx,"I imagine that since the creatures seemed to ""land"" in multiple places like China, New York, etc, that large islands had creatures land while small islands were safe zones. So there are definitely people out there, just in small numbers and very spread out.",nmnxqu
h5lo4yk,Honestly in real life yes. But I’m tired of seeing the military in end of the world type of movies. It been over played and I guess it doesn’t go with the aesthetic with this movie.,nmnxqu
h5luwtg,"A lot of this movie makes no sense, lol.

The water thing for example. Most of the planet is water, lol.

How did these things get here? On a spaceship? The thing at the baseball game that made tons of sound?

For creatures that ""hunt"" or whatever they do based on sound, they're not very good at picking up on it most of the time.

Why are they hanging out in the woods always within like a 30 second dash from people? Are there no locations with more than like 2 people around?

Do they themselves not make any sound? You never hear them unless they're coming to attack.",nmnxqu
h5zsuq6,"Assuming they can’t swim, I assume it’s just North America that would be desolate. Unless meteors hit all over earth. 

Maybe some could make it to South America if very lucky.",nmnxqu
h6ggj7m,I was thinking this as well.  The USS Nimitz had a 321 day deployment due to COVID.  There are submarines that can go 25 years without refueling.  Once a vessel is alerted to an emergency they would stay out at sea and would still exist.  Maybe this is what remains of the military which we get to see in the third film.,nmnxqu
h712d0o,"I thought the first movie showed they could swim though. Like we saw the one go under water, I know it was shallow but it was still searching underwater.",nmnxqu
h7a8341,"That was my question; were there entirely untouched continents? Or, did clusters of them land everywhere, and the only safe havens were small random islands?",nmnxqu
h7qylad,So I’m late to the party but I hope people see this cause I just saw the movie. THAT was my initial thought process as well but here is my theory. I don’t think they those creatures are intelligent and capable of arriving on the planet.  Maybe there is intelligent life that uses them as killer pets to completely destroy a planet before the real Aliens come to take the resources. It’s hard to wrap your minds around it but what if there are somehow even millions of these creatures that are sent in these meteors EVERYWHERE. Their way of killing people isn’t exactly  quick and efficient if you think about how many people are in the world. So the only safe places are pretty much desolate small islands. Think about it. Everywhere the humans are if they make a noise those creatures pretty much show up instantaneously. There probably was a meteor full of them that hit all the larger populated islands as well.,nmnxqu
h8prvi7,Not to mention that there would have to literally be hundreds of trillions of the stupid things to always be so omnipresent across the globe.,nmnxqu
h8tshbg,"There's literally sonic cannons used from bunkers, realistically some military branch would have gotten information that they attack sound and would try to amp frequencies up, which could likely explode their heads altogether.

Besides that, how does their armor protect against direct impacts from strong vehicles? Also if they can't swim is New Zealand or Australia unscathed?",nmnxqu

And then of course their panic and scramble to survive when the reality of what was happening set in.

h0b1xho,"> I loved the first sequence because I had wanted to see how everything started, and I also appreciate how significant those moments were for the rest of the film.

I kinda felt like, while it was the most exciting part, it really wasn't that significant. It felt John Krasinski just wanted to be in it for a little and this was the only way. Other than that, it just shows Cillian Murphy and the whole ""dive"" thing. What else did it set up?",nmnxqu

h2dwpja,They telegraphed it pretty hard lol — I’ve never heard someone tell someone to dive into home plate in a baseball game but whatever lol it worked well enough,nmnxqu
h53zvk7,"My mind went from ""oh no, he's begging for her life"" to ""oh fuck, he has a plan"" and it was really fun.",nmnxqu
h1gi03w,"i realized it was gonna happen after they showed him returning in the present. i just thought ""dive is such a specific word to have specially shown us how to sign earlier. hes def signing it to her later"" lol",nmnxqu
h1lwis1,I read this comment immediately after responding to someone who said that part was unnecessary to set up because most people could guess what the sign for “dive” would be. Some peeps just don’t understand good storytelling and callbacks I guess.,nmnxqu
h43po0c,"Yes. Ah man, I loved that.",nmnxqu
h6wwmwh,"I really wanted Marcus to hit the baseball hard, then track the ball and see the meteor … then later, when Marcus grew courage, it was him slamming the monster with a baseball bat like object instead of Regan … seemed like a really easy way to explain where he got both the courage and competence to kill the animal whereas him walking out with a gun felt odd to me. Him going ape ship on a monster, unleashing his rage, with a baseball bat, made a ton of sense to me.",nmnxqu
h8kzfkz,"You could see it from miles away though, I kid you not when I say that when Emmet said 'I found a boat' I immediately thought of him being taught the signal.",nmnxqu
gzq3jqm,[deleted],nmnxqu
gzxy0wi,I thought that guy was Rickety Cricket at first.,nmnxqu
h0cz1ib,"There were definitely very rapey vibes coming from that group. They cleverly stopped Cillian with the sound apparatus so that they could escape with their target, the girl.",nmnxqu
gzq2b1d,Hmm. Didn’t even catch it. I wonder if there was something cut or if it will lead to something in Part III.,nmnxqu
h04ryju,"I think he was kinda miscast, they should have went with Armie Hammer.",nmnxqu
gzt1xaf,"I feel like he's one of those actors that's just down for anything if the movie is going to be good, even if his profile is getting higher and the role is small.",nmnxqu
h04grvw,"I just figured it was to show how bad the people left were cuz, think about it. The people left are either super smart, or straight up savages. Cillian’s character Emett was telling Emily Blunt’s character there wasn’t food or water for them right away. That group of people probably survived by taking from others and being cut throat. I think it’s really just tribalism and how society has regressed, no social contract to give people a sense of unity.",nmnxqu
h0n15sk,"How did that boat/cannibal colony not know about the island, or that the monsters can’t swim. Also I didn’t think the monsters would be near that area since crashing waves, boats slapping against docks would piss them off to be more in the mountains.",nmnxqu
h00pvur,I was pretty confused about that scene tbh.,nmnxqu
gzr5b20,I totally didn’t believe you but I just looked up the cast on IMDB. It says Andy Richter was also in the movie.,nmnxqu
h04wlyg,They did say “other people are not the same out here” or some such,nmnxqu
gzwwqhz,Agreed. It felt weird. He’s not really big enough for a cameo but that’s essentially what it was.,nmnxqu
h5lshy1,"Why didn't those morons go to the island? They had boats. They could see the island. Okay, they probably didn't hear/solve the broadcast...but surely hiding on an island should have been considered before becoming a freaky rapist colony that quietly traps people on the docks using children as bait.",nmnxqu
h08yjxg,"That scene was so out of place, had no context, and was never fleshed out.",nmnxqu
h02okpb,"I thought Cillian said in the airlock when he meets with the Abbots: ""You don't know what it does to them"" (talking about his wife) and I thought he meant those people. I might just be incredibly confused",nmnxqu
gzxutuf,I thought he was Guy Pearce for a sec. My wife thought he looked like Rickety Cricket.,nmnxqu
h0bam8g,I feel like the entire last act was a rewrite,nmnxqu
h5kt511,I didn't even know thay was Scoot McNairy until I saw the credits. Dude deserved a lot more acting chops,nmnxqu
gzxe286,I want to say this had more of an explanation before they ultimately planned this as a trilogy. Maybe they are saving it for a sequel?,nmnxqu
h04x670,Wow did not recognize him at all.,nmnxqu
h59ztv0,"He had a one second part in Once Upon a time in Hollywood too (though, this is more QT's style casting actors in bit roles). Like, he isn't a huge actor but he is certainly beyond nameless roles lol.",nmnxqu
h54x1kv,Did ya miss the part where there’s monsters that hear you really good lol,nmnxqu
h00k5ns,Yeah we’re they cannibals?,nmnxqu
gzw0jjq,"I don’t think that the aliens drown, they just can’t swim. If they don’t have lungs, and their skin can survive a meteor impact, then they probably can’t float. Plus, they’re gangly and not really swimmer types.",nmnxqu
gzpr750,My favorite had to be when Cillian saw the boat show up. You knew some bad shit was about to go down,nmnxqu
h5j3k5u,"every single characters expression of fear was spot on throughout the movie. You feel like youre with them in the car, with them while theyre running, holding your breath with them. Krasinski did a really great job of pulling the audience in through outstanding character story teling.",nmnxqu
gzsycei,"Unless you’re completely unfamiliar with the game, it was impossible NOT to see The Last of Us when it was just Cillian and Millicen XD",nmnxqu
gzq5v9l,He was great in Sunshine too.,nmnxqu
gzu2cak,"I knew I couldn't be the only one to get TLOU vibes from this.  There's the bit with the island you mentioned and a familiar shot of their boat on the beach, the goal of getting to said beach to find a group of survivors due to a radio call, Cillian and Millicent felt reminiscent of Joel and Ellie from their appearance down to their weapons and gear, the opening sequence with a POV shot inside a vehicle driving through apocalyptic chaos...even the sounds the creatures made during the more suspenseful moments was reminiscent.  


Some if not all of this may just be due to shared genre tropes, but still the amount of similarities is interesting.  I'm curious if anyone involved in the production is a fan.",nmnxqu
gzqha57,red eye,nmnxqu
gzucwow,"Dude that shot of the boat on the beach of the island is very similar to the menu from The Last of Us 2, after you beat the game.",nmnxqu
gzybza9,It reminded me of Last of Us especially because of the duo that includes a “Dad that lost his own kids” father figure and the badass girl with a unique trait that helps her to survive her dystopia.,nmnxqu
gzwpa4m,"Dude I thought to myself during the beginning, Jim took a break from CoD to play last of us.",nmnxqu
gzue9ju,I wanted a full movie with him as the main villain Scarecrow. His performance was really what sold me on Nolans Batman,nmnxqu
gzxvj1k,Yeah right when they brought up the island I thought about the seraphites then they take off in the boat and I was like damn this feels very Last of Us,nmnxqu
h0zlv4v,Walked out of the theater saying how much I _expect_ TLOU series to have that feel. This felt like a primer on how to do it.,nmnxqu
gzwt37c,He’s an amazing actor - I’ve seen him live on stage twice and he is just excellent.,nmnxqu
h05kdw8,That boat at the beach reminded me of TLOU 2's loading screen so much,nmnxqu
h04zww4,Cillian could’ve been a great Joel or Tommy imo,nmnxqu
h1dgb9l,I love the last of us. About to start the second one!,nmnxqu
h06is1e,Can we just take a moment to appreciate Cillian Murphy's beard?,nmnxqu
h1pmhfr,"This movie kinda is just The Last of Us , slightly changed",nmnxqu
h1hhcex,"I got TLoU vibes throughout the entire thing. The contrast of human desperation, the collapse of society, and the beauty of nature reclaiming the world was perfect.",nmnxqu
gzricto,You should watch Peacock.,nmnxqu
h0hs55d,"Major last of us vibes especially with all the boats. Had it completely with part 1 as well - Tlou series will have a hard job to make us that paranoid about making noise.

The scene with the boats and cillian murphy with the ""hunters"" was *chefs kiss*",nmnxqu
h2g0l1b,"At one point during the film, my gf mentioned how much the monsters reminded her of clickers because of the noises they make. I was surprised I hadn’t noticed sooner",nmnxqu
h2vfws5,You’ve gotta see Red Eye! It’s a thriller with Cillian and Rachel McAdams. It’s a really fun watch!,nmnxqu
h3doxax,"Like anya taylor joy. They're attractive people, but unconventional ways, and there's something about their face that can easily be interpreted as *off*. Murphy is really gaunt, joy has those far apart eyes.",nmnxqu
h3sh762,The chaos town scene reminds me of TLOU1's town scene where there was chaos everywhere. Only change in the time of the day and the monsters involved.,nmnxqu
h0b2625,"Not a horror movie, but have you seen Free Fire? Such a fun and awesome movie, and I think it's my favorite from him.",nmnxqu
h1jzdo0,"Check out ""Red Eye"" too! He's fantastic in that.",nmnxqu
h2i62m4,OMG yes!! When the boat pulled to the island...exactly what I thought of,nmnxqu
h4fgdc9,Watch Sunshine with him.,nmnxqu
h5co25j,Just watched the movie now that it is on prime video. The scene with Cillian and Millicen on the bridge when they were looking far away at the island and the boats gave me The Last Of Us vibes because I remember there being a bridge scene just like that as well!,nmnxqu
gzvyaht,this movie was a better sequel to last of us than last of us 2 was.,nmnxqu
h79wmth,"Also the creatures looked like clickers kind of  from the last of us, when they use sound and there head opens up. Or is it just me?",nmnxqu
h8xkd4x,Check out Red Eye. One of Wes Craven’s later films. Very suspenseful and Cillian’s scary af in it,nmnxqu
h07kfp9,"They may not have revealed their names in Part I, but they definitely weren’t nameless, right? Like, John Krasinski was credited as Lee Abbott, Jupe as Marcus Abbott, etc.",nmnxqu
h5kta8v,"Kinda like in The Last of Us II where ""character"" namedrops Joel's last name, a name not even the player knew",nmnxqu
h05tsmc,I swear I saw a few Jurassic Park scenes in there as well,nmnxqu
h0q5yed,Yep I immediately thought Aliens when the alien had hitched a ride to where we thought was the safe place.,nmnxqu
h0q4bvk,">J

And Jaws, with shooting the oxygen tank.  Definitely an homage there.",nmnxqu
gzu6jkd,Unsung? That mf was loud as shit and has the most kill assists in the franchise.,nmnxqu
h061b5x,That's a cochlear ear implant hearing device. There not particularly common.,nmnxqu
gzzlgaw,I think only that specific one works since the dad moded it,nmnxqu
h00m2h8,Uh Emmet had it omg I was freaking out,nmnxqu
h0457eh,There's an app for that.,nmnxqu
h7daaqy,Or make a recording of it. That would seem to make common sense.,nmnxqu
i54r87b,Isn't it just feedback? Isn't that why the plan made sense- broadcast feedback so others will eventually figure out it is the creatures kryptonite? Have I got the entire thing wrong?,nmnxqu
gzudyz1,right all I kept thinking was press the pause button I gotta use the bathroom,nmnxqu
h01rb5i,I severely missed subtitles.,nmnxqu
h00mz9o,Oh god yes what the hell that drove me crazy,nmnxqu
h01s67h,I was so pissed they didn’t have captions,nmnxqu
h1h2rqf,I actually looked for my remote at one point to turn up the volume.,nmnxqu
h3umcqj,"One of the advantages of living in a place where Spanish is the main language is that all movies in theater have captions. Granted, it’s a little annoying because the captions are in Spanish and I prefer them in English, but they still help. The idea of going to a movie and not having captions of any kind is foreign to me.",nmnxqu
h50w7ap,Same! When the the mom and Emmett were first talking I couldn’t understand anything they were saying. I was like I hope the whole movie isn’t like this,nmnxqu
h2cc9sb,Yes same here I thought something was wrong with the movie for half a second when the subs didn’t come up,nmnxqu
h9kdcr0,My theatre has these closed caption things they give you.,nmnxqu
gzwp9of,Part 4 Reagan attaches a large speaker to her missing leg to use it as a weapon.,nmnxqu
h1fgs06,shes gonna step on a lego. worse than the other 2 combined,nmnxqu
h3zx123,"There were so many leg injuries in this movie. The bear trap, Evelyn's leg getting clawed, Emmett's legs getting slashed...I think I missed some even but damn, this was not a good movie to the lower extremities.",nmnxqu
h4187wx,Hopefully just Reagan just dies instead.,nmnxqu
h22ta2e,I love this comment. So many well thought-out reactions to the movie. But this one is on my level,nmnxqu
h2mbvi5,"I just wish it was a liiiiittle more gorey. I didn’t want a full on bloodbath, but these thing were WRECKING SHIT and the most blood I saw was from the bear trap.",nmnxqu
h3r6egi,I couldn't help but wonder why though. Like what's their motive? Do they just not like anything that makes noise? If that's the case wouldn't they smash the human till it stopped making sounds or something. It certainly wasn't for food.,nmnxqu
gzpz9lx,"I loved how they demonstrated that when the mother signed to her son to just breathe while at the plate. It makes complete sense that they'd take advantage of knowing signing in their every day lives to communicate like this without drawing attention. 

Also, the long shot of Emily Blunt driving the car down the street with the chaos coming down on them was excellent.",nmnxqu
gzt0yr7,"I liked how Cillian Murphy's character didn't and twice the girl had to help him communicate with her. First telling him to enunciate and then later on getting him to look at her while talking so it's easier for her to read his lips.

Knew that him learning ""dive"" in the flashback bit would come back later on too.",nmnxqu
gzrokst,"Indeed. What is interesting to note and I find it powerful how the Abbott family mostly uses ASL as their form of communication and survival, you don't see that in a Hollywood film so often but it speaks volume.",nmnxqu
gztdx5u,"Exactly, with this advantage they managed to survive longer than the rest of the people. It’s quite a nice detail Krasinski added to the movie.",nmnxqu
gzuiplj,Also what happened in the prologue? Aliens attacked a plane?,nmnxqu
h54wfpy,I don't mean to be rude but I'm amazed some folks didn't pick this up within the first few minute of the first film. It's a huge plot point.,nmnxqu
h0irx2c,Same thoughts and I was also wondering how long it would take me to learn,nmnxqu
h5oazh6,"And advantage as a family unit perhaps but the worst possible scenario for the deaf girl if she would be alone. She does spend some time alone in the movie (like when she is running away) and in reality she would be a goner in no time. Making a sound means potential death and not being able to hear if you’re making a sound or not, you’re screwed.",nmnxqu
gzq8mho,[removed],nmnxqu
gzq0vp0,literally every family w atleast one deaf person knows how to sign,nmnxqu
h0a7gq1,LITERALLY his anxiety gets the best of him,nmnxqu
h01kgyd,Lmaoo,nmnxqu
gzptuzy,"That's what my son and I were saying on the way home:

Part one: How do we hurt one

Part two: How do we hurt a bunch of them all at once

Part three: How do we get rid of them for good

...Part four: We take the fight to their planet! (please don't do this)",nmnxqu
gzt9cdp,"That has the appearance of a cochlear implant, which doesn’t make sense because cochlear implants don’t make any outside noise unless you have the internal part of the implant. I guess the cochlear implant looks cool so they used that.",nmnxqu
gzuxgm9,It made me wonder how long the battery life is for hearing aids (if they are battery operated). Also Lee spent a lot of time making hearing aids for her to get to that one we see in this movie. Does that mean only that particular hearing aid is capable of that frequency?,nmnxqu
gzvth0o,"I love the idea for how they're fighting back, but it was/is one of the harder disbeliefs to suspend that no one else figured it out before them.  
We have an entire planet of scientists/people dedicated to and well-versed in knowing about sound/hearing, who once they realized the monsters had an extremely sensitive hearing, would have undoubtedly thought of the ""high-pitched noise to hurt/disorient them the way a dog whistle irritates a dog"" tactic and surely would've been one of the first trials in fighting back by a military force; we even already have multiple types of sonic/high-frequency-based offensive weapons/tools.

I've even thought about that specifically a couple of times; what would a dog whistle or similar do to these things? Or the screeching feedback noise when you put a microphone up to a speaker, which is basically the same thing that's happening with her earpiece.",nmnxqu
gzwrdha,I hope they are able to find a stash of hearing aid batteries...,nmnxqu
h044s7c,They should use whatever song they used in Mars Attacks! to wipe out the aliens.,nmnxqu
h2xr08t,Who knew walking around with a  boombox on your shoulder blasting “eeeeeeeee” and a sawedoff shotgun in the other hand would make you a savior of the people. Lol. I do hope there are roaving bands of hunters using cars with good sound systems driving around with the windows down and taking out those aliens in the sequel.,nmnxqu
h5xktgt,"I see everybody calling it a hearing aid, and then realize it's only obvious to ME that it's a cochlear implant because I took two years of ASL in high school. I'd never even HEARD of one until then. Still rarely have.

A plain old hearing aid won't do shit for a fully deaf person. You can't amplify zero. A cochlear implant goes directly into part of the ear (listen to me being vague, it's the cochlea), giving hearing, or some approximation of it, to somebody who doesn't have any naturally.",nmnxqu
gzwtohx,They mentioned something about hearing the hurricane sirens and that was when they knew to evacuate so maybe they get to wherever that sound comes from to increase the hearing aid frequency worldwide?,nmnxqu
h01yk1o,The hearing aid the MVP,nmnxqu
h04ps08,Starship Troopers?,nmnxqu
h05itsd,The only that pulled out of the story a bit was when he puts the thing in his mouth to save it after being half drowned like wouldn't it have fired by then?,nmnxqu
h3jm16m,"4, It's killed 4.",nmnxqu
gzqk36q,"Seriously, looking back it was good acting on his part. However, while watching the movie, I felt the same emotions as his mother, “Please, shut up. Please for the love of god”",nmnxqu
gzqipmj,"That’s a good observation, stuck out to me how real his screams were in a way I wouldn’t expect with this kind of movie",nmnxqu
gzvizr2,"Even in the first, though, Emily Blunt finally gave in to crying out when she was in labor in the bath tub. Loved that",nmnxqu
h06jkv3,"Even Emily started screaming a half second before the fireworks went off.  For all she knew, there weren't going to BE any fireworks covering her screams. So good.",nmnxqu
gztuhsg,"I liked that too, but that clashed with how aware the townsfolk seemed at the outbreak, I mean it’s kind of natural to be quite when there are monsters about but I would expect more pandemonium and unawareness of the monsters sound focused hunting. But I did love the two kids in the closet at the end, how the new generation only survives if they know how to shut up.",nmnxqu
h01kpxa,Right he’s a amazing actor that scream gave me chills and I also did love how this character was screaming even tho it would get him killed  because in reality we would all scream in that situation I felt so bad for him but amazing actor,nmnxqu
h01c16b,"I sort of disagree. An initial scream, sure! But to continue screaming is sort of a choice isn't it? Maybe I'm totally wrong?",nmnxqu
h1s8h7l,"I noticed this and love this detail! Was so glad he didn't just shut up once his mom covered his mouth, since it's what usually happens. It gave it a more realistic factor.",nmnxqu
h5j44tc,"I think they portray him as a kid very well. He also leaves the bunker after his mother tells him not to because, well, he's a kid! And that's what kids do.",nmnxqu
h5z152p,"Right? I thought that was one of the most realistic depictions. When bone is damaged, it hurts like nothing else, and you can't do anything but scream because thats the only way to make the pain subside just a little bit.",nmnxqu
h6lnoq8,"Well not long after that he was hobbling around, climbing up ladders, completely took the realism outta it.
He should have been on his back for days while it healed looking at the wound",nmnxqu
h75xfqp,"That scream was so visceral, too. Not just “ahhhhhh”. We all hurt ourselves bad as kids and had that uncontrollable pitchy freakout scream and that was completely perfect",nmnxqu
h7989li,"As a parent, it really tugged on my heartstrings seeing Emily Blunt’s character desperately trying to hush her son who was probably in the most pain of his life.

Any parent would want to console and comfort their child in pain, but she was forced to do anything to just shut him up. Really incredible acting from both Blunt and Jupe",nmnxqu
h0181a5,See I kind of thought that was a pretty unrealistic reaction. I think people would make a noise but screaming like that didn’t seem really accurate,nmnxqu
h04qwjd,I thought the exact same thing!,nmnxqu
gzzfv87,Lol that was so badass I got chills,nmnxqu
h245jxd,It gave me some big Peaky vibes,nmnxqu
h63kl5c,It was even better when it was revealed he kept the hearing device safe out of the water by putting in his mouth.,nmnxqu
gzrwnqm,Bro that episode of lost where it's just people living in a normal town and they all go outside and see the plane crashing blew my mind. Same with the season two opener with Desmond's morning routine. I really loved Lost in spite of all it's flaws.,nmnxqu
gzs9hh3,"Honestly, them just chilling around the campfire was the most disconcerting part to me.",nmnxqu
gzu2jm1,Yes!! I thought the exact same thing. Major Lost vibes.,nmnxqu
h0107d7,"That’s exactly what I thought. It was just like Locke, Kate, and Sayid arriving at New Otherton.",nmnxqu
h2ibffx,Absolutely. For a moment I wondered if they filmed at the same location.,nmnxqu
gzrmqaq,"i had this same feeling when the first trailers came out last year, it does look very similar",nmnxqu
h3qs1m3,"Sort of brought me out of the movie.  When they come up on the houses and the beach cookout I was just like, 'Where the fuck are these people getting electricity!?  How do they have food!?  It's been a whole goddamn year+ and they're on an ISLAND!'",nmnxqu
h1kmk6o,"Oh yeah! Thank you for this, this is why it looked so familiar. Wonder if Juliette was there!",nmnxqu
h5pskqn,in another life brotha,nmnxqu
h3n2j8p,"I was gonna comment the same thing!! Major LOST vibes from the village on the island, and also with the bad people on the dock",nmnxqu
h535ugc,"i was thinking that too, surely these people aren't good",nmnxqu
h3dxdkg,For sure that was one of the first things I said to my wife. Especially with how many shots they had of the characters feet moving on a path.,nmnxqu
h5ptjbf,"Reminded me of Walking Dead and of course, they had to bring the threat and ruin their peaceful vibe lol",nmnxqu
gzuqubl,"While I agree with this, I think the typical viewer is way more critical of the moments presented in films because you are a bystander without actual real attachment to the situation. Like I know myself and I know if I was in a situation with an actual murderer I don’t know what the fuck I would do tbh. That instant reaction shows what kind of person you are, not everyone is going to just sprint away from the monster. Fight or flight exists because not everyone living thing reacts the same.",nmnxqu
gzyamyj,"i noticed that too. this reaction adds to the list of actions we see him take in order to survive. basically acting like an animal would. most animals run from something they don’t understand. they hide and they keep quiet. whether it was some kind of instinct or lee is just incredibly quick on the uptake, he’s definitely a survivor.

what i thought was really interesting is when lee and his daughter see the mom’s car get hit by that bus, and the girl runs to try and help, he grabs her and runs the opposite direction. trying to figure out if he was just cold trying to survive at all costs or if he thought his wife could survive if it came to it.",nmnxqu
h08h5br,He vaults over something in a very satisfying manner.,nmnxqu
h1nulbq,"This is probably my favorite part. Its was a moment in the theatre where I was just so surprised. If I remember correctly, Krasinskis character isnt shown actually seeing or looking at the creature at all. It was like he knew something fucked up happened and didn't need to verify. He seemed to gather information about his surroundings really quick. So he already knew something dangerous was going on. Then that alien crashed and he just knew to run without needing to see what it was.",nmnxqu
h5j4h8k,his expression is just classic noping the fuck out,nmnxqu
h5d5xt4,Yes yes the the classic “stumble backwards whilst gazing at the carnage in front of you for 5 seconds then hastily and stumblingly getting up and run away.” Trope,nmnxqu
h49suo1,The contrast of this though was they all saw a meteor in the sky and everyone calmly left. People would be freaking tf out.,nmnxqu
gzww37o,I disagree. It took me out. Almost nobody in the world would see an alien take out some dude 10 feet in front of him and not freeze up,nmnxqu
gzqzu7j,I couldn’t really see what the headline on the tv was in the beginning. Was it mentioning that the meteors landed in China or something?,nmnxqu
gzpqup9,It is kind of eerie when you think about it. I was in the city when the pandemic began and it more or less looked just like that. People staring at screens wondering what the fuck is happening,nmnxqu
gzq7clo,"Then about a year and a half later, his wife runs into a family friend and doesn't even realize who it is because a mask is covering half their face.",nmnxqu
gztcc7a,Even funnier fact is that theaters were all shut down one week before this was supposed to hit theaters. Can you imagine the timing if this was in theaters a few weeks and then everything shut down?,nmnxqu
gzpzdcn,"Watching them all react to the meteor hit home too. Like it was immediately all out panic, but it just escalated from there.",nmnxqu
gzt26ry,"The scene where Cillian Murphy sees all the people living normal lives on the island reminded me so much of how I've felt seeing things go back to normal (e.g. kids playing baseball without masks, people gathering with friends, BBQs).",nmnxqu
gzqz97u,I thought I saw Singapore,nmnxqu
h055i1e,"For real man, it was so eerie. I know it's cliche to compare the movie to COVID, but it really felt like pre covid vs right in the middle of the pandemic. Especially as the film was supposed to release in march 2020.",nmnxqu
h0r6qwf,"His son died in 2020 in the first film, too.",nmnxqu
h0y5l4a,I wasn't expecting to but I got super emotional during that opening scene. Seeing everyone in a community together at a standard weekend morning little league game and then out of nowhere a mysterious thing arrives to turn everything upside down. Really hit me hard.,nmnxqu
h0wci1x,"Loved the movie but this didn't make sense to me. In NY the monsters were slaughtering people minutes after the meteor landed, why would news be covering a meteor in Shanghai with no indication of what was going on?",nmnxqu
h2247gi,That rocked me.,nmnxqu
h3n1rh4,Made for incredible cinema.,nmnxqu
gzrhmtl,"I watched the movie back in February 2020 at paramount studios for an audience test screening, I’ve had to sit on not talking about it this long, and my main gripe with the movie was how abruptly it ended. I guess it worked very well since it left me wanting more.",nmnxqu
gzprk2q,Movie is a trilogy. So this is kind of a “gap” credits scene. There was no real way to reach a conclusion for the second film. John seems to have a pretty clear vision of where he wants this to go,nmnxqu

First one ended the same way. I loved it. Looking forward to part 3",nmnxqu

Can you really blame him, though?  He's still a really young kid who was frightened just a day or two ago, lost his dead, was abandoned by his sister, mom, and other possible protector and left all alone for what could be the rest of his life.  Him wanting to see if he could spot his mom and being nervous for what was going on made sense.  All this shit happening within a few days is a LOT.",nmnxqu

gzpshio,"I mean he's literally the only other character until the last act of the movie. He either was or he wasn't, but I liked the way they went with him. Having to realize your family died because you didn't have faith enough in humanity to try. Must have been crushing.",nmnxqu

gzr7y6q,yep great scene and very well-acted by the kid; the only problem I had with it is that there ain't NO WAY that beartrap didn't absolutely shatter his bones and yet mom said it was just  a soft-tissue injury.,nmnxqu

h4tn2pm,"Wow it took me forever to find a comment like this. I agree. My brother put it best: ""This movie did not have to be made."" Nothing did happen. First movie was PROBLEM > WE SAVED but the movie idea is so fresh that it's rewarding. This was exactly the same with all the same ideas... I try to be quiet but uh oh I make sound and now action music but then I'm safe... like it feels like it went in a circle instead of a line",nmnxqu

The girl decides to go to an island to tell people how to fight the monsters. You know, the thing they already did at the end of the first film. Monsters attack, and the characters run away or beat them.  The end. 

I would have preferred if the prequel from the beginning just carried on, as that was the only interesting bits of the movie. I'm not sure what the hell everyone has raving on and on about in all these comments, because this shit was beyond generic and formulaic. At least generic and formulaic movies have stakes.",nmnxqu

The ending had some Stranger Things vibe going on.",nmnxqu
gztjxwa,"My issue with the savage people was that they should have had an even better plan for subduing their targets.

*Maybe* they were expecting the bond between the girl and Cilian to keep him quiet, but in other circumstances im sure a lot of people would go: ""Oh, you're gonna take me away to eat/rape/whatever me?  Alright, guess I'm gonna Tarzan yell and take my chances, fuck y'all.""

Wayyy too much of a liability where your victim basically has a 'nuke all of us' button that could be used at any time, even a yell, or a minor struggle.

Maybe some kind of soundproof trap, or ambush once they're out on the water. Not: ""here's some cowbells, I know you're desperate and might not be thinking clearly while full of adrenaline, please don't make much noise!""",nmnxqu
gzpwv0l,Yeah the scene with the savage people almost seemed like it switched to becoming a zombie movie. Wish they kinda gave more insight as to why they're the way they are I guess?,nmnxqu
gzsrxzf,"My guess is that food becomes very scarce, and some pockets of people become cannibals.  I'm guessing that's why they were trying to take Regan.  I'm hoping that the third movie will explore this aspect further, but we'll have to wait and see.",nmnxqu
h00fzcg,To me they stemmed like a cult. Maybe they shackled Emmit as a sort of sacrifice to the creatures. The fact that a large group of them doesn’t carry guns means that they only care to take out humans.,nmnxqu

I would warn going to a packed movie theater because I did and fucking assholes everywhere were talking and on their phone. I’m going to see it again later today to the earliest showing possible to avoid a large crowd. You must see it with as little sound in the audience as possible, but on the biggest screen possible.",nmnxqu
h0av3hu,"They aren’t even plot holes, just people who need things spelled out for them in dialogue despite a tenet of good film making being ‘show, don’t tell’.",nmnxqu
h2iqbnn,"Why would you compare movies, an art form with clear cut narrative structure and plot, to other media forms and ask them to limit their criticisms?

What many are complaining about is sloppy writing and internal consistency issues. Those are huge for enjoying a movie and often especially for horror movies, which have their own lineage of criticizing various character actions. 

In fact, in horror movies, the audience's immersion is often closely tied with the believability and relatability of character motivations and actions. To simply say ""don't beef about this"" is weird on a movie forum. It's not like anyone of these critics is saying that this movie couldn't have been made or shouldn't exist. It is what it is as it's so far a very well crafted, expertly shot, gloriously tense, exquisitely scored, well acted, poorly written and internally inconsistent, sloppy horror flick.",nmnxqu
h419zg7,"Thing is tho it's not a great movie if it's inconsistencies and unexplained plot points are so glaringly obvious. Why did Jupe leave the area? Why did the islanders play ""Beyond the Sea"" other than some cryptic message?, and why were the people at the dock played up to be these savages that have lost all their morality when really they were just creepy old looking bums? The movie is ok like it's mostly as 6 or 7 out of 10 for most people. But don't act like criticisms means a a movie straight up sucks.",nmnxqu

The shot of the one crawling out of the bus windshield was amazing.",nmnxqu

gzpyune,The iconic white board.,nmnxqu
gzxz0eo,"I agree wholeheartedly, really the only big issue I have with this film is that it didn't really get me deeply emotional, except for the car scene on the island, for some reason. Fleshing out Abbott's story and getting me invested in how his characters changes and develops would have helped a lot. The kids certainly changed too within this one film, but I think it would have been more significant if I had just watched the first part then watched the second part immediately after, so the emotions and investment is continuous",nmnxqu
gztb1wp,"I think that would be the way in for the beginning of the third one, then cut back to the aftermath of the radio station for a badass few seconds and then title card.  Just like this one lmao.",nmnxqu
gzq6ckt,White board?,nmnxqu
h3n2s8j,"Agreed. I think a great trilogy would’ve been the first one about the Abbott’s, the second about Emmett’s family at the same time, then the final film being the remaining members of each family coming together and eventually finding safety",nmnxqu

gzqeg34,"I dunno how much more of their origin I really need, seems they just lived on a rock floating through space, probably spent most of their evolutionary history without a star to provide them light, hence their keen sense of sound.

gztwh98,"The series seems to rely on a time travel movie “don’t think about it too much” sort of tone.

Especially with the no swimming realization: there would be so many surviving groups on islands, and probably a lot with military logistics. I think there would be a lot more radio traffic and messages of hope on the airwaves.

Also why does the survivor island make their savior message a puzzle? Why not just say: hey were living here? Do murderous survivors not have the ability to figure that out as well?

Well, there I go thinking about it too much.",nmnxqu

gzpu0t0,"I took it as it being a small town, he knew the guy and he knew him. It was understood he would come back and pay when the baseball game was over.

gzw5k0d,Small town. I think he basically said I’m in a rush and to put it on my tab. The whole beginning of the movie pretty much showed how close the town was which makes Emmet not helping in the 1st movie more impactful.,nmnxqu

h5dapn0,"Along with what other people are saying, he’s a cop right? At least I’m pretty sure that’s what was implied- so maybe it’s a ‘thanks for serving the community’ kind of thing. Or again, it’s a tan and they know he’s good to pay them back especially since he’s a cop.",nmnxqu
gzqkn5p,"Probably to avoid telling everyone and their momma where they’re located. Desperate times calls for crazy people, and the dock scene proved that. I guess it was a “if you went as far as to figure out the code, you must be in desperate need.”",nmnxqu

Also if the people at the dock live in those boats surely they’ve seen a creature fall in the water before so why do they keep them moored?",nmnxqu
gzst2fp,"I thought the same, I think the movie tries to justify it by having the island leader character telling the story of the coast guard (?) lining 12 boats up and getting 10 of those boats slaughtered, maybe to imply he’s trying to avoid that situation again.

Think back to the story Djimon tells about a mass of people freaking out and getting worked up into a frenzy, leading to a majority of people who could have been saved being killed.

It was probably too risky to record anything new and maybe they didn't have the proper tools to do it, given that it's just a small island radio station.

I see a lot of people missing all the ways they tried to show that he suffers from anxiety. Everyone just thinks his character was cowardly or a scaredy cat and the opposite of his dad. 

They showed how it crippled him from even swinging the bat during his game and how his mother was always doing those breathing exercises with him. 

The point of his character was largely parallel to his deaf sister; to show how someone with a specific disorder reacts to disaster. His was just not so visible, especially if you don't know anxiety. 

It was very clear to me that he went upstairs to scout for his mother because people with anxiety can *not* handle waiting and more so uncertainty.

Overall it gave the impression that the aliens were there for a while and there was a prolonged fight against them/things still kind of functioned for a while.

Reality is that it's probably just a retcon.

In story I guess I can think of two explanations: 1. The aliens landed near their farm, killed a bunch of people, then headed out into the rest of the country and were less dense for a while. Maybe for 3-4 months it was back and forth fighting but eventually the aliens just won.
2. Fighting was going on in the wider world, but no one in the town really believed it or thought it would reach them. Those headlines have been going for a while. The town decides to do a baseball game the same way that people kept partying during lockdown- they didn't really understand the danger and didn't think it would affect them. The aliens landing in 2 are the first ones in the local area.",nmnxqu

The newspaper at the beginning seems to be a mistake in hindsight. I'm sure they included it to explain to the audience what's going on, but by the time they wrote the second movie, they didn't leave enough time for that newspaper to get printed or delivered.

They hadn't experienced any trouble yet so they didn't have any precautions set up in place.

I didn't think that they would be for people, including the bear trap.

h2bskb4,">why would the audio of ""beyond the sea"" be a puzzle?? What do they gain from this? Why not just broadcast their location and how to get there?? Wouldn't you want to save as many people as possible?

My thought is this was genius. For one, it's an assumption that they had an option to do a clearer voice recording of any kind. It's very possible the record player is all they had, though I do think they could have figured something out if they really wanted to.  
However, If you don't make it a puzzle, you are telling literally everyone where you are at. You saw how shitty and evil a lot of the people have turned. You want those people to come to your paradise? With it being a puzzle you are only going to attract people who have genuine hope there's something better out there, which are the kind of people you want. There's also the factor that every new person coming to the island is a risk of monster infestation on the island, which we also saw happen. It's pretty natural of humans to protect the \~50 people they have and love over risking it all to bring everyone they can on the island.

Completely agree on the boy being a moron, I don't know if I missed something but him exploring made absolutely zero sense to me and is probably my biggest complaint. He needed a clearer motivation for what he did. The boat trap also seemed maybe a little illogical, but I suppose it could have been used to set any time they are away from the boats to protect the territory. Emmett also had a noise trap, though he had a lookout tower with a sniper to make it a little more logical.",nmnxqu
h3iii59,"* The radio system was analogic, not electronic. They were even using some kind of gramophone, for Christ. There was no such thing as recording an mp3 or something and uploading it into a PC in replay mode.
* Plot. The mom just gave birth, the childs carried the film giving amazing performances.
* Because it would be really prudent (/s) to burden yourself with the weight of the whole stock of a pharmacy, at the risk of making even more sound. You would just take what you needed and leave.
* If you think about it, it's the only easy to do trap you could make without the victim yelling in pain (like, say, the bear trap). It's not perfect though. 
* He is a boy. Also, ever since Emmet's character is introduced in the plot he is framed as a possible villain: Finger on the trigger, bear and sound traps for humans, ""People are worse than the monsters"" trope, so maybe he has a hidden secret. Turns out he just didn't have the guts to bury his wife, or saw it rather difficult to do so without alerting the monsters.
* The pain would have been from an infection, not from the mechanical injury. It takes days for an infection to spread.
* Perhaps it also worked on batteries? The whole plot occurs in 2 days.

The monster was further behind the family at the start of the film so might not have ""sensed"" them going down the bunker (but it knew they were somewhere around so it apparently hung around) compared to the scene with Noah's character fleeing whereas the monster was right on his ass.

With the scene regarding John telling the people in the diner to be quiet, in just about any monster movie/horror movie there's at least one scene where the people are hiding from the monster/killer who is just outside with a character telling them or motioning for them to be quiet.

* It is extremely unclear what this friend owes this family. If it’s Lee’s brother, they spent a weirdly long time never saying that.
* Emmett seems to sketch the two children that may be his (big question mark surrounding Marcus, but it would explain the baseball game arrangement)
* Something seems off about Lee’s attendance of the baseball game. Similarly there is something going on between Emmett and Evelyn. Ignore this one if it’s conjecture and vibes.

My favorite theory that I've read on that is that the aliens were sent here by an advanced alien race as basically ""drone weapons"" to clear out the planet.

I'm not trying to shit on you but you did a very poor job of criticizing this movie and I feel like you'd be better off going into specifics because you dont have much practice I imagine reviewing films.

Both the daughter and Emmet have tremendous character development in this movie. She (and to a lesser extent her brother) demonstrate they can carry on the will of their father and John deliberately has our two adult leads watching the children at the very end kill the monsters solo. This is an example of showing instead of just telling. Additionally, the brother was a pussy constantly in the beginning and in parallel with his sister finally grows a pair with her help at the end. Emmet also literally tells the daughter in the village that while he is nothing like her father, she is. This was primarily her coming of age film.

Also Emmet was a pessimistic who had given up on the world and the idea of saving anyone. He literally was willing to die at the very end to give the daughter a chance of activating the sound. Prior to him meeting her he would never had done that and we are even told/shown this as his wife died of an illness because it's implied he was unwilling to go out and get help. Also he didnt even bother to come help this family in the first film when they lit the fire.

As for ""plot progression"" I'm going to assume you mean in the greater world of the film. Well, they literally have given a larger population of survivors on this island a way to defeat the aliens so....

I hope you see why your generalized complaint was contradicts and factually incorrect. I am sure there are things you didn't like but at your level of review skills I would practice fleshing out your thoughts rather than generalizing until you get the grasp of things.

Emmett makes a point of saying that people that are left are not worth saving. From their appearance we can see that they are not in the right state of mind and are most likely cannibals. 

> Why is Emmett’s dead wife in that room in the factory? 

Emmett already explains that she was sick and he had to bring her here because their house was unsafe because of her pains & screaming. He couldn't bury her. You didn't pay attention. 

> The guy on the island who is smart enough to distract the monsters with the car but dumb enough to just randomly start shouting and get killed.

This one I agree is a bit dumb but in movies like this you have to suspend your disbelief sometimes and it's understandable that he would want to go back and help his family. Also he was inexperienced with the monsters.

> Annoying ass kids who don’t listen and split up.

Again suspend disbelief. If the daughter didn't split up they would have all died & there would be no point to the movie. 

> What was the point of the train scene? Just to have Emmett magically save the day? Served no purpose to develop the plot other than to have cheesy jump scares.

Again if there is no threat why even make a movie? It was to show how challenging surviving would be for her if she was by herself. 

> Who is Emmett? Maybe I missed this, but is he Lee’s brother? A Friend? 

He is a family friend shown at the flashback at the start. 

> Everyone is mumbling and you can’t hear anything. Before someone says, “they can’t speak loudly”, the movie production could still do better at getting the actors to enunciate. It’s funny because the character Regan literally tells Emmett to enunciate in the movie.

Sorry but I don't know how to respond to this besides saying it's a stupid complaint when it's about a movie called A Quiet Place. 

> Emily blunts character tells Emmett to go find her daughter Regan, but then leaves on her own to get her son medication, leaving him alone. Sorry but couldn’t she have been the one to go get regan?

It is clear that she probably was expecting Emmett to return with Reagan a lot earlier but as they kept waiting it became clear that she would have to leave otherwise her son would be in a lot of pain. 

> No matter where anyone is when they make the smallest sound apparently there’s an alien no more than 50ft away at all times.

The movie is set in an universe where alien monsters have overrun the planet. Once again a stupid complaint because if there is no threat & danger there is no point to the movie. 

> Regan knows what switches do what at the radio tower 

If you watched the first movie you would know she already has some experience with radios and besides it's not that hard to do that.

> The boat with the alien from dock just drifts to the island 

Understandable complaint but the island is pretty close to shore and it's not that hard to believe that it might have drifted. There is actually a scene showing it drifting towards the island. 

> The bear trapped kid despite being in tons of pain decides to walk all around the factory.

Characters have to be stupid sometimes in movies. By that point he was alone a long time and wanted to see if his mother is coming. 

> How many times did Emmett hand Regan her hearing aid? Seemed like she never had it even though it was hers.

I don't get the point of this complaint. The first time he takes it as protection when he leaves her alone at the train station. The second time it is taken from her by the cannibals and he gives it back. The third time she gives it to him so he can explain to the island people how it works. 

> The whole end objective of getting the hearing aid to the radio station didn’t really do that much because it still required people to have a radio to effectively use the frequency that the aliens don’t like. 

She wasn't thinking about other people. When she decided to go for the radio her primary objective was to use it as protection for her family. Once she got there & transmitted it she knew the radio she left with her brother would pick it up and they would know what it means and how to use the signal. She literally tells him to wait and listen for it. 

> Regan kills an alien with a pipe at the end. Even though she shot one of these aliens on the train earlier with a shotgun and it lived, her swinging a blunt object at the end killed it...

When she shot the alien it wasn't a clean shot and it slightly hit the armor. When she killed the alien with a pipe it was directly in the exposed head area. 

> PG-13 killing scenes 

PG-13 movie

> Emmett can’t take a loose noose off his neck at the dock 

He was trying to navigate the situation without making a sound at first, by the time it got more complicated the noose got more tight because of the struggle with the cannibal. 

>  When all the characters stay in those factory air chambers for safety from the aliens, their failsafe to prevent being locked in there indefinitely is a towel...

What exactly are they supposed to use in this situation? It's a factory and resources are limited. 

> This is the most flagrant flaw. Why is the song “beyond the sea” playing on the radio to tell people to come to the island. How about you just say “hey the aliens can’t SWIM, come to our island and you’ll be safe”. Instead they do this dumb song riddle. 

Have you thought that maybe they put it as a riddle because they wouldn't want just anyone to get there? Emmett makes a point of saying that only bad people are left alive and the cannibals didn't seem particularly smart. In a world like this it makes sense to put some kind of code. 

> The list goes on probably. Just a poor film overall. Cool intro sequence, and then the plot just falls. I would be very curious to see why people enjoyed this movie.

Your whole issue is not paying attention to the movie at all. You call it a poor movie but most of your complaints are actually addressed in the film. Of course they can't actually talk about most of those things but all of it is implied and shown and for a regular viewer who is actually paying attention it's not that hard to understand.",nmnxqu
h0ij3b5,"I agree, subpar movie.  You have some good points.  I hated how dumb the characters were in general.  I felt the movie was slow moving also.  One weird thing to me is Emmet says “tomorrow you need to leave here” then the next day the daughter runs off on her own (so dumb) and the wife is like “go save my daughter for me” and he goes and does it pretty quickly, and that’s basically the catalyst for the story and plot.  He finds the daughter then he makes a snap decision to go along with her mysterious and potentially dangerous plan without thinking of talking to the mom about it.  There were a lot of head scratchers in this.",nmnxqu
h0rag92,"Fair points, RT says 90% but I’d say it’s closer to like a 65% in my eyes.",nmnxqu
h2is2rb,"I agree with every one of your examples of poor writing. 

To give praise to the film, it's well acted, well designed in sound effects, has great editing (which is actually used as a crutch, doing juxtapositional editing to draw out tension), it has great horror moments, a fun concept, and is atmospheric as hell. 


However, it has horrible writing, terrible internal consistency, and a lot of lore and design problems with narrative. It's a real shame because it has great ideas but horrible ways of tying them together. 

Also the whole movie felt like complete filler with the weakest payoff. Exactly like the first in its climax that it felt derivative of itself. 

I normally never diss on sequels and think they're fine. This felt fine, but like a dlc on the original. Not horrible, but pretty lacking in ambition.",nmnxqu
h0r4ohz,Regan’s shotgun grazed the monster. That’s why it didn’t die. If I shot your arm with a shotgun you wouldn’t die (immediately at least) but if I stabbed you straight through the head where your brain is I’d think it work.,nmnxqu
h0i6gps,"If movies, especially sci-fi/horror, were entirely realistic, we wouldn’t have any good ones. Suspend your disbelief my friend. 

I’ll answer one of your points. We find out that Emmetts wife died as she was sick/injured and the story sort of left us to wonder if he had killed her to make her stop being so loud when in pain or if she died naturally. He clearly wasn’t able to deal with her death and him having her body still there as a way of not being able to let go.

Basically you run a risk with a direct message. We see there are pockets of humanity than are less than desirable to encounter. The island already runs a risk with newcomers. Plus not knowing if these creatures understand language can also be cause for concern. Basically the message gives a chance but also provides safety for those residing in the island.

h7yphyv,">In part 2, it picks up at the very same moment but no swarm of monsters is approaching and it's day light. Wtf?

I re-watched AQP and noticed at the end the look that Evelyn/Blunt gives towards Regan/Millicent as she cocks the gun. It was a look of confidence and determination. My understanding is that it is to be believed that she and Regan allowed the monsters/aliens that were surrounding the farmhouse into the basement, used the frequency to weaken them once in the basement, and once weakened to kill them with the shotgun. They basically figured out a way to defend themselves safely.

The very first shot of AQPII we see Marcus covering his ears in terror immediately followed by Evelyn urging him to come out from hiding, shotgun in hand. I guess this is him trying to block out the noise of the frequency and shotgun of what just happened, though the audience is not shown the dead bodies of the monsters/aliens.

Edit: I also want to add two other things that confirms that Evelyn and Reagan both killed the aliens/monsters thats warned their farmhouse using the shotgun and frequency.

(1) When Marcus was caught in the bear trap, Reagan turned on the speaker with her hearing aide at hand, and with Evelyn ready to shoot the alien/monster, but before she could pull the trigger, Emmett, who was watching in the building and acting as a sniper, killed the alien/monster when it was weakened. Emmett saw the entire thing.

And (2) down in the boiler place/factory, Emmett asks ""How does it work?"" referring to the speaker and hearing aide. Evelyn responds ""I don't know. It just does."" Remember that AQP:II takes place only hours after the end of AQP:I. Reagan has an epiphany in AQP:I that amplifying the frequency of her hearing aide with the speaker is one (of many?) weakness of the alien/monster after quickly glancing her late father's investigation work in the basement. 

So anyone who is wondering what happened to the aliens/monsters that were seen surrounding the farmhouse at the very end on the monitors, and thought they just vanished or that the director/screenwriter forgot about continuity, I believe this explains it.",nmnxqu
h6hpts4,"I took it more of a ""hey be quiet this thing might fucking hear us dude"" Pretty typical behavior when your hiding.",nmnxqu
h6i73e6,"What I found confusing and annoying was that, even though the monsters are so incredibly sensitive to sound,  they have no problem making the loudest sounds possible for no reason at all (e.g. knocking a bunch of empty barrels through the warehouse instead going over/around them). It would arguably also have been a lot eerier if they were completely silent, as:
1. They themselves would hear a lot better, so humans couldn't move at all.
2. The thought of absolute silence as a monster runs towards is easily more terrifying than one that roars loudly.",nmnxqu

gzwn332,hidden message was probably in case any crazy people like the ones at the dock were listening,nmnxqu
h0fw5o8,"To answer your first point, playing the cryptic message instead of blatantly stating where they were was probably so that they didn’t attract any crazies like the scurvy people at the docks. They probably figured that if someone was bright enough to decipher the meaning of the song, they were actively looking for others with the intention of helping get back to some sort of normalcy. That’s how I perceived it anyway.

And about your second point, it was pretty obvious when the two monsters jumped on the boat during the scene at the docks and that it was the same boat that washed up on the island. Not really sure how you missed that",nmnxqu
gzvn6ye,"Dude, *come on*. There is an extended action sequence where we see the monster jump from the dock onto the boat, and then it sees one of the other aliens fall onto the water and drown. This is right before Regan pulls Emmett out of the water. The only way you could have missed this is if you straight up weren’t paying attention to a huge chunk of the movie. 

Also, they’re at the mouth of a river that is opening out into the sea. It’s not a huge suspension of disbelief to assume that the current from the river bar floated it out toward the island, which looks to be less than half a mile away.",nmnxqu
gzuc3i9,"2.) wowwww I am getting seriously concerned with how stupid the people are in this thread or you must have just been on your phone and not paying attention. 

Two monsters attacked the dock, one jumped in the water to go after Cillian Murphy but quickly drowned, the other jumped onto the yellow and blue boat and attacked the cannibals trying to get away, Cillian actually untied this boat before being distracted by the young girl running past him. 

We then see the boat with the alien on it start to drift away but not before it seemed like it might have even realized something happened to its partner.

In the chaos offscreen the daughter must have gotten her own row boat and we see her grab Cillian Murphy and pull her aboard. 

It must have taken hours if not a whole day or two for the boat with the alien on it to eventually drift along all the way to the island (really rotten luck for the Island people, it took a giant fluke for an alien to get to them )

Cillian Murphy's character must have just discovered the (now abandoned) boat just as it made it to shore and the alien spurred into action from all the noise from the Island people. 


What actually is a plot hole though is the Alien would have jumped ship hundreds of feet out, as soon as it was within ear shot of the island people who made no attempt to live in silence , before the ship made landshore if its hearing is as good as its made out to be, it would have jumped out the boat not knowing it is just jumping into 20 feet deep water and drowned.

So technically you are right about it being a plot hole but you were way off with how you got there",nmnxqu
gzu94ju,"Those aren't plot holes you just weren't paying attention.  There was a very clear shot of one of the aliens jumping onto the boat that washed ashore on the island.

They're only indestructible on the outside. The sound makes them open their armor up, it's like hitting someone in the head if they don't have a skull.

>7. Are they gonna drag this out for a 3rd installment? There was no closure at all for pt 2. 

Rumors are it's a triology yes. 

Not sure if you didn't pay attention enough, or if the bear trap scene took you out of it that you loss all suspension of disbelief. This movie doesn't hold up super well upon close examination, but most of your problems can be explained by the simple fact: humans aren't perfect and don't react perfectly under stress. 

Try empathizing with the characters a little more, you'll enjoy movies more in general if you do that.",nmnxqu
h5vuguy,"I haven’t seen this mentioned anywhere, but I was bothered by the fact the deaf girl decided to just leave on a whim with little to no information and only consulted the brother. And her excuse was ‘it’s what my dad would do’ she’s smarter than that to just go out by herself to some unknown location without at least asking for help. It kinda killed my immersion/intensity.

hhurtkn,Exactly. They have set up a premise that everything needs to be dead silent. No one would be using a radio and if they were the moment they hear this noise it’ll just cause them to skip the station. No one is going to listen to it and no one is going to listen and think “well fuck me this noise here is going to make the creatures able to be killed or drive them away”. It works if they are actually in communication with anyone and tell those people that this sound which they will play at certain times for certain amount of time will disorient and make the creatures able to be killed. If you don’t have that to everyone it’s just feedback and pointless.,nmnxqu

hhuqym5,"It is very obvious these movies are being done by someone who this is his first time doing directing of this scale. 

There is a lot of stuff that once you start thinking about it, just the movie completely falls apart. 

I really can’t understand the point of trying to make it seem like having the deaf girl with them is somehow a good thing and helpful. Sure they know sign language which is handy but the actual girl herself is a huge liability. She has no hearing whatsoever. She has no grasp of how much noise she is actually making or how loud something is. Having her leave to go off on her journey alone. I’m sorry but within the first hour she would be dead because she absolutely would have made a loud enough noise at some point that would have caught the creatures attention and then since she is walking on rocks and stuff, would just keep making enough noise that draws them in. 

Also in the last movie they freaked out when one noise happened in the house, and that did actually attract a creature it just killed something else instead thinking that thing was the noise maker. Yet this movie the kid is screaming his lung out, and then a shotgun blast happens and only one other creature comes. When the last movie showed droves of them coming which this movie just ignores they had set up. 

The first movie completely set up, any noise even whispering is enough to draw their attention. This one realising how fucked that is to tell a story downplays it so some noise is ok and it doesn’t instantly bring droves and droves of monsters.",nmnxqu
hhuq3cu,"Yeah there is a lot like the first movie that isn’t thought out properly. 

For instance as soon as governments figured out they hunted by noise there is multiple ways they would have taken advantage of that since they literally only hunt by noise and as we saw in the first one when there is enough noise it actually hides your presence. 

The song should have been played but in the sense of “we keep the song going because we can’t have someone there 24/7, but we do send people there and certain times throughout the day broadcast a message”. Bam problem solved that these guys just kept missing the broadcast because they don’t want to risk having music playing all the time. 

These are fun movies but the moment start thinking more about it, the less sense it actually makes that these aliens overran everything. Especially since they do have a weak spot being the inside of their head that could be hit since they do open it up every now and then. 

Not to mention pretty unbelievable their bodies would have the strength to survive say missles or tank rounds or a 50calibar shot.",nmnxqu

If Cillian's character had an emotional scene where he talked about wanting to end it all after losing his family, but having hope for the future when seeing the baby... then *maybe* the baby would have seemed useful at that point.

Beyond that, I feel like she should've addressed the point that her daughter clearly wanted to leave for a reason and happens to be a very headstrong girl, and thus may not even listen to the guy if he can find her. Did the son even bother to tell the mom and the guy what his sister's plan was and why she left in the first place, and the fact that he already tried to reason with her and begged her not to leave and she did anyway?

What did she expect him to do if her daughter is like ""nah I'm not going back""? Did she expect him to forcibly grab her and drag her back? If not, then she expects him to just go risk his life looking for her for possibly no reason and come back just to say ""oh well she didn't want to come back""?

And on top of that he can barely communicate with the girl effectively because he can't speak sign language, so it's no like he can easily have a conversation to convince her to come back. The mom should've like given him a note to give to the daughter from her saying ""you better get your fucking ass back here now because I made this guy risk his life to go and find you"".",nmnxqu

You can interpret this as either it is realizing it has nowhere to go now, or that it was checking for its friend. I like to think both since it makes them seem more interesting to me, but for the sake of the explanation we'll go with the first one. Is it convenient, yes, but for the sake of the movie I think that, just like any random every day dog, the creature had enough intelligence to not jump in the water until it got on land.

gztuz25,"I’ll never understand the insistence people have on characters needing to maintain collected and logical decision-making in movies like this. 

People do stupid shit all the time. People make the wrong call all the time. *Especially* in terrifying or stressful situations. You and I would both probably, inevitably, do something stupid if this happened to us. Yeah, it was a bad call for the son to leave the bunker, but he just watched his dad die, his sister has run off, and his mom just bounced, leaving him wounded and alone with an infant. He’s traumatized and terrified and in his panic he wanted to confirm in some way that she was coming back. It doesn’t make logical sense, but it makes *emotional* sense, and that’s more important when it comes to drama.

Asking “what’s the most level-headed and logical thing a person in this situation would do?” is pretty much the antithesis of compelling drama. Drama and conflict is mined from messy humanity and fallibility, so the better question is “what is the most compelling *wrong* decision a person in this situation could be making, given where they specifically find themselves both psychologically and emotionally?”",nmnxqu

-how she gonna leave her poor terrified potentially dying son completely alone with a 5 day old newborn

Worst of all the daughter must have learned nothing in these 450 days the most basic rule of survival is always have multiple exit points, she was on her own for one whole day before she got herself cornered and a half step away from getting torn apart if not for Emmett (and no not the mother who is responsible for her) saving her bacon at the last second yet again",nmnxqu

Not that they flew to Earth on spaceships. They are basically wild animals that have been thrown onto a noisy planet and they are trying to kill everything that makes noise. 

That sort of solves the ""why can't they figure out boats"" issue but them being wild animals makes a lot of different plot holes. There are a lot of island countries that should be safe from this. It doesn't make much sense that the world is fucked if these are just dumb animals that crash landed in one main area and they are not intelligent. It should have been quite simple to lure them, with sound, into an area and bomb them.

Getting a leg caught in a bear trap is a serious wound, even if it doesn't break the bones.

I didn't love either movie but I am glad that they didn't waste time regurgitating stuff that could be *shown rather than told*. I detest movies that dumb down to feed the audience exposition. Audiences that need spoon feeding shouldn't ruin movies for all of us. Just go watch movies that do so. 

For those who weren't paying attention, the monster has an exposed cochlear. There are multiple shots of it when it opens its mouth. That organ is especially sensitive to a certain radio frequency that their father discovered in part 1. To honour his legacy and to save the people, his daughter is determined to find a station to broadcast that frequency. This is her heroes journey. The reason her brother keeps checking the radio is to know whether she made it. The movie climax is when he is able to save his life by blasting his radio thanks to his sister. We are also reminded how brave she was to go on this journey seeing as a deaf person, she can't even tell when the broadcast is on. There's an emotional sub level here about their dad saving them from the grave or how their ordinary mum turned into a badass to keep them alive. 

Are there plot holes? Yep! But you not getting the most obvious plot point in the movie isn't one of them.",nmnxqu

gzx53ex,"Spot on, pretty much summed up how I felt. I hate scoring it relatively low since I really appreciate John Krasinski, Emily Blunt, and the rest of the cast for their performances plus the whole concept is really interesting but this just didn't hit like the first one. Nothing new in terms of lore really was a downer. The movie just didn't advance the plot at all. They stressed other humans being evil as a big part of this movie and they barely touched on it. No explanation as to the monsters either, I was expecting some ""government involved"" type of stuff which can be cliche, but if done right is really effective (maybe they'll touch on origins in Pt. 3 or spinoff.). Also like you said, the ending was definitely drawn out. The showing the children being brave was kinda corny and the whole hearing aid feedback thing in general was a bit overdone in this one. 

I also had a bone to pick with two particular things. One, the monster was able to ""swim"" in the first one. Yeah, the water was shallow and maybe was more of a tread than swimming, but felt like that was a mini plot hole just making them completely adverse to water. Two, the boat showing up on the island out of nowhere was a bit of a deus ex machina (or whatever the opposite of that is...google says diabolus ex machina).

Overall not terrible. There were no post credit scenes so you didn't miss much afterwards but def a lot of potential going forward. Cillian is the goat, his character also has a lot of potential. Hoping they go out with a bang in pt. 3 and the spinoff. Such a great concept, would hate to see it not thrive.",nmnxqu

Based on how quickly and easily they were able to attack on only Day 1, nobody stood a chance. 

We saw how indestructible they are; it took an exploding oxygen tank a foot away and it had no impact whatsoever it just walked right through the fire.

And by the way I'm actually scared for you when you said ""their heads can be exploded from a hunting rifle"".

Either you are really dumb or missed the entire point of the movie, but their heads are protected by that same indestructible armor that covers the rest of the body, it is just that their little hearing aid contraption produces a frequency that weakens the aliens and EXPOSES their head underneath the armor and that is how they are then able to shoot and kill them.

>What is the difference between the alien seeking/listening and the alien reacting to the cochlear implant feedback?

The sound actually causes them to malfunction, as opposed to functioning normally. It seems to weaken them and trigger a state of distress.

2- Cheap thrill I guess. Is one of them someone alive ready to jump the kid ? Is one of them someone that hang himself because the world is ending ?

Yeah.

>In this new film we can hear Emmett saying to Reagan “I’m not like him” (Lee). And Reagan telling him something like “you gotta articulate the words when you speak, REMEMBER?”

No, Regan said ""you're nothing like him"" earlier in the film and he later admits ""And you were right. I'm nothing like him. You are.""

She says ""Enunciate... Remember?"" because at the beginning of the film, on invasion day, Emmett asks her how to sign ""dive,"" indicating that as a family friend he makes an effort to communicate with her.

There's no indication whatsoever that Evelyn had a sexual relationship with Emmett. If Regan had been his biological daughter, she would probably have brought that up when begging him to go and save her life.",nmnxqu

The one in the water drowns, but I believe we are meant to think the one on the boat basically drifted to the island.

h3ofwvt,"I'm assuming it was a global invasion, so there weren't any nations not affected by them.

The Djimon Honsou character also explains why the military was not effective. They worked out fairly quickly that the creatures couldn't swim and organised boats to transport people, but the crowd went crazy, rushed the boats, started screaming, and were promptly killed. It's not hard to imagine that most if not all of the military were wiped out fairly quickly and it's only those on the fringes of civilization who have managed to survive.

It's also not that hard to imagine a threat that can theoretically be defeated fairly easily being almost impossible to overcome. Fleas are tiny and easy to kill but the Bubonic plague wiped out 50 million people.

The movies do require some suspension of disbelief, obviously, but I didn't find it too hard, especially since the focus is on the humans and their fight for survival, not the origins/nature/intentions of the creatures.",nmnxqu

h3riqbw,"I think they do but just come back afterwards to have an all you can eat buffet. 

As generally larger teeth are found on cannibals in the wild. So potentially they are just accustomed to all out battles against their rivals and don't consume anything apart from after that battle is over. 

I believe they came from an extremely dark world with very little to no oxygen and light as or else they wouldn't be able to survive on that meteor and that these things could potentially survive in the deepest depths of the ocean. It also seems like there were multiple meteors as if they can't swim and it would take them probably months/years to travel the ocean then how would they get to other continents meaning at the least you would see European/Asian Jets flying by constantly to help/survey the situation. So these areas must have been decimated as well.

Also it's obvious that high pitch sound hurts them but others do not. As an example if they were hurt by all sound then although a gun wouldn't do damage to their outer shell it would still stop them in their tracks and start making them do that whole mind blown spasm. Maybe not when only 1 gun was shot but when the army/national guard went after them they must have been under some heavy fire with multiple chaotic sounds going off around them and they seem to have survived.

What's very interesting as well is that they don't attack each other meaning 1. They will probably mate somehow and there could be a large nest now somewhere on earth and 2. That there other species not only on their planet but on those asteroids that could be just as tough.

All in all great concept and hope to see at least another movie of how things went down elsewhere on the planet.",nmnxqu

People see meteors at night all the time fizzle out and nobody really panics. They look in awe, share the moment. But in this situation, it was during the day, and massive. Nobody wants to be the one to scream and freak out. It's only when a few people start to leave that people start to think, okay, we should just get home at least, it's safe there, right?

Like there's news clippings in the first movie that says something like bullets and bombs don't work says military.

Like I can see small arms fire not working that well if their hide/armour is pretty dense, but we have high explosive incendiary AP rounds and Phalanx cannons to shoot them from, which can track missiles in flight to shoot them down before they hit ships.

That's not to even mention stuff like drone launched hellfire missiles, whether your armour is strong or not, having a 20lb warhead hit you at a thousand miles an hour is going to turn you in to paste.",nmnxqu

gzpsnay,"Writing down ""Don't consider your kids"" on my list of apocalypse reminders.",nmnxqu
gzy4xxq,"Yeah he could've just closed the garage and waited a bit before going back to his kids, but in retrospect his imagination probably went to the worst and he freaked out to the point of desperation",nmnxqu
h01ecwy,"That was the only part of the movie that I was baffled at.  The short screen time we get with his character he seems reasonable and grounded putting his kid in the closet with coats and telling them to be quiet, while he drives off attracting the monster.

All logical smart choices and then for no reason he suddenly becomes panicky and stupid just cause they needed a reason to remove his character from the screen...

It was a good movie but that section will forever make no sense to me the way it was handled.

It would have been better if he gave them the keys and then had him rush off in an attempt to distract the monster causing him to get killed at least that would have made more sense for what little screen time we got of his character.",nmnxqu
gzu4rkw,"He’s a good choice for something like this. Obviously he can carry a movie, but he’s got a lot of gravitas and personality in short appearances.",nmnxqu
gzx1yv8,"I think it helped to cast a known actor. It made the death more surprising. If it had been an unknown, I feel like the death would have been less shocking.",nmnxqu
gzu7b4n,I felt the same way about Scoot Mcnairy! His character doesn’t even get a name in the movie lol,nmnxqu
gzy2plq,"I read they originally cast Bryan Tyree Henry, who dropped out due to scheduling. He would make a little more sense in the role. Djimon may have just been a fan, or just realized the movie was good and wanted to be part of it. He probably only had a couple of days on set too. Easy money.",nmnxqu
gzxqapw,"I appreciated it because it felt like a little fake out. I assumed he might be a mainstay for the series because of his real-life profile, so it made it a little more shocking when he got wrecked.",nmnxqu
h0drc6f,Even weirder to cast Scoot McNairy as a man who I don't believe even has a line. Love Scott but it was kinda distracting just trying to figure out if that was really him the whole scene he was in.,nmnxqu
gzu2j8m,"I mean he's a multiple Oscar nominated Actors, that despite not always being in hits, is part of the Marvel universe, DC movie, Michael Bay Film, a Speilberg film, Tarzan and King Arthur movies, Barbershop universe and a big part of Gladiator.",nmnxqu
gzy53u2,Yeah to me that was a weak moment in the movie but I can also see how a character could make such a decision when thinking about his kid.,nmnxqu
h0nu8zo,"Even weirder was Scott McNairy being the leader of the weird boat people. That dude can act, and he showed up just to scream.",nmnxqu
gzvnfdw,It really sucked. His character didn't strike me as dumb but the way he died was kinda dumb which made me think it was sloppy writing.,nmnxqu
h0mwb8n,it was suppose to be Brian Tyree Henry but had to drop out for a scheduling conflict. (Probably either Godzilla vs Kong or Eternals),nmnxqu
h2ch72p,"I think it’s a thing, as well, where he’s a fairly well known and recognizable actor, so audiences aren’t expecting he’s just going to be on screen so briefly and die so abruptly.",nmnxqu
h19t7ge,He was a late replacement for that roll. The original actor pulled out when filming had already started.,nmnxqu
h3lvxrj,Good movie but that was weak writing ffs.,nmnxqu
gzs230z,He said he thinks the alien didn’t follow them and went back to town. They were supposed to be bait.,nmnxqu
gzu7z2d,"I think he was calm and collected while he was confident his plan was working, but the second he was uncertain and thought it might have returned to town he started to panic. Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth. If it really did return to town almost everybody he knows will be dead before they get the radio going and return to kill it. I can forgive him 10 seconds of panic for that situation, especially since their life has been basically normal for a year and a half.",nmnxqu
h01rm3n,People make careless mistakes in moments of panic. He hasn't had to survive the way the main characters have,nmnxqu
h1lwbgt,"The final act in the radio station was clearly meant to involve only Emmett and Regan, thematically. So as soon as he got them there run the car they needed him gone. I agree it was kinda weird how it just happened instantly like that though. They could have played it out a lot better than that.",nmnxqu
gzsoe57,Reminded me of Samuel L Jackson in Deep Blue Sea.  Saw it coming a mile away.,nmnxqu

gzy0dzx,Through two movies we haven’t seen them get too gorey so I’d chalk it up to that.,nmnxqu
gzucq0l,I think some of them flaked off of the meteor/ship as it passed the town.,nmnxqu
gzzkbxq,Well just think of how fast they run. You never really see the meteor land. So they land and just full on sprint towards the town that's making all that noise.,nmnxqu
h80saq3,"Just watched the movie and came here for the ending reviews but reading this comment got me thinking. Since things happened dramatically quick on day 1, how did Jim, yes I said Jim father newspaper clippings of the monster that he had posted In his basement? I’m pretty sure they showed that in the first movie. I know it’s was about over a year times passed but with the way day 1 went in movie two there is no way a mew news paper was being printed",nmnxqu
h03cdw0,"I don’t think he realised that they could only hear, I think he was just keeping people quiet because the monster couldn’t see into the restaurant and he didn’t want them to hear them as obviously hearing is a sense of most living things.",nmnxqu
h5aepq0,This. I really wanted to see more of the beginning.,nmnxqu
h1kl2v0,What is there to elaborate on? They simply got to their house as quiet as possible and probably went to bed. It works out well for them because they already have a deaf daughter so they know ASL.,nmnxqu

h3qr6gt,"I doubt it, as that's just a fan casting (though it's one of the better ones I've heard, him AND blunt would be great as Mr. Fantastic and The Invisible Woman).  I do hope he gets into the MCU eventually.  I'm glad he didn't get Cap though as Chris Evans totally transformed in that role.",nmnxqu

h6k75ve,Hey Goldenface... Go puck yourself,nmnxqu
h05ap8e,"I’m kind of necroing this thread but that whole dock scene blew me away. Emmet stabbing the guy in the leg and diving into the water, followed by him struggling to break free from the trap as pure chaos is occurring above him was just so amazing",nmnxqu
h13bgux,Yes! Marco Beltrami did an amazing job with the score!,nmnxqu
h5j35na,"omg i stayed till the end credits just to hear the music and it was SO UNSETTLING. very well done, the music really helped build the tension.",nmnxqu
gzx9ee6,True but there was also a literal Chekhov's Gun in the form of the gun she puts on the table that the boy kills the alien with.,nmnxqu
h0vtzns,"Yep. Knew it was coming back, but still loved how it got used!",nmnxqu
h07c28p,Literally,nmnxqu
h12k967,It was almost too telegraphed. Everyone knows you slide in baseball. You don’t dive. It was so out of place you knew it was coming back at some point.,nmnxqu
h5hv3vq,It’s funny you say that because I got the same indication from the shot early on of the incinerator latch. I knew someone was going to get trapped in there.,nmnxqu
h187r2t,"I honestly never remembered what he asked during the baseball game, but the sign he made during the docks scene made me immediately think dive.",nmnxqu
h40zfjw,Same!! I knew from the beginning that he will be a key character in the movie and somehow I already knew that he was the one saving the abotts,nmnxqu
h74j54l,Chekhov's gun,nmnxqu
h0wlbj8,Same lol,nmnxqu
gzrt00z,Marco Beltrami's score for the film is beautiful and the music that plays during this scene feels like you know shit is gonna go down fits so well.,nmnxqu
h5h0cah,"I thought it was ham fisted and knew as soon as she mentioned island that it would come up.

People don't yell dive when the runner is running. They yell ""slide"" or ""down""",nmnxqu
h6f6u1l,I don't agree. I knew it was coming as soon as they talked about there being a boat.,nmnxqu
h2q6gt7,Dammit came here to say this lol. “SWING AWAY”,nmnxqu
h43posv,You mean straight up stolen. Aliens. Baseball. Meh,nmnxqu
gzv7i2r,Could have easily just made it into a pop fly blooper into shallow left field or something and the kid just giving up on it. Definitely other scenarios where diving is appropriate,nmnxqu
h0d4bpa,"Exactly my first thought. Given how purposeful it was using the wrong word, it was pretty obvious that it was going to come back again.",nmnxqu
h08y7jq,It’s called a Chekov’s gun. Lazy screenwriting.,nmnxqu
gzvpo6k,Exactly what I said,nmnxqu
h5ih456,"Yeah, but it doesn’t make any sense for people yelling at him to dive in the field either. I think that would be more awkward honestly.",nmnxqu
gztdx5x,"It was, but it was also very well done. Something can be simple/ straightforward and still be great.",nmnxqu
gztpbj3,"Frequently these movies feel like they're written by somebody who's got the basics down hard and is showing their work like it's an assignment for a professor. Fortunately, they're also really entertaining and acted out by an extremely talented cast. I can forgive silly shit like the zoom on the towel holding the door open if the movie can keep me invested. This one certainly did.",nmnxqu
gzu27ko,Signposting or SIGNSposting?  Because as good as this movie was that referencing words from earlier baseball related to use later in surviving/fighting aliens was not at all original.,nmnxqu
gzq7zbg,"I think their bloodshot eyes implies scurvy which also kinda implies cannibalism.

Or maybe they fish?

But probably cannibalism.",nmnxqu
gzy1j29,"Am I awful for kind of coming to the conclusion/assumption that the creepy leader dude was gonna try and do something to Reagan? I noticed he took off her jacket and he kept looking at Emmett while like, touching/gripping her arm. I could be completely and totally wrong, but I feel like that’s what they were insinuating.",nmnxqu
h00gbva,I think they’re a cult worshiping the creatures. Emmit was a sacrifice to them,nmnxqu
h06i8g0,"They were just... wild. I'm guessing. The Abbotts were people who could adapt, but maybe other people can too- just differently. Reverting to silent savages might have worked for them. Or maybe they weren't at all. Maybe they were just a tribe of survivors who got by on looking out for themselves only and having no qualms about thieving, murder and kidnapping.",nmnxqu
gzrd4o2,"If you're a cannibal with loose standards on the definition of food, you'd contract a smorgasbord of diseases. Like how fish in the ocean gradually concentrate mercury into their tissues as you travel higher in the food pyramid. 

Notice how they all have leathery skin, bloodshot eyes, and a gaunt appearance. If they're travelling in a group, they'd all be feeding on the same things.",nmnxqu
h0vu9ur,Definitely a cannibal corps.,nmnxqu
h1z7ssk,I thought they might use the girl to repopulate or something equally disgusting. They already had a little girl right? And they didn’t seem interested in the family friend.,nmnxqu
h2rk8kt,I wondered if they caught a virus or something and that is what Cilian's wife died of? But canabilism makes a bit more sense. Do you think they were taking the girl to eat or to rape... or maybe to rape and then eat?,nmnxqu

gzznlwd,"I mean, he is just a kid. An incredibly traumatized kid. (Like his sister, who also dealt with it in a somewhat ill-advised but understandable way.) Ofc he makes terrible decisions. The bear trap thing was genuinely bad luck. I mean, their mom triggered the trip wire and she was moving much more slowly and carefully. By that logic she was even more of a fucking idiot. In the sequence of him looking for the mom I think it makes more sense because just before she left, his sister had also left and then the man who had saved them had left and now she’s leaving him too?! All alone with the baby?! All of this very very shortly after his father died. From his perspective, he must have been absolutely terrified that something might happen to them and that he was going to be left alone. If he hadn’t found the wife’s body he probably would have been fine. Was it a smart decision? Hell no. But was it a very  understandable decision? I think so.

About the time humanity is ready to declare victory, the smart aliens land and are the new threat for the movie.

Insert some alien tech in their helmets to cancel out the hearing aid interference and you have yourself another arc.


It may detract from the original feel of the first movie, but I think we're already past the point of it mattering.

gzxop3u,">!This. Djimon Hounsou mentions ""how'd you figure out [the song]?... that's determination"". I guess if you're really determined, you'd figure it out. Idk I would specifically want *determined* people on my island. No free-loading. No crazy people... especially that community on the docks. Plus, he mentioned what happened to the 10 boats the Coast Guard tried to load up... He was trying to keep *good, mindful* people safe. !<",nmnxqu
h01p3np,"Also, >!why did the dock people put the noise noose on Cillian? the aliens kill EVERYTHING that makes noise. having him make noise puts THEM in danger. just dumb.!<",nmnxqu
h04xq4w,FYI lots of record players have a replay setting to start the side over again.,nmnxqu

h0914hl,Bc thats boring. I’d only do it for maybe an hour or two a day.,nmnxqu
gztzfyg,"And did these aliens happen to land on every single island in the world? Because if not, surely there are thousands of colonies of people living relatively safe lives compared to the rest of the world. If any of these colonies had access to military aircraft, surely they could destroy these things? 

Also, didn’t an alien swim underwater in the first movie when the Mum was in the basement protecting the baby? Or did they just forget that? I suppose it was shallow enough for the thing to still stand...but that scene was obviously implying that these things can also swim, making even more potentially safe places seem dangerous. I think they must have retconned that to make the plot in the sequel happen.",nmnxqu
h071ckk,There's no reason why the crazies wouldn't be able to figure it out.,nmnxqu
gztyp0p,"Well isn’t that the risk they take by broadcasting a message at all? And do you honestly think they’d feel less guilt about being safe by leaving a cryptic message that obviously so few people have deciphered? As opposed to leaving a message that could have saved so many more lives? These island people seem like jerks, honestly. 

Even if the island was overrun with refugees, they’d have more manpower to grow livestock, crops, go fishing, maybe even collect more boats to access neighbouring islands around and set up their own little colonies? 

It would be great if the movie even hinted at what you’re suggesting, that the island was afraid of being overrun with people. But that’s not in there at all. In fact, as soon as Emmett and Regan show up, the island seems nothing but welcoming to them.",nmnxqu
h0wxhrz,"They didn’t have the proper tools to do it? At the end of the movie, Regan uses the microphone (which is fully operational and working fine) to broadcast the frequency from her hearing aid. 

There is absolutely no reason why they couldn’t have recorded something, or at least had someone at the studio talking into the microphone to AT LEAST tell people that the aliens can’t swim. 

Think of how many people could have been saved with this vital piece of information. Instead, they opted to play a song...but sure, it allows the movie to happen, so why not?",nmnxqu
h1m6clu,Didn't have the proper tools? Bro there was literally a microphone and the island didn't have any aliens on it. Could have just had someone stationed there during the day hosting his own damn podcast on the best island bonfire recipes.,nmnxqu
h23qjxz,"They absolutely have the means to at least broadcast a message. You said it yourself, they have a microphone, so get someone stationed at the studio to send this message daily. Seriously, the amount of lives they could have saved by doing this could have been in the thousands, but that wouldn't have allowed the rest of the movie to happen. It's dumb as hell.",nmnxqu

gzraak2,So Hawaii would be a safe haven,nmnxqu
h20nb4s,"No, but it’s not like their existing radio approach had any way to weed out bad people. Their broadcast was a puzzle, not a morality test.

(If you say it's make noise you could probably push them out then start them. But then again docks are creaky) Also how and why did they use like a sound booby trap? If it's used...then... the monsters come to..where you are? I don't get it.,nmnxqu

h05506c,Lmao being in the mental health field myself all I could think about was how great of a job they did showing Noah's anxiety thru this movie. Although a lot of his decisions were bad and his judgment at times was poor it was clear that he was struggling staying calm and couldn't think straight. It was very real and ultimately realistic. How many young kids WOULD stay alone in a bunker when everyone they love has gone out to their possible deaths and just be okay with it? He was scared and was exploring to make sure they are safe and alive.,nmnxqu

h03nzvi,"I think the beginning of part 2 showed just how quickly the aliens took over. No one had a chance tbh. I think the alien even covered up when the police officer  shot at it , plus the mum used the fire and it had no effect. Dijimon Honsous character covered how the military tried to get more people to island but it all went bad. The aliens are completely impervious to anything unless they’re head is opened up properly.

h0159jx,"Cuz they lived on a farm, out and about and usually on the sand path. Add bare feet to the mix and they walk with almost complete silence. Cillian's character stuck himself inside a box for the better part of a year and almost never left, so that's why HE had boots.",nmnxqu
h0lzofm,I think he was barefoot when he saved Regan in the train car though.,nmnxqu
h0eqmwu,"What he is referring to is the fact that Djimon basically had an expressionless face with a super disciplined set of behaviors while he was getting into and driving the car out of town to lure the monster. 

However, once he gets out of the car he 180s talking to Cillian and is suddenly incredibly concerned about his children and how he needs to get back to them right this second and just immediately dies as a result. He knew about the ear piece so his best bet either way was to help Cillian and the girl so it was odd/funny that he starts freaking out and fulfills the black-guy dying first trope in horror movies.",nmnxqu

gzrch7c,"Haha I think you answered it. If you are a natural loud snorer, you die. If you aren't smart enough to quickly figure out you have to be completely silent, you die. If you have any condition or situation that doesn't allow you do be fully self-sustaining and absolutely quiet at all times, you die.

This is insane. So then what, they leave him alive in the trap, and later on they either kill him anyway or they have to get him out of the trap without making noise and without running the risk of him attacking them?

These people are literally by an ocean and get go fishing and get on a boat to live safely. There is literally no reason for them to be acting this way. Heck, they can even quietly go to a store because from the little we've seen, there are clearly still items available in the stores (ex: meds and oxygen tank). Instead, they lure people in using that little girl for whatever reason. 

I could understand people regressing like that after decades or if there are literally no other options, but I find it really hard to suspend my disbelief for some reason that they would regress like this after 1.5 years.

gzpy09e,"Lmao you got me, I didn’t write a 500 word essay detailing every problem I had. Sorry, I forgot this was supposed to be a professional review and not a casual Reddit discussion thread. But you want more details, here ya go. 

Character development: The son: none. His role in this movie is getting his leg hurt. Emily Blunt: also none. She really has nothing to do here. The daughter: She’s a self sufficient and determined character at the beginning of the movie and that’s what she is at the end as well. All her development came in the first movie. Cillian Murphy guy: Sure he develops a little. Goes from selfish to sacrificial. Not the most creative thing ever but I’ll admit I overlooked that. Even still, one character having a dash of cliched development does not mean my opinion is “contradicts and factually incorrect”, as you put it. 

Also worth noting that you completely ignore my other complaints. The aliens are all dispatched in the exact same way (make feedback, go for the head), no new creature types or interesting lore is added to their mythology. This felt extremely lazy and is the biggest reason I said this was the same movie as part 1 but with different locations. 

The overarching plot is also thin as tissue. They find an old friend at a steel mill and then half of them go to an island, we get 5 mins of Djimoun and the movie abruptly ends. That’s it. Just like doing nothing new with the aliens, not exploring a new found community that was living in safety was a huge miss in terms of world building. You can say “they’ll explore it in the sequel” but that doesn’t make this movie any better. 

But anyway, like I said, I didn’t hate it but thought it was mediocre and a step down from the first one. If you liked it then good for you but I found your response condescending and entirely unconvincing",nmnxqu

I understand the film and was able to connect the dots in the story because it’s not complicated, I’m just pointing out obvious flaws that were clearly overlooked post production. 

Sorry, none of your counter-points change my mind, but rather solidify that this film has some strange cult fan base where any clear flaw is chalked up to ‘the viewer just needs to pay more attention’, even though everyone was mumble vocal frying and the plot holes in the story telling could fit an entire skyscraper.

Obviously I was joking about the alien driving the boat. But if it was on the boat - and the boat ended up on the island - is my explanation really more unlikely?

Please explain 1 though! Why TF are they sending cryptic song messages over the radio. It seems like “hey the monsters drown in 6 feet of water” would be more effective.",nmnxqu

But those movies are miles and miles more enjoyable because they've nailed down their formula. Characters are relatable, vulnerable, funny, everything you can think of.

In quiet place its just... Seriousness.. No emotion outside of that. And it's not very imaginative in terms of plot. It's just a family trying to survive which we already saw from the first movie and countless others in this genre. Gets boring after a while

Except that we know that it doesn't, otherwise John Krasinski's character would have heard the song on his radio.

> The people now have an effective weapon so I suppose if there's a sequel, it's following how this new information is passed on across the world and how smarter or more resourced characters are able to harness it

Okay yeah, that's true, but the movie should have actually ended that way then.  There should have been some larger payoff for all the risk and destruction she helped cause. Instead, all she did was broadcast the noise to her brother, which she could have done if she just stayed with them to begin with. Expecting the audience to just assume that she saved humanity is just lazy writing and/or a cliffhanger. We don't even really know how many survivors there are out there to save anyway, especially when we just saw the last little safe haven for survivors get destroyed. (Did the island have any survivors? I have no clue!)

The movie was missing a scene showing the mom/brother joining them in the end, and the island being rebuilt with a radio/speaker barrier around it or something like that. At least *some* sense that her idea was worth the trouble and that she didn't just accidentally kill a whole island of people by having a monster follow her there.",nmnxqu

h59674s,"Not going to go through the entire synopsis of the movie just to prove my point but I did enjoy the movie, as I've mentioned it was very original. Only wished it didn't have such sloppy writing and loose ends that really take away from the film

I dont think lack of empathy is the problem as the cast did a great job. Don't believe acting was an issue here as that is what it takes to empathize with a character. It was really piss poor writing and the lack of attention to detail that hindered my enjoyment. 

It is the job of an entertainment platform to convince me enough to enjoy it no matter the genre or situation. I am convinced that this movie was just another subpar 2nd part to a trilogy just for profitability. Fuck, this ain't no LOT.",nmnxqu
h5vwk39,"Great point. 

I think some of those character decisions that felt very ""horror-logic"" (or just unbelievable) are at least partially a function of the brisk pace and short runtime. It has its benefits - the movie doesn't have a ton of lulls, which is great for a suspenseful horror movie, but at times I felt it sacrificed the buildup of character motivation and viewer immersion. 

I do wonder if a little more room to develop those motivations could have strengthened those character choices. In an era of long-form content, another 30 minutes to address these complaints wouldn't have bothered me. Maybe it would have undermined the suspense, hard to say.",nmnxqu

h2irh62,"Bruh, the monsters can't see... That's the whole point of the movie. How could it know its friend drowned.",nmnxqu
gzvtoe8,"Fair enough, the alien definitely seemed to have to some sort of reaction when his partner drowned. Whether it knew that it was from the water, or they have telepathic communications and its partner ceased to exist in its head or it was something as simple as it could no longer hear the basic clicking sounds it normally makes.

but if we are talking about survival instinct it seems their ONLY instinct is to destroy whatever is making noise and that would probably override any instinct about water, it seems that noise causes them physical pain even from far away so I really think the need to seek and destroy the noise as the alien sits there in excruciating pain fighting off the urge to go full speed towards all those noises would eventually, if not very quickly, take over, especially since we know it took hours if not a full day to make land shore from the dock. That would be some seriously impressive restraint skills that these aliens have never been shown to have",nmnxqu

* Your brother just got seriously injured and requires medical care
* The family literally has a tiny newborn that needs to be taken care of
* And the dude that you're staying with just said he wants you all out by tomorrow

At this point the girl is the only one with uninjured legs in the family and she abandons them all - and also takes the shotgun.


Another blatantly stupid decision was Cillian approaching the little girl on the docks. It was a super obvious trap. But we can use suspension of disbelief to say okay she reminded him of his daughter so he wasn't thinking. Still a stupid decision given his current situation.",nmnxqu

I’m pretty sure they weren’t going there just to do that were they? I thought they were just trying to lead the alien away from the village. It just felt so forced and contrived. And it didn’t make any sense that the people on the island had no plan in case aliens came to their island.

h2hx0io,"I think this movie is a special case though. Like seriously, there were at least 3 people around me with nachos, as well as a bunch of other people with crinkly chip bags, eating throughout the entire movie. The theater wasn't even 1/3 full of people and literally every single quiet scene the only thing you could hear was a surround-sound chorus of plastic sounds going CRINKLE CRINKLE CRACK CHOMP CRUNCH CRINKLE SQUEAK CRACK CRUNCH CHOMP CHOMP CRINKLE CRINKLE CRUNCH. Kind of takes away from the mood of the movie and intended effect of the quiet / deaf scenes...

And look, I understand this is how theaters make money. I kind of hoped that most people would finish their food in the first like 20min and then sit still, as that's usually what I and most people I know seem to do... I generally also try to be somewhat tactful when at the theater and pause eating for a moment when there's a really quiet dramatic scene. Or at the very least I don't choose to FUMBLE AROUND TRYING TO OPEN A BAG OF CHIPS at that very moment. Of course most movies aren't anywhere near this quiet and there's plenty of music and noise and explosions to mask the food noises, so I did expect it to be a bit more annoying.

But I swear to fucking god... the group near me was eating nonstop from the trailers all the way until the very last scene of the movie. I don't know if they got double nachos or just ate really slowly, but there was not one single moment when they could pause the unending stream of plastic crinkling and chip fumbling and mouth crunching. I just don't understand why people need to eat constantly and can't pause even for the most dramatic, tense, quiet moment.

gzq79lp,Thanks!,nmnxqu
gzsesjd,Yes I want this.,nmnxqu
gzu0zhp,"Oh sorry! My mom and I were just curious. They kept showing the leaking faucet. My bad! We were just confused, because oxygen itself actually isn’t flammable!

h1a68bh,Moving her body and digging a grave probably would have made a lot of noise,nmnxqu
h1oo1uc,"Thank you! Omg the oxygen box sounds awful, I think just that part would give me anxiety lol. I didn’t see the first one either but I know the plot. I like hearing the plots of movies like this even though they are too intense for me to enjoy watching....weird I know.",nmnxqu
h2iiup5,"Thanks for that. But then how did he know to keep quiet in the first place? 

In that situation it seems you would run off if you didn’t know they react to sound, rather than taking cover in a cafe right by the entrance and know to be quiet. This made me think he already knows they can’t see but react to sound.",nmnxqu
h3ox5mf,Okay I forgot that part at the beginning then. And sorry about writing “articulate” LoL I saw the film in Italian and that’s what she says.,nmnxqu
h3nt5sm,"thanks for this, it just seemed weird to imagine that alien calmly rowing the boat with his bladed arms. Anyway, it would must likely die of exhaustion since his knife arms have too little a surface area to paddle.",nmnxqu
h3ohqt7,"Emmet didn't leave the house because of sadness. He said he had to leave the house because his wife was sick, and screaming with pain (therefore attracting the creatures). So he brought her to the shelter and she died there.",nmnxqu
h3og5so,"Yeah, this is just human nature when you're hiding from something.

I also don't agree that ""you'd panic and keeping running and trying to escape."" They'd already seen that the creatures move much faster than humans. And the instinctive response to human nature is actually ""fight, flight or freeze."" Sometimes staying still is the right move.",nmnxqu

h4p1i7l,that makes sense! thanks :),nmnxqu
h4vkr6q,And were the people on the dock cannibals? Like they’d resorted to cannibalism? And they wanted to eat Reagan? And why were their eyes red? Was it from infection from filthy living conditions? From eating people? They tried to make them seem like zombies almost.,nmnxqu
h58cpms,Wait it was knocked free from the mooring? Definitely missed that part lol though it doesn't seem likely it would drift all the way to the island rather than just around the dock.,nmnxqu
h669e25,How ? Like they two drove the boat and got into the island’s shore right? So was the creature in the boat  all the time while they were driving from that place to the island? I can’t figure it out lol,nmnxqu
h88ocb6,"What about food, electricity, etc",nmnxqu
h7b1iij,How did it get on the boat and they didnt know?,nmnxqu
h866ayp,"Right. A meteorite would have hit the planet with the impact of several nuclear detonations, and presumably there would be many of them to drop the creatures all over the Earth.

That's why it would have to be ships and an intelligent race dropping the creatures here.

However, that depends on if the writers bothered thinking that stuff through, and we didn't see any evidence of some master race descending to Earth after their attack dogs cleared the planet of its native inhabitants.",nmnxqu
h9e6xww,"Ahhh okay, I missed that. Thanks!",nmnxqu
hbazhcy,That was the vibe I was getting also.,nmnxqu

h05t0qr,Have you ever been a 12 year old boy lol,nmnxqu
h0or3xm,Agreed. And he literally just had his foot caught in a bear trap lol. I don’t think he would actually be able to wander around exploring,nmnxqu
h0vtnqj,"That was basically my one complaint in the movie. It made zero sense. I loved the movie, but like, what the fuck was he doing? And then it didn't factor into the plot at all *other than* him summoning more aliens with his fearful screams.

I was also a little bit confused as to why Reagan went onto the train. To check for first aid kits? Or did she just happen to find that?",nmnxqu
h1klflm,I thought he wanted to get up higher so he can see if their mom is coming. Discovering the corpse and whatnot was just a coincidence.,nmnxqu
h18tpun,I think at that point he suspected the guy of lying his wife and kids. He wanted to investigate.,nmnxqu
h11z3sv,"it also made no sense in that he was a complete pussy afraid of everything. he had just begged his mom not to leave him, so why would he leave the relative safety of the hatch to go up there? (especially when he was the sole protection for his infant sibling). his character was so annoying to me.",nmnxqu
h3mdfpf,A bit late to this but I just watched it there. I'm pretty sure he went up as the mother had said that her trip would be a matter of hours. He seemed to be wondering where she was and probably wanted to go up high to see if he could see her coming,nmnxqu
h5em60j,">annoyed at Noah's pointless decision to leave safety and wander out in the upper floors of the warehouse

I think he was just scared as he was alone with a baby for a long time. Some people deal with fear by staying put. Some have to go and look around.",nmnxqu
h45yb6s,Yeah I wish they had shown less of the kids for this reason. The actors are doing a good job but they are being directed to act like stupid kids which aren't what you want to see. It's annoying when plot points are driven by stupidity.,nmnxqu
h90ikm6,Noah did it because it's bad writing. It doesn't seem like either of these movies are capable of creating friction without bad cause and effect writing mostly done by the kids. If there were no kids in these movies there would be nothing happening because only they are stupid enough to do the things that cause all the action.,nmnxqu
h3ec3v0,I thought he went up with the radio to see if he could get any different radio stations? Since it didn't work in there underground lare.,nmnxqu
h6i8nqr,That annoyed me so much. Was he just bored? That much??,nmnxqu
iacuvgh,He drove me insane the entire movie,nmnxqu
h05uyh2,I think Millie got a lot of screen time because this story is her continuing her dads legacy of helping the family survive,nmnxqu

Crying baby 🙁

Yup this is what I’ve been missing haha, but of course I shouldn’t be surprised after everything that insensitive people are still insensitive.",nmnxqu

h02j7nc,"Abandoned her mother in the first movie in the middle of a lethal alien invasion,, causing her father to have to go look for her, indirectly leading to his death, though I think it was directly but meh.

Not having learned a valuable lesson at the expense of her father's life, then abandons her family again in the second movie, still during the middle of a lethal alien invasion, resulting in her mother somehow pussy whipping the family friend in to leaving his relatively safe camp to go out to look for her, which could have caused her death and that of the family friend.

Little brother dead, father dead, but no lesson learned, and continues to act like she can do whatever she wants in the middle of a lethal alien invasion ,putting others at risk. Yep I feel like slapping her.",nmnxqu
h01jv4i,But he went up above and drew the monster on then like it was stupid,nmnxqu
h01zm66,"It's not the acting for me, it's literally the things the script makes him do. Why wouldn't he check the oxygen on the tank? Why wouldn't he just stay put, not to mention how is climbing up stairs with a fucked up foot with no pain meds? Getting them locked in the airtight tub, it's all non sensical",nmnxqu
gzq7etn,Same here. So what are they doing? Hunting us for sport? For purpose? Because they are designed to destroy all life?,nmnxqu
gzup3fz,"They explicitly do not eat their kills, which is noted on the dad’s wall in the first movie.  One of the theories fans came up with was that their biology is incompatible with anything on our planet, so they can’t eat the things they kill, but they just keep killing in the hope that they eventually find something edible.",nmnxqu

h4bypu4,"It seems logical for an alien species to send some super predator to wipe out humanity and let the animals do it for them because why risk your own.

Drop these things on the planet, let them do their job for 50 years, come down spray something in the atmosphere that triggers a gene that renders them safe somehow, or use your own jeans so when they smell you they think you're one of them.",nmnxqu
h43o33t,"I wonder all of this too. Mainly, what do they eat? If they aren't hunting humans for food, what the fuck is up with their aggression towards them? What is motivating them? And II starts around a year and a half mark, what are all the aliens doing now that most everyone is gone? God. I need to know.",nmnxqu
h0nlr1x,"There’s a lot of decaying bodies in the film, never any half-eaten bodies. I don’t think there’s any evidence that they eat humans",nmnxqu

h3pj8q6,"Not really hiding are they, they're in the open of a restaurant, it's assumed tho, that in plain sight in doesn't matter as long as they're quiet.",nmnxqu
gzyz554,"Thanks for really fleshing out that thought! I'm in agreement with you now here, a falling object in the sky would cause more curiosity than anything because it is so foreign and it would be hard to perceive it as a threat. It makes me wonder about the realistic reaction to say, seeing Godzilla marching in on your town. My thought would be that would induce the panic I was calling for, since it would be much easier to react to a large animal as a threat, but maybe not!",nmnxqu
h06i7wd,"I agree, but i just wanted to point out that if you see an asteroid that massive come down on you, you are going the way of the dinosaur. Doesnt matter if you panick or not. In that situation, I would probably stand still as a mouse and enjoy my last few breaths of non-incinerated air.",nmnxqu
h8zrcax,"I'm REAL late to the party, but IMO, it has to do with sound on comparison to the natural sound surrounding them. Them not being able to swim is a natural byproduct of wherever they're from not having naturally occurring bodies of water.",nmnxqu
h3lvhdk,Definitely after the way it ended.,nmnxqu
h0mqfzc,"I think Krasinski said they're just surviving through space on asteroid(s) after the home planet exploded. Doesn't sound like they're really planning any invasion, just hibernating or something until they hit another planet.

As for the chances of that asteroid breaking apart into meteorites and landing in every island/continent? Yeah it's not very likely. Might be explained in the next film, might just be left unexplained. 

Like most sequels, the introduction of new info ends up raising more questions about the original info. For example why were the newspapers with details about the creatures (seen in the first movie) still getting delivered to the town when we see normal town life clearly went out the window at minute 1? 

Still enjoyable movies though, a bit of questionable lore won't bother me provided they're not contradicting major plot elements.",nmnxqu
h1gnsy4,Are we certain it was meteors as opposed to some sort of deliberate travel? I’m not so clued up on the lore.,nmnxqu
h0i5jfn,The creatures are flipping cars and breaking through metal/concrete structures like they’re nothing. I don’t know why it’s assumed they couldn’t do anything against tanks or armored vehicles.,nmnxqu
h0hehdp,Maybe there were so many they got overrun by numbers alone?,nmnxqu
h3lr13z,That is literally shown in the movie as having no affect (fire).,nmnxqu

h00xamv,[deleted],nmnxqu
h1pgfym,"Agreed, but what throws this off imo is the newspaper in the first movie saying ""they go to sound"" or whatever. Obviously that's as just a plot tool but as is it implies that there was time for newspapers to be written, printed, and distributed before everything fell apart.",nmnxqu

h01c30v,I think it had more to do with his lack of experience surviving from the aliens. Cillian immediately knew to gtf out of there because the alien was probably lurking.,nmnxqu
h1jg4rk,I think it was also to show how he wasn't 100% survival mode since living out on the island just chillin since the first attack. He did act accordingly at the start when the monster attacked but when it came down to keeping his emotions in check he fell apart. Very similar to when Rick and crew come to Alexandria in The Walking Dead if you've seen that. Compared to all the other characters who have been survival mode the past year straight pretty much.

These movies aren't really horror in the jump scare sense so much as suspense movies. They let you know the rules, let you see the setup so you know what's coming, then you're in suspense as you wait for it to happen.",nmnxqu

We only got a super quick glimpse at the “paradise” life going on at the island, and only interacted with one character from there before he promptly was killed off. There’s still plenty to learn about this place. How about those bandits/scavengers? Who are they and why aren’t they going to the island? Do the island folks know about them? We also seem to have reached a new stage of weaponizing the hearing aid device via radio… but we really only see it used to kill 2 aliens.

The only thing that may inhibit their signal could be that the meteor also created interference with it.

The stakes felt so much lower than the first movie (they already know how to combat the creatures with their amplifier), the tension didn't amount to anything tangible, the character development was minimal at best (little kid shoots the monster after screwing things up), and nearly every problem the characters encountered was self-created.

>they lure people in using that little girl for whatever reason. 

I don't think they were luring them in so much as trying to capture them once they'd already invaded their turf. 

I think the Djimon Honsou character explains the phenomenon best when he says that when people in the cities first realised the creatures couldn't swim, boats were organised to transport people offshore, but instead of forming orderly lines, the people rushed the boats, there was screaming, the creatures wiped out the crowds and only two boats got away. So fear made people act irrationally very quickly, to their own detriment.

It's also plausible that if some people felt they had to fight other people for food/provisions/survival in the early days, that instinct took over. Lee and Evelyn's family didn't really have to do that.

I'd also add that some people were probably jerks to begin with, and maybe they stuck together. The pedophiles and murderers have to find somewhere to live along with everyone else, and maybe they formed a colony - the kind of colony where they don't mind using a little girl as bait to catch a stranger.",nmnxqu

Movie’s aren’t thought-puzzles for us to pick apart intellectually, they’re dramatic, emotional experiences that are, on a fundamental level, abstractions. 

A great example of this is the T-Rex sequence in JURASSIC PARK. The moment when the kid shines the light into T-Rex’s eye; the way its pupil dilates is amazing and scary at once. This seems to be a real thing! And it’s right there, inches away! *Every second* of that scene is incredible and perfect; you could write an entire book about just that eight or so minute stretch of film. What’s *most* incredible, though, is the way the scene works completely on its own terms despite making *no real world sense whatsoever*. How did the trams end up back at the T-Rex paddock? How did the T-Rex eat the goat and climb up on the road when it is established after this scene that there’s a hundred foot drop on the other side of the wall? Sometimes movie making is magic, and sleight of hand is a magician’s best friend; Spielberg knows that in the grand scheme of things, all of these inconsistencies barely register in the face of something working dramatically.

As far as this movie is concerned, yes, I know that they can’t physically *see* anything, but they can register things via sound, and the other alien was obviously making a bunch of noise thrashing and drowning, which they took note of.

we also have no idea how much comfort they were living in at first on the island maybe the first year they were in absolute terror and in silence until enough time past where they assumed they were in the clear.

That said, at this stage of the movie he should have been fully capable of making rationale decisions. He was just not smart along with the rest of his family. Which begs the question - what mother leaves a newborn alone with a 12 year old after barely climbing a ladder with a gump foot? Especially, in such a dire situation? Not only that, but why would a 14-year old deaf girl leave her family in search of what might be lost hope?

A: A bear trap would have MOST DEFINITELY shattered his leg. No doubt. But for ""movie law"" let's say it didn't, he still would not be up and walking.

I mean, I totally get you, I would be mad at her too if i was a member of her family. Hell, i'm often mad for the members of my own family for less daredevil things they try to pull off.  
But that is the point of this movie - risk is absolutely a requirement if you aim to change things. The bigger the change - the bigger risk is required.  
Then, of course, there's space to discuss if the risks taken were reasonable. I would argue that, first off, you can't expect a teenage girl to be reasonable and secondly if you or me were making a call here the only thing we would deem reasonable is to sit in the relative safety of underground refreshing our supplies when required.  At which point William Wallace's speech comes to mind.",nmnxqu
h2il563,"Honestly, your critique paints the writing of the movie as clunky and I agree. I think it's not just a problem with one character but rather the whole plot and character actions of many characters. 


We're talking about a dude who explicitly didn't ever venture out to the nearby fire, not even once, cuz he was so conservative with his exploration.

Maybe wherever they came from has a lower atmospheric density, so they’re used to really faint sounds",nmnxqu
gzqmkso,It could just be instinct. It doesn't really make much sense when you think about it. If a tree falls in a forest do they all go sprinting to the forest? What about every day when birds are chirping? They would be running around 24/7.,nmnxqu
gzvmhrc,"People have theorized they're a weapon sent by a more advanced species to wipe out other civilizations so they can use their planet for its resources, as invading and causing war would result in destroying much (if not all) of the planet and said resources, especially if they're aware we have nuclear weapons. Send a weapon that would basically be pointless to use a nuke against.

Based on the fact monsters seem relatively dumb/animalistic and don't seem like they'd have the intelligence needed to navigate space and invade planets on their own.

They supposedly came here on a meteor(s), so maybe their homeworld was destroyed/blown up and a piece(s) of it landed on our planet and now they're just clearing out the rival species that could pose a threat to them.

It makes way more noise so would attract more of them. You have to remember these things came from a meteorite that seemed to land somewhere within hundreds of kilometres away and the monsters (as we also saw in the movie) were fast enough to get into the town and basically destroy it within 10-20 minutes, with just a couple of them.

You're not getting any kind of organised military reaction within thirty minutes. Military bases would be absolute chaos and wiped out within hours.

Sure, a small number of planes and helicopters would get out, but they're absolutely fucked because there's no way they can land and refuel without being destroyed. They'd all be useless within a day. Nobody would be able to co-ordinate them as ground control would all be destroyed.

Can a tank survive an attack from one of the monsters? Maybe, we don't know. Doesn't particularly matter though because their tracks would definitely be destroyed so they wouldn't be able to move. So you'd just have a stationary bit of artillery that's going to what? Start opening fire at incredibly fast moving enemies in the middle of a friendly base? Even if the tank could hurt them, which they established they can't, you'd be destroying more humans than monsters.

There would definitely be boats that got away, but they're totally unable to access the resources of the military as save for a few bases around the world, the vast majority of military bases are on the mainland. Any boats that got away would just become like the island colony in the movie, find somewhere safe and survive there.",nmnxqu

And of course there was the scene of Marcus finding the decomposing remains of Emmett's wife. I assume that's what that was.

I guess he kept her because there was no opportunity to bury her without alerting the monsters. For half a second I thought ""oh he's gone crazy."" Even before that I had a split-second thought: ""I bet he ate his wife and child and has gone nuts as a result""

It’s when I realized pain is relative, and also pain is limitless. The bear trap hit his bone ... I’d imagine that is an exponential amount of pain. 

I’ve never had kids but I imagine childbirth is the same way without drugs. Hence why also Emily blunt’s character screams in pain when she’s in labor even when she knows an alien is otw/in her house. She tries her best to stifle it, but pain takes hold of every cell in your body when it hits and at times the screaming cannot be stopped no matter how hard you try.

This idea (pipe-dream? request?) doesn’t fit with the story though. After seeing the sequel, I realize that this specific story is solely centered around this family of survivors - didn’t really need a sequel to realize that but still. Sure, they’ve all become more proficient with weapons, but having a trilogy that becomes action oriented just seems like it would fit the universe.

If you break down the creature in the film it's basically a dumb animal with no sight or intelligence and incredible plot armor/suspension of disbelief. There's no virus that wipes out most of the population etc...

Contrasted with something like the Xenomorph which in its first two films the directors/writers did a great job of showing its life-cycle, vulnerabilities, intelligence when in numbers/hive hierarchy. Their suspension of disbelief is far stronger and obviously these films are not only great horror films but just some of the best films ever made period.

gztq5zg,"Agreed. An explanation would be catastrophic. One of the best parts of these movies aside from the mystery of it all is that dialogue is precious. If they make another one, they'd absolutely kill it by having expository dumps about where the aliens came from, what they want, what they eat, etc. It would feel just like any other alien movie that's come out in the last forty years.

If I was going to entertain the idea that it’s not safe to give away your location, why not at least broadcast the message that the aliens can’t swim? Think of how many lives they’d potentially save by doing that. 

It just seems like they played the song to explain why Emmett hadn’t yet left his place, because if the island had done the logical thing and broadcasted a recorded message instead of a song, then the events of the movie wouldn’t have been allowed to play out.",nmnxqu

I'm sure in a big group like that there would be at least one person who could put two and two together that a radio-station nearby was broadcasting (hell I think you can literally see radio-towers on the island from the mainland shore).

You and your young son or daughter is battling a tiger and can quickly press a button to close a gate to stop it from mauling you to death but he/she takes their time to dramatically press it and in the process of taking so long your leg has been mauled... All of this to press the button because of dramatic effect whilst you're bleeding out on the floor. 

All I was thinking in this scene was just ""PRESS THE FUCKING BUTTON YOU GOD DAMN MORON"". It's typically slasher movie crap.  

There are better and less ridiculous ways to build drama. It was almost cringe-worthy IMO, especially since the rest of the film kind of played out rather quickly.

Risk is always the order of the day when in battle, but calculated risk over reckless abandonment of your team, family, partners, etc.

I'd argue that the reason they don't really eat is that cause they hunt by noise, maybe Earth things make too MUCH noise so they're in constant kill mode over the slightest thing",nmnxqu
gztp5rg,So why aren't they all just attacking a single waterfall?,nmnxqu
h01ml1s,"Not true. If that were true they'd be hunting constantly, not stalking humans for hours at a time. 

'oh, you made a noise and now a creature is running full speed in your direction? Not a problem, because a cricket just chirped right behind it and it did a complete 180. And then several hundred other critters made their evening noises so the alien is literally going insane essentially spinning in place deciding which one to attack, and you and your family are free to do whatever.'

'oh, the creature by some miracle of God made it to your house? Don't worry, instead of stalking you all night, a mouse made a noise outside so the alien did a 180 and wooshed right back outside never to be seen again.'

No, the aliens only chase humans. It is as of yet unexplained how they determine that humans are the ones that made the noise.",nmnxqu
h0cuxcb,"They make noise, too. I wonder why they aren't running at each other all the time. Maybe they give off a scent or something.",nmnxqu
h21429l,"These things cannot see, and they aren't particularly smart. I refuse to believe they managed interplanetary travel. Those things were sent to earth to destroy it. Humanity, now crippled, is far less advanced and cannot fight back against whoever sent it. I wonder how the next part addresses this.",nmnxqu
h2ilkdl,But what about each other? Why don't they attack each other? They literally make so much noise crashing into cars and shit but they never attack one another.,nmnxqu
h3roleb,"They can't be sensitive to sound because if that was the case then say hello to insects and random wildlife noise. They'd NEVER be in forests or large open fields because the sound would drive them off. The only place I'd see creatures like this in would be in a city after removing the humans from it. I can see that being somewhat ""quiet"" compared to other areas where humans have made less of an impact.

Also they should have muted the ambient noise(to make it seem like creatures actually killed \*everything\* making noises) while shooting this movie. It would have made the experience FAR more enjoyable. When you see them scared of walking on some leaves when you have crickets chirping in the background? Yeah that just doesn't fly with me. I'm sure you all know very well how loud the wildlife can be in a forest or an open field. You walking on a branch/leaves is nothing in comparison.",nmnxqu

h0d3j4x,"I only like this idea if in Quite Place 3, we see a bunch of these monsters attacking some trees in the forest during a breezy afternoon, violently thrashing in the water trying to end the crashing of waves, and jumping up into the sky helplessly swiping their claws at thunderclaps.",nmnxqu
gzwglfs,Pretty sure it's somewhat of a spinoff of the Beowulf villain and all the tense scenes of people struggling to be quite in movies that has been a thing forever.,nmnxqu

h0idx23,But if all they are is nuts how do they ride asteroids from other planets presumably down to earth 🌎🤔,nmnxqu
h2knl7z,I read somewhere that the idea is they came to earth on an asteroid and lived on that asteroid in space where there is no noise. That’s why they are so sensitive to the noise on earth.,nmnxqu
h3kkjow,"if that is true why they have echo location, lmao, you guys make the silliest arguments for a clear plot hole.

all those clicking your hear is them tracking the source, similar to dolphins or cetaceous.

you can see this very clear when they are running in the factory, its open head and clicking looking for them.",nmnxqu
h3roz78,"Oh really... so what about crickets for example? I guess they just block out 99% of the wildlife completely and just focus on humans making noises? That makes PERFECT sense. Yikes.

I'm just trying to point how how \*loud\* natural wildlife can be in comparison to humans walking around. It's not even close.",nmnxqu
h54tw2p,"They aren't very bright so I doubt they brought themselves there, which makes me think maybe they're pets of another alien species. Then again if it were an asteroid at the beginning maybe they're tag-alongs on a natural 'seeding' event.",nmnxqu
hci7zoa,"They are probably a horde for a greater species to come and invade the earth.

gzr06i6,I’d imagine after a couple years there won’t be many more birds left.,nmnxqu
h064let,"There are other issues like if they hate humans wouldn’t they be able to “see” them with their sonar abilities?  They clearly have a way to navigate the world using sound rather than sight, so you’d think if they maul enough humans they could have a feel for what their bodies sound like in an echolocation sense.",nmnxqu

iammjaj,So almost a Star Ship Trooper type attack?,nmnxqu
gzt5mw2,I mean I’ve thought of something similar but without Thanos. They’re a “scout” party sent to soften up the target(us). Before the main force comes in for the finishing touches.,nmnxqu
h2im9hq,"Really? That's fascinating because one of the big critiques I have is that we are left barely progressed from where we started. In fact, the climax to the sequel was almost entirely the same as the first one. The sound weapon was merely ported to at least one other radio, but ultimately it played out exactly like the first one. We don't get to see any big progress beyond what was expected to happen following the first ending. 

It's weird because it made this movie feel entirely like filler. No character development really, no lore, no real revelations. Felt super low ambition. 

Enjoyable, but weak payoff.",nmnxqu

h1ltog6,I don't think they figured out how to paddle the boat. When Cillian Murphy was in the water that blue boat was in front of him with two creatures on top. One fell into the water while attacking one of the kidnapping men. The other stayed on top of the boat. I'm presuming the boat continued to float towards the island with the creature on it and it landed on shore.,nmnxqu

Hmm, this attack dog theory plays out ok actually.",nmnxqu

absolutely not. most tanks are stong only frontally and almost all of them have weak spots. the belly for example Im pretty sure has very little armor. so does the rear. I dont think these creatures would have any problem tearing the tank engine apart and then proceeding to kill the crew.",nmnxqu

His plan was to look for his mom and see her on her way back. It was daytime when she left and it was night when he left the bunker. Any kid would be super worried in that situation.

There’s the exchange once they get to the island of, “I was wrong about you…”

Sure, you could see it as forced/cliche, but it came off as genuine to me. Felt like a redemption of this character who had clearly lost hope, but was inspired by an encounter from his past.

Were the boats already at the dock? Perhaps they were privately owned boats that the NG took over for loading. I didn’t picture like 12 cruise ships here, he just said boats.

Given the 2/12 success rate, I thought it was the first and last ditch “military”  operation to save people before realizing people can’t shut the f up in a panicked situation and everyone died including the National Guard.

Nottingham (about the Sheriff of Nottingham solving medieval forensic cases) was one of the most heavily-bid ""darling"" screenplays... and when Scott finally got hold of it, he threw everything out and had it rewritten into a bog-standard typical Robin Hood movie.

This is what takes me out of the suspension of disbelief. If sound was their weakness, specifically loud or overwhelming sound, then a bomb blast right next to them WILL send shockwaves to their ears and defeat them. That armor would have to defy the laws of physics where it somehow just absorbs the shockwaves, 100% of it, and I guess you could bring up the earth elements part about the armor but thats just us copping out the writers. It’s just too out of the realm of possibility and you need to really sell yourself on the monsters a lot for it to work.

As for your analogy, these aliens did a damn good job for an invading force.  Did they wipe humanity out?  No.  Did they greatly reduce the potential for large scale casualties? Yes, absolutely.  Huge swathes of the mainlands got wiped out.  The remaining pockets of humanity would be completely unable to mount a defensive against an intelligent force.  And they also made it so that the natural resources of the planet are no longer being consumed at a high rate.

Sending Tigers in against any human population would be worthless.  They might kill a few humans, but they would mostly get shot, stabbed, or starve before inflicting large scale casualties.",nmnxqu

Regarding examples - I didn't really mean the specific ones of course. I just try to grasp what kind / level of problems are you talking about.

Financial and health issues that require loyalty? Sure, I'n here for my close ones and then some not-so-close people I still hold dear.  


But fighting off invaders if it's not just stray thugs? Imagine foreign military for instance? I'm not so sure I have the guts for it and I truly hope to never have to find out.  


Then there's a bunch of things I wouldn't do just because of being awkward as hell - such as risking health and life for property. Nah-huh, this is reserved for living things.

In a similar way, a dog doesn't understand what glass is or why it can't see it.

But static on a tv or an air conditoner fan or rainfall don't bother us despite being a constant noise.

It's the high pitched frequency and the delayed repetetive nature of the alarm that drives us crazy.

The aliens don't attack ANY sound they hear.  They, like any predator, attack sounds that indicate prey.

Just like as a human, hearing leaves crunch as you walk by or see other people doesn't even register to you.

Yet if you were walking alone in the woods and heard leaves crunch nearby, you'd instantly look in that direction and enter a cautionary state in case there's something there that might attack you.

So these aliens can hear a waterfall as a constant and not pay it much mind, especially if they investigated it and felt the water rushing all over them. Like any animal, they can put 2 and 2 together that the noise is just the water falling on them.

But if they hear some leaves crunch and then MOVE in a direction or a gunshot etc, they know ""prey"" is about and they go into hunt mode to kill it.

As I said, I dont think they wanted *all* survivors to reach them, and, tbf, I see legitimate concerns why they wouldnt want that.

For instance, we saw through the boat people that some groups literally went crazy (and even if the people on the island didnt outright know that, Im sure they could guess) Why would you want to outright tell the crazy ones were you are?

And if everybody got to the island, isnt it likely that a group might show up that would basically want to kill off the island people and usurp their safe haven? Not saying the risk isnt there by sending out a cryptic message instead, but it *is* smaller, since less visitors = more of a chance of defending themselves against the bad ones. 

Or even logistics like food, water, electricity, infrastucture. If all the survivors assumed that was the only haven (like Reagan did, remeber she went to that specific island and didnt just try and go to a random one), and even if they all were good people, the island didnt seem that big that it could have hosted everyone, with resources to feed everyone. Sure, you could plant more things, but that takes time and we dont even know if they had planting equipment.

It’s not a rule, just something I’ve noticed. Horror is about things being *wrong*. If the unspoken background things fit together too tightly and too well it becomes difficult to experience it viscerally instead of intellectually.

That’s not a *problem* as such, it just turns it into not-a-horror-movie.",nmnxqu

I.E: I can shake the gate to get their attention and have them come running, but when the wind is shaking it they can't be bothered.

Animals have heightened senses that allow them to distinguish certain sounds from others, and these creatures have super-levels of those senses; pretty sure they can distinguish certain noises from ambient.

Also, they've been on the planet for hundreds of days by the time we see them; I'm sure with their speed and ability to check sounds in a matter of seconds, they've gotten accustomed to what is ambient noise and what isn't on our planet.",nmnxqu

https://screencrush.com/where-do-quiet-places-monsters-come-from/ 

One of the most compelling things about [John Krasinski](https://screencrush.com/tags/john-krasinski/)’s [A Quiet Place ](https://screencrush.com/tags/a-quiet-place/)franchise is its ability to tell a complete story without expositional backstories. We’re thrown into a post-apocalyptic setting that’s become rampant with gruesome killing machines, but we never learn why or how. But Krasinski actually revealed the origin of his monsters on an episode of the [Empire ](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/quiet-place-empire-podcast-spoiler-special-john-krasinski/)podcast. There’s a lot more to them than meets the eye.
First off, Krasinski confirmed that the creatures are indeed extra-terrestrial. “They are absolutely aliens. They’re from another planet,” said Krasinski. “Where I developed the idea of them and what I wanted them to look like was most alien movies are about takeovers, agendas, they’re a thinking alien creature, and for me this idea of a predator, this idea of a parasite, this idea of something that is introduced into an ecosystem [was interesting].""

Krasinski likened the aliens’ takeover to a “terrible” joke he once heard about “releasing wolves into a daycare center.” But these are not just any wolves — they’re evolutionarily perfect machines. “So the idea is if they grew up on a planet that had no humans and no light then they don’t need eyes, they can only hunt by sound,” he explained. “They also develop a way to protect themselves from everything else so that’s why they’re bulletproof and all these things.”
Lastly, Krasinski shared his idea for how these aliens were able to traverse across space to Earth. Since they have no eyes, piloting a spaceship wouldn’t be possible. Their indestructible armor, however, allowed for a new means of transportation. Said Krasinski: “[The armor is] also the reason why they were able to survive kind of the explosion of their planet and then survive on these meteorites, because they’ve evolved to be bulletproof. Until they open themselves up to be vulnerable, they’re completely invulnerable.”

h549oq5,"> My guess is that their metabolism is extremely efficient and maybe they only need to eat once or twice in their lifetime

It may be that they survive space primarily by hibernating.

They may also not recognize humans as food. They don't have eyes and they *seem* to navigate via echolocation and brute force. Maybe they have some kind of organ that senses things they can eat and humans don't trigger that sense, which is why they can only find humans by sound.",nmnxqu

h0jx9i0,I agree with this train of thought. From an evolutionary point of view they're probably just animals doing animal things.

gzud6j1,"Yes, because we as humans have lived on earth for thousands and thousands and thousands of years and know how to specifically hunt animals. These aliens show up and know instantly in a day that cell phones, doors creaking, and cop sirens are all active noise but a waterfall isn't? And how are birds even still alive? 

Something being wrong is entirely different from something not making sense. The VVitch is a wonderful example of something being wrong but everything making perfect sense, that's not horror to you? There are plenty of visceral horror movies that make sense. 

I can suspend my disbelief fine, but when a movie sets up specific rules and doesn't follow them it detracts from my ability to experience it viscerally. A movie not making sense makes it an intellectual experience instead of a visceral because you're stuck analyzing and looking for explanations",nmnxqu
gzvz1bu,"Actually read the thread. It doesn't make sense that only active noise bothers them and not background. 

Also your dogs are creatures that have been on the earth for centuries. On top of that your dogs know it is you because of smell, timing, and repetition, it's not just sound and they didn't know the first time you did it. 

Finally the monsters knew to attack very specific sounds on their very first day if you watched the first 20 minutes of the movie.",nmnxqu
gzx7rz1,That doesn’t make sense. And your dog isn’t a alien lmao the dog would still come to the room where it’s food dish is if it falls off a shelf because it’s conditioned to that sound. The first movie there’s raccoons outside making noise yet the aliens don’t go after them which makes no sense. If birds can fly they certainly wouldn’t be extinct in a matter of days. That’s lazy writing. If wind makes a door creak the same way it does when a human opens it then these aliens can’t differentiate ambient sounds lol as if they have this made up ability to choose “hey that sounds like a living organism I better go check that out” from “hey that water splashing has to be a living thing”,nmnxqu
h0uebi6,Every bird and goose I've seen yelling at the top of their lungs have done it from either the ground or a tree.

You stating there is no sizeable military left in the world is an assumption. If you're unfamiliar with the definition of the word 'assumption' (although I can't imagine this is the case since you are clearly of higher intellect and I am a simple minded American) let me refresh you:

""a thing that is accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof.""

You have no proof there is no sizeable militaries left. It is neither shown nor stated in either movie. Therefore it's an assumption on your part...

As for the act of making assumptions, I don't understand where you get this notion that people aren't allowed to make assumptions. Do you only make decisions or form opinions once you understand something in its totality? Everyday, people go about their lives and make choices based on their assumption of what the outcome will be. 

As for people's reasonable assumption that the military would at least try using sonic weapons:

1. In the first movie, a news paper clipping states ""its sound!"", explaining that at some point during the course of this invasion, people were able to write, publish, print, and deliver these newspapers 
2. With the above, it's reasonable to assume that at some point, the military would also understand the creatures are extremely sensitive to sound....

Just the prologue of part II shows that even with how far away the meteor was, the creatures fell off it and then managed to run to the town and destroy it within minutes. There is no way the military could properly fight back against creatures that probably ravaged the country within hours if not days. But that's just what I think",nmnxqu
