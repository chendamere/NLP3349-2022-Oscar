db9go2l,The part when Chiron asks Juan if he sells drugs and if he sold to his mother really got to me. Never have I seen such shame on a man's face as I did on Juan when he admitted to doing so. Truly great ensemble cast. ,5exe5g
dafxdrb,"Props to all three of the actors who played Chiron. You'd think the movie was following one person throughout his life ala Boyhood, they complimented each other so well.",5exe5g
daich33,That shot close to the beginning with the camera circling around Juan and the other drug dealer through their whole conversation blew me away.,5exe5g
dao6mud,"This may have been said already, but the one thing that stood out most to me with this movie is the way it handled the world. The way that these events are so small and to others would just have been another day. When Chiron gets lunch and dinner from Juan, when Kevin tells him that story of having sex in the staircase, to the second to last scene when Chiron is nestled in Kevin's neck. These moments are so modernist that it may seem cliche but I think it's saying something. That the tiny parts of our lives are so important to who we are and become. And yes other movies emphasize this notion but they have to emphasize them, Moonlight let it happen, it showed what needed to be showed and nothing else. no frills. A truly masterful film. ",5exe5g
dafyp7f,"Not just the best movie I've seen this year, but probably the best I've seen in *years*.

One of Roger Ebert's most famous quotes:

> We all are born with a certain package. We are who we are: where we were born, who we were born as, how we were raised. We're kind of stuck inside that person, and the purpose of civilization and growth is to be able to reach out and empathize a little bit with other people. And for me, the movies are like a machine that generates empathy. It lets you understand a little bit more about different hopes, aspirations, dreams and fears. It helps us to identify with the people who are sharing this journey with us.

This movie is *exactly* what he was talking about.",5exe5g
dail5e1,"A lot of people talking about how this is a very touching and important movie of gay people. I deinfinitly agree. I think it was a perfect choice for this film because of how negatively homosexuality has been viewed in the past. Especially in relation to masculinity.

But I found the movie to be very easy to relate to as a heterosexual man as well. The idea of having difficulty opening yourself up to others isn't specific to any one sexualtiy. Of course I understand that being heterosexual is still more commonly seen as normal where as being gay is sometimes still viewed as abnormal, so it was a great choice for the story the movie was trying to tell.

I guess I'm trying to say that the movie was much deeper then just, how do I come to terms with being a gay man?",5exe5g
daol0es,"Did anyone find it interesting that even though Chiron was sent to Atlanta, the black gay capital of the world, he didn't have any relationships or sex with any other men?

dako3pd,"Did anyone else notice the use of ""Every Nigger is a Star"" by Boris Gardiner as the intro to the movie as an allusion to *To Pimp a Butterfly* by Kendrick Lamar? They both are about the negative effects of the community surrounding a main character, so I thought the parallel was intentional.

Also, the use of the song ""Classic Man"" I thought was a nod at how Chiron pretends to be a ""classic"" man (meaning straight) yet it's all a front. ",5exe5g
dafvo4a,"It's immediately clear that the character in the third act is *not* Chiron. That's not who he is. It's not just the muscles and the grill, either, which are clearly a costume for his insecurity. It's also the scene where he fucks with the guy who was pushing drugs for him in that super-douchey, masculine way. He thinks that this is how he has to act, how he has to treat others, and how he has to be in order to be accepted/be a man. It's almost like he has no choice.

In terms of nature vs nurture, it's very clear that the Chiron in the third act (until the end) is a product of nurture. That's the saddest part of the film to me, him feeling like he has to be someone he's very clearly not because of nothing other than the environment he was happened to be born into.",5exe5g
dcu28e4,As a straight white guy who is looking for love this movie destroyed me.  I was reminded of the fact that were all human.  We all want the same things in life.  We all want to be who we are without having to put up some facade.  The last scene had me bawling my eyes out.  I was so happy for both of them.  I've never had a movie affect me like this.  We all want to be who we are and to be loved for it.  What an absolutely beautiful film.  I really feel that this movie was robbed at the Golden Globes.  While La La land is a nice film the emotion Moonlight invokes isn't comparable.,5exe5g
dafvjsj,"What a great movie. Trevante was my roommate in Austin back in 2012 when I first started at UT. He was a nice guy, I think I helped him with an audition tape once when I was first getting my footing as a filmmaker. He left around December to LA and I am happy he found success! 

Also I had his couches for awhile, which was nice. ",5exe5g
dafuljk,"
This film is a masterpiece in my opinion, It’s a lot more surreal than I was expecting, very slow paced with this dreamlike tone. All three versions of the protagonist are incredible and overall the film features some of the best acting of the year. t I love the way the director films black skin. It feels so luminous and beautiful. The film has gorgeous lighting, with fantastic uses of the colors blue and purple. I was especially surprised with the music. It has a ton of variety and every song choice is just dead on perfect. This is one of those films that just envelopes you in its style but has such a deep heart that it never feels overly stylish. It’s too bad pretty much all the acting besides Naomi Harris and maybe Marshella Ali will get ignored, only because there’s so many small but powerful performances because of the way it was structured. Also how perfect was the naming of the three time periods and the way his identity changed through each. 

Two sidenotes. One, it wasn't till after I saw the film that I understood how well done [the poster is.](http://www.blackfilm.com/read/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Moonlight-poster.jpg) Two, I find it interesting that both this film and To Pimp a Butterfly start with the song [""Every Nigger is a Star"" by Boris Gardiner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYnenIWZjwE). Guess if something starts with that song you know you are in for quality.  ",5exe5g
daipjm2,"just saw this last night, and I've gotta say this is without a doubt one of the best films I've ever seen--just added it to my letterboxd top 4, in fact. the shot where his mother is screaming at him while the audio is muted was absolutely gorgeous; it keeps coming back to me. and the score! god the score was amazing. honestly, every part of it was fantastic--acting, cinematography, score, script, all of it. 

I have a good feeling that this will do very well at the oscars. one thing I loved about it was that it wasn't just a movie about being gay--it touched on finding out who you are, not fitting in, fraught family structures, toxic masculinity, the war on drugs, etc. even my 55 year old dad told me afterwards that he could relate to aspects of the film because, like chiron, he was bullied a lot in school (albeit for different reasons). I think you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who would not enjoy this film. ",5exe5g
dba88so,"When Chiron says,""I cry so much sometimes I think one day I’m gone just turn into drops"" on the beach was the most sad part of the movie to me and I'm not even sure why... even just thinking about it makes me sad.

ddybmt7,"Amazing film. I love how when Chiron is an adult you can see him revert to his personality as youth when he encounters certain situations and people. The shell he has placed over himself both physically and with his hard bravado gives way and you can see deep down he is still that anxious, uncertain, and lonely little boy.   ",5exe5g

dafuuhe,"Naomie Harris knocked it out of the park as Chiron's mom. I really really hope she gets a Lead Actress or Supporting Actress nomination for this movie.

I think an interesting double feature would be to watch *Moonlight* and another 2016 release, *The Handmaiden*, back to back. They both explore homosexual relationships occurring in societies where it's not encouraged (if not utterly demonized)!",5exe5g

dcme98o,"So I didn't see this mentioned, maybe someone did, but I thought it was interesting the choice of game the kids all played in the giant field in the first act. Where I grew up in Texas, not sure how it was anywhere else, that game used to be called ""Smear The Queer"". The rules were: whoever picked the ball up was labeled the Queer and everybody else chased them and tackled them. We see Chiron never pick up the ball. I'm not sure if it was a coincidence or if it was another subtle theme placed by the Director.",5exe5g
dagaer6,"Saw it for a second time this week. It's a modern classic and I highly recommend anyone who enjoyed this to check out Tarrell Alvin McCreary's plays. 

I saw it at a festival and some interesting notes from the Q&A with Jenkins/McCreary/Harris/Holland.

- Harris had visa issues and shot all her scenes in under 72 hours.

- Both Jenkins and McCreary had crackhead mothers.

- Rhodes, Hibbert, and Sanders were cast with only their eyes in mind for continuity. Jenkins thought that was most important for Chiron. Kevin was cast based on similar looks.

-  In the final scene between Chiron and Paula, the scene was supposed to end on Chiron saying ""I hate you, momma,"" but Naomie Harris couldn't light her cigarette so Rhodes improvised the rest of the scene.",5exe5g
dasj2du,"I have a feeling this and fences is going to produce some oscar winners for performances, even leading to mostly black actors winning the oscar for acting.

It makes me sad that certain trolls will criticise this saying that the oscars are just trying to overly justify for last year. Which is a real shame because the performances by Viola Davis and 90% of this cast deserve the awards very justifiably. ",5exe5g
dc963wy,"A little late, but there was a thought I had about this that I really wanted to share.  I think what really struck me about this film, is all of the actors and directors understood the power of silence.  So many films the dialogue goes so quickly, that 'quiet'/slow scenes seem to take ages.  I felt like in Moonlight, it gives you time to process alongside the characters, which really helps you to feel connected to the story.",5exe5g
dam1g7g,"Just saw this last night and have to say it could have been the worst theater going experience I have ever had. Don't get me wrong, I was floored by this movie. Its incredible. But the other members of the audience were so disrespectful. Both scenes involving homosexual relations (whether it was implied or showed it) was met with snide comments, people bursting out into laughter, and walk outs. I lost a little faith in humanity last night.",5exe5g
dcl67lx,"I feel like a very common criticism is people saying things about the third act and how it was 'missing' things. I love that this movie was focused on a more specific story (Chirons sexuality) and didn't spend time showing us how Juan died, or how shitty it was for him in Juvie in Atlanta. We don't need to see those things. Chiron says he hasn't had relations with anybody since he did with Kevin, so the movie stays on that thread. I thought it was extremely well done. ",5exe5g
deiwh6s,"I watched this movie last night in Taiwan. I am not American. By the end of the movie, I was drained from all the things all the characters had to go through. In mainstream American media, many people talked about how black people in America couldn't get out of the hood, the sentiment is amplified by the Black Lives Matter movement. After watching this movie I finally understood what that meant. 

Restraint is a common theme in every act, every scene in Moonlight. The moment a character lets loose and try to do what they want, everything goes wrong. Juan talked about the old lady told him that at a certain point they have to choose what they have to be -- but in the end, did they choose based on what they want in their heart, or their environment closed the doors and forced them to choose the few roads they don't want to? A bullying incident went wrong destroyed the lives of every party involved. When the teacher was coaxing Chiron to press charges against the boys who bullied him, he knew that if he did it would destroy Kevin's life. He chose to remain silent. But his own rage took over him, and he made that one mistake. 

All it takes is one mistake, one wrong decision, and the paths ahead of them changed forever. Is society that unforgiving to black people? How did it become that way? Should it be that way? How do we change that today? 

The movie presented three snapshots of Chiron's life. The movie did not need to show us every scene, but just through the dialogue alone, we could feel the gravity of the moment and picture what happened in between, flashing through in our minds just like how the characters were experiencing it at that moment, which made it even more powerful. The only time Chiron was happy, when he felt that someone was there for him, was when Juan taught him to swim. Chiron had a father figure -- albeit for a brief moment before he was betrayed. Theresa was more of a mother for him than his own mother Paula, who was battling with addiction. /r/raisedbynarcissists would have a lot to say about Paula. But even Theresa was aware of her awkward identity, being the wife of the man who sold drugs to Chiron's mother. Chiron's relationship with Kevin is one that is universal -- such a simple love for one another, but because of the social norms placed on them, they couldn't express those feelings, or rather they don't know how to, even until the end of the movie. 

Movies exploring black culture,  masculinity, sexuality, drug abuse, family, relationships are dime a dozen, but Moonlight weaved them together in such a poetic manner, it's beautiful yet so heart-wrenching at the same time. To me, this movie is great because every single character felt real, even though such a movie had not been attempted before in cinemas, let alone winning Oscars.  

Other commenters here mentioned the last scene was absolutely beautiful, and I agree wholeheartedly. After almost everyone around him who he trusted turned against him, Chiron finally opened up to someone to trust again, even just for a moment. Kevin showed him that there's a life outside of the hood, the hustling, albeit a simple one, he is *free*. Perhaps Kevin would be Chiron's salvation, and let him live the life where he could be Little again, free to bask in the moonlight and be beautiful and blue.",5exe5g
dahccaj,"I don't see many people here talking about it, but one of the best directed scenes in the film was when Young Chiron and Young Kevin were fighting. You know they're just fighting, but there's still a strong undertone of this being the path to Chiron realizing his sexuality. ",5exe5g
dag84ta,"The 3 best moments of the film

dakqe1g,I noticed after seeing the film that the poster is literally all three of the actors merged into one face. I thought it was just Black but you can see the color themes for Shiron and Little as well. I really loved the sense of emptiness that the film had at certain points where there were almost voids of sound and it left a lot of interpretation up to me as the viewer.,5exe5g
dat7bz9,"This movie is very important to me. It opened my eyes to see things as they are for what has pretty much been staring me in the face all this time. I hope that because of this movie we finally get to see an issue be talked about that I haven't really seen many people discussing, which of course is, how fine Janelle Monae is..... In all seriousness though this was a great movie that I'm still thinking about after a week which is rare to me these days. 25% of those thoughts are about Janelle Monae though....",5exe5g
ddu3xl7,"As a mid 20's gay (closeted) black male, this movie hits me where it hurts. I've repressed myself for as long as I can remember, having to put up fronts and 'be hard' is no way to live. Beautifully acted! The cast did an amazing job. The scene that stood out to me the most is when we see Chiron dancing in class. That was one small moment where he truly was himself and genuinely seemed happy.",5exe5g
dahevdf,"Did people laugh throughout anyone else's showing? My theater was packed and you would have thought we were watching a comedy. I thought some parts were funny. But I was a little disappointed when everyone would laugh at scenes that, had the film starred a heterosexual man, probably would have garnered no laughter at all. I think people felt uncomfortable? I don't know. Saw it with my dad and he was puzzled by the laughter as well.",5exe5g
dezqzt6,"I love the final scene where Kevin and Chiron are holding each other and it cuts to Little standing on the beach at night, facing away from the camera at the ocean, bathed in moonlight. And then he turns and looks up at the moon. It's a reference to the scene where Juan and him go swimming and Juan talks about how he got his nickname ""blue"" from a lady who saw him in the moonlight and he says ""at some point you gotta decide for yourself who you wanna be. You can't let nobody make that decision for you.""

The moonlight plays as a metaphor for what people see in others and how they define others by it. Little, the child inside Chiron, finally sees the moon. It is the internal representation of when Black and Kevin embrace in the final scene. It is as if to say the external depiction, the false identity is recognized and thus rendered useless in this final act of love. Black becomes who he is, rather than letting his identity define him like he has for so long, even since he was Little.

I also find it interesting that in astrology, Chiron is a sign representative of ""the wounded healer"" who, in mythology could not heal himself. That Chiron needs such closure with Kevin is a sign that he needed Kevin to help heal him. Also, in the symbol for Chiron, there's a 'K' attached to an 'O'. The symbolism is abundant.",5exe5g
dagirs1,"The third act was lesser than the first two, but still it's comparing a 9/10 act to 2 10/10's. Movie of the year hands down",5exe5g
damv0nh,"I really wanted to like this film more than I did, but I couldn't get into it like I wanted. Don't get me wrong, this is still one of the best films I've seen this year (I'd put it slightly behind Arrival & HoHW), but I couldn't get as emotionally invested as I wanted. Maybe it's because the giant skips in time made character development a little tricky, or because I felt like the most dimensional character was Juan, and not Chiron. They gave Chiron a bunch of events to define him, instead of actually building a character behind those events. Essentially, I'm very reactive to films typically, and this movie didn't make me feel as much as I expected. I felt bad for Chiron like I would an injured person on the news. I didn't feel terribly acquainted with him. I'm sure I'm in the minority on this, but those are my thoughts. And to add, I thought the third act was incredible. I struggled up until then, and then with the lack of support for it.",5exe5g
dfjkb4a,"Masterpiece.

A beautiful coming of age movie and a potent deconstruction of masculinity.  Perfectly directed and acted that you literally feel every moment and so layered and involved with it's characters that it seems lived in. Every so often something comes along that meditates on identity and really unveils a deeper understanding of what it is to be human. This is one of those movies.",5exe5g
dafws7h,"This film is definitely not what I expected it to be. I went in prepared for an interesting narrative and gained so much more. Its a surreal, at times dream like, story, that is visually highly stylized. For example much of the shots are shot in very shallow depth of focus, the lighting is very vibrant and colorful. 

What stood out the most were the shots of the individual characters in close ups, of which their are many. Just the way the faces were framed was very interesting, the camera work in general was the best I have seen all year. 

The ending is not predictable and leaves the audience wondering, thinking and guessing. Will watch it a second time to really enjoy it. 

EDIT: I might add that the editing of this film is fantastic. Oftentimes we stay longer than usual on shots of individuals, which really lets the audience process the emotions of the scenes. 

The style of the film in general reminded me slightly of Malik-esque",5exe5g

I'm not gay, and I'm not black, but I can genuinely say I fully understand how Black feels *at every moment in this movie*, from first hand experience.

My favorite film of the year. My favorite film for a long time.",5exe5g
dduq4k2,"I have a thought on the third part. I think Chiron became a drug dealer because he looked up to Juan (Mahershala Ali's character) Juan was the closest to a father figure he ever had and the only decent person he had met during his youth (along with Teresa) But what convinces me the most about this is the scene where Chiron asks him if he's a drug dealer and if his mother did drugs to which he answers with the truth. He chose to be a decent human being to Chiron even if it meant Chiron would think he was a scumbag, and that's everything Chiron really needed during that time of his life.

I love this movie because it's full of stuff like this, it suggests without telling. It lets you know just what you need and then lets everything out for you to discern. Some of its scenes are all built with images rather than with words; in fact, it has very little dialogue. This is a true achievement of filmmaking and is what I wish for future films to be. 

Yeah, I know ""DAE TELLING THROUGH CINEMATOGRAPHY"" is nothing new, but this movie does it splendidly. And along with the visuals, the acting, the music, the directing, and such which were all also amazingly done this film doesn't fall short from great.

He deserves it so much. 

One thing that I loved about this film was how he humanized the characters. Juan wasn't just a drug dealer; Chiron's mom wasn't just an addict; Jenkins gave them so many layers to show that there's more to someone than meets the eye. Incredibly smart and well done. ",5exe5g

Little is pretty much every gay boy growing up not knowing what gay is but being constantly bellitled because of it. Juan is exceptionally kind to him and a father figure. I feel like teen Chiron beat the bully to such extreme because of his love for Kevin.  In that environment black was who he had to become, that or a victim to the drugs like his mom. I actually loved that they didn't have intercourse at the end the intimacy was more resounding and I like that black wasn't killed, often in gay films the end is homicide or suicide so really appreciated the ending.

If you had told me this was a Boyhood type movie and those were the same guy playing the character in all three acts, I could believe you.

Almost teared up at the scene where Chiron and his mom were crying at the rehab center too. Naomie Harris hit it out of the park with her role as well.

Definitely plan on buying this once it comes out and while I was hoping to see more of Mahershala Ali in the movie, I felt like he filled his role perfectly.

ddotuba,"My father has this theory -- He believes that Chiron isn't homosexual whatsoever. He believes that from a young age, people called him a faggot (e.g. The scene where he asks Juan what a faggot is), and throughout the movie, we see that up until high school, until he finally snapped, he was called a faggot again and again and due to his weakness and innocence, he started believing it himself. 

After he went to juvi, he turned into Juan, his mentor. He got the grills, the muscles, the car and the money. He turned into a badass.  Nobody even came close to him because he got respect. He made a name for himself and everybody feared him (unlike his high school and earlier years). When he went to visit Kevin, he told him that ""no man has ever touched me"" outside of Kevin. It doesn't necessarily show that he's not a homosexual, but it does make you think -- what if he isn't a homosexual? What if genuinely doesn't feel attraction for men, but due to his past life experiences, he is forced to believe that he is? 

Just something to think about. ",5exe5g

Sure he went to prison, sure he's a drug dealer but he's still Chiron. A shy dude who also happens to be gay in a vein of society where being gay is probably not something you want people to know about you. To see him get some human touch at the end made my feel happy, but also melancholy. I can only imagine how alone he must have felt for so long. I just wonder if anything came of him and Kevin or if he retreated back into himself and left it at that. The final shot of him at the beach as a little kid, going back to one of the only other times he was ever happy and loved. The only good memory he revisited in the whole movie.

The whole story is completely centered on Chiron and only covers a few other people and it's played out on a very minimal scale, yet Chiron is a mystery throughout the whole film.

I think Moonlight, O.J.

Regardless of what some may have you believe, 2016 has been a great year for cinema.

For those who loved Moonlight, I highly recommend you seek out Jenkins previous film Medicine for Melancholy (discussed it on our podcast a few weeks back: http://www.modernsuperior.com/podcasts/changing-reels-episode-6-medicine-melancholy/).

Also, the relationship between Kevin and Chiron was interesting. Even in high school, Kevin seemed to overcompensate when describing his sexual conquests to Chiron. If other kids had targeted Chiron as being gay, Kevin had to have known or seen that too.

I didn't enjoy it though, but I'm not sure I'm meant to. It raised many questions for me and exposed me to lifestyles and experiences which I would not have considered previously. I did find it very slow-moving, overplaying on silence to convey emotion, but simultaneously detaching me further from the characters. Coming from a culture and having life experiences so different to what was shown in the film made it (personally) a bit of a struggle to connect with Chiron. I did also massively struggle with Boyhood, so perhaps it's not a large surprise that I wasn't totally able to here as well.

deutuyj,"Watched it tonight. Wow. 

First impression as the film ended? I felt absolution. Like I've been made whole and born again. And yeah, I feel this way because the 3rd part of the movie was all about forgiveness. 

For me, the strength of the film was in its tone, especially the strong use of colour (sometimes even blatant lmao). The two key characters in Chiron's life, Kevin and his mom (the two people he dreams about), wear blue in most of the film. Chiron himself never directly wears blue, but he's often showed bathed in a blue glow -- whether it be in the kitchen of one of his dealers, or from neon signs outside Kevin's diner.

I can see why people would think it's a boring film though. The climax had already gone before I realised it -- the chair smash scene. But for me that just kind of adds to its realistic pace -- it's not out to tell a story, but to show a life. Same thing with that final scene where kevin just holds him -- somehow i think having a Big Gay Sex scene just wouldn't sit in with the pace of the film, and I kind of like the mellowness of the open end.

As for the acting? oodles of kudos to teen chiron, awkward puberty is all gangly limbs and acne.

Beyond homosexuality, this is also a very good movie to put bromance on the table. As a straight dude with excellent friends I can definitely feel how hard it is to open up. Sometimes friendship gets really close to love. Even when you know deep down that you're not homosexual, there's some pressure to keep the bromance level to a minimum.

de9xamq,"I really enjoyed this film, but something about it just left me underwhelmed at the end. First and second act are absolutely masterful. I agree. But I think when you deprive the audience from dialogue, especially with your main character, you want to see his arc reached by actually speaking. 

For him to simply say (and being the last line in the film), 'you're the only man who has ever touched me'. I just found that statement hard to believe especially going in prison looking as weak as he did in the second act. 

The two characters needed to reevaluate the bullying scene instead of speaking with their eyes. These ain't shy kids no more, they're grown men. They've had lives spent going through prison and the other raising a family. That scene has forced Chiron to 'build himself from the ground up' so he's definitely been carrying the baggage along for too long to simply just 'try to forget about it'. This guy is a gangsta now. He carries a gun during drug deals and intimidates his friends. Kevin has to be confronted not by infatuation but through the 'false' masculinity Chiron exhibits. 

Let's say this; if Kevin asked him in the kitchen again why he came down to Miami, and if Chiron had said he actually planned to beat him up for what he did. The silence from something like that would have drawn a more stronger ending. The procrastination to forgive Kevin would be the ultimate acceptance of his identity which is the main issue of the film. That would make the question of 'who is you, Chiron' way more powerful. 

Just my two cents. 8 out of 10. ",5exe5g

dee2jmo,"I just saw Moonlight and it really hit home something I hadn't really considered before. I'm a white gay man, and I know I was pretty lucky growing up... But for the longest time, and even today, I still have this pre-conceived notion tied up in my head that my sexuality makes me 'less than' a straight person. I was never maliciously victimised like Chiron was, just some gentle teasing, but I still had all these ideas pent up (from movies, TV, from hearing my parents talk and hearing other kids joke) about what a gay person should and could be, and it limited the way I conducted myself. I'd avoid saying things, I'd avoid showing my emotions, I'd purposely show no interest in things that could be seen as 'stereotypical' because it might signify my sexuality to someone else, that would diminish my worth. And that fucking sucks. 

But I see a lot of people saying they didn't relate to Chiron, and I genuinely think - surely this sort of feeling, the pressure to conform to what is expected, effects everyone in some way? We're becoming more and more progressive but there are still ideas that guys should be 'stoic' and emotionless, that women should always be caring and giving and selfless, that certain races are expected to be a certain way or similarly should NEVER be seen to give in to a stereotype. I see Moonlight as a beautiful realist slice of life story, a really heartbreaking and aching romance, but moreover a fascinating look into identity. We're all shaped, in some way, by what society expects us to be and not be, and sometimes that can really fuck us up and tear us apart.

dawrsi6,"I think the reactions to Moonlight have a parallel to Boyhood.

When I watched Boyhood, I was moved to tears near the end, something that never happens for me in movies. The feeling was unexpected and hard to describe. Only after the movie was I able to deconstruct it's power. Meanwhile, a number of people I talked to who appreciated film sort of thought the movie was a pretty good, well-acted movie with charm, but without the resonance.

With Moonlight, I thought it was a great piece constructed with love and well acted performances, but I'm not having that powerful, from-the-heart swelling of emotion that I got with Boyhood.

I think the reason is because I am a late 20s male raised in middle class suburbia, and while every aspect isn't parallel (I'm not white or American), the core experiences of the boy in Boyhood resonated in a very deep place for me. I didn't even realize how closely I was drawn into the characters. It was effortless for me despite the lack of a typically compelling narrative arc or dramatic scenes.

If you grew up poor, black, gay, or a combination of those things, I'd imagine this film taps into a wellspring of emotion in the same way that Boyhood did for me. In that respect, it's a landmark achievement. This is the unique nature of such personal films. I almost wish I had the ability to empathize more with the characters from an emotional rather than intellectual perspective.",5exe5g

dea9b1k,"        *THIS POST HAS A TON OF SPOILERS JUST A HEADS UP!

      For those of you commenting on the fact that Moonlight shouldn't have won best picture missed the bus. I personally did not enjoy the movie. I thought it was a decent movie nothing great or extremely special but let me explain to you why it deserves the win.            

           Although the movie does make connections to the gay/trans community, it also makes a nod at the hardships children face in a broken home the analysis of the movie at that level is extremely superficial. What the movie is really about is the loss of innocence in a child and that all humans want the same thing. They want to be loved. 
           That scene where they are on the beach was one of the few times Chiron felt like he was loved. The next scene where that same guy beats him up slaps that one bit of happiness right out of his hand. 
              The same is true of his mother. Mothers are supposed to love there children and be there for them but Paula was so busy with her own problems that she neglected him and he didn't get any love from her either. They only place he truly felt like he had some love was with Juan and this is also why he ended up becoming  a drug dealer like Juan is cause that is what he saw. 
           Notice how even though the movie takes place in a primarily urban setting with mostly African American characters yet the score doesn't have a single hip-hop or rap song on it. Instead Barry Jenkins goes with classical music. Ask yourself why he does this. It's because classical music identifies with the human condition better then any other type of music with lyrics would've done. Humans from any caste or creed or gender or ethnicity we are all looking for the same thing and that is to be loved. That is what moonlight is about and it does a excellent job of portraying that concept.  ",5exe5g

dage39a,"I saw this movie last night and I'm still shaken by it. I tend to be a bit of an emotional android, and overly aware that what I'm watching is just a movie. It's tough for movies get get strong emotional responses out of me, but this one sure did. Maybe it's because the story lands too close to home for me. While I'm not gay or black, this is the closest I've been to seeing my life put on screen in front of me. So many aspects of Chiron's life parallel mine, down to he drug-ridden neighborhood, derelict mother, vicious bullying, and breaking bad. The scene where the woman tells him if he were a man there would be four other knuckleheads there with him put me as near to tears as I've been in a decade. I heard some version of that comment so. many. times. It breaks you because it's justifying others being a piece of shit because you are not one yourself. If only you would be less than who you are, the wold would accept you--soul crushing. I'm a bit tied up in this movie, so I'm probably biased. That ceded, It's the movie of the year IMO and possibly the decade. 

I love how it's shot. There is a visually interesting cyclical pan they use a couple of times that seems like a take on the linear pan used in films like Birdman and  Revenant. It's less gimmicky and helps to focus the environment on the people in it.

There is this great mix of earthy grit mixed in with beautiful shots like the neon room scene. That was especially powerful given the darkness of the moment.

Casting/Acting is great. The three actors that portray Chiron all draw you in with their broken humanity. Trvante Rhodes is able to overlay brokenness with a sort of ''fuck it"" hardness. 

Any flaws are nitpicks, but here they are.

Janelle Monae. Everyone else is hyper realistic and low key except for her looking like a Hollywood dime. She stuck out a bit.

Juan's death felt like a huge missed opportunity. He dies between chapters and they only mention it once, indirectly. There was a lot of emotional investment there that was lost, but the film glosses over it. 

I had a bit of an issue with Juan's role in the film too. This is the story the film chose to tell me, and it's not impossible or anything, so I'll take it at face value, but I've never met any benevolent drug kingpins. My mind was in a dark place when he started to mentor Chiron. I've seen hustlers take kids under their wing, and it's always to get them into the game. I suppose that is inadvertently what happened, but his motivations were a bit idealistically pure.

I liked it quite a lot, though. It seemed like it was an hour longer than it actually was, but in a good way, it managed to make what is a heavily dialogue-driven narrative really interesting. Really solid in every aspect, really.

I had a major brain-fart once it entered it's 2/3 of the film, titled ""Chiron"" and I was thinking of [""Ky-run""](http://www.greekmythology.com/images/mythology/chiron_529.jpg) and didn't realize it was supposed to be the main characters' name ""Shy-rone"" until a few minutes later.",5exe5g
dagne6b,"I liked the movie quite a bit, but I also wasn't as crazy about it as most of the people on here. There were moments throughout that were brilliant and moving, but I also thought that a lot of it was a little too rote and predictable. Particularly in the second segment, everything from the relationship with his friend to the bullying to the friend being pressured to turn on him are all exactly what you would expect in a movie about a gay, black teenager. You could say that's because the real-life experience of a gay, black teenager is often like that, but it felt a little bit too much like ""Precious: The Gay, Black Teenager Edition"" to me. There was nothing in the second part of the film that was unexpected, or challenging, or even that interesting.

I see a lot of people dislike the third segment in comparison to the rest, but that was probably my favourite part of the film, as I thought it took the movie in a more interesting and less conventional direction. It did so in a way that felt completely organic too, as you could see all the experiences from Chyron's childhood that shaped him and pushed him along that path. At first, you're shocked by the complete change in his look and appearance, but then all these prior moments from his childhood (Juan, the bullying, his mother's drug addiction) come back to mind and explain exactly why and how Chiron was pushed down this path. You can see that all the film, all of his childhood, was building up to this, forming him into this caricature of what a black man should be. Its the third part of the film that's also the saddest too - seeing Chiron playing a role, finally succeeding in life by rejecting everything about him. There's also the tension between his real self and his new persona, not knowing which side he's going to fall back to when dealing with Kevin. And the movie ends on an incredibly mature, quiet note, not needing to have some overwrought or cliche moment where everything is wrapped up neatly for Chiron. Its the third part of the film that elevates the rest of the film, in my opinion - without it, it would really just be another Precious (albeit still much better than that piece of crap). ",5exe5g

I thought he was just lonely and consequently somewhat attracted to his close friend. As a gay man who had exclusively female friends in high school, i can say i've been there. I've been attracted to my female friends even though I'm not straight or even bisexual. When Chiron told his friend ""you're the only man who ever touched me"", i was like yup, i can say the same thing, except gender-swapped, to one of my close female friends, and here's the surprising part: it happened after i stopped being confused about my sexuality and knew that i was gay. I say if Chiron really was gay, the writer and director didn't know how to show it, just like with the character Le Fou in Beauty and the Beast. Attention, Hollywood, these people are not gay.

I understand as a black guy its virtually impossible to come out as gay, and it was disheartening to see him conform to his environment, and the guy that raised him. And the whole situation with his mom was wild. Especially the confrontation between Juan and his mom in the car smoking. 

Overall it hit all the right notes, and its a glimpse into a perspective we dont see movies tackle often, but the impact for me wasnt lasting. Maybe because I cant identify with a lot of it, although Im aware that these things happen. Have gay friends, but not black and gay.

Others may have seen sokething entirely different.

That being said....it was really hard for me that the movie stopped right in the spot where a more plot driven film may have shown a character arc. This was his momement of reckoning. Would he make it to the other side? I guess we just didn't get to see. It is driving me CRAZY!",5exe5g

The acting is great, but I still came away feeling like the characters lacked depth.  They almost felt like stereotypes--the reticent boy, the drug-addicted mother, the conflicted drug dealer, the generic nice wife.

danzvc2,"EDIT: This message is for a deleted comment that was at the top.

Okay well since it seems like people are only downvoting you without answering, I'll answer.

I think the popularity of SJW movement helped get this movie made; *however* it is not a commercial for the SJW movement. It's extremely character driven and for that reason, for its specificity, it did not feel preachy, since most of the time preachiness comes in the form of broad idea(s).

Would we be fawning over this movie if the main character wasn't black or gay? No, probably not as much, but that's simply because we've seen this story a hundred times before where the main character is white and straight (they come from a rough neighbourhood, go through puberty, etc.) It's the fact that less light has been shed on a character like this that it's making headlines. Not to mention it's just a very well-told, well-shot, well-acted movie.

With all this said, you (possibly rightfully, based on the downvotes) seem pretty defensive. My advice to you would be 1) See the movie, and 2) Before seeing the movie, try to leave this defensive mindset behind. If you go into the movie thinking you're not gonna like it, but you want to see it so you can back up your hatred, you're not going to like it.

dexry6i,"I love this movie, but I read a stupid review that made a good point... The ending's kind of fucked up. Chiron's friend totally dicked him over. And then he goes back to him. That's... Nice...?",5exe5g
dam1j9r,"I heard some good stuff about this movie from friends and from some public radio podcasts so I went to see it last weekend.  Stylistically it reminded me a *lot* of Paul Thomas Anderson.  It's ambitious and quite beautiful.  There's some excellent acting.  The first two acts are very strong, especially the ending of the second act.  Unfortunately, the last act was frankly boring and even a bit frustrating.

To start off that act, we are reintroduced to the adult Chiron (""Black"") mimicking his father-figure Juan's life quite closely.  He pulls his car up to a driveway where we see three men standing and Black pulls a gun out from under his seat.  Then we cut to the 3rd act title card, after which we go to new scene.  Not only is this moment is never revisited, *neither is the gun*.

The impression that first scene leaves, especially after how the 2nd act ended, is that Chiron is now a dangerous man.  But we don't see any evidence of that again.  Chiron dresses for the part of a dangerous man, but his actions indicate that he still has that same sensitive boy inside of him.  Which is interesting as a subversion of a trope, but it just didn't work for me in the theater.

The presence of the gun hung over the entire third act.  I immediately thought of Chekov's gun (if it appears in the first act, it must go off in the third).  Surely the film wouldn't show me the gun and then never have it come up again?  One of the two friends I went to the movie with thought the same exact thing that I did: That Chiron had returned to Miami to kill Kevin.  I'm not saying that that's how it *should* have gone down, but I definitely wanted some indication that Chiron still felt a sense of betrayal after all those years.  In the version of the movie in my head, Chiron's return to Miami would have been fueled by a mixture of anger *and* longing for Kevin, which would have made the ending more poignant when the longing wins out.  So I guess what I'm saying is that the stakes for the third act were too low to make it compelling to watch.",5exe5g

dea6kvb,"Was this really Best Picture? All the talk was about how much Hollywood loves itself, so La La Land would win, etc. I think Hollywood loves something even more in this new political administration: a wonderful way to show how liberal it really is.

Moonlight getting awards buzz and only earning $22 million box office is not that impressive. Think of how few people really wanted to see it once (and not likely twice).

Is it really a movie about hope for gay/trans/other community? Not really. The hero never accepts that part of his life fully. Also, he's not that great a guy, right? Drugs destroy his mother and his own childhood. He grows up to sell them. Not sure I see much hope here.

Overall, after last year's OscarsSoWhite noise, and Trump's election, the Academy just needed a way to stick it to anyone not fighting for gay or black rights. Hidden Figures ($163 million) was a much better movie of hope for the black community and women. If one of its heroes had been gay maybe it would have given Moonlight a run for its (very little) money.

About the OscarsSoWhite issue, run some numbers if you're bored. How many folks in America are black. Take that percentage and average out the number of black nominations over the last 10 years. You may be pleasantly surprised to find that it's a rough match. I'm not saying this means it's easy or difficult to get roles as a black actor, I just like to look at averages as a sanity check.

Last year's OscarsSoWhite coverage reminded me of global warming deniers. They look at one season and say it's not real.

Also I noticed the use of water/waves/the ocean as a symbol for rebirth, transition and cleansing in all three chapters. All in all, this a beautifully crafted coming of age film, tenderly told through the lens of a very specific place and people.

Memories happen in snapshots, and we imagine what happened and could have happened in the past. In real life many times there's no crying, there's no time to cry, you only cry when nobody's looking.

The reason this film is great is not because of the homosexuality message, but rather how we can relate to people coming from background of hardship, of different culture. How we can feel their pain.

dce0euo,"I completely agree. Heteronormativity is extremely predominant so I can see the beauty of trying to transgress that boundary with Chiron and his fight to keep himself from being who he truly is, but I can also see how straight men can relate to this. Although straight white men are hardly ever marginalized by society (cisgendered that is) they do still deal with times of crisis and often feelings of having to live up to certain standards set by society. Gay or straight everyone has a fear of exposing too much. That is one thing I really enjoyed about this film. Another was how tender the moments between Chiron and Kevin were. Or rather, Black and Kevin. Beautifully shot.. the end left me a bit confused because I wanted more depth between the two but with subtly depth actually speaks louder.  ",5exe5g
dak4m2p,"> Of course I understand that being heterosexual is still more commonly seen as normal where as being gay is sometimes still viewed as abnormal

Well beyond anyone's definitions of ""normal"" or ""abnormal"" it's much more common to be straight than gay (though that could change in the future, no one knows) so the feeling and experience of being different that gay people deal with will still be there even when it's fully accepted.

To me, Chiron in the third act was mimicking the one real figure he had in his life to represent what a man should be: Juan. He admired Juan, so when he grew up that's who he turned himself into. The parallels even go as far as their names. Juan tells young Chiron a story about a childhood friend nicknaming him ""Blue"", and Chiron's childhood friend nicknamed him ""Black"". Juan tells young Chiron not to let other people define who he is, and ironically this becomes the standard by which he defines himself. It wasn't until that final moment of true honesty with Kevin that he peeled back the armor he had built around himself with this fake personality, and finally allowed himself to be who he really is.",5exe5g

For me, Trevante Rhodes in his most vulnerable scene is heart wrenching to watch. What an amazing talent. I really enjoyed Andre Holland opposite him. To me, he was channelling a bit of Prince in the diner scenes. Playful, quasi flirtatious with his doe eyes - his eyes spoke volumes. Frankly, that was what amazed me about the entire movie. So much stated without being spoken. 

And it took me a bit to remember where I had scene Andre. Of course it was his fantastic role in The Knick. (also highly recommend).

Little made him face his contradiction (selling his mom drugs) at that dining table but Juan was one-dimensionally stuck in the game until he died.

I don't necessarily agree that the movie was just a ""bunch of events to define"" Chiron that lead to no character building, but that he couldn't find a reliable moral/emotional compass in those events. The role of a black male without a father figure/role model, searching for one and tirelessly failing until shutting out the world and becoming a piece of what he resents.

After all, the story line and acting were both superb. However, the important, defining moments in Chiron's life seemed to have flashed by too quickly on screen and the movie outlined those situations in a bullet-point manner. I also liked it, but thought it could have shaved some time in the art-sy framing and put it towards character development. Whoever played Chiron in Act III was phenomenal and was really the highlight of the film (aside from Mahershala), the change in body language and character when he reunites with Kevin was done so well; even the initial phone call, you can see how much he put on his relationship with Kevin. I hate that I'm apparently in the minority with this film when, similar to you, I typically fall for these types of movies. ",5exe5g

but movies like this aren't meant to be that way. they're about subtlety and not spelling it out for you, ie not this guy's gay and sad because x, y, and z effected or happened to him. you're supposed to have an understanding that this is the way life is a d things just happen, life isn't made up of dramatic events but small things that we see and hear that shape us through out. it's what separates the movie for me and something else that's just blatantly telling me how to feel. life doesn't do that. the dialogue is a grade a example of this. nobody in this movie talks like some movie trope character. they talk to each other like normal people.",5exe5g

All of those things felt like they were coming right back into the forefront of my memory as I watched and I can't help but to just sit and cry these past few nights not even in pity for myself but that there are other people who have gone through similar things and who I can possibly relate to.

dailjqk,"I don't think you have to be black or gay to relate to Chiron.

Something everyone can relate too.",5exe5g
ddudh3v,"I like this theory, and I think the ambiguity of his last embrace with his 'lover' lends itself to some interpretation, however I left the film thinking he was infact homosexual - I feel like a heterosexual being called a faggot would resent homosexuality rather than embrace it. Also his wet dream would indicate that he has some subconscious desire for men.

The impact of him saying ""no man has ever touched me in 10 years"" gives me the impression that he has not been true to  himself for the past 10 years. While building himself from the ground up following his move to Atlanta, he really just ended up building a facade for who he really was. 

His mentor tells him that he should be who wants to be, and to not let anyone tell him what he should be. However he ironically does the exact opposite and becomes his mentor, sporting the gold chain, the trap lifestyle and driving the same car, even having the crown dash ornament. I think the time between act 2 and act 3 is him living how he thinks he ought to live, embracing every aspect of masculinity he knows from his male role model, and as we watch the final act we finally see the veil of 'being hard' slowly get cast away, until he finally embraces his lover in the penultimate scene. 

In the final scene, we are shown him as a boy from act 1, in my opinion showing his journey back to being who he used to be.",5exe5g

He might not be 100% gay (not a lot of people are, after all, sexuality is a spectrum) but I'm pretty sure if he would have felt attraction towards women, he would have at least tried something with a woman. Compulsory heterosexuality? Yes, something that exists, very much so. Compulsory homosexuality? Erm, I'm not sure. Also, if a straight guy gets called a f-ggot, of course it bothers them, but ultimately since they know they are straight, it's 'easier' to brush off.

dejsm6b,"The term ""faggot"" is a degratory term for gays, it implies that the person gets fucked in the ass thus is not masculine. 

If you're not familiar with gay culture, with gay males we have the terms ""top"" which means the fucker, ""bottom"" which means the fuckee, and versatile or simply vers which means a person that can be both. There used to be social norms tied to ""tops"" or ""bottoms"", the idea being ""tops"" are the more active or masculine counterpart, while the ""bottoms"" are the more passive or feminine one, similar to traditional views of gender roles in heterosexual relationships. 

But that have changed in recent years across the board, even in heterosexual relationships. Sexual preferences in bed does not imply relationship dynamics, you can be the more active partner that takes care of your partner in a relationship but prefers to be the passive one in bed, and vice versa. Deadpool loves getting pegged in the sheets, but he's a badass on the streets. 

I think Juan was about to say that ""not unless you like to bottom"", or more specifically ""not unless you like getting fucked in the ass"" or something along those veins, of which Teresa stopped him. ""Fags"" implies the person is at the bottom of the male totem pole -- there's men who fucks women, there's men who fucks men, then there's men who gets fucked by other men. The ""beta male"". This movie is exploring the idea of masculinity after all.",5exe5g
dgayw54,"Juan was going to get into nuance, as the word ""f4ggot"" (or any variation of it) is very nuanced.  It's like the word ""n---r.""  A young black boy never having heard the word before (I know, I know -- that doesn't really happen, but for sake of argument) might ask, ""What's a n---r?""  And Juan would explain that it's a word that hateful people use to make black folks feel bad.  ""Am I a n---?""  To this question, Juan would say ""no"", but the ""unless"" would be his way of acknowledging that black folks use the term to convey all sorts of meanings and relationships to other black folks.  It's nuanced.  

Juan understands, in that scene, that the word ""f4ggot"" is nuanced, too -- not even being homosexual, he knows that other gay men use the term and not necessarily in a demeaning way.  But Teresa's shaking head is just her saying, ""He's nine years old.  He doesn't need (or won't understand) nuance right now.""",5exe5g

Reasonably certain the idea of Juan's story about the old woman in Cuba that's the source of the play's title (""in moonlight black boys look blue"") is that the moonlight shows who you really are. That's what Juan's quote directly after it is about when he talks about being yourself and deciding who you want to be. Chiron has spent his entire life not knowing who he is. As a kid he didn't know who he was. As a teenager he tried to disappear so he could hide who he was. As an adult he made himself into someone entirely different -- a clone of his only father figure.

It is ultimately about identity, about finding connections in a lonely world, and how we all try to prevent ourselves from getting hurt. The film is, as one reviewer put it, 'the reason we go to the movies: to understand, to come closer, to ache - hopefully with another'.""* - from Andrew Pulver's review of Moonlight on The Guardian.

He was even carrying around Breakfast of Champions at one point, which was my favorite book when I was his age at that point in the movie.

But Moonlight affected me so much more than Boyhood ever did. As impressive and well-crafted as Boyhood is, and though there is a lot of legitimate pathos, it never reaches the emotional depth and complexity of Moonlight. Though it's ostensibly a movie about race and class and sexuality, and it does have a lot to say about these things, it never once feels preachy, and everything so naturally extends from the characters in such honest ways.

Boyhood feels similarly genuine, but the themes seem so trivial in comparison, and the fact that ""identity politics"" is such a hot topic makes Moonlight far more relevant.

Chiron on the other hand is also figuring out who he really is, but unlike Mason has to hide himself under this outer shell that he's built up for himself. The last act of moonlight is heartbreaking because we can see him putting on the act (Trevante Rhodes portrayed this unbelievably well) and we know he's hiding his true self, but it makes the final scene when he too is finally accepted much stronger than boyhood because getting there was more of a struggle.

And we're left to infer that the same is likely true for Kevin as well, given how he caved to peer pressure to haze Chiron at the end of act II and the fact that he has a child in act III. He kept up a facade of heterosexuality for his own social safety in the world they inhabited, but it wasn't true to who he really was.

>Although the movie does make connections to the gay/trans community, it also makes a nod at the hardships children face in a broken home the analysis of the movie at that level is extremely superficial. What the movie is really about is the loss of innocence in a child and that all humans want the same thing. They want to be loved. 

> That scene where they are on the beach was one of the few times Chiron felt like he was loved. The next scene where that same guy beats him up slaps that one bit of happiness right out of his hand. 

>The same is true of his mother. Mothers are supposed to love there children and be there for them but Paula was so busy with her own problems that she neglected him and he didn't get any love from her either. They only place he truly felt like he had some love was with Juan and this is also why he ended up becoming  a drug dealer like Juan is cause that is what he saw. 

>Notice how even though the movie takes place in a primarily urban setting with mostly African American characters yet the score doesn't have a single hip-hop or rap song on it. Instead Barry Jenkins goes with classical music. Ask yourself why he does this. It's because classical music identifies with the human condition better then any other type of music with lyrics would've done. Humans from any caste or creed or gender or ethnicity we are all looking for the same thing and that is to be loved.

dagl3zp,"> Juan's death felt like a huge missed opportunity. He dies between chapters and they only mention it once, indirectly.

Definitely a huge missed opportunity -- in Act One I expected Juan to eventually die because that's how narrative usually works -- the 'older teacher' character gets killed once his student is at a point where he must use the knowledge he's learned.  

But Juan just disappeared.  For a character who was integral in Act 1, it was uneven to have him disappear in the others and not have it be properly addressed.

> My mind was in a dark place when he started to mentor Chiron. I've seen hustlers take kids under their wing, and it's always to get them into the game. 

I think there was some missed opportunity for depth here, as well -- I had the same idea when Juan started mentoring Chiron -- and I think it would've been nice for Juan's character to struggle with the dilemma of recruiting someone / doing right by a helpless kid rather than him being so immediately becoming the perfect father figure Chiron always wanted and needed.

de9rb63,"It's a movie that requires a lot of attention, presence, and it absolutely helps to have a strong knack for interpreting the full linguistic range of film. The best comparison is listening to a person's words as opposed to listening to them, watching their face, watching their hands, taking in the whole of their person. The person's words are obvious, but you get so much more watching the whole. This is a particularly good analogy in the case of Moonlight because it's directly applicable; look at the way Chiron moves in the third vignette. Adult Chiron starts out with a puffed out chest, a grille, head tilted in a confident smile. He meets up with his middle school sweet heart and he collapses. He doesn't just get quieter, he physically collapses. Look at the way he moves, the way his eyes linger and his head tilts; he looks exactly like he did in the second vignette. Notice that those old movements are more obviously effeminate. That's what got him beat in the first place, from the time he was a kid. He always was visually distinguishable as effeminate, as opposed to Kevin, whose movements and body language naturally fit in with the masculine tradition. Chiron learned to suppress it and hide, but it all came rushing back with Kevin. And this is beyond just being black or gay. The blackness and the gayness are certainly factors, but the story of toxic masculinity and repression is absolutely universal, cropping up in places as unrelated as Pink Floyd's the Wall.

There are still more subtler, fuller characterizations of Kevin and Chiron's relationship, Chiron's character, all which would be missed if you just heard the dialogue. And it's not a problem with not being 'intellectual' or 'literary' enough. It's a Hollywood tradition to produce movies where all the content and plot and character is in the dialogue and the picture is for the pretty and the flashy. I like a lot of those movies, sometimes even for that reason, but it's not always the best but rather the most easily digestible way of making a film. Because of Hollywood's dominance, it's rather uncommon to be exposed to films that make use of the other elements of film with a few exceptions. The result is most people, excepting those who watch a lot of Indie or European movies, are not trained to search there for parts of the story. But there's quite a lot in Moonlight, if you can read it.",5exe5g

Same. I'm gay so I was happy Moonlight won b/c I saw it as kind of Hollywood redeeming itself for having snubbed Brokeback mountain back in 2006 and gave the award to the very cliche Crash movie instead. But at the same time I felt the last act of the movie was lacking.

The first two acts were great. I especially liked Teenager Chiron, his characterization of a repressed shy, mute, individual was amazing. Film critics praise the film for its subtlety and it was very much show not tell. But the third act could have used more tell, more self-reflection and dialogue from Chiron. Adult Chiron is the culmination of all that repression, especially his statement to Kevin how he himself hasn't touched anyone since that night at the beach. And a few minutes later after that statement, the film ends. I connected the most with teenager Chiron but the least with adult Chiron because I felt there wasn't enough time allotted to adult Chiron. 

Here's the thing though: this is very much an artsy film. I acknowledge that film buffs/nerds will be able to read more into this film than I ever can. And that's okay. Brokeback mountain on the other hand was a film that I thought was more appealing to both critics and lay audience members like myself. And Moonlight and Brokeback mountain do have some similarities. Brokeback mountain was shot beautifully just like Moonlight. Brokeback mountain portrayed their characters as having to struggle with reconciling their masculinity and homosexuality and Ennis (the one played by Heath Ledger) was very much unable to express himself emotionally, only doing so at the end of the movie. But without spoiling the movie in case you didn't watch it, Brokeback mountain had more self-reflection on Ennis' part towards the end of the movie, which finally let the movie watchers gain some insight on what was going on in his head and allowed you to sympathize with him more, ie "" feel invested or emotionally attached"" to Ennis. In contrast, I felt adult Chiron left too much unsaid. I mean so much shit had gone down since teenager Chiron. Too much was left out for me to get invested in adult Chiron. 

It is what it is, a good film, especially the first two acts, but the last act fell flat to me. Film buffs love it, while perhaps lay people like you and me only like it. Any connection I was starting to build with adult Chiron ended with the quick abrupt ending. Just wanted to let you know I, too, felt the same way you did. (well, except the predictability of the film. I've watched a lot of gay coming of age movies including foreign films from other countries. Gay coming of age experience have many common themes so there is only so much you can do to give an interesting twist on it without straying too far from what is a pretty common experience for every gay kid)",5exe5g

The 3 parts were a little too disjointed, and partly that was due to the casting (the 3 Chiron actors were hard for me to believe were the same guy), and partly the writing which moved between the acts without enough context.  Also didn't help that the slang combined with the tendency for guys wearing grills to mumble had me and the SO asking each other what was just said.

df97xt6,"As you say, we'll never know. But here are some things to consider... 

Kevin is happy in his life. He says his life feels worthwhile because he has a son, who he needs to care for, and because he feels free from the expectations of others. He left his criminal past behind him. If he were still involved in crime, he couldn't be dependable for his son (e.g. he might be put back in prison) and he would fall back into his old life which he felt trapped by (unable to be himself, instead being what others expected him to be - which it seems is someone who did things that result in jail time). We also know Kevin isn't happy with Chiron being a drug dealer. Given all this, does it seem likely that Kevin would want to find his way into Chiron's current life? 

The alternative is Chiron finding his way into Kevin's current life. But there are many things to consider there too. Firstly, Chiron is now a ""hard"" man, and a drug dealer. How easy is it to leave that life behind? It has a lot of trappings. Secondly, Chiron worked incredibly hard to build his new identity. How much strength, and energy, would it take for him to build another new identity from scratch? Or, if you wonder whether he can assume his childhood identity, before he turned himself into a ""hard"" man, how much strength and energy would it take for him to face the trauma of those formative years? Did he even really have a fully formed identity then, or did his troubled home life and social alienation not allow him to really develop as a person? Would Chiron ever be able to overcome the devastating start to his life? 

All of these questions/considerations make the possibility of a successful future relationship between the two seem less than likely to me. Which makes the gentleness, love, and humanity we see between the two of them at the end (and between Chiron and his mother - despite the pain of their relationship) all the more poignant. 

That's my two cents.",5exe5g

The acting was phenomenal, though.  Especially the third actor who played Chiron.  Something about his face and his subtly changing his expressions.  He was able to go from menacing to vulnerable in a split second without a word.

Throughout the film you're just filled with this aching sense of how insurmountable the odds are and I love how the film ends on a happier note without tying things up too unrealistically.

I also love how Chiron's sexuality didn't take over the plot and become the sole driving force behind it.  Not that there's anything wrong with that kind of focus, but it felt so much more real that it was a character element that caused conflict rather than the thing that defined him.

A huge part of the reason why this film is as acclaimed as it is because of *how* they handled the characters. Yes, obviously you've seen gay teenage angst and drug addict mothers before, but not really in the way it's presented here. Not all drug addict characters are going to the same, not all teenagers dealing with gay angst is going to be the same.

I'm sorry but where on earth have you seen another character like Chiron? And before you answer, I know you have probably seen another gay kid as a character, but there really isn't one that's portrayed like Chiron here. The struggles are presented differently even if the themes are the same. Obviously that's how it works, there are many angles to tackle an issue, concepts in life aren't just one dimensional pieces.

>A crack addict mom, nothing new here. A child exposed to drugs and neglected. A picked on homosexual. 

This is just poor criticism because you can reduce a lot of differences in multiple works by phrasing it like this. *""Luke Skywalker is a hero? Where have I seen this before? Luke Skywalker = Superman, nothing new here.""*

Going to stress again, not all gay characters and drug addicts and drug dealers are the same. It's like that in real life too, there are variances even if people have the same occupation or some overlapping similarities in their situations. Personalities still differ, subtly or drastically.


I can understand certain criticisms, such as the film doesn't really seek to utilize narrative accretion for some of it's resolution (the biggest one being, Chiron relationship being repaired) which may cause people to feel like there was a lack of a climax, but the characters being the criticism is rather weird and not really justified.

Mahershala plays that inner conflict to very moving effect, especially in the scene with Little.   I find your statement that Juan's compassion for Little ""didn't ring true"" as really ignorant.  Drug dealers are not robots; they're human beings with feelings and yes, they do feel compassion for other people.

I would say yes, you may still enjoy this movie.

Good character drama is good character drama. 

Plus, who knows? It might be nice to take a look at the world through the eyes of someone who disagrees with you. Moonlight offers an incredibly clear and effective vision. ",5exe5g

I think having it set in Georgia-Florida/the South/that time-period/in that environment gives us a setting that's unique to America and highly-relevant, while telling us a boy's story.

Those facets are present and unavoidable, but they're not what the movie is about.

You might not agree with their subjective experience as a person, but as a Christian, you should be able to relate to a person's overall struggles, regardless of their background or future. 

Yeah, you may find some parts uncomfortable. But, overall, this is a story about coming to terms with their life experiences and how it has shaped them as a person. I wouldn't say homosexuality is a key point, but rather part of the story. That being said, Im slightly liberally religious and massively socially liberal, so take my thoughts however youd like.",5exe5g

One of the best of the year though? For sure. And I think it's always beneficial to be able to empathize with people who are in a completely different situation than you and Moonlight facilitates that beautifully.",5exe5g
daoh8n6,"Without spoiling the movie too much for you, I would say yes the movie could still be enjoyable for you. The main character is dealing with so many issues outside of his homosexuality, so it's definitely not 100% focused on it. The gay identity stuff becomes more prevalent as he gets older, which makes logical sense. There is one scene of 2 guys kissing, a non-revealing hand job, and two ejaculations (one unseen and one from a dream). If seeing this stuff is going to make you hate the movie then I wouldn't recommend it

It is definitely not one of the best movies of the past decade, at least in my opinion. Hollywood and critics tend to overrate movies that are about current boundary-pushing issues (see: Philadelphia, Spotlight). This movie has its flaws, there's a lot of expositional dialogue  and a lot of dead time. Cinematography and score were solid.

The gun didn't feel like a Chekov to me; that scene was a quick and effective way to convey where the character is now and what his life is like, and it was self contained. I never thought Chiron felt animosity toward Kevin. He knows they were both victims. When he snaps he doesn't go after Kevin, he targets the person who actually hurt them both. As an adult all there is a deep, desperate longing and sadness, and every element of the third act conveyed that, from calling it ""Black"" --Juan told Chiron someday he'd have to pick who he wanted to be, and he picks the way Kevin saw him--to the phone call, to the nervous way he preens before he goes into the cafe.

Then Chiron going home and his mom asking ""How's Teresa? I haven't seen her since the funeral""

The acting is probably the strongest part of the film in its delicate intimacy. The cinematography is also really well done. The spinning shots are especially well done (the one when he gets hit by Kevin comes to mind). So I'm not really sure what you found pretentious about it. Also can you find a better word? I mean pretentious is the most vague thing to say in any criticism (especially when you're describing a visual facet of the film). ",5exe5g
daidaur,"Yes, but I found it flawed in its characterization, the plot, and its portrayal of homosexuality.
I found it disappointing in its third act, especially with how much critical acclaim it has been receiving. I found the main character flat, he seemed a vessel for suffering more than a character, playing to an audience love of trauma porn. I still don't feel like I know who Chiron is besides a quiet, shy kid that suffers silently and seldom fights back, a characterization I find both tiresome and problematic. 
A huge moment in act two lacks any kind of dramatic build-up, existing only to hurt the main character in a way I've seen done better in other films. The act breaks come at the most interesting part of their individual stories, leaving the audience wanting more and getting less. Instead of spending time building interesting and sorely unseen relationships in this genre, it spends more time on the bullying Chiron faces in school and on his troubled home life. While Naomi Harris plays the mother very well, we've seen the crack addicted black mother character enough times, we haven't seen much of two young gay men connecting or a drug dealer becoming a father figure for a young bullied kid.
On homosexuality, the movie is extremely chaste, with a dry, awkward romance scene, preceded by unrealistic, navel-gazey, poetic dialogue that comes out of nowhere in comparison to the rest of the film, and feels direct from the play it was based on. 
Our chaste, silent victim is a pure angel, barely engaging in any of that gay shit.

As a gay man with exclusively female friends in high school, i can say i've been there. I've been attracted to my female friends even though I'm not straight or even bisexual. When Chiron told his friend ""you're the only man who ever touched me"", i was like yup, i can say the same thing, except gender-swapped, to one of my close female friends. I might not go so far as to say he was abused, but I'll say this: if Chiron really was gay, the writer and director didn't know how to show it, just like Le Fou in Beauty and the Beast.

We can all relate to humanity, even if the character is from a different walk of life. You'll probably see bits of yourself in Chiron even if he's nothing like you - I know I did - and the film is a good encapsulation of growing up and searching for identity.

And like /u/tabingi said, it's a lesson in great filmmaking on a structural level, so you can appreciate the technical aspects even if you don't directly relate to the characters.",5exe5g
dalthr9,"how come you feel like you gotta relate tho?  not trying to be patronizing or anything, i'm just genuinely curious.  

i really suggest looking into any sort of art even if you don't think you'd relate to the characters.  i think for one it allows you to gain perspectives and understanding or empathy for people you don't know much about.  widening your perspectives on things like that really allows you to become, in my opinion, a better person.  i think an attempt at growing an understanding and empathy are the two strongest, most important characteristics someone can have.  it's not like you have to feel sorry for everyone either, i mean really having more perspectives really just allows you to have a bigger world view.

but i think what that really ties into is the fact that you gain an understanding that these people are more related to you than you realize it.  human suffering is universal.  people feel similar emotions on any spectrum.  you've felt sad before, everyone has.  you may have had your heart broken or been bullied, or whatever else.  you've struggled in some ways.  maybe you've rejoiced in some ways too.  you get an understanding that even if you cannot directly, 100% relate to any given situation, you can look at it from a step back and see that hey, this is a human problem.  just see it from a more abstract way.  it's what's lovely about storytelling.  good storytelling allows someone to see how characters are feeling even if they don't know shit about their life or circumstances.  it does let you be in their shoes and feel their suffering or joy, or whatever in between.",5exe5g

daljnax,"IMO, at its core, it's a story about someone who is unsure of who they are and how their identity is shaped or in conflict with their surroundings. The main character's journey to discover who he is (which extends past his homosexuality) is pretty universal, I think. There's a lot of themes covered, like isolation, desperation, forgiveness, and optimism, so even if you're put off by the premise, the movie still has a lot to offer (and it's not melodramatic or emotionally exploitive; it's a subtly directed movie).

Emotions and pathos aside, though, it's a remarkably structured and written movie. If you're into good filmmaking (from script to cinematography to acting), I'd really check it out regardless.",5exe5g

I also felt like the kid and the adult carried themselves in this calm quiet kind of ""what can I possibly do with this life?"" attitude. Teenage Chiron I didn't feel that way.

dckiqd1,"i agree with you wholeheartedly. sexuality is personal, is private, and part of what makes us human over animal (we have sex for reasons other than to procreate). Because of that, its tied to a person's vulnerability. Even though I'm heterosexual, I identified much with Chiron's view on his sexuality and how that influenced his emotional vulnerability---oh so poignantly illustrated in the diner scene. I've weathered a fair amount of negativity from others' expectations on my sexuality and how i express it and this in turn, heavily influenced my ability to be sexual or emotionally vulnerable with someone else. i think why this movie speaks to us all is because it captures one (huge!!) aspect of the human condition. the need for connection, for love, for acceptance, to express ourselves in a way that does not ask permission and does not seek forgiveness. and unfortunately society imposes so many restrictions and terrors on this basic truth by creating rules on sexuality; ie. homosexual love, girls being a ""ho"" if they express themselves sexually. And that damages how we can connect with others. Gosh I loved the final scene in the red light.

I've been thinking about this as well. My take is that Juan was going to give Chiron some ""conditions"" where he could let the word slide. Much like some folks believe it's ok to use the N-word. But Juan isn't gay. He's guessing. He can't tell Chiron when it's OK to use or allow others to use that word. 

There's a beat between when Juan says ""don't let anyone call you a f-ggot"" and ""Unless."" It's as though he's thinking about scenarios.

The bottom line is Teresa is wise enough to know that Juan has said enough AND it may be best not to give Chiron ideas on when it's ok to let people call him that.

Just because a black person was the main character doesn't mean the film was fundamentally *about black people* or about black feelings. In fact I'd argue that because there were almost no speaking roles for any non-black people in the film, that race basically served no purpose *at all* in the film apart from a back drop.

I don't know why you feel the need to separate humans on such a superficial level.

You can't have phantastical visuals that are clearly not happnening in the real world and say the film is a throwback to old hollywood musicals and then also have crappy singing.

It's pretty clear that the real reason is that they cast the leads for star power and not singing talent. As big budget movies can only be made nowadays with big stars at the helm.

The fact that both groups don't have diversity leads to this where they feel boxed in when a ""good but not great"" movie involves poverty, homosexuality, and minorities. It leads to people overrating a movie because they want to appear ""progressive"". 

As far as Hollywood's attitudes towards minorities I don't understand why they consider themselves progressive and forward thinking when the only celebrated depictions of minorities are when they are drug addicted and poor.

I think there's a reason why Juan felt a need to connect with young Chiron.  He saw a confused, sensitive boy and maybe felt empathetic--the scene in the traps.  He already knew what the home life was like and he must have felt sympathy if the boy 's nature (can't think of a better way to word it) just absolutely made it that much harder to grow up in that environment.

Haven't seen a drug dealer with a paternal instinct yet in films...and seriously how can a school bully where he lives being what he is not exist? How can that be a cliche, when it happens every day? I often see school bullies fake and cliche in movies, but this one handled it very realistically. You must not've grown up in or near poorer parts of town, because drug addicted mothers and school bullies are a plenty.

You obviously didn't understand the movie if you think Chiron was supposed to be any type of person. That's the point. The only time he's truly himself is when he's with Kevin. 

Visually, it's superb. The scene where Little is learning to swim is easily one of the best scenes of this year and the cinematography makes it simply art. It puts you with the character ridiculously well.

Kid chiron had a dancing scene. But at that age kids are pretty expressive and haven't really needed to self-regulate their behavior because of peer pressure. I mean if you want to call his dancing effeminate, that is pushing it because all I saw was a kid having fun dancing. 

Teenager Chiron? I saw nothing. Are you confusing extreme shyness with being effeminate? B/c what I saw from the teenager Chiron was someone who was very self-conscious, shy, and mute.

1. I looked at the screenplay, and we're both right. He said ""You're the only man who's ever touched me"" and ""I haven't touched anyone since.""

I'm not saying this lacks emotional depth, there's a lot of depth to this, but I feel it's more about the story of a socially awkward boy rather than a gay boy.

Which brings me to 2. This might sound strange to a non-writer, but speaking as a writer, your story can evolve beyond or apart from your initial intentions. Depending on your writing style, you could control everything that happens in your story or you can let it take on a life of its own.

If she's not supposed to be a nurse, you need to make that clear to the audience.) and what feels like 2 weeks later, she's sucking dick for rocks. It just felt jarring and unbelievable to me. I didn't understand what the overall take away is supposed to be concerning Little/C/Black's sexuality. (I'm just going to call him Black for the rest of this post to save time). Are we to believe that he's not gay but society (everyone thinking/telling him he is gay, the boys in the bathroom showing each other their dicks [I think that's what that scene is supposed to be], and finally Kevin jerking him off on the beach) makes him gay? Or is he trying to say that Black is really just in love with Kevin and unable to love anyone else? If the story had other plot elements to it, I could forgive the ambiguity but it seems to be the story that is being told here so I think that making this unclear is not a good way to reward an audience that has sat through a slow moving two hour movie. Two other quibbles that are less serious to my enjoyment: 1. I gathered from the talk with Kevin in the diner that Black went to jail or juvie for the chair incident. I understand that the criminal justice system can be a bitch to african-americans but, where I'm from, dude would have gotten ALC; he's under 18 and clearly had been beat the fuck up only a day prior. Finally, I would have liked an element of danger to Black or Juan selling drugs. There was a zoom in on the diner door at the end and I thought this was going to be a rival or the cops or something but it turned out to be nothing at all except, maybe, Black regretting driving from ATL to MIA. 
So yeah. Overall, it was a well made movie (also, Janelle Monae looks fine as hell) but I don't think I would recommend it to others who have a hard time with a fairly slow moving, personal story that, in my opinion, didn't add up to much.

damlnio,"I also really liked the introduction to the 3rd act and thought it was an effective and economic scene *in the moment*.  My problem with it is that it was too self-contained. Almost everything we see in the 3rd act after that introduction serves to show Chiron on a trajectory toward the eventual conclusion.  We *only* get to see that same emotional reticence that Chiron had expressed throughout the rest of the film, and none of the sharper edges to his personality that appear in the 2nd act's closing and 3rd act's introduction.  For me, that robbed the 3rd act of dramatic tension.  Once I realized that the gun and the violence it implied was not going to show up again, I knew what the ending would be.

And you actually mentioned that moment, when I realized that the gun was not going to appear again: When he nervously preens by his car in the diner's parking lot just before his reunion with Kevin.  When the gun did not show up again in that scene, I knew that Chiron had come all this way back to Miami hoping to reconcile, without malice in his heart.  That was it for me; the tension was undone.

Regarding the potential for malice that I mentioned, I get that Chiron's true persecutor was the bully that he retaliated against in the 2nd act, but it was Kevin that had *betrayed* him.  Betrayal comes from trust, and Chiron had just begun to trust Kevin on entirely new and deeply intimate level the night before on the beach.  When Kevin allowed himself to be manipulated by Chiron's bully that was so much more hurtful than if the bully alone had pummeled Chiron himself.

It's essentially a collection of pretty looking shots that don't do much to tell/develop the story of this character. I left feeling like I understood him less than I did when the film began. Weak directors will rely on a unique visual style to mask their shortcomings as a storyteller. With good directors these elements are usually seamless. In regards to the acting, I think the script gave them very little to work with. Harris's character is essentially the same cliche drug addict mom we've seen a million times before and the central character to me came off kinda blank, empty, and far too passive to really connect with an audience. You call this delicate intimacy- I call it boring and a slog to get through. Essentially I do think pretentious is the most appropriate categorization here.

dh0yisv,"You're seriously suggesting sitcoms are the standard for portraying gay characters? 

Firstly, the writer of the play this is based on, who also took part in writing the script of the film, is openly gay. The film and play seem obviously semi-autobiographical, and it is consistently alluded to - by other characters mentioning it - that he was considered to be obviously gay from a young age. The fact that you don't see him conform to a pantomime gay stereotype is the stupidest reason to not think it was a good portrayal of a gay person.

It's very deliberate that he struggled with his sexuality, and so it isn't clear if he is gay, bisexual, bicurious or even just attracted to one person (Kevin). That's what this film shows well, which is why it goes over many people's heads. People aren't charicatures, nor do they obviously fit into neat boxes. Chiron is Chiron, and he has sexual desires that he struggles to deal with, largely due to societal pressure. ",5exe5g

I strongly disagree.

On the right is [Jaden Piner as Young Kevin](http://cdn2.thr.com/sites/default/files/2016/11/moonlight__anatomy_-_still_-_1_-_h_-_2016.jpg). On the left is [Jharrel Jerome as Medium Kevin](http://sailor.mnsun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2016/11/Moonlight-2.jpg). More or less the same skin tone, hair texture, hairline and jawline. Even if they hadn't repeated his name for us, Kevin looked similar enough in both iterations. It's textually significant that Kevin be consistently lighter-skinned than Chrion, considering the dialogue surrounding whole ""Black"" nickname.

The bully, though, [on the left in the black shirt](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ifhMFLXwZsU/maxresdefault.jpg) has darker skin than Chiron, and certainly much darker than any Kevin, as well as different hair textures and hairlines. ",5exe5g

To completely ignore that is not fair to those who have dealt with experiences specific to being black. There is a lot of crap that comes with that which cannot simply be felt by a white person. I think it important to recognize that without trying to make everyone the same... we are not all the same even though we are all valid. 

There are several elements of the film that relate to the human experience outside of race/gender/sexuality, for sure, because the story is a coming of age story. Personally, I responded and related to the film because it highlights the main character's loneliness, which broke my heart. 

I am not separating humans on a superficial level, race is a legimate topic of discussion that greatly impacts our lives, and we need to address that full on in order to strive towards the type of equality that you are assuming happens between whites and blacks.

Sorry if I'm going too hard on this, I just find it interesting and I find your argument very thought provoking! Honestly. Here is a piece of an article by Eddie Huang that I love, because it better explains what I am trying to get across: ""The feeling of being different is universal because difference makes us universally human in our individual relationships with society. We’re all fucking weirdos. The social contract is here because we have a collective desire to be individuals and preserve our rights to pursue singular happiness with or without cilantro. But we’ve been fixated way too long on universality and the matrix’s pursuit of monoculture.

Juan baptizes Chiron in the sea that is homosexuality, the beach is once again where Kevin and Chiron have their homosexual experience, just a hand job though because they are on the beach and not in the sea.  this leads to bad experiences for all of them until, as i have explained before, Kevin finds walks the path of the straight and narrow with a heterosexual relationship.  isn't the last shot of Little, alone looking at the ocean?

I'm fine with characters like this. I just need some depth, not some after school special level characterization.  Especially if our main character is going to be such a blank slate.

If you thought that scene on the beach with Chiron and Kevin was naturalistic, more power to you.  I thought it was a cute scene, but natural is not how I would describe it. 

Also, the close up on Chiron's hand gripping the sand when he had an orgasm... cmon, surely the filmmakers could come up with a less cliché way to convey that.

That night at the beach was probably one his happiest memories. His excitement about Kevin reaching out to him/seeing him again probably overrided his anger about the situation.

dajblj9,"But then if self-discovery is the main crux of the film, wouldn't we expect to find Chiron at some point? We never do though. He never does either really. 

Because the film presents him as a very monochromatic ideal instead of a living, breathing person. The first act seems like it will set that up, but then he just bumbles through the rest of the film, never really learning anything, just sort of dealing with repression and derision as it comes. This really cheapens the third act because it relies on an arc of growth that never really lifts off in the earlier two acts. 

Case in point, Kevin is asking Chiron in the third act ""Who he is?"" Exactly, we never know, he doesn't know. Hell the director doesn't even know. He just knows he wanted to make this story, which is fine. It's an important story. But we can have a film about self-discovery where the character actually feels like a person instead of just an unidentifiable cardboard cutout. They're not mutually exclusive.

Too often filmgoers (and some filmmakers) treat movies as if they can be boiled down to a specific message or theme; thus they view films like arguments that are designed to specifically change our minds about things. The good ones have no interest in this, they simply expose us to images and ideas.

damq23x,"The third act was tense, but the tension was entirely interpersonal and emotional, not a question of balancing on the edge of potential violence. The audience clearly knows how Chiron feels, but we don't know if he'll take the risk and make himself vulnerable, nor do we know how he'll be received. Kevin doesn't know his history or how he feels. Chiron coming to take revenge would have been totally out of left field, at odds with the character development and logic. In that scenario, he apparently cares enough to shoot Kevin because he called to reconnect ten years later, but he didn't care enough in those ten years to hunt him down? Especially since when it happened he *did* seek revenge, and it wasn't directed at Kevin. For him to have a reversal of feelings ten years later because of a quiet phone call doesn't make sense. The way he punished Kevin was by not staying down and forcing him to hit him again, knowing it hurt Kevin to do so. He's completely aware that Kevin's ""choice"" was to either do it or become a target and get the shit beat out of him constantly, too. It wasn't really a choice. It still hurt him deeply, but he's not naive and as in other cases (Juan's drug dealing and his mother's addiction, for instance) he sees shades of grey and understands people can be in fucked up circumstances. 

It's all very consistent with his character development. He's always been sensitive, hungry for meaningful connection and love since childhood, and he isn't a malicious, resentful, or vindictive person. The only instance of violence we see from him is directed at someone who did nothing but torment him and others. Juan, his mother, and Kevin all failed him in some way but he loves them and can contextualize their failures. He still yearns for those connections and he forgives his mother, who did more to hurt him than Kevin did. There was never any implication of violence toward people he cares about or any subtext of animosity toward Kevin when he gets the phone call; the tough guy thing is what he does to make money, not who he is, and that's clear from all of his personal interactions. The way that was presented, where we just see enough to infer what his 'street persona' is like but everything we actually see on screen is ""real Chiron"" is I think very intentional.",5exe5g

dh16ti1,"At least you acknowledge the ambiguity of it. Most people think he's undoubtedly gay. 

I could see how the sitcom comment came off wrong. I didn't mean sitcoms are good at showing gay characters because they show them as caricatures. I meant there's no ambiguity to it, and that comment was less a critique of Moonlight (as it didn't aim to show an undoubtedly gay man, people just talk about it like it did) so much as Disney or any future movie that wants to draw positive pr by saying a character is gay and hint at it like crazy in their portrayal, except that if you were not aware of the pr, if you went into the movie not knowing anything about it, you would have no idea his actions were hinting at anything because he didn't show obvious interest in the same sex. If a movie wants to label a character, it should either have the character show obvious interest or the makers should do what JK Rowling did, which I thought was clever, and just casually say that a character was gay when their sexuality was irrelevant to the story. Disney could learn from Harry Potter in that sense. As for Moonlight, his sexuality was relevant to the story, but the only person he showed interest in was Kevin. Not necessarily gay; not important. The events are important. Our interpretation is only secondary. I'm just saying - and you said it too - that we don't know what his sexuality is, and that's why I take issue with people labeling him gay. Labels constrict interpretation.

Maybe you need to stop listening to what other people think, and start listening to yourself.

Most people engage on multiple levels with a film and with most art forms.  There are multiple ways to be entertained.  Being entertained means different things to different people, depending on their experiences and knowledge and tastes.  My expereince, knowledge and taste did not allow me to get much enjoyment or entertainment out of the first two chapters of Moonlight.

dgbh8a3,"In the 10 years between part 2 and 3, he surrounded himself with people who are not remotely like him. I would be surprised if a woman didn't try to feel him up once or twice in the position that he's in. He just didn't touch back (he said ""I haven't touched anyone since"", not the other way around), because it felt empty to him. There was no connection for him to feel, because the environment was nothing like the real him. That's why he was so attracted to his friend yet again when he reconnected with him after so long, because the friend was the only one of his peers who really understood him, and the friend showed that with the way he talked to him, the way he knew that Chiron's facade wasn't the real him, and that's why their second encounter wasn't sexual but just a comforting embrace. This shy innocent boy lost in the world he grew up in, who lost his adoptive father after part 1 and his adoptive mother after part 2 still found someone who understood him and comforted him. Some people said the lack of a kiss at the end seemed ill-fitting, but that's because they thought this movie was about his sexuality.

It is achingly difficult for Chiron to broach the topic that Kevin is the only man who has ever touched him. And what do we see after that? Chiron crying on Kevin's shoulder. There's no romantic embrace, no sudden joy in that revelation. There's just Kevin consoling Chiron, who has struggled for so long. Then aside from maybe one or two more shots, the film ends. To me, that signals just how crucial that moment was. Chiron had bottled up his sexuality and finally addressed it head on, and maybe *now* he can finally move forward and grow in his sexuality and his life.

One of the problems I have is that the protagonist is just too one-note and under-developed. He's gay, black and sad and we get versions of that idea over and over again without much of a sense of who he is outside of that. I think sometimes directors can be too emotionally invested in their material and end up with something that just doesn't expand well beyond the devoted art-house crowd. 

I wish the movie didn't have so many pregnant pauses and slow patches.

dgy2023,"**TLDR:** I wasn't totally comfortable with my own sexuality myself when I got married, so to me it wasn't an important part of my identity I felt needed to be strongly embraced. Furthermore I assumed she basically just didn't want to end up my beard and would chill out once we started having sex and she realized everything in that area was fine. [I ended up writing a lot more than I anticipated. You can also skip to the last two paragraphs.]

I don't mind at all. First, you have to understand that my own understanding of my sexuality at the time of my getting married was fairly limited. I grew up religious, and still am. So when my sister came out when I was in middle school, my father reacted poorly. As did I. She is only two years older than I am so it was not long afterward I started to feel sexual urges as well, just not how I anticipated having them. I was fascinated with male bodies, but I had no idea what that meant. I was a late bloomer physically, and a naturally curious person generally, so I assumed my newfound fascination was a manifestation of my own anxiety about the changes my body was going through and how I would develop, would I always be small, etc. Along with standard pornographic images, I was also reading articles, some less scientific than others, about average penis size at different ages, and so on.

This whole time I was disgusted with myself. I considered myself a freak because my mind found it so hard to drop the subject. I longed for guidance but I was far too afraid to ask for it from anyone in real life. You can imagine the quality of guidance I got from strangers online.

When I went to college I wasn't suddenly less religious. My religion was and still is something I cherish. My plan was to save myself for marriage, but during my college years I had my first, and only, premarital (pseudo?)sexual experiences, with a guy from the dorms, who I later worked with. Because of our work we shared living quarters. These experiences were not totally consensual. It's hard to explain. He kept pushing my boundaries, and I kept unhappily adjusting them to permit more and more. I felt terribly guilty and tried repeatedly to discuss it with him, but at the same time he was one of my best friends, perhaps the best male friend I'd had my whole life, and I kind of didn't want to risk losing that. And terrible to admit, but true, sexual experience physically feels good whether you feel guilty about it or not.

Eventually the guilt I was feeling got so intense I started voicing my displeasure more and more. I think essentially what happened is I made myself annoying to him, and as he started to become busy with other things, our ""relationship"" just kind of casually faded away. For a while I put up big mental barriers about his involvement in my life. When I talked to him I would read into everything he said to see if it would be healthy to let him back in. It might sound crazy, but if I could have waved a magic wand that took the sexual part of our relationship away and kept the friendship, I would have done it in a heartbeat. He was strangely a very good friend in many other ways and I considered that friendship invaluable. Eventually he contacted me saying he had looked back on his actions during that time, felt sorry that he had not treated me well, and that whatever my opinion of him was at that point, he understood. It was easy to see then, and at all times we have been in contact since, that he was sincere.

All that is to say that all the bi experience I'd had my whole life was extremely confusing to me. How much did I allow that situation to happen to me? Surely my complicity was a factor. How much was I to blame? Was I really attracted, or did I just convince myself the situation was not that bad at the time, as many people do under stress? I could easily remember how uncomfortable I was when the advances began, though that discomfort was less defined later.

During this time I had slim to nothing in the girlfriend department. No confidence really. I liked some girls, but didn't know how to talk to them, and for the girls where I did figure it out (few and far between), they had boyfriends or were otherwise not interested. So my ability to develop an understanding of that part of my sexuality was basically zero, unless I wanted to try a random hookup, which I was opposed to for many reasons, though I thought about it often.

In my late college years I became extremely poor, so I joined the Coast Guard Reserve in the hopes of getting back on my feet. This did wonders for my confidence. Immediately upon return to the real world, I attended a wedding where I made up my mind to talk to the prettiest bridesmaid. Thus I struck up conversation with the woman I would later marry. (I still never asked for her number. One can only progress so far in two months of boot camp, I suppose.) Right after that I went to California for continued Coast Guard training, and much to my surprise and delight, she contacted me! She had gotten my information from friends, and it was so uplifting to feel that for once I was the one a woman wanted.

We wrote each other at length online, and she half-jokingly invited me to help her move to grad school when my time in California was up. I jumped on the opportunity and there we became official. Then I turned right back around to continue my college in another state. So our relationship still did not really have a physical side to it, as it took place 99% over Skype. After a year of this, I put my schooling on hold and moved to where she was. Then the physical side of things began, slowly. I was still unsure about everything. Since we weren't married there was little I felt like I was allowed to do, and being physical still made me feel kind of wrong. How much of that I should attribute to the treatment I had suffered was hard for me to untangle. She was clearly unhappy with the pace at which we were advancing, and honestly I wanted to give her more than I was giving, but you can imagine that feeling pressured by her didn't make things any better and really just felt all too familiar.

I tried to explain that to her, which was a disaster. She became paranoid that I was 100% gay and would one day realize that about myself, and then where would she be? I tried with little success to convince her that wasn't the case (but honestly, I knew my own ability to judge had been clouded). When she learned I was still in occasional contact with my penitent friend from college, she freaked. By that time we were engaged, but the ugliness that ensued almost ended everything. She demanded I sever ties completely, but I wanted the freedom to be friends with whomever I pleased. I wanted to feel trusted, which I didn't. She was uncomfortable about female friends I had too, and I really didn't want to sacrifice friendship after friendship on the altar of her anxiety.

We were already in premarital counseling, which I had always wanted to do before getting married and was unrelated to these events. On this topic our counselor encouraged us to work things out and get married all the same. His logic was that since we both wanted to work it out, what did it matter whether we did so before or after the wedding, which was coming up very soon and would be difficult to postpone. He also agreed with her that cutting ties with the friend was in everyone's best interest, so I reluctantly agreed.

Perhaps more to the point of your original question, I suppose it seemed to me this whole time that she viewed bisexuality as a threat to her marital happiness. She was worried it would make me unfaithful. I, on the other hand, have always been confident that I can and will be monogamous. So I figured once we were married and started having sex, she would see our sex life going smoothly, know the threat of my being unable to be attracted to her was not real, and she would relax and be happy. I knew her feelings about the morality of homosexuality were not totally settled, but she seemed be wrestling with it, and I just assumed that most of her resistance came from not wanting to be screwed over and have to endure divorce. I thought once that was addressed she'd be fine. I was just wrong about that.

In recent years I've realized my attraction to both sexes is neither academic nor is it merely a defense mechanism I designed for myself to make the experiences I had with my friend easier to mentally handle. It's just part of who I am. Yes, I wish my wife could embrace and love that part of me, and it's sad that she doesn't, but honestly considering that I am monogamous anyway, my sex life is not distinguishable from a straight man, so we generally handle the topic by ignoring it altogether. It makes her happier to be able to forget about it, and it makes me happier not having to deal with her insecurity. When I feel a desire to express this part of myself, generally I do so without her knowledge. She is now pregnant with our first child, and I'm as committed as ever to making the relationship work despite this area of struggle. My biggest concern is that if the kid is LGBT it will cause some dysfunction in our house, but looking back on what my sister experienced by being open and what I experienced by being closeted, I've decided that if the kid should turn out to be queer I will be vocal in support of him or her even if it costs me my marriage. Of course I hope that doesn't happen, both because my fingers are crossed that the kid is straight (easier to navigate society; less bullshit the kid will have to endure), and because I'm hoping that motherly affection would overrule whatever discomfort my wife still retains by that point. Heck, the issue is unlikely to surface for another decade anyway, so who knows what could happen in the intervening time, and it might never become an issue.  ... So, I think that just about covers everything, though I'd be willing to clarify anything if you still have questions.",5exe5g

> You do realize you're in the extreme minority here, right?

Yep, critical consensus is obviously important to you.  I am too old and have seen too many movies to care what other people think.

Look man, I went to see Moonlight first weekend it opened in LA, I walked out of the theater being fairly underwhelmed.  My date and I spent $30 dollars hoping to enjoy it. Going in I had read a brief paragraph review and seen the trailer.  I knew nothing about the plot or anything.  I had a feeling it was going to be about being gay and black though, the trailer made that fairly obvious.  The trailer and review also set me up for something that this movie was not - A cinematic masterpiece.  Those high expectations certainly didn't help matters, because I was constantly thinking... when does this get good?  

I have laid out some thoughts.  If you think they are douchey, that's fine.  My reactions are honest reactions.

I am a person, I react emotionally to things.  Moonlight wasn't one that hit me.

It feels like Chiron is just a machination of the writer/director more than an actual being that we, the audience, can relate to.

Okay fine if that's the story to be told, but what did anyone really get out of it? 

I'm not going to forgive the director for not aspiring to a better expectation of improved characterization. Even if that was his aesthetic choice, it just doesn't make for resonant storytelling. 

Is it a beautiful and significant film? Yes I think it is in many ways. Is it a masterpiece of storytelling? No I don't think so. Do I think Barry Jenkins has a promising future? Yeah I'm optimistic, he's get some real directorial chops. I just hope he improves as a writer. ",5exe5g

I'm sorry to hear about your friend in college coercing you. At times, my long-term girlfriend in high school/university would use my insecurity and dependence on her to get me to do what she wanted, so I know first-hand how shitty, guilt-inducing, and unfair that can feel.

As for your wife, thanks for sharing that story, as well. It's always illuminating to get a glimpse into the lives of other people. When I read your first post, I couldn't understand how a bisexual man could want to be married to an anti-gay woman, but now that you laid out all the steps involved in your life and decisions, I can better understand the circumstances that led you here. I'm a straight man, so I can't directly relate to your experiences, but as a

She woke up and what did she said to Chiron? ""You don't love me no more..."" that's a bloody hurtful thing to say to someone who is doing the exact opposite thing. 

If /r/raisedbynarcissists gave their advice they'd say that he should've just her cut off completely and never look back, she's poison. I thought Chiron will never forgive Paula when he hung up on her the first time she called him... He listened to her voice message, and before the call with Kevin the first time he said something along the lines of ""ma I'll come see you tomorrow, I promise"". That implies that they may had more than one conversation on the phone... He still couldn't cut her out completely. 

And yeah, he still met her at the rehab, and still he talked to her respectfully... His mom said something along the lines of ""you don't have to love me, I know that because I knew I never gave you the love you needed. But I want you to know I love you.""

Kevin even wipes away the result because he is ashamed of what he's done.  this probably led him to following the path or righteousness later in life.  Kevin is so happy in the last chapter because he's finally found peace through the proper procreation that resulted in his child.  he reaches out to Chiron because he knows what they shared was a true brotherly love that in their youthful confusion (and because of Juan's homosexual example to Chiron) they mistook it for sinful homosexual lust.  Kevin uses this newfound sense of peace and love to allow Chiron to break free of his homosexual past, as evidenced by the chaste hug and the cut to a scene of a younger Chiron no longer in the sea of despair that is homosexuality (the same sea that Juan baptized him into)

Then you understand you didn't see what everyone else saw?

The only shot of a hand on sand that I remember is where Kevin wiped off semen. Maybe there is one where Chiron gripped sand, but it would've been such a short shot in a pretty well shot movie it'd just be nitpicking, imo. 

>Yep, critical consensus is obviously important to you. 

Yes and no. All opinions I have given are from myself. I am simply pointing out you are in the minority of those who have an opinion on this movie, I did not mention anything about critics. However, I do rely on critics to guide me on what movies to spend my money on, as I love to watch movies but not bad movies, and my money is tight. Not sure why taking advice from people who you tend to share the same opinion with is a bad thing now. 

>I am too old and have seen too many movies to care what other people think. 

Yet you reply to my comment and share your own opinion. We all care what people think, that is simply something most every human shares and do not take that as a bad thing. It's perfectly fine, it's part of what makes us human. This paragraph has nothing to do with the film. 

>The trailer and review also set me up for something that this movie was not - A cinematic masterpiece. 

>I have laid out some thoughts. If you think they are douchey, that's fine. My reactions are honest reactions.

Those two sentences contradict each other. You are laying out thoughts, yes, your opinion. Yet you present them as fact. You claim this is not a cinematic masterpiece, but who made you the person who decides what and what is not a cinematic masterpiece? If you say ""well that's just my opinion,"" then just say it's just your opinion that you don't enjoy it as much as others and don't state it like no one should consider it a cinematic masterpiece. And before you argue ""I'm not saying no one else can..."" because yes, yes you are. Unless you add in something like personally or imo. 

Here is an example: It's like me saying ""Climate change does not exist, I am a scientist."" Are you saying this classifies as my opinion, rather than me providing a statement like it's fact? 

>But I am sure 2001's main ideas center around characters. That sounds like Kubrick.

Not sure what this argument is meant for, as Moonlight's main ideas center around characters. I also won't comment on 2001 for this part, don't want to spoil it for you. 

>I bet the visuals of Moonlight are just as good as the visuals in 2001. It seems like a great comparison you are making there. ???

They are completely different in the way they use cinematography. It would be unfair to compare them, but in my opinion 2001 definitely has better cinematography. I mean it's Kubrick, what are we gonna talk about how other so and so considered great movies aren't great because it's not as good as Kubrick's cinematography? 

My point on mentioning 2001 is the similarity between their main characters. You haven't seen 2001, so of course you do not understand. But if you find the main character in Moonlight boring and showing no emotion and you find that a major flaw, then you definitely will not enjoy 2001.

Many gay people are ""weirdos"" just because they are so exceedingly genuine. They have decided to say "" cuss it"" to society's opinions about their sexuality, and from there it is that much easier to say "" cuss it"" to society's opinions about everything else. This mindset extends to others in the community: ""That's who you want to be? Awesome! There's probably somebody else in the room who likes that too!"" That's great and everything for learning to accept yourself, and I'm glad I got to experience that influence. However after a while I just preferred my friends from other areas of my life who I felt like I related to easier. This was all before meeting my wife, and it's not something I discuss with her.

I actually don't know very many queer people, other than my sister and a friend of ours from high school. I used to have a running buddy who was gay, which was no big deal to me. My wife wasn't thrilled about my hanging out with him (this was while we were long distance), but I did anyway. We didn't really have anything in common other than running, though, so when I moved away we more or less lost touch, even though now we live in the same area again. My wife occasionally talks cuss about my sister and her friend, to the point where now I have basically said that conversation topic is off limits. I do have another friend who lives one state over who is bi and she is married, and her hubby is cool with it. If I am looking for somebody to be sympathetic or if I want to ask somebody anything LGBTQ related, she's my go-to person to text. My wife knows about the friend and that she is very political and pro-gay rights, but I don't know if she knows the friend is bi herself.

Thanks for the well wishes. Sorry about your bad girlfriend experiences. I hope things are better for you now.

det3kdc,"That two nightmare sequences really got to me. The first time we saw Paula shouting, the director chose to silent her voice when she shouted, then she walked into her room. Her room was lit with red/pink lighting... *Oh Roxanne(Paula), you don't have to put on the red light*. We kinda have an idea when she had that new hairdo and she had a man over when Little came back home from swimming with Juan... The after school bullying scene where the bully went to Chiron's home confirmed that Paula was involved in prostitution to pay for her drug addiction. 

The second time the nightmare scene came around we finally heard what her mother said when she shouted... She used the phrase ""don't look at me"". She was ashamed of what she's doing, she didn't want Chiron to see what she's doing, she vented her own shame on him, yet that childhood memory haunted poor Little forever since. 

I'm not sure of the symbolism of the flashing blue and red light before both nightmare sequence though... On one hand they looked like police siren lights, on the other hand it flashed blue before act two, and it flashed red before act three.

And Janelle Monet was his adoptive mother. Being attracted to her would have been weird for him, I would think.

I'm not trying to be contradictory and I hope my messages aren't coming across that way. I do see the points you make, and I'm not ruling out that Chiron might be gay, but with our limited view of his reality we cannot be sure. Am I mistaken, or were the only women he interacted with his mother and his adoptive mother? We don't know how he acts around women, and the 10 year gap in which he hadn't touched anyone else doesn't say much, considering he's in an environment where no one's like him and he doesn't have an opportunity to connect with anyone.

I'm trying not to sound like I'm nitpicking, but I'm just not convinced that he's gay. He's attracted to his friend, his only friend, as far as we can tell. With that being his only significant connection outside of his adoptive parents, that love can go a long way, straight or gay.",5exe5g

Because  in that sense, someone is only identifying with Chiron so far as he is a victim that is essentially continuously put through the ringer throughout the story. Again, there's no growth from these situations. Just continued portraits of victimization that make the audience feel bad about this poor child. Like I said earlier, the equivalent of a Sarah Mclachlan infomercial. There's nothing else that connects us to the character.

And yet the movie would be not quite but nearly the same if Kevin was female because i say Chiron's sexuality is irrelevant. ""Where the hoes at?"" He doesn't take any pleasure from cheap meaningless sex. I'm saying he's not indisputably gay. I'm saying his sexuality is irrelevant and it's more a story about sensitivity, someone seeking meaning and connection in a world that fights sensitivity, where to survive you can't show any weakness, and the movie is brilliant for exploring that.",5exe5g
damnytu,"Yeah it's always refreshing to have a meaningful discussion on Reddit so thank you too! 

I agree with your first point that representation matters. I'm very happy that this movie got made. It's an important film. I just see it as a missed opportunity in some ways to really take it to the next level. 

I wish the perseverance that you connected with so much felt more palpable to me. There are only flashes of it in the film I feel. Chiron just feels so mute throughout most of the rest of it. 

Let's put it this way. I really liked the scenes with little Chiron with Juan. Also the one scene of him dancing. I wish that had been expounded on a little more. Finally, the scene where he finally relents from his inaction and goes and smashes the chair on Tyrell (I think his name was?). That scene is expertly written and directed (the little uncertain look down that Chiron has before he enters the classroom is so subtle and perfect). And I just wish we could have seen that part of Chiron a little more, because that felt much more human and real. 

Problem is Barry Jenkins decides to fast-forward us so far in the story then and to try and claim the emotional climax in the third act that I don't really feel like he earned up to that point. ",5exe5g
