Having Debra say ""holler if you need something"" just hit me like a train over how I used to be acclimated to hearing that, and how no one where I am now talks like that. 

The biggest one, by far were the radio stations. There's a close up as Baby is going through, trying to find something to listen to, and I thought ""well there's no way they're getting this right."" And what does he tune into? 97.1.

This might be my favorite movie of the year so far. The music fits perfectly and is timed amazingly to EVERYTHING.

I had no idea where the story was going to go, and by the end I had a big stupid happy grin on my face. The third act has to be one of the most exciting finales I have seen in quite some time.

Biggest points

- Jaime Foxx stole almost every scene he was in.

- My heart literally skipped a beat when he pulled the gun out at the diner.

- The stuff with his foster dad was incredibly heartwarming. 

- Romance with Debora was incredibly sweet, and probably the best romantic sub plot of the year.

God damn, Edgar Wright has done it again!

Also, I KNEW I SAW KILLER MIKE! HOLY SHIT!

dji5lbw,"Easily my favourite film of the year.

* I'm guessing a lot of people realised this, but in the opening music number when baby is walking to the coffee shop you can see various lyrics plastered on the walls. 
* And talking about openings, how great was that initial car scene? It really set the pace for the whole movie.

* I really loved how calm the film was at points but then just flat out 100% action at points as well. I think it was really well paced due to the fact you don't feel burned out at the end. 
* Every character was genuinely interesting and could have easily had more screentime, and I especially love how they avoided Baby getting away with his crimes as it made it more realistic.
* Just wondering whether the sequence towards the end when Baby got out of jail, was that real or a dream sequence?

* I thought the broker backstory would be a nod to Mad Men but they weren't in finance I believe.

 Anyways I absolutely loved this movie and even though critics are enjoying it I hope it does well at the box office. 10/10 for me.

djjndms,"There are so many things right with this movie, but for once can we all appreciate that the main character in an action film actually had to face serious consequences for his actions? I mean I love the John Wick movies, but the guy killed like 300 people and no one outside the assassin's guild even gave a shit. Baby kills two people (more or less righteously) and even with all the positive testimonies he gets 25 years. It's still a little light, but it felt so much more real than many other films in the genre. ",6jxijs

dji5zak,"Also, let's give Edgar credit for coming up with one of the most brilliant pieces of British comedy I've ever seen on an American movie screen. 

Baby wants out of the criminal lifestyle, so he rams the car into a pole and runs like a maniac far away from the cops into a mall and changes his clothes. He nearly evades the cops but the tags on the clothes triggers the store alarm which raises the attention of the mall security. So now Baby's running through the parking lot with **two packs of cops** on his tail and nearly evades them by stealing a car, only to crash into five different cars, one of them being driven by the two criminals *he just fucked over*.

This entire sequence made me laugh harder than anything.",6jxijs

djhscp1,"The editing/music is low hanging fruit so I want to geek out on the script. Edgar Wright really understands how to tell a story through the medium. Every single beat of the movie felt like it had an introduction, a link and a payoff. I have not seen a movie so tightly wrapped in so many years. There was nothing left wanting.

Something as innocuous as the Monsters Inc line was set up with the television in act one, had the joke set-up by the nephew being in act two and then hit with Spacey's line in act three. The stolen line itself was used three times in the movie to, introduced via Mike/Sully, used by Baby and paid off in the final confrontation.

They set up the Baby's foster father grabbing the stereo to listen which helped relieve the absolute SADNESS I felt when Deborah commented on his mother's singing voice and we couldn't hear it.

The humming effect was so jarring, especially during the Peachtree Centre Mall scene and just brought me to Baby's level of anxiety, I've never felt so in tune with a protagonist before.

Jamie Foxx was incredible, the car cherography was great and I need to see it again and again for that first 20 minutes and all the visual incredible work it put forward.

Wish Wright had better cameras though, the night and interior shots were so full of noise from lack of light. I guess that is the limitations of a $40m budget.",6jxijs

Seriously though, as a guy who likes to edit, all of Wright's movies are visual orgasms for me, and Baby Driver was no different! 

Already planning on another viewing to see all the background visuals Edgar loves to throw in all his movies that I missed (didn't even notice the lyrics graffitied on the buildings during Baby's first coffee run at the start).

djjivad,"There are 3 things I love about this movie:
1. The Cast
2. The Action
3. The Music
4. Any Little Easter Eggs Sprinkled Throughout
(Shit, that's 4)

I enjoyed this movie too much, had some weak moments, and the ending felt a *tad bit* stretched out, but it was so damn good. This movie was far from slow, and woke me right up upon starting (felt wiped out after a long day). I never wanted to turn away from the screen while watching, and I tried to soak up every last detail I could get, from dialogue to background. Unfortunately, I couldn't get everything, *so I guess I'm just gonna have to see it again* (or maybe 3 more times). 

What I didn't expect was the really dark turn at the final act. Everything went to shit, and you felt that change all around. Although, some people were clapping when Bats died, and I had a nice smile on my face too. Buddy becoming the antagonist was also something I didn't see coming, since he always was one to defend Baby, but his turn was justified (although maybe he could've died a bit sooner). Jon Hamm is absolutely amazing in this, I know he's getting a ton of praise already, but he is just great. Back to the ending, it wasn't exactly what I expected, but I wasn't surprised to see it go down like that. Baby/Miles is a good person, and I love how the people he helped decided to vouch for him, even if he was a criminal. I also love how the final 'fantasy' at the end begins to gain color, bringing into question if it really happened and Baby and Debora got their happy ending. I could go on and on for a while about what I loved about this movie, so I'll cut it off here for convenience.

Oh, and I lost it when I saw ""Blue Song"" appear. For anyone who doesn't know what it is I'm referring to, give this a watch: https://youtu.be/iHbndkcLM6A

Like all of Wright's films, I'm seeing Baby Driver many more times, and it's an absolute blast.",6jxijs
djhru2r,"Fucking loved it. Music is a huge part of my life, I am a gigantic nerd who often alters what he's doing to match the song he's listening to, and this movie hit every single one of my pleasure centers. I remember thinking things were dragging just a bit at one point. That was maybe five minutes before Bats made fast friends with that hunk of metal and Hocus Pocus by Focus started up. I fucking love that song, it's a stone cold classic, and for the entire setpiece I was just jaw wide open, giddy grin on my face.

I mean, on surface level, this is a heist flick that has a lot of cliches. But it's the love put into every shot, the humor, the music, the editing, the acting that breathes a new level of light into it.

I think at this point I'm just rambling. Edgar Wright is my favorite director, he has been since I saw Shaun of the Dead when I was 13, and this was just a jolt of pure energy. Loved it. Tell your friends.

""If you don't see me again, that's because I'm dead."" And we never see him again. So fucking good.

djjofgq,"I thought it was interesting how they played around with the audience's expectations of what was going to go on with the characters. I thought Buddy and Darling were going to sympathize with Baby and help him escape from Doc and Bats. Turns out, Doc is the one standing in front of Buddy's rampage.

I thought the choreography and pure style of the movie was hands down pure amazing bliss. I've seen so many car chases in movies, to find something unique is just so refreshing. I did find it a little hard to root for Baby after he turned down a perfect opportunity (twice!) to leave the crew and run away with Debora, but instead insisted he could be their driver or that they should do the job.

Oh, and Buddy saying he'll hurt the thing Baby loves most and then shooting his gun next to both his ears was just such a great scene. I didn't even think of those stakes until he did that.",6jxijs
djj8c51,"I was pretty lukewarm on Boss Baby but I was surprised by how much I loved the sequel, Baby Driver.",6jxijs
dojym03,"I have a few gripes with this movie. Overall it was solid, but its overall quality makes those little bits of annoyance stand out that much more, because surely it occurred to Edgar Wright at some point that these flaws were there and he just didn't have the time necessary to iron them out.

The dynamic between Doc and Baby was weird. The whole premise of Baby working for him was that he was earning back what he'd stolen, but Doc let him steal it in the first place. And even still, did Baby not make any money from stealing from him? Did he immediately spend all the money he got from it? If not, he could've just given back the money. The premise itself is flawed, it pretends like Baby genuinely thinks he's indebted to this person and then he'll eventually be let go. Doc shows himself to be an asshole eventually, that he refuses to let Baby go even after the debt is paid, and at that point all pretense of civility should be out of the window, he's holding him against his will at gunpoint. Why would Doc believe Baby would continue to drive for him? He's a great driver and it sucks to lose such a talent at your disposal, but the alternative is what ended up happening, which is that Baby gets tired of your shit and you end up fucked, which you had to see coming, especially since Doc insists on continually hiring at least one person per heist that outright shit-talks and hates on Baby for no reason. It's such a common occurrence that he carries on his person no less than three sunglasses at all times, because invariably they end up taking them or fucking with him somehow.

So why. Why hire people that make your drive unhappy? For that matter, why hire people that are mentally unstable? Bats may or may not be insane, it could just be a front, but either way he killed a cashier for literally no reason, jeopardizing the entire crew. And of course he killed your arms dealer and all your corrupt cops. Why would you have this person on your team *once*, much less *twice*? And Doc knew all about him, Bats himself touts how everyone on the street knows him. He tells Baby, ""You know I don't use the same exact group more than once, right?"" which at the time I took to mean ""You won't have to deal with Bats again"". Except naw, he's right fucking there in the very next heist he puts together.

Why was Baby recording everything? I know the reason he gives, that he likes to make music out of stuff, but it's the stupidest part of the entire movie. He knows he's doing illegal shit. He knows he's working with killers. He knows that if he gets found out that he's in danger. Why would he do this? He stands to gain nothing from it. He could walk down the street on his own time and make recordings of that. He's supposed to be a smarter character than this would suggest, and on top of it it doesn't even end up mattering in the plot! What's the point!

Possibly the most minor gripe is when Darling dies. She and Buddy are in a shootout with the cops, and she just walks out in front of the car she was using as cover and starts shooting and is immediately gunned down. What the fuck! Why! How fucking stupid is she? It wasn't even like she was doing it to distract them so Buddy could get away, he ended up having to still shoot his way out of the situation after she died. She literally did it for no reason other than so that Buddy could get pissed off at Baby.

But it all comes down to Doc. He's the mastermind character. He has information on everyone. He plans everything out ahead of time. He continually allowed Baby to work in a hostile environment - he didn't go out of his way to make sure he felt safe or valued, despite him being ultimately the most important part of every heist. Everyone can shoot a gun, everyone can put money in a bag. Only Baby could drive like that. But he allowed him to be treated like shit, and that ultimately fucked him over. And he did it consistently enough that Baby could come to expect it every time. It's like he's smart when the plot needs him to be and stupid when the plot needs him to be. If he was actually as smart as every other aspect of the movie wants us to believe, this wouldn't have happened.

Another minor gripe is that veteran guy who randomly shows up with fully automatic weapons ready in his truck shooting at them in public. I was 100% ready for that to be a plot twist - that was the last job until Baby was freed, maybe Doc hired a hitman to take the team out to ensure he couldn't work for anyone else afterward. Nope! Just some random guy with fully automatic smg's in his truck happened to come across the robbery.

It's really irritating that these stupid aspects of the movie are actually core to the plot of it. You'd think these would be the first things to get sorted out. And it's not like it *couldn't* be sorted out - if Doc was his foster father, that would've given them more of a relationship for Doc to rely on, to use as emotional leverage, to be betrayed by in the end. If Bats had a specific skillset useful to the heist that couldn't have been done by anyone else, it would've made him an asset despite his instability. It'd have to be a ridiculously rare or useful skillset to warrant not shooting him on the spot after he took out the arms dealer, but it would've made way more sense than the literal-nothing explanation the movie currently gives.

It's still a good movie, but it should've been better.",6jxijs

Blue Anything to do with Debora or running away.
Gold Anything to do with Baby's mom.](#spoiler)

[For example in the beginning all the cars and colors are mostly red, it's not till we meet Debora that we start seeing blue. When they kiss at the laundry mat there is red, blue, yellow in washing machines, because all of his emotions are hitting him at once. Debora always wears blue, the note Baby writes her on the napkin is in blue crayon, the car Baby is playing with on the table when he knows he wants to dip is blue, the first car in that heist is blue, also that heist has a lot of purple going on which is a mixture of blue/red, on the foot chase he grabs a blue hat/jacket, and yellow sun glasses. The mustang Baby steals is red as he's breaking the law again, his gloves were red and he throws them away. Debra wears a gold dress and reminds him of his mother, his mothers tape is gold. There is a neon sign in the diner and only the words TO GO are in blue, etc...](#spoiler)

djqnuht,I liked that whenever Baby didn't have on headphones you could hear his tinnitus. ,6jxijs
djhvk6s,"I'm torn.  Stylistically, I loved it.  Changing the cutting/style to match the songs was a great idea and perfectly executed, and the ways of immersing the audience to the tinnitus issue were brilliant.  The choreography and timing of this movie will hopefully be a cue to other filmmakers that taking your time to block out a scene properly pays off in triplicate.  It was a joy to watch the action unfold, and that's not always the case in an action movie.  

On the other hand, the plot was kind of a jarring mess and it detracted from the experience overall for me.  Debora needed to be given way more in terms of independent motives and personality, as in the film [she's pretty much a sycophantic pretty face to agree to whatever Baby wants to do up to and including murder.  Also, the minor acts of kindness Baby displays over the final sentencing montage don't begin to compensate for the killing and robbery he held a tacetly supportive role in.  Debora shouldn't wait five plus years to have a boyfriend she's spent less than 12 hours total with, and Baby had ample opportunity to put her out of danger earlier on. ](#spoiler)

I ended up leaving this movie more fired up about the compositional/technical aspects than I did any of the characters or any of the plot.  I really want to see Edgar Wright broach a really challenging film next (in terms of themes).  He works so well with detail and he's able to get emotional resonance when he wants it, it's just hard to get past the cartoony characters and easy resolutions he's using so much right now.  ",6jxijs

dm1xg88,"I just think the story writing really dampened this film for me. 

I really wanted to love this film. And I was loving it. The acting was fucking top notch. I mean really, really great performances from multiple characters. And the casting was outstanding.

The soundtrack was great and obviously the editing that corresponded with the soundtrack so well... that was just such a treat to watch. 

One thing I didn't get, what the fuck was up with the random dude in the blue pick up during the armored truck heist? Was that just some rando who had a mp5 in his backseat and willing to chase down armed robbers or...? Is that like a common thing to have someone undercover following armored trucks? 

Anyways, the ending of the movie just really did not feel in sync with the first half of the movie. All the sudden characters are no longer following their arcs. Baby gets fed up with all the killing and just kills Bats... okay, kind of justifiable I guess, he was a piece of shit murderer. But then shoots  Buddy and doesn't hesitate to hold some randoms dudes at gunpoint for their car. Seems kind of weird that the guy who was so obviously trying to stop the killing going on around him then kills. 

Doc goes from ""fuck you"" to ""run away I'll sacrifice myself"" in like 30 seconds just because he sees Baby has a girl friend? 

I can't say that Buddy's vengeance isn't reasonable... but that whole plot line just seemed unnecessary and is when the movie went from great to just another cheesy action film. 

I don't know, I think my expectations were maybe too high, but I really did love the first half of the film. 

I want to just give the movie an enjoyable 6/10. The music, editing, and humor were enough to give it that score. But then That writing just really got on my nerves, but then I remember how good the performances were... Idk. I want to give it a higher score. First half of the movie is easily like a 7.5 if not an 8. ",6jxijs

djph4kq,"After seeing Baby Driver for the second time I noticed that  the ending is foreshadowed. At the beginning when Baby is flipping through channels a bullfight is shown. The announcer says something along the lines of "" the bull bloody but determined presses forward while the matador off of horse and must finish the fight on foot"". This is foreshadowing the ending when Baby fights Buddy. Buddy is bloody from the fight and Baby has to finish the fight out of his car, or horse, and kill Buddy on foot. Buddy is further compared to a Bull in the diner scene when Darling tells Batz that, "" when Buddy sees red all you see is Black"". Buddy sees red throughout the final fight because the cop car he stole illuminates  his car with red light. Edgar Wright never ceases to amaze me with the amount of detail he puts in his movie.

TL;DR:
The final fight between Baby and Buddy is foreshadowed when Baby is flipping through channels ",6jxijs
dki76uj,"I REALLY liked this movie. Hard not to with Edgar Wright. It definitely had comedy, and witty comedy at that. The soundtrack/music presence in the movie was A+. The plot wasn't anything special, but it was executed well. I also thought Baby and Debora had great chemistry. I rarely ""feel"" like characters are attracted to/love each other in movies, but this was one of them. I also loved the Baby's relationship with his foster dad...wasn't expecting to get a little choked up. 

Also, LOVED Jon Hamm and his reversal of character. I legitimately think he liked Baby a lot, but Baby just (inadvertently) got his lady killed, and then he ""saw red"" and went insane. 

My only complaint is that I felt the end climax with Hamm and the following getaway/capture/prison/release scene dragged on slightly too long. I would have personally they rather just have let Baby and Debora get away free, but I can see why some may disagree with me. Very good movie, I give this an 8.5/10",6jxijs
djs8d76,"Small thing that I found incredible; the Baby produced the music using clips of conversations, and the scene where we watch him put together a song. When we watch him craft the music, it's simultaneously letting us watch him at work in something he truly enjoys - and that enjoyment is infectious to the extent we vicariously feel his satisfaction at the finished product. Later on when that same song plays it feels the complete opposite, amateurish and even child like - achieved through the context  and situational differences.
The same song, but generating completely different reactions both from the characters in shot, and us as the viewers. 
Absolutely great movie. ",6jxijs

dkvdqb0,"The movie premiered yesterday here on my country. The hype was huge for this one but I think it was justified. I really liked it but I was expecting to like it more. I don't wanna beat a dead horse by saying what everyone has already said about the great action scenes, performances and so on, I want to talk about a few things that felt really off to me after watching it.

- The movie opens with an amazing driving scene. It was actually so amazing that the other driving scenes felt meh in comparison.
- No awesome driving sequence when he is delivering pizzas. I mean, c'mon!
- Jamie Foxx's character literally kills or wants to kill EVERYONE he sees. I get that it was sort of a setup to when they go to the diner, but it felt comical after a while.
- Darling just stood in front of a lot of cops, shooting two guns, without cover. I don't think Baby was the only one to blame for her death...
- Doc threatens Baby and Debora and then sacrifices himself to save them because ""he was in love once"". Oh...
- I have no idea why they went out of their way to make Baby go to jail at the end. We get that he is no ordinary criminal and has a good heart, we watched the movie. That felt unnecessary but I guess Wright thought the ending needed a little more and he added that scene in black and white of Debora waiting for him earlier in the movie and that's the way he chose to ""complete"" it. It was an... alright ending.

Wright has style. That's the word everyone uses when they talk about him. He has a lot of style, yes, but he doesn't really know how to end a movie in a way that isn't underwhelming in comparison to the rest of it -- Scott Pilgrim and The World's End are good examples. These things I didn't really like didn't bother me while watching because of his directing, these things only bugged me a few hours later when I started to think about the movie. His shots keep your eyes really focused on the screen all the time and you don't even notice some problems on the writing.

EDIT: Baby falling in love with a girl that is basically his mom was kind of weird and way too Freudian for me.",6jxijs
doazkb2,"I think it was a fun movie, the action sequences were really entertaining, and the music was superb. But I think there were two big flaws.

* Doc went from ""you do this job or I'll kill you, your girlfriend and that old man that lives with you"" to give him a ton of money and literally sacrifice himself for him in 5 minutes.

* This might be more personal, but I fail to see how Buddy ended up as the bad guy. Baby snapped and messed up the mission, that got Darling killed. Debora was an innocent person, she didn't deserve to be killed as revenge, but from Buddy's perspective he was doing the same thing that Baby did to him.

Overall, it was a good movie, it was good that Baby went to jail, wouldn't have been fair if the he just got away with it.

There's a few minor quibbles (too many endings, the almost cameos of Griff and No-Nose), and it's the most fun I've had at the cinema in ages.

Also I am going to have to totally reappraise my opinion of Ansel Elgort as an actor. The dude plays the perfect straight man to everyone else's scenery-chewing lunacy, and is able to convey exactly what Baby is thinking with a twitch of the eyebrow or the snapping on of yet another pair of sunglasses.

She was still willing to after he freaking shot a guy and found out about his dark and illegal job after saying she loved him for being a good and nice person? She still wanted to after being away from him for 5 years while he was in prison??? Also he's supposed to be a good person why did he shoot and kill people despite how bad they were when he was so against killing before? Also Doc was willing to save their lives to get out of that mess even after he threatened to kill baby if he ever left? And then died for him? Where the heck did that come from???

Every decision felt like the decisive moment - the potential to take the movie in a different direction so much so that we the audience were caught up in the whirlwind with the characters. Will baby drive again? Will Debora get shot? Is Buddy a bad guy or do we understand why he turned on Baby?

Interestingly I felt the first half of the movie felt like a musical without singing characters whilst the second half was pure action.

The ending was a good one, I'm sure there's disagreement about whether Baby deserved jail but he was a criminal after all so I think it was just. Though with regards to the final act I did feel there were too many ""boss battles"" which made it feel a bit dragged out.

Also Lily James in that waitress dress. Amirite?",6jxijs

He said that Baby Driver and Suicide Squad were very similar in the sense that they basically played like one big music video - incorporating a new song, or even several, for each new scene.

The difference with BD was that the music was incorporated very organically, with genuine purpose, and ultimately moved the plot along. All the better that most of the songs were relatively unpopular, despite being very catchy and awesome.

Not once did this movie feel like it was dependent on the popularity of the songs to make up for an otherwise weak plot. Very much the opposite.",6jxijs

doi8tzh,"This movie was pretty fun, but the writing around the Bats (Jamie Foxx) character really takes one out of it. The movie plays around with the idea of Spacey as a badass and these criminals as scary people, but when Bats literally acts like an unstable psychopath that threatens all their lives, they don't do anything about it as he seems to have some kind of retard plot armor. 

Realistically, anyone involved, except maybe Baby, would have immediately killed Bats after he took out the arms dealers. Baby could have also just gone to the bathroom and texted or called Kevin Spacey and told him about Bats.

I mean, I'm not expecting any sort of consistency like from realistic movies like Ronin / The Town, or like from over-the-top but respectable movies like The Departed, but I feel like even characters from Tarantino movies or stylish ones like Shoot 'Em Up or maybe even the earlier Fast and the Furious types would have executed Bats on the spot.

djj9d1f,"I'm not nearly as clued in on movies and their many facets as a lot of people that post on this subreddit but something about Baby Driver ticked every box for me.

As a whole, it moves fast. I can't recall a moment in the movie where I wasn't feeling some kind of emotion. There was very little waffle and I appreciated that. Sure there are moments where you have to suspend your belief (I'm not so sure someone could actually hotwire a car that fast) but it fits within the world we are presented.

There are a great many people saying all the characters are 2D and I think for a majority of the movie those people would be right. But I also think they came and went with a fitting rhythm. I appreciated that the comedy wasn't thrown in your face but instead was highlighted by sudden tonal shifts - if I'm being honest the flow of the movie definitely felt just like a playlist on shuffle. Perhaps an intentional subtlety to the movie?

The chases were exhilirating but I would have really appreciated some longer shots. I don't know much about Wright's style but I definitely believe the movie would have benefitted from having more chase footage in it - might be a selfish want of mine though.

Perhaps the most satisfying element to the movie was indeed the music and sound design. I have to comment that, as cynical as it sounds, I think someone definitely tried to follow the GotG model of ""people will associate these great tracks with our movie and that will help carry the popularity further"" and you know what? It'll probably damn well work. Matching scenes and even single shots ever so subtly to noise cues was immensely satisfying, and to know that it was intentional gets a big thumbs up from me. 

Lastly, I just want to say that whilst being a brilliant action movie, a lot of the characters seemed very human. This is probably mostly a testament to the actors and actresses but I never for a moment felt that I was watching ""generic hard man #3"" or something to that effect.

I loved the movie but I can appreciate where others might not be so thrilled. Perhaps it is a big ole doss about but goddamn me if it isn't an enjoyable one.",6jxijs

I do agree with everyone else that the ending is flawed though. I didn't find it as bad as everyone claims it to be but... it felt kinda TV movie-like? Specially the parking lot scene. The on-foot chase and the bridge bit kinda made up for it though.

However I wouldn't say that the ending is the main problem as much as it is that the first two acts hadn't been really preparing anything for it to be effective. For example: at the end Doc sacrifices himself to save Baby and Debora; one could guess that since he grew fond of Baby over the time, even since before the events shown in the movie, he'd give his life for him. Yet he says ""I was in love once"" right before that part so we are suggested that he didn't take that risk to save Baby but to save his and Debora's love. We aren't exactly introduced to anything that might tie that character's feelings to anything Baby's and Devora's future together might mean to him. If anything the movie should've been longer (man, I wish it had been longer, it was great fun) and allowed itself some slow burned pacing to tighten some character's arcs because a lot of conclussions came out of nowhere

Best doesn't necessarily have to be the most awesome script in the room. It was a hell of a lot of fun if you like car chases and heist films (which I do - Bullit and The French Connection are two of my favorite movies of all time.) The soundtrack is awesome. Little things like gunshots and putting coffee on a table are synced to music so well it's like watching a dance. I found myself sitting up straight and smiling during certain sequences. 

This is not a drama. This is not a feel good movie. It's simply a good action movie with some incredible car chase scenes in it - cars that in many ways, dance to the music. I want to go see it again. I would definitely pay twice. 

Favorite scene was definitely the opening sequence though...I love Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.

dllgpqt,"Bit late to the party here but I just watched baby driver, I thought it was great! I loooved the beginning scene with some lyrics in the background and the interaction with the music.

A couple of details I think I noticed (someone tell me if im wrong), at the end of that scene with the music, when baby enters the doors, on the left it says “one more time”, pretty sure that was because they have credit to edgar wright for the second time. 

The other thing was Darling saying when Buddy sees red, the other guy sees black. At the end, Buddy is engulfed in flames as Baby sees black (from passing out).",6jxijs

djm3fpp,"This was an exceedingly enjoyable movie.

The music had me smiling and tapping my toe throughout the film.  

The choreography was the most obviously impressive part of the film.  I was also impressed by the performances of Ansel Elgort and Lily James (mostly Elgort). I don't think I've seen them in anything before, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that two actors I'm unfamiliar with turned out to be charming and capable of being the leads in a movie with some heavy hitters, like Kevin Spacey and Jon Hamm.

Finally, I'll mention that Edgar Wright continues to impress.  He's such a clever filmmaker, his comedic sense is impeccable, and all of his films take advantage of every element of movie making: visuals, audio, the writing, editing, performances, you name it.  It all comes together beautifully.

Jon Hamm coming back at all after the diner shouldn't have happened, in my opinion. No need for him to become a Terminator all of a sudden, and he definitely didn't need to die three times.

Kevin Spacey went from ""get out of my face"" to ""I'm going to die for you"" in the span of 30 seconds. I wish he just let him take the tape and leave.

The curtain could have then either closed when Baby wakes up in the car, or when the cops arrest him. Either way, the prison montage was extremely unnecessary in my opinion.

Of course the editing/sound design/acting/direction etc is incredible, I can't fault the movie there. To me though it just sort of missed the mark, it wasn't funny enough to be called a comedy, and I found the plot to be lacking so you're left with no real driving force behind the movie. The plot seemed a little underdeveloped and sort of picked up and dropped new threads way too fast for any single one to really develop, and I wasnt a fan of how the finale turned. Its a shame as I've been looking forward to this for a long time, definitely a good movie, but I have no desire to re watch it again which is definitely a first for an Edgar Wright project. ",6jxijs

The tension when Baby finds Buddy at the diner while Barry White's You're My First, My Last, My Everything is playing was straight up harmony. Tense scene, deep bass thumping love song, and the context of [Buddy being vengeful for Darling's death.] (#spoiler) Extremely stylized movie with the editing. Going into this movie not knowing anything except that it was scored high on RT, I didn't expect to be this entertained. And of course I look up who the director is, and it's Edgar Wright. Three villains/antagonists, all them with unexpected twists and turns.

djhwde0,B-A-B-Y Baby,6jxijs
dji3b6m,"I'm not sure where to begin or end so I'm just going to start by rambling for a bit about how impressive this film is from a production standpoint.  
  
Edgar Wright's films never fail to impress with the tightness of their production, but this is on a whole different level. This was essentially a 1 hour and 53 minute music video. Every shot, every scene, and half of the dialogue is meticulously choreographed and timed in about five different ways.  
  
Take the long take near the beginning for example. In this ~3min shot Baby walks through the streets of Atlanta grooving to his music. He bumps into people, taps to the beat, and sometimes sings along in a way that feels utterly realistic. This is a guy happily boppin' down the street to some music. He walks past dozens of graffiti tags, street signs, business names, and objects that either read or reference individual lyrics at the exact moment they appear in frame. Then he enters a cafe and you think all the impressive timing is over as he orders coffee. But no! The shot continues to hold and he exits the cafe delving into more exquisite timing! Every step he took, every little tap and step he made, every extra that he bumped into, every line that anyone uttered, every minute move of the camera -- it all had to be planned and executed down to fractions of a second! It's not a musical, it doesn't feel like a musical, but in all the most difficult-to-execute ways *it is a musical*.  
  
This is on par with La La Land in terms of choreography but with the added challenge of making it all diegetic and realistic! FUCK that shot is impressive!  
  
And the rest of the film is like that as well. All of the music in the film is diegetic and so the characters will sing to it or reference it at key points. That takes so much organization and planning in the pre-production stage and then just as much practice and fine-tuning in production. If these things aren't done to a T, the edit becomes near-impossible. Music is the lifeblood of this movie. And I'm sure it wasn't without its hiccups -- no film is. So hats off to the editors as well because I never once felt like the edit was lingering or cutting too early to make the timing work. All the traditional responsibilities of an edit are seamlessly blended with this monumental challenge of syncing it all to the music. Oddly enough, the only places where I would criticize the editing are in some of the dialogue scenes between Baby and Debora in the diner. The shot/reverse shot is often done so fast that lines run together a little and we don't get those reaction shots or pauses that let us inside the head of the characters.  
  
Now on to the non-technical stuff! So spoilers beware, obviously:  
  
I am very pleasantly surprised and satisfied with how unpredictable the plot was. The trailers sold the idea that Spacey was the villain then the film was building up Foxx as the baddie with Hamm being the good guy who was on Baby's side. We got all of that and then also had each of those things turned on their head throughout the course of the film in a way that made so much sense!  
  
I love that Doc truly cares about Baby in the end. He's a ruthless criminal, but he's also been working with Baby since he was a kid. He has a heart! When Foxx's character kills the Butcher and his men, Doc doesn't hold a grudge. And whenever anyone picks on Baby, he sticks up for him. Neither of these things seem to imply any kind of softness at the time, but in retrospect they are very telling of the character we eventually see -- the man who cares so much for Baby that he sacrifices himself for him and his young love.  
  
Foxx's character is creepy and unhinged. At first it seems clear that it's an act -- bravado, nothing more. But then as the film goes on, his true insanity unravels. It's hinted that he hurt people offscreen, then he almost shoots Citizen Rambo on the highway, then it's hinted that he killed a cashier for some gum just before he guns down some gun dealers for seemingly no reason. Each action makes it slowly more clear that he will indeed kill indiscriminately because *he likes it*. Then we see him murder an innocent man in full view of us and Baby and that's when both us and Baby know for sure. Now he's definitely the bad guy! Look what he just did! How's this going to--oh, Baby killed him. So who's the bad guy now, Doc?  
  
Nope! Surprise, it's Buddy (Hamm)! The two scary, violent characters who have directly threatened Baby and his loved ones aren't the antagonists. Buddy is. And not even because he's a bad guy but because of the result of Baby's own actions. This makes him so much more sympathetic and understandable because up until this point we've been endeared to him. He was the *one other criminal* who actually, genuinely liked Baby. For all intents and purposes, he was built up as an ally. And then he's trying to kill Baby and...it's justified. Baby got his wife killed. The prototypical bad guys were already well-rounded enough to be great antagonists but the film goes further and takes this even more interesting route when it didn't have to. No one feels safe. There were several points where I was convinced Debora was going to die. I fully expected Hamm to shoot her in the diner then get shot by the cops leading into a final showdown with Doc. That would have been perfectly fine -- pretty satisfying, even! But no, we get more than that and I'm so glad for it.  
  
Speaking of Baby's actions having consequences, that's another thing I loved; everything that characters do feels weighty and important. There's no wanton violence here. Every bit of every heist hits like a punch to the gut and you can feel the disgust and the shame that Baby does by being involved in it. The opening scene heist is a great example of this: Baby is happily tapping and dancing to his music until he realizes they're shooting. He watches intently, checking to see if they're injuring anyone. Then again with Redneck Rambo in the pickup truck, Baby is all about no one getting shot. The bleeding truck guard gets to him and then he does everything he can to avoid injuring Redneck Rambo to the point that I was horrified when the guy rolled his truck even though he had no lines and was shooting at our main character for 90% of his screentime.  
  
Every bit of violence committed or witnessed by a character had a profound impact on either how we see them, how Baby sees them, or both -- including for Baby himself. And in the end, it's Baby's own actions that bring about the climax which ultimately ends in him getting his comeuppance and serving jail time. Every action has a consequence.  
  
----------  
  
I could keep going on and on, but this is very stream-of-consciousness and not organized at all, I fear. I'll be damn surprised if anyone actually reads this, but man I could just talk about this movie right on through the character limit of my comment.  
  
As a final thought, though; this is easily my favorite film of the year so far. Edgar Wright is my favorite director and, as an editor, this is particularly outstanding and inspiring even for his films which is saying something. This might be my favorite of his films. It's between this and Hot Fuzz. I'll probably go watch it again this week.",6jxijs

djrw9i7,"I see a lot of debate about Doc's character (especially him helping Baby). so I want to add my 2 cents. I think it all makes sense for this reason: **Doc is trying to curate a new generation of criminals, by helping some and hurting others.**

Evidences: [He kills JD, I think it’s implied that he kills Griff and I would wager he wants to take out Bats after the final heist.](#spoiler) These are all irrational people who kind of suck at being level-headed criminals. (sidenote: I think it’s implied that Doc is prejudiced against people with tattoos. Perhaps because they’re  less classy kind of criminal). Another evidence that he's training new criminals: his inclusive relationship with his nephew.

My point: Doc is training up Baby to be a knowledgable, professional criminal. Moving from the driver’s seat to helping organize a heist is a crucial step. 

All this culminates in Doc helping Baby escape. Why? Because he realizes that Baby is finally starting to think for himself. “I was in love once” is a layered statement. Doc is realizing that by falling in love, Baby has finally learned to think/act/feel for himself. So why does he help Baby? 
Because he wants to pass the torch. He realizes he can no longer control Baby, so he wants to get him safely away from the criminals Doc doesn’t approve of, so that Baby can be a good criminal (good in Doc’s sense of the word: meaning effective, professional).

djmgk4f,"I saw this 3 days ago and posted on here about but I just realized something amazing while thinking about it.

So near the end of the film when Kevin Spacey's character Doc decides to help Baby, they're in an elevator and Doc says something along the lines of ""I hope your foot is comfortable on the gas pedal because that's where it's going to stay for the next 25 years.""  In the final moments of the film when we see Baby go on trial, the judge decides to sentence him to 25 years in prison (with a parole after 5).  This HAS to be intentional, and I just love when filmmakers do cool little things like this.  It's so neat when you can ponder about a movie days later or rewatch it and find something new in it.  I don't know if anyone else noticed this or thought it was obvious but it took me a few days to realize it.

dk8zh9o,"There's something in this movie to appeal to everyone.

The chase scene at start was brilliant and really set the tone for it. 

The musical side of the movie had me blown away, as well as having a very fitting soundtrack, the sound editing had me hooked, who would have thought that simply syncing gunshots could make the movie that much more enjoyable. 

The plot was well thought out but not too complicated, yet still good enough to make it feel like it all had purpose, everything from the reason baby listens to music, to the reason he works for a mastermind thief to the reason he eventually just wants to leave. Everything added up and even the downtime didn't feel like filler just for the sake of making the movie longer, it all seemed believable and made the protagonist kind of relatable.

 I actually enjoyed the romantic portion of the film too, so the chemistry between Baby and Debora had me smiling throughout, even if it did follow the somewhat clichéd dynamic of _boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl really quickly, boy and girl run away together even though they've known eachother for like 2 days._ 

The actors were also a very pleasing part of this film, even the bad guys who you knew were bad news still had a charisma that was brought to life by the actors that made you like them even when you knew they were assholes. 

The action sequences were great. Not slick and hard hitting John Wick style choreography of course, but enough of it to appease action movie fans. 

Even with the fun soundtrack, the drama was still very much present and in a way, was played out very smartly because it had the upbeat track playing in the background even under high pressure situations. (eg. Tequila) and let you feel what Baby would feel in those situations and gives an insight into how he's able to keep his cool.

It was clever how there were hints as the story progressed on Buddy's character (mentions of how ""crazy"" he gets when he's mad; and how he ended up being the ultimate ""villain"" at the end, and not Bats.

djmgu9o,"This was a film that I've always wanted to see.

The idea of someone's soundtrack being the physical heartbeat of the film, almost non-stop tunes playing throughout is just a goddamn dream.

In terms of the humour, I didn't laugh a massive amount of times but when I did, I really laughed, hard. That's absolutely fine by me, it almost feels like its quality over quantity in terms of flat out jokes.

The timing of the sound effects and various background noises to the music is just fucking inspired. Literally had my jaw open during the weapons dealer scene.

Jamie Foxx stole almost every scene, and Kevin Spacey, whilst kinda still in Underwood-mode is still terrific. It's not his fault that Doc and Frank are kinda similar, he kills it as that type of character anyway.

The ending is a bit cartoonish but I think I'd be annoyed if it wasn't just a little bit- even Wright's other films have their fair share of ludicrous moments.

I just love how much attention to detail there is. From the tinnitus rings in the background when the music isn't playing, to the classic TV foreshadowing (again) I'm annoyed at myself for not spotting that sooner.

I appreciate how little backstory we really needed for these characters. Like Baby didn't need some over-reaching origin story about why he drives fast and how he got so good, or why or how Doc got to be a master criminal. Just a few lines and that's it, all we need.

I thought the film was excellent, definitely top-3er for this year, will probably need to chew it over for a few days before I could say if it's the best film I've seen this year but it's pretty damn close either way.",6jxijs

do3e7h3,"I really wanted to love this movie and fully expected to do so since Edgar Wright is one of my favourite directors ever, but for some reason it just didn't click with me, it feels like someone tried to explain to some other random director what makes Edgar Wright movies so special and he tried to replicate it. 

I laughed my ass off watching cornetto trilogy, yet for some reason the only joke i found really funny here was the Monsters Inc. one. The best part about Wright's movies was all the subtle jokes in characters dialogues that were absent in Baby Driver.

I also didn't find main actor nowhere near as charismatic as Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. No character except maybe Kevin Spacey was particularly memorable.

It's not a bad movie at all and better than your run-of-the-mill comedy movie, however i doubt i'll want to rewatch it any time soon.",6jxijs
djkqjlr,"I loved the long takes when the car chases sequences were happening, and how they used the environment to be a part of the songs that played, like parked cars, pillars, and police sirens to go along with the beat. And the second scene where Baby is getting coffee was absolutely beautiful, kind of reminded me of when Shaun went to the convenient store in Shaun of the Dead, where it was just a single shot and everything was timed to the song, I can't even fathom how they pulled it off! I loved Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey in this, they just stole every scene they were in. Eiza Gonzalez and Jon Hamm were beautiful together in a Bonnie and Clyde kind of way, dangerous but genuine affection for one another. And Ansel Elgort, although didn't have many lines, I thought, was a lot of fun to watch, and I think a lot of people can relate to him, in that we like to listen to music while we drive to get us going. And I thought with so many songs that it would put a damper on the pacing, like as if it were an afterthought like it was in Suicide Squad, but it was the exact opposite, it just kept me dancing in my seat while I enjoyed the movie, it's like the Winchester scene while Queen was playing in the back, but the entire movie!",6jxijs

at the end he sees baby with the girl and says I was in love once and helps them he then gives his life to save them. 

He also calls him baby all of the other names he could have picked he called him that.

you see baby's mum n dad fighting all the time could she be seeing doc and had his kid.

He trust his word more than anyone else's

 [I'm also a sucker for anachronisms in movies. So I loved the mid-1900's cultural aesthetic, especially when paired with the kind of sound-coordination this movie had.

dnlx0se,"This movie was so much fun. The chemistry between Baby and Debbie was off the charts for me and I loved it. The synchronization of both the scene and the music made the constant flow of music more seamless and less like a montage/music video where the director throws music into a scene to partly convey the mood they're going for, but mostly to distract and use popular songs to endear them to the audience.

When Baby kills Bats is when the movie started dipping a bit, but I thought the Mom tape paid off in the end and the story wrapped up really nicely. Overall, the ending brings the movie down for me, but I had a great time and it was something you could tell Edgar Wright put a lot of heart and dedication into, because it's on full display once again.",6jxijs
djv1d6b,"First third of the movie: 10/10, one of the most unique, engaging film experiences I have ever had.

Second third of the movie: 7.5/10. Dragged a bit, but had some good moments of tension during the rising action.

Final Third of the movie: 2/10. An absolute tire fire in my opinion, the decisions made by two of the characters which were key plot points in the movie were not properly set up AT ALL. Deborah declaring herself to a life of crime (and a life devoted to Baby) after two coffees, hanging out at the laundromat, and one dinner date followed by him putting her life at risk multiple times took me out of the movie completely. Spacey's character going from blackmail and extortion to putting his life on the line for Baby with the only justification being ""I had a girl once"" (after threatening to harm her when he saw them together earlier in the movie) was really poor. Buddy falling into the trope of ""monologue or delay killing your victim because that's the only way the characters will be able to survive"" felt beneath what the film had set up.

TL;DR: A brilliant, engaging, revolutionary way of editing and directing that is completely derailed in the final third by some unbelievable decisions that ultimately made me leave the theater with a poor taste in my mouth.",6jxijs

     The first is Buddy’s escape from the police shoot out. A police shoot out with a guy with an Assault Rifle doesn’t leave many possibilities for that guy to get away, so clear that he can strole into a diner.
     The second was Buddy’s escape from the cops at the diner. Again, I can’t see how this is possible, this time with a gunshot wound to the chest!

I don't have it but I've been close to being severely effected by it. I've destroyed my ears through many loud concerts and now wear earplugs at concerts or loud events, thankfully I smartened up in time to realize it and save them.

*Why are you wearing ear plugs? Why are you wincing? Are you a pussy? Let's sit by these speakers. That's a loud police siren. Why are you doubled over right now?*


 My ears are now ringing and as well as all 6 friends who walked out of the theater. They felt it! They know what it feels like now! For once it feels like someone outside one of my best friends with ear problems knows it now.

dn6e0ld,"I felt really disappointed with this one. Baby Driver is the perfect example of movie which tries so hard to perfect the form that ends up forgetting the content. Characters are so cliched and there are some lines specially bad. In fact, characters are so basic that two great actors like Ham and Spacey look overacted and incoherent. 

But I'm going further, because I didn't really appreciate the style that much. The single-shot tracking scene of the main character going for a completely irrelevant job is not only lacking any meaning, but uninspiring coreographied too. And if the best you can say about sound desing in a movie is ""the lyrics talk about what's happening in the movie"", I can't see the master work anywhere. 

Granted, it's not by any means a bad movie and it has indeed enterntainment and certain funkie style, but I had so many expectations about the editing of this movie and they have not been satisfied at all. ",6jxijs

It makes sense that Buddy wouldn't be able to compete--although they stress his former interest in heisting cars--but maybe with him also outrunning the cops. 

Like I said, I can't be too upset cause I can't even entirely rationalize why it would happen but I was a little surprised when there wasn't one last dazzling speed burst, especially after so much of the last escape took place on foot. (That was great too though). ",6jxijs

djvmemy,"So I just got back from watching this. Pretty damn good in all honesty. The car chases were simple, brutal, and pulled no punches. The movie had style, and even a rather decent amount of substance for a heist film. And contrary to popular opinion that I've read here, the third act, to me, actually wasn't that awful.

Bear with me here. If anything, it seemed to work in the universe of the story. [Buddy and Darling were hinted at being rather sloppy at their job all things considered, what with the hint at their monologues early in the film. Bats was Baby's foil in his part; with his unhinged murder streak leading Baby to jump the gun on his escape plan. That being said, I agree that the movie did not do timeskips very well; as many people have complained here that Debora's relationship with Baby didn't make sense. The story seems to hint the film takes place over at least a month if not two, (I mean come on, three heists in a week doesn't make sense); but the kinetic editing in the film nullifies any idea of time the viewer could guess. Doc's weird Face Heel Turn at the end had some inkling of a explanation between the lines. It felt like Doc was, despite his success as a crime boss, trying to live vicariously through Baby; sort of as ""the son he's never had"". Cliché, I'll admit, but the appearance of his nephew Sam and the fact Doc always hung around him seemed to point at this. This is why his only explanation is the classic ""been in love once"" deal. Cheap plot point I'll admit, but it actually wasn't sold that bad.](#spoiler) The ending felt rather refreshing (reality ensues), albeit ambigious.

All in all, not a bad movie. I'd say 8.5-9/10. No clue how Wright would make a sequel work though as rumors suggest... Go check it out, it's a good time IMO.",6jxijs

dkrm57b,"The movie finally premiered over here today - can't remember the last time I had to wait this long for a movie, it's been a *very* long wait. It was definitely worth the wait.

There were only like 2 things that kind of bothered me.

* They opened the movie with the best driving sequence. I didn't expect all the driving to be that exciting but I for sure thought we would have an even better driving sequence in the third act but that very much wasn't the case. 

* Jon Hamm's fake death. That was just such an eyeroll moment for me. They really need to retire that trope. On the topic of tropes this movie had a couple of other ones that I think they could've avoided but that one was by far the worst and.

So no major complaints here, was a very solid flick. A little too little Jon Bernthal, I really would've liked to see more from him. 

Unrelated to the movie but one of the speakers to the right in my theatre was broken, which was very distracting when there was loud noises coming from the right side of the screen.

After watching the movie I actually took a slight detour home so I could drive on the highway. Almost drove at 180km/h - I don't think I'm doing that ever again. Car started smelling smoke and it was actually pretty scary, especially since it was almost pitch black outside.

dk6hoo8,"Ok it opened today Australia and I enjoyed it. 6/10. But I was expecting more. I was so excited for this,  The action was pretty good and the robberies were tops. But while the last foot chase was good I wanted more driving. 

Speaking of the driving I was disappointed by the amounts of edits, I wanted some long awesome driving cuts. Like the best shot of the whole movie driving was the first shot of him going backwards, spinning it and the turning towards the camera. That had me pumped, but the weird drift around the reversing truck from the trailer had a big edit in the middle of it, as most shots did, and it took some of the life out of it from me. 

But my biggest issue was the weakness of lily James character, baby's lack of talking and character development and the lack of any real charm or spark in their relationship. Don't get me wrong, lily James looks incredible in this but she's nothing but a trophy. I would say that apart from his foster father all of the relationships were weak. That includes banter, apart from they bad ass guys dialogue I didn't think much else worked. And it was severely lacking in laughs. 

Finally my last issue was with the sound editing and music. I see others hear praising it and I very much enjoyed some of the musical moments. I get that baby has tinnitus but the way the music was mixed, with almost constant high pitched notes bleeding over from one song to the next (to give us the idea of what it's like to have tinnitus) became very annoying very quickly. Also I feel many of the songs were lost behind the car sounds. I couldn't hear the lyrics and enjoy the music, and I know you need a balance cause cars sound cool too. Maybe there should have been more cutting to and from baby's perspective, with the music louder and absent respectively. Another reason they were lost is because of the too cute editing of the sounds (car shifts, gun shots etc) to fit the rhythms of the music. It was clever once or twice but it never stopped!

And finally with regard to music, I didn't like many of the musical choices. Brighton Rock might be an OK queen song, but I can think of 10 better queen songs for a getaway. The old soul music was good, and the brief hip hop, but at least half left me cold. Edgar is no Taruantino.

dk0c382,"It's strange how blatantly Oedipal this movie is. In Baby Driver, the main character, goes by the name Baby thus attaching him to his status as a child throughout the film. His mother is idolised in rose-tinted memories and his key connection to her, such that he is willing to risk his life for it, is a gold-coloured tape of her singing. His object of desire, Debora, looks like his mother (in silhouette, style, and filmic archetype) and have worked at the same diner that Baby is always going to.

His father is already dead, but Baby impliedly blames him for his tinnitus and mother's death and doesn't miss him at all (he only mentions missing his mother, his father was abusive to her, and was driving when the accident happened). Baby then becomes the most skilled driver at the business, thus attaining competence and mastery at the very thing that caused his father's demise, replacing him. Baby is able to escape his resentment of violent older male figures and paternal role models by [killing two of them, Jamie Foxx and Jon Hamm, and leaving his two most explicit father figures, Kevin Spacey and his foster father.](#spoiler) When he achieves his dream of being ""out on the open road"" with Debra, this is when he is simultaneously reunited with his mother, hearing Ferreira/his mother's take on 'Easy' while his dream is brought true. 

Of course, though, this escape can't be maintained for Baby to truly achieve his fantasy. In being arrested and atoning for his sins, Baby is wrenched away from his new mother/girlfriend Debra and becomes unable to see her in person. Her letters to him replace the objectified ""Mom"" tape with a new one (Debra's letters) and his rose-tinted nostalgic memories of his mother are instead replaced with the 50s-style fantasies of leaving and escaping with Debra again, the anachronistic elements, despite looking in the future, an acknowledgement that his dream is still rooted in the past return to be with his mother.

But, of course, Baby doesn't actually just want to become reunited with his mother, or be with Debra in place of her. He wants to go from ""Baby"" to becoming a man, which he does by the end of the movie, having excised the older male figures from his life, returning to his real name (Miles) and having Debra replaced his mother as the woman he fantasises about and longs to be with (i.e. to be merely with her again would fail to replace her entirely - she must become the woman he dreams of being with again).",6jxijs

I didn't know what to expect when I was going in.  I just heard good things about the movie from others and saw a few small out-of-context snippets from the trailer.  In many of the same ways that *Drive* pleasantly surprised me with its neo-noir tone, *Baby Driver* did the same with its hard-boiled, grimy heist story that felt like it was lifted straight from the pages of a 1950s comic book -- even down to the archetypical characters: the quiet Brando-esque protagonist that was caught up in a life that he was too good for, the flirty waitress in a dead-end job that dreams of a better life and is waiting for someone to sweep her off her feet, cartoonish bad guys including a hair-trigger psychopath that makes everything worse for those around him, and a ""Bonnie & Clyde""-like couple whose inseparability would inevitably be tested by the end of the film.

[I was disappointed that Jon Bernthal's appearance is so short, but I won't knock the film for it](#spoiler).

My only real complaints would be the car sequences themselves. [The first getaway was great all though I would have liked to see longer cuts. I figure they probably had to use quick cuts because they were unable to get longer sequences in one take which was a bit of a disappointment.](#spoiler) I also thought the second sequence could have been longer. I still liked them, just a few critiques.

My only real disappointment was the final action sequence. [When Baby steals the Red Challenger (featured on the poster), I figured we were going to get one last chase sequence between Baby, Buddy, and possibly the cops. But instead we had the parking garage sequence which was fine in it's own right, just not what I had hoped for and it left me wanting.](#spoiler)",6jxijs

Same goes for the scene in the warehouse. I felt that it was a decent action flick - I did feel a little cheated by the general lack of chases/high energy scenes involving cars BUT having said that, I felt the part where [Bats is yelling at him to move the car outside the Post Office](#spoiler) was pretty good, definitely amped up the tension.

As a car guy, I was pleasantly surprised by the car noises being mostly spot on (see first chase) and the stunts in the movie being quite entertaining. The soundtrack I found incredible too, really helped sell it along with Elgort's singing along. 

Generally I felt the whole thing was actually pretty good and was a welcome return from Edgar Wright for me. A good blend of action, romance, driving, it mixed all the genres without distilling any of them too much. Maybe I like the ambiguity I felt at parts of the film and that's what sold me, but ultimately I feel it was well delivered and a solid movie. ",6jxijs

I am glad I watched it, and would be happy to watch it again with my wife but it wasn't the 10/10 awesome-fest I was expecting.

djhsgur,Solid film but will definitely be overhyped on this sub. ,6jxijs
dkf0nan,"I thought it was really overrated tbh. The final standoff should have been between Kevin Spacey's character and Baby. John Hamm's character is the only one of the group who is nice to Baby, and takes an interest in his music. He is pretty justified in blaming Baby for his wifes' death, but he's portrayed as the villain? Meanwhile Kevin Spacey threatens Baby and Debra to force Baby to keep committing crimes he doesn't want to, then he has a sudden change of heart and decides to die for them instead. Huh?

Debra was a manic pixie dream girl- no motivation, interests or ambition. Apparently she's been waiting her whole life for someone like Baby to swoop into her diner and save her. Then when she realises he's in a horrible mess of violence and crime, not only does she not leave him, she joins him! Then she waits around at least five years for him to get out of jail so she can fulfil his weird cheesy Freudian mother fantasy.

If I wanted to see an action movie starring a stoic, near-silent blonde young American male getaway driver with great music, I would watch Drive. Baby Driver is the kind of movie that Hot Fuzz made fun of- a silly action movie with weak characters that takes itself way too seriously.",6jxijs
djhr68y,"This has to be one of my favorite movies of the year by far. I love how they blended what Baby was listening to with the actual scene. The romance between Debroah and Baby was really well done too, though I wish they would have gotten a extra scene or two to flesh out their relationship more. The action was really well done and that opening chase scenes with the cops was amazing. 10/10 would definitely reccomend. ",6jxijs

It would have been so easy to just have him be the bad heartless mob boss but the way he broke convention and came to Baby's aid based on his own past was brilliant on both Edgar Wright's and Kevin Spacey parts. On Edgar's part it shows that the characters he created are much more fleshed out, making the world feel more authentic, that their lives started before the opening scene (something stressed by all the characters especially by Buddy) and I don't think it could have been conveyed as effectively with a less talented actor.] (#spoiler)",6jxijs
djhzsu3,"Just came out of the theater and wow was that spectacular. You know a movie is good when you realize your smiling like a child in a candy shop during the movie. The editing on this was soooooo beautifully done, words cannot do it justice. Edgar Wright is a genius, and I can't even imagine the work and effort it took to sync almost every shot to the sound. Shots that in most movies  are there just because thy have to be, like a character closing a door, means so much more here as it contributes to the flow of the film. The story was great, the exposition tastefully done with a great plot and an awesome conclusion. Can't wait to see it again. ",6jxijs

I know he does the same trick in The World's End and Shaun of the Dead, so I was trying to catch the trick here. I know the Monsters Inc. quote became relevant and I'm pretty sure he changed to a channel where someone says that they have to finish the job on foot, which also ended up becoming relevant.

The attention to detail is what really intrigued me. You can literally feel Edgar Wright's passion for film-making bursting through the screen. Loved the action scenes, soundtrack, and cast. But I think the story could have been better, and I really disliked the ending. I feel like it was about 15 minutes too long. ",6jxijs
djud331,"Hugely enjoyed the movie, great music. But I found myself disappointed by two main things:

-lack of Jon Bernthal. I loved his character, and thought they were setting him up to be the antagonist. But then he disappears 15 minutes in and we never see him again(I guess he died).

-car chases were underwhelming. Considering car chases are basically the premise of the movie, I was expecting a little bit more from them. They were certainly well executed, but there was only like two of them and neither had any super impressive stunts. I wish the final showdown had been a chase rather than in the parking garage.",6jxijs
djv1efi,"The TL;DR of the review is basically that I really liked it, though it didn't honestly feel like an Edgar Wright movie, seemed like a watered down ""*mainstream*"" version of one of his movies. Acting was all around good and the editing was lovely. Overall I'd say 7/10.

Onward. I finally saw this movie Tuesday, and this might hurt my review but the theater I saw it in I think they forgot to kick up the speakers. It just wasn't loud like a theater should be, which I think must have made some of the music disappear. Because there was entire chunks of the film where there just wasn't anything going on for the score/soundtrack.

Namely in the middle, which I thought was the big drag of the film that hurt it the most to me. This movie starts off as a fun car chase and heist type film, and then we get to this diner and the movie grinds to a complete fucking halt to start up a different movie all together. Suddenly we're in a coming of age teen romance movie, not a heist movie. This wouldn't have been a problem if such a large chunk of time didn't suddenly disappear into this void. 

Outside of this though, such as the opening scene and the scenes involving the actual robberies. The editing of the music and peoples' actions and scene events was remarkably well done. It was this editing I came to see and thoroughly enjoyed. Just wish there was more of it. I kept hearing hype/reviews about how great of a car chase type movie this is and there just wasn't nearly as much car chasing as I was lead to believe. Especially the ending which didn't involve a car chase, but a parking lot push-struggle. I thought they set up J. Hamm, maybe I misheard his dialogue, but I thought he said when younger he dabbled in driving. So made me think we would be getting a spectacular cat mouse chase between the two. That didn't happen. 

And the ending with Kevin Spacey sacrificing himself? Why? They clearly set him up as **not** being a father figure to Baby but rather like an employer that is exploiting an employee. Suddenly because Baby has a girlfriend he's going to put his life on the line and sacrifice himself to save this guy that he has been exploiting for personal gain? It rung really hollow and I thought that could have been handled much better. An unwitting sacrifice rather than a deliberate choice would have been far more appropriate. 

Though that is a small hiccup, as is the slightly disappointing ending fight sequence between Hamm and Baby. But those weren't enough to hurt everything else that was pretty solid about the movie. I've heard others didn't like Jamie Foxx but I thought his performance was fine enough, I enjoyed it for what it was. Forgot her name, but Deborah was charming and fun, liked her performance. Hamm was the star of the movie IMHO, as honestly I just didn't like Baby all that much. Didn't hate him but he just didn't really sway me. His mumbling style of talking didn't help either. ",6jxijs
djzsdl5,"I thought the movie was alright, but I didn't like it was much as the ratings would suggest.  I did not care or feel any chemistry with the couple.  It sure seemed like Baby was able to stop that last job from happening and went along with it why?  I love old music, but none of this music connected with me.  It just seemed off that Baby's musical taste was that of a middle age nostalgic British guy.

Jamie Foxx was great thought. ",6jxijs

dk70sq8,"I thought this film was an impressive work of technical skill that also managed to entertain on a gut level, which is always a potent mix. The editing and choreography was next level, which deserves its share of kudos, and the cast was game. Loved Jon Hamm in this and felt his character really earned the turn that he took in the third act.

One aspect of the film that deserves more notice is the level of suspense that the viewer experiences when you know the songs. The scene with Blur's Intermission, for instance, had me on the edge of my seat because I knew what direction that song was going to take. It goes up Up UP UPPPPPP until it crashes hard. Logically, the scene would follow suit. Sure enough.

Now, as far as the relationship at the center of the film is concerned, I saw Debora's character not so much as underwritten but as a purposeful archetype. She isn't so much a trophy as a key to a life of personal satisfaction that Baby could never experience in childhood or adolescence. He hadn't lived through any degree of normalcy for so long that a life on the road with this really hot girl he barely knew must have seemed appealing to him. Debora was a device, a means to an end that offered him a fresh start of sorts and he fantasized about it in those highly stylized, monochromatic cutaways toward the middle and very end of the film. 

As far as Debora's side of this is concerned, some people are just boring. They live in boring places, lead boring lives and any excuse to break out of that malaise is enough for them when a guy like Baby rolls through their lives. I totally bought the premise of their relationship, even if I knew it wasn't built to last. She was just vague enough as an individual to make running away with her seem almost reasonable. Get to know her too well and the element of surprise disappears. ",6jxijs

Everything was just so well done here. I'll likely go at least one more time while it's in theaters. I wish I didn't watch all the trailers though, it felt like I knew what was gonna happen in a lot of scenes. Until the last chapter anyway. I really liked the change of tone towards the ending too.

What they did with music synchronicizing, music choice, and the majority of the way the movie was shot was quite amazing to behold and I enjoyed that tremendously.

Especially when they had some heavy hitters as actors. Kinda weird.

But based on the poll, I see I'm in the minority here. I didn't hate it by no means and I'm still processing and deciding on how I feel about it.

Maybe it was written fine and Spacey just didn't sell the relationship to me, dunno.

djiwa8x,"My wife took me to see this as a birthday surprise (we have a 4 month old, hence the idea that we got out of the house was most of the surprise) and we've been talking about it all day.

One thing that we both surprisingly enjoyed were the action scenes, lately we've both been suffering from a sort of ""Action Nausea"" where we just want the fight scenes to be over, something I think comic book movies are responsible for. Because Wright put in an aesthetic of his own, and likable characters that were constantly in peril, there was actually substance to this.",6jxijs
djjh1d4,"Not a lot I can say that won't be a repeat of the hundreds of other comments, but holy cow was that a good movie! All of the emotional and comedy beats landed flawlessly, except Debora's quip about ""So not a chauffeur... noted,"" which might be literally the only piece of dialog in the entire film that didn't land for me. 

The scene with Baby, Bats, Buddy and Darling in the diner is the most intense movie scene I've seen in a long time. The shootout raised the stakes, and turning what was once a safe and happy place into a potential catastrophe was a brutal reversal that sent my heart right to the floor. 

Jon Hamm was absolutely horrifying in this. Great rendition of the unstoppable pursuer archetype (like Chigurh in No Country For Old Men or Malvo from Fargo season 1). I had only seen Hamm in a couple of wooden comedic roles (such as his arc in 30 Rock) and Mad Men, so I'm glad this movie proved his phenomenal acting in Mad Men wasn't a fluke. 

Kevin Spacey nailed every line as usual. His character twist at the end was amazing. It was unexpected but didn't feel cheap because we never really knew much about him other than he did like Baby. I love when a film makes you go back and reinterpret past scenes, and I'm still sitting here replaying all of his scenes with the knowledge of his last moments. 

I could go on forever. Honestly one of my favorite movies now. The music. The wonderful incorporation of sounds with the soundtrack. The ending which was satisfying without being patronizing or cheapening the tension. I'm sitting here buzzing nearly an hour after the film ended. 

Oh! One more thing. The laundromat scene was so charming. The energetic camera, the blocking, the wonderfully cheesy-but-emotionally-honest dialog, and the genuine chemistry between the actors. This felt almost like a scene out of a musical and really helped to cement the love connection without which the whole movie would've fallen flat.

Hopefully anyone reading this has already seen the film, but if you haven't, go see it!",6jxijs
djk3zsz,"Fun little diversion of a movie. At times it seemed almost like a musical, the way the characters movements were choreographed, not just Baby's dancing. I'd give it a solid B+",6jxijs

djlknyv,"Just came back from watching it. It was alright. This movie is excellent in all the technical aspects right down to sound design. It is one of the best edited and directed movies I've seen in a long time. The thing that makes this movie not as enjoyable to me is the protagonist's character or the lack thereof. Sure, he has his quirks, he wants to do the right thing, but I found his character to be pretty boring. I found Jon Hamm's character more intriguing than Baby's. Every scene with Bats(Jamie Foxx) was pure gold. He brought the unpredictability and tension in te second act and to me, it was far more enjoyable than the final act with Buddy and Baby.

djpcaai,"I really loved this movie and can't wait to rewatch the shit out of it.  
  
Edgar Wright is really a craftsman at heart as a filmmaker. Everything in this movie is precise from the intro, the sequences, the editing and the sequencing of the music.  
  
Honestly, my initial impressions of Ansel Elgort from other movies was that I didn't see it but he really showed it with this film especially the facial expressions and the vulnerability especially in the scenes with his deaf Foster Father who he deeply cares about and wants to keep him safe. You want Baby to make it and listen to his music.  
  
Lily James is just adorably hot and Eiza Gonzalez criminally hot.   
  
Foxx and Hamm, they were the best performances of the film. 
  
Jaime Foxx when he has a great script with a great filmmaker (see Mann) can really own a movie. I loved how Batts is menacing and yet so understated at the same time. He is not a cartoon, he doesn't scream nor does crazy gestures. He is also not a coldhearted cyborg either especially that scene at the diner when he figured out who Buddy really was in his past, very real and scary  
  
And wow with Jon Hamm, at first you completely think he and Baby will ally later in the movie when it's clear Buddy likes and respects Baby then when Darling dies, he just turns into a vicious killer. I don't think another actor could have pulled that off like he did.  
  
Kevin Spacey was good also but he is pretty much this generation's 'Gene Hackman', he will always give you solid performances and I wasn't really bothered like others when Doc helped Baby at the end. There was enough foreshadowing and hints, Doc really liked Baby and the fact he didn't let Batts and Buddy kill him for the audio tapes and even let him back in the heist  
  
I also liked Wright's homages to Walter Hill and hard-boiled action movies of the 70's and 80's. Even the fact Buddy's real name was 'Jason Van Horn' which is inspired by Clint Eastwood's longtime stunt double, Buddy Van Horn.
",6jxijs
djpjb6i,"Obviously the music and editing was on point especially the details. Not too much 'in your face' humor nor did it feel forced. I did feel iffy on the pacing of Baby and Debora in the beginning but I believe when Buddy searched for Baby while saying 'Romeo' it finally made me realize the likeness of their short affair. 

I was somewhat dissapointed that Baby was caught in the end and thought that they had the potential to become the next Buddy and Darling of sorts. Like others said, the movie certainly had weight and consequences to it. I guess a shitty take on the ending would be Debora pulling her mad driving skills out of nowhere or they would dramatically die in each others arms. Thankfully, this was not one of those movies. Overall, I quite enjoyed it and holds a high place in my favorite movies this year by far. ",6jxijs
djpmuy7,"Oh, Jon Hamm and Aiza Gonzalez are one hot couple in the movie. Would love to see them in a prequel.",6jxijs
djppm7d,[deleted],6jxijs
djrixno,"One part I had an issue with in the moment of viewing was when the postal heist broke down and Baby was parkour-ing out of it. Once he was separated from the other robbers I felt he didn't have to make himself so visible by running. He wasn't armed, police likely less worried about him but would have interest as a witness (then connect the dots from the sketches).

But while the shootout is going on with the 2 others and the cops, he just has to get out of sight and GTA-style wait for the stars to die down. Get new clothes like he tries in the mall but I just don't think the cops are as focused on chasing him when he wasn't armed and could play like a hostage.",6jxijs
djrvgtp,"The first half of the film was pretty fantastic. I wasn't a fan of [turning Buddy into the main villain at the end. They spent so much time setting up Bats as the real baddie, that they wasted him literally and figuratively too soon.  He was even set up as being targeted by Buddy and Darling earlier.  I think it would have been fantastic if Bats caused Darling's death and in the end it was Buddy who helped kill Bats and freed Baby to get away and have what he wanted, the love of his woman. ](#spoiler)",6jxijs

djy4kgm,"Baby Driver is my favourite film this year. As Edgar Wright is my favourite director this shouldn't surprise me but what a flick. The humour, music integration and characters were outstanding but all I could think of is how different (in a lesser way) this movie would've been if Wright didn't direct it.. makes me appreciate his art so much more. So many things wouldn't have happened and there would've been less weight in the action scenes. Loved this movie so much.

If anyone has a google play subscription and is confused, like me, as to why the movie's album is missing 25~ songs (even though all the songs are available through google play's library) I've made a playlist with every song in the official playlist.

djr7uqf,"Super conflicted about this one. On one hand, it's a really well-shot, well-edited movie with all the cinematic tricks and quirks we've come to expect from Edgar Wright, a killer soundtrack, and great performances all around, though I think Jamie Foxx was the best of the bunch here. 

On the other hand, the screenplay itself is a mess of plot holes and almost obscenely out of character behaviour. A prime example of this is when Doc has JD killed for dropping a gun, but leaves Bats alone despite gunning down an entire team of bent cops. And I don't really buy Doc's change of heart or the flimsy handwaving the screenplay tries to justify it with, nor Buddy suddenly trying to channel Anton Chigurh when the way Darling dies is almost completely her fault, for spraying and praying at a bunch of cops with no cover in front of her, nor Baby and Debora's relationship moving as fast as it does, to be honest. Other people have said this is the movie they expected Drive to be, but honestly this is the movie that I'm glad Drive wasn't.

Overall, it was definitely a good time at the theater, but the movie just falls apart the more you think about it. Great popcorn entertainment, but, if I'm honest, that's about all it is.",6jxijs

djjk5l5,"There were so many things that I loved about this movie. Wright's movies are all about the details. I feel I need to see this a few more times just catch all the ones that I missed in the first viewing. 

The details I did like from off the top of my head;

I loved how the overhead cityscape shots mimicked Baby's musical equipment. 

I loved how Baby's scene of walking through the city the words everywhere be it graffiti, flyers, signs matched up to the lyrics.

I loved how the real threats to Baby were either wearing red or bathed in red. While those who were on his side wore shades of blue. Doc seemed like a threat to Baby but in the end he wasn't, hence you didn't see him in red. 

I loved the catch and you'll miss it [Wright's Mint Royal music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfrcZsKcVxU) blip flashing on a screen in the background. The video was ground work for this movie. 

I loved the not subtle visual clue that Baby was going to have to descend into hell and defeat the Devil before being free with him going down in the elevator and having to face Buddy who was bathed in red light and looked like Satan, himself.

I loved the musician cameos even though Paul Williams pulled me out for a second and made me wonder what sort of rainbow connection did Edgar do to get him in the movie. 

Also, did anyone get any Han Solo vibes from Baby? At one point he was wearing an outfit that could have been a Han Solo cosplay. ",6jxijs

dk0z3wu,"I'm bummed people in this sub are disappointed in this movie. I thought it was very fun and stylistic in classic Edgar Wright ways, but still showed his growth as a filmmaker.

dqwco1v,"Personally I didn't like how JD was killed, yeah I get it, he showed incompetency, but it was sort of minor in the grand scheme of things and the job was still done and they still got their payout. To me, he was just more of a vocal version of No-Nose, they should have offed him too. To justify killing JD, they should have showed a much more severe mistake created on his part. For an example, the car they picked out, it should have been filmed where JD was responsible for getting it but he fucked with the car and it ended up breaking and causing them to barely dodge a bullet by switching to another vehicle.",6jxijs
hzlcfek,"A fun and entertaining movie overall with great editing and supporting cast but I didn't like the lead's love angle or Doc's ""I was in love once"" line. He went from threatening Baby to forgiving him? He basically serves an abusive father role by threatening to get rid of Baby's old man and Deborah, but then offers him better housing, faith and trust in his squirmishs with other gangsters but the final scene with Doc took me out of it. Felt like his turn came out of nowhere but even worse, it felt super forced to redeem him.

The ending overall didn't bother me because it felt like a fantasy more than a reality. It felt like it's up to the viewers if that happened the way it appeared, so I'm at least ok with that.",6jxijs
dqpa9c1,"He's kind of a shitty getaway driver. In the opening scene he could have just driven away casually. The cops weren't on to them until he started driving backwards, speeding, and drifting with every turn. He does this a few more times when casual driving would have worked better.

Super hyped about it 6 months ago.

djkrxaq,"Still not sure how I feel about this. I liked it, but didn't *love* it. I think the mistake I made was thinking it was going to a little more humorous like Wrights other films. I'm glad to see he's able to hold a more 'serious' film. 

John Hamm was awesome in it and the way they involved music into the scenes was fantastic. Even the shootouts was in time to the music if I remember correctly. ",6jxijs
djle0rz,"So you know that magical cinematic experience you get when you go into a movie knowing absolutely nothing about it; but as the film goes on you realize it's gripped you and won't let you go? And before you know it you're really enjoying yourself, despite going into it blind? That's what I was fortunate enough to experience with Baby Driver today. I felt like a kid in the movie theater again; and that's a pretty hard feat for a movie to pull off these days.

Literally the only things I knew about this movie going in were that Kevin Spacey and Jaime Foxx were in it. Everything else was a mystery that slowly unraveled to me and I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.

And honestly you could say I came into this movie with a bias; because I absolutely loathe car chase scenes. They normally bore the fuck out of me and I can't wait for them to be over so we can progress with the storytelling. However that was not the case at all here. The action so well shot and synced with the music that I didn't feel distracted or bored for one scene of this movie. I actually felt legitimate suspense. 

The cinematography was fantastic, and I loved the way they incorporated the music into it too. It could've came off as super corny and it felt like it was going to be that way from the start, but as you get to know Baby the music sequences just fit the character so well.

The cast all performed well, some better than others, but for the most part they had great chemistry. [Jon Hamm stood out as the unexpected villain (maybe it was predictable, but it caught me off guard).](#spoiler)

This was just such a fun summer movie. It's an action heist but it's also a love story without it feeling like a forced subplot. The music selection was fantastic. I'm really surprised with how much fun I had with this movie. Perfect summer flick and without a doubt worth seeing in theaters. Everything is shot so well and smoothly, and it's not a typical run of the mill action/driver film. The characters are in many ways cliches but I feel as if that was done purposefully. There's real emotional substance to be had here.

Literally the only complaint that comes to my mind right now is [that I don't understand why or how Baby's ear(s?) healed so quickly. I thought Buddy shot his ear off on purpose because he wanted to take away something he loved, AKA the ability to hear music. Also Debora of course. And on top of that you could add that he conveniently escaped the cops many times when there just seemed like no possible way he should have lol. But if you suspend your disbelief during those moments it's negligible.](#spoiler)

It just put into perspective how much they liked one another and how in sync they were down to the foot tapping. Once it went outside of that realm it kind of took me out of it since at times it became a little unbelievable that she'd bolt that quickly or wait 5 years for a guy she knows. The only way I can frame it is that they're just two young kids who were orphaned very young and never had a chance to grow up really.

Aside from that it was a really awesome way to incorporate the music into the movie with some really tense scenes to add to its action. All of the major players did their job really well to give this movie some footing. I gave it an 8/10 on the poll but would definitely check this out again.",6jxijs

djimxwq,"First off, I love this movie. From its masterful editing to its sharp wit and beautifully choreographed action, I could sing its praises for hours. I did have a few issues with it though. Spoilers below.

I think the climax of the film could have stood to be a little tighter. Someone in my theater let out an audible ""OH, COME ON!!!"" at the moment where Buddy comes back after his car falls off the parking garage, which echoed my thoughts as well. I thought he was dead after he got shot in the diner, so to have him come back not once, but twice, verged on absurdity.

Also, I had issues with the character of Debora in the final act. I could buy that she would be in love with Baby after not knowing him that long, and I could even accept that she'd be willing to run away with him. In that final battle in the parking garage though, it just took a lot of suspension of disbelief to accept that she would be so cool headed in helping Baby fight off Buddy in that situation. How quickly she went from waitress to action hero was jarring.

Lastly, and relating again to the length of the film, I didn't think the epilogue with Baby turning himself in, the testimonies, and him getting out of prison were necessary. There was one throw away line like ""You can't keep running away from your problems"" that lead up to that decision, but I didn't think there was enough character development there to make that moment where he decides to stop running away feel impactful at all. That Debora is waiting for him when he gets out of prison took me out of the film as well, in thinking ""Did she really wait for him for 5 years?"" I think I would have preferred just to have them drive off into the sunset as the lesser of two cliche evils.

Again though, these are just a few minor gripes of plotting and characterization in an otherwise superb film.",6jxijs

The shot choice was impeccable, the language of Ansel's acting and the closeups on him during the chases are more and more meaningful after we learn more and more about his character each scene.

I also loved the little touches, like Baby holding his hand to his pulse and running in sync with his heartbeat when his iPod got shot away. I'm sure that like Wright's other films, there will be tons of easter eggs and hidden treasures when we go back and watch it again.",6jxijs
djlf5ga,"I was thinking about why baby decides [to go the lawful path](#spoiler). 

[One of the things that was repeated a few times in the film was that if Baby started to go down the path of a criminal, things would escalate.](#spoiler)

[This movie is clearly a lot about love. Other than Baby and Debora, two other characters were in love. Doc and Buddy. Both of them are deeply entrenched in the underworld. Baby sees Buddy lose his one true love due to complications of a heist (that Baby caused, but whatever). I think when Debora was going to try to speed past the cops right before he surrendered, he became afraid that Debora would get caught up in everything and she would suffer the same fate as Darling.](#spoiler)

The opening sequence took advantage of the whimsy in an interesting way, but after that I felt like the style fell by the wayside. The characters and world didn't feel real, which isn't a problem, but something about the environment felt ""off"" more than it felt stylized, like it was straddling 2 different genres without doing either exceptionally well. Including the volatile Bats character in a heist supposedly orchestrated by a meticulous, hands-off criminal mastermind also didn't make a lot of sense to me.

dnzv2r4,"i loved this movie, it was great and an experience

the worst part about it is 1 scene at the end... the final battle with buddy

that scene was fucking so terrible it honestly seemed straight from a b movie

spoilers ahead since spoiler tag doesnt work, great!!!

baby pushes buddy's cop car off of the parking garage, while barely dodging bullets fired directly at him (this is like the third time he does the same near bullet dodge, this guy has serious spidey senses) and then luckily buddy gets out the last minute (which is nonsense, we would have definitely seen him get out!! he had less than a second and the camera had the cop's driver seat in view the whole time), so he can pull some serious emotional manipulation like:

making baby's tinnitus awful (Which i guess gets resolved at the doctor later on? why did buddy even shoot out his eardrums in the first place if he was gonna kill him, or i guess he was just gonna kill his girl instead? why did the plan change? idk its nonsense)

and then finally he gets shot in a bit of a clusterfuck of a struggle, while the girl dramatically peers over the edge and the car explodes

that scene felt so out of place and didn't even feel like the same movie, it genuinely felt like that scene came straight from a shitty action movie

other than that nearly everything in the movie was a masterpiece",6jxijs
djj8kyw,"The only major thing I didn't like was how Jon Bernthal and Jamie Foxx's characters could have been the same person and not much would have changed. I get that Doc said that he never uses the same crew twice but that much pretty much goes out the window when he ends up using 3/4 of the same crew for the very next heist.

I loved the little foreshadowing with Bernthal's ""If you don't see me again, it's cause I'm dead."", and how they didn't true to redeem Jamie Foxx's character. I also loved the bait-and-switch, with Doc being a good guy and Buddy being a bad guy by the end of the film. ",6jxijs
dlvsbi4,"Finally watched this yesterday! I've been dying to watch this movie because the trailers just hooked me in. With that being said, I'd give Baby Driver a 7.5/10. 


I really wanted to love this movie more than my expectations but idk. Something was either missing or off.


The entire movie was fun and entertaining, the bits where the tinnitus was heard when Baby didn't have the headphones in or how the ""beat"" of the scene matches with the beat with the soundtrack were very, very kool, I don't think I've seen a movie that's done that before.  



Also throughout the movie, I got the subtle vibe of a 50's-ish (oldies?) theme that I really liked. Examples such as Baby and Deb's love interest; some songs from the soundtrack; the names of Doc, Buddy, Darling and Baby; Scenes of Baby's parents; the black and white scene of Deb; and the whole ""let's drop everything and drive away"" schtick with Babe and Deb. 


Everyone played their part well and Jamie Foxx's character was such an unlikeable guy, I loved how he delivered his character. 
I also loved the interaction between Baby and Joseph, they were very sweet and hilarious. 


The only gripe I found with Baby's and Deborah's romantic flow is how Baby flakes on her real early in the morn and Deb doesn't give him shit for it lol well that can be justified that she's really understanding and patient with him I guess. 



The ending was alright. Action, tension, and relief. Kevin Spacey's character's final bit was eh. I can see why others were upset with his decisions near the end. 



After writing all this I realized that the opening driving scene was so well done that I think it spoiled the rest of the movie for me. I expected the rest of the heist drives to be just as good or better. The getaway scene with Jamie Foxx and the shotguns was enjoyable though. I think that's what I wanted more out of Baby Driver: a lot more awesome driving scenes. Hell, I thought we would've got a scene with him and Deb driving about when they first started talking.



Overall, I really enjoyed the movie and I think my high expectations is what made me want more out of Baby Driver. A very fun and exciting film. ",6jxijs

dkysydq,"This movie was the worst should have been good movie I have seen this year. 

The storyline was vague and at times didn't make sense. The main character wants and needs changed constantly. 

Character development was shoddy and rushed. I wish I could have gotten to know bats more. Or understood Darla and Buddy's relationship more than the few screen shots where they are hanging on each other. In a way that I could understand his pain of losing her or why she was so willing to commit cop suicide if she was just as interested in escaping with her lover.

The continuity between the characters also had me perplexed. It seemed like everyone was trying to act like everyone knew each other and we're closer than they actually were.

I could be complexly off mark with this and maybe I am missing the point. But I came away confused, let down and wondering, what the fuck is up with all the monster inc. lines??",6jxijs

djhskpx,Best music video I've ever seen.,6jxijs
djjsnvc,"Exceptional movie, but was about 15% short of a masterpiece.

Things I Liked:

- An amazing color palette. Extremely similar to La La Land. Lots of uses of saturated reds, blues, yellows and greens. Baby always wears a blue jacket, and drives blue cars. Bats always wears red. The colors in the washing machines at laundromat.

- The anthemic/music video/rock-opera camera movements, sound synchronization, and modification of reality/time.

- Kevin Spacey. Always kevin spacey.

- Generally good acting.

- Excellent chemistry from all the leads, but especially between Baby and Debora.

- Sound design so sensuous I heard a woman beside me literally moan during one of the action sequences. She was murin the subaru engine noises.

- Interesting reversals and some solid reveals.

- In camera, meticulously choreographed, balls-to-the-wall car chases. 

- Use of wonderful and non-stereotypical musical selections. Thank you so much Edgar Wright for not using Imagine Dragons, Bohemian Rhapsody, or anything from Suicide Squad.

- Super creative transitions. 

- Good use of villains. Unsure of their feelings, intentions, loyalties.

- The Nephew. That fucking nephew.

- Amazing but subtle costume work.

- Superb casting. Don Draper is under utilized by hollywood.

- The line about both his parents dying in a car accident, then only quietly saying he missed his mother, was a nice touch.

- Some killer dialogue with subtle nuance. A few The Wire/Departed little things that could be easily overlooked. 

- Monsters Inc.

Things I Didn't Like

- Some emotional jumps in the characters were plot driven, not character driven. (Bats is too nuts for Doc to use, Doc lacks trust in baby despite being the most reliable of the main characters, people don't seem to want to take cover during a fire fight?) I know the movie is, effectively, a fairy tale; but in those moments lose immersion when a bad guy just stands and shoots.

- Some plot points were contrived. After dozens of jobs with no mask, no one knows Baby? Why does Baby [show up to the last job, if he's only going to sneak away from the last job?](#spoiler) Why would Doc not tell his goons all the details of the meet? A few others.

- Why did they kill Hat so early? He had the best line in the whole fucking movie.

- Characters aren't managed as well as other Edgar Wright movies. The bullying of Baby by everyone, is just forced. It makes no sense in the context, and simply serves to create artificial drama. Babies relationship with his foster father needed more depth, and the main villains could have used a bit more time doubting, second guessing each other, or changing sides Reservoir Dogs style to really get our investment and curiosity. The ending was predictable the second Don Draper glares at Baby when he walks away.

- THE BIG ONE [Doc and Baby's relationship was more complicated than the movie explained. Possibly that Doc had a wife, and lost either his wife or his wife and a child. In the elevator he says he was in love once, but its flat out of nowhere. Also, he always has a ton of child's toy cars at the meetings, something that is never explained. Since they aren't used in his presentations, and he brings like 30 to each meeting, I think it has some significance. Like this is his way of playing with Baby. I think Doc had a mentor mentality to Baby, and he wanted Baby around because he liked himself just as much as his talent. His willingness to defend him in the end, share his emotional past, and give him money, is all implied in that. But it comes out of fucking nowhere, after threatening to murder everyone he cares about...?. I think there was more explanation, but it was probably cut from the movie.](#spoiler)

- The Ending. Totally pulled a punch. Felt it deserved a Catfish/Bonnie and Clyde/Thelma and Louise ending. However, the rainbow at the end kind of felt like a hint of Edgar Wright saying, ""The studio is making me do a happy ending, fuck you here's a rainbow.""

- Some weird pacing sprinkled in throughout.

- Flashbacks were serviceable, but so fucking bog standard. 

- Some wasted dramatic opportunities that were either filmed and cut, or just missed. I think the former.

- Needed more Nephew.

I really liked it overall. There was a slight whif of studio stink on some parts of the film, but I thought it was a triumph. And was soooooo close to being a classic, just missed a few marks. Excuse and grammer/word stupids. Movie got out at 130am.",6jxijs
djnu3ym,"My favorite movie this year. The action, comedic relief, and utilization of music were all on point.

djr4k14,"I love this movie so much. When I listen to music I love, I picture it as the soundtrack to a scene in a movie, and it was so cool to see that Edgar Wright clearly does too. The way music syncs up with everything is fantastic, and Wright again manages to cram in a ton of little easter eggs and in-jokes. My only criticism is the ending, which I felt like dragged on a bit. I feel like having Buddy chase Baby in cars would have been more exciting than confining the action to a parking garage, and I really was just waiting for Buddy to die by the end of it. Also I'm not really sure what the point of having Baby go to jail is if you're just gonna gloss over it with a 30-second montage before showing him get out. Even with this, Baby Driver is the best film I've seen all year, and may end up being one of my all-time favorites.",6jxijs

- especially the bull/matador scene 
- similarity between Bats and Baby's Dad and Debbie and Baby's Mum
- Flea from RHCP making an appearance 
- Griff being murdered off screen presumably by Buddy for looking at Darling funny
- painted wall of a car on a highway being in Bo's diner and a postcard of the diner and of the painting posted to Baby by Debbie
- probably more that I'm forgetting at the moment!

djofgvp,"Baby was sang by the girl that worked at the diner...where Baby's mom also worked, and she too was a good singer, hence why he'd be called Baby cause she sang it all the time. 

Baby took care of his Foster Dad who was deaf and had to feel the vibrations of the music...as did baby at the end of the movie. 

Kevin Stacey's nephew was blonde and was attached to his headphones, and was alert to spot out all the things in the bank, that sat in the bar middle seat...as did Baby during his flashbacks, who has ninja like alertness but might have been slowed down a tad bit after the crash, flash back the recorded track on he's a bit slow. Similar to the earlier B-A-B-Y recording

Doc and Baby were a team, Baby was his lucky charm, Doc ended up saving them, Doc once was in love...Baby once was in love before he got sentenced to prison. 

Jamie Foxx resembled the dad...yelling threatening, more on the violent side...ended up dying in a car crash as everyone was yelling at the driver

Edit: Buddy was Baby in love with Deb when they were together, both Baby and Buddy got mad at the diner when Foxx kept digging into their personal lives. 

When Buddy's girl (I'm sorry I'm blanking out on her name) dies, he loses it, he goes back to the diner in which they had met.

The cast was great, direction was great, but the story felt lacking and, even though the soundtrack was great, the syncing of the soundtrack with the movie became a little gimmicky for me.

djirckk,"The only point that felt really off for me was Kevin Spacy's change of heart at the end. It seemed out of nowhere. Usually in an Edgar wright movie, there would be clues to set up a payoff like that, but there was nothing for that in this movie. I would have been completely OK with it, had at one point in the movie, they had one line mentioning Kevin Spacy's character ever falling in love. But they didnt, and so it felt so out of place to have this calm, calculating, self obsessed character turn into an altruistic guy willing to sacrifice his life.

He's pretty much the catalyst that drives the third act of the movie, but all of that comes down to ""this guy is crazyyyyyy! See how crazy he is!"" Buddy and Darling back him up (for some reason) when Kevin Spacey confronts him about it. Spacey (for some reason) is swayed and goes through with it.

do0hkgb,"I tried going into this movie being positive, although i've never been a huge fan of Edgar Wright. The movie felt quite promising for a while, the chemistry between Baby and Debora was great. I loved how Baby, even if shy, kinda just went for it and didn't hold back that he was interested in her. So many movie romances are just two caricatures of perfect human beings trying to outromance each other, the bad boy trope, or your typical super awkward dorky guy gets the girl. Baby had this cockniness over him when talking to Debora ""You are so beautiful"", ""I'd like that, too"" etc. And she was very responsive and open as well, which i liked. Very cute little romance.

Some of the humor hit, the heists were fun, some interesting characters, so far so good. 

Then somewhere around the arms deal the movie started to become a convoluted mess. ""Stop here"" ""No stop here"" ""we're doing this"" ""we're not doing this"", Jamie Foxx's character was a bore, no interesting dialogue and it just felt a bit all over the place. Also as i said i enjoyed the first half the movie , but there's problems ""sprinkled"" around all of it.  Bernthal's character being one of them. I get that he was suppose to be a warning of sorts to Baby about things to come, but his character got too much screen time without really doing anything that interesting, so it felt very weird when he was left out, like they were building up to something more with himm. If he made more of an impact during his time, or played more of a fun little ""cameo"" role it would have been better. 

The film kinda found it's footing again during the last heist (which should have been the final act, during daytime , i mean). The scene where he drove straight into the truck killing foxx was great, the intenseness when he lost his airbuds and was just running, feeling his heart beat, great stuff all of it. 

But then it just went on and on and on forever. What was the point of the emotional goodbye with his step - dad when the climax is just gonna be baby's going to jail? They'll see each other every weekend. The car battle was ridicolouse, why exaclty did he have to ""finish this""?  The guy was already half dead and the cops would have gotten to him. I did not buy kevin spacey's change of heart either, felt very cheap and almost cringy ""i was in love once"", totally unbelievable from the guy that just a couple of scenes ago threatend to make Debora ""not pretty"". 

The idea of having baby ultimately pay for his actions and all his small deeds helping him a bit in court was a nice touch and tied it all up well enough. I wouldn't really mind that ending if the set - up was a bit better, but the way there was so messy and with the way things went down I almost think it would have been better simply having them drive off to the sunset in an exaggerated and romantic Bonnie & Clyde style. 

great potential, disappointing movie. 6/10.

djipyq6,"If this film doesn't get nominated for the best editing oscar, I'll give up on the academy once and for all. ",6jxijs
djjtat6,"Saw it last night and I really enjoyed it. 

I wasn't expecting it to be as musical as it turned out to be. It kept reminding me of La La Land in places, in how it felt very retro though seen through a modern lens. A lot of Guardians of the Galaxy as well in how music is Baby's link to his mother. Edgar Wright is clearly someone who has studied cinema going right back through the decades, Baby Driver feels very classical - a 70s style story about bank robbers and heroes within this criminal world, but also very 50s in the portrayal of an innocent romance between two young people clearly perfect for each other. At the same time, it's all these things but it just feels so modern. The fact that Baby has all these ipods filled with music from the last century rather than an iphone subtley conveys just how out of time everything kind of is.  

There was almost an OCD mentality to how the editing and visual beats matched the music. So much planning must have gone into this film! Though I think remember watching the making of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz the levels of planning in the visual details were calculated from an early storyboard level. 

The music worked well for the action sequences but even when Baby is walking up and down that street to get coffee after the first heist things are happening. It obviously reminded me of the scene in which Shaun goes to the shop oblivious to the zombie outbreak around him. Shaun is kind of oblivious because he has a hangover, Baby is in his own world but just kind of lost in the music. It demands a second viewing maybe some record keeping to log every beat.  

I'm convinced that even in the quieter moments when the music has been quietened down into the background that the onscreen action and dialogue is still being influenced by it. Once the movie is released on DVD, I'm sure all the video essays is going to reveal even more mind blowing stuff and attention to detail.  

The dialogue reminded me heavily of Tarantino, it was very cool and perfectly encapsulated the mood of the characters. Jamie Foxx in particular was really menacing. [Though I really wasn't expecting him to be the big bad for the end of the movie, was expecting Jon Hamm to be the 'good' guy.](#spoiler) Ansel Elgort is a straight up superstar, oodles of charisma - somewhere in between Steve McQueen and Zac Efron. 

La La Land used it's retro sensibilities to lull you into this false sense of security in the expectation of this big happy ending, but in the end you get a suckerpunch as the two lovers decide they have to be true to themselves as two very different creative people with different ambitions and goals. Baby Driver doesn't have this, unless you want to believe that [the ending, in which Baby gets out of prison to meet Deborah is just a dream, like the one shown earlier](#spoiler). 

I'm not sure if Baby Driver is as layered as Hot Fuzz, The World's End or even Scott Pilgrim, but then it usually takes a couple of viewings to notice everything that is going on in Edgar Wright's movies. You tend to pick up new things with every viewing. It's part of the fun of watching his movies.  

For the moment, Baby Driver seems to be about:

* I guess I read it as a kid forced into a life of crime, who is kind of lost in his own head as a means to deal with all the horrible stuff he is linked to as well as his tragic history that he has perhaps not come to terms with. 

* It's also a coming of age tale, in which the Baby must grow into a man, within this world of bad guys, by accepting the love of a woman and atoning for his past sins - I guess by giving into all the sentiments expressed by the music he listens to. 

* Like an actual baby, Baby himself is very innocent with this innate sense of moral good. He obviously has to get out of this life of crime, since very clearly it distorts everyone who becomes too wrapped up in it. In some ways the other bank robbers he encounters are versions of what he could become. Jamie Foxx is obviously the darkest extreme, who threatens to take what he wants when he wants. Jon Hamm immediately comes across as the friendliest of the bunch (he's literally called Buddy), offering him advice at the start to not answer Spacey's phone calls. They bond over a particular Queen song and he generally doesn't question the way Baby is. But then, he has his own world to escape into - with his passionate romance with Eiza Gonzalez's character. [When he loses this, he loses control completely and has nothing else and so becomes evil incarnate](#spoiler). Because Baby is so 'good', this is why he [chooses to go to jail to atone for his sins, to do his time without his beloved music.](#spoiler)

djkmzrd,"I liked it. Didn't love it, and kind of disappointed by that. Maybe I hyped it up for myself too much. 

Watched the entire Cornetto trilogy for the first time this week and was absolutely blown away. But Baby Driver was...good.

**The good in my book:**

Sound editing on point. All the stuff matching up to the music was awesome. 

Action scenes were great. I wish there had been a little more, because I felt the movie dragged a bit before really picking up for the exhilirating car and foot chases.

Performers were all fantastic. Elgort was really entertaining (and a hell of a dancer), James was cute, Foxx was crazy, Hamm was a fantastic friend and for, Bernthal was great in his small part, and I've got a giant crush on Kevin Spacey. 

Humor balance was pretty good. It was a 1:40 show on a Thursday so my theater was empty, so I don't know if it was the fact that there was less audience energy, but there were only a few big laughs and you definitely could tell this was more action than comedy. Still, there were plenty of great moments. 

Doc as a character was great. Same with Buddy and Bats. Buddy's transition from being Baby's only friend to being the big bad was believable and well-read, and the diner scene was great. 

**My issues:**

Baby didn't really have much of an arc. He's fun to watch in the scene but he didn't really...change throughout, and it was a little hard to care for him. Same with Debora -- compared to Wright's other work (I'm thinking The World's End, my favorite, in particular) the big emotional moment where Baby gets caught didn't really feel earned.

Pacing was off, imo. I think the movie meandered a little as it went through the lovey-dovey stuff before getting to the big job, and I was waiting for the payoff. Maybe that was my expectations ruining my experience, because people had the same complaint about Hacksaw Ridge, whose love story I didn't mind.

I felt it was a little...forgettable. I'm sitting here in the car typing this out 15 minutes after the credits started rolling and I'm having trouble remembering much to say about it one way or another. 

Overall, I'd say it was a really cool movie with a lot of really cool moments and worth the 10 bucks I paid. But it's not a classic in the way that I've come to expect from Wright, which is fine because it was clearly focusing less on story and humor and more on showcasing a more visual/musical style.   ",6jxijs
djmhgjv,"Man this film was INCREDIBLE. I just got out of the cinema seeing it and there's a good chance I'm gonna see this movie again because it just was that good. I feel like it's gonna become one of the classics, the cast was great, the sound was great, the music was fantastic and for the most part there was a decent level of character depth despite that most likely being the weakest part of the movie. 

I really hope this movie wins some sort of award for sound/music because man it was (I know I've already said this) INCREDIBLE.

Literally the only negative that I have from the movie is that Lily James (the actress for Deborah) doesn't have a Twitter account that I can follow :(

djnpccg,"Just going to word salad some of my thoughts because I just got out of the theater, spoilers warning obv:

* Was that Killer Mike talking with Kevin Spacey at the restaurant? Also, Paul Williams cameo made me super happy.
* Felt like 1/3rd of the movie was a music video (not complaining)
* Amazing song selection, but I was a tad disappointed Radar Love's use was so short. I was hoping for that/Highway Star and was super pleased when it came on, but they didn't really utilize it so that was sad.
* The timing of the sound effects and background noise to the music is AMAZING, and by far the best part of the movie. Obviously in full display during the opening coffee scene, but I couldn't get enough of it during the gunfights as well.
* Ties in to the last point but the little details are incredible. Deserves a rewatch just for those. My favorite was after Baby drives on the little wall thing to avoid the military dude, and you see ""Perimeter Banking"" right after.
* Felt like the middle dragged a bit - a lot of the time when Buddy, Darling, and Bats are with Baby I was like - ""why is this happening?"" Didn't make sense logically but obviously a lot of exposition and buildup.
* Jamie Foxx kills it, best actor by far in the movie IMO.
* I was waiting for Debora to be like ""whoa I just met this guy a week ago, I'm out.""
* Don't know if it's to the movie's credit or detriment, but I legit had NO idea where it was going in the final act. Pretty much everything after Bats gets killed I wasn't fully expecting.
* Was expecting a bad ending, but I guess I should know with Edgar that he only does happy endings.
* Super funny in the first third but lost a lot of the humor by the end. I laughed pretty dang hard at the HAT line and ""Fuck your baby.""

Overall it was just super enjoyable. Edgar Wright special where you can just turn your brain off and enjoy, or also go in with a fine toothed comb and look for all the details. ",6jxijs

I personally felt the third act dragged, that Wright wasn't as confident putting his foot on the pedal as it were. So much was snappy and quick, it felt strangely dragging in other places.

For instance, there's an EFAP about doing visual comedy right that points out how in Hot Fuzz Wright doesn't rely on just B-Team skyscraper shots -- he did exactly that here.

dki1rjr,"This is the best music video I've ever seen.

Not a great movie though. I wouldn't have thought this was an ok movie if I had bought the tickets because it the disappointment I felt would have just made me hate it. 

Prior to watching the movie, I knew nothing other than it's supposedly a good movie. I probably forgotten about the 100% rottentomatoes score and never watched the trailer, so I went in with a pretty open mind.

Then the sitting in the car while the bank job was happening. I found that long and boring until the car chase, then noticed how you can't do some of the things he pulled off. Like 80mph on a local street then pull that tight corner. Maybe if there was more road, sure. But the chase was all tight and short distances. At this point, I knew it wasn't the movie for me.

The characters are one dimensional with no development and some break consistency. Baby is consistent in that he doesn't emote and is super blank. Debora is the pretty prize the hero gets at the end of the hero's journey. Bats is supposed to be bat shit insane. Doc is supposed to be this criminal mastermind, and you see his intelligence in planning and the execution of 2 heists. Then he chooses to have Bats on the team for the big score? I get the other two. They work well with Baby. Bats was brought on just to be a plot device to fuck shit up. He doesn't have a particular skill set needed for that last job. There's trust in the couple for their part, but they could have replaced Bats with any grunt and it would make more sense.

When the plan goes to shit, due to the super obvious foreshadowing by putting Bats on the team, it's Bats fault that Darling dies. I get that Buddy would see it as Baby's fault, but Bats is the monkey wrench in this plan from the start. And that diner scene? Pointless exposition of an unreasonable conclusion someone could draw from another.  Doc relenting to Baby? There's no prior development to justify why ""I was in love once"" is the reason Doc helps Baby.

This was a music driven movie. And it's a very well done one that I could enjoy if I just turn my brain completely off. Those were the best parts of this music video.",6jxijs
djsqj3z,"Edgar Wright single-handedly revitalized film-making for me. He is among the maybe... 3 people out there I can watch their films and be told, undeniably, that there are still creators out there. There are still people who give a shit about their craft and care about the *details* and the *hard work* of making a movie that go beyond, ""oh let's grab some actors who have a fucking hashtag on twitter right, slap their faces on a poster and call it a day"". Edgar leaves no stone unturned and you can tell he fights every moment during his process to get the best product he can get. He is my fucking hero and I love him.

...which is why it **FUCKING KILLS ME** to have to admit that Baby Driver was lacking for me. I didn't walk in with incredibly high super expectations about some kickass blow my face off movie; rather I walked in there with 100% certainty that this movie woudl be perffect.

and it just.... missed it for me.

Don't get me wrong, you should see it and it's still fun, but this is not the Edgar Wright I know and love (at least not past the first 2 kick ass scenes). Let me try and explain.

Wright's movies, to me, embody complete control, over absolutely everything. No one says anything, unles Edgar wants it that way. That napkin on the table over there waaaayyy out of focus? Edgar said put it there. The camera moves this way and the sound hits on that beat because he deemed it so. We are visitors in a world that *Edgar completely created and controls completely*, and furthermore, we know it because it comes out so well on the screen.

Until I die I'll never forget the amazing camera movement in Edgar's TV series ""Spaced"", where there is a character who is never seen, ever, yet he communicated so vividly the idea of a spoiled teenage girl running out of her room and slamming the door, with just a moving camera. (I'd link it but I can't find it)

Years later something similar would happen in Scott Pilgrimm, where Knives answers the door and SCott needs to make an ""escape"". The camera is doing a lot of work, and that is a HARD shot to do.

But that's Edgar. He takes control and says to us, ""this is what I want you to see and this is how I want you to feel""; details *matter* and we love him for it.

And I did not get that feeling from Baby Driver. That didn't feel like Edgar's world; it felt at times like Edgar was being controlled by taht world and he and the characters just kinda went, ""eh OK I guess I'll deal with this""

[Kevin's Spacey's character makes a big fuss about how ""it's my job to know everything, Baby, that's how I know about that cripple taking care of you""; yet somehow he doesn't know the track record of this insane guy (Jamie Foxx) who's MO is to pretty much kill every one he meets and shit always goes south? Hey! Let's pair you up with the cops that busted you last year! That's won't piss you off I'm sure! By the way, Baby, if you don't do this job, I will fucking end you, your life, your friends and everything you care about, so don't come waltzing in here having just killed half my crew with some dumb puppy dog look on your face bec- oh your girlfriend is here? I guess all is forgiven then. Have a nice life, I guess I'm not mad anymore](#spoiler)

That's just one example (and maybe, I admit, a too personal, nitpicky one), but throughout the movie I kept finding myself going, ""I'm not *with* you man, *take* me there.

djqude1,"Loved it. Wright has perfected his style over the years and its really payed off here. Such a delight to watch and I just can't wait to go back to see it again.

Edit: I'm going to see it again tomorrow, can anyone tell me when Killer Mike and Big Boi are in it? That somehow passed by me and I did a double take when I saw their names in the credits.",6jxijs
djqzbq4,"Just got back from the movie and I'd say it's pretty good. I would like to throw a (pretty weak) explanation for Doc's change of heart. It obviously left a lot of you guys confused (including me) when this cold, hard-ass, professional gave Baby money and told him to run.

But when I was watching it was pretty obvious the exact moment Doc took Baby's side, and that's when he saw Deb run in and tell Baby to forget the tapes. IIRC, it's at that exact moment when Doc abandons his stubbornness and lets Baby take the tapes.

Then, later on in the elevator, Doc said something along the lines of ""I was in love once too"" or ""I know what it feels like to be in love"". I don't quite remember but it was something like that that suggested he had a sweet heart once.

So it could be Doc's past love life causing him to sympathize with Baby. Again, this seems pretty weak since it was practically never mentioned but it's something. Maybe the reason Doc wasn't so sympathetic earlier at the fancy restaurant was because he didn't realize how close the two were. Maybe Doc realized how truly in love the two were when he saw Deb appear at the end, showing that she had stuck with Baby even after all the shit he had been through. Hence, the sympathy through ""being in love"".

Also, seeing Kevin Spacey go ham with a shotgun was pretty badass, so I'm not complaining.",6jxijs

djyjv0h,"The best film of the year so far. These days, when blockbusters are so predictable (sequels, prequels, common universe), we get a stylish and orginal picture. ofc I can't forget about a music. A lot of directors pay attention on soundtrack (Refn and his ""Drive"", Gunn, Chazale), they use music as another way to express emotion and climat of scene. Wright walks the same path like above creators and I hope major studios will be support their ideas. ",6jxijs

dndzq9x,"Fantastic movie. I love the use of colors, the use of red in particular. One thing I didn't like was Doc saying he was in love once. It felt forced, though I did appreciate that he helped them because why the fuck not, he's going to die anyway. 

Oooh and I'd like to mention the diner scene with Jamie Foxx. I flinched when Bats stood with his gun out. Scared the shit out of me. 

Last, Buddy was the unexpected villain. I saw Buddy as this dude that Baby would have become if he escaped with Debora. 
",6jxijs
djnxl9q," 7.1/10 (spoilers ahead)

A great *original* action/driving movie. Something that's becoming too far and few in between. This movie excels in technical direction. Sound/visual editing and cinematography are the best features of this film. Lots of long takes featuring Ansel Elgort, he and his stunt crew handle them excellently. He has great potential as an actor to be a consistent box office success. I look forward to seeing his next few films.

Edgar Wright has a great eye for visuals and he nails it once again in this film. The soundtrack choice was excellent, with the songs perfectly matching the pace and feel of Baby's emotions.

The last 20 minutes of this movie did not do it for me. It's murder diarrhea, combined with inexplicable behaviors by of some of the characters. Having Kevin Spacey suddenly become empathetic and soft towards Baby when he's been nothing but ruthless throughout was a copout. To have him die for Baby because he was once in love doesn't make any sense. 

If there's one trope I can't stand is the indestructible villain. Jon Hamm gets killed like 3 times. I felt like Jamie Foxx would've been the better character to have a big fight with since he and Baby have had a few confrontational encounters.

Overall, it's a great popcorn film that is Imax friendly. Grab your snacks and enjoy a good, but somewhat jumbled, thrill ride",6jxijs
djhs1s1,The background noises being synced was so well done and something I've never heard before. The movie was a 7/10 but the music pushes it to a 9/10 for me. Also Bats was bat shit crazy and legitimately made me feel tense. ,6jxijs
djhs9ul,Awesome movie. The guns shooting off along with the music was eargasmic.,6jxijs
djhsibw,"One of the best movies I've seen this year. It was like a two hour music video. Despite the modern technology it actually felt like a 1980s film because of the color pallet and cinematography. As always Kevin Spacey is excellent, and Jon Hamm is a fucking riot!

Any time a song came on, every thing was choreographed perfectly. Conversations, gunshots, doors closing, people walking, even facial expressions were perfectly on beat. The combination of this choreography and the fantastic editing was jaw dropping. This is my favorite movie of the year so far! ",6jxijs
djhzdy1,"So, when I first saw the trailer, I was super happy with all of the music editing and sounds syncing up. I showed it to some folks and had them check it out on this basis.

dji75h1,"Saw the movie last night and I can't decide whether I enjoyed the characters or the way the movie syncs to the music more. For such a simple plot the little twists work amazingly.  From Bats the seemingly biggest threat being offed almost instantly, Doc making that slight hero turn and Buddy turning into the big bad.

And dammit Wright is great at the little touches in his films. The way Baby interacts with his foster dad, and watching how he reacts to violence really sell you on his character.  And just writing this I really want to go see this movie again.",6jxijs
djidlv3,"It seems I liked it a bit less than most, but I still liked it quite a bit. The movie is a blast and generally well-crafted. 

Pros:

* The action is great. Not over-the top  but suitable. Shot clearly.
* Wright's typical use of environment to tell you things (walls, TV) is cool.
* Paced well. No drag.
* Funnier than half the comedies I see, without really trying.

Cons:

* Some of the music choices didn't convey the spirit of the moment imo
* I wasn't sold on Doc's sudden willingness to help Baby after Baby crosses him, particularly when Doc had already seemed to willing to harm him.
* I didn't understand the def man's character. Who was he to Baby? Why did they live together. Why did he matter so much to Baby? He seemed to have this emotional weight but for no reason and no end. Please tell me I missed something.
* Darling's character was so over the top hot I couldn't but her as the criminal underground.
* The ending. ",6jxijs

djihci0,"Man, this movie was just so freaking great. Loved how ridiculously stylish it was while never sacrificing its characters or story (was not expecting so many twists and turns!). Really appreciated how the stakes never felt unrealistic. If someone's life was in danger, you felt like that character could actually bite it. If a character was at risk of losing something, there was a very real possibility that they could have lost that thing. 

And on a more personal level, I LOVED seeing this as a Georgia boy. Seeing Atlanta treated the way New York City is usually treated in movies (with great familiarity, expecting the audience to keep up when it comes to names, streets, locations, etc.) was SUPER special for me. There was so much attention to detail when it came to setting. High points of this feeling included...
     -The Atlanta Journal Constitution.
     -30% of thunderstorms? Literally every summer day in GA.
     -The meteorologist on the radio is the real meteorologist on 95.5,

I loved the twist/reveal of Jon Hamm being the main antagonist; it felt really human of Spacey's character in the third act to be like ""fuck it, I'm done anyways, might as well help out this kid who's in over his head,"" and Hamm going nuts made sense for a guy who was in it for the thrills rather than because it was necessary , who then actually lost something.

But the black dude was like nah we got this. And doc asked baby if he thought it was a good idea ""time to make big boy decisions"" 
2nd time was when doc said to bring baby home and find a new driver. Baby insisted on being on the job.

Just putting great music over disjointed car chases doesn't make a movie or a compelling story. And yet this lazy approach to film making seems to be the norm.

I'll admit to being old and having seen many movies over the years. Which is probably part of my problem. Baby Driver doesn't break any new ground and what it does cover is completely contrived. Finally, how many times can Kevin Spacey play the exact same role type? Answer: as long as people keep going to see it :)",6jxijs

It had a good build up and the beginning was great, but after Jamie Foxx's character died the movie kept trying to climax over and over and over and it was way too long. 

I did not like the movie at all besides the driving scenes, very disappointed. To eaches own. I'm glad some people loved it!",6jxijs
djkhxio,"Alright, I guess I have to do this: I did not like this movie.

The writing was cringey at best and straight up unnatural at worst. It felt like this half the plot points the movie starts never get developed. There seemed to be like 4 or 5 different reasons Baby listened to music all the time and not one of them was fully developed.

The music was supposed to be an important piece of the plot. It was just distracting. Not only was it not even recognizable music, a lot of the time it wasn't incorporated into the scene in a way that made sense. It was probably the worst when Buddy is confronting Baby at the diner. Baby is still listening to music that hardly goes with the tone of the scene. It doesn't help set the tone of the scene, nor does it effectively contrast with it. It's just there. I feel like 9/10 of the songs should've  been replaced with an actual bit of a properly orchestrated film score.

On top of that, this movie just felt devoid of Edgar Wright's signature style. I expected this to be an action comedy movie, but it's not even funny. Even in a superficial way, this movies comedy consistently fell flat. The Mike Meyers joke that I laughed my ass off at from the trailers felt boring in the actual movie. All the hallmarks of Wright's visual comedy aren't there at all. There's a couple zany transitions, but you'd have to keep an eye out for them because they don't do anything for the actual story.

That's not to say I was completely disappointed. I liked most of the performances even if they were performing as poorly written characters. Kevin Spacey was a constant hit. Movie needed a little more Jamie Foxx and a little less Jon Hamm. A more appropriate name for Jon Bernthal's character would be Godzilla because he's on screen for like 5 seconds even though he's really good while he's there. 

I actually stayed for that post credits scene. Consider this an official complaint about the description. 

Wanted to like the movie. Did not. Tale as old as time. See you after Spider-Man.

So far its one of my favorite films of the year. I still prefer Hot Fuzz, The World's End, and Scott Pilgrim, but this is still a damn good film, definitely worth the price of admission. Although, be warned...this isn't really a comedy...its more of a light action thriller with comedic elements. It definitely isn't as laugh out loud funny as any of his other movies, but I don't think its trying to be anyway. Just come expecting that rather than Hot Fuzz 2. I give it a solid and incredible score of 8/10.

djl7ymn,"This film was a masterwork in lampshades. Edgar Wright manipulates so well using iconography, cues, beats. The character you expect to pull a heel-turn and be the main badguy actually turns out to be cool. The biggest threat goes out first. Instead of a double-cross at the pizza shop, [there's a quirky delivery scene](#spoiler). I kept noticing nods especially to Drive (the Mike Meyer's masks, the elevator scene, the pizza place.) Really it defies every expectation at every turn. Astounding.",6jxijs
djmqxty,"Saw the movie couple days ago, but I could never understand why baby didn't agree to cancel the last heist where bats killed all those cops. Baby seemed to have every reason to want to call it off, and then ride into the sunset with Deborah. I mean, even doc was against going for it.

Am i missing something? Anyone care to enlighten me? ",6jxijs
djn18v7,"I enjoyed all the driving scenes but it was a bit much for Kevin Spacey to threaten him and his girlfriend and then all of a sudden decide they're all friends and he's okay with dying for them as long as they get away. It seemed like *he* should've been the final showdown rather than Jon Hamm. The whole finale kind of killed my suspension of disbelief. Still fun to watch though. 

Also Jaime Foxx was too evil. We get it. He's the most violent. It would've been nice if there was a little more mystery about who's going to mess up the plan. 

It felt like a musical where no one sings but there's still a choreographer named in the opening credits. That works great in the car but the scenes where they meet-cute and their laundry date felt off. Maybe it was the performances or the timing but it felt too fast and too expository. 

I can not get over how much the actress playing his girlfriend looks like season 1 Twin Peaks young Mädchen Amick. 

It's definitely a goofy jazz riff on 'Drive' but it has so much fun with the premise it does so much more than just remix another movie. 

And that Kid Koala track kills: Was he slow?

djoxm6z,"I know it seems a little bit too nit picky, but everything in the movie seemed pretty possible. Except the ending. There is no parole in federal prison. When the judge said 25 years I thought that was awful for Debora and Baby's romance plot. Then he said with a parole hearing in 5 years and I was just thrown off by how possible everything in that movie seemed (e.g. robberies, high speed chases, etc) but parole in federal system is non-existent. I doubt Wright meant for that inconsistency, I think someone involved with the film just assumed it so. I guess that will just be chalked up to errors on the film's imdb page. ",6jxijs
djrbnwu,"Great movie overall! About everything is solid, from the plot, acting, stunts, and especially the use of music! There are a few small problems with the film such as...

[The character witness scene at the end, I'm sure the men Baby stole the Red Challenger from, would have some strong words for the judge](#spoiler) and [it seems like Baby is gonna skip parole with Debora](#spoiler). But these are minor complaints, and detract little from the movie besides a break in logical immersion. 

The only real issue I have is [with the love story itself. Debora was totally willing to accept and love a guy, who turns out to be a felon, who has it in him to kill, all within a few days, just because he's a nice guy. Sure she must not have had a lot going on for herself, as much is alluded to, but still it's kinda hard to swallow.](#spoiler) Though this has nothing to do with the acting, which was good throughout the movie!

djvrkim,"I loved this movie, the music, the editing, and the performances, especially from the supporting characters, where astounding, but there were a couple things that rubbed me the wrong way, many of these, in my opinion, arose in the final act of the film.



Most of them have been brought up, but the one that I haven't seen yet is [when it came to final heist, Baby was theoretically in the clear once everyone got into the car, as escaping from police pursuit could be easily accomplished. So why did he suddenly decide to botch the entire robbery for no apparent reason, other than the fact that the situation reminded him of his Father's and Mother's final moments. He would receive a full cut of the money, it's assumed Bats would be killed by Buddy, (making sure Deborah is safe from the person who is most likely to cause her harm), from the conversation Buddy and Darling had while Bats was getting gum, and there'll be a cool down period between this and the next heist, possibly giving him more time to get away. All he had to do was get them to Doc and everything would've worked out in his favor.](#spoiler) 



Another small thing that bothered me is [the fact that it's mentioned that Baby has been the getaway driver for Doc's crews over the past ten years. That seems like an extremely long period of time to be a getaway driver who's disguise is simply a pair of sunglasses, to be constantly evading arrest. This also brings up another contradiction which is when Doc says he only works with a crew once, so why is it suddenly that he brings on people for a second job, with no real explanation or reason, other than the fact that these are the main members of the crews that the audience has previously seen.](#spoiler)



All in all I really enjoyed this movie, I'm just somewhat disappointed about the ending. For what seemed like such a well put together movie to begin with, to me, became a string of weird plot holes towards the end.

I didn't feel like there was a lot of screen time wasted, but Debby was really not part of the story which I kind of disliked.

The first thirty minutes were like Glee, extremely awkward white guy wiggling around poles and stuff. Sure a character can have fun, but this is the same character whose an unsocial straight faced shutoff, nothing else about his character would make me see him doing that which is what made it weird. The story died without any hint at continuing for about twenty minutes while he and his girlfriend had these stupid flirting session and went to a fancy dinner to just pull weird faces at eachother. I HATED that everything was timed to music I thought that was so hokey and cheesy, the noises never ended, the dialogue had zero meaning for like Half the movie, there was a ten minute scene where he meets up with John Hamm and Jamie fox the first time they're all together to review the new job and they just talk about their cool music jams they'd drive to and it does basically nothing for the movie other than fill time and make Jamie foxx look like an annoying bully villain that a 13 year old would imagine, not someone cold and scary, just kinda laughable, and just like half of what they talked about in this film it was empty dialogue or came across weird. They didn't develop the girl along with the story, they had to completely stop the story to spend time on her and have these cute talks where she's all over him for some reason so that you would feel worried later when there is danger - that is a HUGE peeve of mine. I thought Kevin spacey was gonna break his legs? Suddenly he's helping them, giving them more money and dying a dumb death for helping them which was already out of character too?

I liked the cinematography, the lighting - especially with the cop lights at the end with John Hamm, Kevin spacey with the monsters inc thing, this acrobatic camera guy who followed everything, and the little kid. Fuck they should have just made a movie about he little kid.
Otherwise This is like deadpool all over again for me, just cringe for a few hours and everybody on reddit loves it.",6jxijs
dk9e31j,"I was a tad bit disappointed after seeing all the raving reviews for the film. I went in with high expectations of a film that breaks all sorts of genre conventions and found myself watching a film that's entertaining but not necessary worth remembering for a long time.

The good: The character of Baby was unique and interesting, Ansel Elgort and Lily James were charming 
The bad: Several plot holes, Kevin Spacey played a Frank Underwood",6jxijs
djjhma6,"I thought this movie looked soooooo stupid when I first saw the trailer for it, like a ""trying too hard to be smart"" version of Fast and Furious.

djjtc1j,"So Baby goes to prison. When we see him leave to meet Debora, the scene begins in black and white and fades to color... I took it as dream sequence of sorts, akin to the ending of *La La Land*.

Very cool. I wonder how many people completely missed that though. ",6jxijs
djonry1,"The musical gimmicks are cute but that doesn't make it a good movie.

Baby and Deborah are cute together but as far as plot goes there's very little here. You go to all these lengths to establish Doc as the antagonist just to have him randomly turn around and help Baby at the end of the movie. He suddenly has a change of heart? Then Buddy, who seems kind of friendly towards Baby, suddenly goes insane and tries to kill him? What's the point of all that? Plot twists like that, just for the sake of plot twists aren't that meaningful.

And as for the driving? That was the thing I was most looking forward to and I ended up being disappointed by it. You go on about how little to no CGI was used but then the driving sequences look like they were cut together by Michael Bay. Not a single shot was held long enough to demonstrate the ability of the drivers. But there's cool music playing in the background so that makes it good?

I'm gonna be in the minority on this one.",6jxijs

djj8kan,"Really wanted to enjoy this, but just didn't click with me. The main actor was upstaged by everybody else - even Sam the Nephew. Pretty much the entire film was built around music and chase scenes, but I didn't feel one scene came close Shaun of The Dead's killing-the-zombie-landlord-to-the-tune-of-Don't-Stop-Me-Now. Even Inception used music better. 

I don't know. It felt like the SotD had a ""fuck it, just go with it"" tone that worked really well, where as Baby Driver took itself way, way too seriously. 

It was like an OK Go gimmick applied to Drive, with Ryan Gosling's am-dram understudy as the lead man.

I would rather have watched two hours of Jon Hamm, Kevin Spacey, and Jamie Foxx back-stabbing each other to Egyptian reggae. They were fantastic. 

The flirting in the dinner? It was literally 5 minutes of the two characters spelling their names and talking about obscure songs - that's not character development, that's not chemistry, that's an awkward moment from Girls, at best. 

Baby was so affected and his character was painted with such thick strokes ('his Mum - who was a SINGER (!!!) died - EMOTIONAL BAGGAGE (!!!) - in a CAR (!!!) accident!) that I really hoped he would get done for speeding and the adults could get on with the film without him. Edgar Wright directed this as if emotional depth was a burden: 'look I've given you a sepia toned flashback to Tragic Character Forming Event #146 and given you hints at Object With Emotional Weight #765 - can we please get on with synching doors slamming with snare drums?' 

Imagine Edgar Wright hadn't directed this. Imagine Hott Fuzz and Worlds End and SotD didn't exist. Would anyone in their right mind consider this a masterpiece? ",6jxijs

djjiguw,"Gonna go against the grain here and say that the movies dialog and overall tone was both jarring and cringeworthy. Was it fun? Yeah, in a its so corny its hilarious kind of way.

Spacey's characters' line ""I was in love once too""? yeah okay, no way that kid wasn't getting a face full of shotgun for even showing up at the HQ after the bullshit pulled.

All of the criminals are caricatures of what I imagine a highschooler thinks a criminal is and does. Bats character is laughably bad. I did however, enjoy the the couples characters and performance.

And lets not forget the entirety of Deb and babys romantic interest essentially being about less than a week long. 

I don't agree with the general consensus of it being ""brilliant"", but nonetheless, it was fun to watch.

Edit: I don't like your opinion, so I'm going to downvote you. Stay classy reddit.",6jxijs
djj0xu7,"I was quite disappointed really.

The film just wasn't very funny. I think back to how hilarious Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz was. Even The Worlds End had laugh out loud moments. I don't remember any moment giving me anything more than a slight chuckle.

The characters weren't great either. Kevin Spacey was suddenly very caring at the end even though he threatened to kill Deborah and break Baby's legs if he didn't continue to work for him. Jamie Foxx was irritating and Jon Hamm was some sort of Terminator at the end.

I don't think it nailed the comedy and drama balance well. The tone felt really erratic and the story suffered because of it. Everything kind of fell apart near the mid-point of the film. Baby was making really confusing decisions after being pulled back into working for Doc. 

Also, is it just me or were the police really incompetent in this film? Baby and Jon Hamm managed to evade the police for the entire time after the botched heist. How on earth did Jon get out of that police standoff at the car park?",6jxijs
djnkepp,"I'm not going to say it was a bad movie, but it wasn't a great one either.  I was quite frankly bored for much of the movie and really expected more.  I feel like this film is receiving a lot more praise than it deserves solely based on the love for Wright's other films.  ",6jxijs
djtg9ts,"I'm really surprised at the crazy positive reception this movie got from the critics.  I thought it was a cool, thoroughly entertaining film, but basically nothing more than popcorn entertainment.  Fun to watch, but I completely forgot everything about it 10 minutes after it ended.  The characters were weak, the story got dumber as the film went on, and there really weren't any standout scenes.  I would probably give it a 6.5 out of 10 if forced to rate it. 

And while they couldn't be more different in tone, I couldn't help but think of Nicholas Winding Refn's far superior Drive when watching this.  ",6jxijs
djnrjn7,"I just got back from the theater and I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was perfectly entertaining, but not great. 

The good: The editing, soundtrack, and direction of the action sequences were all perfection. The supporting cast (Spacey, Foxx, and Hamm, in particular) were all excellent. All three do menacing + funny exceptionally well. I also thought Eiza González was good as Darling. 

The bad: I will probably get a lot of disagreement here, but I wasn't a huge fan of Baby's character. I couldn't quite tell if it was a problem with the way the character was written or the actor himself, but he came off as cocky rather than charming, and way too smooth considering the life he has had. He had no arc and I don't feel like I really knew who he was or why I was supposed to care about him. He was okay when he wasn't speaking, but every time he opened his mouth I found myself getting more and more irritated. 

I get that Spacey has a soft spot for the kid, and I buy that he would let him leave with the tape and some money. I do NOT buy that he would take the fall or sacrifice his life for that kid. No way. It didn't make any sense and that story point annoyed me. 

There's no way the getaway driver in multiple crimes that led to the death of cops would only get 5 years. No way, no how. I don't even see the point of showing him going to prison and then getting out--the ending just felt awkward to me.

The romance between Debora and Baby feels really rushed and contrived, her character is a stereotypical damsel in distress with no real agency, and the ending is hollywood fantasy.

Big contrast from always having a pair of sunglasses ready to be worn.",6jxijs

When she found out he was a criminal, shouldn't that of made her, idk, want to run away from him.  They had only gotten together only a couple times and I feel like she barely knew him.  It didn't make sense to me for her to see passed the fact that he hid a pretty big secret from her, and got her into some pretty dangerous shit.  Maybe one or two more scenes of them together would have sold their relationship a little better.  Like really, she waited 5 years for someone she barely knew to get out of prison?        ",6jxijs
djn0eml,"I thought it was a really good movie, the ending was a little cliche but I sort of expected that. The sound track was awesome I found myself nodding my head to the tunes almost every scene. It got me thinking about how good a movie can be if the soundtrack to the movie is really on point and works well with how the movie flows. It reminded me of Gaurdians of the Galaxy soundtrack. I was also wondering what other movies out there have a soundtrack that is like this movie and Gaurdians, not style of music but how the music really brings out the life of the movie and is a key part yo how the movie works.

I'm sorry I'm actually having a hard time trying to make that make sense I hope y all understand what I'm trying to say. I want to see more movies where the soundtrack is a big part of the movie, like the two movies mentioned above and also a movie called Redline, where the music really adds to the story itself and goes with the scene. I'm sure I'm not making too much sense since a soundtrack is literally played throughout the movie just for the purpose of making that scene more memorable and stand out.

SPOILERS...

I completely loved Deborah and her accent. That's a southern accent right? IMO, the movie was directed with a 70s style (especially the beginning), 80s clothing and a bunch of songs from a bunch of eras in a modern 2017(?) I loved that. Also the movies of Fight Club, Monster's Inc. etc and the black and white dream shot was perfect. I have minor nitpicks like John Bernthal's character having only 5 min in the movie, Casey's character turning good and sacrificing himself could have and should have been done better. The last 10 minutes are sort of weird. I would have liked it more had it ended with both of them just driving to his mom's song. That way the sequel can go in any direction.

Finally, as someone who has lived in the States but isn't from there, Edgar Wright really outdoes himself. All the places, the characters, the dialogue, etc. feels really American to me. Again, I love Deborah's accent!",6jxijs

3. Why'd Doc make a point about never using the same crew twice, and then essentially uses the same crew for the last job? 3 out of 4 in that crew were in the first crew, Bats replaces Griff.

jon hamm who i've always pictured as a beta wall street guy (haven't seen a lot of his work) really impressed me.

kevin spacey great as always.

the guy who banged ricks wife was amazing as well. whenever i see actors i always want to compare their abilities and performance to other things i've seen them in. aside from kevin spacey, I could not really the characters in the movie as hints of other characters performed by the actors in other projects.

this is the first hollywood movie that i've seen in maybe forever that didn't overcut action sequences (brian mills hopping a fence from taken 3) and ruin the movie. the driving and drifting was better than any fast and the furious franchise movie you'll ever see (tokyo drift is up there though)

dji4jep,"Let me preface this by saying I'm a big fan of Edgar Wright. Both Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz totally blew me away when I first saw them in theaters, and I still enjoy watching them from time to time.

Baby Driver, for the most part, was simply okay. While the editing and directing were both top notch (as expected), the second half of the movie became a complete mess story wise. From the final heist onward, there were far too many scenes of them inexplicably escaping the cops (there was absolutely no way Jon Hamm could have escaped from the shoot-out in which his wife dies), and gradually the strands that held the plausibility of the plot began to unravel. 

While the romance was passable for the most part, the things that tied Debora to the plot were painfully coincidental. In that: they just so happened to be driving by her diner at a specific point in the plot (Bats just so happened to want to stop there), they just so happened to later play Debora's tape in a sea of of other tapes, and Monica just so happened to make note of the connection between the two. Yikes. So incredibly forced.

I wanted to love it, but I came out just simply liking it. And the more I thought about and discussed it with my girlfriend, the more I disliked about it. 6.5/10 from me, mainly due to the awesome editing that is signature of Wright. Everything else was just painfully okay. 

TLDR; The plot went went so far off the rails in the last 30 minutes that it almost ruined the movie entirely. ",6jxijs
djm5s9w,"I was excited to see this after the reviews and the gushing from folks on here (I saw a few comments discussing whether this movie is in the running for GOAT). I feel like I might be from outer space or something because I thought it was just *okay*.

Don't get me wrong, from a technical point of view, it was impressive in a few ways. The way the filmmakers timed on-screen action to music was cool. The car chases felt real and more probable than they usually do in modern action films.

But my god! The writing! The protagonist was grating. He felt like a guy that someone with no friends imagines ""cool"" people are like, if that makes sense. I didn't care much for him or anything else in the story. To wit: there are three real female characters in the story, and they exist solely to die to give the protagonist a tragic love story, fall in love with the protagonist, and die to give the villain a reason to be the villain -- that's it, in that order. 

Doc's turn at the end -- to go from being the main source of trouble for the protagonist to sacrificing his life for him because ""he was in love once,"" -- was utterly ridiculous, undeserved, and unbelievable. None of the criminals acted like any criminal I've ever known. It was like all of the characters were written by someone who's never left their mother's basement. ""This is what cool people act like, this is what my fantasy cute waitress girlfriend would act like, ooh and this is what the *bad* guys act like, I'm sure!"" 

The flow and the narrative structure of the film felt off. It went on for at least 15 minutes longer than it had any right to.

I'm not saying the movie was shit. The technical aspects were good, but the story was.... not. At all. I'm actually, really shocked at the thunderous praise it's getting. It's average at best.

edit: I've just realized that the only two Edgar Wright films I even got close to enjoying were co-written by Simon Pegg (*Shaun of the Dead*), or based on an existing property and narrative (*Scott Pilgrim*). Maybe he's just not my cup of tea.  ",6jxijs
djt3bth,"Outside of editing to match with the music, I was thoroughly underwhelmed by most of this movie. Poor dialogue, flat characters, predictable plot (except when it was forcibly unpredictable) and unrealistic sequences of events. The part where Darling says her name and then is like ""I thought we weren't supposed to say our names?"" What? There was so much punchy, throwaway dialogue that wanted so hard to be QT-esque but fell flat. QT dialogue only works because it adds character or adds to the tone of the film despite it being completely irrelevant or distracting from the actual plot. Here it was cliche criminal speak that did nothing but highlight how incapable these henchmen were or reinforce what we already know about baby. Yes, we get he listens to music, move along.

Baby's back story was cliche as it was forced. Only two flashback cutscenes and it still felt like the lingered on it for too long. 90% of this movie felt like they cut and paste a bunch of common elements from popular heist/criminal action movies. I was just not impressed. The one saving grace was the matched action to the music but that could have been done better. And was the end really necessary? It felt overwrapped. I did not get the hype.",6jxijs
djzcgp3,"This was a movie that I wanted to like so much, but it was so confused with its storytelling that it just left me unsatisfied. The characters are so ridiculously inconsistent in their behavior, that I didn't even care anymore. Aside from the soundtrack and first two scenes of the movie (which were amazing), I felt that it was an empty movie with no soul in it. ",6jxijs
djiilvh,"I love Edgar Wright all the way back to Spaced. But man, Baby Driver let me down. 

Started off great. High energy. Great music choreography with everything happening. Then it turned into the usual

The ""love at first sight"" angle was so boring and not at all necessary. We already cared for him. Didn't need 20 minutes of George Lucasesque romantic dialogue to slow things down. 

And after an explosive beginning and crazy cool driving it devolves into a climactic..... foot chase. What?!

And then after slamming people and objects with his car.... he shoots the guy. 

Wanted to love this movie. So badly. But really it was Stomp with cars and guns. 

Tldr; Loved the beginning. Bored in the middle. Disappointed with the finale. Boring romance not needed",6jxijs
djp2gqf,"It was by no means a bad film, but it didn't feel like the 5/5, 97% fresh etc. everyone keeps talking about - which sucks because I bloody loved the trailer and went in excited.  

The opening chase is amazing, no doubt about that, but then after that it sort of fell apart for me. It felt like it didn't really know what it wanted to do with itself and by the end, when it felt like it was getting back on track, it missed and I left feeling very disappointed - particularly with some character motivations and beats.  

I know the soundtrack is getting a lot of love, and I know why the filmmakers did what they did with it, but I found the constant songs a little overbearing by about an hour in. I wanted to hear the dialogue in places better, but was always being bombarded with the music. I hate to say it almost felt a bit like Suicide Squad in places with the song choices and trying to be cool.  

Plus, the less said about the constant use of the iPod and the headphones, the better. 

I admire what Wright attempted to do, but it missed the mark for me to be considered a classic. Catch it on Netflix when you get the chance. 

",6jxijs
djpnksk,"It's a bit overrated but very entertaining.  Hamm was great and very menacing toward the end.  Felt like Foxx was just playing Foxx, he didn't come across as scary, just insecure.  Thought the romance was pretty cliche and Baby's non-humorous dialogue was boring.  Also thought the ending felt tacked on.  Otherwise was enjoyable.  Just did not live up to the hype at all.",6jxijs
djqki66,"I came into this movie extremely excited because:

1. I love the Cornetto trilogy
2. I'm a giant gear head who loves car chases

Some things I like about the movie:

1. When Baby is on top of a situation, the music syncs up with the action perfectly. The opposite happens when he has no control of the situation. Very nice touch, especially when Bats starts working with the team.
2. All star performances from Kevin Spacey, John Hamm, Jamie Foxx, and CJ Jones. Definitely the best actors in the movie.
3. Some of the songs used had me tapping my foot throughout. Very solid music choices there.
4. The one take shot when Baby went for coffee after the first chase was so fun to watch because of the choreography and perfect syncing with the music. After this scene, I was basically expecting the rest of the movie to be like this.

However...

Some things I didn't like:

1. Baby was flat out boring. I can see some Drive influence in his character, but in a movie as fast paced and upbeat as this one, there's no reason the main character should feel out of place. His backstory, while tragic, didn't help me feel any more invested in a character that seemed to only be interested in a paycheck. Any of the above mentioned characters would have made a better lead.
2. The [extreme violence](#spoiler) towards the end was out of left field, especially considering the lighthearted tone of the film at times. The movie didn't know what tone to stick with and it can be jarring.
3. I'll be honest, most of the car chases were unremarkable. A lot of cliches and unbelievable sequences in a bad way, like the part in the first chase with the 2 other red cars. The only one I found remotely interesting was the security car heist chase because of the plain clothes security guard chasing them down.
4. What was Doc's deal at the end when [he had a change of heart and gave Baby money after he intentionally fucked up the heist? Sure, Doc likely doesn't know Baby killed Bats, but Doc knew Baby wasn't 100% on board after he tried to leave at 2 AM. Why help him instead of kill him and skip town? Doc is well connected and knew other drivers, so there's no reason to stick with a liability like Baby after the world came crashing down.](#spoiler)

After watching this one, I can say that I'm glad I saw it, but I wish I hadn't paid $13 for my ticket (damn you AMC). I'd give it a 7/10, definitely worth a watch when it hits Netflix or Family Video. ",6jxijs
djhre4e,"This was one of the best films I've seen in quite a long time. Lily James and Jamie Foxx were fantastic (but really all of them were) , and all of the sound editing and mixing were really on point. I thought the pacing was perfect as well. I'm really really impressed with this, and Edgar Wright has definitely become one of my favorite directors after this.

All of the scenes with Angel Elgort and Lily James were perfection. When Beach Boys started playing when they first met, I knew that I was watching something special.

There have been a lot of good movies so far(Get Out, Logan, Wonder Woman, Colossal), but this movie had me grinning from ear to ear the entire time. It filled me with non stop joy, it was tense, it was funny, it was everything I wanted it to be. I loved everything about this movie and can't wait to see it again.",6jxijs
djhydwu,"This movie was fucking awesome. It's exactly what a summer film should be, pure 100% cool entertainment. Light-hearted and funny, but stylish with an edge. I loved pretty much every second of it. No it's not perfect but I was smiling like an idiot and bobbing my head the entire run time, imagining that I was as cool as Baby. 

We need to do our part and spread the word so this thing doesn't flop like some of his other films. I'm worried that it's title will hurt it's box office, because it comes off like some kids movie or something (the Boss Baby). It's important to show to hollywood that yes, we do want clever well-written/directed/edited non-franchise films to keep us entertained. 

",6jxijs
djhymb9,Just got out of the theater. I can confidently say that this movie will be in my top five movies of 2017. The way that Edgar Wright blended the music into the film was amazing. It was like watching the most riveting music video. ,6jxijs
djhz31k,"The movie is super fun, and I loved how it was basically an action musical with the way the older music fit with the movie and the movie made music itself throughout.

Also, am I the only one that didn't get an after credits scene or is r/movies trying to troll me?",6jxijs
dji103j,"Favorite moment by far is when everyone listens to the ""Is he slow?"" tape. Everyones reactions were fucking perfect. Also felt much more action and suspense driven and less jokey thand Wright's other  which was an awesome mix up for him. The guy can direct the shit out of the camera and it was a joy watching some of the best driving stunts I've seen coupled with his visuals and of COURSE the music. Not much else can be added to that. Fucking amazing all around. Can't wait to watch again!",6jxijs
dji1t32,"The film is as masterfully crafted as I would expect from Wright. The camera work, editing, and sound are incredible, as are most of the performances. That said, and perhaps this is simply because I'm a huge fan of both the Driver and Drive, I couldn't help but feel disappointed with the narrative and how the film become more and more derivative and conventional as it went. With this combined with the action sequences containing few big moments (they're excellently done but they lack the fist pump conclusions that my favorite action films contain) made it become far less than what it began as...

Oh well. That long take, semi-musical walk through the street was brilliant and I always like Wright films more on a rewatch.",6jxijs
dji34xv,Who knew Atlanta cops were this stupid,6jxijs
dji4nlh,"Phenomenally fun movie that had style and a pulse. I went in with HUGE expectations, favorite director and made my fav film (Hot Fuzz), and the film exceeded those expectations.

The actors are well cast. The sound editing is breathtaking and people should riot if it doesn't grab the Oscar for it. The script is tight af, with wonderful set up and pay off (often shit you don't realize until the pay off was being set up). The actions scenes were great and the way they synced up to music heightened them.

If you don't like this film you have no soul and I don't want to be around you. You don't have to love the film or be as fanboyish as I am, but if you come out of the film with anything but positive thoughts about it you are wrong. 

Brighton Rock was perfectly utilized. ",6jxijs

I get some of the criticisms here: the characters are mostly simple, for example, and some of the music is a tad out of place. 

However, the action is fantastic, the editing is spectacular, and this was definitely not a predictable film story-wise. Up until the last few minutes, any number of characters could have been the primary antagonist.

I felt the love story was terrible and felt shoehorned. Also the final act of the film was way too campy for my taste. The shootout when Darling dies was ridiculous. Doc sacrificing himself, Griff and the ridiculous parking garage sequence. To me that entire final act brought the film down.

I plan on seeing it again just to see the differences from the screening I saw.",6jxijs
djn3tdb,"It was good, not great. The real star is Edgar Wright's direction - seriously that man oozes talent out of every orifice. 

• The movie would have better without Baby's back story. The Tinnitus thing wasn't necessary - I would have accepted Baby just loves music and is bad at small talk.  

• The character of Baby came off... self righteous. He doesn't doubt he's a wonderful person. Didn't like this about his character. 

• The whole thing with the mixtapes was cute, but it was wasted time that could have been used to flesh out something dramatic. 

• [When Jamie Foxx died, the movie lost a lot. Jon Hamm couldn't measure up as the new bad guy.](#spoiler) 

• [Kevin Spacey's last minute change of heart was nonsensical - and his final self sacrifice completely unearned. He needed more development to make those plot points work - but no time for that, we need all those back story flashbacks and scenes of Baby playing DJ.](#spoiler)

The most boring character became a groan inducing stereotypical horror movie villain and Kevin Spacey's character was wasted potential. Ansel Elgort was great, as was the music and sound editing of course. A disappointing 3/5 that felt like a short turned feature length without enough development. You can almost see on the screen when the budget started running out. ",6jxijs
dk6d8or,"Slightly late to the party, but I do want to mention what a lot of other comments haven't. I saw it twice, enjoyed it less the second time. 
I think the first half is fantastic. The chase scenes, the mood, the pacing. All excellent. 

The second half however, kind of fell flat. On my first viewing, I was pretty forgiving because it was so exciting and I really enjoyed everything leading up to the face off with Buddy. It was all over the place. They used, what, 3 different cars to kill him? Then he manages to jump out of the car at the last second, shoot a handgun right next to Baby's ears, and *then* finally dies by Debora and a shot to the leg. They drive off into the sunset so to speak but then the cops finally catch them. I did actually like him serving time instead of getting away with everything, but I also didn't like how he was this innocent kid. I mean he did aid these killers and robbers and caused a lot of deaths indirectly and millions of dollars in damages. 
How Debora and his foster father weren't terrified of him is beyond me. I guess it's just kind of fantastical and it's romantic and all that and not supposed to be very realistic in that way. 

But like I said, I really did enjoy the film. Especially the first time. However, I think the ending made what was a great film, into just an okay one.

dk1lkjt,"I don't care that the plot was lackluster, that it was full of cliches, that the portrayal of women wasn't particularly empowering, that the characters were of a familiar mold and had semi predictable arcs, that it wasn't a study of the morality and psychology of robbers, that Debora unrealistically makes life altering decisions on a whim. This was still my favorite movie of the year, because that's not the point. It's just the whole style, the use of music, the action scenes, everything was slick and perfectly meticulously directed in such a beautiful way. And I don't find it particularly problematic that the characters make unrealistic decisions, because even though the setting is real world, the whole thing is kind of a fantasy in a way. I just really liked it. ",6jxijs
djoe9b8,"I was hoping for something like Snatched, In Bruges, Lucky Number Slevin, Seven Psychopaths, Lock Stock, Fargo etc. and this movie wasn't that, so I was kind of disappointed. 

I thought they did a good job making the movie but this isn't a heist movie or a crime-comedy movie, it's more of kind of a teenage love story. there's just a bit too much sunshine behind it - the criminals/characters are relevant to the world the movie creates but the movie isn't really grounded in our reality. The movie felt more like a comic book/graphic novel adaptation.  the actual narrative was pretty weak and the rationale linking the events together wasn't really central to the movie. 

the strengths are that it was stylistically well done. I think a lot of folks will enjoy the movie. Sam was great. This just doesn't fall into the genre I hoped it would be. I've also kind of had enough of Kevin Spacey playing a powerful guy in a suit.",6jxijs

djpsbem,"I feel like I saw a different movie than a lot of the people in this thread.  I enjoyed the movie but didn't particularly love it.  If it was on at a friend's house, I'd sit through it but it's not something I'd find on my own.

For example, Jamie Foxx's character kills people...because that's what he does?  Why didn't Kevin Spacey's character know about that issue (or the issue with the butcher) when is job is to ""know everything about everyone"" as he put it.  Or if he did know about it, he chose to compromise his own job which makes no sense, either (the dude potentially blows the group's cover over a box of gum!).

That said, I did enjoy Foxx's screen time.  He provided a lot of tension in every scene he was in due to the promise of violence as well as providing a nice foil to Jon Hamm's and Jon Bernthal's characters.  All of them are fine getting their hands dirty but each has a way they prefer to do things.  Foxx's character's death was sudden but not terribly so IMO.  But I'm left wondering what the point of his character was?  To screw up the job by killing the fence?

I was pleasantly surprised that Jon Hamm's character was the main antagonist, and not Jamie Foxx's or Kevin Spacey's (which I felt like it was setting up for).  But that said, I don't get his motivations.  I mean I get his wife was killed because of Baby's botching of the job.  But his arc felt...unfulfilling.  I did like how he tried to develop a relationship with Baby before going after him instead of being a 2-dimensional henchman.

Back to the Post Office Job, why did Baby go for the job?  Because he felt threatened by the other members?  Because he thought it would be easier to sneak out?  And why didn't Spacey's character pick up on the lie since it's established Spacey's character knows when Baby is lying?  That scene started off strong but didn't feel like it delivered.

As another poster said, the movie feels like it should have ended earlier in the diner with Kevin Spacey's character waiting and I have to agree.  It seemed like they wanted Spacey to be a calculating boss that puts his emotions behind Business (with a capital B).  He's put his kid on surveillance (using him as an asset similar to other members on the crew) before so the turn at the end of the movie felt like it came out of nowhere.

There are other issues with the movie but I feel the above covers most of my gripes with the film.",6jxijs

djmxo57,"well cast, well shot, well put together in terms editing, action set pieces and music, feels like a three way cross between drive, u.n.c.l.e and john wick. definitely would recommend it.

but, it's only good by comparison, to what 2017 has to offer so far. it's an above average flick, not a great one. it's being hyped up as a great movie but its not quite there

choice of music plays into the educational retro trend popularised by movies like guardians where targeted audience mostly millennials get   to rediscover some of classics which is great actually,but it's more crowd pleasing than substance. pacing and story gets pretty messy at times but is saved by the action sequences and other distractions right before you question it, which to me is a calculated reminder that this is a fun movie, don't think too much just enjoy it.  btw did get-away drivers just replaced hitmen/assassins/bodyguards and became the protagonists of hollywoods lone wolf action genre?

djq4ouc,"Overall I really like this movie, the editing, the soundtrack, the jokes that were played all hit home for me. The way it was shot was real nice and its a well made movie all in all. I enjoyed it a lot. However...


[I think where I stumbled a wee bit was in the final moments of the movie. Early on Jon Hamm's character Buddy tells Baby that he too used to be a speed demon in his youth. I thought this was the perfect setup to what would culminate in the ultimate car chase scene in the movie. Instead they just clashed cars for a minute? I didn't really feel like that was a satisfying send off. The set up didn't match the pay off, I felt.](#spoiler)

[Also some of the character dynamics felt a little bit askew. Why did Doc change his mind so easily? Considering he threatened Baby with violence on him and those he loved earlier on, I didn't think he actually cared for him as much as he ended up doing. I don't know, I personally didn't quite buy into it.](#spoiler)


[I also found myself a little confused at the relationships in this movie, I didn't get the impression that Bats and Baby were enemies, I thought they'd end up being unlikely friends, considering that Bats apparently liked Baby enough to not kill Debra at the Diner. Maybe I got the wrong impression there, but thats what I felt throughout until Bats got speared.](#spoiler)

[Finally I felt like the ending wasn't entirely satisfying? Like, Baby loses his hearing, but it seems like it gets better again and then he gets out of prison five years later. Debra was still waiting for him (which is impressive considering they hadn't known each other that long beforehand) and then the movie just ends. I kinda feel like maybe Baby should have lost his hearing for good, but he's ok with it 'cause he's with debra again and now he's free. I know that would have seemed like a weird ending because music is such a big part of the movie, but as it is it just feels standard?](#spoiler) I'm still flip flopping on this, I'd like to hear what others think.

Finally [who was that guy that randomly started shooting at the crew during that mike myers heist? I was just looking perplexed the entire time that was happening.](#spoiler)

But yeah! Good movie overall, I've just been thinking about the stuff I didn't think worked all day today.",6jxijs
djqtrz5,"Good movie 8/10, but I do find it flawed in several ways:

* ""Baby"" could have been developed a little more - pretty much every character was more interesting than he was.

* They should have made Deborah/Debra (forgot which one?) his girlfriend or something. Like she was his girlfriend already but he did all this driving stuff behind her back. With how the movie does it, it makes NO sense for any girl to stay with a guy *who she dated exactly once* after finding out he's a bank robber getaway driver. They really should have developed their relationship more so that it would be believable that she'd wait 5 years (or longer) for Baby to get out of prison. But yeah - that would all be so much more believable if they already had been dating for awhile.

* It makes no sense that baby would just last minute completely botch the final heist. Like he should have at least got out of the area, and then do something to fuck with the other bank robbers. Also, why did he even agree to do that last heist? He should have just considered himself blessed that Doc called it off. That very night he could have just left town with Deborah.

* If Buddy was going to be the final ""bad guy"" they should have built him up more during the film's exposition. IMO Jamie Fox's character was a lot better and he would have made a lot better of a final ""boss"".

* Baby at anytime could have just gone to the police and narc'ed and make a deal with the police to avoid prosecution - this happens all the time in RL. They should have in some way ruled this option out in the movie.

* And who the fuck kills a bunch of cops and then decides to go to a diner? Makes no sense.",6jxijs

djsknk3,"I just saw Baby Driver this weekend. I went because it had a 97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Both I and my date thought the movie was ridiculously absurd. It included every possible cliche, one-dimensional characters, stilted dialogue and bad acting from a relatively star studded cast including Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey both of whom I admire greatly for their talent and body of work in general.

I have to wonder: is there some sort of conspiracy this movie and their producers have engage upon to earn such high marks on Rotten Tomatoes? Usually RT is dead on accurate but they were way off on Baby Driver. It was a huge stinker for me.",6jxijs
djyo8jh,"Just came out. Really disappointed. All that hype and RT score for nothing. Once again critics and me disagreeing.

The movie had a perfect execution. Nice footage, great pacing, the acting was top notch. The story however was non-existent. It was a nice shell without any substance. It had a potential to be a nicely executed decent story, but I was just waiting to the story to start... And the movie was over. The last action scene was too over the top action too. It had a bad ending, almost like they didn't know how to close it.  Shame.

6/10",6jxijs
djn6t8c,"Felt I had to offer my thoughts.  This whole post is lightweight __SPOILERS__ but I don't think anyone reading this thread is concerned about that.

Well, it's definitely an Edgar Wright movie.  I enjoyed it.

But I did not enjoy it as much as I expected to.  And I have identified two main reasons why.

1.  The first reason is a selfish one.  I was ready for an Edgar Wright movie with a lot of laughs and cleverly humorous dialogue intertwined in an _ostensibly_ humorless plot.  What I got instead, for the first time, was a largely humorless, grim and even depressing movie with rare sparks of humor.  Not a fan of the shift, and if all his movies had been like this, I wouldn't be quite as much of a fan of the director.

2.  A more down to earth critique: The most impressive and exciting span of time in the movie was the opening chase.  The action scenes, paced in-between the love story as they were, got progressively less exciting and interesting.  I fully expected the finale of the movie to be an even more amazing car chase than the opening act, but instead it was a short race in reverse whose editing was frankly a mess.  So the progression of the movie was a counter-intuitive high-to-low.

I do appreciate that the movie allowed the protagonists to have the best ending that it was possible for them to have, all things considered.  It would have been very disappointing, if not exactly surprising, had the ending been dubious or oughtright negative.",6jxijs
djw4r69,WAIT!!! Fuck fuck fuck?!? Is that after credits scene *real???* Did I really miss that shit? Or are the mods just assholes???,6jxijs
djly6ow,"No, this movie was not great. Wright's craftsmanship was impeccable as always, but I found myself very bored watching this unfold. Other than [Jamie Foxx's death](#spoiler), not a single moment in this film surprised me, so I was just passively watching it unfold. Also, the city of Atlanta was greatly underused, and didn't really feel like a character in the film, as it should have. Also, the whole logic behind Baby doing ""one last job"" in the 1st act, only to be called back shortly thereafter, felt contrived and strange. Yes, I knew he wasn't really done with Spacey after that early ""final"" job, but the way in which they reasoned his return did not work. Also, Spacey threatens to kill everyone he loves early on, but by the end he tries to help him escape? Why the 180 turn? Makes you realize Baby was never really in danger to begin with and could have just taken off with his girl and foster father at the start of the 2nd act. And let's be real: does anyone actually remember the car chases 2 days after seeing the film? I sure don't. Other positive: Ansel Elgort was great. Although I wish they would have better explored his struggle with inflicting violence on those affected by these heists - that shot of him studying the empty cash register at the convenience store, for example - but it didn't amount to anything. 

Baby Driver: 6/10 ",6jxijs

It's hard to describe the movie: Awesome Mix of an musical, a heist movie and a romance but man, you did it again Edgar. And the Soundtrack is pure awesomeness. Thought Guardians of The Galaxy has an awesome soundtrack? Go into Baby Driver!",6jxijs
djidfse,"It was fucking awesome. I didn't get the gist of it at first so when they focused on Baby singing and drumming on the first robbery, and again when they were planning the second, I was like ""oh shit, this is really gonna be a long movie for me."" I just didn't realize it was going to be musical-based, since I didn't look at any behind the scenes stuff, wikipedia, etc. I thought it was straight heist/action. But within like 5 minutes, they completely switched the vibe and it worked out perfectly. So in conclusion, the first 10-15 minutes left me in the dark, and everything after that was fantastic. Easy 8.5-9 out of 10.

[Throughout most of the movie, he's established to be a ruthless crime lord, willing hire violent criminals, use his own young nephew in his heist schemes, to let innocent civilians die, and threaten to hurt Baby's loved ones. However, near the climax of the movie, he ~~does~~ has a sudden ~~heel~~ face turn and is willing to give his own life to help Baby and Deborah escape.

djkvb3a,"I enjoyed the hell out of the movie but I'm hung up on something and I'm hoping someone can talk this out. 

My issue with the film is Debora's character; why would she go along with Baby's actions after he shoots Buddy? She doesn't know the criminal life he leads nor the fact he's been forced into it. That shooting, from her perspective, would be a shocking turn for her to accept and go along with, no? The only side of Baby Deb saw was the toe-tapping, shy, music loving fella who chauffeurs so wouldn't that development in the diner just paint Baby as a bad dude before anything else?",6jxijs

dk0lf36,"So disappointed considering how high the RT reviews were. It was a decent movie but I was expecting it to be insanely good, not just mediocre. There's literally no plot. Ansel Elgort is a mediocre actor. Jamie Foxx was so one dimensional. Even Spacey felt so one dimensional.",6jxijs
dkoazd8,"I finally saw this movie last week.  It wasn't hyped like Get Out, but it's very overrated.  I guess it would appeal to teens and hipsters that like listening to old black music.  Did Baby's mom like or sing that kind of music?  Because at least they could make the connection of the movie soundtrack to his mom like they did for Star Lord's mom in GotG.  His mix tapes didn't sound like anything from the soundtrack either, so I think the director thought it would just appeal to hipsters.

When Baby started dancing to the coffee shop, I couldn't help but think of Tobey McGuire's [Spiderman strut](https://youtu.be/rDGRAHBojWE?t=40s).  Baby may be slightly better looking, but he's still a dork.  

The way the last job devolved had me shaking my head.  I get that they are street-level thug criminals, especially Bats.  Why would a mastermind like Spacey work with them?  The crews were not believable as professional criminals for heists.  The director establishes Bats as the loose cannon but also wants us to believe he's a smart criminal.  So Bats wants to randomly kill a waitress on the eve of a heist?  Then it implies he kills a convenience store clerk because he doesn't want to pay for $20 in items?  Is that the trail you want to leave for the FBI when they can match his picture from a convenience store camera to a big heist?  

I think Lily James (Debora) is very attractive and talented, so I hope she gets a few leading roles in the future.  Other than her, there wasn't any standout actor despite some notable names like Spacey and Hamm.  Overall, a 6.5/10 movie.

Baby Driver would be considered an average movie (possibly even a TV movie) in the 80s or 90s, but it gets rave reviews today.  The key word to define this movie is stylish (or at least it tries to be).  Style over substance.  Maybe that's why I don't remember much from it.  ",6jxijs
djj4z29,"This film loves *Thief* so much it manages to have an even more reductive view of women than the early 80s did.

djir5ii,"Seriously Hollywood, take note! Get Out and Baby Driver are the best movies of the year so far, notice how they don't have numbers at the end of their titles or were produced with two hundred million dollar budget!",6jxijs
dkcs7po,"I thought that [Baby Driver](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3890160/) was pretty good, but I don't think it was magnificent, especially compared to some of [Edgar Wright](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0942367)'s other movies. 

The first coffee run scene is spectacular, but the rest of the movie pales in comparison. The acting was overall pretty bad (especially [Jamie Foxx](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004937), who didn't manage to play the psycopath-type character at all well), the romance was one of the least convincing romances I've seen this year, and the whole story was just a run-of-the-mill heist movie.

That being said, the cinematography and choreography of the fights and driving was outstanding, and looking at the individual scenes alone, it's easy to see why people loved it. But for me the movie as a whole just falls flat. Perhaps it was because my expectations from Edgar Wright were too high? After all, [Scott Pilgrim vs The World](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446029) is one of my favourite movies of all time. Who knows... 

I just don't see why people are raving about it so much. Same with [La La Land](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3783958) last year. It was pretty good in my opinion, but not great, yet everyone else seemed to think it was amazing.",6jxijs
djlchr2,"I'm apparently the only one that didn't like the film. The story made no sense. Debora's character was poorly written, as she asked no questions and blindly followed Baby around as his prop girl whenever called, and even waited for him for 5 years. The last 1/3rd of the film was a cliched mess, not to mention the motives for the characters' actions were very underdeveloped. And then Kevin Spacey threatens to murder everyone Baby loves suddenly is this guy who really cares about him. Give me a break. I feel like this is one of those films where the flaws will become more apparent once the rose tinted glasses wear off. ",6jxijs

I thought it was trying too hard to be clever, and I had a serious issue with Ansel Elgort and Lily James -- but especially Ansel Elgort.  They both just seemed like children playing dress-up, especially him.  I just didn't get any sense of any weight from Baby, his character was just this cipher who drives cars and likes music and has an achingly badly manufactured dramatic past. Yawn. And the reason for calling him Baby? ""He doesn't talk much so it's like waiting for a baby's first words""? Cringe.",6jxijs

dk0tm25,"Just saw this on Saturday. Walked away totally underwhelmed.

Ansel Egort tried, but man, that guy isn't ready to carry a movie on his own. Everything his character did was so mannered, stylized, and forced that he didn't feel like a real person reacting to anything. His character was paper thin.

Some people here are blasting Jamie Foxx, but in my view he was the only one on screen who brought a little charisma to his scenes. I thought he stole every scene he was in. Hamm and Spacey were their dependable selves.

[But come on -- Spacey keeps Baby in indentured servitude only to sacrifice himself at the end? Baby has a deaf old guy in a wheelchair for a roommate for...what reason, exactly? Oh, and if you're going to have a movie about a kid who's crazy talented at being a getaway driver, maybe show more than 1.5 car chase scenes?](#spoiler)

A lot of elements to the movie -- from plotting to scripting to set pieces -- felt incoherent, like Wright just decided ""Hey, let's put a shootout HERE, let's put some tough-guy dialogue HERE, let's add some cheap melodrama HERE"".

Anyway, it was light entertainment that felt like a high-production Netflix original. A decent time-waster but not deserving of the lofty reviews it's getting.",6jxijs
djie62c,"First off, I totally loved this movie. Easily my favorite action film since Mad Max: Fury Road. 

My only (minor) gripe with the movie was that Baby's backstory was jarringly similar to that of Star Lord's in the Guardians of the Galaxy. Between the ""traumatized boy who sees his mother's death"" to the significance to the cassette tape and music left behind by his mother, I couldn't help but get my mind off of Star Lord. 

Anyone else get that feeling?

The story didn't do anything to grab me in and I didn't find myself growing attached to any of the characters enough aside from Jon Hamm's Buddy as he was the only one that had any emotion. Baby kept having flashbacks for the sake of establishing he had a tragic past and... No real trigger.

I still rate Hot Fuzz and SotD as Edgar Wright's best movies. I respect this as a work but I feel it could have done a lot more with the same characters and plot.",6jxijs

Like the whole thing with driving out of atl with a car we don't own with a plan we don't have thing is played out. I couldn't take it seriously to the point where I thought the movie was trying to be a campy version of the trope. The sad thing is, the movie doesn't make you want to laugh it makes you cringe. Everyone seemed like they were over acting besides Kevin spacey. Dude who puts Asian in home invasion was my favorite heist teammate and of course he bites the dust.

It felt like a poorly paced heist movie that turns into the fault in our stars. All of the story pieces could've been used in much more compelling and exciting ways but they went for the 14 year old who can't wait to be 18 type of love story.

It had great action and a great intro but that was honestly the climax of the movie for me.

djpqchj,"How's this movie getting so much praise? Yes the music is excellent and the action choreography is spot on, but to me it felt more of a gimmick and never being able to take the next step as a masterpiece. Jon Hamm was equally menacing and a fine william because on some level you sympathise with him. But then this is not a heist movie as no heist is actually shown nor a out and out car chase one for it only has about two and a half chase scenes running ulto 12 min in 112 min runtime.
Other than Baby and Buddy other characters were pretty much surface deep or clichéd and too many cut scenes in chase sequence ruined abir of fun for me. Debbie's character could have been replaced with a puppy and this movie would have been far better off. Bats came off as more Ott than truly scary and the change of heart for Spacey's character felt bit out of place.
On a side note, can someone explain to me why there was shot of the bag Darling kept in the front seat as they were running from the police, i don't think it turned up again and Baby escaped empty handed.
The opening scene however was impressively done. This movie could have been far better but somehow managed to fall short.

Baby was made too much of a good guy and victim when he really isn't. At best, he is a honorable thief. He directly causes his entire team to die and him to go to prison because he had to throw a tantrum and ruin the car when it was time to run away.

It was much more of a straightforward heist movie than I expected, and the music was cool at parts but worked more in a typical soundtrack-to-get-you-pumped way rather than being this genre-destroying musical convention.

Some funny stuff but just not as much.

He would be lucky to avoid the death penalty and would certainly never see the light of day again. Also his girl would be doing at least a few years in prison for aiding a fugitive.",6jxijs
djn1ei7,"Okay I did like this movie.  It wasn't amazing and I think Wright has done better and a big problem was character motivation.  Kevin Spacey did not make sense as a character.  He's suddenly not a criminal mastermind because he ""fell in love once"" and defends Ansel's character in the elevator?  It just didn't make sense what was the motivation for that change in character.  Also Jon Hamm's character has multiple problems with Jamie Foxx's character but doesn't do anything to stop him from pulling the gun towards Lily James.  I feel like the movie would be better framed if Baby and Jon Hamm had grown closer and in the end Jon feels betrayed because he defended baby.  Also stopping Jamie Foxx seemed more in line with Hamm's character because unless he truly gets pissed off he's the calm collected one who doesn't want to randomly cause a scene. ",6jxijs
djrql2i,"I'm not really sure what to think. At first I thought his dancing and lip syncing was cool, but I had a hard time feeling any sympathy for him or the crew because they were so rotten and violent. Maybe if the bank robberies were based off of desperation rather than jobs it would have made more sense? I don't mind the cutesy stuff or the dancing, but again- it felt off for someone who's connected to murderers. One moment he's stuck in a room with murderers, the next moment he's dancing for his comic relief foster father. 

I feel like if he was being forced to do these jobs he's be a bit more serious or ragged. Just telling a girl he has a crush on he'd like to drive away wasn't enough for me. Jamie Foxx was so evil-- I couldn't stand watching him because everywhere he went it was a shit show. Why would Spacey re hire him if he killed the guard for the armored truck in the first job? Are they supposed to kill? Is that part of their plan? Does anything matter in this film or are we watching a videogame? 

Maybe I was in a weird mood when I saw it but I went very excited for it and left feeling sort of ripped off.

djibv1c,"I try not to go into movies with expectations, I'm a happier person when I don't. But this is Edgar Wright; walking into the theater last night I just couldn't help myself. So with my expectations against me, I sat down to watch maybe the best movie I've seen this year. This movie is like a musical, and Wright's expert direction and camera movement keeps your heart pumping with every beat of the soundtrack. I definitely recommend you all go see it.  In terms of how it holds up to his other work, I do believe it's the weakest, but that's not really fair... his other 4 movies are masterpieces. ",6jxijs
djjen9p,"I can't help but feel the same way about Edgar Wright as I feel about Michel Gondry. They're both great at dreaming up super impressive 'director moments' but they really need to be teamed up with a good writer or it just starts to feel a little like empty gimmickry.

I mean, I don't even need an incredibly intricate story. I enjoy films that create a thick, beautiful atmosphere more than those based on delivering a straight narrative. I just think, whether it's atmosphere, story or anything else, the audience needs to get something more than the chance to marvel at the incredibly impressive trick *you* the *director* just did. Otherwise it starts to feel like a masturbatory 80s hair metal guitar solo.",6jxijs

It felt much longer than it actually was, and I don't care how long or short a movie is, but if I can feel it dragging on, it's a disappointment.

Quite liked the cast though, with the exception of Ansel Elgort who I never really bought as a cool driver because he came off as such a dweeb in some scenes. But Lily James in particular impressed me.

I have trouble answering if I'd recommend this movie because I saw it with three other people and they all loved it, so I know I'm in the minority here, but it just wasn't for me. But I was never sold on the trailer either.",6jxijs

It was way better than I expected especially because most of the outdoor settings that occured in the movie happened at my old campus Georgia State University. The [bank they rob in the beginning and the post office at the end](#spoiler) were all within a couple blocks from each other. They pretty much got the logistics of driving around different parts of Atlanta except [ the part where they planned to rob the armored truck in Dunwoody and then drive to the airport which is on the other side of town and seemed a bit unrealistic](#spoiler) but even that is something you wouldn't know unless you actually lived in the area.

I found Jon Hamm a bit distracting, every time I looked at him it really felt like HEY there's Jon Hamm! until his character turned. Jamie Foxx was amazing though, he took me there. Everyone was kind of too clean and good looking for me to get fully immersed.

I found it hard to believe that Baby could be so reclusive and yet so charming, it felt like something wasn't adding up about his character. His genius memory at the meeting and whatever was a bit of an eyeroll. The romance was a little weirdly paced, but I guess it's supposed to be a love at first sight situation.

Overall LOVED it, all of the music selections were great and the editing was clever and snappy. The car chases were fun. (It's definitely not replacing Hot Fuzz as my fave Edgar Wright movie though)",6jxijs

After the first heist, I was disappointed at how fast the cuts were in the driving sequences.  I wasn't expecting a chase scene on par with Bullitt or Ronin, but longer cuts would have been nice.

That said, the casting was wonderful for everyone.  It has been a while since a movie had me hating a character as much as I did Bats.

The only thing I found off about it, and this may just be me missing something, was the dude chasing after Jamie Foxx's first job.

Plus, the foreshadowing (Monster's Inc, when he sees red you'll be seeing black) and scenes in the diner and laundromat that I'm sure are nods to other directors.

dji5jqy,"A triumph- For its sheer originality in execution and a cast of cool-cats capable of charming your socks off.
An unexpectedly delicious cocktail of two genres, musical and heist-movie, it starts with Baby (Elgort) in a high-speed chase, skidding between trucks and swerving in and out of tunnels to save bank robber Buddy (Hamm) and his friends from the police. They’re all puppets in the hands of Doctor (Spacey), who never uses the same crew twice except for his lucky Baby.
But little does Doc know that his good luck charm has started getting some bad feelings about the business, especially after meeting Debora (James). Doctor plans one last loot but this is where Baby shifts gears and goes off-track.
This is a musical unlike any other. People are neither dressed in costume, nor do they break out in song. The music comes from lyrical lines in the dialogue; it comes from the rhythm of machine guns firing bullets; it comes from a bundle of cash as someone brushes its edges. Steven Price’s smartly produced score and Bill Pope’s captivating camerawork result in a movie that is no less than a new car: slick, sexy and smooth.
And this car backfires very few times. The dialogue-heavy second act tries to keep up the momentum with repartee instead of revving engines, but fails. Kevin Spacey delivers a performance that is just too reminiscent of his Frank Underwood from House Of Cards.
Spacey stays in familiar territory but Elgort, as Baby, takes the leap from teen-movie Romeo to action-movie Rambo effortlessly. It’s a riot to watch Foxx and Hamm as tough guys with tattoos who are constantly bickering. James’s inherent niceness is almost essential to a movie this morally skewed.",6jxijs
dji5qob,"This was far more suspenseful than I expected it to be. The scene where Buddy stops Baby from leaving at 2 a.m. made my fucking heart jump. Also the use of close - ups during Baby and Jonathan's scenes were fucking phenomenal. Felt straight out of Old Hollywood.

I think it should've ended with him taking off from the diner, but instead it had to be all anticlimactic and over-complicate its main character, who really isn't all that likable to begin with. Besides that, it's a hugely entertaining thrill ride. The performances are awesome, the dialogue is badass. But the plot quickly becomes ludicrous toward the end, and it never knows when to stop outsmarting us. After a while, it began to feel inauthentic when it was tugging at the heartstrings.

The problem here is it's not one or the other but has a lot of both and very very separate which makes both a bit lacking.

[The third act is non-sensical. Doc says he never uses the same crew twice, then all of a sudden, we've got Bats, Buddy, and Darling back with no explanation. Worse yet, Doc threatens Joe, Deborah, and Baby explicitly. He shows himself to be a ruthless tyrant and doesn't appear to have any shyness about it. So was that all just a bluff to coerce Baby into driving for him? If so, it was still a pretty sociopathic thing to do.

It lost steam for me near the middle and I was never really as hooked as I was during the opening scene.

Baby gets what he wants pretty quickly. He did his last job and he got out. And then that just isn't the case anymore. He's never really in the driver's seat the last 2/3rds of the movie. He is given an opportunity to leave again but then demands to be the driver to Doc. I thought this was part of his plan but looking back I have no idea why he did that. When he finally makes a decision to kill Bats its just out of anger, he has no real plan - if anything it put him further away from what he wants. 

The court case at the end real spells out why I didn't love the movie. While he had a conscious and was coerced, he really didn't do anything to take the wheel. He was just caught in the middle of it and then botched the job. He reacted to things near the end but never really worked to get what he wants.

dji0bq7,"It was a much needed, refreshing, *original* film in a summer that's so far been oversaturated with superhero movies and franchise blockbusters. The editing was superb and each cut, especially during the action sequences, was definitely well thought out and didn't seem out of place for the sake of a cool shot being thrown in there.

I'm definitely going to have to see this again while it's still running in theaters.",6jxijs
dji1awt,"It's like Guardians Of The Galaxy and Drive had a baby. A baby that drives. This is my favorite film of the year so far, although War For The Planet Of The Apes might give it serious competition.

Loved the whole cast, but Jon Hamm stole the show.",6jxijs

djirgnt,"I overall really enjoyed this film but I couldn't get past some of the ""try-hard"" acting that really made me cringe. The main actor also seemed really lack-luster in that he didn't really have any emtions... (attempt to be like drive?)",6jxijs
djje365,I can't remember the last time I left the theater with such a big smile other than the end of Rogue One. Literally my only complaint is that there wasn't enough Bernthal in it,6jxijs

djkl6nn,"So I think we can safely assume that Jon Bernthal died off screen, yeah?",6jxijs
djldfv4,"I watched it for the first time today at 1 PM. Once the credits came up, I immediately got on my phone and bought tickets for tonight. I then spent the next four hours waiting for my second viewing reading about it. This film blew my mind out of my ass.",6jxijs

djuvwgj,"Am I the only one that thought the first and last car chases were sloppily edited and ruined the primary focus of the film? I appreciate the stunt work and the practical effects, but after seeing it twice I can't shake this feeling off that the movie itself doesn't. The shots were too quick and there was barely any build-up or time to settle to properly digest the scenes. I personally thought the final car chase was too dark ontop of being too quickly cut, especially considering the cars themselves blended too much into the shadows. Also, am I wrong to think that the foot chase was the best sequence in this car-chase movie?",6jxijs
djz5gt1,absolutely loved the timing of different things in the movie to the soundtrack,6jxijs
dk5uh1a,Edgar Wright fucking does it again!!,6jxijs
djk482q,It was good but not Edgar's best. If someone else was cast as baby I probably would have liked it better. I thought he was the weakest part of the movie. Everyone else except Monica shined. She was so so. Soundtrack was amazing. ,6jxijs
djnlj4q,Literally the best movie I've ever seen. Edgar's grown so much as a director. This is his best yet.,6jxijs
djhw3co,"Just saw this and the best part of the movie was the editing. The long shot in the beginning (the small details) and the music selection was overall good. The comedy bits weren't too aggressive and they did a good job with adding parts to the story and how each character developed through out.

Only negatives to me was the ending was a bit tad too long like some mentioned. Also this movie to me felt similar to the movie called ""Drive"" but with a different genre. 

EDIT: to clarify, the comparison is not a huge negative, just something that should be noticed. Baby Driver was another level above editing and acting but Drive has the more dark tone. Like comparing the original batman vs the dark Knight. Both are great movies though.

And also music came from left or right (or both) depending on which one of headphones Baby plugs in, right? ",6jxijs
djpw5qv,I didn't find the romance convincing. Reminded me of Anakin and Padme. ,6jxijs
djjsf4k,"Solid. Drive did it better though. Also had the better soundtrack. Favorite Wright movie for sure.

Wish they would have either completely axed berenthal and given his scene to jamie's char. Or kept berenthal and replaced him for Jamie's scenes. It feels incomplete. Enjoyed Lily James. Thought it was too much of a popcorn flick. The car chases were whatever to me and a lot of shit was coincidence moreso than skill. Flashy. They do aknowledge the kevin spacey affection he has for baby, but they should have played it up more matter of factly, because that ending was jarring. After he tried to kill him however many times and threatened him however many times.

dk48zrk,.,6jxijs
djl1r47,"I thought it was pretty good, but no better than that.  Visually it was spot on and the way music was used was inventive.  However, the characters all sucked and the situations were simply ridiculous.   You pretty much have to suspend all common sense to follow and enjoy the plot, and this wasn't a film where I was willing to do that.",6jxijs
djtzdv7,"Thought there was one minute of non self aware greatness and it came with Ready Let's Go by Boards of Canada when Baby was leaving at 2am for the road trip. Everything else was a little too quirky, twee and serviceable.",6jxijs
djhrbe1,"This is the best heist film since Heat and instead of mindlessly copying aspects of it like its contemporaries, it does something completely new that most films would only attempt for a single scene.

From a filmmaking perspective, I would say it's flawlessly executed and Wright deserves all the praise he'll get for this film. You may not come out loving the movie like I did, but I guarantee that this will be the most interesting film you've seen in a theater so far this year.",6jxijs
djj5409,"The laundromat was probably the most beautiful scene I saw this year. The composition, the colors, the music, everything is perfect",6jxijs
djng5hf,I thought the movie was really good.  But based off reviews i was hoping for a mix or crank and spring breakers.  If i movie with those visuals/music/pace come out it would be amazing. It wasn't what i thought but i still liked it.,6jxijs
djtowpm,"Enjoyed it, but the dancing among other things got kind of corny.",6jxijs
dkcwh0i,"Watching this movie, I was continually reminded of Drive with Ryan Gosling (wow its 6 years ago already?) and the similarities between the two. I think a mixture of the two movies would be absolutely perfect, with the actors and dialog/writing of Drive mixed with the choreography, cinematography, and perhaps editing style of Baby Driver. Music is a toss up between the two since they both command very applaudable music choices. I think the main flaw with Baby Driver is that the romance that is supposed to drive the second half of the movie felt very fake and rushed, as well as Deborah (Debra?) making some pretty intense decisions while on the lam with Baby.  ",6jxijs
djsa21v,This is the movie Tarantino's been trying to make for 25 years. ,6jxijs
djipt8f,"I absolutely adored [Baby Driver](http://hvnreviews.com/baby-driver/). It's an Edgar Wright film through and through, paying wonderful homage to the car chase action film genres. While it embraces the tropes of the genre, it feels completely unique in its use of soundtrack to drive pretty much the entire film. The editing is incredibly well synced to the music, while being well edited as a film, too. The performances were great all around and while the action was fun, I was actually invested in the story and characters.

Just a fantastic film all around. Wright knows how to entertain while telling a good story.",6jxijs

dk6d4kf,"Personally i absolutely loved the film i think the problem with alot of people that don't like it don't understand how important the music is in it. Such as all of the music was diegetic which, correct me if i'm wrong, has never been done before. ",6jxijs
do0ra2r,"This feels like a lazy movie adaptation of GTA V filled with clichés and product placement. I am trying to not hate it but the massively positive reviews just don't make any sense. The cinematography and driving around is all professional but the predictable plot and cheesy characters just make it so obviously hard to take it seriously, is this supposed to be the point of it? I'm not very familiar with Edgar Wright's work but Baby Driver almost feels like a 2+ hour long Rick Roll.",6jxijs

I hated Drive",6jxijs
djnd3nd,"I haven't seen this movie, but everyone I hear from keeps saying it's amazing. It looks really cheesy, but am I wrong?",6jxijs
djjdlkb,"This was a solid film for me, but Ansel Elgort was a little stiff in certain scenes. For example, when he first talks to Debora in the diner, his lines felt stiff and forced. Not sure if that was intentional or not. 

Spacey was a little weird in this movie and his turn at the end was a  little out of place.

Really loved Jamie Foxx's character, I loved when he sarcastically clapped in the face of Buddy/Darling after her cheesy monologue. ",6jxijs
djip889,"Pretty fun movie. Liked the action scenes and the use of music (although I thought it was way too loud at times), but I thought the romance was a bit lame. That first scene where he meets her for the first time made me cringe a little. I don't buy that people talk like that, ever.

Still had a good time though, I'd watch it again.",6jxijs
djj6i28,"Every single scene with Baby and Debora has me smiling ear to ear. What a great movie, perfect down to a Tee with the music, camera shots, the way the actors fluidly moved with the music was beautiful. Edgar Wright has fucking done it again, fantastic film.",6jxijs

djlwxfg,"The first hour of this movie is so incredible and original and my God I was in awe. Then comes the midpoint and the movie completely forgot what it was. It went from being this amazing hyper-stylized action musical to just another genre film. It regains a little bit of magic by the end, but it really takes you away from all that made it great. Someone else posted that this movie was inches from greatness, I couldn't agree more. Still had a helluva time though. 8/10",6jxijs
djqtxhk,"I saw this movie last week and I can't get it out of my head. I really loved it. Because I've been mulling it over, I realized something:

You know the movie trope where if a plan is discussed ahead of time, you know it will fail, and if it isn't you know it will succeed. When prepping for the third heist, we almost don't hear the plan whatsoever, but then Wright deliberately has our main character repeat it (and tell the audience) the entire thing beat by beat. Do you think was a parody of the trope? Foreshadowing? What was going with that scene?",6jxijs
djradvt,"Baby Driver is an absolutely brilliant film from Edgar Wright. The performances in this film are all top notch. There are a lot of twists and turns that worked perfectly. I cared about the plot and was invested in the story. The car chase scenes were amazing. They were all in tune with the soundtrack, which was really fun to watch. While the film isn't a full on comedy, it provides some great laughs. The soundtrack felt like its own character. The music fits perfectly and fit very well with the story. From the directing, acting, the soundtrack, and everything in between, the film is a unique and one of a kind experience that cannot be missed.

It's a fun genre mashup that's also rather disposable, offering quick surges of pleasure akin to the cavalcade of tasty pop, rock and R&B songs that litter the soundtrack and provide the film's heartbeat. Action lovers will be impressed by the film's choreography and live stunts, one driver entering and exiting a narrow alley with 180 degree spins.   ---See it on Yidioo",6jxijs
djzgq00,Still thinking of this movie 2 weeks later,6jxijs
djn0ofo,[deleted],6jxijs
djhyiac,"Don't get me wrong, this movie is great, but I think Edgar is at his best when he is satirizing a genre like in Shaun or Hot Fuzz. In baby driver he hit a lot of generic plot points for this kind of movie. Little too predictable. Still an 8.5/10 for me",6jxijs
djpqzut,"As an [ESL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_as_a_second_or_foreign_language) and someone who is quite unfamiliar with western pop culture and songs, I didn't really like this movie as much as others. Also, I watched the film without subtitles and couldn't understand 70% of Jaime Foxx's dialogues. :/

The car chase/action choreography and Baby and Deborah's chemistry were really nice.

6.5/10

Will rewatch it sometime later, surely.

djjsae0,"This movie is fantastic. Edgar Wright combines the musical ambiance of ""Scott Pilgrim vs The World"" with his comedic chops from the Cornetto Trilogy. He then mixes that concoction with a heist film to produce ""Baby Driver."" The film follows a young getaway driver as he assists Atlanta's top burglars with their heists. Most of the film deals with Baby, played by Ansel Elgort, struggling with the morality of the criminal underworld while attempting a relationship with Deborah, portrayed by Lily James. His life takes a turn for the worst when his boss Doc, played by Kevin Spacey, teams up with a sociopath in Bats, played by Jamie Foxx. The film is an exciting non-stop thriller with a grandiose soundtrack. 

Edgar Wright continues his unique brand of comedy where the jokes are intertwined with the setting and appear unexpectedly. The movie is directed in the same manner as Wright's previous films. Action sequences benefit from Wright's experience too. Elgort's portrayal of Baby allows the character to be sympathetic despite the unlikable choices Baby makes. He and James have some good chemistry and passable Southern accents. The same can be said of Hamm and Gonzalez's characters. Jamie Foxx takes the movie and makes it his. His character, ""Bats"", establishes a menacing presence in the movie with a sense of danger. 

Overall, the film is really fun with a fantastic cast and an incredible director in Wright. Go see this film more than once.                                               ",6jxijs

dntl6f2,"Okay I had high expectations for these movie after all the good reviews and I just watched it I just can't think of all the questions we are left with: 

* How did Baby meet Doc and why he started in the first place?

* How did he meet Joe,and who actually is he ?

* What happened to his parents? Like I know they died but honestly I expected to see why they were fighting ,or if his father was abusive or anything.

* Why his name is Baby ?

I don't know I just feel like this could have been a great movie with a great plot and not just another well-made action movie(with amazing soundtrack though). I think Edgar Wright missed an opportunity on making this movie amazing on every level.",6jxijs
djiu47c,Loved the movie. Favorite movie of the year and summer so far. I only have one question that left me lost after the movie was over. Did Baby's jail time get cut short? At first I thought that last scene with him and Debora was a dream but then when it went into color it seemed real. Again if someone could clarify that would be great. Either way I'm watching it again tomorrow. ,6jxijs

My buddy just knew it was a heist film with a Subaru WRX in it. He had no expectations. 

When the credits rolled, we both had huge smiles on our faces. This movie is fantastic and you should see it. And if seeing it in an RPX theater is an option, pony up the extra couple of dollars and experience this film the way it deserves to be. ",6jxijs

Really fun movie, the stakes felt heavy and real which is huge in a heist movie. The music was great and the way they made it tie into the film felt very ""Edgar Wright"" which is a huge bonus. I'm a little underwhelmed with the lack of humor but the humor that was there during certain scenes was spot on. *Everyone played their role fucking perfectly, can't say enough about that.*
In the end it was a really cute love story that we've seen before but at the same time done in a way that was experimental and it paid off huge.

djhyg66,How do you guys think this compares to Edgar's other movies? I felt like it had less heart and less laughs than the cornetto trilogy but those are hard to beat. The action was better and the music was a standout,6jxijs
djhyili,"No joke, it's been an hour and my heart-rate is still up from this movie. I'm sure some will continue to champion one of the cornetto films as Wright's best, but for me i think this movie takes the spot now. Everything about this movie worked for me,; from the jukebox musical, the action, the deconstruction of the romanticizing that goes into a lot of crime thrillers. If I had to point out a flaw it would be that there were a couple of times where the dialog felt like it was trying to be a little too clever, but even then it feels like nitpicking. I'm gonna give my mind some time recollect itself but this feels like an all-timer to me.",6jxijs

All the little details and sounds were timed really well, like car doors slamming and keeping pace with the songs (just pay attention to every edit and sound effect with the beat). Like Mad Max, even though the movie moves at a breakneck pace in service to the songs and the car chases, its all legible and very well choreographed, which is especially important for a movie like this one that has only a handful of moments to catch its breath. I would love to hear your guys' feedback on this. ",6jxijs
dji177w,I cant Wait for Baby to join the Fast and furious team.   all Kidding aside having only seen 1 trailer for this movie when seeing Free Fire. I was blown away by this movie considering the only thing i remember from the trailer was the mike myers joke  and the red car driving shots   hell I forgot it was an edgar wright film till the open scene  I don't think My theater was prepared for the amount of people though even if it was an early release they put it in there smallest theater and it was at  80%capacity  before the previews had started    this is definitely in my top 5 of the year  so far   ,6jxijs

Lost my shit at that scene, it was just the funniest thing I've seen in a very long time.

Also, the movie was really enjoyable, I just wish, still, that people could film decent action scenes. The cuts were pretty annoying considering the movie it was. Granted, he did it because yea, go with music n stuff, but I mean, with a car chase, it should be like that shot where he's weaving in the alley to dodge the truck, multiple long shots to understand where the car is going, why he's drifting there, not just to look stylish, but to go on the journey with him. 3-5+ cuts for one drift is as unnecessary as 2+ cuts for 1 punch. That's my only nitpick.",6jxijs

dkc6vye,"This movie reminded me so much of Shoot 'Em Up, where car culture rather than gun culture was the main focus. 

The thing is though that using Shoot 'Em Up as a benchmark really drove home to me how little soul and fun was contained in Baby Driver. Visually it was beautiful but it lacked heart and soul in my opinion. Likes white man playing jazz. It was stylish as tuck, but so blatantly so in almost a pandering way saying ""please be impressed by my ability to edit X.""  Whereas Shoot 'Em Up just looks like a flick where folk came together to have some fun. ",6jxijs
djpmqvo,Movie is a work of art. I noticed most of the main characters who died didn't definitely die. ,6jxijs
djjllqg,"Without a doubt my favorite movie of the past 3 years I think. Haven't felt that exhilarated in a long time. Someone else already said it, but deaths had CONSEQUENCES. If someone died, the plot would change. Entirely. And anyone could! And die, they did. The tempo of the editing matched with the music manifests into a feeling of total fear. I.E windshield wipers in the first scene.  

I think at times the style of editing hindered the film. This was evident in the gun battles. That being said, this restriction also helped the final product by creating something new entirely. He remained consistent to this style for a solid 60-70% of the film so it worked. Loved it. Also, difficult to pull off so kudos to the sound editors, designers and especially the editor.  

Sound mix was awesome. I could understand every line, every object whooshed and panned right to left when it passed the camera. Easy pan, but a LOT of objects passed the screen. So this baby had care.  

Criticisms:  
Dialogue felt off to me at times. Perhaps the pacing. Or the cheesy 50's diner vibe writing inside of an action thriller. Eh, again, I'll deal with it. Every time he lost a cop car in the beginning, another one would show up RIGHT AWAY. And they didn't show the helicopter before he went under the underpass, so you didn't know what he was doing right away. And holy shit he stole like 15 cars at the end. That's it honestly.  

I got so many Tarantino vibes. Pulp fiction meets Reservoir Dogs. Go see this fucking movie.  


Edit: One more criticism might be that it felt like 2 films combined into one. Diner film vs. action driver film. But again, I think this may work because in the end [they get away happily ever after and the two films finally combine.](#spoiler)

djiizkb,"Overall I really enjoyed it. Obviously the music/soundtrack editing was phenomenal. Stylistically, this is definitely a Wright film, I love his shot composition and style. Jamie Foxx was great. There were however, a few moments that struck me as odd or out of place. 

[For instance, the ""good Samaritan"" Army guy that tried to stop them, at first, was believable. He gets to his car and opens his center console to grab a pistol, sure. But then all of a sudden he pulls out a machine gun that just happened to be sitting on his seat? And he continues to chase them down even when the police are involved? It was hard to suspend my disbelief on that one. Also, Kevin Spacey's flip at the end to sacrifice himself seemed out of character. Sure, he always defended Baby but that seemed over the top.](#spoiler)

It was just brilliantly executed all around, fairly original, extremely well paced, great soundtrack (duh), funny, the actions scenes were amazing and well shot, the scenes without action (like when the gang visit the diner for the first time) were even more tense, the characters played off each other amazingly, despite appearing to be nothing but simple thugs at first.

djpswwc," It's not meant to be taken literal, this is a film you could easily follow with minor distractions as it's not the most convoluted piece of storytelling, but it has its place. The use of music as guidance to what could happen and the angles this film manages to put on display are nothing short of invigorating. The off-beat shoot-out syncopation and the crazed, almost dizzying array of colours that concoct the car chases make this film a proof that, though a dying art, attempts at non-conventionalism can be interesting sights. Mostly the wisp of character developments that occur in here represents the biggest burden the film entails. 6.5/10",6jxijs

djpt7w2,"I found Baby as the least inspiring protagonist in any modern-day action movie. Even 'The Driver' in Drive was painfully solemn, but had swagger and mystery. Baby is essentially an autistic millenial version of Billie Elliott, who has out of nowhere acquired immense driving skills and the ability to perform sign language. Each characters story gets thrown at us, with no time to give reason as to why we ended up here, other than his parents car crash. Debora is the dullest love interest, completely lacking any decent lines or purpose other than a get away partner. WHO THE FUCK SENDS A PRISONER POSTCARDS OF ROUTE 66!

So many plot holes it almost felt as shocking as The Room at points. Kevin Spacey gets blasted with shotgun shells yet can finish his sentence to get run over. Yes, it's an action film, but this scene was retarded. 

I never thought the banality of listening to a song through shitty iPod headphones could merit doing more than 1 take and being part of a Hollywood movie that is somehow critically acclaimed. ",6jxijs
djm6cn3,"I was excited for this movie just for the sole reason that it was one of the only movies coming out this summer that was't a fucking sequel. However it fell short for me. 

 * The protagonist ""baby"" was just portrayed awfully. I couldn't tell whether it was the actor or the writing but I tend to lean towards it being the actor just because I felt like all the side characters were fairly well constructed.

 * The opening sequence, while visually well done was a huge turn off to me for so many reasons and honestly it just made me hate the main character the entire time. 
 
* The resolution of the movie.... oh wait there fucking wasn't a resolution it was just a bunch of lazy bullshit that played terribly
 
* On the plus side visually the movie was very well done, cinematography, lighting, directing, soundtrack, were all done beautifully which sort of redeemed it for me.

After the introduction of his foster dad, Baby could basically do no wrong, because...well he's got a black, invalid, deaf foster dad that he takes care of and everyone can just go awwwwwww. Second thing that made me go...""what?"" was when they randomly told us his name was Miles. I don't understand where that came from. Did I miss something? Like...I thought the whole point of Baby was that everyone in the posse had some kind of nickname and the funny/interesting thing was that Baby, thought to be a nickname, was actually his real name. But no, all of a sudden, the last 2 min of the movie, there's a ""oh by the way his name is Miles, the end."" Last thing was that Baby's and deborah's relationship wasn't fully developed. I understand that they probably did that as a little joke to show how they're immature and poke fun at that sort of thing in movies, but they still didn't spend enough time on them together.

djjmm1t,"This movie was atrocious. Besides an excellent opening, there are so many dead scenes with no emotional impact or investment. So many moments where I noticed the theater audience was devoid of any energy as the characters just blabbed for minutes at a time.

A horribly executed attempt at a romance and a character who just completely flips at the end. The last 30 minutes of the movie is completely outrageous.

Why would Doc's character go from someone who betrayed Baby to now suddenly someone whose going to protect him just because his GF showed up? That made absolutely no sense. And Jamie Foxx's character was just a straight unlikable douchebag. Baby just completely flips as well into some psycho maniac! Not that we knew anything about him before that, because he had no character development just like everybody else.

EIGHTY SIX METACRITIC. Have we lost our minds? Literally every other scene, especially in the middle of the movie, was a borefest. The girl starts talking about her family as if the audience cares at that point! She was just introduced! That's not when you hit us with the, ""Oh, my life is so bad please feel sympathy for me.""

Also I like how Ansel Elgort was playing Elvis throughout the whole movie and how Jon Hamm randomly played the main antagonist towards the end of the film when it would've made more sense thematically for John Bernthal's character to fill that role.

Every movie these days has to be in some landmark city like New York or London or San Francisco or Hong Kong or **or* has to draw great attention to the fact that it takes place in the what is considered to be a sub-par class of city, but I just kept thinking through the whole movie how great it was that instead of any of these other ""popular"" cities, he decides to have the movie in Atlanta, Georgia. Which, to be fair is a bit of a trend with Edgar Wright.

*Not so long ago in the distant realm of Toronto, Canada, Scott Pilgrim was dating a high schooler...*",6jxijs

djpx4c7,"Forget the gunfighting, just the way that he blocked out scenes and action in general.

Something I once heard was that what makes gunfights interesting isn't necessarily what the character is doing or how ""badass"" it is or whatever, but how you utilize the space in which the scene is taking place. 

So, if you have to people shooting at each other from behind cars, what is more interesting than both people using the cars as cover and just trading back and forth? Maybe using the mirrors to spot each other out, maybe shooting directly through the windows, maybe shooting underneath by the tires, etc. These are just spitball ideas but you get the point.

And this movie took that idea to another level not only with gunfights but every choreographed scene in the film.

""What's an interesting way of sending someone on a coffee run?""

""What's an interesting way of having someone run from the police?""

""How does a getaway driver elude the police?""

That last example is something I have to wonder whether or not Wright was playing on, because in that sense the entire movie felt like a car chase. Not like Mad Max, but how does a getaway driver actually elude the police? He (Wright) uses the environment and creativity to take routes and pull manuevers that his followers aren't expecting.

Just like Baby using public park tables to cut across an open space and get to a pathway with higher elevation. Just like he goes down an ""up"" escalator and then jumps across to the other side and goes down the ""down"" one. Just like how there is a foreshadowing in the diner when the cop goes through the doors that lead to the bathroom and when we turn back to it expecting the cop, it's just another waitress. And then when we turn back again expecting Buddy to pull his gun, it's actually Baby who's pulled a gun on Buddy.

This movie really just makes me want to make a video essay about it called ""Baby Driver: Being a Getaway Director or Getting The Most Out Of Your Locations' Environments.""",6jxijs

Edit to add: Wait, when he was holding up the banana to his ear, wasn't he mouthing I can't hear you to Joseph? If so, that's an awesome bit of foreshadowing about Doc not hearing bananas after the deal went sideways!",6jxijs

However, I do think the dialogue at times was a bit over the top to the point of it being cheesy and even tedious at times. Again, I thought the movie was great, but I thought it certainly had its flaws within the writing. That being said, the editing and score were so expertly done as well as the action pieces that it eclipsed any issues I had with the writing overall!

I didn't like the mint condition Cadillac being real, though. Once it faded to color, I was really hoping it would cut to the reverse and it would have turned into some average-ass car that it would make sense for Debora to have.  
  
But as it is, I saw it as kind of a mix between dream and reality. Baby really is being released from prison into Debora's loving arms and waiting car, but he's idealizing it a bit in his head to match the dream -- the perfect lighting, open road, and sparkling vintage convertible. ",6jxijs

dji2djz,"For me, this is why the diner scene with Bats was the most intense part of the film",6jxijs
djmqscn,"It was amazing. Most other films, they would have been robbing Fort Knox, or stealing the Hope Diamond.

In this, they were robbing a fucking post office. I've seen heist films where they were doing much much more, but it didn't feel like it had that much weight or was that serious. They weren't using night vision goggles or driving an Aston Martin with an oil slick and ejector seat while stealing the crown jewls. They were wearing shop glasses with LEDs on them, being chased in a sedan, and stealing mail order slips.

The realism made it feel, well, real.",6jxijs

djmasg5,"I feel like there could have been an extra scene to better facilitate his change of heart, but you are right; through the film he sticks up for Baby when the other crims poke fun at him, and it's said that he's used Baby on every job since they met, which is implied to not be the case for any other criminal he associates with. Plus, since Bats shot up the arms deal with the crooked police, it's likely Doc knew there would be repercussions coming his way and saw a chance to help a couple of young kids escape the underworld before he died.
EDIT I also think Doc respected Baby for standing up for himself and what he wanted, by blowing the post office job and killing Bats.",6jxijs

I don't think he said he let him steal it but if he did it could have been to have the leverage to get a guy with those balls (and driving skills) working for him. If so it worked well. 

He made money directly toward his owed balance until it was paid off. We even saw him given money then alone (without the rest of the crew) give it back as it was owed money. He owed a lot (perhaps interest?) and therefore was left with none to spend until he did have some to spend. 

He assumed baby would continue to drive for him bc he threatened to kill everyone he loves, pretty much a trope in a million movies that makes sense. To suggest he could have seen that baby would snap and flip and win in the end is to call out every movie with a villain, ever, IMO. He probably figured baby was a kid and could be forced to work for him. I think he just hires assholes because assholes are criminals (and play good bad guys in movies) I doubt he was hiring people specifically to mess with baby over their actual usefulness to the heist... In fact he defends him at times and makes sure he holds his own in other. People who do bad stuff are just often bad people. Again this is certainly not unique to this film. 

Baby records everything for exactly the reason he says. The movie is more about his obsession with music than anything else IMO. Maybe that was just how I watched it... recording the world around him in public has never gotten him in trouble before. I am not even sure it IS illegal depending on how you use it (he wasn't selling anything). Its easy to grab recording from everyday life. People do it all the time for musical experimentation. I thought it was pretty awesome how the movie explored so many old and new methods of sampling and mixing. Even the majority of the songs in the soundtracks were songs that people know more from their sampled use in hip-hop than the actual original song. 

There is no way that guy was a random guy with SMGs in his car. It did rub me the wrong way at first too and could surely use more context clues... but either he was an undercover detail with the armored transfer or someone was onto the crew ahead of time (we know Doc re-uses people). If not then you are correct about that one. (i did see where you explain he says on TV he's random. so maybe that was dumb. or there's more to the story they don't share, also dumb haha).

dqe8d5r,"> He tells Baby, ""You know I don't use the same exact group more than once, right?"" which at the time I took to mean ""You won't have to deal with Bats again"". Except naw, he's right fucking there in the very next heist he puts together.

The only problem I had with the movie. But I guess they had already built up those characters Wright just didn’t want to throw them away? Maybe we just misunderstood what was meant by the same crew? When he first said it i thought he meant no one on the crew was the same, that’s why Baby was so important. The first two crews we saw were completely different except for Baby.

djlbahc,"Jesus it took me way to long to get down to this comment.  I'm not trying to shit on the people who loved it.  I get it, I enjoyed this movie, but Bats, Joseph and Darling were probably the only well fleshed out characters. Not that they were amazing but they didn't go off on some weird tangent that seemed completely out of place.  Bats had me nervous the whole time he was on screen.  Darling played loose and had a wild and free spirit attitude.  But Buddy's turn as the bad guy, I mean yes they explain the whole seeing red thing, But I felt like showing that could have helped me believe it more because prior to the diner scene, he was too nice to Baby and a little too carefree like Darling.  The other part that bothered me is that he all the sudden becomes this great shot after Darling dies and gets pretty methodical/tactical with his shooting but prior to that he is just running through huge open spaces with his back to 4-5 cops who for some reason are just running after rather than taking aim and shooting them.  I'm sure I'm being nit picky but it bugged me.

I'm sure people will point out to me that he's a former Wall Street guy, not a former marine or something.  All I can say is... exactly, he is a former Wall Street guy, and he shouldn't have gotten away from the cops that many times.  Don't get me wrong, I though Jon Hamm did a great job throughout this film but the last 1/3 just fell apart for me.

Kevin spacey was fantastic in the first 2/3's and it's not like his acting was bad in the last 1/3 but there was no motivation whatsoever for him to all the sudden be super nice guy/take a bullet for you.  I mean he threatens to kill him and his girlfriend if he doesn't do the job.  The turn just didn't work.

You've said enough about Debora so I don't feel the need to elaborate.  I felt it was acted well, but the bonding scene at the laundromat, while fine, didn't take me to the crazy in love that I think it was supposed to.

I liked the movie, I probably had too high of expectations going into it and will have to see it again but that won't happen till it's out digital so I guess we'll see what some time does for it.

Happy to discuss if you disagree.",6jxijs
djie1v3,"Honestly I kinda think the whole fact that Debora and Baby are so entangled with each other can be just put upon the ""heightened musical reality"" of the film. Characters are all behaving in heightened and somewhat whimsical ways that all serve the story. Like in all musicals the characters seem to be always in an over the top joyous mood. But I mean it also could just be a bit of under-developed writing but it wasn't really an issue for me until the ending which I felt went on too long.",6jxijs
djhw0pl,"Edgar Wright is great, but he can't write female characters.",6jxijs
djhy3qz,I agree with you on these points. Technically it was a very well made movie... the writing was slopping though with certain characters doing certain things that just didn't seem to jive with their established modus operandi. Like Jamie Foxx's character is paranoid about everything going according to plan & then another character faces consequences for being sloppy.... and then he decides to be sloppy by choice later. Or the main boss just flipping his switch with Baby after everything fell apart when he clearly showed beforehand that he didn't take shit from anyone. And Debora barely knew Baby... she's gonna get wrapped up in the insanity after going on 1.5 dates with him? HA. This movie needed more character development and consistency.,6jxijs
dji0170,"[It seemed like, after the bad arms deal, Baby had a couple of legit opportunities to walk away, and didn't. That kind of bugged me, until I realized that the reason he didn't was likely because Bats would kill him if he did, having already been pretty clear on how he felt about people backing out on things.](#spoiler)",6jxijs
djith79,"I agree with the character development. Baby's character didn't seem consistent through the film. The upbeat dancing from the beginning of the story didn't seem like it matched the quieter character of Baby with Debora. And it didn't seem like that was due to any kind of change in his character. The sunglasses also seemed a little random. Had there been backstory on the sunglasses like there was for the iPods with the tinnitus I could see that working, but him wanting to wear them constantly just made it seem like he was trying to be cool.

dmzb91f,"> One thing I didn't get, what the fuck was up with the random dude in the blue pick up during the armored truck heist? Was that just some rando who had a mp5 in his backseat and willing to chase down armed robbers or...? Is that like a common thing to have someone undercover following armored trucks?

Truck guns are a common thing in some parts of the country. Some guys even keep roof Koreans in their trucks, usually for times recent to natural disasters or media-induced rioting. I think it would have been better if they had like a few dudes in a truck, and gave them a tiny bit of dialogue- a little exposition I guess, to get the point across. Instead, they had like Dodge-MP5-assassin dude going ham. What's his face did mention that they ""have a hero"" on their hands.

>Doc goes from ""fuck you"" to ""run away I'll sacrifice myself"" in like 30 seconds just because he sees Baby has a girl friend?

This was believable to me simply because he seemed like quite a softy from the get-go. He really should have just straight up killed Baby for what he pulled, but Spacey would never do that because he likes the kid, and he's a big softy in the first place. Also, he thought he was getting away clean. It wasn't even the cops that showed up, it was Buddy. So, he had practically nothing to lose by helping Baby a bit, and also he got to see Baby's motivations for everything he did. Lastly, he tells Baby to run because, by that point, he knows he's fucked. 

I just realized, once you hear someone's real name, they're next to die.

>I can't say that Buddy's vengeance isn't reasonable... but that whole plot line just seemed unnecessary and is when the movie went from great to just another cheesy action film.

>I don't know, I think my expectations were maybe too high, but I really did love the first half of the film.

I actually kind of liked it, in a general sense, because Bats was made out to be the big villain, but he was swiftly dealt with, and it was Buddy (appropriate name) who was kind and friendly with Baby, who ultimately became the bad guy, antagonist, and arch nemesis, and for the same reasons that Baby inadvertently fucked up Baby's shit in the first place. It was Bats that was thought to be a huge threat, to practically everyone too, but it was Buddy who became Baby's biggest threat toward Deborah. 

>okay, kind of justifiable I guess, he was a piece of shit murderer. But then shoots Buddy and doesn't hesitate to hold some randoms dudes at gunpoint for their car. Seems kind of weird that the guy who was so obviously trying to stop the killing going on around him then kills.

He didn't though, not out of necessity. I just watched so it's still fresh in my mind, and it seems very intentional that Baby wasn't trying to kill Buddy at all; he just wounded him in order to get away. Even with Bats, it seems Baby killed him specifically because, in the scene previous, Baby's tapes outed Deborah as his love interest. He doesn't try to kill Buddy though, not until the end when Buddy's in rampage mode.

A lot of the writing was very meh to me too though. Not the overall plot, I don't think, but some of the dialogue. Otherwise, it's a romp.",6jxijs

djmfm2f,"you're not the real 420bootywizard are you?  if so, i'm a big fan.

i don't really know why baby didn't let doc call off the last heist too, maybe he was concerned bats knew about deborah, but he clearly didn't know until he found the tapes.  also his decision to kill bats by ramming the back of that truck and then fleeing on foot.  i mean, he kinda was responsible for getting buddy's wife killed.  seems like all of that made it more likely he'd get caught and put deborah in harm's way, no? he knew doc knew about her from the start and then he intentionally fucks up the heist.  i know he was upset about bats killing an innocent security guard, but that whole part of the movie doesn't really add up to me either.

but i agree, so much of it was brilliant anyways, and i think i might just need to see it again to understand better",6jxijs

dlj97qg,">I honestly thought Doc was going to be the""big bad""

I think that was the intention, or at least that's how I saw it. 

Spacey's character has next to no emotion... even when telling the most emotional story about how he took Baby under his wing and helped him become who he is today, it's all delivered completely monotone and devoid of any love or care... 

So the unexpectedness of Doc's change of heart worked for me because it put some color on an otherwise grayscale character. Doc risks his life/work/everything for Baby because of love (ultimately Baby's ""love""), reciprocating Baby risking his life for Doc all those years :) 

Consider the loveless relationship between Doc and Baby despite Doc's fatherlike role... maybe Debora was the missing link?",6jxijs

I'm assuming Doc's profession got his ""love"" killed. He saw a piece of himself in Baby, and realized he was taking it too far with him, showing some humanity in him. It almost felt like despite the threats to Baby, he viewed him as a relative/child in comparison to his other crew members.

Doc realized that it was over for him, and Baby did his service and found his own love, so he found no point in dragging the two down with him. 

Man I loved this movie",6jxijs

djy9aw3,"Jon Hamm's character was the most interesting to me with the hinted back story about a guy that went down a dark path.  He was kind of played up as a sympathetic character that took a genuine interest in Baby.  Felt kind of off for him to suddenly go full cop killing, Terminator villain rather than find redemption.  

I'd have liked to have seen him go off the rails after Darling died, and maybe even pursue Baby to the diner intent on revenge.  But when he took that earbud from Baby, it was a great callback to earlier in the film when Darling was alive and he and Baby bonded a bit, and a moment for his character to have to make a final choice.  Buddy was much more likely to see in Baby and Deb, what he saw in himself and Darling, and be the one who would help them.  With no Darling, and seeing Baby and Deb together like they were, it could be the impetus for him to make a sacrifice for them and to find his own final redemption.  That would have completed his arc in a more satisfying way, and that sacrifice would have felt more believable than Spacey's no-nonsense, streetwise character to say ""I won't help you.  I won't help you.  I won't help you.  Oh, you met a pretty girl.  Well, it must be true love then.  In that case, here's evidence against me, here's a bag of cash, and I'll help you get away.""  Not that it was unreasonable for Buddy to just turn full villain after Darling's death, he was a disturbed character, but that's exactly what would make that moment feel like he was making a real choice as a character.

As it was, Buddy just became generic ""Final Obstacle Guy"" which could have been anyone or anything at no real loss.  It didn't *have* to be Buddy for the finale fight to be just as good in the way Neo *had* to fight Agent Smith or Johnny Ringo *had* to fight Doc Holiday (any others and those finale fights wouldn't have been as meaningful).  You could work in Spacey, Bats, John Bernthal's character, etc and have gotten the same fight.  It's a car chase movie, so instead of a fight with Buddy in a parking garage, why not have an amazing finale car chase to end on?  Baby either gets away and the two go on the run like Bonnie & Clyde (leaving an easy way into the suggested sequel), or the same end result - they're finally blocked in, and Baby finally gives up rather than putting Debora into any more danger.  I would have liked to have seen a final chase sequence that was the best and saved for last.

That said, I really enjoyed the film, thought the tinnitus/music spin on things was brilliant, and this is just nitpicking things as an armchair quarterback to try to make it even better than it already was (and not even sure it wouldn't be making it cliche and worse).  There are definitely flaws and room for improvement.  It was just so close to going from pretty good to absolutely great.",6jxijs
djxdkwd,"Totally agree, it turned into fast & furious for a bit then just got silly and went to shit. I still liked it quite a lot but the reviews are way too positive overall. It felt a bit like EW had seen what a soundtrack can do for sci-fi in Guardians of the Galaxy and applied the same to heist. 

The syncing battles to music was well overplayed too - it's the same idea from Shaun of the Dead but spread too thickly over the whole movie.

I loved the humour though, if the movie was dialled back and shorter and stayed within it's own universe it could easily have been a classic",6jxijs
djxur19,"I agree that those parts didn't quite ring true, but changing them would have missed some crucial emotional beats. If Jon Hamm died in the diner, what would the climax be? Baby vs. Cops? Kinda undercuts his moral compass throughout the film, trying to spare the innocent. Baby vs. Bats? You'd have to undo that brilliant death and make the final villain that much more predictable and less emotionally complex. I will grant you that they should have built up Hamm's driving skills more, so he didn't seem outclassed the moment he got behind the wheel against Baby.

And given that Baby's driving and music listening were both ways of running away from the pain of his mother's death, the story has to resolve with him stopping driving, and hearing his own music from within. The prison stuff stretched a bit, but felt like a solid compromise between giving Baby the ending he deserved and making it too sunshine and roses. The tone of the movie wouldn't suit a tragic Bonnie and Clyde ending or a fable-ish Raising Arizona coda.",6jxijs
djxqs1w,"With Kevin Spacey, he was in an elevator with two people that were being ""hunted"" if you will. More than likely if Baby and Deb were gonna get killed he was going to be killed as well, so he just decided to go out with a fight and as soon as he got shot he realised that he was gonna die anyway so he went out helping Baby. Thats how I saw it anyway , I know my formatting of this response is terrible, sorry about that.",6jxijs

* The 0 pattern translates to zero or British: naught.

* The ur translates to your.

* BUD and E turn into Buddy.

* But 0 your buddy or naught your buddy doesn't make sense.

* BUT naught is a homonym (sounds the same) with not.

I would add just add one thing: the whole ""are you in?""/ ""am I in?"" bit is a further indication of that. At first, Doc forces Baby to work, then he releases his grip a bit on him, which then leads to, in Doc's words, ""time to make a big boy decision"". Here, I think, is the moment that Baby starts to think by himself, while still being a subordinate. His complete independence comes later, I think.

In my eyes, the moment you talked about is when Doc fully lets go of Baby. That moment is him saying ""my work here is done"" and releasing Baby to the world as his ideal criminal, that is professional, effective and **emotional**, while still being calculating to a degree.",6jxijs

djizuyj,"Baby's arc was a little fuzzy for me as well, but I do think he changed.  

In the very beginning, one of the characters warns, ""You think you're better than us?"" and goes on about how Baby's never really had blood on his hands. For Baby, driving is almost like a game. He's drumming on the steering wheel, singing along, having a blast. But, ultimately, he has to get his hands dirty.   

Baby tries to make a run for it (after lying to Spacey about being in and how they should all ""get some sleep"") but gets caught by Hamm and Foxx in the parking garage. This escape attempt is the first time Baby takes charge of his own fate. Prior, he's just doing exactly what Spacey tells him to. 

Baby's big change happens when [he kills Jamie Foxx](#spoiler). He goes from being non-violent to violent. Hamm is a character who was not a born criminal, but simply got in over his head (like Baby). He embraces violence completely and revels in it. He's a shadow of what Baby could become. In that sense, Hamm makes sense as a final villain (although he wasn't as scary as Foxx). 

That theory of his arc might explain the shift in tone as well. Baby's world is bubblegum until Jamie Foxx does his thing at the first robbery. Baby thinks he's out of the game after that, then realizes he can never get out because the crime world doesn't operate on fairness - Spacey's deal was a lie.  

Not really sure why he went along with the final robbery though. Was it because he thought they had his foster dad? Jamie Foxx rolls up in the wheelchair like, ""He's not going anywhere"". Maybe he thought something bad would happen to foster dad and Debora? 

Spacey's turn at the end seemed odd to me as well. Thinking back on it, he did have a fatherly vibe and was protective of Baby. (I'm reaching here, bear with me) Spacey didn't seem to have kids (just a nephew), so he might have seen Baby like a son. Foxx and company are the ones who go to his house and grab his foster dad - it's not an order we see Spacey give. Spacey makes threats, but we never see him do any violence toward Baby. He might have had a soft spot for him, but was cold enough to use threats to get what he wanted. Baby is super valuable to him and he knows he'll respond to threats because he's soft. 

Agree on the love story. I think it might have suffered because Debora wasn't much of a character. She seemed like she was around to like Baby and that Baby was using her to replace his mother -- a woman who waits on him/feeds him and sings. 

Since you're on the poetic license tip -- did you think it was weird that the ""hero"" at the Foxx bank robbery pursued them so relentlessly? And had a machine gun? I thought he was going to turn out to have been hired by Spacey to screw up the robbery, thus getting Foxx/Baby arrested and linked to the other string of robberies so Spacey could be cleared. But he was really supposed to be some random dude? 

And I agree he'd be doing life. He's an accessory to murder. One way they could have made it work is if he used the recordings he had to help the state's case and take down Spacey. The state will cut informants/rats serious slack if it simplifies the case. And he could have gotten Debora off (ba-dump!) if he told the cops he kidnapped her, but we never saw him do that, soooooo... can't really make that case.  

You make some excellent points!",6jxijs
djr2zhi,"You seem pretty hell-bent on disliking the movie.  There's pretty straightforward answers to most of these, but whatever, I'm not going to talk you out of your disenjoyment.

The reason I say that is because the first one is so obvious.

>What was Baby Driver's arc? How did he change? He was two-dimensional the whole movie.

He froze.  All the characters exhibited the flight, fight, or freeze response.  Baby's was always flight, and very rarely fight (like the scene in the diner).  The thugs were always fight, and Deborah's was freeze.

He finally realized how much danger he was putting other people in with his actions.  He thought he could out run everything, and right at that moment he realized he couldn't.

He got several people killed, and they kept yelling at him, ""This is your fault.""  He put his foster dad in danger.   He was putting Deborah in danger.

He woke up from the nap and was in the passenger seat of the car, the same place his dad was sitting when his parents died.  He blames his dad's actions for distracting the driver when his parents died, and he was about to do the same for his newfound soulmate.  He was about to put Deborah's life in danger in the same way his dad put his mom's life in danger.

That was his arc.  He finally decided to stop running.  He stopped drowning out the ringing, he stopped hiding his face, and he stopped moving.",6jxijs
djiz29r,"I quite liked the movie. Totally respect your opinion but I thought I might be able to answer some of your questions based on my reading of the movie.

1. I quite liked the change in tone. I went in expecting more of a lighthearted film but what we got was a really really great suspense film. Also the tonal change didn't feel jarring to me but rather seemed to flow with the slowly rising tension.

2. The soft-hearted kid slowly becomes like people he fears in order to get what he wants. Maybe not a ""character improvement"" arc but definitely an arc.

3. Agree with this. Wish there were longer shots but I also think it would have reduced the amount of time they could have cut to the music which was kinda the main hook of the film. I didn't have much trouble following the geography of the driving until the final showdown in the parking garage, but that had more to do with all the flashing lights.

4. Remember how Doc kept asking Baby ""if he was in?"" without actually giving him a choice throughout the movie? I think Baby was reading the question the same way. He had never been able to say no to Doc before, so why now? Also, I got the impression he feared pissing off Bats any more, so he choose the plan where he could be long gone by morning.

5. Can't really answer definitively, but this didn't really bother me so much because it suggested more about Doc's opinion of Baby that he was previously hiding. 

6. Probably cause he needed leverage to convince Baby to to say yes, but in reality would have never actually gone that far (as hinted by the ending). I get the impression from this movie that Doc's attitude is a facade to cover his true feelings about people. Probably helps him work with psychopaths. Come to think of it, it kind of harkens back to Bat's line about ""the minute you catch feelings, is the minute you catch a bullet""

7. Also not really something that personally concerned me, mainly because the film is kind of a love at first sight fairy tale. I did feel that Baby and Debora has great chemistry however. When did he lie to her? Sure he didn't explain the full story but I don't remember him straight up telling her a falsehood.

8. I'm pretty sure he only killed Bats & Buddy and the first could be played of as an ""accident"" and the other as self-defense. As for the sentencing I don't really know, it's not like the film goes into details on his exact charges. I personally didn't really care since it was more a of fairy tale ending anyway in line with much of the rest of the movie.

djrmxki,">A prime example of this is when Doc has JD killed for dropping a gun, but leaves Bats alone despite gunning down an entire team of bent cops.

He has JD killed as an example. Bats killing the cops basically burned their operation. He could kill him but it wouldn't make much of a difference since if he did he couldn't go through with the op. And also Buddy wound up back Bats' story, so Doc didn't really have a choice.

>And I don't really buy Doc's change of heart or the flimsy handwaving the screenplay tries to justify it with

This one's a little tougher but I think that Doc had a genuine admiration for Baby, possibly even as a father figure. He's the only person Doc's worked with on every heist, he's known him for a decade and you might even be able to argue that he loves him. Doc probably realizes he's fucked at the end one way or another so he decides to do the noble thing.

>nor Buddy suddenly trying to channel Anton Chigurh when the way Darling dies is almost completely her fault

I don't really get this complaint. He shouldn't be mad that his wife died because it was sort of her fault? She still died, and that's traumatic because he loved her, and also it was still Baby that fucked up the heist in the first place. Also he's a dangerous unhinged criminal to begin with.

> nor Baby and Debora's relationship moving as fast as it does, to be honest.

People say stuff like this and I feel like they fundamentally misunderstand what the movie was meant to be. It's a fairy tale, a throwback. It's meant to be disconnected from reality to a certain extent. Obviously that doesn't mean that the characters and their actions shouldn't make a certain amount of sense, but when a man's love for his dead wife is what strains credulity for you, you're probably overanalyzing it just a tad.",6jxijs

dk13gg2,"I also liked the movie, but I feel the exact opposite. I think this was his shift from polished films with great writing to a stylish genre film. The Cornetto Trilogy are all very emotionally driven films with focus on themes of friendship and maturity. This was Edgar Wright making a popcorn movie. A great popcorn movie don't get me wrong, and there are still plenty of themes and shit in there, but it's not quite as emotional as the Cornettos.",6jxijs
dk1312q,"""great writing"" seems like a stretch for me here. I guess the shallow romance comes to mind first. A lot of the dialogue was good. For me, the character development wasn't really fluid or interesting. But even if you do give Buddy and Batts some credit for their relatively intriguing characters, the whole plot of the story is pretty thin. It's basically 'good guy does bad things because life is unfair' and 'robbers pull off a few heists and then get caught and most of them die'",6jxijs
dk146go,"Don't be bummed when people like/dislike something you like/dislike.  It's not a slight against you :)

There were some great moments, especially in the third act, but that third act was just... so unbelievable.

Also, we know based on tre interaction with Bernthal's character how Baby reacts to these tough guy instigators. Foxx's character is just on another level with his aggression. When we see Baby react to him we wonder if he can really keep his cool with this guy like he did the last guy. Will that strategy even work?

He literally found him at a very young age breaking into his car. Even affectionately calling him Baby.

Because the film wasn't afraid to kill people, and those deaths have consequences, you really don't know if our protagonist will make it through.  

For example, the banana scene. In an ordinary film, hey he knocks of some cops. Whatever. Nope, he knocks off some cops because he loses his cool and 3 things happen. 1 - The boss doesn't get a call. Uh oh. 2 - Who will defend Jamie Fox? Suddenly there's a new dynamic. And Baby's allegiance is questioned. Finally 3, bad cops show up again.  

It's shit like this that is planted EVERYWHERE in this film. It pays off. Like the recorder. Which he uses to leave his step father at the old folks home.  

The lady saying he has good character because he throws the purse to her. It's like, the characters in this film don't just do things to show their character, they do things to advance the plot. And these things have consequences and change the story as a result. The world had meaning.

When Darling is killed it unleashes the monster inside of Buddy, he doesn't care about the money or anything else, he cared about Darling and Baby had that taken away from him. Baby had to pay for that.

Batts represents pure violence, he challenges Baby's naive conceptions that he can do this kind of business and not get blood on your hands. Baby routinely tries to isolate himself from or block out the violence these criminals commit believing in someway that it absolves him of responsibility. Notice how he changes the channel from the news anytime it starts to mention his heists? He's intentionally trying to block himself out from the hurtful consequences of his actions. Batts forces him to accept that when you enter this criminal world you have to be willing to get your hands bloody. Him killing Batts signifies a shift in his character, he's embraced the need for violence. After killing Batts he doesn't hesitate to shoot Buddy or point a gun at anyone to get what he needs.

EDIT:

I could go on but you'll also notice how Baby loses one of the lenses of hit sunglasses after killing Bats. This can be interpreted in two ways A) His vision is no longer clear anymore as his world has been turned upside down or B) he's seeing the real world clearly for the first time through his actual eyes. Of course, once he fully embraces violence he loses his sunglasses completely. He's fully entered the world instead of intentionally sitting in the passenger seat of his criminal schemes.

Speaking also on subverting expectations this exists in the soundtrack as well. At several points Edgar subverts expectations with songs that are famous these days because they are sampled in more modern songs. For example, ""The Edge"" by David McCallum is most know these days because it's sampled in Dr. Dre's ""Still D.R.E."" but rather than playing the more well known rap song he goes for the original track. This occurs several other times in the film. Hell, the opening chase of the film starts off with a subversion as Griff indicates for Baby to punch it, pointing his finger forward. Of course, Baby doesn't blast off forward but instead puts the car into reverse.",6jxijs

djsvp5z,"I agree with a lot of what you said. I think one thing Wright does incredibly well is he can create depth in a character while dragging them through drastic transitions of satire, parody, drama, and action all the while keeping them dynamic and building upon their complexities. In this film i feel as if he turned off that  method of consistency and his characters would deepen and then flatten depending on the tone of the narrative. I think there are examples to support this with each of the criminal characters, but I don't want to spoil any specific scenes( unless anyone is interested in further discussion). That inability to develop each character carefully while simultaneously exposing them to drastic tonal shifts resulted in inconsistencies that took me out of that immersive state I usually am while experiencing his work. For what it's worth, I had a blast in this film. I was at the edge of my seat for a lot of it.

When Baby returned Doc just saw someone like he was part of the crew, that he was just like any other crew member. That's why he was so hostile towards him before Debora showed up. 

When Debora showed up, he realized WHY Baby did what he did, and that he was just growing up and sticking up for himself, something he really didn't do during the meetings. He still saw that Baby was doing things for the right reasons.

For that part I felt there was about 15 minutes worth of backstory that was missing from the movie to explain the turn better and WHY Doc felt that way.

But he kept on giving Baby second chances. Even when they first met with Baby as a kid stealing from him. He has always given Baby wiggle room that no one else had. Also, Bats and Buddy were trigger happy killers. They had no problem killing people on the job and off the job. See how the gas station attendant ""disappeared"" after Bats went in for gum. BUT when they went to get the tapes from Baby's place, they let Joe live. They simply took his wheelchair to imply that he was dead.

They both have amazing soundtracks and they both star people who were in Mad Men - which is one of my favourite TV shows. 

Put a gun to my head however and I'd probably still say I liked Drive a little better. I just liked the slower pace and the mood it created. There was more tension, and characters got killed horribly by the bad guys. It's a case of less being more. Drive just had an enchanting presence about it.  

I still loved Baby Driver a great deal, it will require more viewings to truly appreciate the 'more' within it, all the little details and the many layers.

djnjzx8,"The same deal as World's End.  Edgar Wright's not interested in being funny anymore, but he doesn't know how to be serious.  You have ""Goodfellas Pizza"" as a reference so you can see how the structure of that movie would inform Baby Driver's.  Both films are about young criminals being swept up into a life of crime, and the first act of both films have fast editing and are brimming with energy.  Then you throw in a love interest, and a psychopathic teammate and bunch of other dramatic complications and suddenly the main character's world becomes a nightmare that they must escape in the much darker third act.  The difference is is that Goodfellas began with Joe Pesci stabbing a man to death in the trunk of his car.  So no matter how exuberant and seductive and funny that first act is you knew where the movie was going with it.  The movie primes you for the darkness and violence in the second half.  Baby Driver doesn't do that, so when you're introduced to Jamie Foxx's character who kills everyone he meets and cause problems it feels intrusive, like he belongs to another movie. That and the horrendously cliche romantic subplot with the waitress dragged the movie down.  The only saving grace of the third act was Jon Hamm getting to be relentless and despicable badass.

On a sidenote: hearing loss is no joke, it's why I'm terrified of going to any concert or venue that's too loud. Once your hearing is gone, it's gone. We still don't have a way to completely fix hearing loss, although there have been recent strides in the attempts to do so.

Right before killing Bats, Bats had killed two security guards, tried to kill a third, and killed a bunch others unprovoked. The last kill at the post office was the final straw for Baby.

I understand the kid gets a rush from driving, but the dancing and lip syncing was odd because it looked as if he was enjoying himself. I feel like if he was forced to do it he'd be a little more like Ryan Gosling in Driver. He'd be a little more tortured. 

I also really never felt any sympathy for him, nor was I excited for him. He was a member of rotten and unlikeable crews who abused and murdered their victims. Yet the next scene he's dancing for his lovable foster father who's like the comic relief of the film. 

Maybe if Baby was the driver for a different crew(not so evil), it wouldn't have seemed odd but I just didn't feel anything for him. The other thing that was weird was Spacey treated him like shit through the film, then at the end he's this funny, caring father figure. Wuh? ",6jxijs

dji5scu,"I might agree on most of the points. However I do think it's established that Bats would want to go in there (he was insistent on going into a generic Gas Station/he's generally pretty eclectic ) and Kevin Spacey DEFINITELY picked the tape because he knew her name was Deborah and wanted that manipulation/power. And of course Monica would make that connection, she's a hired gun who is paid to notice details, like most of them. I think those were pretty organic script moments. 

As for the unrealistic stuff, Edgar Wright has a movie about zombies with unexplained science and rules. But it's a fun movie that uses predetermined archetypes of monster flicks and paradigms within them to tell a subversive story that uses the ""unrealism"" and jarring tone to be funny. I found Baby Driver to be SUPER similar in that regard. Wright has a penchant for eschewing plot and realism for character beats and moments. It's a fairy tale movie and the movie has no problem admitting that. The side characters are larger than life, baby effectively has super powers, and the ending had a literal rainbow and sequences were shot black and white. Baby used an iPod! I think that a lot of the stuff that didn't work for you, and that's okay and we can have different opinions and wants out of certain movies, were deliberate choices by Wright and the editing team to tell a different and larger than life story, which is grounded in emotion instead of actual realism.

While it's fair to mention that Buddy survived 3 car attacks, the comment about him shooting twice next to Baby's ears deserves some discussion. 

The line immediately following these two shots was something along the lines of ""You took something I loved and now it's gone, so I'm taking something you love."" The easy thought and expectation is to go to Debora. Baby just admitted in the diner he loves her in front of Buddy, so we expect that Buddy will take the life of someone he's already and recently threatened, but he doesn't. 

The bullet isn't aimed at Baby's head or even Baby at all. No, it's a blow from someone who we've seen understands and respects Baby's love and need of music throughout the movie and even bonded over not long ago. But in his rage and loss, Buddy was vengeful and attacked something Baby loves deeply - music, subverting taking a shot at Debora, his recently admitted love. 

I audibly let out a muffled groan of sympathetic pain at that moment being a music lover. So while it's not killing Baby or even Debora, regardless of the outcome of the three people involved in the situation Buddy wanted to make sure that Baby suffered an emotionally devastating blow after this was over.

I hope this helps understanding of that choice a bit, as it was something that really resonated with me and you seemed to want to bring discussions that hadn't been had to this thread.

djq62vb,"I don't think a car chase would've been all that fun because Baby was obviously the best driver. No way Buddy would've been able to just keep up with him. If Buddy was a good driver, there would've been no point of Baby in the entire movie.

Doc changed his mind because the job fell apart and there was no future. He also respected Baby enough for being loyal and saw that Baby wanted out of the situation and he was in love. It wasn't a solid reason, but I didn't mind it.

I got the impression immediately that Bats and Baby were enemies so I guess that's all just interpretation. I don't think it was a matter of liking Baby enough to not kill her, but just a realization that they don't need any more heat right before a heist so it wasn't worth killing somebody for no reason.

No, I don't think he should've lost his hearing, especially considering how music essentially defined his character and his relationships. Tinnitus sucks enough. Being deaf would be such a tragedy for him.

The guy was pointed out as ex-military. You may have just missed it. That's why he had those guns.

",6jxijs
djq8spz,"Agree with most of this. Still, I gave the movie 5/5 stars. It was an insanely fun movie to watch.

The points I disagreed with you on was Bats and Baby being enemies. I don't think he spared Debora because he liked Baby, he probably just didn't want to escalate the situation at the moment. I never felt like there was any respect there throughout their time together, just begrudging acceptance until Bats found a reason to kill him. 

Also, I think she waits for him because even if they only knew each for a short time, it was a very life-changing experience for her. Not a stretch for her to wait for him considering that.

I think what they were going for there was a subversion; they set up Doc or Bats as the villain, and Buddy as the, well, buddy and then reverse them.  Doc definitely shows a lot of paternal affection for Baby throughout the movie.  But it did seem abrupt, going from ""fuck you"" to ""I was in love once"".

At the diner, I thought Baby essentially faced Bats down over holding the place up, I certainly didn't get any impression that it was out of respect or affection that he refrained.

",6jxijs
djqlsp9,"Doc did say ""I was in love once"".  ",6jxijs
djqu6jf,"1. This is foreshadowed way earlier in the movie with the bull fighting announcer saying something to the effect of ""he's off his horse now and has to rely on his feet."" Again Buddy is compared to the bull when Darling says ""When he sees red, you'll see black"" in the diner and of course this happens again when Buddy is covered in red in the police car. Plus another car chase might have been uninteresting and I think I enjoyed the more unconventional and asymmetric nature of this ""chase"" which really resembles a bull fight more than anything of course. 

2. I think that's kind of a fair point. If Doc even paused for 5 seconds or so when Deborah walked in I wouldn't have a problem. I think it's also possible to dismiss his earlier threats as being empty since Doc clearly does care about Baby but honestly that does seem like a stretch.

3. I don't know about you but I never felt like that was true. If anything it was Buddy that might have become his friend. Bats resents Baby for undercutting him and Baby resents Bats for carelessly killing people. 

4. I think it was a temporary thing or maybe a way for Baby to know it was time to face some responsibility for what he had done. I doubt temporary hearing loss from two gunshots would last that long in the first place but it makes some sense for the movie's sake, same with something like him getting knocked out for like 20 minutes which of course happens a lot in movies.

2.   Baby obviously didn't plan on botching the heist at the end, but tensions rose and Bats put a gun to his head.  Smart decision? No.  Emotional decision? Yes.



3.   Buddy being the main antagonist for the last acts works fine, Bats was obviously Baby's biggest ""enemy"", for lack of a better descriptor,  and during the heist Baby finally retaliated by killing Bats. Which was obviously the only realistic way to effectively get rid of him.  Buddy got the perfect foreshadowing IMO from Monica's speech in the diner, she painted him as a relentless killing machine if anybody truly enraged him.  One of the few things that we know about Buddy is that he's a creature of revenge so it makes complete sense that he would go after Baby after Monica dies.



4.  One of Baby's character traits is that he doesn't talk, especially not to cops, so it makes sense for his character to not go to the cops.

All the characters are inconsistent:

-[Buddy initially is portrayed as a ""good"" guy but does a 180, and its not even like a plot twist, it just sorta happens for no reason (Monica's death served no purpose to the story, it just made me not like a character I had initially liked)](#spoiler)

-Bats is sometimes quirky, sometimes psychotic and unstable, sometimes the villain. [His death is so unsatisfying, like there was no buildup to it](#spoiler).

-Deborah is immediately ok with Baby shooting people/doing bad things and overall felt like a great character wasted.

-Doc seems to be the bad guy but then does something ""heartwarming"" which was so out of character.

-Monica is sort of a neutral character but [she dies. What did this have to do with anything...it just left me confused and irritated](#spoiler)

Also there were loose ends...Monica saying Bats looked at her funny...And who was the guy with the baseball cap who started shooting them?

This movie was all over the place and while I enjoyed the soundtrack, it just left me frustrated because it had so much potential.

The soundtrack was hit or miss as well. It didn't always mesh well with the scene and it ruined the emotion of them on occasion.

You'll notice it was raining right when he noticed the mail woman on the last job who initially referenced Dolly Parton, and that's when Baby decided that he had to do what he did in the following scene.

Repeats himself when Baby thinks he's done with the jobs, but tells him he's doing another when Baby and Debora eat at the fancy resteraunt. Joe is his foster father that took him in after his parents died. For the parents fighting, that's left out.

djlzx6h,"Man, did you miss the point of the movie. The point of Baby is that he did not have his own voice, literally and figuratively. He barely talked in the beginning of the film. Even to the point where he told Debra in the laundromat that he had spoke more on that day while being with her than he had spoke in the past entire year. Doc had him on a leash. Baby was not allowed to do what he wanted which was to stop being a getaway driver. He didn't have a voice in that decision. Even at home, he didn't have a literal voice because his adopted father was deaf. So, they communicated through sign. Even when Baby was making his own music, he didn't use his own voice. He used everyone else's voice. It wasn't until the end that he found his voice. He began to speak more. He asserted himself. He even literally became Joe's voice when he left instructions on a recording when he dropped Joe off at the home. For the first time, instead of recording everyone else's voice, he recorded his own. 

And of course Baby's name was going to be revealed in the end. He ""grew up"" from being this person who didn't have a voice to someone who did. And the best way to do that was going to have it through the trial where his name was going to be revealed. Also, Miles is a pun. Edgar loves pun names. A getaway driver who has been driving for a huge chunk of his life called *Miles* as in a measure of driving distance? Come on, that's perfect 
Edgar. 

edit: grammar",6jxijs
djluv6p,"You're supposed to think that Baby is his actual name at first; the movie starts as this fun crime caper, before he and the audience starts to see that, no, this stuff actually does have a cost, his foster dad isn't just being a stick in the mud, this is a bad life. The end of the movie, we realize that he's been in this life so long, he's been called Baby so much, that he refers to himself as it, when really he's been Miles all along. He's just this kid who's been stuck doing crimes for his entire life, and that's HORRIBLE. It also adds a layer to him calling T-Rex ""Trex""; because music is such a fundamental part of his life, and yet Deborah is the first person in his entire life that he's been able to talk about it with out loud, and he's a little broken inside because of it, but he doesn't even know that he is.",6jxijs
djlwx6y,"> all of a sudden, the last 2 min of the movie, there's a ""oh by the way his name is Miles, the end.""

It's like he's changed and moved on from the part of his life when he was known as Baby. 

Both Baby and Debora go by fake monikers when they meet but eventually drop them for their real names. Debora has a fake name tag when they first meet that she continues to wear until the late stages of the movie. Baby goes by *Baby* until the court case. I think it's symbolic of ending old chapters and subsequently starting new chapters in their lives.",6jxijs
djlwxkk,"He probably enjoyed using sign language since it wasn't comfortable for him to talk to people and he didn't like it. So it's not that big a deal that his foster father was deaf.

Baby Driver is highly stylized a certain way, and you're going to have people that love it for the way that it is and people that hate it for the way that it is.  There are people that hate Scott Pilgrim for all the same reasons that other people love Scott Pilgrim.

When you factor in that Edgar Wright has a pretty damn good filmography, it's not hard to believe someone would prefer his other films to Baby Driver (though OP probably hasn't seen Fistful of Fingers).

I loved the movie and it's one of my favorite EW films, but I can see how someone would dislike it more than the others and I can't objectively say it's better that EW's other films.

The whole point of that scene was to show that Baby wanted to keep Deborah safe so they could potentially see each other again.

Jails aren't just the dirty places you see in TV dude, and orange jumpsuits are also not the only prison uniform. 25 years wasn't lenient at all, that's a quarter of his life for someone who was only a getaway driver who the judge knows was acting out of necessity.

djjraj1,"Doc helped him because he empathized with him in that moment, seeing Baby in love like Doc said he once was probably woke up a little humanity in him.

Jamie Foxx's character was supposed to be an unlikable douchebag, you were supposed to rejoice when he was killed because he added a layer of meddling unpredictability(the diner scene and the arms scene)

Baby got fed up with the killing that Jamie Foxx's character was committing. Baby is shown in the movie to be trying to prevent as much death as possible. Baby snapped because Jamie Foxx killed someone and would most likely kill again (Baby is shown to detest murder), and after that is just him trying to run away and most likely regretting the decision because it complicated the situation.

I agree a ""music video"" movie can be on the easy side to make, but don't you think the Wright deserve some credit for combining that idea/genre with a well-above-average car chase film? I liked the use of music in this more than, say, La La Land (and this movie certainly had better ""dance"" numbers than that over-hyped mess), and I haven't seen an action movie in years that bothered having half the lucidity or flow of this film. 

As for the music choices, you really think [Jonathan Richman/The Modern Lovers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZyMPToh9Yg) and an obscure [8-minute long Beck song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL_9zWmDcjs) on the second half of a 1998 album are Billboard Top 100? There's some great music on here, and if some of it is low hanging fruit, so be it.

I disagree entirely about Hamm becoming the villain. There were some strong callbacks to these former allies (sharing the earbuds in the diner, for example), and Hamm's character even tries to persuade Baby from leaving before the final heist, rather than simply trying to bully/force him into staying. There was an actual connection and betrayal between the two characters this way, and real motivation for Hamm's character to want not just revenge, but to rob Baby of what he loved most. Had Bernthal's character returned, the combo of him and the Fox character would have made it hard to believe Baby would live long.

The ending was sloppy ... kind of reminded me of the ""failure to land"" final 10 mins of The World's End. But I enjoyed this film, and of all the ways you say this film ""cashed in,"" I feel like Wright avoided a lot of obvious and easy beats for a fulfilling movie.",6jxijs

Cutting in and out of the car during the driving to fit beats rather than the moment made the flow of action jerky and confusing- might have been fine in a fight scene but not in driving.  This particular form of action is badly suited to Wrights pacing.  I honestly didn't feel like I was watching a chase movie, and there was no car worship either which might have saved it another way.  The most exciting and well shot chase scene was the one he was on foot- that I really enjoyed, that was exciting.  The rest were all Meh, making this the first Edgar Weight movie that I don't like.

Honestly I see the idea here but I think this film is a mess. Wrights highly stylised characters haven't been toned down quite enough to carry the drama, Spaceys character was never warm or invested enough for his heel-face-turn to be anything other than a record-scratching ""HUH?!"" Deborah was light and charming but their relationship never had even one deep moment that Baby didn't pull away from so I never felt I understood why he was anything but bad for her. 

This movie.... like wrights other films it has a good gimmick.  But unlike Scott pilgrim or The Worlds End the emotional core doesn't work well, and this is supposed to be a serious film so that problem is much starker.

Like it was worth a watch but I'm not putting it in the Wright section of my DVD case.

I would have liked some differences between his dream and the reality, such as different car, looks etc, even though the outcome of ""driving off into the sunset"" would be the same. In fact the end is like a fairy-tale with the white colours, the sun and the rainbow, they could have even done a reverse dream v reality where his dream is matched by what he expects, so cloudy weather, cheap car etc but overall he's happy, and by paying for his crimes and being able to start afresh, his reality ended up far better.",6jxijs
djpxhti,"Five years is still a long time.

Overall, I think that the ending was pretty great because it felt ""earned."" Baby undeniably did some morally incorrect things despite being a moral person. It would have felt strange for him to make his perfect getaway with everything considering that he got all the people around him killed. But he ends up paying a price. He gets jail time. And also, we know that the price he is supposed to pay is much greater. 25 years over his head and the audience feels the weight of the situation press down on us. And then the judge follows up with parole in 5 years and it comes as a huge relief, but still recognizing how long that is.

And at the end, he finally walks out, and it feels like it's all over, concluded, and that he has earned his right to be happy with Debora.",6jxijs

That's something that is fairly standard form when timing things with music. So you'll see it often in montages and music videos, but not often throughout an entire movie. And actions within the movie line up with music. Fresh off my head is the shots Buddy fires at the cops after they kill Darling. 

The first design choice that stood out to me and was clever was when Baby had one of his earbuds out. Music keeps playing, but only in one channel. And that matches the channel that Baby has in his ear. So he has only his right ear bud in, and we hear music from the right side of the auditorium. Even though the ear bud is on the audience's left. We are listening to the same thing Baby is. Really added a cool layer to the movie and I was super giddy.",6jxijs

If you're on a job and somebody gets cold feet and lets their emotions take over and gets somebody killed, then now you've let your own selfishness fuck up somebody else's life.

On the one hand, Bats was a piece of shit and he definitely deserved it, but he nearly got the entire fucking crew killed (I mean, ultimately he did) just because he lost his cool in that moment. We even know that Buddy was probably going to kill Bats anyway after that job because of what Darling said to him in the car at the gas station.",6jxijs

Let's be real, there are two people at fault here and it isn't Baby.

1. Bats, because he's a homicidal motherfucker who kills people just to kill them and literally everything he did put the crew in danger. If Baby didn't kill him then, he probably would have done some other shit.

2. It's Darling's fault for *standing in the open with no cover wielding two guns* and not expecting to get shot. The way those two shoot at people makes it look like they think they're bulletproof.

The latter felt like a classic Wright pacing gag that reminded me of [this scene in Scott Pilgrim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU1tDLu0foQ), except with the plot. Instead of trying wasting 5 minutes of your time showing a flashback to when Spacey's character was deeply in love to the point where it would change his heart completely, Wright said, ""you weren't going to buy it anyways so let's cut to the chase"". Its supposed to be ridiculous and remind you that none of the things that have happened thus-far, would ever happen in reality.


I feel like a lot of people will miss the gag and consider it lazy, but it felt like a really meta punchline.

doxpng1,"There's been speculation that Baby was just fantasizing about the final scene, and that he wasn't actually released. It makes sense considering the previous ""oldie"" visions were also fantasies... This one was in color, but I kept getting surreal vibes.


Edgar Wright said that the final scene where Baby gets out of jail was deliberately left ambiguous (notice that neither Baby nor Debora remains visibly aged) as to leave to the audience interpretation of whether he really got paroled, and as what the teller said about the rainbow turns out correct... OR it is merely a figment of his imagination.


It also had both actors Ansel Elgort and Lily James divisive about it. Elgort thought that it was indeed his imagination, while James thought that it indeed happened.",6jxijs
dopx6qo,He probbably got out on good behavior and all of the character witnesses?,6jxijs
doqzcwb,25 years is short?,6jxijs
djhxazd,The way I look at it is that they hinted at Doc's better side the entire movie. Instead of just killing the kid who stole from him he employed him. He always defended Baby and respected him. And he tops it off by saying he was in love once. Makes enough sense for me to be satisfied.,6jxijs
djhxi0g,"Well, I kind of get what they were going for. He relates to them because of his past, somehow.

The issue is that he also casually threatened them at the beginning during the wine scene, without batting an eye too, so yeah the change was a bit jarring.

I do appreciate that he didn't end up being a super cliche crime boss though, having some strange moments of softness like with his nephew and the ending served to further paint him as a slightly different type of crime boss you usually see in these films.

But I do agree it could have probably been executed a bit better. He might have needed like an extra scene, or different types of dialogue in order foreshadow that type of change.

",6jxijs
djhw2et,Yeah that 180 of his kinda threw me.  Didn't annoy me though.,6jxijs
djhxkrk,"He did say, ""I was in love once...""

Perhaps he sympathized with their desire to get away together. ",6jxijs
djjjv3a,He didn't plan on sacrificing his life for them. He just gave him his one tape and said get out of here and good thing he likes driving because he's going to be driving for 25 years. The plan was to get across the border but when the elevator opened and the dirty cops where there Doc knew they were there for him too. They thought Doc set them up so Doc shoots to protect himself as much as Baby. He gets shot and then shot again so he knew he wasn't going to make it and he probably thought he could kill/stop Buddy. I think it was more him trying to save himself than anything. ,6jxijs
djhvdtb,"I thought John Hamm became a little cartoonish, which was my major problem.",6jxijs
djhydeu,The movie never established his character beyond anything other than a professional cold blooded killer bent on making money. If they had developed his character some more beforehand then maybe I could understand why he suddenly sympathized with Baby toward the end. It was way too abrupt as you said.,6jxijs
djnr5z7,"Yeah, the way I pictured it ending is Baby getting his tapes back, and then realizing throughout all his songs he's put together that he actually accidentally has evidence besides just his word.  Then he would take Spacey down and ride off into the sunset after a slap on the wrist. 
 
Although that sounds a lot dumber after I typed it out haha.",6jxijs
dk0juii,"He didn't really sacrifice his life for Baby. He forgave Baby, which was in character. But then his life was threatened for his own fuckups and he paid the price. There could be a little bit of an honor thing - the fuckup that led to his death was all his own making by putting that crew together. So he could have felt it was his mess to clean up, not Baby's. That approach doesn't make sense if Spacey is the stereotypical cowardly mastermind who throws kids in front of buses to escape, but there's no real indication that he's that particular stereotype.",6jxijs
djnr6rx,"Fuck yes! I loved the film, just wished that Spacey's unjustified 180 turn hadn't felt so forced ",6jxijs
djq3x67,"I agree. That was the part of the ending I liked the least, other than Cyborg John Hamm",6jxijs
djl5gv3,"Yeah, I was hoping for one last chase out of the city with tons of people after them, but now that I'm thinking about it that would be hard to wrap up into a nice conclusion for the film. I'm fairly happy with the ending as is, but I wouldn't have minded a little more.",6jxijs
djkzbw1,I'd consider the foot chase - showdown with Hamm the final action sequence of the film. ,6jxijs
djph4ws,You're absolutely right. Joe is one of my favorite characters from the movie. The scenes featuring Baby and Joe were so sweet.,6jxijs
djorvq0,One of the reasons why Baby Driver is getting so much love is because its a breath of fresh air and for not being a prequel/sequel/comic book movie or a CGI extravaganza. It is a perfect antidote for the audience who are tired or sick of the Fast & Furious franchise. That's why people should definitely give Baby Driver a watch.,6jxijs

dk4jecj,And here I thought I was crazy because my friends didn't notice it!,6jxijs
dkgud0p,"I didn't say it was perfect. That part didnt really make sense to me either. But on the other hand, he shoots the three guys and turns to tell Baby to run because he thinks they're dead. Then one if them shoots him in the back. So Kevin Spacey didn't want to take a bullet, things got messy and that's just how it went down.

Buddy turns up and is driving straight at Spacey's character, who is not the kind of guy who you want to mess with, so he tries to kill Buddy and gets hit by the car. No problem with that either.

In theory it makes total sense but the way Wright went about the execution is definitely a little bit iffy.",6jxijs
dkgrafl,"Why the hell did Spacey's character do that? This guy didn't give a fuck about Baby, threatened him after finally setting him free, and Baby messed up his last heist. Why didn't he murder him on the spot? Or send his thugs after him? ",6jxijs

This is similar to Baby (initially) being a care-free innocent in the midst of heavy crime.",6jxijs
djqxadp,Also one that didn't hit me until the day after I saw it was when they were talking Debra/Deborah songs and referred to T. Rex as Trex.

djmuuqr,probably drugs,6jxijs
djmohzt,"He didn't call off the heist because he would have been stuck as they waited for another opportunity and the team (especially Bats) would've been even more suspicious of him. Baby was hoping to throw them off by agreeing and then slipping away.

Bats would've killed more people (and most likely him,) so he took him out when he had the chance. It seems like he debated for a bit before deciding he had to do it. 

As for Darling, it's understandable that Buddy blames Baby for her death, but it's not like she had to shoot at a bunch of cops while not taking any cover. 

",6jxijs
djn8lc8,"As for killing Bats, I don't think it was really planned. Yeah he was observing the truck but I think it was seeing the clerk from the Post Office that set him off.

djlrrt8,"I'm guessing Baby is supposed to be around 25ish in the film and has been boosting cars since he was 15 or younger and it was really young that Doc found him.

This was basically a toned down and drama-first-comedy-second version of a Hot Fuzz, which by the way he co-wrote (he's written every one of his well known and hallmark films, not sure what you mean by going back to things other people wrote). I mean, one of the opening scenes is him dancing in sequence to synchronized graffiti. I don't know how, knowing his previous work, you didn't expect this to be a fun, over the top movie.

dji01w7,"I was pretty disappointed with characters, I was hoping they'd be richer. Jamie Foxx imo, gave the best performance. Spacey was pretty conventional, Hamm & Gonzalez were the weakest easily, I wasn't compelled by them. The music sometimes was good but, at other points it was distracting or awkward. Plot was pretty safe. I don't think it was bad, but I don't think it was great. Just good enough. ",6jxijs

djz2e79,">But when he took that earbud from Baby, it was a great callback to earlier in the film when Darling was alive and he and Baby bonded a bit, and a moment for his character to have to make a final choice. 

I couldn't disagree more. I thought that was going to happen and rolled my eyes so hard, only to be pleasantly surprised. I was already in recovery from the eye roll from Spacey's sacrifice.

That whole ending was forshadowed the last time they were at the diner, where his wife said what would happen if he saw red. To have him then suddenly grow a conscience because the guy who got his wife killed also has someone he loves wouldn't put his recently dead wife suddenly out of his head to save true love or some crap.

I didn't mean all that to come out so harsh. I just feel like that would have cheapened what his wife thought of him and deprived the story of consequence. You can't go against a job, have someone's wife die in the process and not feel the consequences of it.",6jxijs
djyby6e,"I think the awkwardness of the final showdown came from starting with a set piece and working backwards. It's a car chase movie and Wright wanted to play with the genre in his characteristic way so we had a mash up of a car chase and a parking-garage-one-on-one-finale. The tight quarters made for some fun stunts and interesting driving but didn't really work in the broader scheme.

I think Spacey's change of heart was another working backwards problem. It was the third act villain twist turned on its head. We go through knowing that the heist colleague is a baddie but at the last minute he turns on (for?) the hero.

Incredibly fun movie, but I'd only put it at maybe Wright's fourth best - which is way higher than most things out this decade.",6jxijs
djya58g,"The car chase point you make is another thing that bugged me I think, the best car chase in the movie was the opening and the finale consisted of Baby running around doing parkour and then the weird car-terminator standoff. None of it felt natural, or where the story should have went.",6jxijs
djxuczu,"Agree with you. Loved the music and the editing, but the last 15 minutes were absolutely unnecessary. Hamm becomes a terminator? Spacey goes from breaking legs to ""I'll die for you""?

The acting was spotty as well. Hamm looked like he was reprising Don Draper when his white collar crime past came up. Foxx's character had no motivation to be as big of a dick as he was

The mom angle seemed forced in, especially since it mist have been some 15 years since the accident",6jxijs
djxdzrn,"Definitely, agreed on all points. It's a shame because the movie is *almost* there but it does enough wrong to keep it out of ""classic"" territory.",6jxijs

djs3y41,"Yeah, I completely agree. Still figuring out everything I think about the ""i was in love once"" comment. I think it might be one of the most nuanced-yet-deep parts of the movie.

Most crucially; the heists themselves. [It's shown that Doc and the others have to find supplies, weapons, as well as fences for the stolen goods. Before the ""Halloween"" heist, Doc mentions that whoever buys the masks needs to 'take their time over a few days, and don't buy them all at once' to avoid suspicion.

For Drive, That A Real Hero moment, ugh I know what you mean by that. Bit of a cringe. However, the Nightcall - Kavinsky drive scene felt so satisfying after the opening chase and I was really hoping for a scene that had that kind of impact but Wright's direction sort of meant that there wouldn't be room for any hint of pretentiousness but more of a charm and wit to how the story was told.

And as for GotG, definitely they were unapologetically camp with the songs and Chris Pratt was just himself on camera essentially.

It was obvious the writers just wanted to get him out of jail as fast as possible. 

At the start there is a tough guy who has a confrontation in the warehouse with Baby about his headphones. This is repeated almost word for word when Jamie Foxx's character replaces him. Why repeat this scene twice? I felt like Doc's 'never repeat the same crew twice' rule was there to recycle thinly written and interchangeable characters over and over. 

For a film about music I didn't think it was that memorable either. I expected to come out of the cinema humming a theme song, and wanting to download the soundtrack, but instead I can't remember any of it. I think there was the same Queen song twice?

djrr8k1,"> It's not a film you can really pick apart for believability

With a well-made film you're so immersed that you don't have time to pick it apart for ""believability"". But this film was technically competent, fun to look at, but with zero nutritional value. It lacked character's that you (or I, at least) cared about, which was distracting. Then, once I was distracted, I had no choice but to question it.

Kevin Spacey makes a huge deal about ""never working with the same team twice"" and then in the third job we see he's pulled together the same team. I figured he was setting them up to ""dispose of the evidence"" from his previous jobs before he closed up shop. But no. He just decided to break his rules this one time and pull together the most unstable elements from the last two jobs.

What was the point of them spending the night at the HQ? Because they had an early start? What time does that post office open? Can't these criminals be trusted to be somewhere on time? There was no real reason, it was just lazy writing.

Doc calls off the last job because they just killed a bunch of cops and there's too much heat but sure, if you guys want to do it why not? Why even have that scene? What's the point? No real reason. Just lazy writing.

djrtb44,"> He has JD killed as an example. Bats killing the cops basically burned their operation.

All the more reason to have Bats taken out, IMHO: J.D. was killed for being careless, while Bats willfully disobeyed Doc's orders. So killing Bats would set an example to never disobey Doc's orders.

> He could kill him but it wouldn't make much of a difference since if he did he couldn't go through with the op. 

I don't think so: when Baby was found with the tapes, Doc's first instinct was to take him off the job and go call for a new driver, despite Baby being his irreplaceable, lucky charm wheelman. So, he has time to replace the irreplaceable, but doesn't have the time to replace the grunt with the gun? Unless I missed him dying, Flea's character is still around.

> And also Buddy wound up back Bats' story, so Doc didn't really have a choice.

So does Baby, and the thing that's constantly hammered to the audience is that he's a bad liar. Doc is generally a pretty smart guy, he should have seen right through the lie if Bats and Buddy could earlier in the movie.

> Doc probably realizes he's fucked at the end one way or another so he decides to do the noble thing.

This would have been more believable had there been a few scenes anywhere prior where Doc had behaved nobly. What instead is shown, is a cold, shrewd, cutthroat chessmaster. And he threatens Baby with harm to Debora earlier in the movie, so why does he suddenly care about them after Baby has fucked him over in the biggest way possible?

> I don't really get this complaint. He shouldn't be mad that his wife died because it was sort of her fault? 

Yeah, that's fair, though my issue with Buddy is less with his wife and more with the way they introduced his psychopathy to begin with. Had there been a single scene where Buddy behaves in a truly unhinged manner before Darling dies, I could have bought it. Instead we get 90% of the movie where Buddy seems like a genuinely reasonable, decent dude (insofar as a bank robber can be) and one truly awful scene where Darling just tells Bats and Baby that he's a hard man while Buddy glares menacingly. That's tell don't show at it's worst, and it's bad writing.

Don't get me wrong, I think it's a competent movie; I may even like it. It just has pretty glaring flaws that are sometimes hard to overlook, even as a fairy tale.

1) Kevin Spacey makes a huge deal about ""never working with the same team twice"" and then in the third job we see he's pulled together the same team from the LAST TWO jobs. I figured he was setting them up to ""clean up loose ends"" from his previous jobs before he closed up shop. But no. He just decided to break his rules this one time and pull together the most unstable elements from the last two jobs - how much heat did Jamie Foxx bring with all of his killing? Why not bring back the original team from job one? Why not just have the first team and make the ""if you don't see me again it's because I'm dead"" guy the unstable element? I'm guessing that's how it was written but they wanted to jam in as many ""name"" actors as possible so they wrote in the ""I never work with the same team twice"" to explain it. Lazy writing, IMO.



2) What was the point of them spending the night at the HQ? Because they had an early start? What time does that post office open? Can't these criminals be trusted to be somewhere on time?

Baby has an extreme aversion to violence due to his childhood trauma. He's absolutely fine with robberies and he knows people will get hurt but he manages to drown that out by focusing on the music. However, he cannot escape or excuse Bats behavior. It causes him to snap when, essentially, he caused the security guard's death by alerting the teller in the first place. He was not thinking rationally or about the future.


Darling may not be the experienced robber she tries to present herself as. If Bats was correct, she's just a stripper with a drug problem. Even so, being good at robbing things does not mean you're useful in a gunfight. She's used to mostly unarmed victims.


And Doc already has made up his mind about Baby. As tough as he acted, it was (mostly) an act. He always felt protective of Baby, was always going to take care of him.

The final showdown should have occurred at the diner with Spacey waiting for him and Hamm showing up. All the shit goes down there--make Baby become the hero when he's out of his element. By baby being in a car for most of the battle, you know he's going to win. Only for that last fraction of the battle do you even question it. How it plays now, it lowers the stakes for too long.",6jxijs
djud2ix,"No no, I get it. I just feel like a lot of people don't appreciate the story he's telling in Baby Driver like they should. It's simple, but it's beautiful. Just like his other films. ",6jxijs

djjxwp0,"Sure, he was fond of Baby, that much is clear, but he threw away his life for almost no reason. He threatened to disfigure Baby's girlfriend, but somehow she's still the catalyst to making him die for Baby. It felt way too forced and the movie was worse for it.",6jxijs
djiu8l7,"Yeah, and it's something that could be fixed with a single line earlier in the movie. Like, when he's threatening that if baby doesn't do the job, he'll have someone beat the shit out of her, mention how he's been put in a similar situation. 

Hell, they could have changed the kid in the movie from his nephew to his son, and it would have shown how at some point he had a romantic relationship. 

In any other movie, I would be fine with this twist, but I think that Edgar wright knows better than to have a payoff without a setup.",6jxijs

djyj47f,"I feel like one of the cars honked when Baby cut them off though. Also, that'd be insane timing to match the cars up right as Baby is merging onto the highway. That means they accounted for all the crazy routes Baby took on his way to the highway...which is...interesting",6jxijs

djt8g1h,"I can kinda see where it happens with Hamm's character; I just still thought it seemed a little sudden and strange. 

I *don't* see it at. all. with Spacey's character, though. One scene he's like ""You know I could break your legs..."" and ""Your waitress girlfriend is cute...let's keep it that way"" to ""Well, I was in love once....OK, take your tape!"" Just seemed kind of cheesy to me. As if Edgar Wright was like, ""The main characters are going to need help at this point. How do we do it? Ehhh, I guess Doc just says fuck it and risks his life for Baby now."" 

*Literally* my only complaint for this movie, though. ",6jxijs

I haven't seen a ton of movies from the 60s-70s but it felt like it had that ""paying homage"" to them kind of vibe that Shaun of the Dead had but I couldn't pinpoint any of them. I guess I got that vibe because the name Baby Driver just feels super old school. ",6jxijs

Which Police Story? The original was a classic Jackie Chan movie filled with lots of fun. New Police Story was an update with some of the fun still there and introduction of drama as Jackie didn't want to be just a comedic action star. Then there's the most recent Police Story which was all drama. Having seen most of Jackie's movies growing up, him in a full dramatic role with action stunts minimized distracted me too much for me to enjoy it at the time I watched it. The other movies I watched multiple times, but that one was just too different. ",6jxijs

There's a certain enjoyment in discovering jokes layered on top of each other that you didn't notice before.

Baby Driver may have had all the subtlety of a movie like Hot Fuzz, but it didn't use that subtlety to make the movie more enjoyable to watch. That's the main problem with it.

djo2pu1,"As someone who has been in literally the exact same jail as shown in the film let me tell you that sentence is BS. First off because he would have been guaranteed to get either the death penalty or natural life. Also, even if he only got 25 years the first parole hearing is after 65% of time served for a violent crime. Only non-violent drug offenses have bail hearings at 20% of time served.",6jxijs
djnymbi,"Sure, but let's just look at his most recent crime and consider the 19 counts he's facing. As I said in another comment, getaway drivers are on the hook for the same crimes as the armed robbers, even if they don't ever pull a trigger. Get murdered cops involved, and you're looking at way more than 5 years, I don't care how good his ""character"" is. We're not talking about one or two murders here, we're talking about at least a dozen murders and multiple manslaughter charges along with a ton of property damage and theft. 

I know it's a whimsical, fun movie and not a realistic one, but it's pretty sobering to think about how many very young men (including people who committed crimes as minors) are serving a lot more time for lesser things (driving the car away after holding up a convenience store, for example). It's a fairy tale sentence, which I guess is suitable for a sort of urban crime fairy tale, but the ending still felt really off to me. ",6jxijs
djntrrw,"Well, I would argue that more scenes than just that were supposed to convey the whimsy of the film, but then why include the prison sentence at all? It was a really off choice to me.

djnsr9k,"Agreed. I can't think of a better way to use Blur's
Intermission. One thing that's bothering me, though--there was an instrumental that was playing during a scene between Baby and Deborah that I recognized but I do not see it on the soundtrack listing. It's going to bug me now.

EDIT: I figured it out. It's New Orleans Instrumental No. 1 by REM. I used to listen to that album a lot in high school, it's solid.  ",6jxijs
djnsbwi,"Right, but 5 years is way too little. Getaway drivers are on the hook for the same crimes as the armed robbers, even if they don't ever pull a trigger. Get murdered cops involved, and you're looking at way, WAY more than 5 years, I don't care how good his ""character"" is. 

Personally, I did not find his character appealing. Obviously he was a great driver. I loved all the scenes in which he was driving, and the running and walking. The talking? Not so much. ",6jxijs
djkfc6d,"I disagree - I think the problem is with how the story (or lack thereof for a good chunk of the script) is told, especially through how character development and motivation push it along. I actually wonder if there's was some studio interference, even if small. 

Interestingly, the main antagonists (Doc and Buddy) have the most fleshed out characters. Buddy's interest in Baby and his silence when Bats suspects he was a Wall Street swindler looking for frivolous entertainment mean so much more when juxtaposed with his determination to punish Baby for his culpability in Darling's death than, say, Baby offering to make his foster dad a PBJ (this seems like a shoehorned vessel for another 'he loves music!' Baby moment). Doc's involvement of his nephew - especially knowing Monsters, Inc. Lines - and his reversal at the end show a fleshed out character. Baby starts and ends in the same spot - as a really good, selfless guy who loves music and driving, and doesn't want to commit crimes.

This all seems not very Edgar Wright-y to me. Still, I want to like it so badly, and I will keep trying.

And, agreed - I would pay to watch an Edgar Wright movie that I don't care for over the average Hollywood movie any day of the week. ",6jxijs

So it was just a ""too good to be true, love at first sight"" deal. But yeah, almost dying from meeting some dude two days before would probably make me question being with him.

They definitely rushed that part. They could've easily added 20 minutes worth of scenes between them to give a reason why this would happen - but then again, it's got the feel of a cheesy action film, so I didn't really expect everything to make perfect sense, and I don't think any viewer should. With that said, if that's not your type of movie, then you can have any opinion on it. ",6jxijs
djlr4wu,"> however it was completely unrealistic that she would even consider running away with him and potentially ruining her life after only meeting him a couple of days prior.

I have a lot of movies then you would find completely unrealistic then.",6jxijs

My sis turned to me at one point and legit asked, ""is this a musical??""

The movie felt very try-hard, which makes it uncool. It's something that is very common in Tarantino movies as well, where the actors have some ""ultra-deep way over your head"" convo that is very isn't deep at all - and that makes it pretentious.

This is just my opinion of course and I'm not a professional reviewer at all. To each their own. In my opinion, a movie which is very cool with very cool characters is Snatch. It doesn't try to be cool, it just is.",6jxijs

I don't think it was a matter of liking Baby enough to not kill her, but just a realization that they don't need any more heat right before a heist so it wasn't worth killing somebody for no reason.

It was Bats making the realization that it wouldn't be a good idea to kill Baby's girl. First, it would be a bad idea to fuck with their driver right before a big heist and second, if he killed Baby I doubt he would want to explain to Doc why his good luck charm was dead.",6jxijs
djqv1rd,"I think the deafness was a key part of the ending.

His tinnitus is symbolic of the damage left from the car accident, physical and mental.  He misses his mother, and the tinnitus represents that.  He literally drowns out his emotions with music and danger.  The one time he isn't listening to music and doesn't hear tinnitus is on his date with Debora; she's the only thing other than the music that fills the void left by his mother.

In the end when he's deafened notice that he's not sad about it.  He can hear a little but the one thing he definitely can't hear is his mother's voice, but he has Debora, and no tinnitus.  Like the danger, the music is gone from his world, but he no longer needs to drown anything out with it, because he's at peace.

And I think actually Edgar Wright addressed the guy with the guns in an AMA; to quote the man himself, ""he's carrying two guns because he's a fucking American citizen"".",6jxijs

I think I got that implication that [they would be unlikely friends is how they are sitting in the diner. They're on the same side and Buddy and Darling are on the other.

I'd even say that the Wallstreet name calling is a way to solidify Buddy as the bull on account of that big old bull statue right outside of the NYSE.

2. Baby, after spending years being a getaway driver, just all of a sudden decides to act on emotion?

3. That foreshadowing speech /= character development. Buddy was ""just another good"" until he became the main bad guy. Bats had so much more development and interaction with Baby.

djqzdbb,"Only some of them worked for Doc, not the entire ATL police department...",6jxijs
djt2855,That's not how Rotten Tomatoes works. It is the score that it is,6jxijs
djzi0x8,"> Buddy initially is portrayed as a ""good"" guy but does a 180

I disagree. Go back to the scene where the heist team go to the diner. In that scene Darling tells Bats about Buddy's ""bad side"", about him ""seeing red"" when provoked. It's a great scene. Darling's delivery makes you believe she's just trying to intimidate Bats but failing at it, but later you find out that she's telling the truth and that Buddy indeed goes absolutely insane when provoked. There is no 180 to see here, it all happens as Darling says.

>and its not even like a plot twist

I disagree. Buddy is, as you put it, initially portrayed as a ""good"" guy. Then he goes on a murderous rampage. That's a twist.

>it just sorta happens for no reason 

I disagree. Darling and Buddy spend half their screen time making out. They clearly care a lot about each other. And then Baby gets Darling killed. That's enough reason for someone like Buddy to get medieval on his ass.

> His death is so unsatisfying, like there was no buildup to it

Again, I disagree. Bats was an absolute dick to Baby the whole time. He did everything he can to get under his skin, and Baby was very clearly affected by him. Then the camera showed Baby looking at the bundle of steel rods several times, which *clearly* suggested he was about to do something with them. You should have seen his death coming before he even sat in that car for the last time.

>Monica is sort of a neutral character but she dies. What did this have to do with anything...it just left me confused and irritated

I disagree with this as well. She's the part of an armed heist crew, and she clearly likes shooting at people. They get in a firefight with the police, and after killing a whole bunch of them, she gets shot. Police usually shoots armed robbers who try to kill them, it's expected. Her death isn't completely pointless either. It's the main reason why Buddy, the former ""good guy"", becomes a villain. Darling's death is a critical plot point.",6jxijs
djzeeul,"I disagree with pretty much everything you said. I enjoyed that Buddy pulled the 180. It kept the audience guessing as to who the villain was going to be. Do you prefer the villain to be clear from the beginning? 

As for Monica's death... That's what caused Buddy to turn. I don't get why you complain about his transition and her death meaning nothing in the same comment. 

And there was a build up to Bat's death... Did you see the stare down with his gun drawn? Or the several times he got under Baby's skin?

djo3e11,"I'm not blind to the reality of what the movie was setting up.  The action scenes _did_ dwindle in length, inventiveness and excitement as the movie progressed, and the inherent diminishment of the fun factor did not have to ding all three of those.  There is no reason why the grand finale could not have been a more intricate and lengthier chase than the opening act, with the added bonus of an emotional angle.  Instead we got about 20 seconds of extremely disorienting fast-cuts of a chase in reverse.  Not going to try to second-guess the director; just saying _I_ personally felt like this was a giant missed opportunity and a pretty huge letdown.

Everyone I've spoken with agreed that the movie was disappointing, so I'm happy I at least know why it disappointed me.  The frustrating thing is that RottenTomatoes was a pretty big failure for me this time around.  I may have to start picking and choosing reviewers at this rate.",6jxijs

djizi96,"You could argue that all of Edgar Wright's movies play around with the idea of tropes. The ""I was in love once..."" trope is pretty common in these type of films.

For better or worse Baby Driver calls out the tropes but plays them more straight.",6jxijs
djl1kw2,"But did she know it was reluctantly? We, the audience, knew but she didn't have any clear indication. To Deb, the Coke scene didn't read like Baby was under duress, more like shame or embarrassment of his cohorts. The audience could infer he was forced into it because we had more information than Lilly James' character. 

I dunno - it's probably just me other-thinking it but I can't make that leap the movie is asking me to. I think about this flick if it were written from her point of view and Baby would have come off as dangerous and bad news in the few interactions they had. He has a vague and mysterious backstory, a troubled youth and his friends were sleazy as hell. ",6jxijs
djl49rk,"But why? She had no motivation to cross the line into criminal acts to escape. If her character had revealed a life of abuse she was trapped in or something I'd buy it but I don't know enough about her to understand her motivations.

Edgar wright is like Quentin Tarantino: none of his films mean anything, they're just movies made for movie nerds that some other people happen to like, and movie nerds like movies for a different reason than the rest of the population.

I read Kermode's review who suggested this was essentially a romantic musical which disguised itself as a car chase movie (I tend to agree - for a car chase movie it was actually pretty short on getaway driving) and with the former in mind I didn't think there was much of a reason to underwrite Debra/the mother and to some extent Darling.

The last scene at the desk with baby, deb, and spacey was also kinda dumb but it can be explained cause of buddy's line earlier of ""emotions will get you killed."" Baby was the closest thing he had to a friend and it got him killed.

Secondly, the manner in which the scene was acted was random and not funny and a big waste of time. That scene could have been cut. He stands there thinking, and then he walks away, randomly kicks something on the floor (someone please explain that) then tosses the phone. Just an awful scene. I was scratching my head wondering what the aim of that scene was.

I've noticed it in Wonder Woman too. These 2 hour+ movies have these completely useless scenes that have no business making it into the final edit. It's just lazy and boring. The entire theatre I was with was completely quiet and devoid of any energy.

> It also shows him slip into the hope that he's out of the game - though both he and the audience know that's not the case.

No, there was never any hope. After he takes his girl out, Frank Underwood tells him he has two choices, and instead of him saying ""No"" and having to be forced back in because he harms his girl or, y'know, ANYTHIGN INTERESTIGN, Kevin Spacey's character just looks at him and says ""I can either break your legs or you can come drive tonight.""

Then the kid goes, ""Ok. I'll be there."" Like why the hell did they even waste on time pondering the hope that he could make it out? The movie is getting worse the more I think about it.

What they should have done is have him say no, Kevin Spacey walk away, bring him back into the fold in an interesting way **which would have also fixed the botched romance!**

But no.",6jxijs
djl1li0,"> Doc helped him because he empathized with him in that moment, seeing Baby in love like Doc said he once was probably woke up a little humanity in him.

Doc and Baby have years-long relationship. Baby finally fulfills end of contract. Doc tells him in reality, there is no getting out. Baby says he still doesn't want to come back. Doc says he'll break his legs. Baby says, ""Ok. Fine."" Doc, STILL THE GUY THAT HAS SHOWED ZERO MERCY OR CARE ABOUT BABY, then continues on that path at the end of the movie in their last meeting.

So at this point, before the girlfriend walks in, what is their relationship? **Doc does not care one bit about Baby.** And then... magically... he is now willingly to, as he says ""Get out of here, I'll deal with the cops"" AFTER BEING SHOT, he's now suddenly willing to lay down his life for Baby?????

Does that make any sense to anyone?

> Jamie Foxx's character was supposed to be an unlikable douchebag

Of course that was the point. But evil characters don't have the excuse of being bad characters. There is nuance to people. Not with his character. Just 100% douchebag. Literally ZERO character development. The entire film, he doesn't change. He's one boring character the entire time.

do58ghh,"I agree that this shot would have benefited from being in 60fps, but I don't think changing the whole movie to that would be a good decision because it would lose that ""movie"" feel. Then again, only having 1 scene be 60fps might not work very well either.",6jxijs
djre62s,"Funny, Foxx is hands-down the worst part of the movie for me. He's a cartoon character and everyone else isn't. ",6jxijs
dji1s3n,"Baby's decision to kill Bats is what led to Darling being killed, which caused Hamm to ""see red"".

",6jxijs
dji93la,"I think there are a few reasons. Doc probably had someone in his past that he cared about and didn't want to take away from Baby what he had lost. He also was a sort of second father figure to Baby, bringing him onto his team at a very young age. He actually cared about the kid after all those years, and I think he was proud of Baby. He may have been bluffing when he was threatening Baby, just to try to get him to stay.",6jxijs
djia8qa,"He knew he was fucked pretty much no matter what he did - considering the Bananas crew would have been on him even if Baby was nowhere to be seen, and that's just the start, he'd be fighting for his life for the extended future - so he figured he might as well repay Baby's loyalty up to that point. Baby fucked the job, but Doc probably realized it was partially his own fault for shanghaiing Baby back into the game in the first place when he easily could have let him walk.",6jxijs
djnkwl3,"Wow. We watched the same movie very differently. 

The one difinitive thing you could say about Buddy and Darling's relationship was that they fucking LOVED each other. You don't kill dudes for looking at your lady unless you are either a madman or super in love (he was both). 

The tension they both exuded in the diner scene was incredible. John Hamm's forehead vein game was on point, makeup or not. He had obviously lost a lot and had fallen hard (whether or not he was actually a banker is irrelevant) and the only things he had left was his booger sugar and  his lady. 

When she went down....He just went fucking bananas. 

I thought it was handled well because Baby didnt give Bats the chance to be the Big Bad and Doc was acting very erratically. Buddy stepped up to be the final boss and I think it worked perfectly. Especially after painting him as the closest thing to a friend throughout the film. ",6jxijs

djlq3wu,"yeah and just the way he said ""that's enough""",6jxijs
djn4nki,Yeah.  They put a leather jacket and a dodgy haircut on don draper and hoped it would make him woody Harrelson.  I thought he was dreadfully miscast.,6jxijs

djo80n3,"It wasnt, but it absolutely should have been!",6jxijs
djhwrca,"I think he knew he was gonna be killed either way, so he might as well just help Baby out anyways.",6jxijs
djizj31,"I thought we got a lot of nice subtle foreshadowing for it.  
  
* He repeatedly defends Baby against his other crew members to the point of openly mocking them.  
* He gives Baby a cut of every job even thought he doesn't have to and wouldn't if he were an evil prick.  
* And he trusts Baby to the point that Baby is the lone exception to his 'no crew twice' rule -- Baby is on every job.  
  
Sure he's not a big softy, but he does show mercy a lot in the movie; he let's Foxx get away with murdering his guys. He's also logical and doesn't revel in hurting people.  
  
So once he's lost everything, it make sense he would help Baby specifically and not go down screaming about revenge. It adds some nice depth to what would otherwise be a pretty undynamic character.",6jxijs
djhxmsb,"It's not cliche. Cliche means overused and overly common. How many mob boss characters in these types of heist films can you point to where they did the same thing?

It did feel out of tune and there was no real foreshadowing for it, which is why it does feel a bit weak. But cliche is not the right term to just throw out there. The turn was genuinely surprising to say the least.",6jxijs
djiv1ie,"I remember when Baby reached the restaurant I was expecting Spacey to be sitting there, when it was Buddy I was surprised.

I kind of bought their connection. Even after the Monsters Inc line I felt Spacey legitimately felt a bond with ""that's my baby"", every line he gave after Baby failed them was fueled with disappointment rather than anger. ""Get this fool home, we'll find someone else to do the job""

This movie had Spacey directly responsible for killing or cleaning up the death of 2 of his henchmen, and to Baby's perceived betrayal his reaction is ""take this fool home"".

I believe whole heartedly that Doc would protect Miles. He may be the only person in the business Doc actually *cares* about.",6jxijs
djhwugs,To me it felt not cliche just based on all of the other roles I've seen Spacey play lol,6jxijs
djhygt1,"I took it as he knew he was fucked anyways, so he's like might as well try to pass the torch. ",6jxijs
djkjmzn,Cliche would have been having Spacey be the last villain standing.,6jxijs
djmwmc2,"I don't think he meant to sacrifice his life there like he thought it was actual cop at first and then really thought he could kill buddy. I also think a BIG theme of this movie is 'doing good things matter even if you're doing bad' like Baby saving that teller and giving the woman her purse back all positively effected his life in the end and they mattered even though he was doing bad things. And Kevin Spacy's character, while not surviving, was exposed to be deep down a man of reason and a man who actually gave a shit about Baby. I just thought that was a good thing, just didn't feel out of tune for me. ",6jxijs
djkhrx8,"I think there were some scenes removed that showed a deeper relationship with Doc and Baby. The line about Doc being in love once at the end, and the way that Doc needs Baby in on every job; kind of indicates that Doc has a paternal relationship to Baby that he doesn't know how to express. He gives him gifts, seems invested in improving his life, and at multiple points kind of tries to give him an out, albeit poorly.

Also: the huge amount of tiny cars he brings to meetings makes me think he might have lost a kid. Like he was planning on giving them to his son, but now uses them to plan his heists instead. 

It feels like there was a lot of dangling ends in the subtext of various scenes involving the two. I wish they'd focused on it more, and less on some other things. Doc being slightly jealous of Babies foster father, or trying to bond with Baby but just not having the skills or character traits to be able too would have been interesting to me.",6jxijs
djl8qna,"Yeah ""I was in love once"" come on",6jxijs
djn3d7j,"Yeah for me that was a record-screeching ""Huh?!?"" Moment, not the emotional sacrifice it needed to be.  That character delivering his lines like a criminal Middle manager rather than any kind of human was a stylistic choice that robbed that catharsis of any possible meaning.  Who was that guy?  Why did he do it?  We were never given the idea he was anything other than ""mildly fond"" of baby, never thought that he saw him as anything other than a useful bit disposable tool.   Just did not work for me, YMMV.",6jxijs
djjbmd1,What else could he do in that situation?,6jxijs
djjnvjh,WHAT IF... the thing that Baby took from Kevin Spacey but couldn't just give him back... Was that he ran over Kevin Spacey's SO while stealing his car?,6jxijs
djnmzma,"A little bit?  That part was ridiculous!  Makes no sense for him to go from evil dude ""I'm gonna control you forever"" to ""I'll die to save you.""  I loved the action and the music but the writing in this movie is pretty bad - feels like people are giving it a pass because of who made it and because the mechanisms that propel you through the bad writing are so good.",6jxijs
dk3r9vp,"Late to the discussion, but I really felt like Spacey honestly viewed himself as a father figure to Baby. When he's making him do all these heist jobs, it's because he thinks the money legitimately is what Baby needs in his life. He's twisted his morality to view himself as Baby's protector and guidance imo.",6jxijs
djl28oe,Honestly that left a bad taste in my mouth. Loved the movie but damn that didn't feel right at all. ,6jxijs

djji78q,"I thought it was just another dream scene, though. It transitions from him staring at the postcard to this idealized scene, and it goes from dream black and white into this overly bright, saturated color that wasn't seen before in the movie.

When Spacey asks who shot first, he pretty much knows Bats is lying so he asks Baby for confirmation and asks whether or not they continue the job. I think if Baby would have said ""Too risky. Another time?"" Spacey would have found that reasonable and was probably thinking the same thing. I also don't think Bats would have got to Baby, Doc and Buddy wouldn't have let that happen at the time.

However later on in the tape situation (when Buddy is caught) they'd all definitely have killed him if he didn't do his big ""I'm your driver"" speech.",6jxijs
djjo7hx,I don't think so because the circumstances had changed at that point.  Jamie Fox's character had killed a bunch of police officers and there was more heat on the job.  Spacey's character also made it a point to ask Baby for his opinion.  He didn't need to that.  ,6jxijs

djjsra3,"The parallelism with Baby and Buddy continues (and not only with b and y beginning and ending their names) Buddy's backstory is basically that he got in too deep and left with Darling as he had nothing left and she was the only thing to him. 

Baby's story is that he gets in too deep and plans to leave with Debbie ( Debbie and Darling ;)) because he has nothing there for him and she was the only thing really worth it to him. They even have the same sort of plan as Buddy, Baby and Debbie just want to run away (with Baby running away from his problems like Buddy) like Buddy and Darling did before as described by Bats. 

The true Arc with Baby is that instead of running from his problems and endangering the only thing he cared about like Buddy did (Buddy even comments on this ""You can't keep running Baby"") Baby decides to face the charges and keep Debbie in safety the complete opposite of Buddy. 

We even see hints of Darling coming out in Debbie when she almost decides to try and ram through the police barricade. 

Another thing seems to be the connections between Bats and Baby's father who seem to have hints of the same behavior with both being violent and abusive people in general and they both die in the exact same position while the exact same thing in their respective cars. 

Almost like a Christmas Carol, Buddy and Darling represent Baby's future if he continues to pile up crimes and mistakes, with Baby and Darling ending up as criminals on the run from both Doc and the cops(Buddy with his former financial associates and the cops) and Bats represents his past with the father parallels and possibly how Baby viewed his father (unpredictable, rude and abusive). 

Deborah is of course a parallel for his mother, they both called him Baby, they worked in the same place, and they are both endangered by Bats/Baby's father with Baby's father causing his mother's death(while Baby can't prevent his mother's death he stops Deborah's death in the hands of Bats) 


Bats (endangers Deborah, Baby stops him as an adult) = Baby's dad (endangers Baby's mom, Baby is helpless as a child) 

Deborah (almost dies as a result of Bats and Baby putting her in danger like Buddy does with Darling)= Baby's mom (dies as a result of Baby's dad)

Buddy = Baby's bad future if he leaves without finishing the job and accepting his part in the crimes and murders 

Darling = Debbie's bad future",6jxijs

Love interest had no reason to stay after the way he treated her (in terms of flaking and clearly not having a healthy lifestyle). Also I don't know if a dude tells you he loves her after one date, that's a HUGE red flag but she was like omg I love you too. Obviously for a movie you have to suspend belief but there were too many things like that in their relationship to overlook. 

Jon Hamm becoming the villain was kinda pointless. At that point when he did become the villain he was more of an annoying of forwarding the plot instead of ever feeling like he could actually cause trouble. 

The whole thing of him having to pay off the debt for over a decade because of the lost money in the trunk of the car. How big was that trunk! He would've paid that off a long time ago.

dk2azud,"Assuming it didn't burst eardrums, there could probably be permanent damage (if that range wasn't already damaged in childhood), however the majority of the gunshots would be temporary.   
Immediately, it would sound sort of like trying to hear with your ears covered by Pringles tubes while a REALLY LOUD ringing sound was going off in your ears/head.  
You'd still be able to hear, loud things at least, but the ringing would be painful and distracting.

djrvmrg,">All the more reason to have Bats taken out, IMHO: J.D. was killed for being careless, while Bats willfully disobeyed Doc's orders. So killing Bats would set an example to never disobey Doc's orders.

Who's going to kill Bats in this scenario? Baby couldn't do it, at least not premeditated, and Buddy (and therefore Darling) were on Bats' side. Is Doc going to do it himself? Also this was supposed to be the last hoorah type of mission, there's no example to set anymore.

>I don't think so: when Baby was found with the tapes, Doc's first instinct was to take him off the job and go call for a new driver, despite Baby being his irreplaceable, lucky charm wheelman. So, he has time to replace the irreplaceable, but doesn't have the time to replace the grunt with the gun? Unless I missed him dying, Flea's character is still around.

Fair enough.

>So does Baby, and the thing that's constantly hammered to the audience is that he's a bad liar. Doc is generally a pretty smart guy, he should have seen right through the lie if Bats and Buddy could earlier in the movie.

Why does it matter if he was lying or not in this instance?

>This would have been more believable had there been a few scenes anywhere prior where Doc had behaved nobly. 

He pays Baby a wage out of what Baby owes him, he gives him a gift, he talks a lot about how he cares about Baby and admires him to the point where he goes against protocol to keep him on the team. He's clearly a father figure to Baby, albeit a stern one. I definitely buy that he cares deeply about Baby. As cold and shrewd as he's otherwise portrayed, that affection is very much in line with his character IMO. Also threats don't have to be legitimate as long as the person you're making them to believes you.

>Yeah, that's fair, though my issue with Buddy is less with his wife and more with the way they introduced his psychopathy to begin with. Had there been a single scene where Buddy behaves in a truly unhinged manner before Darling dies, I could have bought it. Instead we get 90% of the movie where Buddy seems like a genuinely reasonable, decent dude (insofar as a bank robber can be) and one truly awful scene where Darling just tells Bats and Baby that he's a hard man while Buddy glares menacingly. That's tell don't show at it's worst, and it's bad writing.

There's a scene where Darling tells Buddy that after the heist she wants him to kill Bats for looking at him funny, and that he's done this before. This establishes that Buddy would do anything for Darling. So I think this is pretty well-established, so I don't know if it's much of a leap to get from Buddy being a dangerous (albeit charismatic and usually down to earth) criminal to Buddy being a vengeful one.

Love is something that makes people behave irrationally and out of character at a moment's notice, and I think that's a theme that's prevalent through the film. Buddy for Darling, Baby for Debora, Doc for Buddy.

djrs2ja,"1) Did he mean he never uses people a second time other than Baby, or that he never puts the same four people together a second time? I agree that this could have been clearer, but if you presume he meant the second thing then it's easier to swallow. Buddy and Darling are a duo and then there's Bats. The only other way I can justify it is if the post office heist was supposed to be Doc's last hurrah and it was a last minute thing so he didn't have time to plan it the way he normally does. But I'm willing to acquiesce here, this could have been better explained. 

Lazy writing though? I don't like that term in general, especially not for something that clearly Wright's been thinking about and putting together for the better part of two decades. The last term I'd used to describe him as either a writer or director is lazy. The reality is that he was probably stuck between a rock and a hard place. I would bet an earlier draft had a different team doing the post office heist, but also that the studio forced him to change that so that they could have a couple stars in it for longer and so that they wouldn't have to pay two more actors I guess, and he couldn't figure out a better way to make that work.

2) I think it was probably a combo of them not trusting each other and the timing needing to be so precise that they couldn't take the risk. This is a nitpick though, who cares?",6jxijs

djj0lpw,"I think it was a combination of both. You think if it was Bats or one of the other criminals walking in with a girl that he would help them? No way. In a way, he felt responsible for Baby. Like I said, he basically birthed Baby. Forced him into a life a crime and gave him a new name all at a very young age. At that point in the movie, all was lost. Baby was running away and the job was fucked. Baby came to him in his time of need because he was like a father to him. When Deb came in, he realized that Baby was serious. He cared about Baby and it was obvious why he did. ",6jxijs

do7mxuv,"It was definitely KS seeing they were in love that caused his actions but I don't think it's simply the cheap, nonsensical way to resolve the plot that people are making it out to be. KS's character was packing up in a hurry because he knew the Butcher's men were in route to take revenge for the actions of his crew and he could have easily escaped in time had he not just left when Baby appeared. However seeing Baby's love for Debora and returning for his mom's​ tape makes him hesitate for a moment too late. KS realized that despite grooming Baby towards the lucrative path of a career criminal, Baby made the decision (the necessity for Baby to make decisions is an important and prevalent theme in the film) for love over crime, which KS realizes and remarks that he was 'in love once' implying he chose crime instead. His apparent sudden change in character is likely a result of KS regretting his choice of crime over love along with his new found respect for Baby who made the decision that he could not. With hitmen in route and cops likely not far behind, KS knew that his hesitation had already ruined his chance to escape and decided to help Baby despite knowing he would surely die and ultimately redeeming him for the decision for crime over love, resolving his character's internal conflict. Being forever freed from KS, killing Bobby who'd never stop hunting Baby and surrendering in the end complete Baby's escape from crime resolving the main conflict. If KS did not have this change of heart towards Baby and got away he would surely further harass, blackmail and threaten Baby, not allowing him to escape the life of a criminal and leaving the main conflict unresolved even if Baby still killed Bobby and surrendered.",6jxijs

I imagined more that Doc would try to kill Baby for how much Baby sabotaged the whole ordeal. ,6jxijs
djp6bph,"[I kinda got that turn. I mean Doc probably figured he was screwed anyway and the cops were gonna find him; his nephew was used to case the post office which would lead to him fairly quick. I also think Doc shows he kinda cares for Baby throughout the film when he does stuff like defend him from Bats. He totally abuses him too by making him do the last job(the other jobs could be considered generous as he normally would kill someone who stole his car and presumably drugs/cash). He also gives Baby a cut at the end of each job which he didn't have to do. Another thing is he seems genuinely hurt when Baby uses Monsters Inc. lines.](#spoiler)

[I think Doc cares for Baby but he is also a rather ruthless criminal so manipulates him till the end where he redeems himself and sees himself in Baby(the line about love), figuring he has little to lose(life in jail or on the run/death anyway by Buddy) he decided to die saving Baby.](#spoiler)",6jxijs

At most a month or two? Also, she didn't go to jail for helping a man escape from the cops for a crime that resulted in several deaths. 

The dialogue was cheesy and not in a good way that's endearing to the character. And the plot just fell apart at the end.

That's not 'plot gymnastics', it's a pretty tried-and-tested sequence in crime drama.",6jxijs
dk3zgtm,"Indeed. He always looked for Baby's take on things and stood up for him to the others. Doc wanted to use him as long as he could, but when that was no longer practical, he'd rather see Baby gone than dead.

I just watched it a second time and there's a moment in the scene after Bats finds Baby's recorder and they're going through his tapes that hints of what happens at the end.

Baby plays ""Was He Slow?"" for them and then the crew notices the Debora tape and realizes it was the waitress at the diner. At that point Doc sighs and gets an annoyed/resigned look on his face and tells them to send Baby home and that they'll get another driver.

Now that the others (especially Bats) are aware of and suspicious of Debora too, Doc knows she/they are in danger (and that things are falling apart/getting even more complicated) and is *finally willing to let Baby leave.*",6jxijs
dk1wqrv,"I don't understand the soft spot. For the entire movie he is portrayed as an evil crime boss. Like how much connection was actually built between the two? I'm trying to do the math here. If he is paying off the stolen benz, how many jobs does it take to do that? Plus, each job is split equally it was said. What I'm trying to get at is if he had to do a ton of jobs, then I can understand that he developed a soft spot. But if all he to do was a couple jobs to pay off the benz (which is more likely), than how can a soft spot be developed, let alone why would he sacrifice his life for a kid he barely knew and that just destroyed his entire operation.",6jxijs

When you watch him dance in the driver's seat, it's a sorta private moment and he dances like no one is watching.

Dance/jam like no one's watching. That'd what I felt like his ""cool"" strut felt like the entire film. He does it all the time, and almost has to because of his tinnitus.  

As for the conversation, I very felt they reached total tarintino level. The other heist  characters almost felt like half caricatures/mostly cliche on purpose. Tarintino characters feel so over the top and weird, they all feel unique and almost pretensious.

And they developed that relationship in more than just a few scenes here and there, it was many years instead of a couple of days. It just didn't sit right with me that she immediately fell for and waited around 5 years for some stranger she doesn't know. That is, if the scene at the end wasn't ""all a dream"" for artistic reasons. Ah well I guess most of the users in this topic seem to really like the movie, which surprises me but them's the breaks.

Basically, what we as the audience can infer from knowing more about Baby directly, I saw Debora being able to piece together just based on how much Baby seemed to hate doing his job, and then finding out the precise reasons why.

> a summer blockbuster

I guess I say that because it's a simple story with broad appeal. It's not some niche-indie-art-house piece trying to make a point about something or tell a disenfranchised story. There's an obvious protagonist going up against the bad guys and our protagonist wins and gets the girl. It's a feel good movie, that's why Doc helps Baby in the end.

It shows that he is not just an innocent kid that is bound to help out on heists - he knows the drill for getting rid of bodies for a mob figure. The fact that he doesn't seem to be that bothered about covering up a murder is the point; he goes from high school chemistry teacher Mr. White cooking meth out of desperation to I just melted a body in a bathtub because I don't care if my hands are dirty Walter White in the eyes of the audience. Without this scene his character is a lot less interesting because he's is such an obvious good guy in a bad situation, it adds a lot of grey to his whole situation.

Also, when he's coming back from getting coffee after having a gun in his face by Jaime Foxx's character he is noticeably shaken and scared. Remember? He bumps into some guy on the curb and is shifty during the scene where Spacey is divvying up the cash. It isn't until he walks away from the compactor and tosses his gloves that he starts his groovy walk again to the song ""Easy"" comes on. He dances, sings, and kicks the trash in a care free way - you'd have to be blind not to notice that a weight has been lifted from his shoulders.

Pay attention to someone like Judge Wraith in Black Mirror, he's supposed to be American (albeit some sort of post-apocalyptic version) but his real accent sneaks through way too much. Also, the writing of Americans in Black Mirror could use a lot of work. Charlie Brooker will have an American character say something like ""Do you wanna come back to mine?"" which doesn't sound all that out of place, but it's not a natural thing for someone from the US to say.

But in comes Bats, a guy who's so messed up that he's just killing people for fun. It disturbs Baby.

That sort of fiscal instability would mess with his mental state, and an 8 hour shift delivering pizzas could leave him drained and not ready for the job.

As for the amount of money, it's not enough to live the high life, but you also want to give him a taste of luxury so that after he's all paid up, he's more willing to continue to work.

Everyone else would've been played better by another actor.",6jxijs
dn924n7,"I know I'm two months late and you've probably already forgotten about this comment and movie, but I feel like everyone is always forgetting about the stakeout scene for the Post office job, where Spacey's character brought his Nephew. 

It shows that he does care about ""family"" and his ""chip of the old block"" nephew is clearly learning a lot from his Uncle with his ability to quickly identify all the info needed to carry out the job in record time. He's been doing the same thing with Baby ever since Spacey's character looked on him with admiration at the balls he had for boosting his car when he was a child. 

Couple that with what you've stated before about his constant praise and defense of Baby's driving skills, giving him a cut, and the fact that he's trusted him enough to bring him on most of the jobs he's had since Baby was a little kid, it's entirely plausible for Spacey to end up giving his life for Baby, even though I'm sure he wasn't expecting to go out like he did. 

Baby could be considered just as much ""family"" as his Nephew. I know that's possibly going too far, but upon seeing Baby with his girl and the ""I was in love once"" line, I believe Spacey would want to see Baby prosper, or at least get out of this situation alive to have a chance at life. In that tense and time constrained situation, the quick change of heart is believable, especially since Spacey already knew about Debora, but possibly not about how serious they were together...Why else would Baby even have her with him, bringing her to Spacey's place in this situation if it weren't incredibly serious?",6jxijs

djyjvuh,"It requires more forethought and effort on the production part. You need to know the music you are using before you get into post production. There are two categories of music in film, diegetic and non-diegetic. Diegetic takes place within the universe of the film and the characters can hear it. Non-diegetic is the underscore that only the audience is hearing. I feel there was some nice blurring of lines in this film between the two.

The other thing when editing shots is they want to capture action/reaction and different emotions. A lot of orchestral scores do get synched to picture because they record against picture with timings down to the frame. After the scenes have already been cut and edited. But you don't get that luxury when the majority of the film music is pre-recorded. So it requires a lot of finesse throughout the entire production process.",6jxijs

You walk outside and you're about to walk to your car, and in the distance you see your car door is open, and someone is rummaging through the shit in there. They eventually get in, close the door, and hotwire the car, proceeding to then take off in probably a visually impressive manner in keeping with Edgar Wright's style.

Until you see the impressive burnout/spin/whatever, you have no idea that this kid is a driving prodigy. All you know is that there's some dude in your fucking car. You have no reason to allow this to happen. Them being in your debt means nothing to you until you see his skill, which you don't see until after you've already tolerated the violation of your property for way longer than a crime lord generally should.

""But wait!"", I hear you asking, ""What if he didn't come out until Baby was already driving his car? Then he wouldn't have seen the break-in itself!""

Except Doc specifically says he saw it happening and *allowed it* ""because of the balls"", which as previously mentioned makes no sense because nobody's supposed to know who Doc is, thus breaking into his car means nothing to the average street thug.",6jxijs

Would it be more realistic to show how long it actually takes to relieve yourself and then to wash your hands properly? Sure, but its also a little boring and unnecessary and if anything adds to the humor/charm of the scene.

I'd argue Spacey's last scene is another example of this scene but even more exaggerated. Wright sacrificed realism and made a joke out of the ""initial villain sacrifices themselves for the hero to defeat new unexpected villain"" trope by skipping the logic entirely.

Trying to convince the audience that something in Spacey's character's past was so impactful that it'd make him have a change of heart was never going to work, so instead they said let's not convince anyone and boil it down to a single line.

No, because Jamie Foxx and his two guys and the guy from the first job didn't know Baby, and Doc uses Baby on every job. So all of these people are new, which seems like bad planning to work with new people each time, IMO.

I don't think he was ever serious. I'm sure he feels responsible for him: when Baby needed help he trusted that KS's character would help him instead of punishing him for messing up - like the guy with the tatts in group 2.

dk0aato,"Yeah I need to re-watch it when I'm in a better mood, I enjoyed the movie overall. ",6jxijs
dk34fyv,"I think it's further implied by how the audience can hear the prison guard talk to him when he gets his mail. Almost all of the sound in the movie is from Baby's perspective, so if they wanted to convey that he completely lost his hearing, they could have had the guard either not talk or make his line inaudible to the viewer.",6jxijs
djp6k43,"That reminds me, he is literally seeing red in the end with the red lights from the cop car shining in his face.",6jxijs
djp0lr3,Ya I guess so. But it could have been dealt with better. Guess I expected more from Edgar Wright. Maybe if he had used some of the funny camera work he's known for it would have made it more interesting.,6jxijs
djoy0su,"It makes me think that maybe this supposed to be making fun from other movies? It feels like it was overdone on purpose? I mean he is being shot, and stays in place like he is the  terminator. ",6jxijs
djpq1ao,"It's also Edgar Wright just playing with convention a bit. With this kind of story--along with having Kevin Spacey in the role--you'd expect Doc to be one of the big antagonists of the movie, but instead he just goes, ""fuck it, okay, I'll help.""",6jxijs
djpm3sr,Humans are known to have sudden turns of heart.,6jxijs
djsc85y,"It's also because he knew he was getting arrested, I think he was like ""fuck it, might as well"".

And it's obvious he had a bit of a soft spot for Baby, even if he denied it. ",6jxijs
djp7i8b,"Yeah.  You got the feeling that Doc admired his driving and his talent, but not that he cared for him as a person *at all*. The flip came out of nowhere and had no emotional weight, because I was half 'hey, what the fuck, where did that come from' and half 'oh, I'm glad he's dead, I mean wasn't he the bad guy?'",6jxijs
djp6i34,"I saw those little moments, but there was so little warmth from spacey towards the kid, and his character was so gimmicky, that it just didn't parse with me.  He was too much the antagonist, had been too much the main author of Baby's problems, for that change to hold wait.

If he'd even said ""I'm sorry, it's my fault you're in this mess"" I could have bought it.  But that vibe never came across for me.",6jxijs
djpfe8w,"I doubt the cops would know who Doc's nephew is. Not something that would be back to him.

The problem though is the pissed off cops on his payroll know Doc's crew killed their boys and did the post office job. That's why he's getting the fuck out. ",6jxijs
djqubl0,Yeah if he paused for even like 5-10 seconds I'd be convinced he really thought about it but the scene came off as unnatural.,6jxijs
djqucxm,They probably bought it from the Butcher though and I think he said they were untraceable and if he didn't he probably implied it.,6jxijs
djty610,"I'm aware of the films being refrenced, Edgar Wright is up there with Christopher Nolan for me. Not sure what I was thinking waiting, even if it was a joke scene, it would've been epic.",6jxijs
djtssea,"Ah, gotcha.",6jxijs
djvhhcd,Oh yeah that is missing a word. Thanks for pointing that out. ,6jxijs
dk2w9y7,Can you claim self-defense if you kill an accomplice during the course of the felony that both of you are already committing?,6jxijs
djunf0x,"Eh, I went into the movie not knowing anything about it other than my brother recommended it and I feel pretty much the same as the other guy. 

The dialogue was bad IMO, ""I don't squeal to the cops, I squeal on the streets"" and other just really corny lines that that maybe were supposed to show that Baby wasn't this hardened criminal or whatever. But I also could not STAND Baby. His acting just didn't seem great and I felt like he had no chemistry with anybody else in the movie. ",6jxijs
djp35ag,That's exactly what I meant ,6jxijs
djpbl0g,"Granted, but people endlessly complaining about it is practically as annoying as the practice itself. ",6jxijs
djuqcsj,Well... that's my point?,6jxijs
djnpylk,"Nowhere does the movie imply they bang, unless you really try hard to make yourself believe it (:",6jxijs
djro7rm,"More like, you're in love forever if you have one thing in common.",6jxijs
djnqnsu,I don't understand what that means. ,6jxijs
djlokjj,"And as a result it just feels rather aimless as a movie. It's not funny enough to be a comedy movie, there's no investment on my part during the action scenes at the end, and the bit of thriller in the middle is just there. ",6jxijs
djjgjqr,"Okay, that makes me feel better about everything good haha",6jxijs
djlbmfl,Then why specifically call out his use of Baby?,6jxijs
djmvshf,"Yes, but they got the tapes AFTER he agreed to go through with the heist.",6jxijs
djwn559,The judge said federal pen.,6jxijs
djuq7mc,"Yeah that John Hamm shit was dumb, they could have made the movie kind of well paced and way way more plausible if he was ALREADY dating the girl from the diner. We wouldn't sit through 30 minutes of bad flirting and there would be less of a problem with me believing that she's ditching her life for him. I can't believe this, probably being the number 1 complained about cliche, made it into a movie this mainstream and the number of people who think it's perfect",6jxijs
dkchl7k,"If he had called off the last heist, surely Bats or Buddy wouldn't have taken it well and likely would've done something to Baby.

By saying they should do the heist, he has a chance to catch them off guard and disappear (though they called his bluff).",6jxijs
dkenlm3,"Yeah, I saw a few parallels in their relationship and Peter Quill and Yondu's relationship in the Guardians of the Galaxy films. A tough but tender mentor, who would then [die for his ward.](#spoiler)",6jxijs
djotjow,"That's fine, I don't have an issue with Baby turning on his crew.

But at the beginning of the movie are you saying to yourself ""gee, I can't wait to see this Buddy/Baby showdown at the end of the movie!""?",6jxijs
dk41s0q,The way Doc treated his nephew suggested another soft spot. He's happy to use people but he doesn't wish them ill.,6jxijs
dk27yk6,"He never was as tough as he makes himself seem. As he points out, he likes the kid from the moment he met him. 

Instead of being tough on him when the kid stole his Benz he gave him a job. Instead of using him once like his other crews, he keeps using the kid. Instead of taking the safe route and killing the kid as soon as they find out about the recordings, he actually drops the entire subject on faith as soon as he hears a song.

Spacey had been cutting that kid slack from the moment they first met. As for a kid he barely knew, Spacey said it was his business to know *everything*. He knew exactly how nice the kid is outside his job and what kind of person he is.",6jxijs
dk23ita,"Spacey also said he had some merch in the Benz that Baby had apparently dumped, not realizing its worth. Baby was paying back that, not the Benz.",6jxijs
dk5j868,Baby was working for him for over 10 years though. He met baby when he was like 12. They had plenty of time to developer a relationship.,6jxijs
dk22d46,It wasn't just the Benz that he was paying off. It was the merc inside it as well. ,6jxijs
djhtmtm,"Imagine if you had seen Baby's Driver before Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz?  Disappointment, thy name is hype.",6jxijs
djhtt2a,"Agreed. Went with some people who thought it matched Hot Fuzz, and  I think they're being ridiculous",6jxijs
djz24dj,How many movies do you walk out of?,6jxijs
dk0e5zb,"Seems pretty drastic to walk out of a movie a a half-hour in, especially with all the action and gags. What exactly were you expecting?",6jxijs
djrn7z9,I guess he didn't realize they were in love when he saw them at the restaurant.,6jxijs
djvz6wb,"Good deal, my friend ",6jxijs
djomhuj,"Well legally speaking he would have been far better off. They can't prove any of his other crimes so far as we know so it would just be this one armed robbery. The real issue for him though is that he would still have killed bats in this scenario. Even murdering one person is enough to get a life sentence. Maybe he could spin it that he was trying to save lives by doing so and could get off, but it would be an uphill climb. At least he is a young, attractive white guy that would definitely make him a more sympathetic defendant. ",6jxijs
djnxrui,"That's a fair point. But in that case, it's a pretty dark ending to a film that felt more lighthearted than its plot (if that makes sense). 

IMO the dark comedy that handles this kind of ending perfectly is Bad Santa. A lot of movie voiceover is careless and terrible IMO, but in the case of Bad Santa it fits very well. It's a happy but still realistic ending. That kind of ending wouldn't necessarily have worked with Baby Driver, but my point is Baby Driver needed a more elegant ending. Maybe I'll feel differently when I watch it again, but at this point the ending just feels a bit clumsy and ill-fitting to me. ",6jxijs
djlrn55,"Understandable. I absolutely loved it, my only gripe was the turn Doc made at the end of the movie, while foreshadowed slightly in the beginning, was a bit abrupt.",6jxijs
djuyfq2,"someone really spends all that time making inside jokes to themselves?  I think he actually thought it was cool to do that, not as a joke.",6jxijs
dk0mkej,"Well then you shouldn't assume I ""missed"" anything. Because, you know, I could've not missed a thing and still not liked it. As you said, ""different views"". ",6jxijs

djlh10c,I'm really lucky to have a non-chain cineplex right across the street. ,6jxijs
djrnibp,That's the definition of shoddy writing. You can't write a character with motivations so you slap a half assed love story to take care of that.,6jxijs
djn4avs,His motivation could have been the old man. The threats to him and the girl got him going. ,6jxijs
djy3640,Ok That's a fair point. It does feel like Edgar Wright pitched it like this hip fresh modern take on a classic 60s 70s style action movie...so that's applicable. Not really new or saying something tho on that ground alone. ,6jxijs
dk203sc,"Damned if you do, damned if you don't. There will always be people complaining about movies failing the Bechdel test, and then a bunch of other people complaining about how women are supposedly shoehorned into things without any reason other than equality.",6jxijs
djthlz7,"Yeah I thought for sure, Doc was going to call Jon Bernthal to come finish off baby after Baby went rogue.  I mean they even set Bernthal up in the begining as an antagonist to Baby.  And then Jon Hamm would have come around and saved Baby, because the two lovers thing.  ",6jxijs
djqpxyc,Yeah but what's the alternative?  He gets his legs broken and everyone he cares about eats a bullet.  It's said almost verbatim in the film.  Baby had no choice in the matter.,6jxijs
djqunsl,"Well, it's kinda poignant.  He went to so much trouble to rescue that tape of his mother singing and in the end he couldn't hear it.  But like his tinnitus, his regret had passed too, because he had Debora.",6jxijs
djqul14,"I heard that line and thought he was going to start playing Souljah Boy on the radio and start an argument.

I'm glad he didn't.",6jxijs
djr5fje,"I was unsure as well, considering how out of place the New York iconography is in Atlanta, but it really made sense to me for the Wall Street dialog to have more depth than just a reason Buddy would have ""a guy"" a bit later.",6jxijs
djr517n,"I did just find someone else bringing up similar points in the official discussion. I'd link but I'm on mobile and it kind of sucks. 

I'm surprised more people weren't talking about it, but this movie has a ton to talk about so I'm not *too* surprised.  

Oh and something that I thought of when I was writing in the other thread: Bats wearing red is also a cape for us. He's not just what gets the bull riled up. He's the distraction for the audience as well, before we see that Buddy is the real danger. ",6jxijs
djr3o1e,I really liked how organized this discourse was.,6jxijs
dk0f0c0,Yeah the lighting in that scene was cool,6jxijs
djzoa62,I hope so. I knew nothing about the movie going in so it was a really nice surprise for me. Plus I live in Atlanta so it was cool to see the city represented so accurately. ,6jxijs
djl52bj,"I never got the impression Baby was projecting a hate that he was driving when he was with Deborah, he just kept this vague and mysterious. Sure, the audience sees him hating the gig when he's doing it and interacting with the crew but Deb doesn't see that framing. 

Deb's perspective: she meets a mysterious guy who drives (she believes he chauffeurs), he says he's not working anymore, then has to work again, she sees him with a group of people (Deb doesn't know their relationship, are they his friends? Work associates?) and Baby is quiet/evasive the whole time and pretends he doesn't know her (she never sees Bats pull the gun), Deb gets a weird vibe but nothing conclusive, Baby leaves the note to run away, blows her off, then Buddy shows up later with a gun and Baby shoots him, she chooses to join him without knowing ANY context to anything happening, more death and violence, murder without any explanation and then goes along with him again. 

Dammit, this makes me sound like i didn't really dig the movie (I did!). I just seem to have an issue with this plot development. ",6jxijs
dk1m56y,I think that was supposed to signify that his family wasn't wealthy.,6jxijs

Doc is not the criminal mastermind he is for having random sympathy.  He'd do it just out of principle. ,6jxijs

djm7fyr,"To be fair, there aren't strict definitions of the phrase, but if you google summer blockbuster and look at the first bunch of results they tend to have these factors in common:

* big budget
* big leading actors/director/production
* big marketing
* mass appeal plot 

I also don't argue that the movie is fun, and follows a traditional trope of good guy protagonist fighting adversity to get the girl. But that isn't reserved for blockbuster movies either, right? 

I think our definitions of what makes a summer blockbuster are just different. I generally go by ""this studio paid a ton of money to make this movie and they're banking on it being huge"" as my benchmark. I don't see that being the case with Baby Driver. None of this is a criticism of the movie itself, which I greatly enjoyed.",6jxijs

djic86c,"This 100%. My tinnitus has been awful the last few days (Meniere's disease), and my office floor is so quiet that I feel my worst when I'm here listening to nothing except for how much my ear wants to explode from the ringing. Background noise/music helps drown it out.

Also, when my tinnitus is loud, the only way I can focus on conversations is if I'm reading the person's lips to put it together. It's not unbelievable at all the Baby would listen to music while Doc would go on about their heist plan and be able to dictate it back verbatim. ",6jxijs
dji86xm,"True but it's still there and it's just as loud you are just not focussed on it. Let me ask you though, if a TV is on in your home but it's on silent, do you know it's on without seeing it?

It'd make sense seeing as Bernthal was trying to see what made Baby tick and was quick to push him to the edge in the beginning of the movie. It could've played into the bully vs nerd dynamic, something that would've been very satisfying to see on screen.

I think Doc's actions were taken because he saw a path for Baby that he himself had lost, proved by the ""I was in love once"" line he gave. It wasn't so much about helping Baby as it was nurturing a new life for someone that he probably wished he was able to have.",6jxijs

",6jxijs
djtzz22,"I saw that moment to be him realizing the situation Baby was in. Like instead of him being in it for money or himself, he really was just trying to get out of a shitty situation for the people he cared about. 

The change when he saw Debora wasn't because ""Aw they're in love"" but more that he finally fully saw himself in Baby. He noticed that Baby was put in that situation because of him and he's essentially responsible for making a clone of himself. At that point he had two options of either dying while leaving Baby to die/begin the same life he did, or die and allow Baby a chance at a better one.",6jxijs
dk6b9m1,"I do wonder if it's because he realized he forced him into this one, this was the first time Baby wasn't driving because of a debt.

And it's likely he knows that Bats caused the gun deal to go wrong, and again Baby got forced into shit that he didn't really want to do.

djnj6iy,"I don't know about that. I think he was being genuine about it. 

Baby was introduced to two brand crews in the first 20 minutes. You'd think Doc might have used Buddy or Batz or Whoever before, but they all clearly are just meeting Baby for the first time. Baby even looks surprised when he walks into the final meeting and sees Buddy, Darling and Bats there again. 

I think Baby really was the only constant member of the teams and Doc actually had some kind of attachment to him. Whether it's because he drives well or otherwise, as he does seem genuinely upset with Baby for the recordings and didn't just kill him on the spot like he did to the Asian guy. He even defers judgement to him one final time and lets him do the job, which unfortunately was the wrong choice, and he paid the price for trusting him. ",6jxijs
djjas44,"We'll he is a criminal. He's not above murder and threats, obviously.  
  
Being that he's not one to hold grudges or seek revenge beyond what is practical and necessary, I buy that he would go to bat for Baby in the end. He knew Bats was a psycho after he killed the Butcher and he probably learned about how Bats acted at the diner and in the convenience store too. So with the murder at the post office, I don't think it's a stretch to say Doc understands why Baby killed him.  
  
And once Doc has no crew or job to salvage, he decides to defend Baby from one of the other crew members like he always has.

dm9tm05,"Because Hollywood filmmakers seem to have an obsession with everything having to take place in a major city. It's always a story in LA or New York or Dubai or Berlin or Tokyo or Hong Kong or London or wherever. Why *can't* it be a story in the actual location that you filmed at? 

People from Atlanta actually get to say, ""Hey! I recognize that place! He's actually driving around X neighborhood in Atlanta!"" Wright didn't even decide to have it set in Atlanta until he approved of the filming locations. And from that moment forward, in the story itself and not just in production, it was set in Atlanta.

Filming something in the same location that the story is actually set also carries a weight of realism to it because you actually get a tone for what that place feels like. Dunkirk was filmed *at* Dunkirk and you can feel the desolation of The Mole. Creed was filmed in Philadelphia and takes place in Philadelphia and you can feel the character of the city and what it's like. Filming in the actual location lends the undertones of realism and verisimilitude to your movie that the audience can sense, whether they recognize it or not.",6jxijs

djr6135,"I understood what you were saying. What I meant is, 

Typically, a person with the healthy inner ear usually experiences tinnitus and/or partial deafness after having one of certain types fired too close to their ear. It can burst their eardrum (which doesn't always heal well) or worse, affect the inner ear area - such as fracturing or dislodging the ear bone, or corrupting the cochlea, canal or auditory nerve somehow. When one of those is fucked, tinnitus and/or hearing loss usually turns up. 

It's obvious that in having tinnitus, Buddy's cochlea is damaged. Has been since his childhood. So when he was deafened - evidently from his damaged cochlea taking *another* hit - from Buddy's shooting, it won't be easy for his damaged-again cochlea to recover that easily. It'll either worsen his tinnitus and/or deafen him to a degree. He might get some of his hearing back, but it won't be as much as he had before the shooting.

And the purpose of having a new team each time is so the cops can't link the robberies together. So by the last robbery Doc no longer had a need to keep the cops thinking the crimes were unrelated because there wasn't going to be another one. Seems logical in that case to use the most recent people as they're more likely to still be around.

And as for Baby, yeah it was stupid to keep using him especially as he did end up being linked to more than one robbery but 1. Where would Doc find another driver like him and 2.

BUT ANYWAY, my original point was that even though the depictions of women were unrealistic (and frankly demeaning), THAT DOESN'T MATTER, because the point of the film was that it was a stylistic masterpiece, with a simple plot that was basically a fantasy (which we could see literally in Baby's fantasizing about Debora).

Different character.  Doc can very well have different feelings about the expendability of different associates.  He doesn't have to treat them all the same.  Asian guy was clearly incompetent.  Isn't he also the one who bought the wrong masks? 

> Doc is not the criminal mastermind he is for having random sympathy. He'd do it just out of principle. 

If that were true, he would never have given Baby a chance to redeem himself when he stole the car when he was little.

dk4rqwg,"I perceived the movie, it's plot, and it's characters very differently than you. I found development in almost all of the characters, both subtle and not so subtle. All with very specific, important character traits that define each one and tell more about them. It's a very meticulously edited film that glorifies the escape that music can give people. Baby isn't just using the music to drown out the tinnitus, he's using it to escape the world around him. Which is the whole plot of the film. It's not about ""One Last Score"", it was  about his escape from his lifestyle. I found Jon Hamm's character to be wildly entertaining at the end. Considering he spent the whole movie putting on a mask of coolness only to have it cracked once he lost his youth in the form of a young promiscuous wife. The whole movie was like a cartoon. Almost all of the scenes were shot in sync with the soundtrack. That was pretty surrealistic in itself. It gave the film such a smooth rhythm.

dn91ox6,"I know I'm two months late on this comment but I think they did enough to show why Spacey helped Baby out. 

Aside from the ""I was in love once line"", he brought his nephew to a stake out, in which the nephew proved that he was a ""chip of the old block"" by being able to identify and memorize everything he needed to know at the post office in record time. 

I believe this scene really shows that he cares about family and seeing them prosper, and is raising his nephew the same way he ""raised"" and brought up Baby. His methods may be wrong and the ""world"" he's raising them up certainly isn't the right one, but in his mind, Spacey's character certainly feels like Baby is part of his family and certainly cares for him.

When Spacey dropped Baby off at home after the stakeout, it genuinely seems like he wanted Baby to use his skills to make bank and prosper like he has. Baby was technically ""out"", and though it seemed like Spacey didn't give him a choice to refuse the job, he also seemed like he really wanted him to make it in this business. 

So seeing everything turn to shit at the end and assuming that the job going wrong is a serious problem for Spacey's character, he takes the time to give his only protege, his lucky charm, and his best driver who's never done him wrong, a chance to get out alive and live a possible life that Spacey's character never had the chance to have. 

Who knows if ""I was in love once"" meant that he was in the same situation once, or if he lost her in another unrelated means but it doesn't really matter. With his character showing that he cares, him seeing Baby with his girl, can quickly change his mind in a believable way in the tense, time constrained situation they were in.

dk5izxp,"A response to your question.. No. I wouldn't find that odd at all. I don't think it matters either way. I don't think there is anything sexist, unrealistic, or demeaning about those types of portrayals of men or women, because such people do exist in the world, and they can be useful characters in a story. What IS sexist, however, is the fact that women are so often exclusively portrayed in that way. I understand the push to see more women characters that get the depth and respect that they deserve, (which is one reason I'm excited to see Atomic Blonde, hopefully it delivers) I don't think there is anything wrong about having these ""traditional"" female stereotypes.",6jxijs
djlgdip,"Especially the 2am scene when he said road trip. You could sense the tension when they walked in, especially when bats said the diner sucks.

djp19mn,"All 3 of those guys were serial killers.

Serial killer: A serial killer is typically a person who murders three or more people, usually in service of abnormal psychological gratification, with the murders taking place over more than a month and including a significant break (a ""cooling off period"") between them. Different authorities apply different criteria when designating serial killers;while most set a threshold of three murders, others extend it to four or lessen it to two.

djno90u,"> Because you got downvoted in the internet.

Like I've been saying, the downvoting is evidence of an echo chamber developing around this IP.  It's not that ""I"" got downvoted, but rather the reason why people would downvote a comment expressing curiosity and mild apprehension.  That sounds like an intolerance for any sort of dissenting opinion, which is reflective of a fairly strong bit of confirmation bias.  Kind of like your trolling.",6jxijs
djmifk3,"> No, because people were down voting your questions about the film, not the film. That isn't criticism of a movie, so they aren't critics.

It's being critical of anything other than unabashed praise for the movie, which is what this movie is currently surrounded by.  I obviously expressed a bit of apprehension, and that was enough for the pitchforks to come out.

dk4upvx,"You're entitled to your opinion which is obviously popular here. I don't think I over looked anything, it's nowhere near a great film and the ridiculous mention of the synchronicity of the sound/visuals is just, in my opinion, farcical. It's not a memorable movie and if anyone considers this ""great"" than we have a fundamental disagreement about film. At best it's a 90 minute music video. John Hamm becomes a cartoon character because of shitty writing. I feel like it's a contest among people to say who likes it more than anyone else and if you point out a contrary opinion you get the wrath of people. Edgar Wright is a guy who I've never had a strong opinion about previously, but I must say my opinion of him has gone down with the ""group think"" of his fans. ",6jxijs

Plus the aforementioned PSP games, which I cycle through a couple at a time due to space constraints, like Crazy Taxi 1 and 2.",6jxijs
dkv8hhs,Peace Walker is considered *the* PSP game by many,6jxijs
djoog2q,Well we'll have to agree to disagree.  Darling and Buddy came across as obnoxious teenage sweethearts not remorseless thrill seeking star crossed lovers.,6jxijs
djkup4d,"He goes out like a baller too, trying to shot gun blast Hamm",6jxijs
djpgy6o,I can totally get him the throwing a bone to Baby and helping them out because of the shared history. Him willing to **die** for baby felt out of character though. ,6jxijs
djpvzbc,"Yeah, I wasn't entirely sure how I felt about it to be honest. In the moment I liked it but was also confused. Immediately after the movie, I liked it because I thought it implied more nuance to his character than was immediately visible. It has implications of a story in his past that we never get to see, something that I really like from a world building perspective.

After finishing writing this comment, I've decided with certainty that I like having it in the movie.",6jxijs
drkay46,You hate Kevin spacey now?,6jxijs
hzldfb9,"I can see why you'd see it that way, but to me it was poorly executed and took me out of it.",6jxijs
dk6bcn3,"Well his intention wasn't exactly to sacrifice his life though, He'd already told baby that he'd need to run. And that was before the elevator doors even opened.",6jxijs
djpw0dh,"Fair, but also a threat without action is just an empty one. Whether he was really going to do it or not was unimportant. Like making a raise in poker. He thought the threat would be enough to keep Baby on as his driver and he wasn't wrong.",6jxijs
djph7rw,"And his rule is probably only so that the robberies won't be immediately connected to one another. Not so that he can't be caught. Best way to make robberies look like multiple gangs are commiting them is to actually have multiple gangs commit them. I would imagine most of them like bats, and darling & buddy probably have the lifespan of a mayfly. Dead or locked up  after 2 or 3 jobs.",6jxijs
djkuv8d,"Another thing that might be glossed over is that Baby went to Doc for help. Despite knowing that he ruined the job, Baby still trusted Doc enough that he would call and ask for help",6jxijs

djjrmfu,"Only Bats arguably wanted to kill him.  Jon Hamm and his girl had already talked about killing Bats in front of Baby and Spacey would not have killed him.  Spacey would not know he was running, all he would know is that Baby called off the job.  ",6jxijs

He was just a kid back then but he's got an immutable goodness inside of him that the movie goes out of its way to show the audience.

All Baby wanted was to steal a car. Cars have insurance. Instead, he stole a car that had a bunch of valuable merchandise in it. That doesn't have insurance on it. He stole far more than he intended, and felt bad about it.

When Doc breaks this agreement, this trust, that's a betrayal of the goodness that caused Baby to drive for him in the first place. Then on top of that he threatens him and everyone he cares about. To expect the relationship to just carry on afterward is extremely naive and stupidly out of character for Doc.",6jxijs

dji6thn,"That's my feeling, unresolved and incomplete. The story get rushed because there wasn't enough there there.",6jxijs
djo3uk0,"Yep, I am agreeing with you. ",6jxijs
dn11crh,"No. But I am saying that given the circumstances, its safer to assume he killed the shop keeper than simply stole shit. ",6jxijs
dn9k5pw,"> bats

Nah he has a robbery habit... or something like that.",6jxijs
dkfdze1,I mean that's not really the point is it?  I didn't say there has been a slew of fun movies that have come out. But if your looking for a counter point I literally have it - Shoot Em Up. A movie that is full a style but also has great fun in it too. ,6jxijs
djmjrnm,"> If you're questioning if it's as good as it is why not make your own mind up instead of making excuses.

How am I making up excuses?  How are you not also badgering me simply for holding my opinion?

> I loved it personally, you might not

Fairly certain I won't.

>you ain't gonna know unless you see it yourself

I've seen this type of logic used enough to know it doesn't hold any weight.    Just about every time I see a movie that I have apprehensions about simply because other people loved it I regret paying money to see the movie.",6jxijs
djodpp5,"> the one thing you have not answered is why any of those things would make you not want to see the movie

I've already answered that numerous times throughout this thread.

djn1uto,"No I totally understand that sentiment and i get that. I just didn't like the way it played out, like I said it was literally just him. All of the other characters were fine and well written, well potrayed and visually the movie was amazingly well done seriously I only hated him. ",6jxijs

djij1x8,"I couldn't care any less what you think or anyone else on reddit. I just made this account to ask for a link to watch the movie and you got your panties in a bunch.  
Leave me alone and get a life
Thanks m8 have a good day",6jxijs
djsnz2j,Doc straight up tells them to buy masks individually at different times so that it's not suspicious ,6jxijs
djqn011,Except it's all subjective. Who are you to decide what constitutes as obnoxious?,6jxijs
djywsf0,"Like when he's getting interrogated in the limo, he just repeats what Walter said about Bunny kidnapping herself, without being able to articulate any additional thoughts. ",6jxijs

djpvqmu,Jon Bernthal? The Punisher? Didn't know his name was Red Herring.,6jxijs
djoouu2,"I'm happy for you dude.  I love Edgar Wrigt, I don't know why I'm not seeing what everyone else is seeing.",6jxijs
dlbbfo6,Yeah I mean he was maybe just hoping to mow whoever it was down and get outta there.,6jxijs
djjnjgf,"yeah we all live for the moment to be the hero, even if some won't admit it. We conceal carry and everyone has that thought that they might stop a robbery and be a hero. Watch hell or high water for a more realistic depiction of this type of person.


Regardless it took me out of the scene because it just made me laugh at the absurdity HOWEVER I'm not talking shit or anything. It made sense in the movie for you so that's cool man. No worries at all",6jxijs
djr3i8e,"Yeah the pistol is entirely realistic. An MP5 machine pistol is not. That is an investment, not something you carry around to use. Automatic weapons are insanely expensive to get and as short as that weapon was he might have been committing a felony just due to barrel length. As it stands I've never known anyone who owns automatic weapons to be dumb enough to tote them around in the open. Losing one due to theft would be financially and legally nightmarish. ",6jxijs
dnu0p6q,">  You can keep your sympathy

oh please tell me what to do with my sympathy. ",6jxijs
djkwy6j,">Let's give it a few years and see how many people remember it. 
  
...most of wright's movies are already remembered",6jxijs
dl2lz2y,Yawn. ,6jxijs
dkgcow6,They're both very fun movies to me.,6jxijs
djmk5oz,"Because your opinion makes no sense, all I see is spite. The internet people were mean to me so I can't lower myself to liking the same movie as them. But whatever I'll stop ""badgering"" you as you're clearly too stubborn and presumptuous.",6jxijs
djpjz8d,[deleted],6jxijs
dk9qrll,"Alright so I'll say this: I liked the movie due to its timing and the way it was edited. I thought having everything times to music was going to be a gimmick that I would be too aware of as the movie went on, but after the first ten minutes I got into the rhythm of it and I didn't notice it anymore, and it was fantastic. Occasionally I was made aware of it with timed gunshots, but overall it never felt overused or in your face, it was just part of what drove the movie. The editing was also great. A lot of people say there were too many cuts in the car chases, but you can't do what Edgar wanted to do in a single shot sequence. Overall it was fun, enjoyable and definitely worth a rewatch in my opinion.",6jxijs
djijfgr,"just don't ask for links to movies that just came out in theaters.

Piracy is a crime ",6jxijs
