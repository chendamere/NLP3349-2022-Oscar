drkpz7h,"This is one of those instances where I don't really need a plot for the movie to work for me. I just want Hugh Jackman showboating, and I'm getting my money's worth.",7l6grk
drt3ijb,Hugh riding that elephant to his daughter's recital was so extra. ,7l6grk
drkraty,"This film was quite enjoyable to me. 


Score and musical numbers all wonderful and expertly shot (the director did previously work in music videos so I guess that shouldn't come as a surprise.)


Jackman is wonderful, Zendaya is wonderful, Efron is wonderful, Rebecca Ferguson is passable (although don't miss that her singing is not her - it's Voice finalist Loren Allred). Michelle Williams is sweet enough, though she seemed uncomfortable and out of place at times.


The biggest issue for me (and it didn't ruin the movie) is that the subject matter is not correct. Barnum was no wide-eyed dreamer who longed to shelter and nurture the misunderstood. He was a conman who would do anything to make a buck, at the expense of people with genetic deformities and animals. The issue for the viewer is choosing whether or not to reconcile movie Barnum with real-life Barnum.

Altogether, the wisest decision this movie should've made would've been to make this movie about someone else- a fictional showman. That way the ties to Barnum for the viewer could be cut. And let's be real, here - the movie would've been just as memorable without all those ridiculously CGI animals (whose only purpose was to heighten an already-mind-numbing spectacle and, ironically, remind the viewers that Barnum was a monster to animals.)

A solid B- of a film - worth a popcorn watch and I'd probably buy it on DVD.",7l6grk
drlue9j,"I loved this movie! I thought the music and choreography was awesome. I don’t really understand the hate it’s getting. I know some people are upset it isn’t historically accurate, but we went in for a show and we got one. ",7l6grk
drq2yl9,"I have been listening to the soundtrack on repeat since I got it. I really like it FAR more than i had thought I would. 

The singing was fantastic. The choreography was amazing. I want to see it again just to watch that. 

The pacing was great. It didn't feel like it dragged anywhere. The subtly of the ""Never Enough"" scene was breathtaking. The singing, the framing, the back and forth between the actors (facial expressions) was so moving and telling. 

I'd see it again. 

My favorite part (and there were a few) was the ""The Other Side"" with Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron. One of my favorite dancing parts.",7l6grk
drk2j9q,"It's a fun, feel-good movie if you don't think about it too much and don't expect it to be historically accurate. We all need that sort of movie every once in awhile! I enjoyed it and don't regret seeing it. ",7l6grk
drjyup4,"It works as a fun family movie for the Holidays. Yes I would love to see an actual period drama based around how bad of a dude he actually was too, but let’s not bash this film because it never was going to be that in the first place. ",7l6grk
drmg1qy,"Enjoyed this a lot more than I expected to going into it. The costuming and set design were incredible, and Jackman gave a great performance. Even so, I found Zac Efron and Zendaya's scenes to be the most compelling.

I'm definitely going to look into P.T. Barnum more now, because I know that the story they told wasn't incredibly accurate.",7l6grk
drlm0nc,"Sounds like I'm in the minority, but I really enjoyed this movie. Hugh Jackman is great as always, and the songs were very enjoyable. The story wasn't completely predictable and even though it was his first feature, the director showed he has a great visual style, the movie looked fantastic! I'll always be one to support original musicals, I won't let that genre die!",7l6grk

drk7zrq,"That was the cheesiest movie I’ve seen all year and I loved it. The extravagant musical numbers were fun, and I appreciated the creative camerawork and choreography. Yes, the script was terrible, but the acting was on point and everyone was unwavering in their commitment. That’s impressive in itself. This feels like a Broadway production that doesn’t translate well to screen, except it was made into a movie first. I think they knew what they were making. If the music is up your alley and you don’t mind that it COMPLETELY shits on history, you’ll have fun.",7l6grk
drjyed3,"I'm probably the perfect audience for this film because I love Hugh Jackman, love musicals, and don't give a shit about PT Barnum or know anything about him.

I loved the movie. Thoroughly enjoyed myself throughout. I liked the songs, thought the choreography was great, and enjoyed the fluff themes of family/acceptance/whatever.

It's a musical and a far from perfect one. It's not a biopic. I don't know why people are treating it like some kind of propaganda film to drum up support for Barnum or his now-defunct circus. You people need to lighten up and let Hugh dance.",7l6grk

I know it's not historically accurate, but I just pretended it was about Hugh Jackman himself in a past life.",7l6grk
drs9ogt,"Who cares if it wasn't historically accurate?! It was a fun time!! He obviously was trying to make money off of these outcasts when he's stretching the truth with them. But you gotta take it for what it is, a fun musical. At least I have a new soundtrack to sing to in the shower! That opening number from Hugh was on point. ""Ladies and gents this is the moment you waited for"" how can you not have a good time with that?
Also was a nice break from all the star wars brouhaha. ",7l6grk
drysv7n,"Went it worried I wouldn't like it because the music felt too ""modern"". Turned out there wasn't a single song I didn't enjoy. Picked up the soundtrack on the way home. Might go back and see it again with friends, time permitting. 

Solidly enjoyable film. 

And I don't even care if its not ""historically accurate"". Its a musical...not a biopic. 

Also the Bartender in the ""Other Side"" number was amazing.",7l6grk

drjw6te,"I loved the scene where PT Barnum bought an elderly slave, toured her around the northeast claiming she was 160 and helped deliver George Washington as a baby, filled her up with liquor, and when she died, sold her to a surgeon so he could perform her live autopsy on Broadway.",7l6grk
drpg4iv,"How much of the hate for this is because it is not the most historically accurate vs it being a bad movie? I mean, its a musical, they aren't exactly known for being historically accurate.",7l6grk
drr5tcp,"Wow, I'm happy so many people enjoyed it!

I can't count myself among you but good for you all. I thought it was just a far more expensive Disney Channel Original Movie with all the lame and predictable ups and ""downs"". I didn't feel any risk or anticipation because it's hellbent on being feel-good instead of being interesting. If you're going to lie, make it interesting. 

I did enjoy the visual choices and the songs Never Enough and Other Side.",7l6grk
drkpedd,Saw it last night....Its the most fair movie I have ever seen. Stuff just happens without consequence. Someone almost dies? They are fine the next scene. I lost all my money? Now I have money! My wife hates me? Not any more! It felt less like a story and more like Shakespeare in love for a topic you are not familiar with at all. The movie was a 65 it passes. There was moving pictures on screen and  you can tell a lot went into this movie but that is about it. The music is very forgettable. The acting is good but not amazing. The story is good but just lightly explores the world without going too deep into anything. Everyones accents are all over the place and that is really it.       ,7l6grk
drtvyht,"This was a fun movie.  Critics seemed like they wanted a historically-accurate representation of Barnum's past, which it is not.  But if you want a fun movie that follows history loosely filled with incredible, spine-tingling singers, then this is for you.",7l6grk
ds8k6c0,"I loved this movie. The choreography and songs were amazing. The bar scene with Zac and Jackman was fantastic, with the bartender included.

My only complaint is that the movie went from Jackman being poor to being super rich in the span of 5 minutes.",7l6grk
drndsy9,My boyfriend said I was literally smiling the entire time. That movie was magical as fuck! Who gives a damn if PT was really a shitty person. It was a great movie Idc what anyone says ,7l6grk
dsda1yu,"It's just so big and bright and.. And... Happy. I just smiled the whole movie, I even teared up in parts. 

I know it's not true to life and didn't even have time to bag on the movie for having modern music in a movie set in the 1800's because the opening number was just so impressive. 

It kinda clicked for me that this was a representation of how the circus felt for people of the time: the wonder, the spectacle and the largeness of it. I didn't even care that it wasn't true to history, I just had a hell of a good time.

I wish they'd tour this live. The music is so good, and it's totally not my normal listening style. While I was walking my dog I was listening to the soundtrack and choking up, it's just that powerful. 

Such talent on screen and off, I can't believe people are hating on it, but different strokes for different folks. 

Maybe at a different point in my life, I'd have felt differently about it, but at this juncture if I'm going to the movies, I want to be entertained. I usually wait for serious movies to come to streaming before I watch them, *if* I watch them anymore. 

Not that this was a silly movie, it just didn't have an agenda or a major societal message. Just the ""follow your dreams/heart/etc"" one we grew up with via Disney movies.",7l6grk

ds66xam,"As someone who enjoys depressing tv and films, and someone who isnt really into musicals, all's I can is say is that it was nice to watch a film with a simple, happy plot, with goddamn catchy songs. It made me happy, and I really enjoyed it.",7l6grk
drks46c,"I’m going into The Greatest Showman pretending it’s an original musical film rather than a whitewashed biopic about a    vile human being so I can enjoy prime Hugh Jackman singing and dancing without guilt.

drp68ob,"Just watched the movie and I think it was enchanting. 

I loved the starting scene, the build up to the explosion to the transition to reality was absolutely beautiful. And the other scene where they showed the love story of Barnum and Charity, though I'm salty they didnt show how exactly their love for each other grew.

I loved how they synced the beat of the songs to the choreography. 

But, I felt like they took the concept of ""transitioning through time"" a little too much. We were never really shown growth. Just the start of something to the end of something. There wasnt much character development or plot. Alot of storyline potential was wasted. Though if they did choose to build on every storyline, the movie would be hourss long.

Overall it's a good movie to just enjoy. I'd give it a 6.5/10",7l6grk
drqrm2n,"This film blew my expectations away!! Really enjoyed every bit of it. What a great way to end 2017's film run.

The cast was just amazing. Just like how I was surprised by Vanessa Hudgens on Grease, Zac Efron nailed it in this one. It's phenomenal watching how far those 2 have come from their HSM days when I was a kid.

The music, oh gosh, some of the best songs I've heard in a musical. I can see this film being turned into a Broadway musical someday. It just has to. Choreography was amazing as well. Spotted Jeremy Hudson, one of my fave dancers, as part of the circus ensemble.

And Funko, get to work on those Greatest Showman Pops!!",7l6grk

drjzxp8,"Can any musical theatre and/or music nerd in here comment on musical aspects of the film? How pitch corrected are the singers, did the lyricists manage anything more interesting than their work on La La Land/Dear Evan Hansen, is the music any good/at all interesting, etc.?",7l6grk
dtfxlj2,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of cheesy, campy movies AND musicals. I grew up with Phantom and Les Mis blasting in the car instead of the Top 20 station. 

This film is fantastic and is a love letter to many things: artistry, dreamers, the entrepreneurial spirit, loyalty, perseverance...and I think it speaks volumes that the chief complaint among most critics is that it isn’t historically accurate or omits all the negative aspects of Barnum’s life. Isn’t that one of the “lessons” of the film? To look past the negative in favor of a more beautiful, imaginative story? 

Understandably, the REAL Barnum did questionable and abhorrent things. By all accounts he wasn’t Jackman’s Barnum. In this flashy, glitzy story EVERYTHING is heightened and put in a positive light, and Barnum’s story gets the same treatment. This isn’t meant to be a biopic or a historical retelling; this is a work of fiction done impressively well. 

I left the theatre trying to think of something I didn’t like about the film but came up short. The choreography/dancing was top notch; the “The Other Side” scene with the bartender and Jackman/Effron is right up there with “Good Morning” from “Singin’ In The Rain” (yeah I said it!). The music was expertly crafted and performed and stirs something in my soul; the storytelling was imaginative and perfectly timed. 

Not every film/script has to be convoluted and complex; this film hit every high note with a flourish and I’m glad I saw it on the big screen. ",7l6grk
drk1fe5,"When I first heard about this film very early into production, I was stoked.  I ""thought"" we were finally getting an epic film profiling the life and death of the circus, from its humble beginnings with PT Barnum's Traveling Museum, his partnership with James Bailey, and the eventual acquisition by Ringling Bros. creating the famed ""Ringling Bros. Barnum & Bailey Circus"" we all know.

Nope.....instead we got an inner beauty musical using PT Barnum's Traveling Museum as a template.  

I know this may upset a lot of people, I just think the story of the circus is a great one, and had immense potential.  I would LOVE to see a Netflix series possibly some day, one can dream...",7l6grk
drk1lke,"Ignoring the extreme inaccuracy about P.T Barnum's life, its a lukewarm musical. You get the premise from the trailer and the songs are the cliche pop music you'd expect. I wouldn't recommend watching unless you're that huge of a Hugh Jackman fan.",7l6grk
drkde1b,"Warning this is very annoyingly long;

Personally, I enjoyed the film. Many will obviously disagree with me, but I found it ""spectacular"" in it's own unique way. Gracey (yes, people weren't a fan.) For at least me, did a very interesting way of capturing the entire film, which I adored, as it actually felt like I was in the audience of an actual circus. So that being said, I was not bothered by his first film debut, which some are obvious not fans of.

The second thing I'd like to mention is, the cast was all wonderful, the chemistry between everyone and the positive energy coming off Hugh is crazy, you can see the cast strongly feeding off it, and it strongly balances, that being said, because of how involved everyone's is in the film, none of the actors for me stood out, they were all equally great. I actually loved all of Rebecca's scenes as well, originally I had no idea who she is, yet she was great.

Now, my problem with the film... Is the fact that it was way too short, and due to that, it was a punch to the face to the plot line. The entire time, it felt like SNL skits, you'd do one skit, then you're right to the next. The plot was there, but it was so paper thin and due to the overly fast pace of the film, the plot suffered. Which is real upsetting, because if they had the film by far longer (not PG 13 to impress all audiences), they could've easily went into depth for everyone and everything, which would've made the film beyond incredible. But, they striked out, unfortunately. I really wished they hired better script writers.

Lastly, I wish they focused on making Barnum evil, there was moments were he was continuously being called out, but, it was later forgotten once again because the movie was too fast paced so there was no time to explore and every character would forget. 
If they had made him more and more evil and ended him being evil, it truly would've been an entertaining bigger plot twist.

PT Barnum is like the Jordan Belfort of the age. One of the up to no good corrupted con artists.. Wolf of Wall Street is an example of a film that went from showcasing a character (Jordan) early life being all struggles (like Barnums), then, trailing off slowly and slowly to riches and a good life, to it all collapsing for him. Barnum & Belfort may have done completely different things in life, but these two people easily connect. There was so many moments in the film that reminded me of Wolf of Wall Street (Jordan's character) in the sense that they could've written this character beyond captivating with loads of issues they could feed off which would've bring beautiful character development, but the script writers did not even THINK of going this route when they SHOULD'VE. Even Michelle's character could've been like Belfort's first wife in Wolf of Wall Street that stuck with him, but, then replaced with his affair with Jenny Lind (aka, the ""Margot Robbie"" scenario) which would've ended the same way showcasing strong depth, but they didn't even think of that. (Yes, I am comparing two different genres of film with two different plots, I know I'm stupid for saying that, but I'm solely talking about the way they could've written PT Barnum.)

Regardless, the film does have it's issues, I believe those few main ones is where it all collapsed. If it wasn't fast paced, better script writers, a couple reshoots & a Barnum evil plot twist, I honestly believe then it would've been critically appraised. The all audience PG 13 is what also cut back on what they could do, therefore they left behind the history and interesting parts of Barnum just so they could rake in the cheesiness and simply appeal to all audiences who had no idea of Barnum's backstory.

Regardless, for some odd reason I loved the film. It was not only adoringly cheesy, but comforting and I did loved the directing style of it, because it was something fresh to the table I haven't seen in awhile. Most Hollywood films are always the same directing wise and trying to capture what another director has already done (example, Zac Synder trying to replicate Nolan's films) ... Gracey bought something else (fresh...) we've haven't seen before, which I adored. 2017 has strongly been filled with dark sad depressing films, this one is the opposite you just want to hop out your seat and dance and have a drink and grab people around you and burst into a choreography with them.

People are taking it way too seriously and strongly overthinking it. Some people seem to be pretty aggressive due to it not capturing all history of Barnum, but what do you expect solely for a musical? Since when are musicals realistic? Never. That's what everyone is forgetting which is lol. Why don't we all beat Scar up from the Lion King now, because there's no such thing as a singing mean lion with green eyes and a black mane & beard. 
Think about it. Musicals were always suppose to be beyond unrealistic, they take away the bore from regular society and give us the butterflies in our stomach and overwhelm us with positive vibes that makes us want to dance and sing, THAT is what a musical IS suppose to do, this FILM did that which the critics forget and won't overlook, because they can't get over the lack of history and it's other big flaws.

I've never seen a theater clap before too, which I found even more adorable. It was a well-done film, the only issues was the script writers, I really wish they had better script writers THAT was their DOWNFALL.",7l6grk
drobjiq,"I think we can all agree that PT Barnum was not the best of people. Plenty of 19th century businessman weren't. Neither was Alexander Hamilton or any other old time people that were worship or sensationalize, by today's standards.

Point is, during the movie I was bothered by a lot of this, especially with a lot of the historical inaccuracies when it comes to the music. About halfway through I realized that this is just a fun movie, it's got a great message, and all of it was just inspired by the story of PT Barnum.

It's not meant to be a documentary or historically accurate. It's meant to tell a story and to be enjoyed. So do that. Enjoy it.",7l6grk

ds379r1,"Unpopular opinion, but I just want to offer my two cents:
Catching The Greatest Showman in the theatres was kinda a spontaneous last-minute thing for me. I saw a trailer and thought it was gonna be a typical cheesy, feel good musical kinda thing (not a bad thing, I love cheesy stuff).

I knew nothing about P.T Barnum going into the movie, but while watching it I can’t help but feel that there’s more dimensions to his character than just what’s portrayed in the musical, which was proven right after I read up on his story online afterwards.

However, I do understand that it’s a movie so we can’t expect all parts of his life events/highlights/character to be incorporated, but I was particularly disappointed with certain scenes.

For example, when Barnum decided to host a tour for Jenny Lind, the group of freaks came by to grace the event and yet Barnum shut them out in order to protect his own image and fit in with the social elites I suppose.

Suddenly fast forward a few scenes, the gang was singing and dancing at the bar with Barnum and all’s well again? Since this is a PG rated movie, I wonder what message will the younger audience take with them when they leave the theatre? I do feel this is a key issue that ought to be addressed.

As for the romance between Philip and Anne, I felt that the subplot was severely undeveloped. One moment he holds her hand, the next, she was berated by her parents, when the circus fire broke out she was seen with another guy (forgot his name) and suddenly they are together again? It was a little confusing for me and my date to watch. Overall, I do think they have great chemistry and I enjoyed their scenes. 

I would say it’s a pretty ok movie. The singing and dancing does get me hyped and I do enjoyed the movie as a whole. Perhaps if you just watched it without reading too much into it as I did, you would have a better experience. 

Rating: 3/5 ",7l6grk
dsd33yn,"Watched it yesterday with my girlfriend because we'd missed the time for the movie we'd originally wanted to watch. Walked in with zero idea of what the movie was about, no previous trailers, nothing.



TOTALLY WORTH IT. We were basically tapdancing out of the cinema when the movie was over.

Star Wars? That movie legitimately pissed me off. Thor? More Disney copy paste tripe. The Greatest Showman, for all its flaws (most of which are tied to the short runtime causing a rush for the plot), made me genuinely smile. This movie spoke to me, not because of ""This is Me"" which is supposed to be some kind of outcast anthem (my least favorite piece in the movie), but because of the song ""A Million Dreams"" which resonated with me, since I literally struggle to sleep every night because of all the things I want to make running through my head. If you are a creator of any kind, you know how I feel. 

With as much garbage as we have been getting from Hollywood lately, and with all the money going to Disney, who I am beginning to like less and less, I think we needed a movie like this one.

If any of you are interested, I calculated the amount of booze Barnum and Carlyle drank during the”Other Side” scene, because I have watched this movie way too much and noticed they were drinking a LOT. But in a good way. Like, I going to follow their example and get drunk in song form from here on out.

The shots in the scene weren’t always full, but I assume that was so the actors wouldn’t have to gulp large shots during the scene. Assuming they were real shots, here’s how many they each had and what their BAC would be for drinking that much hard liquor in under an hour:

Carlyle: 10 shots (0.22% BAC)

Barnum: 7 shots  (0.15% BAC)

Essentially they each drank a pint of whiskey in a 4 minute period.

dusbc4n,"I really enjoyed this movie, it wasn't a masterpiece but it was fun and I had a great time seeing it in theaters. I can be a stickler for historical accuracy (woo history major) but I kind of appreciate how much they changed Barnum. Like... They really went all out in making someone who was by all accounts an opportunistic capitalist into a genuine, good man. I appreciate how much they committed to their inaccuracy if that makes sense. I found it easier to suspend my disbelief because as far as I could tell, the only thing both Barnum's shared was their name. It committed to being a kid friendly, feel good musical with a historical setting rather than a true historical piece and I can respect that. 

And while I think they didn't spent enough time fleshing out some parts (I wish there had been more of Philip and Anne's romance and more with the freaks) it was a sweet and fun movie nonetheless. And I loved the aesthetic, with the balance of historical and obscenely colorful.

dru8oq0,"I really wanted to like this film. I'm a huge fan of Jackman and his gorgeous tenor voice, and La La Land is my favorite movie literally of all time, but I now see the magic of La La Land wasn't due to the lyrics. 

Putting aside the historical fiction aspect of it, this movie overall fell flat to me. The music felt like stand-in pop songs rather than big Broadway show tunes that help move the story along. Overall, the whole movie felt very closed off and not very grandiose.

It had its moments, for sure. The trapeze scene with Zac and Zendaya was gorgeous, and the camera work was well done in most places.

The biggest thing I couldn't look past was the shameless CGI and just overall how manufactured it looked. This, I would assume, was the style they were going for, but it felt all too polished and real for a story about outcasts.

Also, a small nitpick: the audio on their speaking voices felt weirdly ADR'ed. Their singing was all very well done, but I suspect a heavy amount of post processing work was done there as well.

This isn't a movie I think I'd see again. It doesn't have the rewatchability of a movie musical like Les Mis or even Into The Woods, in my opinion.

dvu0z0u,">On a scale of 1-10 how would you rate the film The Greatest Showman?

>Mean = 8.03

>Median = 8

>Mode = 10

>σ = 2.03

I'm surprised that the movie did this well on a Reddit community poll. And I'm someone who considers the movie in a favorable light. I gave it a 7/10 (good, not great) and wasn't expecting to see it hit an 8 for Mean and Median, and 10 for mode.

I generally liked it and was glad to have gone see it. But with all the controversy over the historical revisionism of P.T. Barnum and accusations of the movie's songs being a bit on the bland/uninspired (it's true, there are better musicals out there with better songs), it's still a little surprising.

I'm glad some people really enjoyed it and hopefully Hugh Jackman knows that. I get what the critics have an issue with when they say that P.T. Barnum was probably not the most deserving person to have a musical made after them. At the same time, I think no-one was honestly expecting this to be a faithful biographical recount of Barnum's life. That certainly wasn't the expectation I had going in, and I only saw the trailers, I didn't do much reading into the real-life Barnum until after I saw the movie.

I saw an interesting suggestion in a comment thread here on Reddit (not sure if it was this megathread) where someone suggested they should have ditched the ""based on a true story/real person"" fictionalized biography gimmick and just made up a story about a man who gets fame and glory from creating a circus for the ""outcasts"" of society, maybe with some inspirations from real-life but nothing explicitly based on a single person like P.T. Barnum. That probably would have been a better to approach the creation of this film, from a narrative-construction and story-telling point of view.

This being said, I'm trying not to hold it against the movie too much because it's clearly stylized. Though it seems like such an easy fix, if they had just called the main character ""B.T. Farnum"" or something like that, then all the criticisms of the accuracy of the story go away and it would have freed up some creative potential. I think most people who liked it, didn't really give a shit that it was about P.T. Barnum, they liked the ensemble of characters, and the themes and arc of the story.

My negative digs at this movie:

* Odd pacing, but it's a musical where all the big plot points have to happen in 5-minute song and choreographed dance performances, so I guess that kind of comes with the genre.

* It's short. I guess it didn't bother me that much, the story didn't feel like it was dragging on but at the same time you sort of get to the end and go ""Oh... that's it? Ok then.""

* Would have liked a bit more of a real down-turn for the Barnum character. There's moments in the movie where his character is at a low point, but (and maybe this is also an issue with lighting and the stage set), they they never really *felt* like it. I know it's not meant to be a dour film but I would have liked a little more sadness or despair(?) to even out the happy, peppy, high points. And Jackman can do it, it's just that the script and the way it was shot didn't really seem to emphasize the point, they just briefly dwell on it and then quickly move on.

* Would have liked better development of the ensemble cast of characters. At least one song for every one of the main ones. The film is a little bit lop-sided in this regard.

* Passage of time, maybe? It felt a little bit weird that it appears the main events of the movie take place in about a year, with no discernible passage of time. His daughters are roughly the same age as when he began the circus, as when he ""retires"" from it and passes the baton to Philip.",7l6grk
dwudr2t,"Well I have seen this 82 times at the cinema. I have spoken to people of all ages who have absolutely loved it. Most go more than once and it is still selling out our cineplex after 3 1/2 months. I literally sat in a full cinema only yesterday. Okay so I get it The Real Barnum and his practices would now not be acceptable  because we have moved on and times have changed and we have learnt from his mistakes.  ( hence them using animatronic elephants and special effects) . But if you watch this film for what it is I fail to see how you can’t come out feeling better than when you went in. The songs are so uplifting, the story moves at a pace. I have to say when I went to my first screening we were given questionnaires from the movie studio/ producers  and we had to fill in before and after. Questions like “ how much did high Hackman impact on you choosing this film?”  My scores were so low , I hadn’t watched anything with Hugh in, didn’t rate Zac that much and did not think I liked Michelle Williams oh and Zendaya who??? , I saw the original Barnum stage show as a child and thought why are they redoing something that was so good ?   But boy was I wrong ! It finished and my mum and I just looked at each other and went “WOW” . The second set of answers were very different. ! 
We returned the next night and the rest is history. 82 showings , 2 singalongs ( another booked ) in full costume . 2 showings in IMAX. And I can’t believe I still get to sit in a cinema and see this amazing film. And before anyone tells me to get a life , I do have one but also dealing with a lot sadness at the minute and this is an hour and a half every day where I can just be transported to pure HAPPY !!!

ds44sls,"I'll start off with the negatives. The movie was slightly choppy in the middle. In my mind, the pitch for the movie or the picture in the director's head was ""we're going to have an amazing beginning showcasing the circus, then a romantic song showcasing the love story, then Hugh does a riveting pitch to Zac Efron, then something something in the middle, then BLAM a big finale."" I really felt they lost the pacing in the middle of the movie with some direction going astray. Secondly, the movie didn't touch the social aspects *enough* in my opinion. The 1800s are an age that is not shown in movies too often from my point of view; most of the movies nowadays are about the 1900s or the current century. The 1800s was a fascinating age with an even greater social dynamic than I felt from the movie. Maybe that's related to the pacing of the story. Finally, I am a little infuriated by how often they cut to Zendaya during the circus performances. I have no issues with Zendaya and I find her enjoyable, but, come on, 1) she can't be the *only* person you cut to during the group performance and 2) you can't cut to her *every 10 seconds*. Really now... the performance would've been so much better if they showcased everybody during the group performance.

Now the positives, the music is absolutely beautiful. I'm gushing to be honest. ""A Million Dreams"" is a movie in and of itself that I could watch for ages. The choreography throughout the movie is astounding and fantastic. I'm shocked by the lack of stunt doubles used, notably with Zac Efron and Zendaya. Those shots really paid off. In the end, I got what I paid for: ENTERTAINMENT. I was entertained. Really, for this type of movie, what more could I ask for than to walk away smiling.

After seeing the movie i was VERY satisfied and this is one of the few movies of the year that i actually went to social media to recommend to others. I can say honestly that the music and performances made it for me. Yes the plot was garbage, and very predictable (i'll get into it later) but the songs were powerful, moving and overall very catchy. No they didn't do a good job with the empowerment message and we can all nitpick about the deeper meanings but from a pure entertainment + a small bit of plot standpoint, i loved it.

Small issues/praises for the plot:

I loved how the whole childhood and beginning of the film for Barnum's life was done in one song. Honestly, no one really wanted to see a young boy struggle and i feel the main point of the movie was his adult/circus life so i felt this was a very good choice in the part of the writers.

The romance/whatever you want to call it with Jenny Lind. I feel like the second we saw her mysterious back in front of the Queen, it was a matter of when before Barnum ""cheats"" with her. I honestly feel that this movie, didn't need that dramatic twist and could have easily moved in the director where PT dumps her because she's coming on too strong and cancels the show leading to of course taking on a lot of debt and having to start over. Which is exactly what happened albeit through the fire. Maybe i don't know the history and this actually happened but i feel like if it was all fiction, the writters could have gone with this route instead of the one depicted with the forced kiss and ""breakup"". It was a huge cringe/facepalm moment when i saw the kiss on stage as i'm sure i'm not the only one that saw it coming after the camera panned to Barnum with Lind's open hand inviting him on stage.

Last little issue i had was just all of the little tiny things that were meant to lead the audience to hate Barnum throughout the middle of the film with the slamming of the door being the pinnacle. Again, i'm not sure what happened in ""real life"" but i feel like the writers could have gone a different route without all the drama and the movie would still be just as watchable as it is now. All the little things that come to mind are.. giving instructions to Zac without saying bye to the crew, not performing with them, etc etc, I can't recall all the others

All in all, i loved the film, don't let the little issues i had fool you. I've actually watched it twice now, and that's a very rare thing for me to do so great movie, even better soundtrack!",7l6grk
drvvpbj,"I don't get why people are negative about this... 

Every song in this movie is amazing. Sometimes its a bit too modern for my tastes both in the music and in the lyrics ( ""You know I want you..."", seems straight out of modern pop, which is not my personal preference), but every song wins me over anyway. 

The dancing is very impressive to this untrained eye.

The movie struck me as a good modernization of the old style musical movies, which my parents used to put on when I was younger (""Singing in the rain"", ""The Sound of Music"", ""Calamity Jane"", etc). It's a genre I miss, and I hope this movie signals its return.

** MILD SPOILERS below ***
Story wise I was happy. Maybe I'm simple, but I liked the simple ""Don't lose track of what's actually important"" plot.

The most bizarre thing of the whole movie was the circus performers doing Michael Jackson-like choreography. Not that it was a bad  thing but it made other choreographed scenes seem bland in comparison. If they had kept that energy throughout the whole movie it would have been a better film for me.",7l6grk

For two hours it felt like I was in a completely different world. I can't remember last time when a movie  had this type of effect on me when I had to hold back tears on several occasions. And the message it sends it simply beautiful - that we should always celebrate diversity and our differences; things that make life so worth living.

dto432w,"Good movie. I don't care that people think it's historically inaccurate. I love musicals, but the most obvious problem to me of the movie is the music. Each song sounded the exact same. Slow build, rising chorus, ends with a slow outro. 

I loved La La Land enough to the point where I saw it 4 times in theaters. It's easily in my top ten favorite movies ever. The musical numbers in it were top notch.

Each of the songs in Greatest Showman felt like a Katy Perry ""anthem"" made to sell the soundtrack. I'm seeing a lot of people here loved the music, and that's fine. I was just hoping for more music like in La La Land, not like on top 40 radio.",7l6grk

dselhzy,"The music is truly just amazing. If you listen to the soundtrack all the way through, it's a spectacular movie. But doing that leaves out the part where the plot was all over the place and the conclusion needed about another half hour. 

I'm just really against the idea of going from having everything in your world taken away from you throughout the course of the movie, and then it's all solved by one song. It is really a great song, but just such a poor ending to what had everything in place to be a great movie.

Now, here's my resoning for the movie being all over the place 

You have Barnum and his relationship with his wife and family. You have all the people in the circus. You have Barnum's rushed relationship with Zach Efron (that again, is pretty much covered in one song). Then there is Efron and Zendaya. Barnum and the Swedish goddes with maybe the best song I've ever heard. 

The peices were there, they just didn't execute. Pretty much every scene was great, some of them just had no business being in the movie because it creates so many mixed messages.

Lastly I can not stress enough how great of a song ""Never Enough"" is. Wow...remarkable!",7l6grk

drvb5io,"Something weird happened while watching “The Greatest Showman.” Every time I wrote a mark against it for its one-dimensional characters and rather unlikeliness of P.T Barnum, the film personified itself, sat next to me, and said, 

“Honey shush. We know you’re a little bitch for musical movies.”

“Yeah but—“

“Shush. You came here to have a good time. And that is what we’re going to do. We’re going to have a good time.”

“I’m trying to have a good time but can you add a little complexity to your story instead of breezing through key points of this man’s life as if they meant nothing. I can’t really dig this film that much unless you do so.”

“Oh yeah. If you can’t dig the movie, then why are your feet tapping and your head bopping?”

“Because I’m a bitch for musicals.”

“Exactly. BYEEEEE!”

dsr4y4p,"If you are saying you weren’t moved during ‘This is Me’ and ‘From Now On,’ you are lying. 
This movie was INSPIRED by PT Barnum. Not a historically accurate bio pic. The people complaining about historical accuracies... I don’t think PT sang his way through his life.
This was a beautiful movie with stunning sets, costumes and music. 
It had a MESSAGE that doesn’t happen a lot now. ",7l6grk

dt2n7v8,"My thoughts (EDIT: DIDN'T REALIZE HOW LONG THIS WAS! TL:DR I liked it, it was good):

Discounting the fact that the story was absolutely cleaned up and glamorized in an irresponsible way I really, really enjoyed this movie way more than I thought. I loved the music, it seemed more a blend of pop and traditional musical-style than just ""generic pop"" like many people are saying. I also love anachronistic music choices like this (for example liked the music in Gatsby). The songs were catchy, but with enough complexity (in my opinion) that I haven't gotten bored of them. Never Enough in particular was great because it highlighted Barnum's main character flaw and connected him to Jenny Lind. Both are characters who are ambitious and want validation, and they just keep going after their ambitions instead of being happy for what they achieve. One thing I enjoyed that many people seemed not to was that most of the plot was played out during the songs by the lyrics and actions as opposed to dialogue. This makes the non-singing part seem like the pacing was bad but I thought the songs gave us enough cues to understand how the story was unfolding (that's just my take, I can see the other side too though).

I also loved the parallel of Jenny's big spectacle of a song about stealing the stars and chasing grand dreams and Charity's simple (but still beautiful) tune about going along for the ride and being their for him. I also love Jenny's short reprise song, where she never says ""for me"" because she realizes that Barnum doesn't feel the same way about her that she does for him, she's not enough for him because nothing is right now. Charity says nothing is enough for him, she's not even mad about the kiss, she knows he doesn't love Jenny and I loved that part as well. Both ladies point out how careless he's been with people, which is great segue into the main conflict - how he treats his troupe. 

The performers get a neat arch of thinking he is their ""salvation"" but in the end they're family whether he's a part of it or not. He ends up leaving to be with his own family, and they still have their own. I thought that was a really interesting ending. I felt the songs ""This Is Me"" and ""From Now On"" explained most of this arch. I understand people thought these characters needed more development and screen time but I felt like the title indicated this was Barnum's story, not the performers. It could have been called The Greatest Show but they chose to call it The Greatest Showman. 

I thought the Phillip/Anne subplot was cute, I wanted them to be together. I wasn't super invested in them but they had some really great chemistry and their duet was gorgeous to watch. I also got teary when she was singing their song to him in the hospital, so I did care about them to some degree.

Barnum and Phillip as (sort of) master and apprentice was cool too, because Barnum had to fight for this big thing he's made and Phillip was born into wealth and privilege and yet they don't play the ""he's rich and from a good family so he's a dick"" card for too long, which I'm thankful for. I also just really enjoy both of these actors and they're choreography and chemistry was so fun to watch.

I also liked that there wasn't one clean ""bad guy"", there were assholes but this was a man vs. himself kind of conflict.

Overall it made me so happy, and also hurt in the right places, I wanted the (fictional) Barnum to succeed in the right way - not just with the circus success. Which i felt was one of the messages. I also loved the big spectacle, it made me feel like this was probably how people saw the circus back then - this big, imaginative, entertaining show. I commend them for taking a lot of risks and trying things, even if they didn't always work out. I'm really glad I saw this movie. I understand why people wish they didn't use Barnum's name, but as a movie I thought it was awesome and one of the few real family movies that have come out recently because I (younger) took my BF (older) and his kids (10 & 8) and we all found something to enjoy about it despite the age differences.

dt38akv,Really enjoyed this film. I really think the critics are unfairly judging it. Would suggest this to anyone. Very entertaining and overall just a good time at the theater. I made a [video review](https://youtu.be/7tZxHlMbEF8) of the film if anyone is interested!,7l6grk
drohele,"Incredibly fun movie, went right in hoping for a show and got exactly what I hoped for. I don't think this was marketed as the true story of PT Barnum, hopefully on a re-watch people can get past the glossing over of his darker elements and have fun with this [a la the movie's critic character.](#spoiler)",7l6grk
ds3hklp,"There were a few plot holes here and there causing the movie to lack substance, somewhat. Characters were underdeveloped and the plot felt messy. They definitely could have emphasised more on efron and zendaya and the circus cast as there was no mention of them training for the show or any scene of them bonding, cultivating a ""family"" in the circus. However the cinematography and songs made up for it, thankfully. Some scenes such as those in the circus tent and in the bar when efron and jackman were taking shots looked fantastic. Songs on the other hand sounded less broadway style and more modern pop, which is fine but definitely wasn't what I expected, going into the movie thinking it would be a musical, broadway style. ",7l6grk
dtnjkis,"I know I'm way late to this but to the people trying to compare this to Hamilton they are ENTIRELY different musicals. The modernised music was for a very specific reason, Hamilton was made more empathetic sure but he is never not shown as a deeply flawed character and one of the major themes of the musical is that this is only one version of all the characters you see. I enjoyed this movie for what it was but Hamilton is LEAGUES above it",7l6grk
dvq441m,"The film in of itself is wonderful, great acting, great soundtrack, but the story... I've envisioned for a few years now someone like Netflix or Hulu making a series based on the rise and fall of the circus.  And not the sugar coated tale we got with ""The Greatest Showman"" highlighting only the start and nullifying the rest, but the raw truth and power of the circus, start to finish.  The early days of PT Barnum's traveling museum, his retirement, the acquisition by Ringling Bros. thus giving birth to ""Ringling Bros. Barnum & Bailey Circus"".  I think its a story that still needs to be told.  Would make for one hell of a mini series.  ",7l6grk

Was surprised that this was about a real life guy (never heard of P.T Barnum before - again no context), I just took it to be it's own story.

dt3sbxh,"I am late but will add my review here, since this movie really gave me unforgettable unique experience.
I usually only watch movies with good ratings and deep meanings since most of the time I side with critics. I am not a big fan of human with super abilities, fast running cars, or Disney princesses. So the last three movies I watched in cinema are Arrival, Blade Runner, and La La Land, and I would say I totally understand why these movies receive praise from critics after watching them.
So I watched TGS by coincidence, as it got pretty bad rating on RT, and I heard the plot is crap...really didn't expect much.
But I was so GLAD I didn't miss such an amazing movie! I was astonished by the beauty and emotion in it. For most musicals, I find the songs not good enough, feel sleepy and hope they stop singing. But this movie is an exception. Every song is that good and takes my breath away. I do not mind the plot is shallow or cliche, come on people would suddenly jump on the table and sing songs in this movie. I really didn't expect it reflects much of our cruel reality. I see this movie as a Disney style fairytale-like musical and for this part, it is done unbelievable astonishing (in a good way).
The songs! I cannot give enough praise for it! I couldn't help to open my mouth to aww-- during the ""Not Enough"" performance. My tears actually dropped when hearing it (a little embarrassed to admit lol ), and it it not because the plot is touching or sth. English is even not my first language, so it's neither the lyrics (as for most songs, I could only get 70% of the lyrics). It is solely the magic power of music. This is the first time a song touches my heart so deep with the pure power of the music itself, which I think it is the highest praise I could give to a musical. My face must have looked as astonished as Hugh Jackman's after hearing the song.
I hope the movie did not end when the final number came in, and that rarely happens during my cinema experience.
Usually I don't recommend movies to friends since movie taste is subjective and personal, but this movie is an exception. Power of music should be universal to everyone. My friend thanked me for recommending her such a surprisingly good and emotional movie, and yes, I recommend this movie to everyone who haven't seen it.",7l6grk

Outstanding choreography and songs.",7l6grk
dsryujf,"I found it boring.

It tried so hard, but I felt no connection to it whatsoever. The songs have really obvious ADR especially when Efron is onscreen, and the singers are shot out of focus or in group shots so the average person doesn't notice their attempts to circumvent lip-synching.

Maybe it was too rushed? They went through the trouble of hiring a child actor for Barnum and discard him after 8 minutes. It hardly has a moment to let the audience catch its breath. Even in the sad parts, like when Barnum has lost everything, the circus people come in and start a song not even 5 minutes after the man's lowest moment happened.

**3/10.** The visuals were stunning and Jackman tried but... that's it. Jackman gave one of the best performances of the year in *Logan*, so it's probably just the director's fault for not making it come together.",7l6grk

>In December 2017 it was reported that James Mangold, who had worked with Jackman on several projects including 2017's Logan, had been brought in to oversee the film's reshoots and post-production. This was due to the studio's concern that Gracey was overwhelmed with the scope of the film and struggling with the pressure of an $84 million budget. 

So original director was just let go by the studio or did he just quit in the middle of the production because of the pressure?",7l6grk

Upon hearing the first song, then the second, I realized this was the case and prepared for the worst. But the songs were fine- if not especially catchy or memorable- and the sets, choreography, and casting was all quite good. I think I would've preferred more focus on the circus members' stories and experiences. Maybe 2 hours is considered too long for this type of movie, but it felt somewhat rushed to me.

drkb5r1,"If you can go in knowing that it’ll be whitewashed to hell and back (like I did), and like musicals (like I do), then there’s a good chance you’ll be willing to overlook the thin plot and characterization. Charity was basically a cardboard cutout with no personality, much less agency. You can tell that wasn’t Rebecca Ferguson’s voice. I don’t know a single character that was a “curiosity” outside of Zendaya’s Anne (and that was because she was paired with Efron’s Phillip in a weak racial storyline that attempted to be a subplot). 

However, the weird thing is that the music is good and bad. Good in that it’s catchy and uplifting. Bad in that it isn’t timeless and has limited scope. The music is something you could listen to in the current Top 40 list - not necessarily a bad thing, but it limits the potential scope of the music because its grounded in an almost singular sound that half will hate and half will like. It’s musical appeal is somewhat limited in that refard.

I love Hugh Jackman. The dude can play the manliest role ever, Wolverine, and be a top notch musical guy too. What an incredibly talented person he is. 

Who knew Michelle Williams can sing? And if her voice had some processing to it, and I’m not sure if It did or not, but Disney take note, that is how you make someone sound amazing. Michelle was incredibly beautiful in this movie as well. She has aged so well.

Just because you like actors like hugh Jackman doesn't mean you should worship everything they do. Did you people like Pan just because he was in it and it had some out of place musical numbers?

As others have said Legends of Tomorrow did a very fun Barnum episode that didn't sweep his character under the rug.

Plot wasn't overly complicated. Like some comments here, it was 'Disney-fied"". But the choreography and visuals were the best part, oh and the songs. Nice hybrid. Not exactly an adaptation of a broadway musical. Sort of like Moulin Rogue, but with original songs.

Most of the musical numbers are fantastic, expertly choreographed and creatively shot, while Hugh Jackman basically steals the entire movie whenever he has any screentime. I saw the lukewarm reviews by critics for this, and I remember a similar reaction to Into the Woods two Decembers ago and I really liked that one so I went to see this anyway.

The problems that led to my disappointment mostly came with the script and pacing. I thought the first half was really good, the gradual rise to power was fun to see unfold and I rooted for Barnum. However, it was after the bar scene with Efron and Jackman where things started to take a turn for the worst. I think the best musicals focus on a basic story built around its characters, but aside from Barnum, I couldn't care less for anyone else as they had no development whatsoever. 

The forced romance with Zendaya was terrible since it happens basically out of nowhere and her character frustratingly gets mad at Efron not once, not twice, but three times! After the bar scene, the story became so incoherent for the remainder that the flashy musical numbers weren't enough to distract me from how terrible the script was. Towards the end of the movie, problems are introduced then completely resolved in the very next scene in some cases. For example, Barnum wins over his wife again in a 30 second spiel that isn't questioned. Things move way too fast in the second half and most of the convenient solution issues could've been solved with a longer runtime so hardships or characters could be more fleshed out and meaningful.

Even the musical numbers fell flat at the end, particularly at the ending of the movie with some of the worst CGI animals I've ever seen. For a big bombastic ending, that sequence felt so cheap and flat. Also some of the songs towards the end felt like they lasted a little longer than they should've and started to get boring in the last minute of their respective sequences. This one's just a pet peeve but was there any reason for Zendaya and Efron to be jumping on each other in such a dangerous way during Rewrite the Stars?

Overall, the rating I see on the poll seems about right, a 7/10. As a movie, it starts out great and ends on a low note, but most of the musical numbers and all of Jackman is more than enough to give this a watch and you better believe I'll be listening to the soundtrack for the next several months.

drup4p1,"In the words of the movie itself, ""don't listen to them, they don't understand"". It's a statement that can be read both ways with regards to reviews about the movie. Critics pan it for not being historically accurate, fans like it for entertainment value. Every movie runs into the same pitfalls; after all, one man's meat is another man's poison.  

The best way for me to say is that this film is like a Christopher Nolan film: visually and audibly stunning with polarizing storylines. Is this a flawless story line? No, there are small issues with it, most of which I feel is down to its short run time. At 1hr 45 mins, elements of the film that had potential to be developed end up rushed, and oftentimes anticlimactic. In true Hollywood fashion, many tropes are used to bring the story to an end, an end which may feel very abrupt, which it is. If you're a student of history and feel curious enough to read up on the real events, you will also learn that the film took a lot of artistic license with the story, one of the main criticisms levelled at the film. Overall, the story may feel lacking, a lot of loose ends tied up haphazardly and rushed, with a cliche ending to boot. 

But when has a film ever just been about story? Many other elements contribute to a film and it is in these other elements that the show mainly thrives in. The music is definitely one of them. The lyricists of La La Land were involved in this film and it showed, with great songs belted out throughout the show. I do feel, like probably a lot of people, that the songs were sometimes too long and I feel that the show sacrificed a lot of development in exchange for the music. That does not detract away from the fact that about 75% of the songs are amazing, with the other 25% being decent. 

Acting was mostly on point, with Old Man Logan himself stepping into an all-too familiar role on recent times and doing a fantastic job (seriously, give this man an Oscar already). The other supporting cast was great, but my only minor (some might say major) was that [a lot of the cast was greatly underused, particularly Troy Bolton and Zendaya. Their relationship had just enough spotlight for me to root for, but I felt, like a lot of the last act, that it was rushed and anticlimactic. Given the short time to shine though, a lot of the crew really did well.] (#spoiler) 

There's a lot to praise in this film and a lot to criticise at well. I guess at the end of the day, it's a simple question we need to ask ourselves, given by our dear old Phineas T.  Barnum himself: ""When was the last time you smiled in the theatre?"" At the end of the day, I enjoyed the movie. I really, really enjoyed it. It wasn't perfect--no movie is, not even the Dark Knight, as much as people say it is--but if we judge enjoyability of a movie by whether it's perfection or not, I shudder to think how devoid of happiness that world is. You can get mad at how inaccurate it is, or how bad the music interrupts the show, or you can love the themes the movie explores and how amazing the performances are. It's on you, but for me, I liked it.

I'm fine with the modern music and CGI for the most part. Jenny's big song was horrendous, though. It sounded like an Adele impersonator doing a cover of ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"". Like....classical crossover music is kind of a big thing; they could have gone that route and even played up how it's more ""traditional"" than the music the bearded lady sang. Audiences would have reacted well to it, it would have made more sense, and like...it can still sound modern.  Besides that, holy shit but Rebecca Ferguson sucks at lip syncing.

With that being said this movie was FUCKING ATROCIOUS. A horrible jumbled plot line, auto tuned pop music trying to turn into a 2 hour musical, most of the dancing was CGI and most of the story (or what I've heard) is just simply made up. The direction was so so poor and hard to see his vision. I thought during the movie, has this person directed a film before? Turns out he hasn't. Just some music videos and a commercial with Hugh Jackman which is how he got the gig. He should stick to commercials.  I've seen around 30 movies this year in theatres. I have not seen a more restless crowd then the thaetre I was just in. I can't remember the last time I was this worked up over a movie. Just fuckin' awful. ",7l6grk
drub5ii,"The greatest compliment I can give this movie is that it was one of the quickest waste of times I've ever experienced. I remember checking my watch 2 hours into the first Bay-Turtles and it had only been 15 minutes. 

All the songs were show-stoppers (in, uh, the bad way, in the sense that they stopped everything in its tracks and were really boring), the characters were thin as can be, the script sucks. It wasn't a negative for me that the movie decided to ditch historical accuracy--sometimes making a...complex...figure a bit more palatable works, not every movie has to be serious, complicated, whatever, but surely they could have at least taken that freedom and made the movie about something instead of nothing. And not about ""learning to accept yourself"". ""This movie is about accepting others"" is some hokum that even Barnum wouldn't be able to sell. It doesn't even attempt to resolve the actual tension and conflict that the movie brings up--at no point do the sideshow characters learn anything, they don't reject Barnum for being ashamed of them too, they don't truly change the minds of the people, nothing. They burn the house down and then they rebuild and suddenly everyone loves them.

drl5nsp,"Saw The Greatest Showman last night. It is not a great movie, but the songs were fun and there was a happy tone more or less throughout. I enjoyed my time in the theater as did my friends.

The movie suffered from two things in my opinion:

* The director, Michael Gracey, is a first time director. He has some work on visual effects in the past. There clearly was a visual flair he was going for, but the tone, pacing, story-telling, and craftsmanship felt like a first time director. In the hands of a more seasoned director those flaws could have been prevented.

* In addition, we just had La La Land last year, which showed you what a great director can do with a musical. 

Overall the movie was fine. Glossy and shiny over the mans life like most bipics and flat out ignored some of the negative elements of the life of PT Barnum, but for most of the movie I was having fun. The performances were good. The Barnum kids, Zendaya, and the overall cast worked well together. I like Zac Efron, but he felt out of place in this movie.

ds4a77g,"I saw this movie skeptically and it played exactly into what made me skeptical- the entire film's plot is a delusion and, somewhat fittingly so, as that con is the only thing properly representative of PT Barnum *in the whole movie*.

In some of the positive reviews in this thread, people are saying that the film is magical and transported them to a whole other place. And that's what made this film so devastatingly bad to me. The film had that potential and they wasted it by whitewashing and glorifying a man who hurt many of the people the film purports to represent and empower.

The standout scene of the movie was ""This is Me"" and it perfectly demonstrated what the movie should have been. The story should have been about how these performers embraced who they were despite Barnum. Instead, we were given a movie that has those characters exalting the man and the film *consistently* deifies him, quickly washing every one of his problems away with a quick stroke.

I didn't leave the theatre feeling the magic, because I was too blinded by the reality of it all. And in that lies the film's problem- it never should have been about Barnum, as he wasn't the ""Greatest Showman"". He was an exploitative con man who was driven by capitalistic endeavors more than he was putting on a show. It should've just been a random person and it could've hit all of those same beats and been a good movie. The addition of the name P.T. Barnum added nothing to the film, other than to make it horrendously inaccurate and an affront to the reality.

Yes, the film had magic, but not enough to erase the truth, so they should've avoided its erasure altogether and just renamed the character. After seeing the film, my only hope is that everyone can see past the magic and understands that Barnum was not the good, wholesome man the movie made him out to be.

>The biggest issue for me (and it didn't ruin the movie) is that the subject matter is not correct. Barnum was no wide-eyed dreamer who longed to shelter and nurture the misunderstood.

The issue for the viewer is choosing whether or not to reconcile movie Barnum with real-life Barnum.  
  
I feel like they actually did highlight that a bit in the movie. He was definitely painted sympathetic, but every single person called him a fake, a hustler, only in it for the money, etc. Even his whole crew tells him ""we know you don't actually care about us and care entirely about making a buck, but you gave us a place and now you need to make this right."" There's even a whole song following him shutting his crew out after he gets more famous and breaking their hearts by saying the same bullshit he sold them on to his new act.

I saw it tonight and the theater was about 1/3 full and everyone clapped/“Yayed” at the end. The whole theater loved the movie and it was a great fictionalized version.

Hugh Jackman was an amazing actor/singer/dancer and it was the best $10 I’ve spent in a while. The opening alone made me want to get up and cheer. My only complaint is that I wish it was longer. ",7l6grk

I think it would've been better if it was completely fictionalized though, I think making it about P.T. Barnum hampered the film. They could have just made it ""inspired by the P.T. Barnum story"" and take liberties in order to not worry about historical baggage and focus on making the audience feel good.",7l6grk

MOtOE ended up being sold out and the Chinese movie ended up getting cancelled, I decided to just watch Greatest showman since we might as well get the AMC club rewards points before driving back home across town. At the beginning of the movie my brother said that if it was a bad movie then half way he would go watch disaster artist. The first 20 minutes I was pretty sure my brother was going leave because the movie wasnt good. Luckily it picked up. There were 5 other people in the theater watching but when we walked out you could see everyone was entertained and actively talking about the movie. The songs were catchy and meaningful and not throwaway trash. Awesome movie, kinda feel like watching again, this time closer to home.

The movie also focuses too much on boring melodrama and gives very little insight into how the whole circus came together.

drmwf2u,"Audience score measures how much a movie appealed to the people who saw it. People who didn't see the movie don't get a vote. So it self-selects who gets to rate it.

Whereas Rotten Tomatoes score measures how much it broadly appeals, by consensus, to a wide variety of different film critics with different tastes.

When the audience score is much higher than the critical score, it generally means one of two things: 

- ""You don't like it because it wasn't made for you""
- ""It turned off the bulk of the moviegoing public, so only the most enthusiastic fans bothered to see it""

For a musical about the circus, which got made as a passion project for a big star rather than as a studio darling, I think you're dealing with #1 here rather than #2.

And when the audience score is much lower than the critical score, that generally means either:

- ""The commercials and advertising grossly misrepresented what this movie is actually like.""
- ""This is an artsy movie that maybe should not have gotten a wide theatrical release.""

On top of this, the Rotten Tomatoes vs. Metacritic divide covers two things:

- Rotten Tomatoes values consensus more (how many critics liked it), and Metacritic values weighting more (how much critics liked it).
- Rotten Tomatoes is owned now by a movie ticket seller and its methodology inflates the ratings of big tentpole movies, especially for children and families, in order to drive business.",7l6grk

There is no time to let anything breathe, everything must happen fast fast fast.  It has the exact same plot than ""Sing"" (which would be based on the same Barnum thing), but the animated yarn made it with more pathos, there was a sense of loss.  

I´ll give an example: there is a moment when the washed linen in the roof all raise at the same time that the wife rises while dancing.  It is beautiful.  In a classic musical all the number would have been done with a couple of cuts and a continuous shot with this moment being a centerpiece, swell orchestra, start closing up on our characters.  Watch the studio and stairs scene in ""Singin' in the Rain"".  Here is just cut cut cut, swell, cut, ok cool next.

Same with the bar scene, they almost started doing it aaand.. cut cut cut.  There is a bar number in that ""Hail Caesar"" movie that was more accomplished.

They could've easily started the film (which they did...) Showcasing Barnum's early struggles, slowly, and slowly later building up like they did in Wolf of Wall Street, then introducing Michelle's character, then bring more depth with only those two for awhile, then, bring in other character's like Zac Efron's which could've been the Jonah Hill piece, then Rebecca as the Margot Robbie... Playing out that that affair, showcasing how BAD he truly is...But they didn't. IF they had went with something like this (IN the sense of a MUSICAL.) It would've showcased Barnum's REAL LIFE portrayal and would've showcased beyond captivating depth and a strong plot twist (and IF they ended it with his 'empire' all collapsing like Belfort's)

I thought that ""This is Me"" was *really* good though and I could kinda get a bit more invested after that but it really wasn't much more than a 'good' rating for me.

I get the impression that Barnum was more of a sleezy conman than the accepting and loving family man that the movie portrayed. The film touches on him using people a little bit, but it's still nowhere near an accurate representation of his character.

Some people don't go to the movies for reality though; they just want to smile and escape life for a couple of hours. Like Barnum said to that theater critic in the movie, the audience may not be looking at anything real, but their smiles are real.

I guess it's just up to the individual to take things they see in media with a grain of salt (or in the case of this movie, a big pile of salt).",7l6grk

I'd love to watch this movie as a kid so I could look past all of it's flaws because it moved right along.  I asked my 8 year old daughter why the trapeze artist couldn't be with Zach Effron and she just thought it was because she was ""different"".

Then, in the very next scene we see them in, they're holding hands, and the troubles start afterwards. I just thought to myself ""Wait, what? I guess they love each other now?""

2. I don't really get bothered by some crazy moments like that in musicals, I guess that particular move seemed a little too much for me. I was enjoying the song before that part and it took me out of the movie for a second, but the song was ending by that point anyway so maybe in hindsight, it wasn't all that bad.

Showman is far more upbeat than Lincoln, the contrast is fantastic, a somber D.D. Lewis was fantastic as always, but Jackman blew him out of the water in the singing department. 

Historically, I know next to nothing about either, but Showman and Lincoln both had amazing top-hats, therefore according to the history channel, both films have been rated in the 90-percentile of accuracy. 

While Showman may have more mainstream appeal, I would say Lincoln is the far superior movie, especially for children and pets.

Even if it was meant to be a love at first sight thing, Anne certainly didn't seem to have immediate feelings. 

I think the lyrics were weak in Jenny's song and that that whole sequence dragged on too long. The singer was talented and doing the best she could with the material. It absolutely sounds like an Adele song and has been described as such by critics, not just me.

I cannot remember any of the songs after six days and did not feel a desire to buy the soundtrack. But to each their own, some people are going to LOVE this movie and that is great.

More people go to see Barnum's hoax of a hoax, thus prompting his rival to say, ""There's a sucker born every minute.""

In the bar scene with all of the acts, the Bearded Lady briefly mentions how people say he might be doing it all to make a buck, but even that is delivered tongue and cheek.

If they actually anticipated this response, they wouldn't have the songs written to be sung by P.T. Barnum. I think simply, they just didn't care about what P.T. Barnum did to people and instead had an idea for a story they wanted to tell and I think that's a problem. Because that man doesn't fit this story and no one should think he does. If they really wanted to tell the story they wanted to, they should've left Barnum out of it, but they didn't have the foresight to do so and the story suffered because of it.",7l6grk

The greatest show set an epic tone before changing it to when he was young for the sake of contrast. Also the sheer volume and beat of the song makes it feel epic as well as being accompanied by amazing vocals from Hugh Jackman. A million dreams uses a light piano and the child voice to show an innocent and wondrous feeling as well as really engaging chorus, with a switch in the middle to show how he still feels, even after all that time. I could go on, but this is taking too long already. 

tl;dr each song has really good vocals (my personal favorites being Jackman and Michelle Williams), as well as a certain tone that makes the listener feel a certain emotion. All this accompanied by really engaging music choice that builds up with different instruments, effects and beats, to the climax, the chorus.",7l6grk

Further, audiences can differentiate between reality and Star Wars pretty easily, considering that the technology in Star Wars isn't *real*. To compare those two is apples and oranges.

I guess my main point is that if they wanted to make a fantasy movie, why not just give the main character a completely different name?

Thank you for your input. If this film existed 100% the same but did not use the name of someone who was a phenomenal piece of human shit, I would not have this issue. PT Barnum was not only just like a dude who was mean to elephants. He was unquestionably a horrible person and no part of him should be celebrated. I’m “people like me” (lol alright dude) “making a fuss about him” (fun way to phrase pointing out a historical fact) because people should know history, not Hollywood’s definition of it.

You only see this movie you think Barnum’s kind of a jerk but a hell of a showman!!!! That’s not fair. He was a conman monster. That’s what people should know.

I wish I could've seen the movie through the rose-colored glasses that you and others did, but doing so would involve ignoring the plight of those who are often overlooked too much as is and that is something that I personally cannot stand for.

Believe what you want about the movie. At its heart, it has a good message, catchy songs, and some spectacular visuals. But don't, for a second, believe that P.T. Barnum was anything like he was depicted. Don't jump through the hoop of ignoring well-chronicled evidence to think a character in a movie is true to form. Discrediting info because you didn't personally witness when it happened is ridiculous. You can believe other people. In this case, believe the litany of historians rather than the man himself.

drmyvfi,"I'm going to have to disagree with you.

You find those terms stupid, but they carry the truth that wraps around them. 

La La Land may have heart, but, that's solely because of how basic it is, it's bringing back nostalgia, which everyone is in love with... Nostalgia. The problem with nostalgia is, **we miss it**, **but we realize we don't actually need it.**

La La Land may offer you ""ambition"" but it doesn't have the unique touch what every other musical in Hollywood has given us, which is the fantasy and heart, the positive vibes surrounding you, and the need to jump out your chair and dance. Instead, it's trying to hard to replicate all of those classic films ""magical touch."" Which is why it's a bore.

Why do we need a replicate of classical musicals? That's like having Zac Synder trying to replicate all of Christopher Nolan's already done superhero films. We don't need a replicate of something we already have had.

Just because a musical is ""classical"" doesn't make it good. That is the problem with La La Land. If you watch any of classical Hollywood musicals, you'll notice they are all strongly unique, and that's what makes them beyond special (which TGS does, by the way.) La La Land, does not do that. Trying to replicate already what has been done is nothing important. The music in La La Land is not even memorable too, unlike Hollywood classics like; ""Singing In The Rain"" where you can never forget the same song for years to come and just want to jump out of your seat and sing with Gene Kelly in the rain while dancing on the sidewalk. That's what La La Land lacks, the ""magic touch"" because it has no originality, it's just Oscar-bait. Purposely done, just to win an Academy award, that has no heart
and soul. If you want to hear real orchestra, then, listen to ""Dancing in the Rain"" and watch that scene and compare it with La La Land's ""A Lovely Night"" and you'll realize how beyond generic and bore and non-magically weak La La Land is, compared to the breathtaking heart filled solo choreography Gene Kelly did.

Replicating another's work, is not needed. That's why I used the term, ""overrated/oscar bait"" because it's true.

Also, the song ""Million Dreams"" on The Greatest Showman, reminds me MORE of an ACTUAL classical Hollywood musical (despite it being POP) then ANY La La Land song offered. The orchestra and the scene revolving ""Million Dreams"" is hair raising. The song is beautiful.",7l6grk

dsbo76v,"yeah you wont see TGS on that list. It has a relatively small production budget compared to Hollywood blockbusters, and most studios don't use the entire budget, honestly I'd say they used about 50-55 million for the film, 10-15 for salaries, and the rest just went back. The film didn't have huge sprawling towns or anything, it looked just like broadway set pieces but in movie form, if anything the CGI probably inflated the costs a lot. But I predict TGS will start turning a profit at around... 130-140million box office",7l6grk

drn2eur,"See, there is your problem right there. You refuse to allow the pop genre with a musical. Since when is it wrong that pop music can be in a musical? I think that's what separates the Greatest Showman, because it is original, and the pop music stands out, and really brings out the musical side as does classical music. Which is your problem with it.

I don't hear the auto-tune in Million Dreams, like you're hearing, I hear heavier auto tune for Gosling and Stone when it comes to La La Land.

Seriously, just because it's Jazz and classical, doesn't make something better, and or ""stand out.""

Million Dreams is filled with emotion, making you want to run and dance, and captures what the characters are feeling and their stories just from it. The song is already giving you a story, without having to even see
the scenes.

Pop music is SUPPOSE to be repetitive lyric wise. All pop music is like that when it comes to the pop genre. Take Taylor Swift for example, one of the biggest lyricists out there who use to have long lyrics when it came to country, when she swapped to pop it all became repetition.
It's suppose to BE like that is the purpose of the genre, while being incredibly upbeat and catchy. That's the trade-off. None of which La La Land is memorable music wise. Usually in pop music as well, there is unique sounds that intervene with who is singing it.

That's exactly what you're missing. That IS pop it's self. If you cannot overlook the pop genre yourself, then it's understandable why you didn't like the music.

There is nothing wrong with pop in a musical too. A musical doesn't need to be classical.
That's what the critics, and many others forget.

I also believe pop actually did work despite the timezone, it was different, and a standout. We already have hundreds of Hollywood musicals, hundreds.. With classical music, La La Land is another one of those on the list,
this is something fresh to the table, it's refreshing and just borderline FUN.

I don't see what you're seeing either, from the lyrics and the song I am easily getting the characters emotion, and exactly am seeing what is happening. The song ""Million Dreams"" easily is telling the story, I don't see the idea of ""filler"" from the drums either, the piano that runs in is slowly the buildup of the song, which is telling the story, and then the orchestra that comes in is showcasing you the build-up and excitement the character is seeing and dreaming of, and that's exactly what it's representing.

drnd7u1,"That's what I mean. Gosling and Emma's vocals are weak and a bit too stale. That's all auto-tune on their tracks, their voices like I said are stale.

You're confusing TGS ""auto-tune"" with overproduction, which most pop songs are heavily like. All music is auto-tuned, every track you listen to on the radio, or wherever. There is a giant difference when one track is heavily auto-tuned example is T-Pain, none of TGS tracks sound like that, which is what you are saying. That's just purely overproduction, which ALL pop music naturally suffers.

Emma and Gosling don't have vocal talent, Emma is a bit better than Gosling, but, sometimes they didn't even feel like singing, their voices are strongly overproduced, same with auto-tuned, but they too suffer a lot of overpro sounds, with a strong mix of auto-tune, the only thing that masks it is the fact that they're singing Jazz songs.

Give Emma and Gosling the same tracks Hugh had the sing, they'll need double what any track on TGS had.

That's because, I still can't wrap my mind around all the things you're seeing with La La Land, both of us have completely different opinions, lol.
