This film had one of the best audience reactions I've experienced, without annoying me at all. I feel like the film wanted to take the audience on a ride and wanted you to do what a classic horror film does. Interact and just have a fun ass time.

Whenever he's been hypnotized by the teacup up to that point, his physical body gets locked into a trance. This time, he goes limp. It's because he knows the teacup takes him out of the world, but doesn't know what his outward physical reaction is. He just assumes it's passing out. He's faking the hypnosis and putting on a show for whoever might be watching, but it's not correct. Luckily, no one is around to catch it.",5vv1qh

degmc7k,The most telling moment for me in this film was that I found myself more terrified of the prospect of [the police man from earlier being the one to roll up on him at the end rather than the actual horrors that were going on inside the house](#spoiler) I think it was a testament to how black people in America face true terror everyday from the legal system and not some crazy household.

[Jeremy scoffed at Chris taking judo lessons as a kid and explains that jiu jitsu is better. Why? Because it's like chess, you have to think three steps ahead. So fast forward to their fight in front of the doorway. Chris is desperately trying to stab Jeremy in the leg but can't reach him. However, he notices as soon as he gets the door open Jeremy kicks it shut. EVERY TIME. So Chris thinks three steps ahead and tries one last time to open the door, knowing that if he does then Jeremy will stick his leg out where Chris is then able to stab it.](#spoiler)

Rose did that throughout the first two acts. She appeared to defend him to the cop and she launched into the diatribe about how embarrassing her family was, but whenever Chris tried to express to her what was bothering him, she dismissed it -- and THEN made it about herself when he said he wanted to leave.

de55gev,"Okay so the people who had already been transferred. They were acting weird because they were pretending to be black ? Because they are acutaly the grandparents or the lady's husband, but they can't talk an act like who they really are because it would be obvious am I right ? ",5vv1qh
defbf16,"I haven't seen anyone talk about this so far, so I wanted to elaborate on the aspects of this movie that struck me the most: 

1. Daniel Kaluuya's portrayal of Chris is what makes the final act so impactful. His demeanor is delicately balanced between terrified and *unsurprised* because he is a man that has been taught throughout his life that he should expect to be endangered, betrayed, used, and exploited because of his blackness.  While fighting to get away, he gives the distinct impression of a man who is just really fucking tired, because, as said in the film, he has been told to expect this. He plays a man who has already learned to adapt to constant implicit and explicit threats based around his race and it is chilling to see exhaustion playing on the face of a character who would typically be portrayed as panicked. Notable is the fact that the horror cliche ""why are you doing this"" line never comes out of Chris's mouth--in fact, when he's asked if he has any questions, he doesn't say anything. He knows why they are doing it; he's spent his whole life learning why they were doing this. 

2. The Armitages are a perfect construct to represent the complicated history of whiteness within America. The fact that, while they stand in a beautiful mansion on an expansive plot of land surrounded by their trophies from world travel, that they still make a point of lingering on the fact that a black man beat grandpa in the Olympics is so striking; the focus on the few things they don't have or didn't win while living in complete comfort. The irony of a family making the argument that black people have it great in the modern day US while they take bids from people trying to buy him is a very simple and direct way to broach the delusions that many white Americans have constructed to avoid discussions of the real problems that center on race and racism that are occurring today. They actually believe that black people are winning while they exploit black people to increase their wealth and connections. 

3. It so beautifully forces the audience to face the way white people are given the benefit of the doubt. You are encouraged to make excuses for Rose throughout the whole movie until you literally have no other option but to accept that she was in on it. This is followed shortly by the cop car scene, which I firmly believe is a perfect moment in film. The unexpectedness of it takes your breath away in part because without realizing it the film as broached the topic of police brutality. It introduces the cop car in such a way that you instantly have to face what you know and have always known is going to come next: the cop will shoot Chris because he is a black man covered in blood standing over the body of a white woman who is begging for help. And in so doing it makes you face ALLLLLLL of those viral videos of police brutality towards black men, because you now realize that, despite the fact that you know Chris is the good guy and that you know Rose is evil, you also know that in a real world scenario, Chris would be the one to end up dead. ",5vv1qh
de5mlkc,"I've read through a lot of the comments, and noticed no one has mentioned how Jordan Peele, instead of going after the presumably easy target, the right winged republicans, he instead writes the bad guys as liberals. I found that aspect of the characters interesting. ",5vv1qh

I mean if they're all part of this evil plan, why is the brother picking fights and acting really hostile towards him? Why is everyone so weird and yet the art dealer is able to act totally normal?

Like the Grandma and Grandpa are in the maid and groundskeepers bodies but the only time they act like themselves or when they're trying to kill him.](#spoiler)

Also a cool thing that occurred to me as I was walking home.

[The grandpa was controlling the groundskeeper and he was constantly running as an exercise, and I remembered how he was beaten by Jesse Owens in the Olympic qualifying race.

Peele could've gone the obvious, cliche route, where the white folks in the film assumed racial stereotypes of the black man, e.g. if Chris is assumed to like basketball, and he responds that he likes ""hockey, not all black men like basketball.""

Rose has this sadistic smile because she realizes that, in her last moments alive, she's succeeding in bringing Chris to the brink of becoming a beast—to use Jeremy's word—and she's just imagining what the repercussions will be. And then when he loosens his grip, she realizes that, in what is likely her last act, she has failed to do that. The disorientation she experiences from that is what we see on her face right afterward. And when the cop car comes up, she's more than happy to quickly switch into victim mode, which is excruciating because so much of the audience assumes that this is the end for Chris. Then when you find out that it's Rod, the look on her face is defeat. I think part of why Chris is content to let Rose perish slowly on the road by herself is to leave her with the knowledge that, not only did she fail at the job that she thinks she's so good at, but she also failed to break him in the way that she was so sure she'd be able to do.

I saw this with a very fun audience in Brooklyn. The director, Jordan Peele, was present for a Q&A afterwards. One thing he mentioned was that he feels everyone, of all races, has racist tendencies. The main character has to deal with his own assumptions about Black women, for example, as he assumes Georgina(?) the maid was being hostile toward him because she might resent him for being with a white woman. As he said to his girlfriend, ""it's a thing."" And this assumption blocks him from assessing the situation clearly.

JP also mentioned he has several other films planned which will address different social contructs. Really looking forward to them.

My biggest laugh was definitely the Japanese millionaire (an ode to Rosemary's Baby) asking the question about whether being Black was more advantageous or less advantageous. I can't completely coherently describe why that line got me so hard, but as a Black woman who has gone through graduate art school, sometimes the intellectualizing of race gets ridiculous. I have had the experience of sitting within a group of non-Black people and had this question directed at me, and although the person asking is trying to sound academic and intelligent, ultimately the question is too simple and the answers are too complex. And sometimes I have to wonder how anyone with eyes can even ask such a question. In the end, most of us know the social hierarchy of the racial lottery. As a Black woman with a lighter brown skin, finer features and long hair I know I have been given some preferences in life, and it would be disengenuous to suggest otherwise. It kills me when people pretend we don't colorize. We do it amongst humans obviously, then within race. Blondes versus brunettes, etc. And yes, many people have racial envy that goes against the grain. I digress. Very fun film, and I agree it could have been more scary. The showdown scene was too short but there was still a lot to enjoy.

After hitting the deer, the responding cop--often considered the epitome of institutional racism--seemingly commits the microagression of asking for the Chris's ID, and the white liberal girlfriend defends her boyfriend vocally. We don't know this at the time, but it's perhaps her way of concealing evidence of Chris's whereabouts. Asking for ID seemed an  unnecessary act motivated by racism, and it's the type of law enforcement strategy (e.g. stop and frisk) that many conservatives advocate (and are pilloried for) as a way to make urban neighborhoods safer, but it may have ultimately saved Chris's life.",5vv1qh

On the actual story, I thought there was very little wasted motion in the film. Their concern over him smoking, the brother asking if he can fight in MMA, the woman feeling his bicep, the bingo game, all of it made so much sense once we got the big reveal. Everything seemed to have a specific purpose in what was essentially a modern recreation of a slave auction.

I have to analyze everything I do from the way I wear my hair, what clothes I wear, who I date, where and when I drive, who I fuck, to how I express emotion much more than others, particularly in majority white spaces. Chris saying he gets nervous around too many white people is real life for a lot of us. Can you imagine having to be on edge like that every freaking day? At the doctor, in the office, at the store, and like in this movie, even in your relationships? He tried explaining the ""subtleties"" to his girlfriend and she couldn't see it. Later we learn why, but it's really introducing people to a language they don't understand. A lot of people don't see it because they don't live it and they've never been forced to. The invasion of personal space, the need to relate in a condescending way, the reassurance that they're cool because they experience black by proxy, the sexualization, this is shit that happens every freaking day and it's fucking exhausting. Sometimes you want to be around people who understand what that's  like. If that makes some white people uncomfortable to hear, imagine living it everyday.

She starts with beautiful bangs that lit up her face and she wears brightly colored clothes. As soon as she reveals her true self, she puts her hair up, and the scenes after that show her wearing neutral colors. The lighting of the scenes she was in also added to giving her a very bland, and cold appearance. Her hair and her face look a lot more dull and less lively.

Similarly to how she uses her forehead to hide her scar, Walter and Andre wear hats to hide their scars.

Honestly, the movie doesn't insult the audience whatsoever and manages to build tension all the way. I knew things would go bad like any horror film, but I wasn't sure exactly how it would go down and the movie kept me guessing up until the end. 

I was comparing this to RE7 with my friend. How both talk about ""the family"" and take place in like the same geographical area and basically a plantation. Except in this case, Get Out goes deeper than RE7 by adding an extra layer of social commentary on race, while still providing a similar experience of tension.

Interesting to contrast that while Chris is dealing with this ridiculous white family, his TSA friend was dealing with these ridiculous black cops. 

No overabundance of horror tropes, however a few do make an appearance. I wasn't concerned with this, really.

de6loml,"GET OUT THEORY ABOUT THE DEER:

Okay so I have this theory about the film that I'm really sure I'm right about but need to discuss with people cause it's driving me nuts.

So there's this recurring motif of deer throughout the film. When Chris's car gets hit by a deer at the beginning of the film, it's almost as if the deer is running from something or is consciously trying to kill itself. Chris looks deep into the deer's eye and the two share a moment, almost as if they know each other.

THEN when they get to Rose's parents' house, Rose's dad says that he's glad that they killed the deer, that he wants all of them to eventually be dead. He talks about the deer as though he is personally disgusted and affected by them.

THEN, when Chris is tied up in the room with the TV, there's a deer head mounted on the wall. This is revealed just as the man on the TV is explaining how they remove the brains of the black people to make room for the white people's brains inside the black bodies.

SO THEN WHAT DO THEY DO WITH THE BLACK PEOPLE'S BRAINS? I'll tell you what they do: They put them inside the bodies of deer and then go out and hunt them! That's why Chris recognized the deer at the beginning of the film, because Andre's brain was in there! And they recognized each other!

This makes sense to me since the film is so subtle with its plot devices but I really need a confirmation of this from other viewers or from anyone who worked on the film. What do you guys think?",5vv1qh

TL;DR: Feel however you want to about the movie, but realise that this was made for black people like me and my family, to give words and validation to our pain. To say it's sole purpose was to shame is wholly incorrect. 

-

Hear me out, the sunken place was an interesting tool to describe the hypnosis process, but it represents so much more. In my experience, being black and having been raised in a white culture but now living in a racist part of Australia puts you in your own sunken place. The other black people I've talked to about this feel exactly the same way. 

It's a metaphor for a deep, deep isolation in an environment that constantly reminds you that ""You are different and that's what we don't like about you"". But the thing is, there is no hypnosis that's puts you there, YOU YOURSELF enter due to the countless interactions, the ignorant, racist comments/questions, the looks.... Of disgust at the sight of you dirtying their pure white space. 

So what do you do? Day by day, you sink a little further into your own sunken, low, dark, depressed place. A place where ""a tiny sliver of the original you remains"", but this ""other"" person is controlling you. A place where you're wrapped in an existential knot on the inside but are the calm, approachable black man with a straw hat on the outside so as to not scare white folk' when you walk in a room. Before you realise, the person in the mirror cannot be recognised and the person in the sunken space has all but lost his voice. 

Now someone comes along and says to you ""what are you talking about, racism is dead, nobody calls you n-word anymore"" ",5vv1qh

Now I know Peele is a talented dude but I honestly went in expecting just a somewhat better than average horror flick with some heavy handed social commentary. But man, I was completely blown away by this. Peele really outdid himself here and I'm really excited to see what he does next.

It's less of a horror imo (save for maybe the third act) and more of a psychological thriller. I can't remember the last time I was genuinely on the edge of my seat in a movie theater; tense for what was about to happen next. Despite all the commentary on the current racial tension, it never feels like too much to me. Of course that's what this movie is going to be talked about for, but if you get past that it's just a damned good movie. Both the main actor and his girlfriend were fantastic in this. 

The cinematography was great, even surprisingly artful at times. There's a whole eerie and uncomfortable vibe throughout, and I haven't felt more satisfied at the death of fictional characters in a long while lol. Peele leaves breadcrumbs the whole way through but I never managed to fully piece it together until the multiple reveals. The protagonist doesn't do anything downright stupid either, so he's easy to root for.

Man I was just so pleasantly surprised by how well this movie was made. Good writing, well acted, and it was shot great too. Definitely gonna be recommending this to everyone. The relevance of its social commentary is just the icing on the cake. It wasn't perfect, (him finding the photographs at the very end felt like too much of a gimme, and you have to suspend your disbelief for the villain's actual scheme) but it's easily my favorite film of 2017 so far.

I love how the commercials did a good job telling you the concept, and it was pretty obvious early on what was going on exactly. I mean the whole secret society was a surprise but the idea that the family was brainwashing black people to turn them into quasi-slaves was pretty obvious. And not in the ""I figured out your movie before you wanted me to"" obvious sort of way (A Cure For Wellness), either.

They basically make it obvious so that they can hit you with the third act surprises...chief among them was Rose being in on it.

I was sure that they were going to have Rose be brainwashed after each black guy is roped in and that would be ending, with Chris either getting got or getting out but with Rose getting brainwashed to find the family's next victim.

When she pulled out the keys and her whole expression changed, I was very impressed. 

My only two critiques are minor. I would say they had to rush through the third act, throwing a lot of ""plot"" at the audience after so much set-up in the first two acts.

Also, and this is more of a joke than anything, but they had it TEED UP for Keegan-Michael Key to be the ""NCAA top prospect"" that Rose is scouting at the end. 

Ah well.

I think my favorite scene of the film, and so far my favorite scene in any horror movie this year (I've seen a few) is when Chris goes up the stairs and everyone suddenly stops their conversation to listen. Really effectively creepy.

- When the guests at the auction are sizing up Chris to fulfil their own desires, the Asian man asks if it’s more or less advantageous to be a black man in America. This is because, as an Asian immigrant, the bidder probably faces his own discrimination and he is trying to size up whether it’s better or worse for him to a black man.

- When Chris is being prepped for surgery, and we see Rose scouting other candidates on her computer, she has hung the photographs of her previous victims on her bedroom wall in the way that one mounts animal/deer heads that they have hunted.

- When Rod goes to the police about Chris, at first I was skeptical that they would believe him. But when I saw that it was a black policewoman I thought, perhaps she will believe him. Then, she called on her colleagues who were also black. The background of the police really mattered to me here, because I thought Rod was more likely to believed given that they were black (but he still was not).

- There were several “signs” that Rose was in on it. For example:

For someone who has never dated a black person before, and has only dated Chris for 4 months, she knew an awful lot about the plight of African Americans in America, in a way that you wouldn’t expect. For example, the way she steps in to question the police for checking Chris’ ID and saying she has his back. Chris is really passive in these moments and doesn’t seem to express the impact they have on him, so how is she so intimately aware about the plight of black Americans?

When Chris goes upstairs at the party and everyone immediately stops talking, Rose was still downstairs. She followed him up in the next scene, but did not think the guests behaviour odd or mention it to Chris.

When Chris becomes uncomfortable at the party, it is Rose who suggested that they go for a walk. Taking Chris away from the party is what allowed the silent auction to be held.",5vv1qh

That is how my brother saw it as well and I think it is very possible that that is what it is about, maybe even likely.
However, I saw it a bit differently. I think it is possible that Rose intentionally targeted black people who smoked because it gave Missy an excuse to put them under hypnosis. Recall how vehement Dean was that her treatment worked like a charm and how he couldn't even look at a cigarette after she put him under. I think this could have been one of their tricks to break the ice about hypnosis, which of course is crucial to their plan.

dgr41nz,"A few observations. Apologies if some have been covered. I think I've read the whole thread but i may have missed a post or two.

1) Throughout the whole film, the only mobile phones we see belong to Chris, Rod and Andre... perhaps because the Armitages and their friends fear the flashes going off and sending the black hosts into a seizure? Also explains why Georgia/Grandma was so keen to drain the battery on Chris's phone.

2) We see Rod in the apartment in front of the TV or laptop a lot... The moment he realises that something is seriously wrong, he gets off his ass and goes to the police... which young Chris didn't do when his mother didn't come home. Rod = hero.

3) The brother telling Chris about Rose's childhood, when her crush went in for a kiss and got his tongue nearly bitten off by her. A pretty on-the-money metaphor for her future role in the family set up. He also says that she kept her toe nails which she chewed up and spat into a box. Fast forward to Chris finding a red box and seeing photos of past lovers she's also chewed up and spat out.

They feel like if they were someone in the movie, they would be the helpful, non-racist white person.

Once he's come to terms that he is in grave danger, he has no hesitation to fight back (even though it was too late by then).

He stopped playing the tune, everyone ended up in the house, and all hell broke loose. In effect, the end of the tune indicated to Chris that ""the gigue (jig) was up""... that's what I got from it at least ☺️",5vv1qh

Also, when Walter tells Chris that ""I should get back to work and **mind my own business**"" it just seems creepy as fuck to us. But seeing it as a 100 year old white man saying it, it just falls into place perfectly! That's exactly how the elderly would speak...

[After seeing the ending of the movie, I realized the cop from the beginning might have asked for Chris' ID because he felt like something was strange with the Armitage family and wanted to know who he was incase a missing persons report was filed.

di0ydaa,"Question for everybody: Do you think hitting the deer was planned?

I'm on the fence, but I think this could have been interesting. People here have already made some great observations about many moments that were well foreshadowed or make more sense in retrospect. The dad hates deer and is killed with a deer head. The brother is defeated in combat because Chris thinks a step ahead. When the girlfriend opposes Chris showing his ID to the police she wasn't really making a racial statement, she was minimizing evidence of him being there. So on and so forth. There is so much evidence for the family's ""wrangling"" operation to be really systematic and insiduous.

So do you think the deer was planted? I mean, the way it just *flies* into the road makes for a great jumpscare and isn't necessarily unbelievable (those accidents happen fast), but in retrospect it seems almost too perfect. 

We know from their conversation by the lake that Chris had told Rose way back that his mother was killed in a hit & run. And that trauma clearly featured very heavily into the hypnotism of him.

So it seems possible that they didn't hit the deer on accident, but rather that the incident was staged to **prime** him for the hypnotism that would happen later. Get him subconsciously dwelling on those memories again.

The one argument I could come up with against this theory would be that them hitting the deer leads to the cop being called, which puts an undue risk at the family's operation being exposed. But him being called could have been more at Chris' behest than Rose's.


",5vv1qh
djopfdq,"I thought it was interesting that the motivation wasn't so much white supremacy as white inferiority. The old, white people wanted to be black because to be black was to be stronger, faster, and (in the case of Chris, at least) more talented.

df9x861,"I'm kind of late, as I finally saw the movie last night, but I wanted to talk about something that bothered me a little. Certainly nothing major, but I was slightly annoyed. It has to do with both the trailer for the movie and the poster.

The first thing is about the helmet, the one used by the son which is later found by Chris in his car. A person wearing the helmet is seen on the [movie poster,](https://cdn.traileraddict.com/content/universal-pictures/get-out-2017-2.jpg) in the [TV commercial,](http://imgur.com/euTHS3a.png) and in the [movie trailer](http://imgur.com/ZdFVVgo.png) (this one is also in the commercial). Now, unless I'm forgetting a very, very quick flashback, these shots were never in the movie. You might think that this is from the beginning of the movie when Andre is captured, but it is definitely not. In that scene the kidnapper's head is shown to be covered, but it's shown from a distance and it's pretty dark, so it's not clear that the person is wearing a helmet. Also, in all 3 of these shots, if you look closely, you can see that it is raining. It was not raining in the scene with Andre. And the most obvious thing is that in these shots the person is holding a gun and the person he shot has a tranquilizer dart sticking out of him. There was no gun used in the scene with Andre. The man who was shot in the commercial was also shown for a split second running away and it's clearly not Andre.

The other thing is this [weird ghostly deer skeleton](http://i.imgur.com/8aIs0h0.png) shown at the end of the trailer. What the hell is that? That definitely wasn't in the movie. Probably just something they threw in the trailer to make it seem more scary. Or maybe all these things were from scenes that got deleted from the final cut.

Now, like I said, these are very minor complaints that don't affect the movie as a whole. However, I do have to admit that when seeing the trailer and commercials, these were things that stood out to me and set certain expectations for the movie that weren't fulfilled. Overall, I enjoyed the movie and thought it was pretty darn good, but I was left a little disappointed because I was expecting to see those things and they never happened.",5vv1qh

the carpet in the basement where they kept Chris seems to have been chosen purely to match [the brother's freckles](http://i.imgur.com/eQ1STVk.png). Wonderful visuals all around.

After it turned out that he didn't, the boots turned into a Tchekhov's gun that I couldn't get my mind off of for the rest of the movie. Seeing it finally go off when he stomps the brother to death was brilliant.

Oh and one last thing: the brother's animal-like whimpers after getting hit by the ball seemed to hint at the fact that he still needed to be ""put down,"" foreshadowing his attack in the foyer.

By the end of the movie we realize this was to eliminate any trail of Chris's presence, but then why would she call the police in the first place?  There was no reason to call anyone - all they did was hit a deer.

2. After the Mom hypnotized Chris, the next morning Chris goes outside to talk to the groundskeeper.  By the end of the movie we know the groundskeeper is the grandpa, so why would the grandpa risk agitating Chris by telling him he saw Chris with the Mom for a two hour ""session"", a session the grandpa would know Chris would have no recollection of.",5vv1qh

[I really liked the dynamic between Chris and Rose, that looked really genuine and really well acted. I loved that scene where she sticks up for him when the cop for no real reason asks for his ID. I like what these two had going on.....i absolutely did not see that twist coming that she was in on it.That scene where Chris discovers those photos i was hoping that this meant Rose had been under hypnosis all that time and that she wasn't to blame, but soon we find out she's just exactly like her family. Rose's actress did a damn fine job i must say, because she looked so genuine and well meaning and when we get that twist, she acts the part for sure. And man when that cop car arrived for a second i was afraid it was the real police and they would get the wrong idea and maybe shoot Chris. Damn glad this didn't happen at all though.

Something I noticed when Chris starts fucking up those white bitches was when he killed the father.

And good Lord, was it satisfying to watch him absolutely destroy those white fuckers.  I'm white, by the way.  I think all races can agree that we wanted to watch those people suffer

They're pretty obscure but maybe someone can shed some light, and I only ask because everything in this movie seems to have meaning behind it.

1. The basement decor is very 60s/70s-esque, starkly contrasted with the rest of the house. Any explanations?
2. Why is the brother playing mandolin/whatever when Rose and Chris get back from their walk while all the party guests are leaving?
3. When Chris is first hypnotized and wakes up in the bed, does he just rationalize it away as a bad dream? He tells Rose he thinks the mom hypnotized him and it gave him bad dreams but why is he not asking how he ended up back upstairs in the bed?",5vv1qh

dfaasz1,"I keep thinking about the opening scene of the film where Andre is taken into Jeremy's trunk and what Andre and Chris represent. I have a theory that Andre sensed the weirdness in that town and was trying to ""get out."" But, when he did, he was hunted and brought down anyway (maybe like the civil rights leaders in the 1960's who pointed out the vast civil inequalities and while changing the system were brought down against their will?) 

The entire movie is a push and pull of us watching Chris and wanting him to leave, but understanding why he would stay. The weirdness and racism that he points out to Rose is brushed off by her, as you guys have stated, she gaslights him. This seems to represent the current experience that people of color may have when pointing out/explaining white privilege and systemic racism to white people. But, due to purposeful ignorance (to continue to suppress black people--but in a non-aggressive way) or just a plain lack of awareness or education on the matter, Peele points out that white people are complicit in the act of racism itself.

Andre knew that shit was weird, he was the canary in the coal mine. He tried to leave and he tried to warn Chris, but he was the sacrificial lamb that created an awareness of the problem for Chris and the audience. Chris (in keeping with the civil rights symbolism) is the next generation that thinks it is safe out there right now, and went directly into the fire, only to find that it most definitely isn’t safe (looking at Trump’s America here), and he represents a generation that will hopefully go beyond talking about the issue and kick ass during a time of complacency (which we seemed to face during the Obama era). 

I heard some people say this movie is aggressively negative about white people and they might be offended by that. I can understand how they might feel that way, but I don’t think this movie was made “for” white people. And white people are not used to that.

Fuckin' hell, that killer line. Exceptionally clever script bolstered by great performances, although I would've liked to see a bit more of Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener. Delivered its message very efficiently, even if the plot twist was intentionally over-the-top. Amusingly enough, the true horror in this film is purely dialogue based instead of disturbing images. We feel more anxiety from Chris being treated like a Mandingo sex slave from the suburb clan rather than we do with the traditional horror elements.

Was disappointed that we didn't see Jeremy's brains smashed in or Missy's eye stabbed out. Maybe I'm just a gore hound, because those two seconds and the brain surgery just didn't cut it for me. Also, where the hell was the scene with the roaring deer skeleton?

dezi3r0,"I just finished watching this movie, and I think it is one of the best Directorial Debuts since *Reservoir Dogs*! Jordan Peele really knows how to make a horror movie that hit's all the right marks (well placed jump scares, a story that keeps you guessing until just the right moment, the way he uses sound to cause feelings of suspense, dread, and ultimately fear), and then goes beyond that to create this fantasy where the bad guys are people that you probably know. Upper-Middle Class white Liberals, people who reminded me of my parents and certain family members in a lot of ways. And then he uses those characters to suggest that maybe, in the back of their minds, some deep-seated, intense, racism lingers, waiting to get out. And that's what makes this movie terrifying. For a brief instance, it makes you think 'Did I ever find out what was inside of Aunt Bertha's basement that one day?' or 'Why wasn't I allowed in Dad's woodshed?'. Of course, you shouldn't dwell on things like that for too long, because it's all just fantasy, albeit a shockingly relevant fantasy. Or is it?",5vv1qh

That was a connection I made while thinking about it near the end of the film, and it kind of hit me hard, but I also thought about how many things said or done in the movie would have hit even harder obviously if you are black..

That auction was so fucking creepy. When they panned out to show Chris' photo ... Ugh.

A couple of questions:

1. Do you think Andre was set up to be caught? Who was he on the phone with - maybe Rose? Or was he just a lucky / random catch for Jeremy who may have been cruising the neighborhood for any black guy?

2. What happens to the old white people's bodies once their brains are transferred into the younger black people? I am assuming they have family, friends, coworkers who will wonder where they went? Or is everyone in on this? Do they say ""next time you see me I'll be a young black man""? In particular, the art dealer who wanted to take over Chris.

Why did the dad start the lobotomy on the blind guy when chris wasn't even in the same room? Yeah, it's an easy plot device (easier for chris to escape), or maybe it's the dad being over confident that the procedure was going to work?
I'm no neurosurgeon, I don't know how these things work, but I did find it odd.

I'm glad someone explained the presence of the random Asian guy. I thought it was a play on the idea of the ""token black guy,"" but a previous commenter shared a really great article with a theory about him representing Asians' passive acceptance of racism/their own struggle of seeing themselves as never quite able to fully assimilate into white culture while being superior to black people.

Random observation that may be a technicality, but the license plates had no States included. It was a generic white plate with black text that I initially thought was a California plate. My initial thought was a ""this could happen anywhere"" notion, but as I was typing this out, I thought of another thing- the white background is the largest (or most populous) part of the plate. The black parts are much smaller, but also the most critical piece since they contain the plate number itself.

1. Colored separated from the white. 
2. She had stopped developing mentally at the age when she began playing different people. Which is why she had the teddy bear, the snack and listening to Time of Your Life. 
3. Her job gives her no control over her personal identity. So everything reverts back to being very tidy and particular. 
4. Can't wait to get the bangs out of her face and go back to the blank state that she is. No humor, no personality, etc. 


Rose method was far worse than Jeremy because she'd make people fall in love and then break they're heart. 

Every look Rose gave the guests had two meanings. 
1. Stop being mean to her BF.
2. Stop being so obvious with your racism so you don't give anything away.

df3pzbu,"Three weeks late to the party as I live in the UK and it only just opened this week here. All I can say is — WOW. The film has received tons of press here over the last month, particularly in relation to its social commentary from papers such as The Guardian. I'm so used to being disappointed by films given such praise and press, but I really feel the hype was well deserved. It exceeded my expectations.

It takes incredible skill to make a film that is genuinely scary and unsettling, but at the same time hilarious. What I liked was that those two elements were almost separate (the scares weren't funny for example, humour didn't get in the way of suspense as with most horror comedies). The scares and laughs worked really well along side each other. It was less a 'horror comedy' than a unique mish-mash of horror and comedy.

The audience reaction was something else. Having been to see films in the USA, I can state that in the UK (with the exception of laughter), it is really incredibly uncommon for an audience to react loudly or vocally here. But there were several points that solicited a huge audience reaction  — even shouting and applause. This was a very special film indeed. I wasn't really that aware of Peele before this film (he's not exactly well known here), but I think the man is clearly an incredibly talented writer and director. Can't wait to see what he does next.

One thought I had on the way home from the cinema, which I wanted to ask you all about. Did anyone find that the procedure — using people as a 'new' body/vessel while the original mind is left to helplessly witness everything from afar in 'the sunken place' — reminded them of Being John Malkovich? I always found that concept absolutely terrifying, and felt the same way here. The way it was represented on screen with Chris floating in a void creeped me out to no end.",5vv1qh

Too many people here are focused on tiny details like the house not having top notch security or cameras and i get the movie has some flaws but cmon really?? if there was security codes and cams then their would be no proper ending, chris would die and thats that.

Reading through the comments I noticed something interesting. Lots of opinions on the purpose of the reoccurring deer theme. The hunting aspect or the disregard for its life. No one has mentioned ""black buck"" as the name for male slaves. Maybe because there are no older Southerners in this thread. Slave auction advertisements listed bucks (males) and wenches (women). 

I liked how they alluded to liberal white women's role in racism. From the ""I'm just trying to help"" mom to the  microaggressions of the party guests to the ""cry for help"" after Allison clearly instigated or caused the problem. 

At first I didn't get the purpose of the Asian guy, but looking back I have an idea. Asians are often seen as the model minority. The question he asked Chris was kind of saying ""we're not in the same fight"" plus I have the resources to participate in oppressing you. 

Lastly, no one thought it was weird how Grandpa/Groundskeeper talked about the girlfriend being sexy? Basically the grandpa (& grandma) had sex with Allison because they were her former back lovers. Weird, incestuous family. ",5vv1qh

Then, he says ""When [the grandparents] died, we couldn't bear to let them go.""on the surface, it sounds like Whitford is saying he couldn't bear to let the servants go, but on a deeper level, he's saying they couldn't let the grandparents go, since they are living on in Georgina's and Walters's bodies.

Also, several mentions if those two servants being ""part of the family"".",5vv1qh
de9e3wa,"Holy shit, there's so much to unpack here.
There is so much symbolism and metaphoric analysis to be done, but I just want to focus on a few things:

The movie did an excellent job of understanding how an audience reacts. It knows when to insert humor, and when to reveal unsettling information. The timing of it all was spot on. 

I never felt like the movie was treating me like I was stupid. Horror movies tend to assume their audience is dumb, so if they want to place in imagery or meaningful backstory, they usually spend an enormous amount of screentime developing those ideas. As a result, plot usually lacks. But Get Out was so brilliant because it threw minor details at the audience which seemed insignificant, but ended up being crucial in the end. For example, Chris clawing at the arms of the chair holds two separate purposes: firstly, to emphasize his emotional distress when his mother died, and secondly, to set up his eventual escape. It was such a small detail that few people would predict how it would come to play out in the end, but wasn't completely skimmed over.

I only have two observations that I haven't seen anyone address here:

1) The stuffed lion that Chris turns away from the bed earlier in the movie, ends up facing the bed every scene after that. I'm not sure what significance that holds, but I'm sure it means something.

2) Chris only found out about his girl's previous relationships because that closet door was left open. It can be assumed that the girlfriend isn't dumb enough to let that happen, but then who left it open? Georgina? And if it was Georgina, then what does that imply when it comes to the mind control? If a host person fights hard enough, can they break free for moments at a time? Just something interesting.

Loved the movie, 9.5/10 in my opinion.",5vv1qh
de9g2ce,"I had a good idea what the movie was going to be about going in,so I wondered from the beginning if the mom getting killed by a hit and run was fabricated by the villains so he would have a traumatic focus for his hypnosis? 

I wonder if anyone else noticed that when the girlfriend is on her computer looking for the next victim, she has the cereal, 'colored' froot loops separate from her white milk that she drank with a black straw instead of eating it with her cereal, perhaps because she doesn't want to taint the milk?  I thought was a nice touch of symbolism. 

I think the only thing that gave me the 'why don't they just run sideways' moment was when he used the fabric to plug his ears. How did he reach his head if his hands were tied down?  I guess he happened to be pretty flexible? 

For people who felt offended by the movie because of the racial element, rather than look at it as an attack, try to see it more as a exaggerated play on the fears anybody who is different feels about the other. When you're any kind of different, you don't really know what the other person is really thinking about you. Are they just nice because they 'have to' be?  What will happen to me when they don't? Rather than get angry, try and talk out how it made you feel, listen to how other people took it.  it necessary for the discussion of race that I think this movie intended to entice, rather than trying to send a hateful message.

dehu3l6,"I feel like out of the whole Armitage family, Jeremy is the least psychopathic. Throughout the movie, the Armitage family remains calm and collected despite their actions, especially Rose, which is why I think she's the most psychopathic. Out of the whole family, she gets closest to Chris and develops a bond with him, yet she is unaffected by the horrors she puts him through. In order to chase after him outside of the burning house, she would have had to see her dead family members, but she also remained fairly calm as she shot at Chris. On the other hand, from when Jeremy is introduced, he is obviously an unstable character. His emotionality sets him apart from the family, who remains fairly stoic throughout the movie. During dinner, I think he drinks a little too much because he knows what is about to go down, and unlike the rest of the family, he has a little more conscience, and he needs to gather the strength to join his family's cause. Watching his interactions with his family, I think he may himself have experienced forms of hypnotism because he's especially obedient towards his mother. ",5vv1qh

deqol2b,"For the people who keep complaining about Georgina, Walter, Logan acting like robots or zombies  (something that Grace Randolph complained about as well) 

Think of this way. Jesse Owens won the Olympic gold in 1936. Lets assume Grandpa was 19 when he lost to him in the trials. 

That would make him 100 years old. 

They weren't acting like zombies. They were acting like 100 year old white people trying to pretend to be black people in front of Chris. Remember Grandpa is the first one to greet the guests. He probably is far more comfortable being who he really is around them than around Chris putting on an act. 

When you watch the movie a 2nd time knowing whats going on its clear that they aren't acting like zombies. Just themselves, but off and out of touch. 

Logan for all we know could have been in his 70s or 80s. However, I thought he connected well for the most part. He just has the dead eyes a bit which seems to be a side effect of the procedure. 

Watching the movie the 2nd time knowing these are very old white people in black bodies speaking to a young black man it makes perfect sense. Georgina is the only one who really acts weird, but thats more of her vanity. Looking in the mirror at her looks, checking her scar, etc. But also the person in the Sunken Place fights harder to get out of her than anyone. ",5vv1qh

* The sudden pause and silence of the party goers as Chris went upstairs to check his phone.

I think if Chris had never seen the pictures and his first time realizing Rose's betrayal was when she pulls the keys out and says ""you know I can't do that"" it would have made that scene 100x better.

For example, when the father is talking about deer and how they're taking over, the underlying theme is that's what white supremacists feel about minorities. 


Or at the end when Rose becomes all ""helpless white lady,"" I literally went ""fuck no"" and I held my head in my hands because I thought Chris was FUCKED, but I was so relieved that it was Rodney. You think Chris is gonna get arrested and be misunderstood but nope, he's saved. I also loved how natural the comedic relief felt in this movie, not overly forced or campy. Like how Chris talks to Georgina and then goes ""This bitch is crazy..."" 


I didn't want to believe Rose was in on it because they seemed so cute together, but the picture scene got my heart racing. I felt his fear. And was she just friends with Georgina or do you think she faked a lesbian relationship? 


Also, I was wondering how they'd explain it to the cops but considering Walter and Georgina had the head scars and the man who was supposed to become Chris was left with his brain exposed, and the pseudo surgery room was still set up (hopefully not completely destroyed by the fire) they would have proof.

den022z,"Haven't see this observation in this thread so I'll post it.

The Sunken Place borrows heavily from *Under the Skin*'s Black Room/Liquid Abyss. Missy, (Rose's mom), sends Chris (and previous black **males**) into this psychological realm where he becomes the viewer/audience within his body -- powerless to control his body, and the realm Chris is in (his own mind) is devoid of any sound. Chris sees what is happening but cannot do anything about it. He sees Missy talking but cannot hear her as helplessly moves deeper into the dark abyss of his mind, further and further away from Missy's face...

Similarly, in *Under the Skin*, Johansson's character [lures her ***male*** victims into the Black Room, a realm/Void/liquid abyss where males are stripped of their internal organs leaving only the skin to be filled with another consciousness -- an *alien's* consciousness (A white persons brain transplanted would be transplanted into a black male body for *Get Out*). Listen carefully in to the clip below, the liquid abyss is also devoid of sound and the victim can see the Johansson walking away, and he is puzzled realizing, just like Chris, that he is no longer is in control of his situation (and never was from the beginning) but he only knows something bad is about to happen.](#spoiler)

In both movies, the males were always lured to a quiet secluded house by attractive women where such gruesome events would take place. In both movies, the victims learned of their demise, probably realizing that they'd never escape. For both *Get Out* and *Under the Skin*, the protagonist male are [the *first ever* to escape the woman's trap, only for the seductive women themselves to be killed by a man at the end of the film -- but you feel no sympathy for their deaths.](#spoiler)

To say that women are always the prey/victim would be a lie -- they can be just as much a predator as men.

* Video of Johansson luring her victim into the liquid abyss.

Also, Peele's directorial cleverness is exhibited when the *female* deer that was hit by the SUV (wimpering as it died) as Chris and Rose were *travelling to* the parents house and the police involvement after such a traumatic experience. At the end of the film, *Rose* dies (after pleading/wimpering for help, just like the deer did as Chris stood over it) and an government security agent, his friend Rod the TSA officer, *carries Chris away* from suburbia in the airport police car.

* Why wouldn't Rose have told Chris that she in fact did have previous black boyfriends whom her parents met and approved of? Knowing that Chris was already a bit on edge about the situation, I would think the family's plan should of included bringing Chris to the house with as little to worry about as possible. 

* I tried to count how many photos of the victims there were. At least a dozen.  Were all of these men (and one woman) successfully 'captured?'  Missing persons reports are taken more seriously than the film would lead you to believe. Rose would of been discovered pretty quickly as their significant other and questioned as to their whereabouts. The frequency of this occurrence would of lead authorities to believe she is somehow involved. 

* What was your interpretation of Jeremy, the bother? Does he have some kind of mental illness or disability?

One of my favorite thoughts has been that on paper this movie is on comedy, but it was presented as a horror film. The whole scene with your girl eating individual pieces of cereal and sipping milk definitely helped me realize this though.

I feel the marketing for the movie allowed me to connect the dots on certain things which to an extent spoiled specific plot points points. I also feel it mislead me on specific instances like the whole deal with the cop at the beginning which was really smart.

I'm sure I have other thoughts, but my mind is a jumbled mess rn so I'm cool with leaving it as this. I think a second viewing will help me get more of my thoughts straight.

Also, when was untied from the chair and knocked out Jeremy with the billiard ball thing, I would have done at least 2,000 more blows to the head. Kill that motherfucker! Like, completely. Make him not have a head any more.

And as soon as he saw Missy downstairs, he should have tackled her and choked her the fuck out. Kill that bitch immediately.

Also, Walter should have shot Rose in the face. I mean if you're going to take someone out, take them all the way out. 

As much as I understand that ""well, it's extremely stressful, you don't have time for perfect rational thought,"" I really think that the movie missed the mark on getting the urgency and stress of the situation across. Chris would have been running on pure adrenaline, there would be no stopping and thinking. You fucking attack and run.

All of this does seem like minor points that I'm overreacting to, but how unbelievable his behavior was actually had a significant impact on my viewing experience. It was so frustrating that the dude was still in the house. GET OUT!

All the casts did well. I really did believe Allison Williams' character til the reveal at the final act. 

All the butthurt people over the black vs white, they should calm down. I really saw the movie as a thriller, a movie I can picture Jordan Peele starting the premise and plot with a joke, not anything with a hidden agenda.

dh8blmi,"Anyone have insight to the deer symbolism? 

I just googled and got a few ideas which makes soooooooo much sense if you link it to the movie but this is just me going out on a whim!

""If Deer has crossed your path;

It is often a sign not to be too hard on yourself. Still the voice of the self critic and treat yourself with gentleness and understanding, be yourself and continue along your path. Seek out your inner treasures and use them generously to help those around you. Trust that kindness and graciousness will be well received.

We are also reminded that we cannot push towards change in others, rather we gently nudge them in the right direction with love and understanding. Lead by doing and showing the way.

Deer is a messenger of serenity, can see between shadows and hear what isn’t being said.

Deer teaches us to maintain our innocence and gentleness so we can share our open-heartedness with others."" Source: https://www.google.com.au/amp/www.spirit-animals.com/deer/amp/ 

As Chris and Rose on their way to the house had a deer literally cross their path. 
Chris can also see some little questionable things that make him uneasy as well as being able to see from the sunken place. 

Also with hypnotism, for it to work the person needs to be willing and open minded - not being able to push change upon others. As well as Rose leading Chris there etc. 

Think its pretty cool!

I feel it's more of a thriller than a horror, and the ""comedy"" category it's being put into is totally wrong imo.

I liked the way it [revealed that everyone was involved in the ""cult"" except the way the movie handled Rose.

Then shooting him because he’s a black man choking a white woman. Would’ve been an interesting take and another statement. That’s exactly what I thought was going to happen as the police lights flashed in the middle of that scene

The gf continues her family tradition and Rod is seen as crazy and is thrown into an asylum or mental help facility because everyone thinks he fabricated the story. 

Years later, Rod gets out mentally and physically weaker. Chris’ ex-GF contacts him to help get over his trauma and both get caught up in looking for Chris. It was alluded in the beginning and end that Rod lowkey had a thing for Chris’ GF that both of them acknowledge. While they are searching for Chris who went “missing,” the GF seduces and takes advantage of Rod’s weaker state and continues the tradition.

Sets up perfectly for a sequel",5vv1qh
ixaox1w,"I watched this movie a year back. I was initially skeptical, not because of the commentary, but because I knew of Jordan Peele back when he was an actor on MadTV. Although he's no stranger to blood, gore or even horror movie references, the guy's done it mostly for comedy and I didn't know if he could do Horror. However after his success with it as well as Us, as well as watching the first episode of his hosted Twilight Zone, I took a look at it.

In terms of story I loved it.  A unique story, but at the same time in terms of horror, it calls back to the classic stuff a lot.   The commentary was also unique and spot on due to the choice of villains.  The man could have went the conservative route and gotten cheers for it, but instead, he also points out very subtly that racism is beyond one party, by making the Armitage family go overtly liberal or at the very least pretend to be what they view as liberal.   Which on top of pointing it out, shows that anyone could have had these thoughts regarding Chris and the race as a whole.  Even the guy, whom was set up to be the only sane person of that group. The blind photographer whom Chris somewhat idolizes, despite not apparently having a prejudice bone in his body, represents people of the same mentality willing to abuse a racist system for their own benefits.  In his case, wanting Chris' eyes.

&#x200B;

However the thing that fascinated me the most about this movie, is one of the methods they used to try to get Chris and presumably how they got every other victim in the movie.  The hypnosis scene.  Specifically The Sunken Place.  While in this movie it's a minor part of a major plot and this does not pull punches on how scary and borderline supernatural the experience is, however I think in Peele's attempt to create a surreal freaky scene he struck gold regarding that method's potential.

&#x200B;

While he's mentioned there would be no sequel, I think should Peele change his mind, that the Sunken Place could be explored more.

&#x200B;

I myself am a bit of a nut when it comes to spirituality and while this scene shocked me the first time I watched it, I found myself fascinated by the potential of that mental prison.  As someone who's a nut for this kind of topic, one who has looked into both Self-Hypnosis and Meditation, have noticed somethings in that scene that were quite similar to other works.  Case in point Johnny Got His Gun and Earthbound.

&#x200B;

With Johnny Got His Gun, Joe Bonham who has lost all senses but touch, retreats into his own mind no different than Chris getting trapped in his, albeit with no visual reference like with Chris.  With the difference being that Joe filled his own ""Sunken Place"" with memories and fantasies.  From his loved ones, to visiting Jesus twice.

&#x200B;

With Earthbound, the character Poo, enters a meditative state known as ""Mu"" which in Japan means ""Nothing"" or ""Nothingness"" and as a result of the things taken from him, he ends up achieving a spiritual awakening before he meets up with Ness, Paula and Jeff.

&#x200B;

I theorize that much like how real life Hypnosis and Meditation, that The Sunken Place used to be a pleasant and/or neutral area that anyone can use for various reasons. However it only became scary, because Missy tainted it and turned it into a mental prison.",5vv1qh

Also she stretched out her hand after Rod and Chris left like she wanted her old life back after she realized she was going to die, maybe it was a realization that everything that they believed in was wrong as well. 

I sorta think the son and daughter might have been somewhat hypnotized to conform to the family because of how robotic some of their actions were (Jeremy instantly stopping after the mother tells him to at the dinner table) and Rose transformation into female terminator. Granted it also could have just been regular brain washing from a young age. 

Overall very solid 8.5 or 9/10 film.

I appreciate the risks the movie takes, like having those fantastical, metaphorical,  drifting off into nothing shots.

The backyard scene during the party felt so real. As a black guy working in a very white area of the city, these microagressions ( saying bro, fist bumping. Black Impressionism) is an everyday thing...not bc my coworkers and clients are racist, but that we just culturally are so different at ones that it can become awkward.

de8x2e4,"I really loved this movie but I had two nit-picky problems.

1. When Rod goes to the police, he brings in a lot of evidence to show something was wrong (sure he had a fairly insane theory but his info was solid). The most glaring one was he had a picture of a man that they knew who disappeared for six months and was found in this community as a completely different person. Now if it was a white cop being told this, I could MAYBE understand the hand-waving away part of it, but the cop was black. I would think the police would have some questions for a man who was officially reported missing for six months.

2. When Rod was talking to Rose about Chris' disappearance and he tries to record their conversation, she somehow magically knows that he is recording their conversation where she enacts a insanely scripted story about his attraction to her. Was she psychic or something?",5vv1qh

- Anyone a but bummed that the skeleton deer from the trailer never showed up in the movie? It was the coolest part of the trailer, and must be some weird dream sequence Chris has, but it was nowhere to be found. 

- The explanation how flash photography pulls you out of their control wasn't really needed. If that's the case, how can these people guarantee going out in public without getting triggered? People taking selfies, lightning, someone flashing the lights in a room on and off?

- How the hell was Chris so chill about getting stabbed through the hand by Missy?

- Interesting how when Chris was strangling Rose, she started to smile creepily which made him stop. Any idea what that was about?

- Speaking of Rose, she was weirdly chill with her family dead and her house burning down, and was hunting down Chris with no emotion whatsoever. Also, she sure has to do a hell of a lot of work, dating all these guys for months to lure back home. She seems like the most messed up out of the entire family.

Also, I know it seems like Rose was doing damage control by coming onto Rod during their last phone call, but was this part of her plan the whole time? When they're driving out, she asks to speak to Rod, and then proceeds to mildly flirt with him. He initiates it, but after that's over, she just lets Chris take him off speaker, as if she had gotten everything she needed out of the conversation.

I swear at some point when the grandfather on that tape in the basement talked about the procedure, he said he'd perfected the technique, which was the reason the grandfather passed it down to the father to perform on people like Chris and Andre.

But to me, it didn't really seem that ""perfected"". Every interaction with the grandparents/Andre seems like they didn't really have proper control over the bodies. Why did they keep going through all this effort to do the transplants when it clearly wasn't that perfect?

I mean, the theory we settled on was that the -grandfather- had perfected it, but when teaching the father, he couldn't exactly teach the fine art it took to perform the transplant, which is why any of the ones done by the father left the motor functions much more impaired.

The movie, as a whole, was definitely much more than I thought it would be. Peele was able to get across a lot of the injustices that we have in society. Many people understand overt racism and there are many movies about it....but in this age, many (non-Black) people don't realize that they still can be racist without wanting to commit acts of physical violence against Black people. 

Me and my boyfriend (I am Black and he is not Black but he is of color) still felt that a lot of what the white people in the movie did resonated with similar instances we had. The humor in the white people saying things like ""I would have voted for Obama a third time"" or their ""appreciation"" for Black athletes and black bodies...it was funny because those are things that white people have said to us in attempt to show solidarity but it fails because above all, they still maintain their privilege.

I would say this is and is not a horror film. It is massively tense, but not in the usual ways. This movie uses its acting, dialogue and sound to build a constant sense of dread with discomfort and uncertainty. The music does an outstanding job of building an atmosphere that is almost unbearable at times.

But it's also hilarious. It's actually kind of incredible how this movie uses its humor to break the tension. It's damn effective and serves as a much-needed relief, but never overstays it's welcome.

But i also feel this movie is acutely emotional, and it's in this way that the writing and acting really feel special. Lots of movies try to get me to feel what the main character is feeling, but this is the first one that I felt really forces me into his shoes. It's so easy to empathize with him. I felt all of the worry, dread, confusion, horror, and sadness that he felt. It's overwhelming at times. I cried at some parts, which doesn't happen often for me.


TL;DR: When it's scary, it's horrifying, when it's funny, it's hilarious, but when it pulls at your emotions, it wrenches them in the best ways. It's great on all fronts.

That said, I feel some of the scenes could have been mindblowing with less music. Take the hypnosis scene, remove the violins. She says something, he says something, he starts crying, with dead silence. Another scene: the one where Georgina is whispering ""No, no, no, no."" I didn't anticipate anything in those scenes because of the music. I think he should've let it rely more on the actors talent and chemistry, which was very apparent.

That said though, the ""Give me the keys"" scene was fantastic, and reminded me of the road scene in 'Nocturnal Animals.'

I don't like horror movies but I went to see it because of all the good reviews and it definitely lived up to my expectations.

I am wondering what was up with Tanaka though, was he actually himself, partaking in the auction and all? I missed the first half of his line when he asks Chris about the African American experience so maybe the movie made it clear he was with them or not - if former I don't know what Peele's intentions were, is the Asian guy part of the whole oppress and enslave black people shindig? Some comments here say that it shows that it wasn't about kidnapping solely black people, but people with good, desirable physical abilities etc, but the movie made it pretty clear it was about racism, so I don't know, it was uncomfortable for me to see that the Asian guy, who is also the only non-black PoC role in the movie, is on the perpetrators' side.

Other than that I thought Peele did a great job of setting up the whole story from start to end, and I really liked Rod here haha especially at the end when he comes to rescue in his TSA car.",5vv1qh

Why take it so far as to have Rose even pretending still to be on his side after the entire rest of the family have revealed themselves to be a threat, all the way to his escape attempt?

Right now the only explanation I can think of is they (or maybe Rose and they indulge her) simply enjoy toying with him, but the show movie doesn't seem to set them up as people who get their rocks off on what they're doing, they just think of it as business, black people are just resources.",5vv1qh

2. Rose smiles before the cops show up at the end. Why is she smiling?

3. The car and knight mask at the beginning and end are the same (yes I'm sure most caught that, but I did not)

4. When Georgina approaches Chris about the phone, the whole thing seems weird. Wouldn't it be easier to have Rose say ""huh. She must have knocked it off the desk when she was cleaning. She used to do that a lot to me.""

Could it be that the ""little piece of you that still remains"" was Georgina trying to leave Chris clues as to what's going on?

Jason Blum – who produced the film via Blumhouse Films – loves a sequel. And with Get Out making a mint at the box office, we asked Peele if a follow-up was being discussed. “That’s a long conversation,” came the response. “I would never do a sequel without figuring out how to make it as good. Or better. Which might be hard. I’m a fan of what James Cameron does with sequels, where you get all the fun of the original, plus an entirely new element to the fun. So it’s not out of the question, but I’m definitely going to respect the response to the original, and not do a sequel just for a sequel’s sake.”

But what of Chris and Rod, who are making their escape when the film ends. If there’s no sequel, will they be OK? “That’s a good question. There’s a lot of unanswered questions. Is Rose really dead? Can someone save Andre? These are all the questions that people are asking me online [regarding a sequel]. I’d definitely look to satisfy people go on and write a thesis on it.  if there were one…”

He's choking her for about 20 seconds and doesn't kill her and then she smiles and Chris lets go.
I was thinking he just couldn't kill her because he loved her, but it just came off very awkward to me and seems like there's more to understand.

If is it safe to assume he was on the phone to rose and she had lured him into a random neighbourhood so her brother could grab him? It confused me because we clearly see this auction party is an annual thing so why grab this victim in such a risky random way when they clearly have a very well done, well practised way of starting their process (inviting the victim into their isolated home). from the film I get the idea that rose invites her boyfriend/girlfriend to the party each year but maybe that's not the case and the guy at the beginning was just another way they have got ahold of their victim. Although the whole process does seem very calculated and practiced. 
So yeah any thoughts on the beginning? Is the whole situation of inviting the guy to the party just a one time thing and some times they grab the victim from the streets? Or was there something I missed ",5vv1qh

1) Why did Rose bother dating these guys for months before inviting them to her parents? Wouldn't it have been more efficient to drug someone or pick them up in a bar and take them home?

de85kuh,"I don't know the direct quote from the movie, but I think the best summarizing quote would be when one of the white liberals says something along the lines of ""black is the new cool."" This line just really hit the nail on the head, as far as getting across the racism within white liberal culture. Just as shown in Atlanta's Juneteenth, racism extends beyond racist aggression. Many of us find fascinations with many subcultures within the realms of music, movies, and art, and white liberals are portrayed to treat black people in the same way. Racism is a subdivision of bias and prejudice, focusing on cultural separation rather than just simply an anger toward the other race. I think this is the warning that the movie tries to make though: even though ""black"" is the new fad, fad's are only temporary. When the fad fades, the cultural separation will still be there, and there is still opportunity for aggression (as shown when Bradley Whitford's character talks about exterminating deer).",5vv1qh

The story is quite unique in the way it is told and I really liked the acting of basically every actor. Unfortunately I saw it dubbed, so I guess in original version it is even better.
There are some things that bother me though: [spoilers!]

For me the TSA friend killed a lot of the atmosphere. First he explains the plot for the audience in telling the protagonist that those white people hypnotize black people to keep them as (sex)slaves. People would have figured that out sooner or later themselves, there is no need to explain that so obviously. 
Secondly, the tension after the protagonist is captured is taken away through the investigations of the TSA friend. Of course it was funny to see him struggle to explain his theory to the police, but I was more interested in feeling the tension of the hopeless situation the protagonist was in. This whole comic relief thing would not have been needed in my opinion.
The ending was okay, I did not expect it exactly like that, but it was a rather standard ending for a horror movie lately with the main character escaping and every bad guy dead. I would have liked something different since the rest of the movie tried to go another way. [/spoilers]

Just my 2 cents. ",5vv1qh
dek1tkl,"There are subtle signs about the tragic life of the Armitage family. I think thats where some of the most underrated social commentary comes from as well. 
 
Dean grew up his entire life focused on how to turn white people into black people. The irony/sadness for him is that he's still willing to always throw jabs at black people. Thats his inner turmoil spending his entire life trying to fulfill his father's dreams. The ""he almost got over it line"" is chilling foreshadowing. Yet throughout this entire tour of his home his dislike of black people emerges. The deer references, the black mold, Obama stuff. Just like some racists can acknowledge your gifts, but don't see or value the person. Thats Dean. 


There is a sadness with Missy as well. Twisted, but its there. The devoted mother who is in charge of bringing up the deepest fears of prey. Yet she has this weary vibe about her. Like is this all her life has become. You see a hint of that on her face during the auction. 

Now look at the children. 

Jeremy is a flat out psycho. He is nothing but the muscle. However, that stems from two generations of family feeding him the idea that he's inferior. He displays all his insecurities in the presence of Chris. Even after they fight he's told he's not good enough to beat him. At the dinner table and during the auction there's this sick and sad jealousy of not being able to become Chris. This is where it could be subversive. Usually the depicted racist son just feels full superiority. Here there is some self doubt. 

Then there is Rose. The Time of Your Life bit is the irony of woman who doesn't display real happiness at all. Yet this is what she grew up to know. Always looking for her next victim. This is her role in the family and this is the only good thing she can provide. Her entire life is  built upon the ability to ""act"". She's the worst of them all. The evil reality tv esque daughter who has no real connection to the world or to society. 

Not even got to grandpa and grandma yet.

Sure, a lot, if not all, of the horror ""techniques and methods"" that Peele uses are derivative, but come on, race issues aside, the concept is really well thought out and executed. 

The way race gets brought in, Peele really holds back a lot of what he COULD have done as far as shoving Black Lives Matter etc down everyone's throats. But let's be real, the way it is, the film's premise doesn't work any other way. Black people ought to be, at the very least, semi-uncomfortable around masses of white people given today's modern context. If you don't get why, gtfo because you're being ignorant. 

Peele uses an original idea and turns it into gold on the big screen. I already miss his comedy though :*(",5vv1qh
de6usno,"This movie is phenomenal! 

Jordan Peele did a great job telling a horror story revolving around cultural appropriation and interracial relations. The film also has a good message concerning friends. Each actor did a great job portraying their character. Allison Williams felt robotic at times but that's because of the directing she's receiving. I wished more time was spent on the Armitage family to flesh out their characters though. It more or less appeared that they too were either hypnotized or coerced into kidnapping black people for their devious deeds. The climax was very ironic as Chris could have been perceived as the movie's villain. As a black guy, Chris' story would had ended much earlier had the surviving Armitage's had simply called the police. The Dahmer reference highlighted that much. Lil Rel Howery's character, Rod, is probably my favorite one of the movie. He kept Chris grounded and ultimately made a move against all odds that saved Chris' life. 

This movie deserves its current 100% approval on RT. I highly suggest seeing it twice as many clues would be even more apparent on a second viewing. Peele did an awesome job and I hope the Academy recognizes this in 2018. Go see this film!

Notes:

* Many are probably reconsidering interracial dating after seeing this film. 
* Jordan Peele is biracial 
* The first scene was definitely a cut from Donald Glover's Atlanta. Ever wondered what happened to Darius when he was not around? Now you know
* The audience in my theater applauded when Lil Rel Howery's character showed up in that scene

My favorite out of left field thing about this movie was the very obvious love for Rosemary's Baby Peele has, this movie was oozing with it...all the way down to one of the old white dudes being names Roman.

[I'm normally a stickler when it comes to authenticity in movies. So when the main character was a photographer, I thought how is going to handle the camera to convince us?.

The lacrosse stick also caught my eye. I played from elementary school to college. I spotted the tape job on the buttend to shorten the feel of the stick and custom shooting string setup (not store strung).](#spoiler)

1) How did Rod actually find him in the end? I know there was the TSA joke, but just wondering if I missed anything earlier in the movie indicating he could actually track down Chris's location.

2) Chris watches the video in the basement explaining the whole plan - but when he escapes to the kitchen and sees Grandma/The Maid run out of the kitchen in a panic - why does he let her go? At that point shouldn't he know by her behavior that her body must be possessed by an older white person? The safe bet would have been to kill her as soon as he saw her as well.",5vv1qh

Does that mean that it was Rose who did it? Can't remember if I saw that correctly.

The husband that is inhabiting Andre's body seems to start to convey that he doesn't understand what is happening to him- he says things like ""Even when you go away I just don't seem to want to leave"" and ""chores seem to be my life.""

Why would a man who is basically a rich white man who's been given a second chance at life in a healthy body be being treated like this by his wife? Why, even before the flash breaks his hypnosis, do both parts of that guy's body seem to be having a terrible time? Shouldn't he be just acting like a happy husband? I mean even when Chris doesn't know whats going on he accepts that this guy is married to the woman, so its not like he needs to pretend to be a servant or something- it seems like a genuine confusion that he is spending his life in captivity, unable to leave the house and being made to do chores.

What is the purpose of her taking the time to put the pictures in frames and hang them like beloved memories?  Is it just a creepy scene or is there a reason behind it? 

They spent the whole movie trying to appear normal but at the end she publicly displays all her boyfriends and Georgina.  

Does she do this to 2 boyfriends a year?  Her and Chris were together for 5 months, so I’m guessing she must do this at least once or twice a year.

ix6gkpm,"Just finished watching this for first time. Enjoyed the many layers and symbols to it. A few observations:

* Fascinated by the predator/prey theme throughout , the lion teddy bear facing Chris when he's trying to relax in bed which he constantly turns away from him. Roses 'trophy hunting' so to speak with the 'victories' in pictures over her bed. Her clothing changes from casual to old style hunting gear (white buttoned shirt, beige trousers, hair tied up, rifle). Also how at the start she seemed slightly grossed out and annoyed when relaying to her parents that a deer hit her car, rather than sad that the deer died.
* When Chris is in the garden at night and Walter runs towards him, he looks to the house and sees Georgina who also catches Walter out the corner of her eye but she looks rather unphased. I'm guessing she is used to his running/attempting to beat records so this unusual looking activity is blase to her.
* Not 100% sure on these but some thoughts:

When the art dealer mentioned how he goes about getting art he says he has an assistant who he trusts to scope it all out - maybe the assistant is Rose. Art having a double meaning in that she is scoping out suitable 'hosts/bodies/men'.

\- Silver spoon in a china teacup being what triggers hypnosis - symbolism for white privilege (born with silver spoon in mouth, fine china etc)  
\- Golf man ignores Chris when Chris states he is into basketball rather than golf. Asks him shortly after what his golf swing is like. Could be relating to how he sees Chris as a commodity/vessel rather than an actual individual.",5vv1qh

The dad being a neuroscientist, the mom being a hypnotist made that pretty apparent early on. I wouldn't necessarily say that's a bad thing but it was something I called very early on. A little Easter egg I loved was that the coagulation procedure was made after the grandpa experienced the physical prowess of Jesse Owens at the 1936 olympics. That was a very nice touch. The ending was fantastic, and the overall mood of the film made you feel like something was going to go wrong for the protagonist at the end but it didn't happen which was a unique twist for me. The jump scares were done very well, always showing up at times where you never expected them to happen. I've seen it twice and the jump scares are still so off beat and random that all of them made me jump even during the second viewing. Reminds me of the pawn shop scene in Drive where Standard gets shot, the shot happens so unrhythemically with the scene that it makes you jump no matter how many times you've seen it or how much you're anticipating it. On top of that, the representation of sleep paralysis, something I've experienced myself, is spot on.

And even if it was an option why would you do it in camera when you can use photoshop or lightroom that gives you so much more freedom to adjust your image. He could have transfered a already edited picture back to the SD card and that way being able to se the picture in black and white but that would be fucking stupid.,5vv1qh

I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but damn this movie blew me away. I would say around the middle it felt kind of slow, but not slow enough to hurt the tension, and it was very tense. I went in under the impression that it was a horror movie, but I would say it's much more of a thriller, and a damn good one. Tense, psychological, and even really funny. The whole race aspect was actually interesting, and any sort of racial message that can be gleamed from it didn't at all distract from the actual content of the movie. In fact I would say that the racial aspect actually made it better, with an interesting duality of both fighting and embracing black stereotypes, particularly with the friend character who was very cliche black funny, it was all pulled off very well. It's also nice to have a thriller/horror character who isn't a complete idiot.",5vv1qh

All feature a [secret society of rich folk exploiting innocent bystanders for different reasons](#spoiler). Though the premise of the movie is more analogous to Martyrs, the tonality felt very reminiscent of Hostel from the moment they got to the family house.

The only thing I'm not entirely sold on is the methodology of the whole operation. Like, is having a 4-month relationship with (I assume) each guy really the most effective use of the girl's time? Was it even necessary? The blind guy even says that Chris is one of the lucky ones, compared to her brother's more simple albeit brutal maim-and-grab approach. Surely, there are easier, less time-consuming ways of acquiring fresh blood, right?

While we're at it, the moment the brother arrived at the house, they could've incapacitated Chris. Shit, probably even sooner if Grandpa helped. Why the whole party ordeal? I'm guessing all of it is because they wanted to show Chris' personality to the bidders, not just his physical aptitude. In which case, why are some folks just straight-up kidnapped then? Maybe different clients are looking for different things? Anyway, just my 2 cents.

 Colors they used were pretty decent, I liked how the film was shot from an aesthetic stand point. I kind of wish they fleshed out the Parents and their motivations a bit more instead of them being simply ""bad guys"". The lead Daniel Kaluuya also did a great job of showing vulnerability during his hypnosis scenes. 

TSA Friend (aka Rod) was fucking spectacular on his Comedic Timing. Wish they fleshed out the part where he talks to the police a bit more with more serious dialog or at Tarantino-esque small talk, I felt like they could have milked a lot more laughs in that scene. 

I didn't like the Creepy brother. I get it, that they wanna show a weasly creepy white dude (mawfucka looked like Blake Henderson on meth)  but cmon, that character was just shoved in there.

Are they going to be able to convince everyone of the truth and get the rest of the kooks handled? 

There were just a lot of questions I wanted answered and they never came. But, on the flip side, maybe that sets it up for a sequel? I don't know, I'm not sure how that would work really, but I'd watch it lol. 

Definitely loved all the twists though, I was constantly being pleasantly surprised. I did think the fact that the mom was hypnotizing all the other black people was very obvious, but I wasn't expecting the reason why they were doing it or stuff like the other two ""servants"" being family, etc. It was just great, especially since the whole time you're just thinking how racist all these people must be.

I really wanted to look at this movie completely objectively, but I can't because I keep thinking about how it was written from a black perspective, and Jordan Peele knew what he was doing.

Does her brother also pitch in? I doubt it lol. I love how Rose's parents know she's pretty and can snatch up any black man she wants like that.

Also, how realistic is it for Rose to masquerade a relationship for 4-5 months like that? She would have to really invest herself into the relationship to convince the other person that she's committed. This includes a lot sex, a lot of dates, going out with friends, and long conversations: realistically, there's a good chance she could accidentally fall in love with one of her targets and turn on her parents - but then after all that, just to flip a switch like that and turn on your ""partner"" in whom you've invested so much time - you'd have to be completely void of a conscious.

The reasoning of the Armitage family to use black people just didn't feel strong enough. Like, racist people *don't want to be black.* If anything, they'd get other white people and take over their bodies. 

I was hoping that there'd be a deeper message than the two that I felt like the movie were pushing about race:

- White people tokening black people and treating them as their skin color rather than as complex human beings

- White people fetishizing black traits

debb89l,"Saw this movie yesterday, and overall really enjoyed it. Probably haven't enjoyed a thriller this much in a while. That being said, I did have some nitpicks. Mostly with the ending. Some random thoughts, both positive, negative, and in between. 

1. The whole transplantation thing makes sense from a logical standpoint, but I almost think it would have been more effective if the core conceit had just been about the white people trying to make the black people ""better."" I was getting a very ""Stepford Wives with black people"" vibe until that point, and the transplantation thing just threw all that out the window. It might just be a case of unrealized expectations on my part though. 

2. The comedy was actually a very effective breath of fresh air that I think was needed, given how heavy the subject matter was. 

3. I was REALLY hoping that Rose wasn't in on it, and that she was being hypnotized to bring more black people in. So that was disappointing, but ultimately understandable. 

4. I did really like the little glimpses of the ""original"" personalities that came through. Some top notch acting there, especially from Georgina.

deuh93p,"I'm definitely in the minority with what I thought of Get Out. Personally, I don't think it should have received a 99% on Rotten Tomatoes. Here's why I think this. Had the movie ended on a point of ambiguity and not revealed the information especially of grandpa and grandma, the message would have been much stronger. However, because I know that the two elders desired to become black, it does detract from the racial tension motif that Jordan Peele hammers in so well. If I was one of the white people in the movie, wouldn't I not want to be white? Everything except the one line of ""black is in"" suggests that the white people in the film still very much sees black people as specimens, or even pets. Perhaps the point of the movie is to show how overt racism has transformed into a complex dynamic between the two groups, but it can't hit home for me because of the family's desire to transplant themselves into black bodies as the movie doesn't cultivate this idea enough. I think that much of the message only involves portraying this stereotypical racism in modern America. 

Here is my second reason. The 99% that rotten tomatoes gives to this movie is very ironic. When I see some of the reviews left by credits I feel that I'm just watching the movie again and hearing the line ""I would vote for obama for a third term if i can"". I heard recently in a NPR interview with Jordan Peele that he specifically made this film to address the minority audience. And much of the comedic scenes in the film assembles very similarly to other black comedies. Black comedies tend to land at the point of being practical, we see this often in the joke ""white people are crazy"". And typically, the black humor does not land well with critics (look at all of the Madea movies). Comedic scenes from Get Out resemble many other black comedies. I just find it ironic how when the movie attempts a serious conversation as race, it is immediately praised as a master piece. But if taken out of context and the reviews had little to no ramifications, would the same ratings be given?

99%.. come on rotten tomatoes :/",5vv1qh

de6xxou,"Very fun movie to watch but there were a few issues and plot holes that I had problems with.

 -  Why would the old white people all want to be black for their next body? This movie clearly was trying to push a social narrative that black people are still a disenfranchised minority which is true, in this country and in basically every country in the world it is better to be white. So to keep their immortality functioning why wouldn't they just transfer their minds to young, healthy white people instead?

 - How come once the people's consciousness transfers, they still remain servants and basically slaves? It made for a cool plot twist but it's a huge inconsistency because if the grandparents had transferred into the bodies of the black man and woman then why are they still doing slave labor?

 - I absolutely detested the ""twist"" with Allison being in on the whole thing. Not only did it firmly set every white person in the film as a villain, it was only surprising only because it was so unbelievable. Her ""method"" of luring guys is so laughably inefficient. If her goal is just to draw in young black men then a beautiful girl like her could just go to any bar, talk up a young black man, bring him home and drug him or something. Instead she draws out a long, steady relationship for presumably a few months just to get one guy when she could easily nab one or more guys per night?

 - How did Chris use his cellphone light at the very end of the black man/grandfather if his phone was out of battery?

de8038u,"I'm just gonna go ahead and just go on a rant (I guess you could call it that). Sorry for the paragraphs that will ensue.

I saw Get Out today and I'd rate it a 5.5/10. As a black man watching this movie felt like listening to that preachy old dude who'd always say shit like: ""O' dontchu go fuckin' 'round wit dem white girls now! First dey git'cha wit da white goil and dem dey be brain washing ya n' shit, gotchu actin' like one of them!"". The movie had a lot of brilliant things going on with it's writing, cinematography, and symbolism but I feel despite it's enticing concept it's execution left much to be desired. 

Racism, pandering, controversy and all that shit aside, I feel how the white people acted in this movie was poorly done for the most part. It took me out of it. There was practically no subtlety with how they acted and they basically were the most stereotypical evil plantation owning white people I have ever seen. The scenes in which he was introduced to the family and the other guests made me cringe very hard.  Their painfully awkward behavior coupled with the obviously [mind controlled slaves](#spoiler) made watching a lot of the movie hard. Don't get me wrong though, the actors' performances were great. But they were given shit to work with. With the straight forward introduction of [hypnotism](#spoiler) you pretty much immediately knew what was going to happen the moment the ""unexpected event"" happened. 

Speaking of predictability, let's talk about the main character. I feel that Peele wanted to differentiate himself from other horror films by having a protagonist that is very aware of his situation and capable of not falling for the most typical of horror movie protagonist errors. In certain scenes I feel he did that very well. Chris's character was an odd mix of being what I stated previously and also ironically falling within the said horror movie tropes. One moment the guy is wandering into dark rooms with doors hanging open, then next he is capable of pulling a MacGyver tier escape plan. It was weird watching him go from being a realistically aware protagonist to a generic overly curious idiot back and forth and in repetition for the whole movie. A scene that especially pissed me the fuck off was when [he was looking through the photos in the cupboard and putting the pieces together that his girlfriend was in on it the whole time. You can see in his expression when looking at in shots right after that he is paranoid of her. Yet for some reason once he gets downstairs he all of a sudden forgets those incriminating photos and lets her take possession of the keys and yells at her like a moron for a couple of minutes.](#spoiler) It was like they wanted to have an intelligent protagonist, but realized by doing so he probably would have caught on to all this far faster. So they just kinda changed their mind and just had him be oblivious again going down the stairs. It was really fucking frustrating to watch this protagonist put the pieces together with all the crazy shit going on, and for some reason do absolutely jack shit about it up until then very end where it was practically too late. This movie seemed to do that a lot though. It would take one step forward with it's writing and then take two steps back for no reason. 

I ragged on this movie a bit, so I'll talk about things that I really did like. One of the simpler things that everyone will notice is that this movie looked good. It looked very good. A great amount of the angles, shots, and lighting of the movie were really well done and complimented the ever shifting tone of this movie greatly. Surprisingly enough as well I found the movie's jumpscares to actually be well timed and effective (which is something that is seldom rarely ever said about modern horror movies), [with the exception of one scene where the maid walks behind Chris and the movie plays the overused shitty ringing noise.](#spoiler) Another amazing thing about this movie was how much detail was put into it. [The usage of the main character's backstory, the father's rant on the deer, the girlfriend not letting Chris give his identity to the cop, etc.](#spoiler) A lot of this small yet effectiveness touches to the movie really blew me away, and made me wonder what other guy wrote the rest of the movie. 

All in all I *(kinda)* liked the movie, but it really dropped the ball in a lot of it's scenes and I feel it could have been much better.",5vv1qh
de8nv2s,"It was an okay movie, but it's not as good as rottentomatoes reviews would have you believe.  It's got a lot of flaws, and okay I hate to be this guy, but I have to: Some reviewers have got to be afraid to be critical of a movie mostly about racism.

That is my main gripe.  It overstates the problem, uses it as a catalyst for an eventual scene where several white people are brutally killed (justifiable given the circumstances, but the circumstances are just so far out there that it made me uncomfortable).

Consider that there's lots of people out there with persecution complexes.  This movie sort of eggs them on.  Yeah, that white bitch is hypnotizing you, and your girlfriend is really plotting against you.  

Here's some major non-racial things that a lot of reviewers are overlooking:

1. The way the transplanted people behave.  It's a cheap ploy to keep us all believing that they've just been hypnotized.  If all these rich people saw that after they were put in someone else that they'd act so freakin weird and zombie like, I kind of doubt this procedure would take off.

2.  Chris just overlooks too many obvious things.  This leads him down a pretty predictable road until the very end when suddenly he gets an idea and everything just gets resolved within a couple minutes.

3.  I know the TSA stuff was supposed to be funny, but it just fell flat.  Some other parts of the movie, I don't think were meant to be funny, like audience reaction to Chris finding pics of his girlfriend with a bunch of other black guys.

4.  Chris's backstory with his mom doesn't seem to play a mechanical role in anything that actually happens.  I suppose one could say the mom uses it against him or some crap, but see five for my thoughts on what makes that irrelevant.

5.  Forced hypnosis. Come on bro, come on.  It's not happening, and at this early point in the movie it jarred me fully out of liking the film.  It irrevocably ruined a little bit of it for me, because it was so stupid.  And in the end, it turns out to be mostly irrelevant since hypnosis wasn't the end goal.

Okay a little back to the racial side of things.  I know how this is going to come off, but seriously it was a little offensive.  A white girl on a laptop binging (notice all the MS product placement?) NCAA top prospects to hunt for her next boyfriend.  Sure, that's not supposed to be surprising, but the way it's shot it's a joke, it's meant for laughs, as if we are somehow capturing a segment of the white girl population to tease them for some sort of black guy obsession.   People were laughing, so I think it's safe to say I'm not reading too much into what was being done there.

I've heard that this was partially a movie about cultural appropriation.  If that's the case, then it's even sadder, because CA as a concept is flawed, especially regarding America and its subcultures.  

Here's why.  In other cultures, those long established with histories dating back centuries, there's ceremony, and costumes, and traditions, and belief systems.  In America, the concept of CA became a matter of adopting mannerisms, ways of speaking, and ways of dressing.  All things that ultimately everyone chooses.  It's not a matter of religious ferver, it's not genetics, and there's little solid support that it's a matter of income or education level.  Everyone gets to choose these things, because liberty allows it in this country and other democracies.  It's not what used to be known as culture.  The word itself has shifted to include these things, and that has happened because a people that were displaced by slavery yearn for self-identity separate from the race of their former... long long former, dead, masters (of their long long dead ancestors).

A flaw the movie makes regarding this concept, outside of acknowleding its existence, is pretending it's a new thing.  One of the patrons says ""being black is in fashion"", and an asian man asks Chris if being black has been beneficial, as if everyone suddenly thinks being black is great.  I've never met anyone that thought that.  I've seen a couple stupid conservative talking heads or radio show guys assert something like that, but that's really rare, and not the same thing as thinking things like AA are unhelpful.

The truth is, CA has been around and documents in America for almost a century now.  It's not new, it's certainly not worse than it was in certain decades where Jazz took hold and then blues, and then hip-hop.  We aren't in one of those periods now.

So TL:DR, I feel that the way the subject of race is handled in the movie is poor, a little unfair, and at times offensive, if not a little sexist at the same time.

By the end of the movie, the entire audience at once is hoping that the police car isn't the white cop from the beginning of the film, because we know with the bloody scene around the lead character, he'll probably be shot by the cop who unfairly asked him for his license.](#spoiler)",5vv1qh

deakawn,"The movie was amazing. I saw it yesterday and I was physically squirming at every twist and turn. One thing that stood out to me after - In the scene where Chris and Rose are the party and the old white woman is sizing him up, she's checking to see how useful he can be in bed for her. It didn't occur to me at the time because we didn't know about the consciousness transfer but her old husband was in a wheel chair and if they won him at the auction, they would swap minds with the husband. Her husband would be living through Chris and she'd use his body - omg! How sick. 

I didn't get why the grandparents would live as servants. Where they just pretending for when Chris was there?

The whole mind swap thing was unexpected. Cool but it would make more sense if they were just using them as slaves. 


Shit, when he found the pictures of Rose with the other black people, it fucked me UP! That was probably the craziest twist. The way she just changed up on him when she refused to give him the keys - terrifying. Such an excellent movie.

It shows you how racism really looks in a way that the laaaaaaaarge majority of people never notice. I'm half Egyptian, not black, but I can definitely relate to the main character when he was at the family lunch in the garden. The way race affects day-to-day life is usually through people projecting preconceived judgements onto you. That was so cleverly shown when the main character was confronted with stupid ass questions and comments about how physically gifted he is.  They captured this complex idea that a lot of people have about how not to be racist. ""Oh well, if I only assume the good stereotypes are true, and the bad are wrong, then I'm not racist.""

And that makes him (unconsciously?) super racist because he can't imagine it's something about Chris' mind that makes him good at photography, it's gotta be a physical thing. Like, if Chris was white the art dealer would be like ""Oh well even if I put my brain in his body I won't be able to take amazing photography because my mind doesn't work like his (and his is gone)"" but because Chris is black he can't imagine it's a mind thing, right?

Was not scary at all unfortunately. I believe the trailers completely misrepresented this movie. There were too many comedic elements to ever get into a sense of horror or suspense. Every time some tension was built up there would be some disarming comedic overtone that ruined the mood.

It was a decent movie but definitely not a horror or suspense thriller which I thought it was going to be.

I also believe the ending was very abrupt and it left the final scene feeling like the end of a sketch rather than an actual movie. They crammed so much in it was as if the writer sort of painted himself into a corner and wanted to wrap everything up quickly.

de54fdn,"The metaphorical pay-off on this film is genuinely brilliant. Aside from the wonderfully body-horror nature of it all, it really hits deep on certain cultural issues. That sense that no matter how politely white people speak of or to black people, they fundamentally don't value them as individuals or real people. That they have a bizarre pseudo-admiration of the way black people are - or appear to be - as 'exotic' or 'powerful'. It really hits hard, and keeps turning over deeper thoughts as you chew on it. 

I was also very impressed with the way Jordan Peele tackled various tropes and details that are kind of integral to horror films. He demonstrated both the fans deep knowing and insight, and the professionals attention to detail. The phone, for example; phones are a big issue in modern horror films because they tend to blunt the danger by providing immediate and obvious resources. Here, he deliberately took that on, first by making a sly point about having it 'charged', and then by allowing his character to use it, to call for help, and explain his situation, only to have that reversed on him by his 'helper' not being taken seriously because of how incredible the story was. Then, to also utilize it as his 'checkov's gun' was also brilliant. I *almost* didn't see it until it was too late!

And then there was his response to that dehumanizing of the black character, by having him survive and escape purely on the strength of his wits. Using the cotton, and opening the door to bait his attackers leg up so he could hit it with the spoon were both purely intellectual moments. 

Final thought, the thematic depth of the deer motifs was also really brilliantly realized. Foreshadowing his mother, establishing blacks as deer (vermin!) and then the big trophy buck to show off with, and finally using that buck to claim revenge. It was all so well developed and well executed. 

I think I could really talk about this film for hours. I don't know if it's *quite* a masterpiece, but for a (technically) first feature it was incredibly poised. It might be light on scares, but it Peele knows his stuff and this is a really great addition to the genre.",5vv1qh

I don't like how you can pretty  much infer the general plot of the movie from the trailer or the first 10 minutes (whichever you watched first). Black man meets girlfriend's creepy white family at their isolated home, then realizes he needs to Get Out. (Gosh, I wonder if these odd white people are going to turn out to be evil?)

Rose: (somewhat jokingly) So I'm getting some racial flow here, right?
Chris: Yeah, racial flow, haha.

df5rdlh,"Saw it a couple weekends ago. I have lots of thoughts, but it's late so I wanted to leave just one here. I semi-jokingly said that the reason the reveal with the keys when Rose whips them out wasn't as tense, is because even as a girl who carries a messy, huge purse, there are two things I ALWAYS can grab immediately: my phone, and my keys. There's not NEAR that much, if any, fumbling around all helpless. Perhaps because I'm just cynical, perhaps because they already had revealed she was pretty much in on it, but the ""fumbling can't find my keys"" seemed very fake on her part, so the part downstairs was creepy but not a ""shocker"" like it was for other people I've talked to about it. 

Since we already saw the creepy photos of Rose with Georgina and the other victims, I was already like, ""Oh, shit,"" but as soon as she plops her purse on the ground and starts fumbling, I was like, ""No, girl. That's not how this works.""

Like I said, I was half-joking, but the girls I know who have seen the movie said the same thing once I brought it up. Especially if you're in a situation where you think you need to leave like RIGHT AWAY, you want to make sure your keys are like, in-hand and ready to go.

deaa9qx,"Firstly, I want to qualify that I really did enjoy the film.  The tl;dr for me would be excellent first 2/3 of the film but disappointing finale, around a 7/10.  However, there are a couple of large flaws that I really can't help but feel a need to air and perhaps get some outside perspectives to perhaps change my views.  

Perhaps the largest was that this wasn't a horror film at all! This film hardly had more than a few scares, which was really unfortunate, as the premise was so damn amazing.  Jordan Peele really built an atmospheric, eerie set-up with excellent shot selection (that first scene pulling up to the parent's house with that beautiful wideshot and letting the score hang was just poetry in motion for a horror film).  I thought the microagressions were so well written in retrospect to the finale (Good lord, the golf swing/""I've met Tiger Woods"" lines were absolute gold and great crowd pleasers) and I really enjoyed that the film can MOSTLY be re-watched on a second viewing with the ending in mind and make complete sense. It doesn't betray its premise and handles the racial tensions perfectly. 

 But, let's be real, all the real horror elements of the film were ruined by the trailer! Scary gardener running towards our main protagonist? Creepy houselady having a freakout in the window and confronting our main protagonist? Hypnosis/""sink into the floor?"" Secondary/false-flag black character freaking out after taking a picture of him? My god, the only thing missing was the hallway sequence with Georgina, the intro to the film, and the last 1/3 of the film, which hardly had a single scare.  If either the trailer hadn't include as much of the ""scare"" tactics, or rather had focused on a more suspense/thriller aspect of the film, I might have been okay with how the end product worked.  

However, I can forgive all of that if the final 1/3 of the film had a fantastic horror/thrill payoff. And my goodness, this is where the film lost me.  Everything resolved SO. DAMN. QUICKLY.  The laughs were absolutely perfect (Googling NCAA basketball prospects? My fucking sides), but every ""face-off"" ended so quickly and weren't true to the characters they had developed. Creepy, psychotic ""brother"" with the promise of a true fight? No, let's just have a cliche headlock/choke-you-out scene. Amazingly developed creepy hypnosis mother? Let's just stab her after she breaks her trance with NO LINES OF DIALOGUE. NONE.  Cunning ""sugary-sweet"" dad? Let's just gore him and be done with his whole character.  Even the girlfriend's death, which was arguably the most well-developed and well-executed, just betrayed a lot of what we liked about her! She's cunning, slimy bitch who outwitted our main character.  So her undoing is that she didn't see the obvious flash of a camera to the other character (grandpa)? We couldn't see her try to outsmart our character?  She hardly gets any witty banter for her death? She just kinda... stares at Chris? I didn't get it.  

Sorry, I'm probably making this sound so much worse than it actually is, because the parts of the film it does well, it does REALLY well. But I just can't wrap my head around why the last 1/3 of this film was resolved in 10 minutes.  So disappointing given the excellent set-up.

PLEASE! CHANGE MY VIEW!

EDIT: Please, I'm actually wanting to discuss the film, I know it may be easy to downvote because it's an unpopular opinion, but I would love to hear from people that loved the film to address some of the problems I found with it. Perhaps I'm just not looking at it correctly.",5vv1qh

-he mentions the fighting art where you are always 4 steps ahead (then later Chris thinks ahead and stabs him in the leg when he tries to kick the door shut

They were throwing up insane amounts of red flags for Chris with their big creepy smiles and totally bizarre mannerisms (think the conversation between Chris and grandpa as he was chopping wood, or grandma seeming to have no vocabulary).

deaqg7m,"Since everyone else is sharing what they thought about *Get Out*

I was confused when I saw the trailers -- the first trailer I saw I thought this would be a horror film and then I saw other trailers and I thought it would be more of a comedy film

It's really neither a full horror or full comedy film.  It's actually really tame or mild for both..

I'd call it a thriller film.  The most violent and horrific scenes actually hide the violence which is pretty tame compared to the violence in Key and Peele sketches or the movie Keanu

The comedy was pretty tongue in cheek I heard more stuffy nose kind of laughs than full-on laughter in the audience... I felt the funniest moments coming from the bombastic TSA agent and the campy scares moments that are unexpected and accented with the huge bass thud trope in movie soundtracks -- for some reason the fact they get me every time makes me laugh. 

I don't think the movie gets too into itself or ""cerebral"" or takes itself too seriously

It's a good ""summer"" movie that will probably be as easily forgettable

EDIT - Is it fair to compare this movie's objective to a TV show like *Atlanta*?

I tend to go for the emotional content in subtext, and all through this I got a dreadful sense of child sexual abuse. The drunken, violent, impulsive brother seemed pretty tormented, and the image of Rose at the end, blank faced, a robot looking for her next sex partner remind me of the impact of trauma. 

A subtler piece is the ""sunken"" feeling, of going to a far away place where you can observe but not participate, removed from your body and powerless.  This sounds like disassociation, which children do when they are abused.  Also abused children draw themselves as faceless, without an identity, which is what happens to the victims here.

Deer are often killed because they freeze in the headlights of an oncoming car. When Rose hit and killed the deer on the way to her parents' home, [it foreshadowed that she would try to kill Chris later in the movie (at least, kill his consciousness). Chris is later strapped to a chair and stared down by a deer mounted on a wall, a nod to white culture's obsession with hunting and taking down that prize deer. Instead of freezing in the moment, he skillfully escapes from the situation and uses the deer to turn the tables on Rose's dad, goring him with the deer antlers. Later, Chris does end up freezing in the headlights, but thankfully it turns out to be Rod, who is there to save the day. We can only hope Chris uses his newfound horns to save the rest of the imprisoned minds.](#spoiler)",5vv1qh
deyd73x,"This may be Get Out's next negative review on Rotten Tomatoes. 
Here's the complaint..


Where Get Out falls apart, though, is in its pilfering of ideas and tropes from other sources whilst hoping that no one will notice. Sadly, we’ve seen The Stepford Wives (Bryan Forbes, 1975) so to rework that as The Stepford Blacks smacks of plagiarism. As the plot progresses, you start to notice other borrowings – a man sinking in to black darkness from Under The Skin (Jonathan Glazer, 2014), a man bound to a chair and watching a TV out of Videodrome (David Cronenberg, 1983) a surgeon’s home operating theatre taken from French classic Eyes Without A Face (Georges Franju, 1960). And a particularly silly sequence towards the end has one character attack or kill several others in an attempt to escape which has appeared in countless horror films.

That said, there are still some clever moments, such as the plot’s resolution for which producer-writer-director Peele pulls an unexpectedly neat trick out of his bag. Overall, though, this writer was disappointed. Peele is clearly a talent to watch, but first time out he doesn’t quite cut it
http://www.dmovies.org/2017/03/13/get-out/
From the UK.",5vv1qh
devgd3i,"I think it was an awesome movie. It definitely had some throwbacks to old school horror, with the filming style and score. With that being said there are three things I think should have changed.


**First**: The trailer gave too much away. Get Out isn't alone in being guilty of this, as most trailers today give away the entire movie. I think that using short effective teasers like Georgina's ""no no no no"" followed by her tears is a good example. 



**Second**:[I think the scene of Rose searching for NCAA prospects wasn't needed. If Chris was 26 during the events of this film, it's not unreasonable to think that she is around that age. Even if she was 23 the idea of her getting with soon-to-be NFL and NBA stars is crazy. Those guys aren't necessarily looking to settle down while in college or even soon after.](#spoiler)



**Third**: [I think that the ending wasn't what it should have been. Two scenarios for better endings would have been either Chris either being arrested by the cops in the end and charged with murder, or him waking up still in the chair following the choking of Rose](#spoiler)

The stairs at the scene was supposed to be the twist but it didn't get me lol.

The only thing that didn't REALLY make sense if you think about it was how the grandma and grandpa were revealed to be inside the bodies of the others, but I would say were still completely out of character if you take away the physicality. Why in the hell was grandpa running in the middle of the night in those clothes and why that way like he was going to run at Chris? Or the fact that grandpa and grandma were portrayed as true ""helpers"" but if we knew from the get go they were part of the family, why did they act SO animated; it was way overplayed I would say and not to say it didn't work to make me cringe or fool me, but when you tie in together the answers, the personalities didn't REALLY make sense if you think about it.

Some other quick questions I wasn't able to catch or wondered about:

Significance of the stuffed animal, what happened to Andrew? the other abducted black guy jazz musician, the name ""Rose"" to represent a beautiful but dangerous side (thorns), why everyone immediately froze and went silent once he went upstairs?

denqwtx,"I think an even better ending would have been a sly recall to Night of the Living Dead, with our hero dying at the end.

The cops show up and Chris has his hands up and they shoot him dead. Then a news report about a brutal murder spree by a thug. A better social commentary and better ending IMO.

Anyway, I think the movie was mad overrated. Felt more like an extended Black Mirror episode or a badly written M Night Shamalawywalan movie. In fact, young M Night could have tightened up that script some. The film lacked punch where it needed to really hit you in the gut on Chris' journey. The call backs to his mother just don't really resonate as well as they should.

I would probably give it a 6/10. Glad to watch something interesting and new though. Like it is honestly a relief. And I am glad it made a shit load of money. Also, and this isn't a blood lust or anything, but I am really glad they let the black guy actually kill the people in power in the movie and not just underlings. Like it really fucking annoyed me in Django how he only killed the lesser of power racist whites while his buddy got to kill the one in true power. Okay I am starting to ramble on now lol",5vv1qh

dfdcbwa,"I want to talk about what was wrong.  I'll precede this by saying I thought the movie was incredibly well done and important.  The metaphor for racism was profound and the directing was great.

I have two criticisms

1)  I think he hurt the potential for a greater message by having the white folks be essentially taking over the black folk's bodies.  I understand the message of essentially objectifying black skin.  But it's hard to get past the idea that the rest of the town doesn't see that the when the black body is there in the town the racism takes over and they are basically just put to work.

Which is it?  A loved one in a new body or a blank slave?  I can accept that it would happen that way once or twice but eventually they would say, ""look, get me a white body""   OR   they wouldn't have all the loved ones just laboring all the time.  

2)  I find it a bit cowardly of Peele that there were not  black females (except grandma).  She captured about a dozen black men (if I counted the pictures in the box right) but no women?

It's just not realistic that those women aren't getting sick as wanting young bodies.  

But more importantly for a movie whose primary point is about racial objectification to shy away from the double whammy black women get seems like a waste.

To me it felt like a porno for black people who think all white's are malicious and racist. Just felt like it was pushing some agenda that is somehow twisted up in all this PC Culture bs. Seems like there is some weird trend going on right now that if your movie somehow makes white people look bad, or makes gay or transgenders look good then it is guaranteed a great review and a ton of praise. Dear White People Season 1 has a 100% rating on RT right now too.

 Million dollar mansion, with a security code pad viewable, owned by lunatics, has no securiy cameras?  And it's easily accepted they sealed off the basement for mold?

The ear plugs would not have worked, especially as little as he had in them, and again, no camera in that room to watch him!  Just play the tape and be fine?  Where is Scott Evil when you need advice?  But they DID have a cell phone jammer. 

A master hypnotist would only have out post hypnotic suggestions related to their teacups?  All family members would have had words to say. Or at least she would have been able to say sleep.  Porn gets this more accurate.

The gangster from the beginning shows up in a Huckleberry Finn hat?  Way too obvious. A doo rag would not have given it away so much. 

The cops just laugh at him?  Thank God they weren't white.  I mean, the guy shows a pic of a missing person for 6 months, with an identifying tattoo, and the cops laugh?

However, I believe it is offensive to both races, and takes a very binary approach to creating and resolving racial tension. The family is just sociopathic. His gf is just psychopathic. They have no redeeming qualities because well, the white people have to be evil in this movie. Hes strong and aggressive and violent in the end because well, hes a 26 year old black male. It devolves into a race revenge exploitation flick, with no consequences nor emotional payoff (the last scene just contains jokes between Rod and Chris as if Chris simply got pranked, and didnt just murder a whole house of people).

I saw the reviews and fed into the hype and already had carried over love for Jordan Peele from his work with Key and Peele. But I just had a hard time getting past stereotype after stereotype being pushed hard. I knew walking in it was going to be a race based horror movie but I just didn't think it was going to be like that.  
Edit: I came back to edit this post after many discussions with you good people and chiseling down my main points. 

I originally asked ""who was the good white person or normal white person in this movie?"" That got a lot of negative reaction and created a lot of discussion. I want to be clear I wasn't saying oh why wasn't there a white hero to make me feel better or some white character I can identify with? I was pointing out that in the entirety of the movie there isn't one second where a white person shows an ounce of respect for a black person and didn't treat them like property. And watching an hr and 44 min of white people treat black people with no respect and like property can feed into some people's narratives of how life actually is. 
Like this woman... https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OgCg2Ytbb9E 
This kind of backs up my point. Listen to the whole thing if you have time, or atleast go to about 9 min if you have less time. This woman picks point by point how each part of the movie actually reflects the world as she sees it. This is what I was saying kinda bothered me. That it didn't allow someone who would truely buy into this a chance to object to those thoughts. And dangerously could serve as some people's confirmation. Definitely not everyone but atleast some in our society.

Besides feelin some kind of way about it... I did have to say that as a movie viewer the suspense was well played. Just enough mystery was brought to the fore front and answers always seemed to be lightly fed. I noticed re occurring themes which always intrigues me as I know there are multiple levels of understanding going on and I think Jordan did a great job at adding great texture and character building. He didn't drag the movie out 3 hours and told a great and suspenseful story in a 1 hr 44 min span. thanks for listenin",5vv1qh

de8hzv1,"I thought the movie was extremely medicore. Walked into it knowing nothing other than the trailer and the 7.9 IMDb score, which set my expectations high.

The plot was nothing special in function. Skeptical guy becomes more suspicious of the environment. Just as he is about to leave, the terror switch flips, and he kills his way out of it. Very generic survival horror.

I'll compare this to the other film I saw this weekend- A Cure for Wellness, which despite its own flaws, did a masterful job of slowly and carefully slipping the protagonist into the horror, rather than the telegraphed ""3....2....1....and his girlfriend turns on him"" of Get Out.

The other reveals were also obvious. Saw the hypnosis-as-control coming a mile away, and once we knew the father was a neurosurgeon then that was that.

Further, the characters were completely one dimensional- again not uncommon in survival horror. Our protagonist showed no growth or development, and once the terror switch was flipped, the villains went from mildly interesting to one-dimensional obstacles to be systemically killed to finish the plot.

On the positive side, the small parts by the servant/mind slaves were very well acted. More of that would have been nice. Poor man's Kevin Hart was reasonably funny too. The concept itself was unique and deserved a far better-made film. Too bad the execution was completely by-the-numbers.",5vv1qh

deaczfj,"I gotta say, I'm extremely disappointed in this movie. I saw the trailer months ago and was excited, then with all the amazing reviews I was all in and super pumped to check it out last night. I don't see many movies while in the theater but I decided I'd check this one out. I guess I'll just kinda make a bullet point list about my major gripes:

- The story line had promise and I thought was heading in a great direction, but we're lead to believe that there's some sort of brain transplant happening where consciousness is transferred between two bodies? Ah... ok. I guess that kinda ruined it for me because it seems so silly. I would have preferred their motives for killing people race driven or perhaps they're just psychopaths. The transferring of consciousness seemed Sci-Fi-y to me.

- The comedy felt extremely forced. The TSA guy was way too much for me with all the 'sex slave' stuff and just over the top goofiness. The scene in the police station was excruciating. This movie was essentially a 'scary movie' written in between some Key and Peele type comedy skits.

- The two servants were actually the grandparents of the family. So why did they act like they didn't know what the hell they were doing? Did they *just* do the transplant? Seems like they should have been acclimated to their new bodies by then. What was the apology scene with Georgiana all about? Was that the ""real"" Georgiana trying to come out and warn the main character? That was confusing. The man (grandpa) who was running in the dark, why? 

- The dad got killed by a mounted deer head.... Sure, why not. 

- Why was the closet door open at the end? And after the main character found the pictures of his girlfriends with the the maid/servant why did he expect her to hand over the keys? It was obvious that the girlfriend was in on it at that point. 

- The camera flash is what wakes the bodies up into their real selves. Ok, sure. I personally think that's a little lazy but it makes sense so that's fine. But at the end, did Rose not see the camera flash go off on a pitch black rural road? 

- Speaking of the end, so the TSA guy just happens to magically show up at the right place at exactly the right time. Then, in his genius comedic timing wants to crack jokes about what just happened while two people lay dead on the ground and Chris is obviously traumatized. But.. no.. yeah go ahead and crack whatever joke. 

A couple things I did really like:

- I thought the filming was beautiful in a lot of scenes.

- I thought the actors for the two main characters (Chris/Rose) and the father were acted brilliantly. 

- The scene where the mother put Chris under was awesome. ",5vv1qh
deyottx,I am a minority here I guess but HOW does this movie get such a high rating? It was predictable to death. Even the cotton in the ear stuff was predictable. Did audience just feel obligated to give this a good rating to not look like a racist? I am not white or black but I am just judging this movie just like any other movie. This is kind of movie that I would expect to watch if there's nothing else to do on TV. Strictly 6/10. Predictable. Cliched. Over the top with the amount of liberty they took with the science and logical maturity in how characters behave. Only redeeming thing is the funny friend character.

It reminds me of what someone (don't remember who) said about Hot Fuzz - that if you took Hot Fuzz and folded it in half, the two halves would line up. The first half is setup, setup, setup, and the second half is punchline, punchline, punchline. What Jordan Peele has achieved with Get Out is nothing short of breathtaking.

Every single beat in the first act gets twisted into something new in the second act.",5vv1qh

de9mf1r,"Yes! I was thinking exactly the same thing. She made sure she got to him before the party, lest the guests see him smoking, thus decreasing the value of his body.",5vv1qh
dewix2m,When she asks if he smoked around her daughter it probably was her wondering why the daughter didn't report this. Either she didn't know or didn't want to ruin all the work she had invested. Doubt it's that deep but this movie seems to be doing a lot of subtly. ,5vv1qh
deix8rr,I really thought they were just trying to convince him to get hypnotized,5vv1qh
de9dpx7,Good point! I thought it was just a ploy to get him to agree to the hypnosis.  ,5vv1qh
de8ait1,Yup ,5vv1qh
dfgdcum,I think they said that bc they were setting him up to be hypnotized.  I wouldn't be surprised if Rose intentionally chose smokers as victims bc it's a seemingly innocent reason to ask them to undergo hypnosis,5vv1qh

de7xnx5,Yes. The whole audience gasped when they saw the lights lol,5vv1qh
de7o0qu,YES! So much yes! Everyone also applauded at the end of the film as well.,5vv1qh
de8rfvg,"Yup! I saw it in an affluent area of Tampa. Movie got 3 applause lines. One when Chris stomped LaxBro's head in, one when Rose got shot, and one when the police door swung open and it said ""airport.""



That last scene was so well done. When the flashing lights show up you get a pit in your stomach that he's going to get arrested or shot, due to his race and race of Rose. When you see the door says ""Airport,"" it's definitely a ""fuck yes!!"" moment.",5vv1qh
de89l9x,"Also notable, this is the first time we see Chris and his best buddy together, if I remember right. It's like he found his true friend after being sort of torn away by a girlfriend.",5vv1qh
df4gpp5,"If you think about it, the cop that appeared in the deer accident scene might just be a decent guy. He asked to see some ID and let got when he got rejected / offended. Had him seen Chris's ID, he'd later realize that he was the missing person. Rose played the racism card to get him off her ass. Given that, I'd believe he would be more likely to arrest Chris rather than shoot him on site. Chris would have the chance to clear his name. It wouldn't be as dramatic though.",5vv1qh

It was a fantastic scene.",5vv1qh

de86ehy,Can we also talk about how she smiled as he was close to choking her to death? Fucking crazy. Like she was enjoying the fact she had pushed him to kill her because it proved her ideology. ,5vv1qh
de60wos,"I thought the same thing while seeing it. He really loved his mother, as he did Rose (until.. you know). He felt extreme guilt for his mother's dead & this time around, same situation, he didn't. I thought it was incredible. ",5vv1qh
de6ngnt,"Maybe I'm overthinking... when his mother lay on the road his fear kept him from saving her, when Georgina lay on the road his guilt made him get her. He was able to make his own rational choice about Rose. His personal agency was fully realized after nearly losing it entirely.",5vv1qh
de8vykz,That's why he stopped choking her. He knew the most horrible death was her dying alone on the road hoping someone comes. He felt that was the death she deserved. Not the easier way out. ,5vv1qh
deabn84,Also saw it as a nod to the deer they hit & her dad thanking God whenever he sees a deer dying on the side of the road.,5vv1qh
de8qssp,"Was really hoping as Chris sat in his TSA friend's car and they're about to pull away, Chris said something like ""run the bitch over,"" or something to that effect. I felt the movie did a good job avoiding a lot of tropes, but leaving antagonist alive for the audience to assume they died was kind of a big one. ",5vv1qh
deq7s02,"I also found a correlation in that when Chris' mother was dying and needed help Chris was watching TV and did nothing, and how his TSA friend was watching TV when Chris needed his help, but his friend actually did something (internet research and talking to the detectives) and saved Chris's ass.  Sorry for the run-on sentence. ",5vv1qh
dkeximm,"I know this is 4 months later, but I just finished the movie and that has so many parallels to the opening with the deer- the mirror breaking; the body not being dead, but is dying; Chris's odd connection with the deer (represents his mother/Rose); and the fact that law enforcement ends up coming to the rescue.",5vv1qh

dek5c99,That part was sooooo creepy. ,5vv1qh
detob6s,"I'm still trying to make sense of that scene too! I figure it's this: 

The whole event was to see who was to buy Chris! 

Each time Chris was in view we acted like everything is normal because why wouldn't it be? We do these all the time right? Well mostly just chat and keep an eye on Chris. I think there was always a shot with someone in the background looking at this in the background in the party. 

So the moment he goes out of eye sight without making it look suspicious that they'd follow him up, they just listen attentively, which makes them have to stop the charade. Even for a second, a glimpse into the real world.  ",5vv1qh

dew96ah,I think along with not having to put up the facade and also listen to see what he's doing. Possibly this is another time that they can stop acting congenial and discuss the auction or plan things they don't want Chris to hear.,5vv1qh

He knows the truth, she knows he knows, and as he is realizing how fucked he is he realizes that she knows exactly what is going through his mind that whole time because she's done it so many times before. Now think about how many other dudes went through that same exact thing but didn't make it out without getting suppressed into their mind and being forced to watch someone control their body for the rest of their lives and witnessing it happen to person after person simply because they decided to date the wrong white person.

It's hard to find a horror movie that explores an adult fear. You got a serial killer slashing people up, or a monster from another dimension, yeah, that's scary, but...being hypnotized and still being aware the entire time?

It's typically indie/young directors with unique visions that get picked up by Marvel, and IMO it's because of the compromise. The young visionary director can bring something new to the table, while Marvel still has a good degree of control because the director isn't as acclaimed/entrenched as a Kenneth Branagh or Joe Johnston or Jon Favreau, which allows Marvel to have a good degree of control while allowing unique additions. 

Peele doing a Doctor Strange sequel (after at least one independent production) would be great. Or maybe Captain Marvel.

No, black people aren't taught to expect to be endangered, betrayed, used, or exploited. If anything, it's just the opposite. Black people are taught that they are flawless and deserve success rather than having to earn it. Want proof of this, look at the Affirmative Action law, which gives advantages for blacks they aren't qualified for or haven't earned. It's the only law in the United States that is racist in intent. But it just so happens to be racist against white people, not black people.

Chris did say ""why are you doing this."" Specifically, he asked ""why black people?""

I myself am extremely liberal, but holy shit. I can't tell you how many people I know (specifically middle-aged liberals) who love to spout off all these weird micro-aggressions. They don't seem overtly racist on the surface, but they build up. The ""I would have voted Obama for a third time"" is something we've all probably heard a lot.

I think those micro-aggressions played really well with the family trying to ""seem"" not racist. There is still a large portion (though I'd argue less than the far right) of liberals who have this undercurrent of racism attached. This film spoke to that extremely well.",5vv1qh

Jeremy I think either had some sort of mental illness or was some kind of violent sadist. During the dinner scene I think he was trying to signal to the family ""hey let's do this now, I'll start kicking his ass"" but they had him back off.  It's not really explained as to what changes (if any) a person's mentality experiences after the operation. Grandma acted like what you would of expected from a 90 year old grandma (until the end). She seemed frail and timid although she had a body half her age. Grandpa might of been playing dumb as to avoid a real conversation with Chris. On the other hand, perhaps he was suffering from mild dementia before the transplant which could of transferred over. ",5vv1qh

So everyone tries to see if he's good at the things they want to be able to do.  That's why the blind art gallery owner ends up bidding so much for him, he has an excellent eye for photography.  Everyone else asks about the stuff they care about doing themselves like golf, like when the guy asks about how Chris is at golf it's because he wants a body from someone who is a good golfer.

The fact that the Asian guy is also one of them seems to be insinuating that (at least some) Asian people are model minorities to the extent that they're let in on shady shit.  I'm not sure I agree with that from a real world perspective but I think that's why there was an Asian guy.  And I think he's also asking about how it is being African American almost as a comparison again the experience of being the only Asian amongst all these white people.",5vv1qh

But once you know, you realize he meant it literally; ""being black"" has been pretty good for him so far.",5vv1qh
df0e3vn,"I watched it a second time, and Logan's answer was actually a pretty big clue to what was going on, but the audience is too focused on Chris fumbling with the camera to pay much attention. Logan openly says he doesn't know much about the African American experience because he hasn't wanted to leave the house lately. This doesn't make sense until you find out the guy talking has only been black for a couple months or so, and has been using his new body to plow his wife that entire time.",5vv1qh
dedzq64,"I'm still trying to figure out the Asian guy's role.  I also had the theory that he was already a ""transplantee"" and was looking for a new experience.

But now I'm leaning towards the Asian guy's presence indicative of him being a ""Model minority"" and therefore accepted by Whites.  If this is Peele's intention, I think it's short-sighted.  Asian Americans have faced oppression and still face racism and bigotry today. See: US railroads, internment camps, 1960s United Farm Workers, Hollywood, etc.  

Let's assume that the Asian guy isn't a transplantee, but is obviously accepted by the whites and participates in the bidding.  Would it be wrong to say that his participation in the bidding is almost like Steve Harvey commentary that Asians (specifically Asian males) can't be sexy?

I don't think that this is necessarily true because if you were a white person in an Asian person's body I don't think you would retain the accent, but it adds another layer to it if it was. I also don't think its true cause that Asian man is much too old to have been wanted as a second body accounting for the timeline of the mom and dad becoming doctors.",5vv1qh

Turned out there wasn't, but horror movies and thrillers often prod people to investigate and look for conspiracies. 

We wanted Rose to be innocent because she was the sweet, caring, girl who was on the audience's team since the beginning. It wasn't because she was a white girl.

I thought it was a genuine question, filtered through a perspective of comparing the relative disadvantages of being perceived as foreign (and benign) versus being black (and oppressed in every conceivable social and cultural category). A lot of Asians and Asian Americans (I am one) erroneously reduce race into binary categories, like are the disadvantages Chris experiences worse than what a first-generation immigrant experiences. First (and second)-generation immigrants from countries that heavily import Western popular culture have a very one-dimensional perspective on race in America. They're blind to some of the things that may seem obvious to people living in America. It simultaneously broke my heart and felt very appropriate to see a lone Asian person existing (superficially, at least) on the same level as a group of white people. It harkens back to the Chinese Exclusion Act preventing women and children from immigrating to the US, an otherness experienced by Asian people in a group of white people, and a desire to assimilate into whiteness. Asians and Asian Americans derive so much of their privilege from preventing other non-Asian POC the same access and opportunities.

Rather I think the scene messes with our expectations. By the trailer and word of mouth we know going in the movie is about a black boyfriend going home to meet his white girlfriends parents. We expect racism and the meeting with the cop tells us that Rose is on his side, an that the racism we experience may not be overt (ie: it isn't going to be people hating him).

In that context we start getting hit with the subtle racism of ""I like Obama"", ""I met tiger"", ""with your genetics..."" comments that we see as racism because the stage has already been set. The main characters discussed it (comments like Obama specifically so that the audience knows what to look for and then we dive into more varied versions.

dev395n,"That scene did two things in my opinion: 

It demonstrated the dismissive nature that some black women have towards black men who date white women.


Illustrated how missing black people are dismissed in general. 

I don't think that the detectives being black was necessarily commentary on black on black racism, but more a statement about police and their reluctance to investigate cases with black victims. 

On my Facebook feed the other day I read a post from a mother expressing her disgust towards the local police department for failing to investigate and process the rape kit of her 12 year old daughter. She was raped a year earlier by a home intruder who climbed through the window of her home. She cited that another woman, who was white, rape case got investigated and closed within a week of the incident. Not to mention the media attention that said rape received on local media, whereas her daughter's case received none. I consider this case in point when it comes to the lackadaisical  approach by law enforcement with crimes that involve black victims. ",5vv1qh
deuxzrb,"For me the most interesting part of the detective film is when Rod says that Chris is dating a white girl, because the Black women gives a slight pause that indicates that he can continue. It's interesting to me because it demonstrates the level of mistrust black women have of white women. For sure one of my favorite moments in the film.",5vv1qh
df03elw,"I agree that the pretext for hypnosis is much more important. if they were going to sell him many years from now the smoking would be an issue, but smoking for a few more days doesn't matter.

df0vfks,"Not a doctor in any way, but I've read that smoking prior to surgery causes complications in surgery to doctors monitoring the anesthesia. Since these two were doing all the heavy lifting during surgery, it only makes sense that they'd want to minimize complications.
",5vv1qh
df19imd,"I mean, you could pretty much make the case for hypnosis for any syptom, really. In Chris' case it was smoking, but one could make the case that hypnosis helps with anxiety, or that it helps curb other bad behavior. I'm not sure if any of that is true, but given that these young men (and woman) are invested in impressing the family, I think they are much more succeptible to the hypnosis because they want to please the mother rather than actually change themselves. Chris didn't really care about quitting smoking--he was more invested in giving a good impression to Rose's family. 

In other words, I don't think Rose looks specifically for smokers. When she begins to get to know her next victim, she pinpoints several areas where this person could improve, and then when they get to her house the parents make a big deal of this and discuss hypnosis as a cure.

I think some people are more susceptible to hypnosis. In Chris' case, his unresolved issues with his mother's death presented a great entry point for the hypnosis. I'm not sure how they would manage with an individual who has less unresolved issues. But gathering from the scene where Rose is looking up NCAA players, it seems to me that they tend to look for physically impressive individuals rather than emotionally broken ones. I guess if they have strong emotional issues, that's a plus.",5vv1qh

I also interpreted Rose's death a little differently.  I think that Chris left her there to die not because he couldn't bring himself to kill her but because he wanted her to suffer.  He had a whole monologue earlier about how horrible it was for his mother to bleed out by the side of the road and IMO that was foreshadowing.

I do think you're reading too much into it as far as the 1960s civil rights stuff.  Andre wasn't an activist or hero and he wasn't trying to solve inequalities.

>I heard some people say this movie is aggressively negative about white people and they might be offended by that.

Jordan Peele is half white and his wife is white too so he obviously doesn't feel *that* negatively about white people or he wouldn't have married Chelsea Peretti.  He has also said in interviews that his in-laws are great and have never made him unconfortable and the parents in *Get Out* aren't based on them.

>he weirdness and racism that he points out to Rose is brushed off by her, as you guys have stated, she gaslights him

Rose seems in denial about racism *before* they go to her parents house but actually I don't think Rose gaslights him after the subtle racial stuff actually starts happening- she's he one who expressed frustration at her brother and parents when she and Chris talk after dinner, and this is important because the movie is criticizing the liberals who act woke but are actually condescending.  Multiple white characters say they ""would have voted for Obama a third time,"" there's the scene where Rose seemingly defends Chris from the policeman, etc.  She lulls him into a false sense of security with her whole ""I believe you, I'm on your side, I look out for my man"" demeanor.  It's like how ""white feminists"" will bash Trump's pussy grabbing comments but they don't give a shit when all these poor black girls are getting kidnapped in DC.

That's something else I think you missed- you mention ""Trump's America"" but none of the main characters in this movie are people who would support Trump, in fact it's specifically made clear that they're liberal Democrats.  Trump and his ilk aren't the ones who are being criticized here.  It's people like Bill Clinton who is affectionately called ""the first black president"" despite [being the reason for the mass incarceration of African-Americans](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/9638934), people like Hillary who [call black teens ""super predators""](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/28/reince-priebus/did-hillary-clinton-call-african-american-youth-su/) but then turn around and say [""I've got hot sauce in my bag!""](http://m.washingtontimes.com/).  Even the show Key & Peele tended to criticize condescending liberals more often than they criticized conservatives.",5vv1qh
dfbvzgt,"Though I think you may be reading too much into Andre/Chris as representations of attitudes throughout recent history, the gaslighting as a representation of white attitudes is so on point, I gained another level of respect for this movie.  If that's what Peele intended, it's an incredible and subtle part of the movie, and it was unintentional, your creating of that thread is equally brilliant.

I do think there's an instinct to treat the movie as anti-white, because it doesn't hide in any way that it's one black guy against a slew of freaky white people, but the movie's treatment of this is incredible, and as a white guy myself, I think it points to a ton of problems that revolve around a complicit white culture that, by not trying to snub out its own racist tendencies, reinforces them.

So I think pretty much they all decided that they'd have a shot in being young again, and let everyone think they died, while they start up a new life.  

Blind guy would sacrifice his art dealership.  He was old and couldn't even see the photographs anymore.  The choice was either to wait out death, or to jump into another body, of a decent photographer, and build it all up again.  Hell, if I didn't have to steal a body, I'd do the same thing when I'm old and blind.

They could easily fake a death.  Actually at a certain point if you're old enough, you just tell the coroner that your husband died in his sleep.  They don't bother with autopsies. ",5vv1qh

dgcxvz3,"I  just got out of the movie and one of my biggest initial reactions is that I thought the ending was a very refreshing change of pace for a slasher/thriller movie. I'm more into tension, suspense, and character's making logical decisions within the rules of their world versus fight/struggle scenes I've seen so often - so I'm glad they wrapped it up as quickly as possible. Logically there would have been a camera in that room and someone with a shotgun standing guard; but since that wasn't the case, once Chris got the upper hand (of surprise with make-shift weaponry) then there was no reason he couldn't make it out of there alive pretty easily. I am so sick of spending a half hour on the good guy up, good guy down, up, down, up, down dance that we've all seen so many times. 

On that note, I was disappointed that the brother recovered from his head injury to fight him again and that he also let ""grandma"" in his car, especially considering that he seemed to have a pretty good grasp on the surgery process. If the Director was going for the refreshing take of good guy wins, without assistance, then I wish at the very least they left the brother's retaliation out of it. As I'm writing this, I guess the grandma/maid recovery is forgivable because it tied together ""the family's process"" and Chris discussed the hit-and-run during his hypnosis.

It was also interesting how Rod didn't show up until it was all over essentially - I don't know what to make of that but glad he didn't show up ""just in time"". 

Not to mention, I normally don't care if the protagonist survives because they are usually unlikable idiots; but Chris was completely likeable and that family, especially the girl, were descipable. I've never rooted for the evil people to die so badly in a movie before - Peele did a fucking awesome job in building his characters and that's what really made this movie special in my opinion.

dfai6m1,"Yeah she was gaslighting him from the jump. What's wild is it was easy not to suspect her involvement for so long, because it was all so normal.

They're basically conditioned by white supremacy to keep trusting us, even if somewhere inside (the sunken place) is screaming GET OUT.",5vv1qh
dfd9cnm,"I think it is foreshadowing what we find out later, that is is really her white husbad in Andre's body and this fact is something the rest of the world cannot find out about. So, he has to stay home all the time because it would be very weird if the missing kid from the city is now with a white woman in her late 60s. Plus maybe Andre would be seen by someone he knew. ",5vv1qh
dfcj650,"I feel that the husband says it in earnest, but, coming from a black body on display at a white gathering, it feels off. When ""Andre"" (dead husband) twirls in front of guests it feels like (true) Andre is being objectified. Chris only asks ""Andre"" if he's comfortable as one black individual to another (both in the company of only whites.) Ironically Chris doesn't realize he's actually speaking to a white individual, thus the response seems out of place. The scene only makes sense when we learn who ""Andre"" really is at that moment. ",5vv1qh
dfi72po,"Also the headlock from Rose's brother at dinner. What I thought was really clever about the mirroring of those scenes was how Rose's brother was going on about Chris' ""genetic makeup"" and how jiu jitsu is superior to judo because it's a battle of wits rather than pure strength (the implication being that though black people are stronger, white people are smarter) but then when they are fighting at the end Chris tricks him by coaxing him into kicking the door, then stabbing his leg to gain the upper hand--winning with wit.",5vv1qh
dfqjdp4,"I think it's because there's the psychological conflict of the black and white person. The black person wants to 'get out' (in the sense of the sunken place), to tell Chris that he's in danger, but the white person tries to resist the black subconscious from doing that. As /u/pm_me_palindromes mentioned, Georgina was triggered when Chris said ""I get uncomfortable around a lot of white people.""",5vv1qh

So seeing someone from a distance (in the night) running at you at full speed for no reason would be absolutely terrifying. ",5vv1qh

dhp774v,"I've seen a lot of articles that try and explain this, but most of them seem to be pretty biased. Although Asians aren't white, they [definitely aren't disadvantaged like African Americans are.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_in_the_United_States_by_household_income#By_race) Even in other Western countries Asians have always excelled while other minority groups seem to be disadvantaged. The movie is from a Black persons perspective, and maybe Jordan Peele views Asians as a minority group that enjoys the same privileges as White people. The guy is clearly Japanese too (Mr. Tanaka), which might be an important detail. Japan has a [history of racism,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_issues_in_Japan#Ethnic_issues) and even imperialism, so it might be possible that Japanese people are viewed as having an equally shady past concerning racial issues.

I don't think he was taken by the rich White family or there against his will. We see him bidding during the auction scene and asking Chris questions just like the other guests. I think the most likely explanation is that he was a rich foreigner who heard about the transplant procedure and wanted to get in on it.",5vv1qh
di1xse6,"I think it's supposed to be a commentary about how Asians are more accepted by white people, but still subject to racism. During the bidding scene, his card has yellow dots.

di91vt5,That's a false equivalence. Black on white crime is prevalent in those areas while white on black is practically nonexistent. Perception is irrelevant from the fact that black majority communities have higher crime rates regardless of income level.

de8uowq,Grandma/grandpa slept with Allison prior to the op.  He probably commented to keep up appearances.,5vv1qh
de90a3n,The deer was symbolic of his mother who was also hit by a car and left for dead (as we would find out later) that's initially why we see him show such concern to see what they hit in the beginning of the movie bc of his past . We know eventually he gets motivation from the incident pertaining his mother and the reoccurring buck acts as a reminder to no longer settle and do anything like he did when his mother got hit and spring into action. The black buck thing is a bit too far fetched. Don't believe this movie sealed with racism in a sense but more so with white over valuing black qualities to where they wanted to physically and mentally possess those qualities,5vv1qh

It can be assumed that the girlfriend isn't dumb enough to let that happen, but then who left it open? Georgina? And if it was Georgina, then what does that imply when it comes to the mind control? If a host person fights hard enough, can they break free for moments at a time? Just something interesting.

Rose's family has been hinted to abhor their practices of kidnapping black people. To remain normal, they have developed some coping mechanisms. The son appears to be a drug user, the mother is at odds with the grandmother, Rose's dad developed a god complex, and Rose keeps photographs of her past boyfriends. It was Rose who kept leaving the closet door open. Her family members would had destroyed those photographs if they'd discovered them.  ",5vv1qh
de9eqiq,"I think Rose was the one who left that open. One of the last things we see of Rose in the movie is her looking up shirtless pics of black basketball players while drinking milk through a black straw. She legitimately likes black men and they're not being very subtle about it.

As far as why the brother wanted to fight him, well if you are talking about during the dinner scene, I think he was drunk as hell.

He saw the pictures yes, but doesnt truly let himself believe the implication until Rose wont get the keys and then reveals herself. There for the tension for the audience knowing whats happening and waiting for the reveal is much more satisfying than a super surprise: that rose is in on it. In my book that is superior in a movie, effective tension, rather than a slightly more logical sequence of events with no tension.

> 

Aside from her potentially coming off as a fetishist, it also serves as an explanation for the tone-deaf nature of her family and their friends. I don't think they accept black people as people (rather than vessels) and their assumptions and attitudes reflect that. Rose's father certainly doesn't come off as someone who has black friends he regularly speaks to. 

I noticed that as well with the brother, how he talked about BJJ as something that isn't mastered through pure strength (which he assumes Chris would have a natural advantage in), but rather complex strategy, which I can only assume he feels he has the natural advantage in.


>I tried to count how many photos of the victims there were. At least a dozen. Were all of these men (and one woman) successfully 'captured?' Missing persons reports are taken more seriously than the film would lead you to believe. Rose would of been discovered pretty quickly as their significant other and questioned as to their whereabouts. The frequency of this occurrence would of lead authorities to believe she is somehow involved.

I'm wondering the same thing. But I think about how Chris doesn't really have family, just his one friend (that we know). There was no mention of who raised him after his mother died, so he might have been in the foster system.

He's a freelancer, so no one's checking if he clocks into work. I bet Rose specifically seeks out people who are less likely to cause attention if they disappeared. If Chris' parents were in the picture, they would definitely be searching for him if he went missing.

[The first instance Georgina snapped out of it was when the mother tapped her spoon against the glass when the family was out on the deck drinking tea. We see that Georgina freezes up serving tea. The mother told Georgina to go back inside and lie down. In order not to blow her cover, she'd follow the rules. However, the mother got suspicious during dinner, went to the kitchen re-validated the hypnosis, then brought out the cake. Georgina is hypnotized again.

The second instance would be when Chris was being hypnotized for the first time. The grandfather knew because he saw from outside. Georgina must've heard, and perhaps heard the spoon, releasing her again. She served the family without anybody knowing during the party; while she was ""free"" she unplugged Chris's phone to scare him off the premises by making him not wanted. Chris told his girlfriend about the incident, the girlfriend went straight to her mother since something was wrong. Georgina immediately appears and apologized to Chris; she leaves the closet door open for Chris to find the photographs of his lying girlfriend. We can assume the mother re-validated the hypnosis at that point.](#spoiler)",5vv1qh

-The story about hiring Georgina and Walter was revealed to just be a cover to explain why they lived at the house.

-Dean is their son.  Dean perfected the surgery, so that phrasing makes sense.

-Crazy isn't the same as incestuous.",5vv1qh
dg6ikm7,"That's certainly possible but I never had anything cause me to think that throughout the movie.

1) This is true, but assuming they weren't incestuous, it seems highly improbable to me that her mother's parents would share such outlandish ideals with her father's - and we know her known grandfather came up with the procedure sometime after he lost to Jesse Owens. I mean it's possible, just seems like a grasping for straws situation to really have it make sense.

2) I took this as just a way to add to the illusion they were easily explained staff of some sort. If I remember correctly her father says something along the lines of ""and we just felt we couldn't let them go after all they've done"" (probably just butchered the actual quote lol). Couldn't let them go serves as a double entendre when taken more literally than expressively. Additionally, it was supposed to make Chris for more comfortable, eliminating any sorta of slave connections.

3) It was literally perfected by his flesh and blood, his brain was successfully transplanted.

4) Rose is on the more psychopathic side. She's revealed to be extremely calculated and is almost artistic at what she does, also her tendency to form what seemed to be seriously committed relationships shows an absolute lack of remorse.

Her brother on the other hand, is more on the sociopathic side. He's impulsive to the point he doesn't ever consider consequences of his actions, has a clear disregard for what one would consider normality, is easily angered, and he doesn't ever truly accept authority (as displayed by his reactions to his parents).",5vv1qh
dg6gnx4,">Like, DUDE, RUN!! GTFO! Run away from these crazy white people as fast as you can and don't stop!

Run where?  Rose specially said that the house is the only one for miles.  How far would he really be able to go on foot?  And there's no way he could have out-run Walter, remember that the Grandpa was an Olympic-level sprinter.

>And as soon as he saw Missy downstairs, he should have tackled her and choked her the fuck out. Kill that bitch immediately.

First of all, he didn't know the extent of what Missy was doing, he just knew it was something very weird.  Why would he all of a sudden kill her?  Also the entire family was there too (including Jeremy the black belt) not just Missy.  Why would he, who has never harmed anyone in his life, murder this lady in front of her family?  That's not how adrenaline works.  He had no idea the extend of what they were planning to do.  *Later on*, after seeing the Coagula video, he realizes it's kill or be killed, but before then he didn't know what was going on.

>Also, Walter should have shot Rose in the face. I mean if you're going to take someone out, take them all the way out.

Did you not get the foreshadowing in Chris's monologue about his mother's death?  He specifically said that the way his mother died- slowly bleeding out on the side of the road- is the worst death possible, and *he wishes the car had finished her off so she could have had a quicker death.*  Walter shooting her in he stomach is pretty much a death sentence as she was mortally wounded, and it's much more painful than instant shotgun death.  It also allowed the irony of the last scene when Chris decides to abandon Rose to bleed out on the side of the road- being shot in the face or strangled would have been too kind on her.  When Chris abandoned her, he ensured that she suffered in the same way his mother did.",5vv1qh

I think the reason Chris didn't bash Jeremy's head in 100 times or Walter didn't shoot Rose in the head is because they aren't killers.  They are innocent victims.  Chris just wanted to get away, Walter just wanted to stop Rose so Chris could get away.  They weren't out to kill anyone.  ",5vv1qh

White women used to be very ""off limits"" to black men in America, many of whom were [murdered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmett_Till) for even daring to look at one. So when some black women see black men with white women, they feel betrayed because they remember their aunts, sisters, mothers, or even themselves (remember, we're only 52 years removed from the voting rights act, so a lot of those civil rights protesters are still around at various ages) sticking by black men, loving and protecting them. They wonder how their man could abandon the black women who have fought beside him in order to be with a white woman when he knows that he would have been hung for even having a conversation with her just a generation ago, especially when such horrible deaths often resulted from [false accusations](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/02/07/emmett-till-murder-case/97588506/).

They should have just kept it as hypnotized slaves or something like that. If it wasn't for the transplant crap, the movie would have been near perfect for me.

I think if the movie had gone into a bit more detail on the whole ""Behold the Coagula"" agenda then I'd be enticed but something felt very missing from the plot.

Perhaps I just need to watch it a second time because obviously the people here are freaking out over it.

deg611u,"I think the spoiler tag is annoying, so I'm just going to preface this whole comment: **possible spoilers below!**

**Review as a fan of horror movies:**

I really enjoyed this as a psychological horror film. I love the sorts of horror films where you replay the moving in your mind trying to remember all the hints and tells you were shown through the movie. This film had a tin, and I'm looking forward to watching it again.

The hypnosis scenes were really tense, and you could feel Chris's fear as it began to take hold. I felt like the imagery of the ""sunken place"" (or whatever she called it) was a bit over the top (and I would have liked to have seen something more subtle). 

There was a lot of symbolism through the movie, as mentioned elsewhere on this page. Things like the deer representing Chris's mother. I really enjoyed piecing these elements together in retrospect, and I think it all shows how much care Jordan Peele put into this movie. 

**Review as a white guy:**

I'm a youngish (28) middle class white male. I saw this in Boise, ID. There were all white people in the theatre. As it's going through the movie, all the awkward moments with the white people and their ""subtle"" (not so subtle) racism made me quite uncomfortable. But, it wasn't until after the movie that I started to internalize all that. I've started to wonder: am I a racist? Could I be racist like that and not even realize it? I know my parents are the overt, racial slur kind of racist. But what if I'm the ""white guy who listens to hip hop and loves Key and Peele"" sort of racist?

It's not a good feeling. 

The last scene of the movie has been mentioned a lot on this page. As a white man, I have never, in my life, felt threatened by a police officer. Even when I get pulled over for speeding or otherwise breaking the traffic law, I feel like I'm safe. I can carry on a cordial conversation with the cop. When the red and blue lights kicked on, I felt dread, and it was a masterfully played move by Jordan Peele. I immediately got the message that was intended there. It was really eye-opening. People online talk about white privilege, and I never really got it. I grew up in a broken home, dealt with family-wide alcoholism and drug abuse, had to work hard and pay my own way through college. I never felt like I was ""privileged."" But that scene made me realize that there are little things I take for granted. Things like assuming that the police will be on my side. Things like assuming I will be accepted by my girlfriend's parents. 

Anyway, that's my two cents. I think it's a great movie, and I will recommend it highly. 
",5vv1qh
dedc5s4,"Old white dude here.  Loved it.  So glad I saw it in the theater, too.  It's such a smart, entertaining film and it does it with suspense as much as horror, instead of just torture porn or gore.

The thing about tension is that the energy in an audience at a good horror film should be pretty tense, perhaps that contributed to the vibe in the place?  But I am not trying to dismiss your feelings, they are surely more attuned to it than mine.

I would be shocked if anyone of any race saw that movie and didn't immediately start rooting for Chris.  I am sure that Jordan Peele  set out for Chris to be the universal protagonist.  I have read comments here trying to deconstruct intended (or unintended) racial imagery in the script and what I think is cool about this is that the film ""works"" for you even if you miss it, but gets even better when you start thinking about it.  It would be a shame if people chose to miss out on the fun of this movie because it deals with race in America, if that's the reason they don't go see it.

I am really impressed with Peele's first script and directorial debut, I can't wait to see what he does next.

dedi5eh,"I'm a white guy, I saw it with my girlfriend whos mixed race. I loved the movie, but the whole time I completely understood the message behind it, which made me sort of sad tbh. 

I was having a conversation with my girlfriend about it afterwards. How this liberal white family weren't the confederate flag, hood wearing racists, but more so on the institutionalized, not understanding/accepting black culture, which is another type of racism. A lot of liberal white people even might be nice or claim they love black people or minorities. But they don't realize their ignorance to a lot of things(culture, struggles, etc. Example in the movie: ""I would've voted Obama for a 3rd term"" type shit).

I felt the need to explain this to my girlfriend and my black friends(while we were talking about the movie), that I'm not one of ""those white people"" and I ever were act like that, call out my bullshit. I myself cringe when I see a white person say similar things I heard in this movie to one of my black friends.",5vv1qh
dedfqwi,"Subjectively speaking, it might be the most brilliant movie I've ever watched. What really sets it apart to me was Peele's excellent use of symbolism throughout the movie. It was simple, but provocative. Such as the deer on the side of the road representing [Chris's mother and almost overwhelming guilt Chris feels for her death.](#spoiler) The sunken space representing how I imagine black people must feel isolated when they're viewed in the context of their skin color before their character. The portrayal of a slave auction in the modern era was incredible. Peele uses symbolism to get at so many different levels of Chris's experience through life. 

Besides the symbolism, the use of music and 4th wall placement throughout was so unnerving. Georgina and Jeremy made me outright petrified in every scene they had. Something I noticed in dialogue pieces for those two characters, the camera was always really close, uncomfortably close. That effect, to me, really added to their characters. I am not usually one to notice this kind of stuff in movies, but damn Jordan Peele brought it out of me. 

I really appreciate the detail Peele went through to make this movie great, and all in the context of the racial issues that still plague America. 10/10 would watch again.

I knew very little about the movie going in, but me being familiar with Peele's work I repeatedly assured him that the films message was most likely not ""fuck white people"". And you know what? It wasn't!

It never implies that white people in general are evil. But this particular family who happen to be white are definitely evil. I'm not saying there's no social commentary or racial tension in, but it's presented in a such an outrageous way. By that I mean, this family is so demented that I couldn't relate to them just because I'm white. I couldn't see why some white people were supposedly offended by this movie because the villains are so much more than JUST white.

The only thing that made me feel a semblance of ""white guilt"" was the cop mislead at the end. That was very upsetting until they reveal his friend. But it made for such a great ending.

I thought it was incredibly unique, tense, hilarious, well written, and graceful in its social commentary. I think a lot of the people complaining either haven't seen it or don't understand it. Or simply don't want to understand it. I look forward to watching it again.",5vv1qh

Later on towards the climax of the film when Chris is strapped down into the chair, Jim comes on the TV explaining the process and he states the better understanding and willingness the subject has of what's going on, the higher success rate. So I think that the ""girl"" inside Georgina was putting up resistance during the process and lowered the success and ""quality"" of the transplant. Also when they cornered Chris in the living room Missy said ""you already ruined him enough"" thus hinting that resistance and increased mental stress added on top of the stress they may already have can have a negative impact on the process.

dewqxf7,"I thought it was a great plot device that seems superfluous at first, especially I wasn't entirely sold on Chris being a smoker (you were just kind of given that his character smokes when Rose takes his cig from him). It moves the plot in so many ways, like giving him reason to try and take a smoke break in the middle of the night, which leads to him noticing the strangeness of the Armitage residence. It also gave Missy a reason to hypnotize Chris without giving it away that the hypnosis was used for more sinister reasons (as ominous as it was at first). At face value, it also shows that Chris is using cigarettes to cope with his past, which proves to be a major plot point later on when he can't bring himself to leave Georgina.",5vv1qh

It also has to do with his mother...when he was clawing at the post in his bedroom when he felt helpless as a young child....he uses the cigarettes as a crutch, which ultimately saves his life, kinda.

At first, I thought Walter/Georgina/Andre-Logan were wack due to the impact of hypnosis and lobotomy (?) but after reading a couple comments, I'm thinking it's because of their white consciousness.

By avoiding having to explicitly voice their desire to bid on an African American, the Armitage community thus could avoid having to explicitly characterize and villify themselves as racists and borderline slave owners.

At the beginning, they hit the deer, and Chris reacts with a surprising amount of emotion.

When Chris and Rose arrive at the parents' home, Rose's father talks about how he's usually pretty happy when he finds out deer are getting killed, because there are too many deer/they seem to be ""taking over."" It's clear at this point that his deer symbolize Black people/their dehumanization by white people.

dg0j9r5,"My take:

He let her go because she didn't deserve that easy death.  The scene with the dead deer and Chris's monologue about his mother's horrible painful death were foreshadowing.  Remember how Chris freaks out when he sees the slowly dying deer on the side of the road?  Later we find out the reason the deep bothered him so much- it reminds him of his mother's slow, painful death.  *Chris specifically says he wishes the car had killed her instantly because slowly bleeding out on the side of the road is the worst death imaginable.*

Later, Chris is strangling Rose on the side of the same road where they hit the deer.  Chris releases his grip and Rose smiles because she thinks she won and he's not going to kill her.  But then she stops smiling because she realizes he's going to ensure her death is as painful as possible, by leaving her to die in the same way his mother did.",5vv1qh

I'll say too that even though I knew she was in on it I still found her extremely likable.  That all changed when she put her hair up and turned straight evil.  Very good performance by Allison Williams.

Yes I know he used a different more professional camera to capture images but a photographer takes pics with anything that ""catches"" their eye at any given moment.

I loved the scene where Chris was talking to the art dealer via intercom/TV screen and realized that his consciousness would be stuck in the sunken place.

Hitting a deer usually doesn't illicit much of an emotional response from most people because they aren't human and are seen as lesser than humans.  Chris saw it as life, period.  And then to extend the metaphor there are some people that see black people as lesser than human and when one of them dies, no matter the circumstance, it illicits less of an emotional response even though in the end it is a human life.

You will be on your toes but I would call it a psychological thriller than a horror film. ",5vv1qh
de8xnki,"To add to what other people said, it depends on what kind of horror you can and can't take. People are right that this is definitely a thriller and a psychological horror film.
I can't do jump scares too (I've found that it helps to plug my ears if I notice one's about to come up, and I actually do this, even in the theater lol. Sound sensitivity amiright) so I can say this movie only had about three jump scares (I think), and they're I believe all auditory jump scares, rather than ""aaa scary face suddenly in the screen"". The first one wasn't SO bad because I don't think it was full silence directly to loud noise. The second one was super easy to see coming (he's sneaking around in the house at night and it's WAY too quiet), the third one is in the middle of an action scene (honestly I'm IMPRESSED that they managed to pull off a jump scare in the middle of an action scene, as much as I can't handle them I've gotta give props) and got me GOOD like screaming in the theater good but at that point my adrenaline was so high like it wasn't even gonna make a difference at that point lol.

A lot of people will consider this to be less scary than other movies because it's mainly psychological horror, so there's not really a physical boogieman to be afraid of at the end of your hall. It didn't make me feel afraid to be alone in the dark (and I'm very easily scared, despite my love of horror. It's tragic actually ;_; ). However, in my opinion this is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. If you're not white I can only imagine the movie could be even scarier. Instead of appealing to bodily fears (i.e. I'm afraid some psycho or supernatural being will physically hurt me or kill me) it appeals directly to deeper fears. Even without having been in the main character's shoes, the movie builds up such empathy for him (oh my GOD the lead actor is so freaking GOOD) I've honestly never felt so scared at any other movie.

For a good comparison, if you've seen American Psycho, even though the themes are mostly different, it's a similar brand of horror, and personally it made me feel similar kinds of scared. If you could handle American Psycho, you'll be fine in this movie. If that's exactly the kind of soul-cutting horror that you just. Can't. Do.

He went after the Mom because she could hit him with a hypno whammy real easy and then he immediately attempted to leave, but had to fight Rose's brother when he ambushed him.

3. I think it all stemmed from how the grandfather felt during the Olympics when he lost to Jesse Owens in 1936. From the way it was described by Rose's father, he seemed to have developed an obsession with black people being the physically superior race. Most racism stems from the idea that white people view themselves has mentally superior... hence the consciousness transplant of white mental ""superiority"" into black physical ""superiority."" But as it was pointed out throughout the movie, each character seemed to have their own reason for wanting it... everything from ""the BBC"" (that lady whose husband was in the wheel chair, grabbing at Chris's arm and asking in a not-so-subtle way about his cock), to the posh man acting as if black was the next stylish step in his life.",5vv1qh

This is a world where the brain surgery is actually happening, and now Chris has to deal with this trauma and basically hide.

The other view is a metaphoric one. The hypnosis is an experience all black people experience, the tendency of white America to say, hey, be one of us or suffer the consequences. And to be a black person is to be in constant struggle with society. Only those who act white are accepted readily into white society.

The only thing that was keeping him sane throughout this whole situation was that he thought he wasn't alone and he had Rose on his side. But when he realized she kept on looking for the keys... that's when he reached his breaking point because he wanted to accept that she was just being hypnotized, but deep down, he knew she was just like her family. I thought that was completely justifiable for anyone in that situation. ",5vv1qh

1) I definitely agree, but remember, that's Grandma in there.

I think one of the reasons Georgina spills the iced tea she is pouring for Chris is because she isn't used to doing stuff like that and is also worried about trying to not tip him off about what's going on.

Definitely think it was a bit odd for both grandparents to be up so late as I think only Walter really had a reason for it. Walter wanted to keep training to stay in great shape and feel like he would be ready to win his ~~wrestling match~~ race that had happened years before. Maybe the Georgina was still awake because she wanted to go to bed with her husband or talk to him in bed.

The biggest reason they were both acting strange was because they were black people who don't know what it is like to actually be black yet they have to convince a young black guy that they are similar.",5vv1qh
dej12po,"As a horror buff, but also just a movie buff as well, I can say a few things make a horror film a horror film. 

1. Atmosphere. A good horror film will provide not just jump scares and gore, but a general feeling of unease you can't quite put your finger on.

2. Dread. One of the single most important aspects of horror, to me, is the feeling of dread. Almost like you DON'T WANT TO KNOW what is going to happen next... but you MUST. You MUST know.

The director's commentary goes into the reason for the change.  When the film was shot victimization of black people wasn't in the public conscious line it is now and the ending was meant to speak to that, with Chris being basically unfairly forgotten in jail.

deuc5nd,"I have a theory.  We don't know the mental states of grandma and grandpa when they were transferred into Georgina and Walter.  It's entirely possible due to their age that they were beginning to get mentally feeble, or even Alzheimers.  In people with Alzheimers, the symptoms often become more pronounced at night (Sundowning), sometimes even causing them to wander or walk off at night.  Maybe this is why Grandpa was sprinting at night.  One, because he was reliving his youth, and two, because he was mentally not well- hence mobilizing at night, but physically fit, hence sprinting rather than walking.   I also think the Grandma's poor mental state shows in Georgina.  We see her sometimes just staring off in space (like holding the carrot cake in the Kitchen).  Could be malice, could be plan old age.    It may also be why Georgina is able to break though without the camera flash.   ",5vv1qh

""The symbolism between Chris and animals is repeated throughout Get Out. For example, when Rose hits a deer while driving to her parent’s house, she wants to leave it and go. Chris instead goes into the woods to find the wailing deer, where they have a profound moment of connection as it dies. Rose’s father Dean (Bradley Whitford) later comments “One down, a couple hundred thousand to go”. He goes on to elaborate on how much he hates the deer taking over and destroying the ecosystem. Beyond just a symbol of dehumanization (and “Buck” being another derogatory term for black men, specifically those who did not submit to white control), the encounter with the deer seemed metaphorical to the very nature of western civilization. Much like we build highways and cities through the heart of the deer’s home and then blame them when we hit them with our cars, conquistadors, merchants, and settlers from Europe pillaged Africa, Asia, and the Americas, warped our “ecosystems” to what they wanted, and killed, enslaved, or otherwise subjugated us if we became an issue.

Then, Jeremy comes up later and attacks him. When the showdown happened, Jeremy was in a similar situation as the deer - lying on the ground, fatally wounded, gasping - and Chris finally put him out in the exact way I was anticipating for him to take the deer out in the beginning.

At the end in the basement- Chris sees a deer head on the wall- they have what seems to be a primal stare down. Chris - trying to survive -decides to use the deer head- figuratively avenging the deer- and killing the father with its rack- stabbing him in the neck with it.

deuj765,"> Everything except the one line of ""black is in"" suggests that the white people in the film still very much sees black people as specimens, or even pets.

There have been a lot of stories on this, but I think the idea on it is more that they see the black people as a superior race, in terms of athleticism and body build. (mentioned by Jeremy when talking to chris at dinner, shown during the party when the one lady was feeling chris' body and reinforced again when they asked chris what his favorite sport was, baseball, basketball or football.

That being said, the type of racism that this harps on isn't necessarily the type were used to. In this world (Get Out's realm), a true racist, would probably just have killed Chris, because racists see themselves as higher than another race. However, this family is very liberal and almost idolizes the fact that Chris is black. 

I see the racism in this film as less of:

>Let's kill all ""insert race here"" 

and instead more of a 

> I love ""Insert race here"", want to come over to my house and enjoy ""insert stereotypical food for this race"" and we can play ""stereotypical game"", etc etc

He says something along the lines of ""with your physical gifts and our intellect, we can create the perfect human"", meaning they think black people are intellectually inferior and therefore less than them. That goes back to slave mentality, where slaves were considered the brute force and the white masters were the brains.


It's the movie's ability to convey not only explicit, explained to death cliche's of racism but those small micro-aggressions and moments of implicit racism that I think hit home the most - at least for me.

de6z4mp,"Here are my thoughts on your loopholes. 

That secret society we are exposed to in the movie is fascinated by black cultural. There are several references in the movie about black being cool, it is now in. That Asian man asking Chris his thoughts. The point is meant to be, now that black people have established themselves, white people want to be blacK. 

I think the grandma and grandpa acted as servants over the weekend Chris was visiting, was because they were filling a role. But we don't know they always lived as that. 

In the photos where it's revealed Allison has been doing this with other men, we see Chris isn't the first guy. But we don't see those other black guys in the movie. It's likely to believe the body switching process doesn't always work, that's why they have multiple phases, and a vetting process to help make sure they both don't die. The movie hints at that. But I also feel Chris is meant to be this trophy they show off, so they all gather to see him. And Chris even kills the dad with the dear head Mount, he is not this animal on display. 

In the movie Allison was always joking about other boys being into her, you see small signs to support the sociopath mentality later.  

Chris was able to use his cellphone because Allison charged it to talk to Chris's friend, in the recording scene. 

Overall I felt the movie supported itself for its purpose pretty well. I didn't understand the bingo scene, what was the point?  Or why they stopped talking when Chris Went upstairs, why fake a party for a person that doesn't need one?",5vv1qh
de6yt0r,"A lot of this was addressed. From what I can tell, there was this notion of black being bigger, strong, faster etc.... They made a point to essentially state that blacks are the peak of physicality for human beings (this seems to be the movies perspective, not my own).  It, in turn seems to lead one to the notion that the mental capacities of whites are greater. So, overall, the idea is a superior white mind in a superior black body to create this idea of ""perfection"". Also, it doesn't matter if you're black, as long as the whites around you view you as one of their own. There's a lot here that toys with the idea of social acceptance and the death of ones self image in terms of cultural in an effort to fit environmental norms. That's for another day though. 

[The other thing that was addressed was the fact that blacks remained ""slaves"". You have to remember, the only insight we have into this environment is the period in which they are hosting the main character and doing what they can to avoid arousing suspicion. The best way to explain the presence of these characters to an outsider is to simply say that they are servants. The implication is that the only place for blacks in white society is one of subservience and that blacks themselves are more accepting of that idea. There was a statement to be made there. When they aren't putting on a show, it's very likely the grandparents retain their role as the matriarch/patriarch of the family. We were only privy to their presence at a time when the presence of blacks in the household had to be explained in a socially believable way.](#spoiler)

[As for the phone thing, I'm not even sure I know he left his phone charging after it was unplugged by ""accident"". I'm not sure if it died after that. I'm also not 100% sure it was even his phone at the end. That bit is a little blurry for me, I was so caught up in everything going on.](#spoiler) 

[As for the ""twist"". I think that she enjoys her method. You see this come through once she finally begins to act like herself, the manipulation, building of trust, and it's inevitable breakdown in something she enjoys. I got that sense that it makes her feel ""powerful"" in a way. It's not a hassle and it's not all about efficiency. They spend time selecting someone and they only do this every once in a while. They can't do it too often or suspicion will be aroused. When you combine the fact that she enjoys the chase and  manipulation with the fact that it can only occur so often. Her approach doesn't seem out of character.](#spoiler)

[Allison had to be in on it. The hypnosis used through out the film didn't seem to be able to outright control anyone. It wasn't just some lazy substitute for mind control. For the most part it functioned to ensure that the persons mind would be forced into a dormant state, much like separating the mind from the body. It's possible that she could have been controlled, but her being controlled for long periods of time and being forced to take complex actions seems to be more inline with TV or fantasy ideas about hypnosis rather than what the film presents.](#spoiler)

[Also, considering that a camera flash tends to hinder hypnosis, it would be very easy for it to be broken while she's out on dates or in these long term relationships. So, her not being in on it would have been a bigger plot-hole at the end of the day. The point of this movie isn't that all white people are bad, it's a bout a specific circle of somewhat detestable individuals and an insane family. I don't think a film centered around racial satire needs a white victim or a morally upright white person to establish that not all white people are evil. The film spends so much time pointing out the foolishness behind sweeping generalizations that it would have been stepping on it's own toes in the process.](#spoiler)",5vv1qh

They've either got a very mad customer, or a missing person and a body they can't even use.

Making all the white people in this movie in on what's happening makes the point that everyone is a part of this system unless they actively work against it. There's also something empowering in this movie about the black characters saving *themselves*, instead of a white character being the savior.",5vv1qh
de6yx6k,"For the first bullet point, it was stated in the movie that they liked how black people had physical advantages. The guy that took over Andre's body probably was legitimately married to the old white lady. They both agreed that a young black guy's body would be better for their relationship. Gross as that sounds. 

Also, they seem cut off from society. In their social group, they recognize that black people are more physically capable. They don't have to interact outside of their social group so they never experience any racial stigma while living as a black person. 

And for your last bullet point. Yes, it doesn't seem logical or efficient for her to do that. But if we're willing to suspend our disbelief for a brain operation where people can switch bodies to become immortal or believe that their type of hypnotism exists, then I think we can suspend our disbelief for how they capture people there lol.",5vv1qh

She's meant to be the only one on his side other than Rod. By contrast, the brother plays the direct version of outwardly aggressive, racist, and the parents are the awkward, but ""I guess they're not completely racist but kind of ignorant"" types.](#spoiler)

Whether you thought it succeeded in doing that or not, is obviously up to you, but I think that was definitely the intention and very specifically the reason why we could be led that way with him falling victim for that long.

de80h3w,"Nice rant. I think the message works best if you don't take it too seriously - basically, the idea is that ""nice"" racism is just as bad as the mean kind. Any time people are treating you differently due to your race, it's wrong. Not referring to things like affirmative action (obviously beyond the scope of this film >_<), but individual interactions where the person is either putting you down or puffing you up just because you're black. That's the main takeaway I got from it, but I'm sure everyone has their own feelings.

de8ygj5,"The entire meaning of the first two acts change once the twist is exposed. For one, the entire family and their friends were putting on a stage play for Chris. The two maidservants are the patriarchs of the family, and they lived as such as to not garner suspicion from outsiders. No one at the party, including the family, was racist or thought black people were inferior. They simply wanted to relive their lives in genetically superior bodies. 

>  A scene that especially pissed me the fuck off was when he was looking through the photos in the cupboard and putting the pieces together that his girlfriend was in on it the whole time. You can see in his expression when looking at in shots right after that he is paranoid of her. Yet for some reason once he gets downstairs he all of a sudden forgets those incriminating photos and lets her take possession of the keys and yells at her like a moron for a couple of minutes.

At this point in the movie, the audience is not aware of Rose's true affiliation with her family or the brain-transfer surgery. There are still some questions to be answered. For one, it was very possible that Rose herself was hypnotized by the mother to lure black men and women to her home. 

Also, the entire dinner party take a different meaning once the twist had occurred. Asides from the token Japanese dude, everyone was simply sizing Chris, and not black people, up. 

The film's themes revolve around cultural appropriation, exploitation, and commercialization of black culture. As well as the dangers of success. ",5vv1qh

I mean would you rather die forever or transfer consciousness

>Chris just overlooks too many obvious things. This leads him down a pretty predictable road until the very end when suddenly he gets an idea and everything just gets resolved within a couple minutes.

This is potentially fair I wouldnt necessarily agree but I can see where your coming from

>I know the TSA stuff was supposed to be funny, but it just fell flat. Some other parts of the movie, I don't think were meant to be funny, like audience reaction to Chris finding pics of his girlfriend with a bunch of other black guys.

First off the audience reaction to chris finding pics of black guys was definitely a your theater thing, me and everyone I watched it with got real tense then, second I thought tsa guy was hilarious but humor is subjective so take that for what its worse.

>Chris's backstory with his mom doesn't seem to play a mechanical role in anything that actually happens. I suppose one could say the mom uses it against him or some crap, but see five for my thoughts on what makes that irrelevant.

What do you mean? He stops in the road because he hit a deer (like his mom got hit with a car) and he stops and gets georgina because he doesnt want her to die like his mom did.

>Forced hypnosis. Come on bro, come on. It's not happening, and at this early point in the movie it jarred me fully out of liking the film. It irrevocably ruined a little bit of it for me, because it was so stupid. And in the end, it turns out to be mostly irrelevant since hypnosis wasn't the end goal.

Look I really dont get your problem with this is at all. Like you dont think hypnosis is an acceptable thing to make up in universe or that it was forced because it wasnt really, chris sat down and started talking to her mom then her mom used this to hypnotize him after talking about a deeply tramautic event. 

EDIT: Also the hypnosis certainly was relevent it allowed him to go into the sunken place whenever she spun the spoon in the cup, which was used at least three seperate times after the first hypnosis. The end goal isnt hypnosis its putting chris's conscious in the sunken place so they can transfer the brains without issue.

I also dont think cultural appropriation at all was a theme in this film.

I also dont see how you could see the movie as sexist or racist, its talking about racism in many different forms not the low hanging ""white poeple are better"" ones that we see so often in media, even chris was being racist in the film.",5vv1qh
de8xbi0,"This is a decent critique of the film, and I understand your perspective. I will however completely disagree with issue #1.

The transplanted foks were behaving was ""zombie-like"" IMO. They're behaving in ways that they think will relax Chris. Remember, technically they are all elderly white people in the inside, and since they have no knowledge of the black experience, they think that ""Golly Ol' Boy. Nothing Wrong Here, Massa"" schtick is it. 

Perfect example of this: When Chris deflected the Asian man's question to Logan and he gave a textbook Uncle Tom answer.

It's impossible for us to know how the transplanted folks acted for the remaining 364 days out the year when a visiting black person wasn't present. My guess is that grandma and grandpa sit eating meals with the rest of the family and talk about whatever it is white people do at the dinner table.",5vv1qh

de8z3ex,"> The way the transplanted people behave.

While I did walk away from the theater feeling like this was one of the best horror movies I've seen from the last 5 years (I *really* like psychological horror okay?) I also felt a bit lukewarm on the transplanted people at the end. However, I think this isn't really a fault of the movie, I think we overlooked some crucial details in our attachment to the [""slave""](#spoiler) theory the movie is hinting at from the beginning.

I think I'll have to watch it again to be sure, but I think that normally the transplanted people probably have [better body autonomy and such than what we see in the film. Probably having Chris around and going through all the motions that lead up to their capture is triggering the people stuck inside to fight back for control of the body, or something, causing all the sluggish movement and weird crying and stuff. But also, I think part of the weird zombie like quality might be accounted for by the fact that it's the mind of an elderly white person in the body of a young black person. We expect those people to talk differently, so while it might seem relatively ""normal"" (even though all the old white people in the movie are pretty nuts to begin with lol) coming out of an old white body, when those same words and mannerisms come out of a young black body, it seems weird and zombie-like.](#spoiler) Not to mention for a lot of the movie I was really attached to the [slave](#spoiler) theory, so going back knowing who the [grandma and grandpa](#spoiler) are will probably feel like a whole different movie.

Not to mention even if the procedure really is a bad deal for the transplants, I think it could still be taken symbolically as a commentary on how dumb and ineffective racism can be in the first place. Like, some people obviously do it because [any body other than their own is an improvement over their current body](#spoiler), but other people seemed to genuinely think that [being black would help them](#spoiler). It could be commentary on how white people are so attached to their racist ideas that they'll go through with it beyond all reason, even if it doesn't help them in any way.

Anyway, I think ultimately understanding the transplants might take me a couple of watches. You could argue that a good movie should deliver on the first watch, but I think it's common especially in psychological horror to walk away confused after the first watch through or two. For me, that's part of what I love about the genre.",5vv1qh

Cultural appropriation IS a complicated issue, but I think it's interesting that you interpreted the movie's message as being so antagonistic to your own views and couldn't enjoy it as a result.

Get Out was very well paced. The obvious comparison is to Hitchcock. A slow rising tension with a big climax. Lots of beats. 

They say that there are only 7 types of stories so the idea of a story being bad because it is predictable is a shallow criticism. A story fails because it's not told well. For the most part, nothing happens in Get Out that you don't expect and in terms of the social context, it is a pretty straight forward parable about race relations in America.

White terrorists committing mass shootings have been arrested and had their crimes go to trial, whereas there have been several instances in just the past few years of unarmed black men being shot for alleged petty crimes. I think the argument people are making here isn't that only a black guy would be wrongfully accused of murdering the entire family based on how the situation looked to an outsider, but rather that black people are USED to feeling more threatened when the cops show up, because even if the truth is on their side, they might not get the chance to go to court to prove themselves innocent.

Other movies do it better, but something like that being competently tackled in a generic horror movie is kind of rare.

To further explain:
The maid, groundskeeper and Andre all act extremely ""white"" in a way that contrasts against Chris and makes him feel alienated right off the bat. When it's later revealed that [their bodies are being possessed by rich white people and used as meat puppets to further their own ends, while their true selves are left without control of their life](#spoiler), well, the metaphor for rich white people using the popularity of black media/social movements for their own ends starts to really set in. It also manages to be a metaphor for black people feeling like they have to adhere to some preconceived notion of whiteness to fit in with American culture at large. All this is even further contrasted against Chris not even being a black stereotype. He's just a completely normal big city hipster archetype who only seems to seek out the other black people because he wants to talk with someone that'll treat him less weird than Mr ""I have a deep appreciation for your culture I swear I voted for Obama"". 

The blind art dealer fleshes out the above even further when he explains the [various reasons that specifically black people are chosen for the body snatching process, which range from perceived physical superiority at a genetic level, a fetish for the exotic or simply wanting to be the race that is perceived as being in vogue](#spoiler)

There's also that the entire movie right up until the finale heavily plays into the theme of people from different cultures having trouble communicating because both sides are too focused on treating someone according to their culture instead of just treating them like a normal person.

This feels like one of those movies where the themes, metaphors and symbolism are layered so deep and specifically vague that everyone will miss something though. Almost to the point of it being a detriment. If it wasn't for the climate it was being released in, it probably wouldn't have made nearly as many waves.",5vv1qh

That scene where Chris talks to the groundskeeper was really odd, and then you realize he's an old white dude basically overplaying his part.

I think the brother was wasted, and basically one step away from screaming ""hey dude you're fucked, we're gonna steal your body!"".

I do appreciated the twist in a sense, in that it made the crux of the plot something *OTHER* than ""hehe racism because white people are superior, hehe"" which is as lower common denominator of an antagonist in a story about race as possible, and instead turned it into something I totally did not expect.

*BUT* after that original thought, I agree with you completely. The only explanation they gave was they wanted to be in bodies of people who were ""stronger"" or ""faster"" or ""trendy"" (oh please on that last one, considering racism still exists and as a white man, all you need to for to be trendy is simply wear flannel and grow a handlebar mustache), and so they sort of chose black people, consistently, over the last 2 or 3 generations... like really? It's quite the stretch.

That being said I appreciated the suspense, the mix of humor, the fact that for some time we were unsure if Allison Williams character was innocent, or in on it. Then if she is ""in on it"" is she hypnotized or acting of her own free will due to her crazy family? Then even after she is ""in on it"" it seems she is acting freely, only to see her in pure psychopath form later and wondering yet again if she is hypnotized.

deeyas8,"To add to what other people are saying, it also falls in line with the theme throughout the movie of innocuous, upper-middle-class white things being made threatening. The use of the bingo cards to make bids, the lacrosse stick, the bocce ball, the deer head. Even the use of science and pairing the obvious benefits of the procedure for the white people--dude gets his vision and vitality back--with the loss for the minority characters plays into the history of exploiting black folks in order to make life better for white folks. 

These are all things that white people view as non-threatening and even beneficial in the case of science, whereas that is not necessarily the case with black folks. Black people have long been used as guinea pigs for scientific advancement. 

The biggest point of the movie was to juxtapos ""white"" people's interpretations of things with a different perspective. Even the ending with the cop fell in line with that. There's a reason Rose said ""Help me"" when the cop pulls up and there's a reason Chris puts his hands up as if he's guilty. It's because we all know that in a real life situation, Chris would have bee shot no questions asked by a cop and that Rose would have instantaneously been given the benefit of the doubt. The way it's arranged, the movie forces white people to recognize that they have these expectations--that they know how this situation would have played out because we've all seen the viral videos. It's designed to make you approach cops in the defensive way that black people have had to learn to approach cops regardless of their guilt or innocence. ",5vv1qh
deeyba3,I took it as a symbol of WASP. Typically tea is a stereo-typical white English people. All of the items he used to kill/seen around the house were white stereotypes.

The reasons varied with each individual, but they were all forms of racism.",5vv1qh
degmd6z,"You see, but it did revolve around a racist family. We believe and are used to (especially in Hollywood films) examples of racist families who follow a particular guideline. One involving some racial slurs, outright insults, and probably some bullshit Southern accent, (not saying all people with Southern accents are racist, but just that that's usually how racists are depicted and what we associate with racism in America.) This is of course lie though, racism runs rampant through America in very different forms. Many people tend to deny their own racist tendencies, and that's what Keele especially calls out: he uses his platform and storytelling skills to call out one of the most harmful forms of racism: the one we deny, the subtle, the structural, so on and so forth. Throughout the film, especially in his dialogue, Keele is pointing out ""the monster of racism [that] lurks underneath that conversation.” Peele is addressing America's ""postracial lie"" not throughout stereotypical Southern accents and obvious bullshit, but through ""conversations that make it clear who belongs and who comes from outside."" This is Keele's way of calling no-bullshit on the part of America that believes that they are not racist in their subtle yet strong micro-aggressions, implicit biases, and condescension towards POC. It's actually genius, and very much needed in a country where many deny their racist tendencies. We're a product of our society, and to deny we're all racist is to deny that we can ever make progress. I won't even begin an analysis on the countless metaphors and underlying tones throughout the rest of the film, but this film was definitely about racism in America.

Usually we see super strong or supernatural killers killing victims in increasingly ridiculous ways over the years to keep up entertainment (as an aside I've seen people say they were uncomfortable with audience cheering the kills but I feel like audience laughs or cheers for one or two deaths in a good horror movie). 

In this case the protagonist is the one using the same ""genetically superior"" (not my words, from movie) body the antagonists coveted to easily overpower and kill them. (I know Chris had to be smart to get the brother to kick the door but the brother also had the element of surprise and got Chris in a choke hold pretty quickly, had roles been reversed the larger stronger Chris would have had the brother unconscious quickly.)

Edit: Now that I think of it this is also a horror trope. The brother comes back to attack again after we thought he was dead which is a really common one, but also there is usually someone who tries to stop the killer/monster and gets the drop on them before being overpowered and killed. 
End edit

We also see a subversion of the ""last girl"". Usually she survives and we cheer her killing the monster/killer. Here we want Chris (in role of killer at this point of movie) to kill her and escape because of a sense of justice/revenge and not wanting her to survive to hurt others. In the end the police pull up to stop the killer and save the last girl as we would see in a horror movie, but this time it's actually rod there to save Chris.",5vv1qh

His upper body was not restrained and he could reach down to either arm to bite the restraints. So he could definitely have plugged an ear with his finger. However, he couldn't have plugged both ears. That's where the cotton stuffing comes into play. 

Also recall that he's being monitored and is probably being scrutinized closely when the hypnosis is triggered. Couldn't have gotten away with plugging his ears with his fingers, even if he was physically capable of it. He had to stuff his ears in advance and act like the hypnosis trigger worked.

They weren't slaves.  They were doing everything they wanted to do.  There's hints about that before the big reveal.

-Dean tells Chris that ""mom was always in the kitchen, cleaning, making sure her house was immaculate.  It's as if there's still a little piece of her here.""  So basically the grandma was the type of person who *enjoys* cleaning and takes a lot of pride in the appearance of her home.  That's a lot different from a servant/slave who is forced to cook and clean.

-The grandma wasn't actually doing housekeeping work at the party, Missy was.  When Chris is taking photos he sees Missy come out of the kitchen and hand Georgina a tray of food and drinks, implying that Georgina didn't actually make the food, Missy did.  That's not normal if you hired a cook/housekeeper.

-The Grandma's very last words, after she knew Chris killed several of her family members, were ""YOU RUINED MY HOUSE!""  She cared more about her house getting messed up that her grandson getting beat gen to death.  That's how obsessed this lady was with housekeeping and cleanliness.

-The Grandpa was an Olympic athlete who enjoys doing work outdoors.  When Chris comments on all the hard manual labor he's doing, the Grandpa genuinely smiles and says ""it's nothing I don't already want to be doing!""  He's doing all this physical work because he couldn't do it for years with his frail old body and now he's enjoying what it's like to be young again.",5vv1qh
dhhujso,">And were the kids slightly brainwashed too?  Or did the girl just go from ""normal"" to ""look at me eating single frootloops abd sipping milk through a straw like a crazy person"" just to make it clear she was bad.

I think the point was this was supposed to be unclear... throughout the whole film. It added A LOT (pretty much everything) to the suspense. You're always wondering (1) is she totally innocent and doesn't realize what's happening here OR (2) she's ""in on it"" and luring people here for that sole purpose? And if that is true, is it because of (2a) she is brainwashed through hypnotism, or (2b) she is acting freely b/c she was raised by this fucked up family? Then as the story progresses she does a great job of convincing us of (1). But then as he found her old photos and she couldn't find her keys, we know that (2) is the truth but we don't know if it's (2a) or (2b). Then later when we see turtleneck wearing, fruit loop milk sipping GF, *and* we see that she was a young child in the video with Grandpa introducing the ""program"" we can *assume* (2b), but even then we can't be certain 100%. So it left the suspense waving back and forth through to the end.

If you watch the movie again, try this: Whenever the grandmother and grandfather are engaging in any activity on screen, mentally switch them out with white grandparents. Does anything change?

See, the movie gives you the illusion that the grandma is the maid, but really...she's a grandma. She busies herself with making sure everyone's got a full glass and making sure they all feel welcome. She bakes the cake and brings it out during the party. We never actually see her cleaning, we just assume she is.

The grandpa is doing yardwork using a push mower, dressed the way a grandpa would be who likes to do yardwork. But when we see him for the first time, we instantly think ""He's the help,"" because he's a black person doing yardwork at the home of a white family. Peele hides the secret in plain sight in a way that is brilliant.

Because they were elderly rich white people who were attempting to present as younger black people and they were really bad at it. At least until Chris was strapped to that chair, they were being careful not to do anything that tipped him off that something wasn't right. They were only moderately successful, because they were old rich white people with no clue how black people talk to each other at all, much less how black people talk to each other when white folks aren't around.

> They definitely acted as though they were slaves under a hypnotic spell and not some normal grandparents who happened to be living in the bodies of black people.

deu3v4l,"This was my favorite part of the film, on multiple levels.

First, we connect Chris's original trauma (when he allowed his mother to die in a hit and run while he sat at home and watched tv) to his ability to get free. We see in the many cuts flashing back to his mothers death that Chris is paralyzed--except for a frantic clawing at the bedposts. Flash forward to Chris restrained in the basement. The hypnosis backfires, as the saving grace of being hypnotized is that it sends him back into the moment of his mother's death, which forces his hands to frantically claw--this time at the leather chair, revealing the cotton underneath. We never see it, but he picks the cotton, puts it in his ears, and is able to thwart the hypnosis to eventually escape.

On another level, the connection to cotton picking gives the movie a much deeper historical and racial relevance that ties the experience of African Americans to Chris. The deeply-embedded trauma of being the descendants of slaves is inherent in all AA's. That it is what saves Chris is an allegory that I'm sure many AA's can appreciate as they struggle with present-day conditions.

I think the suggestion is that white people can't keep AA's trapped in their historical trauma, and that it is the very fact of that trauma that will set them free.",5vv1qh

1) it isn't on that list you posted.

2) there is a bunch of bullshit titles on that list (including a concert video of Justin Timberlake)

3) Rotten Tomatoes' ""tomatometer"" works as a binary function, i.e. either the reviewer liked it or didn't. It doesn't require every review to be ""glowing"". So what the tomatometer is telling you is that nearly 100% of reviewers have said ""worth watching""

4) this is the biggest point: It's not being judged against Citizen Kane, it's being compared to movies in a similar genre, namely horror, a genre that is so fucking stagnant that parodies of horrors are more successful than actual horrors. So it's nice to have an actual thoughtful horror, that makes you feel uncomfortable and conscious, rather than relying on cheap jump scares, and one that actually gets more interesting and terrifying as the movie plays out. 

Honestly, the film is undeniably good, the vast majority disagree with you. And it's beyond stupid to attribute the positive reception to ""SJW's"".

There is also the other black guy who is still a missing person(that the police didn't seem to care about in the movie), and who they can trigger a lapse with flash photography.

Racism is commonly defined as prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.

They clearly don't view black people as having rights equal to themselves but they also have the view that in some cases black people are superior (physically, for example).

But that definition is racism as in a act of racism not the philosophy known as Racism. The correct definition for the school of thought is the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.

difj1jc,"It's beautifully shot and definitely has some really good elements. Pacing is good, hit the classic horror movie ""just when you thought you were out....""  moments perfectly when in many movies it leaves you saying ""aww c'mon"" when that same element is done 3 or 4 times.  

I think the acting was overall solid, I think the few times that seemed threadbare it might have been the script rather than the delivery.  Peele really understands movie structure and story telling i think. Nothing about this movie left me wondering the big questions of ""where are they?"" ""who is that?""   ""wait, but I thought."" the unintended questions that show a failure to communicate with the audience.

Peele really wanted this to be racially provocative, in the alternate ending where the hero goes to prison, he felt that drove it home.  Just hearing Peele talk about this ending and how the Trump administration's rise and controversy led him to change it to a more upbeat less ""we need to talk"" ending, makes me think his politics are just a little superficial and preachy.  At least when he stands there and just states them.  What I saw in the film was a few stereotypical statements about white people and their attitude toward black people, but then the horror element almost transcended. He even says ""why black people?"" and the art dealer sort of shrugs, for himself in particular.   

This does two things, it addresses what the director feels is a drowning or appropriation of black culture, achievement, in whiteness. There is definitely a discussion there. However, if his aim was to drive home the racial lack of value between whites and blacks, personhood, I felt this almost served to undercut this message and say ""we're just doing this because we can and the black thing isn't really that crucial"" while leaving the novelization of blackness as sort of a ""this is the thing to do at the moment.

I agree with everyone who says it was still the black guy and he hadn't switched back into the grandfather yet, and he knew he would soon switch back and have to keep living as this evil old white guy so he took the opportunity to kill himself.

However, it could also work if he'd already turned back into the grandfather, but knew his whole family was dead, his whole fucked up 'business' was over and he had just shot his granddaughter, so he might figure, it's over, this body will get old and die eventually too, might as well end it.

 Outside of that, I'm sure some of the scenes you have questions about were driven more by creative decision to add to the cinematic experience than to be over-analysed (Peele said on his interview on Nerdist that his main goal was to create an entertaining piece of film) but here's the best I can make sense of them: the grandpa running at night was clearly intended to add confusion for the viewer but I like the theory elsewhere in this thread that the grandparents were recently transplanted so they are enjoying the use of their new bodies. The scene where everyone goes silent when Chris goes upstairs is clearly meant to signal to the audience that there is something not right about this gathering and he is the focus.

Schultz (and thereby Django) technically 'owned' Broomhilda at the end of dinner. Django had accomplished his goal, but we as an audience still didn't have vengeance. Similar to Inglorious Bastards, Tarantino had followed the rules of history up until the final act, albeit with some allowances.

In what I feel is an echo to Tarantino's wishes, Schultz says ""I'm sorry - I couldn't resist"" after shooting Candy. Without reading too much into this, there isn't a real reason for Schultz to screw up their plan and deviate from their status quo. His death was the catalyst for Django to go all out.

To me, Django is as much a story about the evolution of Schultz as it is Django. Schultz pulling the trigger first is better than Django pulling the trigger first, because Schultz was basically an unbiased observer who decides ""This is wrong. He must die.""",5vv1qh

The grandparents weren't being forced to do the work, they did it because they're fastidious old people.  When Chris asks Walter/Grandpa about all the chores he does, Walter/Grandpa responds ""Nothing I don't want to be doing!"" with a cheerful smile on his face.  Georgiana/Grandma takes a LOT of pride in the cleanliness of her house, the Dad specifically mentioned that the grandmother was ""always cleaning in the kitchen"" so often that ""there's still a little piece of her here.""  In fact Georgiana/Grandma's last words were ""YOU RUINED MY HOUSE!""  She was more upset about the house being messed up than her own family being killed.  We know they were young during the depression bc the grandpa competed in the '36 olympics, and people who survived the depression typically do have that attitude.

IMO the grandma and grandpa kept being fastidious workers in their new bodies because that's what they were always like for their whole lives, but when they got too old their bodies couldn't keep up with the activity that they wanted to do.  Also keep in mind that Andre/Logan wasn't cooking/cleaning/etc., probably because Logan never did that in his old body either.

Chris was a bad ass in the end because he is young, fit, and filled with gallons of adrenaline, not because he is black. While I admit there are no morally good white characters in the movie, I don't see how the isolated group we were shown can be seen as a statement on white people as a whole. Same for the black characters. I personally think you're looking at it with the intent to see these problems, which is skewing your perception.

def0fct,"I vehemently disagree with your opinion. I think the movie went a long way to encourage the audience to make excuses for Rose. Time and again in this thread, people have said that they expected Rose to not knowingly be taking part in the ""family business"", that she was instead being hypnotized by her mother into forgetting that she was dating these black men. That then runs right into when the cop car pulls up at the end, and you as the audience realize that in a real situation like this, Rose would absolutely get the benefit of the doubt and Chris would likely be shot before any questions were even asked. You, as the audience, are encouraged to make excuses for the innocent white woman which then sets you up to realize how white people are given the benefit of the doubt in real life situations like interactions with cops. 

Most of the white people at the party are not blatantly and openly racist--instead they are saying things that white people actually say to black people that are racially motivated and assumptive and are problematic. Even though in this case, those people were considering buying Chris, the point that it's drawing attention to is that oftentimes white people interact with black people as if they are a dimensionless, stereotypical charicature. While those things are tied to ill intentions in the movie, when they are first introduced, they are shown in the realistic way in which they actually occur. The brilliance of the movie is in the fact that these views of black people are taken to an extreme: sure, no one who asks about the virility of black men is hoping that their old husband's brain can be put into his body. But they are implying that they are interested in exploiting black men for sex. To say that they are ""just psychopathic"" is to miss the fact that Peele just took *real* issues and extended them to an extreme. Everything the white characters said was double speak--meant both to placate the lone black person in their midst but also to convey their internal thoughts, hopes, and beliefs about him. 

To say it devolves into a race revenge flick is to do a disservice to Chris as well. That dude wanted to get out of there first and foremost; he wasn't interested in killing everyone. This is evidenced primarily by the fact that he leaves the house without trying to find Rose and only ends up trying to kill her when she chases him with a shotgun. It's also embodied by the *exhaustion* that he exudes during the whole last act. While he's terrified, and you can see that, underlying every action he takes is a complete lack of surprise that this is how the weekend turned out. He didn't expect it to take such a dark turn, but his whole life has prepared him to adapt to the racism of white people. Remember, Roy told him so. ",5vv1qh

It was race-driven. Instead of centering the movie around conservative racists hating black people, it was about liberal racists that view black people as novelties. It was an exaggeration of how people talk about how much they love black people, out of 'white guilt'. 

> The comedy felt extremely forced. The TSA guy was way too much for me with all the 'sex slave' stuff and just over the top goofiness. The scene in the police station was excruciating. This movie was essentially a 'scary movie' written in between some Key and Peele type comedy skits.

I liked the comedy. I wouldn't even say this is a horror movie. Its more of a thriller but the best part is how it combines various genres together. 

> The two servants were actually the grandparents of the family. So why did they act like they didn't know what the hell they were doing? Did they just do the transplant? Seems like they should have been acclimated to their new bodies by then. What was the apology scene with Georgiana all about? Was that the ""real"" Georgiana trying to come out and warn the main character? That was confusing. The man (grandpa) who was running in the dark, why?

If you go back and see it, you see they are acting like senile 'old people'. The grandpa running in the dark or the woman constantly looking at herself in the mirror was them 'enjoying' their new body. Like, they had been trapped in 'old people' bodies and now they had these ones where they could do all of this manual labour they could never do before. 

> Why was the closet door open at the end? And after the main character found the pictures of his girlfriends with the the maid/servant why did he expect her to hand over the keys? It was obvious that the girlfriend was in on it at that point.

The point was, he was trying to 'play it cool' and pretend he didnt know until he was out of the house. So he was hoping that his girlfriend would play along until they were outside at least or got away. 

> The camera flash is what wakes the bodies up into their real selves. Ok, sure. I personally think that's a little lazy but it makes sense so that's fine. But at the end, did Rose not see the camera flash go off on a pitch black rural road?

I mean all of this is extremely nit picky. The movie isn't trying to be grounded. Its a very absurd concept and is treated as such. A little bit of suspension of disbelief is necessary.

deadygs,">  I would have preferred their motives for killing people race driven or perhaps they're just psychopaths. The transferring of consciousness seemed Sci-Fi-y to me.

It was race driven but they weren't killing them; they thought blacks were genetically superiror, and thus were transplanting their minds into their bodies. 
 
>The two servants were actually the grandparents of the family. So why did they act like they didn't know what the hell they were doing? Did they just do the transplant?
 
I'd imagine it leaves them fucked up; it's not perfect *and* there's still a fragment of their host's mind still locked in there. And yes, when she was crying the real Georgina was trying to break free.  
 
>The man (grandpa) who was running in the dark, why?  
 
The grandpa started this whole thing, when he got beat in a race by Jesse Owens; he came to the conclusion that black men are genetically faster, and thus came up with the idea to take over their body; he was running because he was training. 
 
>The dad got killed by a mounted deer head.... Sure, why not.  
 
Irony. At the beginning the father says he's happy to see a deer die, because they're pests; Chris saw the dead deer symbolic to his dying mother. The father regularly hunts deer (symbolic of black people in the film), and was killed by one in the end. 
 
> And after the main character found the pictures of his girlfriends with the the maid/servant why did he expect her to hand over the keys? 
 
Denial; He talked about his not doing anything when his mom didn't come home because doing anything would make it ""real"". He denied Rose was in on it because he didn't want his situation to be ""real"". 
 
> so the TSA guy just happens to magically show up at the right place at exactly the right time. 
 
The last scene Rod was in showed him doing detective work, trying to figure out both where Chris was, and what the hell was going on; It'd make sense for him to show up in the end.",5vv1qh
deadwxt,"Going to answer some of your points:

* Yes, the apology scene was the 'real' Georgina trying to come out. Slivers of the original people in the host bodies are left, but all they can feel is disgust and horror. Georgina is shown to be the only one who is able to actively resist, since her transplantation was likely the first one and 'imperfect'. The imperfectness is shown during the scene where the family and Chris are sitting and drinking iced tea; the sound of the glass clinking causes Georgina to jump and briefly take back control before the mom starts talking again. The box was also left by Georgina on purpose, likely in a moment of lucidity.

* The father explains that the grandfather had been beaten by Jesse Owens during the 1936 Olympic trials and that ""He almost got over it."" Due to this Grandpa believed that black bodies were better at physical activity than white bodies. Hence the running; he **never** got over it.

* During one of the earlier scenes the dad mentions how much he hates deer. Poetic irony; he's killed by something he hates. Additionally Chris watches as the deer their car hit dies; the taxidermy deer head watches as Chris saves himself.

* Rose was not present during the first ""wakeup"" so she likely did not know about camera flashes breaking hypnosis.",5vv1qh

Seriously? In THIS day and age? people are jumping at the bit to aggressively display their racism for any slight. heck, i even read this morning how brietbarters are turning on each other if they're not 'militant' enough in their beliefs. So no, i don't believe the 99% RT score is out of obligation. As u/YourAverageJet said, you're entitled to subjective likes/dislikes, but to suggest people are raving about it out of obligation is beyond odd. I'm white and I thought it was brilliant - so much so, I came to r/movies to read all the symbolism Peele put in script that went over my head. for instance, yes I knew he was going to put the cotton in his ears, but it didn't occur to me until u/thetacobellvampire pointed out he was freed by picking cotton.

So I felt like he took very real scenarios and played on them, making them into a thriller/horror but still keeping it light with some comedy.

I think you're missing the point of the movie to be honest. The racism that was showcased in the movie was the kind most people don't associate with ""real racism"". It wasn't the old Southerner or The_donald type racism, it was subtle societal based racism that may come more from ignorance than malice. It's the kind of racism you usually not focused on in films. No black person fears that kind of racism.

If you made a movie where the races were reversed it wouldn't work because it wouldn't reflect our society.  Don't you understand that the Armitage family was a satirical take on sanctimonious white liberals?  Peele said in an interview after the film's premiere at Sundance that he got the idea for the script from the behavior of condescending white Clinton supporters during the 2008 democratic primary.  If you reversed the races in *Get Out* it wouldn't be social commentary anymore because you don't have wealthy black families with ""black guilt"" over the historical oppression of white people.

dfgec58,">Why bother having Rose seducing them and working on each one for months? Wouldn't it make more sense to just kidnap them like they did at the beginning of the movie with André?

Rose *did* seduce Andre, he was on his way to meet her when he got suspicious.  Remember how he's talking to his girlfriend on the phone (later revealed to be Rose)?  He was supposed to go straight to meet her but he went to the wrong street by accident.  As she's giving him directions he starts to comment that he gets a ""creepy feeling"" and something doesn't feel right, and shortly after that remark Jeremy's car starts following him.  However, Jeremy doesn't get out or the car to attack Andre until Andre tried to run away.  Just like how Jeremy doesn't attack Chris with the lacrosse stick until Chris tried to leave the house.

We know that Rose's family listens in on her phone calls with victims bc we see this happening during her call with Roy.  What I gather is that once they heard Andre express that he felt creeped out and suspicious they sent Jeremy to watch his movements.  Then Jeremy was ready to sedate Andre when he tried to leave.

They can't just kidnap random people because the brain transplants only works if the victim is sent to ""the sunken place,"" and they can only get there through hypnosis.  You can't hypnotize an unwilling person.  They have to make the victim comfortable enough to voluntarily undergo hypnosis, which isn't gonna happen to a terrified kid napping victim.",5vv1qh

That scene was still brilliant though, and I love how it didn't just turn once, or twice, but more like four or five times.

First you might get that initial ""oh phew, police are here"" reaction, but either you already know what the scene is implying, or a fraction of a second later it hits you, with that blatant framing. You watch in suspense as the car door opens, and then breathe a sigh of relief as you see the black hand, but then you realize, ""wait, what if the sheriff was one of those sickos?"" But then it's just the T-S-motherfucking-A.

Yet the guests still had the auction, outside, where Chris and Rose could see. That seems like a big risk to take if all the information you have on the person you are auctioning is ""they're fucking around here somewhere, just walking."" 

That's when it clicked for me that she was in on it too. Then everything she did prior to that made sense. The scene with the cop. The convo she had with Chris about the groundskeeper (grandfather).

Also - the White people in the film are liberal racists who don't realize they're racists.

He did ask her earlier in the movie if she'd ever dated a black man before and she said ""no.""  Assuming he remembered this (and it'd be a pretty weird thing for him to forget given the context), he'd have at least known she lied to him or was brainwashed into forgetting.  And it seems like he is at least thinking this because he insists on leaving immediately and does not wait for her to find the keys before heading downstairs.

At best you could say he is initially putting it out of his head and hoping she's still on his side, but as the family draws increasingly closer it becomes more and more clear that she's not going to ""find"" them and that trying to rush her is an exercise in futility, which is reflected by him becoming more and more agitated and demanding.",5vv1qh

It isn't a family of KKK members, it's a family who's father proudly proclaims that he voted for Obama twice. The film is an indictment of white liberals, white guilt and virtue signaling.

If you view the cop as a representation of conservative policing policies, his methods seem harsh, but he was not overtly racist and was merely doing his job by asking for ID, and this could have potentially saved Chris's life. I think this mirrors current policing discussions, namely that some people claim that stop and frisk and broken windows policies DO make communities safer, and liberal policies protect criminals and actually hurt urban neighborhoods.

Not exactly a sunshine experience 4) Japanese internment camps happened. 5) Asians are not just one race --considering there are 48 countries and the article says we are 5.8% in  America, how exactly can you generalize that sort of statistic. If a  korean american has a cultural experience totally different from a Pakistani American then would you expect any Asian American to overlap with a Black American in totality? 6) Indian Americans and black Americans lived in harmony and intermarried during civil rights movements; Ex: Malcolm X found solidarity with Asian Muslims/ Dr. martin Luther King Jr. inspired by Gandhi's peaceful protests against the British and sought to emulate it in America. 7) therefore as a minority group we stand with black people I don't see why Asian-Americans owe any other minority group anything at all as that article suggested. 

I think the movie added the East Asian guy because they tried to show a clinical approach of comparing against minorities. In real life people claim ""why can't black americans be like the ""model minority"" that is Asian Americans. What people don't realize is that they do this to distract from real issues that black Americans face---and just like in the movie, that article shows that the distracting factor has worked.

deznshp,"My ex-husband's parents are in their late 70's and early 80's, not bad people, but have no urge to take in new media or learn new things.

dgmjz3m,I did think so,5vv1qh
dgn2kq5,"Spoilers below,

I don't really see it as racist.  I see it more as satire.  Really good writing satire which took elements from other movies.  Took elements from society as it is today. This movie rings more like a Twilight Zone episode than some movie with racism.  It's science fiction with comedy.

It is a movie ultimately, it has nothing to do with reality.  On the other hand, It does have connotations of a joke that white people like rap music and black culture.  Along with some creepy hypnosis and neurosurgeon.    

I'd put this in the Outer Limits/Twilight Zone/Black Mirror field of sci-fi more than a movie made to create a racist agenda.   

If you just want to see things in black and white, go for it, no one is stopping you. That just isn't the case in this movie.  It's quite genius actually.   Peele is really talented considering he directed it. 

Also, I'm a white person who doesn't hate himself because of ""superior genetics"" and a small penis.  I doubt anyone got that, but go ahead and try.",5vv1qh

diea3lt,"I thought that as well, but I'm glad they didn't go that route. I feel it would have lacked some punch at the end if the two escaped together, especially since he'd have just killed her parents. ""Awake"" or not that's still going to be traumatic and would be a weird note to end on. Having her as the last villain - and a creepy one at that, after her ponytail shift and milk-white style - worked really well. ",5vv1qh

debvy6x,"this.  jordan peele mentioned, on some interview on youtube (i've watched many so forgive me i can't remember which one lol, probably build or nerdist) that he's treating his audience like they're intelligent...  he hates when horror movie character do stupid things, like run upstairs instead of out the front door?  so he said he wanted his audience to not only root for chris but have him actually  do the stuff audiences usually yell at the screen",5vv1qh

de9ey1c,So you mean like objectification is racism too?,5vv1qh
deazbrv,Yes please,5vv1qh
deb7pvq,Rod was the Key & Peele in the movie. The plot I feel like came from an idea from Jordan that he just decided to run with. Possibly from a sketch that he just thought could be bigger than a sketch,5vv1qh
defwg70,Some people noticed the symbolism of Chris protecting himself from the hypnosis by stuffing the cotton from the chair into his ears - he freed himself by picking cotton. Haven't listened to the podcast but I assume Peele confirms that this was intentional symbolism,5vv1qh

A lobotomy was classically used to treat mental disorders such as depression or schizophrenia. A piece of the brain that controls emotional regulation was often removed causing the patient to feel little if any emotion at all.

dgw022b,"Your opinion is valid but I thought the movie was very good and suspenseful. Normally I'm very nitpicky with stuff like that in movies but the general pacing, camerawork and acting of this movie was so superb I was never taken out of the experience. I have never fist-pumped at a movie so much in my life, it seriously felt like a boxing match and all I wanted was for Chris to win. The way they illustrated how being trapped in hypnosis would be was so cool, especially the first time he 'sank' through the floor. The braintransplant theory was weirdly plausible and felt fine to me. I was very, very impressed by this movie.  ",5vv1qh

de8smlb,"Yeah and the part with Georgina or whatever in his car so that implies he does that after he escapes. I mean the stuff they didn't spoil was great, but man the trailer just gave away the entire movie. ",5vv1qh
de8wcdm,Yeah it kind of pisses me off because my girlfriend and I go to the movies pretty much once a week and so we saw the trailer a lot. I never went out of my way to see it but one time because of how phenomenal it was to me at the time. It's a shame. ,5vv1qh
de8wa8d,[Here it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRfnevzM9kQ) I feel like I've watched the entire movie again; it's pretty much all in order too.

dedimct,Yea  There were things at the party that hit home for me as what I hear from white people all the time.

The only party guest character we learn much about, Jim, is a NYC art dealer. Presumably he lives in Manhattan or maybe Brooklyn and not where the Armitages do. 

B. Old people die! Walter/Roman Armitage was old enough to run in the 1936 Olympics. Yet we see him in the photo and video with the Armitage family when both grandkids- Rose and Jeremy- were already at least seven or eight and those characters are now 20 somethings. So he and presumably his wife lived to quite an old age.  Nothing suspicious in their demise.
 
The woman at the party who asks Rose whether sex is ""better"" with Black men is standing next to a husband who is clearly at death's door. If she had been high bidder and he died that wouldn't have been suspicious either. 

Jim the art dealer is played by Stephen Root, who is 65. That is young to die these days of natural causes, but a heart attack at that age is hardly unheard of. 

C. Yes, they can have funerals for the white bodies. Is that hard?

D. These people are not all dying off so quickly. Andre/Logan replaced some white guy six months before the party and he's the only other Black person there. 

To some up, not necessarily from the same town, all old, and not dying all at once. Not a plot problem. ",5vv1qh

The twist in the plot wasn't that they were controlling African Americans or that Allison was in on the whole thing, but that they actually *wanted* to be African American.

Some of them might not even be as racist as we're initially led to believe. Not all characters in the movie share others' belief that Whites are generally smarter than Blacks. I loved the scene where the blind guy says that he couldn't give a shit if Chris was Black or not. I thought, 'Wow, not only are most of these guys super racist, even the ones that aren't are fucked up in the head.'

And then Georgina/grandma being in the car could represent the sliver of the original person left in the body, but there would be layers to it because it would be the consciousness of a white person in the body of a black person which is in a white car taken over by a black person. The significance of the grandma being in the car could be the relationship between Georgina's consciousness fighting back, thus leading up to her death, and the Grandma's consciousness fighting Chris for ruining her house, thus leading to her death...

I agree with what you point out. I think for me maybe the let down was the plot was pretty standard and exactly what I predicted from the trailer. So while it was solid and had lots of good points I don't think it ticked enough boxes to be considered so great.

I was also thrown off by so many people saying it was terrifying and having brilliant social commentary. It wasn't very scary except for the odd jump scare. And the social commentary side of it was well done, it could have been heavy-handed but it was handled well. However it wasn't particularly ground breaking commentary or, because of the style of movie, as deep and human as social commentary can be. It was just a bit of satire on a well-established (and true) comedy trope. And without those elements, just the good moviemaking topics you point out, it makes it a well-made movie but not something that blows me away or that I think deserves being considered perfect (as in a new classic).

It felt more like a dark comedy with elements of satire, and it's for those reasons I enjoyed it. In terms of being great social commentary or of being scary I think it wasn't that great, but those are two of the things other people (not you) keep pointing at for it being a 10/10. I think the trailer taglines of ""terrifying"" and similar probably did the movie a disservice. It's one of those times I think I'd have enjoy it more if I'd heard nothing about the movie beforehand.

As I said in another comment I think maybe rating inflation is a bit to blame. Like 7/10 is basically 5/10 and it was definitely better than average so it got lots of 9/10s and 10/10s. But when you compare it to some of the greatest movies of all time it doesn't stack up, despite having similar ratings.

Do you think this will still be a film people talk about in years to come? Except maybe for the milestones it's broken? If so why? Because I think most well-made movies are good to watch but aren't something that people love for years. It didn't have that X factor that takes it from being a solid enjoyable movie into a classic, for me anyway, but lots of people are treating it it like that. 

>. I haven't seen a lot of signs that the folks who are here saying ""It wasn't that good"" get what made it good.

The things you point out made it good and not a bad movie, I 100% agree. But, and I don't think you're saying this, some people are saying it is perfect, 10/10, a classic, etc and I don't see that. It was enjoyable and solid but seems kind of overrated for me. I'm definitely not saying it was a bad movie.

I'd recommend it to someone who was bored and wanted to go to the cinema but didn't know what to see.

Those weird conversations for the most part didn't add anything - they could have kept a few scenes and done something else instead of just repeating them in slightly different scenarios.  Even if it wasn't trying to be funny, where was the suspense - a few scenes at the end of the flick?

I think Rod is a little pointless because he doesn't actually do anything that helps Chris escape in the end. None of his detective work or theorizing is all that essential to Chris's revelation or ability to leave. I thought he was going to be the one to rescue Chris, but he ends up being relegated to comic relief. He was good comic relief and he livened up the movie, but his plotline wasn't necessary for anything else that happens, and I think he could have been integrated into the story better.

Root's character is the same way- he could just as easily have been the girlfriend's (I forget her name) father or brother or someone else at the party and it wouldn't have made a difference. Both characters seem to serve as exposition machines.

In fact, the whole thing where they're switching people's brains was poorly explained and didn't jive with what was set up before- Georgina and the other dude didn't act like rich old white people inhabiting the bodies of young black people, because you'd think they'd act more ""natural."" Instead, they come across as very stiff, overly formal and weird, more like they brainwashed the black people to be their slaves, or to be ""acceptable"" or something. 

They specifically say that Chris is going to spend the rest of his life in ""the deep place"" while Root inhabits his mind, but how does that work? We see the dad prepping neurosurgery...so is he going to take out Chris's brain and put in Root's? But then why would Chris still be in his body? How are the black people they already brainwashed able to resist? It felt like there was an earlier version of the script where the twist wasn't that they were switching people's brains but something else, and Peele later changed the twist but didn't correct the earlier parts of the script.

He leaves a trail of bodies behind him that in real life would definitely catch up to him. Affluent white family murdered by the daughter's black boyfriend? No way the media would let that go. Etc, etc.

I think the horror that Chris perseveres through all this only to be unceremoniously gunned down needs little introduction for most viewers, just because of current events.

The cause (in canon) might be that it's just the white brain acting normal/white inside the stolen black body, but, the result of this is a weird black person not a person who seems like a white person.

If the point was for them to be just acting like ""normal white"" people, the body snatched characters (Georgina, woodchopper) would have simply acted like the mother and father instead of like weirdos.

deb70uu,"Couple addenda:

Grandma/Georgina was also constantly checking mirrors to make sure her wig was covering the surgery scar.

The grandfather running was because he lost to Jesse Owens (my daughter's theory is that this is what caused him to come up with the idea.).

Rod wasn't so far off with the ""sex slave"" stuff.  Dre/Logan's wife was constantly implying that all they did was stay home and have sex, and the woman with the wheelchair bound husband with an oxygen tube kept touching Chris and asking Rose about sex with him.  So some of the buyers DID want sex slaves, just with bodies attached to someone else's brains.

Rod cracking jokes fit his character and made sense to me.  Don't get me wrong, IRL, I wouldn't actually say what he said, but I've had VERY inappropriate jokes cross my mind at moments where saying them aloud would make me terrible. A few VERY close friends and I share them.",5vv1qh

> Irony. At the beginning the father says he's happy to see a deer die, because they're pests; Chris saw the dead deer symbolic to his dying mother. The father regularly hunts deer (symbolic of black people in the film), and was killed by one in the end.

I get that too. But again, it's irony for the sake of irony. Pretty over the top and extremely unsubtle. 

> Denial; He talked about his not doing anything when his mom didn't come home because doing anything would make it ""real"". He denied Rose was in on it because he didn't want his situation to be ""real"".

Another is that the at dinner brother was asking him about what kind of martial arts he knew, and when Chris gave an ""unsatisfactory"" answer, the dad gave a really displeased grimace that chris didn't see, and there was just a general feeling that they were sizing him up.

The whole transplant process is based on the idea that black people are not living up to their full potential, and that their superior white brains could use black bodies better than an inferior black brain could. 

I think the fact that they kidnapped Black people, viewed them as objects they could buy, stole their bodies and essentially forced them to live a life of slavery proves that these people had no positive feelings towards Black people. They thought they were being well-meaning by saying things along the lines of ""I think Tiger Woods was the greatest of all time!"" or ""You must be better in bed because you have a big penis,"" but they most certainly did not view black people as equals or human beings who are deserving of empathy, freedom, respect, etc. 

Given all of that, I think the analysis of u/boysaredumb was spot on- the father does think the world would be a better place with less black people (i.e. individuals with who can think and act freely with their own brains), and more black bodies (individuals with white brains who can control black bodies).",5vv1qh

Unless Peele is making a very self-referential nod to the systemic transgressions of the ""Model Minority"" a la Hollywood big screen, then cool but the point was lost.  If anything, face value, Peele is perpetuating the very idea and concept of the ""Model Minority"" to viewers like you.

I only say this because many people boil privilege down to basically being spoiled, especially associated with experiences. (ie. You never had to deal with this, you never experienced that, etc)
As another commenter said, that actually can be a negative to those who haven't experienced some negative things but have still experienced other negative things in life, which have still made life a struggle.
Obviously not comparing broad topics here, but just when it's automatically assumed, ""Oh, you're white, so you're privileged."" Yes, that person may be white, but they also may be an orphan, may have been or are currently being abused, or may be going through our experiences a plethora of other negative things in life that make just surviving difficult.

Again, not comparing anything drastic here. Just saying that many people go through hardships in life, and having any and all of one's struggles be brushed away because one assumes that they're privileged can really demean the troubles they have overcome.

Hope that was worded okay. Really not trying to argue, just trying to further explain why ""privilege"" can actually be a negative stereotype because, like most stereotypes, it ignores and devalues who that person actually is as an individual.

The Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans are Mongoloid. The SEA are Australoid. The real problem here is that ""Asian"" is used as a race and ethnic group, rather than just to mean ""the people living in the place known as Asia.""

It's the common language that is flawed, more than anything. It's correct to say ""Asians are on average smarter"" because ""Asian"" is implicitly understood to mean Mongoloids, in the context.

deaehuu,"Yep. That's also why she already had her sob story in place - naturally, especially after Rod alerted the police - she and her family would be the first to get questioned when Chris eventually turned out to be missing. 

She was ready to tell any detectives that he got spooked, left for home, and that she hadn't seen him since. She wanted those bases covered. 

One thing that made me wonder is that if Rose has done this with other boyfriends (and girlfriend?) - how she hasn't been questioned before. Chris had a friend that knew about her, I am assuming this is the case for the others, and the SO is certainly one of the first people you'd want to talk to if someone goes missing. But normally the people who are worried are family members.

But that brings to mind Chris' background. Absent father, deceased mother. It also seems like he's a freelance photographer, so he doesn't even have a boss or colleagues that would wonder if he didn't show up to work one day. It's like she deliberately picked a person that few people would look for. ",5vv1qh

- butterfly/monarch symbolism of the video Chris is forced to watch (which is widely theorized to be about mind control or programming)

- allusions to widespread organ harvesting particularly of blacks, maybe even transhumanistic themes of being able to transport your body into another person's

- sinister motivations behind some scientists especially within the psychiatric field. It's hard for me to articulate this but the girlfriend's mother use of hypnosis to trap Chris into that void disturbed me quite a bit. People love to chastise organized religion and praise science as objective truth but in reality science and magick come from the same place.

That's my entire point, it's not all white people, it's a microcosm of isolated racist white culture. It's why Chris would feel uncomfortable  in an isolated white house in the woods, away from civilization. The only other white character that was unrelated to the family was the cop, and he was used as a tool for misdirection at the end reveal where Rod shows up (and as I mentioned the misdirection with Rose's characterization).

Are you kidding? The movie presents a metaphor of **modern day** marginalization and subjugation of black Americans. The minds in the sunken place being stifled by the overpowering white thoughts being put into them is analogous to completely current states of affairs for black people in America. For the benefit of whites, in the movie, black bodies and abilities are used for physical prowess, sex appeal, hipness, and, in the case of our protagonist, art. Correlate that to objectified professional athletes, the fetishism of race, and appropriation of culture and art.

You seriously think this movie is about pre-civil war racism? This movie addresses black people still being made to conform to a system that doesn't respect them for more than how they can be used for entertainment and profit. Saying ""Oh, its an allegory for slavery!"" is such an easy, superficial interpretation that it makes me wonder to what extent you acknowledge current racial inequality in America.",5vv1qh

I interpreted the inclusion of an Asian American man as a nod to the fact that different ethnicities face different experiences in America, and that the ""model minority"" stereotype is essentially just claiming that Asian Americans assimilate better into white culture than other minorities. I don't necessarily think that it was attempting to say that all Asian Americans aim to -be- white, but rather that Asian Americans are more readily accepted into white culture than other minorities (though, you're right in that ""Asian"" has become a catchall term that homogenizes dozens of different cultures and ethnicities, and a Pakistani American would for sure be viewed/treated differently  Korean American). That's not to say that racism against Asian Americans isn't a problem. But I do think it's important to recognize that even as minorities we can be complicit in the subjugation of another race. As an Asian American myself, I am well aware of the privileges I have that other minorities do not. I'm also well aware that being privileged can open the door to actually being racist-- many Asian cultures both in and outside of the US do have long histories of racial prejudice and colorism.

When the granddad took 'Walter's' body, I'm sure he asked questions about how athletic he was. The guy who eventually bought Chris was after his eye for photography. That's something he probably learned from 4 months of research. And Andre was a jazz musician; maybe if they got him through Rose's method, someone would've outbid Logan for his talent in that field. I'm sure some don't care and just want a new body, but there in lies the twisted genius of this movie. The black people were seen as property.

So maybe the cleanly/housewife persona was the grandma while the mirror gazing trait was from Georgina? I.e, the house is to Georgina's body as the grandma personality is to the Georgina personality.

I remember that scene where Chris was looking at her through the lens and she rushed off. She was always rushing off around Chris and always seemed nervous. Parts of me wonder if Georgina regularly came out and tried to strategically find ways to escape. This partially explaining the ""no no no"" scene- If Georgina actually did come out of trance every once and a while she'd have to act like she was still entranced, so every time she saw Chris she'd have to subtly help him escape.

I recognize the subjective platform this opinion of mine needs to rest upon because this all depends on whether white people let black people down or not.

dehjzju,"""‘The white liberal is the worst enemy to America, and the worst enemy to the black man. Let me explain what I mean by the white liberal. In America there is no such thing as Democrat or Republican anymore. In America you have liberals and conservatives.
The only people living in the past who think in terms of I’m a Democrat or Republican, is the American Negro. He’s the one that runs around bragging about party affiliation. He’s the one that sticks to the Democrat or sticks to the Republican.
But white people are divided into two groups, liberals and conservative. The Democrats who are conservative, vote with the Republicans who are conservative. The Democrats who are liberal vote with the Republicans that are liberal.
The white liberal aren’t white people who are for independence, who are moral and ethical in their thinking. They are just a faction of white people that are jockeying for power. The same as the white conservative is a faction of white people that are jockeying for power.
They are fighting each other for power and prestige, and the one that is the football in the game is the Negro, 20 million black people. A political football, a political pawn, an economic football, and economic pawn. A social football, a social pawn.
The liberal elements of whites are those who have perfected the art of selling themselves to the Negro as a friend of the Negro. Getting sympathy of the Negro, getting the allegiance of the Negro, and getting the mind of the Negro. Then the Negro sides with the white liberal, and the white liberal use the Negro against the white conservative.
So that anything that the Negro does is never for his own good, never for his own advancement, never for his own progress, he’s only a pawn in the hands of the white liberal.
The worst enemy that the Negro have is this white man that runs around here drooling at the mouth professing to love Negros, and calling himself a liberal, and it is following these white liberals that has perpetuated problems that Negros have.
If the Negro wasn’t taken, tricked, or deceived by the white liberal then Negros would get together and solve our own problems.
I only cite these things to show you that in America the history of the white liberal has been nothing but a series of trickery designed to make Negros think that the white liberal was going to solve our problems. 
Our problems will never be solved by the white man. The only way that our problem will be solved is when the black man wakes up, clean himself up, stand on his own feet and stop begging the white man, and take immediate steps to do for ourselves the things that we have been waiting on the white man to do for us. Once we do for self then we will be able to solve our own problems’""

dekcv60,"That's the point. In the film, black bodies are objectified and hypersexualized much like they are in the real world. Rose and her family satirize the point of view of typical ""non-racist"" white person who appreciates black people because of their sexual prowess or athletic ability but still fails consider their intellectual or emotional needs. 

A couple examples that stick out are when Jeremy was talking to Chris about fighting and when the woman at the party felt Chris up and asked if the sex was better. It might seem non-racist at first and an admission of black genetic superiority but it still ultimately serves to dehumanize black men. And this type of racism does far more damage than any overt hatred of blacks.",5vv1qh

dezwlu3,"I came to that same conclusion, not knowing about this interview (maybe you could get the link?), I supposed that she was the most sadistic one.  
Let me explain: The rest of the family only dealt with the black significant other for the 48 hours before he/she was to be transformed into the old white buyer.  However, Rose had to bond with that person for months before this happened.  She had to spend time with them, have sex with them, meet their friends, and all the other things that come with a relationship, and it had to seem real otherwise she wouldn't get them to meet her parents.  However, through all of this, never breaking ""character,"" she was able to switch on a dime during the ""you know I can't give these [the keys] to you"" scene.  Within minutes of sending Chris to his psychological demise, she is eating cereal and listening to ""I had the time of my life.""

I think that she left the cupboard open for him to find it just to have an extra moment of panic.

Exhibit A: During the scene when Chris goes out to have a smoke and is almost tackled by Walter and ends up being hypnotized by Missy, the first thing he sees is the open cupboard.  That is the first sign that something isn't right and he stares at it for a moment.  When he snaps out of it in bed the next morning, he thinks it was a dream.  Rose immediately asks what the dream was about and she wanted great detail.  I think she enjoyed hearing about his suffering because she knew it wasn't a dream.

Exhibit B: When Chris finally finds the box of photos, he is flipping through them so long that Rose walks in.  She knows very well what is in there and what he is looking at but instead of admitting what is going on she simply asks ""What're you doing?"" and when he lies and says he is looking for his camera, which is in plain sight on the dresser, she goes along with it and hands him the camera.  This is because she wants him to keep hope until the last second so that when she crushes it, it hurts all the more.  This could also be why she intentionally takes so long to ""find"" her keys so that she could enjoy an extra minute of Chris' panic.

All of this being said, I am very open to other interpretations as to her motive, one of the signatures of great directing IMO is that every action can be taken at least two different ways.",5vv1qh

Horror movies don't make blatant and almost racist commentaries about certain groups of people and if they did they wouldn't get away with it like this movie does. I love this hypocrisy, imagine a movie where the whole message was criticizing a certain group of people because the people who made the film had racist anxiety towards blacks? Oh, wait we do, it's called Birth of a Nation and despite how disgusting that movie is its still 10 times the film this one is because it really was a masterpiece that revolutionized cinema.

""That being said - since when are movies required""

They aren't required to do anything numb nuts. I never made that argument.

It was a discussion on how we show racism in a multitude of ways, I mean even Chris was being racist when talking about how georgina doesnt like him becuase hes dating a white girl or that he thinks that she thinks hes a race traitor, he goes up to Andre to try to feel more comfortable because hes more comfortable around black people than white people. Beyond that the film explores racism in a lot of different ways not just the standard ""[blank] race of people are superior to others"" way we see often, theres the overly niceness the dad acts around chris (""my man"" and ""I would've voted obama for a third term"") the fact a lot of people are looking up to him as being ""cooler"" or ""naturally stronger"" because hes black.

de9ayg4,"The modern racism thing is most relevant in how during the first half/two thirds of the movie, Chris isn't sure if there's actually something nefarious going on or if it's just that these people are super weirdly racist in a modern sense. ",5vv1qh
de9afla,"The modern racism was depicted in extremely exaggerated ways, so it may have come off slightly obscure. A major topic was cultural appropriation, represented by white people literally appropriating the bodies of black people and living in them. This is just surface level analysis, though, and the film's critique runs deeper. Think of how the hypnotized black people spoke and acted so white that they couldn't even manage a fist bump. Just because old rich white men steal the bodies of black people does not mean they can steal their lives, histories, culture, etc. They can play the part but it remains transparent that they aren't ""brothers.""  

It was interesting how the guests at the party were so obsessed with Chris' genetics and physical body, while completely ignoring the struggle that makes him who he is. The dominant culture wants to take without respecting or understanding what they are taking. There is a history, a reason, a cultural significance behind the things that white people take from minorities, from dreads to bindis. When taken and disrespected they lose their meaning and beauty.

The blind man who wanted Chris' eyes so that he could see the world as Chris does was bound to be sorely disappointed if the procedure was a success. He would gain eyesight, but never Chris' eyesight, because his perspective does not come from his physical body but from his history and culture (I think this is why we were shown the day his mom died—significance was added to the fact that Chris has a past that shaped him). This is an especially empowering point for the film to make.  

While on the topic of the party-goers, another aspect of modern racism shown (that was a little more obvious) was how they all had to bring up some random well-known black athlete. They seemed oblivious to the totality of black culture and basically pigeonholed black excellence as merely Jesse Owens and Tiger Woods—some of the most ""white-friendly"" black people. The guests genuinely thought they weren't racist and believed that by bringing up the adoration they have for one or two black athletes that white people accept, they'd prove their non-racism. In reality this is the equivalent of ""I'm not racist, I have a black friend."" All they managed to prove was how invisible black culture is to them and how unaware they are of their own ignorance.  

And the last point I can remember right now is how Chris' girlfriend acted. At first she played oblivious to her family's racism, an important point in and of itself. But the biggest slap in the face is when she spoke to Chris' friend on the phone: blank and emotionless face, feigning worry in her voice very convincingly. This can be seen as her doing the bare minimum to hide her racism, a vile person behind a facade of social awareness (this is the same character who *just* accused a cop of racial profiling, and here we realize she was simply trying to prevent his disappearance from being noted—""saved"" from the hands of one racist by another racist). This scene was straight up ""Don't trust white people. No matter what they say or do, you can never know what they're really thinking."" And we were shown a black man seeing right through her lies. 

IMO the film came down to this: we may believe racism is limited to seeing black people as inferior, yet it is not just our viewpoints that matter but our actions. Whether white people feel that black people are superior or inferior or equal, they continue to take their lives from them. Parallels are drawn between enslavement of black lives in the past and the appropriation of their culture in our present. The film attempts to affirm that appropriation is, in fact, modern racism. Really an excellent movie, and as with most films, no analysis can do it as much justice as re-watching the film and letting it provoke thoughts like these. I'm sure there's a lot more to catch (like, does anyone else feel that camera flashes specifically bringing people out of the sunken place was intentional?? or that when the cop car pulled up at the end, if it was the white cop driving then Chris would be screwed, because he'd be blind to issues of systemic racism/appropriation? or that the unexpected happy ending is a call for black people to support one another?). 


",5vv1qh
de94me6,I viewed it as a take on modern racism and the reckless appropriation of culture. All these rich white people are abducting and controlling black people because they are selfish and would like to be different would like to be black people.

How come when Grandma is pouring the iced tea and goes a little weird, the Mom tells her to go lie down and rest, like she is still an old person(clearly there for foreshadowing reasons). Wasn't one of the examples for doing it the first place was to have new strong bodies? 

Why don't Grandma and Grandpa live together or even talk to each other? I get Grandpa wanting to be an outside working man but why is Grandma a house maid?

For all the ""slaves"", can't they act just a little bit more 'in character'(aka not like exactly like an old white person). I mean they should know pretty well by now how to act around outsiders(especially black outsiders), and if not, then maybe watch some movies with some token stereotypes and pick up some mannerisms? I mean really, I get that we wouldn't have much of a movie if this was the case but in hindsight it is pretty funny to think that the family is trying their best to go through this big elaborate ruse and the old people are just BLOWING IT so hard.",5vv1qh
dha3lkd,"I'm guessing you're white because you find the odd interactions boring and I'm thinking it's because you can't relate to them. I'm not black but I am a minority and I find the family's reaction to Chris brilliant because it's absolutely something many well-meaning white liberals do but comes off as awkward and racist. It strikes home a lot more for me because this is the type of racism I'd run into on a daily basis - not the White Supremacist alt-right nuthead. This is the first movie I've seen that addresses this as opposed to the more obvious stereotype of racism that writers like to portray.

And stop comparing it to Tucker and Dale vs. Evil - it's a fun movie but it's an over the top comedy parodying horror tropes and Get Out is a satirical horror film on race relations in the US and not a comedy. I wouldn't even consider T&D even close to as smartly written as Get Out. ",5vv1qh

This is how the original Georgina is able to push through a bit, because she's still in there, however barely.

And again, someone had to buy Chris for the sake of the story, that's just a plot point and so it was Root, although I see your point that it wasn't vital that Root be the one to explain stuff.

As for rod, I also see your point. But he does tell Chris that Andre is the guy he saw and that they used to know him/that he went missing which is what helps Chris put the dots together as he articulates with an ""a ha!"" moment after hearing that, so Rod helps the story in that respect.

However, that presumption of equality never supersedes their fetishizaton of those black bodies, or their willingness to literally dehumanize them, turning them into fancy suits.

When the white people are saying weird remarks, the gist is ""you are different from me"". It's othering. There's also presumptions of inferiority/superiority in the mix, coming from the entire history of racism. The extreme form of this is ""you're a dumb or silly animal"", but it's usually more covert or subtle. Think of being a circus exhibit.  (And indeed the actual meaning in this movie is: we are gonna enslave your body and take out your brain)

If a black person assumes fist bumpability from another black person, that is assuming ""you are similar to me"".  This is a form of empathy and inclusiveness and welcoming.  It's the opposite of insulting.  There's no circus element.  It's like inviting someone in to your home and giving them what you yourself would like.  It's basic hospitality.  It's friendship.

So this happens often, but there are times in which it leaves you feeling uncomfortable because it's not ignorance, it's deliberate. 

Racism isn't always using a racial slur. Sometimes it's deliberately making someone feel like they don't belong and sometimes it's done through comments like this. And when you've experienced it often enough, you know when it's ignorance and when it's more sinister. 

Like in the film, you can tell there are times when he's trying to explain it to his girlfriend and she's looking at him like he's overreacting or like she really doesn't get it, so he just gives up. (And the messed up thing about it all is that in the end, you realise that she knew exactly what he was saying all along.) And that's the thing. You just get so tired of trying to explain your racist experiences and then someone goes, ""But I get that too"" completely disregarding context when human communication is about more than verbal communication. And that's the hardest part to convey when you're sharing an experience. So it always comes across as you being hypersensitive.

Back to the film again; I feel that that is what makes this film so damn good.

Yes, he violently lashes out. The imagery of how ""savage"" he became during the murders were very intentional (blood, ripped clothing, focused).

But the silent, White violence is more to fear than anything else. 

I think exposing it for what it is comes out violent -- but to who?

Chris in a way represents Black slaves who would rebel against their masters and run away. The gardener symbolizes slaves (and indigenous people too honestly) who would rather die than keep living enslaved. Andre the slave who sits up and looks happy. All three chose their fates for reasons of survival. And yet, they're savagery is being controlled/define and not of the family?

If the cop had successfully recorded Chris's ID, there would be a record of Chris being on that road at that time.

What the audience didn't know at that point was that Rose knew she was planning to essentially kidnap Chris, and there might have been questions and even a missing persons report filed for him. Rod knew they were going to Rose's parents' house, and the police report of hitting the deer would corroborate that information and lead the police to the Armitages.

This isnt true. People dont just hate white people. People hate white people who just say #alllivesmatters to serious issues of police brutality against poor people and people of color. People hate white people who turn a blind eye to the fact if your black you get higher prison sentence for the same crime as a white man.

Nah man this isnt true. Otherwise all olympic athletes would be black. If you can point to any scientific source of black people being stronger on average I'll look into it. Otherwise its conjecture.

I mean maybe but its not like people are against white people there are plenty of white celebrities that are generally loved by everyone definitely more than black celebrities and other races.

First, yes, I agree that in present day people have shown an increasing tendency to categorize all white people as privileged, ignoring the fact that the concept of privilege is more nuanced. You pointed out some examples--a person can enjoy the benefits of white privilege but also struggle with negative ""privileges"" such as being born into socioeconomic status, etc.

So back to OP's question--what ""good"" stereotypes beside being privileged exist for white people? First, I don't actually think being privileged is one because it devalues the person's achievements. But second, I feel there's a lack of positive stereotypes for white people, and that's a very freeing thing. Not having to meet the prescriptions of such stereotypes affords a person greater autonomy to define themselves as an individual, rather than just what their stereotypes require of them. I did use the word ""privilege"" in my response, which was probably a bit confusing, but I didn't mean privilege itself as an answer to the question. Maybe it would've been better to say the ""luxury"" of not being defined or something. But hopefully that makes a bit more sense?",5vv1qh

dewfscv,"""Asian Americans assimilate better into white culture better than other minorities/accepted by whites"" May I ask you to expound on that? How do Asians assimilate better than blacks? 
Also, what privileges do you have that other minorities do not?
Colorism exists in Asian countries, for sure and there is a lot of history behind that, although now those stereotypes are being challenged (but then again this depends on the Asian country we are talking about--4.436 billion people is too much to generalize). 
In America, though, (considering it is a smaller sample size) do Asian Americans view black Americans as inferior or do they just view them as they view other Americans? Have they gone out of their way to stop black people and block them from opportunity? 

The article suggests a great way to divide minorities. 

 Also, on the topic of slavery it is notable that the majority of Asians emigrated late and post 1960's --this is a significant fact in why Asian Americans should not feel like we owe any race anything for prior struggles we were not directly involved in.

Lastly, Asians are not the model minority because not every Asian is successful in America (for every Indian/Chinese/Filipina- American top earner there is some disenfranchised Vietnamese, Cambodian, Chinese American in an ethnic enclave somewhere in Cali or Texas or Florida). ",5vv1qh

In other words, ""Well, he's just asking for my ID.......but, what if I legally say no, and he doesn't like that?""

Another way of putting it is:  while asking for ID may not be a constitutional violation and is not ruled as such (""Because people can just say no!""), it seems like an imposition and an imposition by police I think borders on abuse.",5vv1qh

He says that they preserve a lot of the nervous system due to it's intricate connections but that the blind guy gets control of the motor functions.

Especially for grandma and grandpa, who I think were among the first to go through it. That ties into the whole idea of Georgina's mannerisms looking like she was being controlled.

It's also possible that grandma was freaked out by Chris discovering her malfeasance and didn't know how to respond in the moment. She also is acting how she thinks a black person would act toward another black person, something she has no concept of and could be overthinking, getting anxious, etc.

From the beginning, she 'accidentally' brings her boyfriend on the same weekend as her parents party.  She is mostly oblivious to the oddities of her parents and the people they hired to help around the house though she would have had to have spent a lot of time there.  Her mom is a hypnotist, and the actors (who did a good job) that played her parent's workers appeared hypnotized which her boyfriend picked up on.  At the party, she walks up to her boyfriend who is having a conversation with a married couple that has racist undertones.  He walks away and she turns to them with a facial expression to where the audience can presume she is telling them off but it never actually shows her doing it.  This cutaway was the biggest tell of all because its a staple in movies that are supposed to have a big character plot twist.  The entire reason for the party was to auction off the person she brought there so it would be weird for her to have been to one of these annual parties without noticing the auction.  They even show the auction during the party scene and it was in plain view.  They couldn't have been auctioning off people she knew without her being aware of it.

When he finds the photos of her with all of the different boyfriends, one of which was the help, he knew she was in on it.  It would have made more sense for him to pretend he didn't know what was going on long enough to steal the keys and leave.  Even when he is almost out of the door, he asks her for the keys when he should have already known she wasn't going to give them to him.

I didn't know anything about the movie when I first saw it.  The trailer made it seem like it would be a suspense movie with a big mystery similar to ""The Sixth Sense.""  There were no twists and there was no suspense.  Everything was exactly as it seemed from start to finish.  Like OP said, I felt like I knew the entire movie after the first few scenes.  I kept second guessing myself because I thought there is no way everything is this predictable.  Surely they are leading me to think one thing and surprise me with something else.

Personally I didn't feel that the white people in the movie were meant to represent all white people everywhere. It was more about a certain *type* of white person: the type that thinks black people are ""cool"", but still tends to treat actual black people as stereotypes rather than three-dimensional figures. Since this is a horror movie, that attitude gets exaggerated to extreme and absurd levels; ""thinks black people are 'cool'"" becomes ""wants to physically turn into a black person"", and ""doesn't recognize black people as fully three-dimensional"" becomes ""doesn't feel bad about lobotomizing them and stealing their bodies"".

Of course, other people may have a broader interpretation, and think that the white people in the movie *are* meant to represent all white people everywhere. I doubt that's what the director intended (after all, he's married to a white woman), but it might end up reinforcing disfavorable attitudes towards whites in some viewers' minds. So maybe I understand where you're coming from? I'm not sure.

> I love this hypocrisy, imagine a movie where the whole message was criticizing a certain group of people because the people who made the film had racist anxiety towards blacks? Oh, wait we do, it's called Birth of a Nation

I don't think it's that easy to make a direct comparison here. This movie is taking a kernel of anxiety and inflating it until it becomes something absurd and monstrous, and therefore entertaining to watch. The question is: How big was the kernel before the movie started inflating it? How much of the anxiety is real, and how much is exaggeration for the sake of fun? It's hard to tell, which is what makes it hard to compare with *Birth of a Nation*, where the anxiety is all sincere.

> despite how disgusting that movie is its still 10 times the film this one is because it really was a masterpiece that revolutionized cinema.

Not arguing with this. I don't think anyone claimed *Get Out* revolutionized cinema.

> if your movie hinges on one single factor for it to garner any interest or praise than it's not much of a movie

I don't think it's a single-factor movie. Leaving aside the racial themes, I was impressed by how tightly the movie was constructed. It didn't feel like it had any extra pieces. Practically everything had some significance to the plot, even if you didn't realize it until later. I also thought the acting was good, and the cinematography was interesting and effective.",5vv1qh

I truly cannot tell you the number of times I've been told some iteration of 

-You know, Koreans were basically enslaved by the Japanese, but they worked really hard to become the powerhouse they are today. I wonder why that is?

-You know, Asians don't complain about racism all the time and they're very successful in the US, have a good reputation and all that. I wonder why that is?

-You know, Chinese people faced oppression and racism too, but somehow they're stereotyped as hard working geniuses. I wonder why that is?

-Hey, I'm WHITE. I'm WHITE and I'm TOTALLY fine with admitting that maybe Asians are just naturally smarter than us WHITES. [Insert heavy, meaningful, pointed silence aimed at me, a naturally unintelligent negro here]

I doubt Asians are truly comfortable with these comments, but when it seems like you're trapped in a racial hierarchy, what do you do? Do you show solidarity, stand in the mud with us, and say they're wrong? Or, when you're so very close to being the so-called ""honorary Aryan,"" do you just accept what they're saying at the top? When whites are defending how you don't benefit from Affirmative Action because they're mad a black person got into a bunch of good schools, do you get angry at them for using you as a prop or are you happy they're saying good things about you?

dhi0mr8,"I believe this movie is objectively overrated by critics because the percentage of critics liking it is disproportionate to how worthy it is of acclaim. I fully understand Rotten Tomatoes is a percentage of critics, and not a 99/100 rating. 

At its core, this is a movie that follows many horror movie cliches. Protagonist heads to spooky location. Spookiness established by people inexplicably acting strangely. People tell protagonist to run/escape. The evil is revealed and dominates protagonist. Protagonist then goes on offensive by using violence against villains. For all the critics saying that this movie subverted horror tropes, I really don't understand how that's true. It added layers of humor and superficial social commentary to a horror movie. It had an interesting, Black Mirror-ish revelation about the source of the spookiness. But it didn't subvert horror tropes. 

There is an over-the-top, wacky comic relief character. ""I'm T S motherfuckin' A!"" That's the type of stupid silly line that as an audience we enjoy, but critics usually lampoon, and that was the essence of that entire ""character.""

It has a feel-good ending where the protagonist wins. Critics don't normally tend to appreciate clean, tidy ""let's all go home"" conclusions like that. 

It relies on supernatural phenomena/pseudoscience in order to work. Anytime you have a movie that switches at some point from being grounded in the real world, to the audience being forced to suspend disbelief because what's occurring onscreen is patently impossible, you're going to have critics frustrated and disliking the movie. 

I still think it is a good movie. However, it doesn't seem to make sense why only a single critic out of over 250 thought this was a movie worse than 2.5/4 stars. This is really not the type of movie that normally gets every single critic to like it. It has a greater percentage of critics liking it than Spirited Away or Casablanca!

That's not how it works buddy. Not even close. He didn't care what color the guy was, he just wanted to see and be able to take photographs. 

In the movie, it's clearly stated that black males where abducted because of their physical capabilities. That doesn't point to racism in itself except from what you have mustered up from your own personal belief. It seems like you don't even understand the definition of racism. Because from what you just said, if they hijacked only white people it would still be racist. 

How is choosing a race for it's ""qualities"" according to the white folks that examined Chris racist? If anything, the movie shows that people sometimes aren't racist at all but do things that appear racist or hurt another race without caring. If anything that shows that people are careless about others instead of racist. Their goal wasn't to kidnap black people because they hated black skin. The movie itself is about racism, no shit, but a HUGE point of the movie was that nobody did anything racist, it was just inherent (as is in society sometimes) that black people got the short end of the stick EVEN for their good qulaities (physical strength and whatever else the father says).",5vv1qh

Hypothetically if I wanted a body, I would pick an athlete for their tip top health. And as an old person, I would take a basketball player over any other kind of athlete.

Even when race is brought up, such as the old guy liking Obama and the people at the fake party asking what it's like to be black, it was a distraction, I think to keep him uncomfortable about racism rather than body snatching.

Also the protagonist was IMO chosen because the art dealer was jealous of his photography skills and basically wanted to steal his eye. 

I don't think there was anything in this film which could not be easily explained by race, IMO the point was actually that people read racism into things when it may not be there

The conversations seemed to imply that they find black people to be physically superior while white people are intellectually superior (which is why Jeremy thinks that a fusion of him and Chris would be an unstoppable MMA machine - they can make up for each other's deficiencies).

They see no problem in treating human beings of a specific race as commodities for their own means without any regards to their desires, their families and their lives. It's not racist, it just so happens that black men are stronger, faster, cooler and better in bed! Nothing racially-motivated about that, it's just a coincidence!

diaa847,"I never said it was a bad movie, you're missing the entire point of my argument which actually proves it. All I said was that this movie is not deserving of the ridiculous amount of praise it is receiving. A 99% on RT come on, are you honestly going to tell me you think this was a perfect movie?  It received this review for the wrong reasons (BLM, race-baiting). 



The fact that you wanna insinuate that I'm racist (which is hilarious because  you don't even know my race) proves my entire point. Imagine if a critic were to give this movie a thumbs down, he would most likely receive the same treatment I have received in this thread.

Also, grandpa really wouldn't have told him that he spent a lot of time under hypnosis.  

Andre had a tattoo by his right ear.

There's a clear racial motivation for the kidnappings and brainwashings. Moreover, the fact that it's a movie means that nothing is random. It's a movie about racial tension, and uses horror and comedy tropes to great effect in order to tell that story.

dekwrqm,"I mean, it would be an incredibly subtle reference, yes. But it's more than just both scenes being in a donut shop: it's almost the same shot of Buck and Rose, first of all. In Boogie Nights, Buck goes out to do a totally normal, and romantic, thing (get donuts for his pregnant wife) just like how Chris is going to meet his girlfriend's parents. Totally normal. However, something unexpectedly violent occurs, and they both end up the last man standing. Buck isn't the focus of the violence in Boogie Nights like Chris is, but I think it's still enough to justify light foreshadowing, especially since it's only the second scene of Get Out. 

I remember thinking in the theatre that it was an oddly specific and lingering shot of Rose in the donut shop. Why not just have her show up with pastries and coffee? Why show her picking them out as her introduction? (Besides linking it to the shopping/froot loops later, idk). ",5vv1qh

dej2eur,"This was the best reply I've gotten. I can respect all your points and it should be takin into account that I don't typically go for horror or suspense so maybe this style of story telling just didn't resonate with me.

On your first paragraph I would argue that yes the white people seem to just be in this community but that's also the only characters we are introduced to. It's hard to be like ""no they aren't sayin this"" when every person shown on screen actually did represent that. That's where I kind of talk about the unbalance of good and evil. The community maybe focused on the grand scheme but there also wasn't one white person trying to show an ounce of respect for black people (as individuals excluding the genetic fascination they had)  including the cop who wasn't part of the community.

2nd paragraph: I did like the comedic relief of Chris's good friend but it has to be takin into account that it wasn't ""Chris this family I'm telling you!"" Or ""Chris this community, I'm telling you!"" It was ""Chris, these white people, im telling you."" 

3rd paragraph: you are absolutely right that I shouldn't assume that this movie was intended to bring us closer. But I did hear many reviews talking about how important it was and how it would help us talk about race as a topic. So I went in hoping it would stand for the same fight I have been standing for all my life, to stop looking st people as color and to focus on their individual. When I walked out of the theater, It just felt like it was a step back.",5vv1qh
dej3p3q,I have to point out that it would be one thing if I watched a movie with all black or mixed cast with no white people and I decided to feel some kind of way about it. That would be assanine. I'm not saying the movie hit me weird because I didn't see a white person I could identify with. I'm saying the movie hit me weird because of how far they went to drive home the stereotypes and how clearly they focused on creating good and evil based on race. I point out that there wasn't one good white person but what I'm actually implying is that I didn't see one white person offer an ounce of respect towards any black person or one white person who treated a black person humainly or not as property. It was a community we assume everyone knows doesn't translate to real life. But do we know everyone actually disassociated entertainment with real things in their life.,5vv1qh

Then the free market exists on top of that...if you want more than food/shelter, you get a job and and income that is taxed as it is now (or if you spend it all on drugs, there is no other safety net and Darwinism x's you out I suppose).  One of the key benefits in my mind is that this SHOULD empower people to be able to better negotiate with their employers, i.e. you're less worried about taking a stand if you're not worried about putting food on the table / having a shelter over your head.    Hope that makes sense, it's an extensive topic.

By the time they got Chris, it seemed like a well oiled machine of a family working casually towards the end goal, with none of them seeming nervous or doubtful or anything towards the plan.

I think this also ties into the MMA/judo/jujitsu conversation about defense, and how Chris was later able to kill multiple people in a short amount of time because it was necessary, but not killing his girlfriend outside when she was cold and dying in the road like his Mother was.  I think not killing her was almost more powerful because he had just told her this story a few hours before, so it had to be on her mind while she was out there, and seeing him purposely choose to leave her was an extra ""fuck you"" while showing a finished character arc.",5vv1qh

I was a *huge* fan of Agatha Christie books as a kid (Ten Little Indians/And Then There Were None) was my absolute favorite - and is still in the top 5 probably.  Shit, it's probably responsible for every movie based on the premise that a certain number of people are brought to a location under a premise, and then are killed off one by one.  Maybe she wasn't the first, but she was certainly the master of the genre, and movies like Cube, Identity, Mindhunters, Devil, Final Destination, Saw, and even 2014's Sabotage (the Schwarzenegger one) all owe a nod to that novel and her works.

>People hate white people who just say #alllivesmatters to serious issues of police brutality against poor people and people of color.

How exactly are we supposed to take blacklivesmatter seriously when the biggest danger to black lives are OTHER black lives? 

>People hate white people who turn a blind eye to the fact if your black you get higher prison sentence for the same crime as a white man.

People say that the criminal system is biased against black people, but this doesn't seem to be the case. When controlled for criminal background, black felons actually have a 2% **lower** likelihood of going to prison compared to white felons, and the sentencing length of felony defendants is only 6% higher than whites. A study found a positive association with physical unattractiveness and juror penalty, which may have an effect unrelated to racial bias on the 6% higher sentencing length for blacks.

Also, while black men are sentenced to 10% more time in prison than a white man, I think a much better issue to talk about is why men get 60% more prison time, for the same crime, as women do.

>Nah man this isnt true. Otherwise all olympic athletes would be black. If you can point to any scientific source of black people being stronger on average I'll look into it. Otherwise its conjecture.

They have longer arms relative to their body and thicker skulls, making them much better for boxing. Their legs are also incredibly suited for sprinting. Their skin has a thick superficial horny layer which resists scratching and impedes the penetration of germs. They are more developed from the pelvis down (whites are more developed in the chest, though). Their jaws are bigger and stronger. The wrist and ankles are shorter and more robust. They also have better hand-eye coordination, which is why they are surprisingly good at difficult instruments like the violin (along with being more rhythmical than white people). 

While that does not constitute ""more muscular"" per se, I think ""muscular"" in this context is just a synonym for physical fitness and general sports-ability, for which the above examples would qualify, in my opinion. (although I'd admittedly be hard pressed to find a sport involving the jaw.)

>but its not like people are against white people

You're joking, right? Because black people on social media getting applauded for saying that only white people can be racist and that white genocide is a good thing, that surely doesn't mean people hate white people! If a magazine or a white YouTube personality said that about black people, they would be ruined. That is why it's trendy to be black. You are given so incredibly much leeway by society and social media. You are not responsible for your actions because everything bad you do can be blamed on the big boogeyman that is racism, i.e. white people

>there are plenty of white celebrities that are generally loved by everyone definitely more than black celebrities and other races.

It's not about the individuals. With that logic, you could say that America doesn't have racism because Obama was elected. It's about the group, not the individuals.

>I fucking hate this ""people hate white people"" shit, its not true,

I have had some other horrifying moments of bias over the years as well. :( 
  
Basically, asking where someone is from as normal conversation is one thing. It's mostly the inflection, I think, that does it. Like they expect you to be FROM somewhere (else). So if you are asking like you would ask a white person, it's probably OK - they could feel weird about it but... I don't know. I'm in a new city, so I typically ask people ""are you from here?/are you local, or are you transplant garbage?"". Maybe ""did you grow up here?"" etc.

If the other cultures want to forsake what we consider bad, then great, but they won't do so easily. And if we are supposed to accept what we consider bad then our society will suffer. A great example is the immigration boom in the 1870s to the early 1900s in the United States. Western Europeans began to immigrate and there were few issues. However, when eastern Europeans and jews and Slavs came over there were. There was ideological conflict and they were not as homogeneous with our white protestant majority as the western Europeans were. The eastern Europeans, Jews, and Slavs had to adapt to our culture. We also became more accepting over time of course of cultural differences but we never conceded our core principles. In some respects, it is a two-way street like you say, but it is the responsibility of the minority culture to adapt to the majority if the minority wants to get along with the majority.

The ""model minority"" stereotype is a prevalent one that works to undermine legitimate Asian American issues, I completely agree. My argument was that this ""model minority"" stereotype is why an Asian man was included in the cast of white oppressors, because Asian Americans aren't considered as big of a threat to white culture. One notable privilege I have is not having an inherent fear of being brutalized by police for a traffic violation, because of this ""model minority"" assumption. 

Colorism in Asian cultures isn't limited to their countries of origin. I've met many Asian Americans with unhealthy prejudices against other races, particularly African Americans. Whether or not this is a product of colorism/racism in Asian cultures or an adoption of the racist culture here in America, I'm not sure. Of course, this isn't an evidence that ALL Asian Americans are racist, that's not a claim I'm trying to make. I'm just saying that with privilege of any sort comes the capacity to be prejudice against those with less privilege.

It's not a myth, there are definitely myths about it like black people are bad swimmers because of extra muscle or bone in their legs or some shit. That stuff is objectively false. The truth is there hasn't really been extensive research into genetics based on race because race is so ill defined, broad, and volatile in many aspects. So when I say black people, I am specifically reffering to those that came from areas of the slave trade, where certain genetic aspects were sought after and became more prevalent as the population grew. It's also a pretty taboo subject. More research has been done on the socioeconomic factors for why blacks are represented so much more in sports (all of which is theory because it's all based on statistics which isn't really science).

But I now realize the real problem, and it's that people like to look at things like race, and racism, as a binary issue when in reality, like with all things, there are nuances that are not considered. I think it'd do a lot of good for people to understand racism isn't this all encompassing term, like why a lot of people belive that black people can't be racist, or why Asian people are rarely brought up in a topic about racism when they're probably some of the racist people in the world.

Like the writers for Hidden Figures literally adding fictional Kevin Costner scenes where he's anti-racist.

He realized early on that he was trained by the mom to respond to her hypnotism (he figured it out as soon as she ""cured"" his smoking habit) so he had to compensate for that. Also, the home is in a secluded location that he's unfamiliar with - the dad even mentioned that the closest neighbors are across a lake - and Rose has the keys to the car. He wouldn't get far on foot and he would need her cooperation to be able to drive out there. Plus, if they're after him and he gets away, she just has to call the police and say that her boyfriend stole her car.

Obviously he wasn't being careful when he straight up murdered everyone, but it was do or die at that point. 

responding to your edit: He was in love with her and gave her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he thought she was being mind-controlled too.

Maybe, hopefully, it will help people gain some perspective. I'll never know what it's like to be a black person, but seeing the movie through this character's perspective was eye-opening to me, noticing all the realistic racist microaggressions and his reaction to them: he clearly hates it and is made to feel uncomfortable, but tolerates their behavior anyway because he's probably SO used to it at this point, that he didn't notice for a little while that something was seriously amiss; that it was about to escalate.

Okay, this is the problem right here. Why is it only ""certain""white people that get called out for this bullshit. Imagine a movie that critiqued a certain group of black people of being uncultured thugs by showing a horror movie of a couple of black people torturing a mentally disabled white person because he supported Trump, would you just be like ""Oh, no, the movie isn't racist or pushing racist themes at all, it's making legitimate points towards how a certain group of Black Americans act in our society, and since it's a horror movie it's exaggerating it to such an extreme and entertaining point where it becomes ridiculous to watch. You also can't really tell where the satire begins and where it ends so let's ignore the obvious messages of the movie that EVERYONE who's watched it understands"" Hell maybe it isn't racist, but people on this subreddit wouldn't be as supportive towards that movie like they are with this one.

Would you ignore the subtleties and just focus mainly on the genre? Yeah, no you wouldn't. No one who's being fair would. Only an apologist would.

"" This movie is taking a kernel of anxiety and inflating it until it becomes something absurd and monstrous, and therefore entertaining to watch.""

For the sake of pushing a larger message that critiques a race of people for being a stereotype that the director and people like the director think is real. I love this b.s, let's criticize stereotypes by using stereotypes in our movie. Oh, and before you go, ""it's not ALLLLL WHITE PEOPLE"" the problem here is the idea that only white people are capable of this attitude, thus criticizing ""SOME WHITE PEOPLE"" instead of ""SOME PEOPLE"" of doing it.

""Not arguing with this. I don't think anyone claimed Get Out revolutionized cinema.""

Yeah, me neither, but it certainly doesn't only have the KKK message going for it which was the point I was pushing for. 

""I don't think it's a single-factor movie.""

Um, yeah. It is.

""Leaving aside the racial themes""

"" I was impressed by how tightly the movie was constructed. ""

Sure, you were. It was like if Alfred Hitchcock directed the movie himself.

Yay, it was ""tightly constructed"". I hate those loosely constructed horror movies you get where they just go all over the fucking place. Like, where's the first goddamn act? Is this it, is this where it ends? THANK GOD we finally got a movie that actually has structure.

They get their brain transplanted into the black person's body then go on with their lives. I think you might be confused because of the ""groundskeeper"" and ""maid""?

And the grandma was doing pretty stereotypical grandma stuff (cooking, caring for her family in general), though acting maid-like to fool Chris. 

The theme of ""enslavement of blacks"" still holds, because they literally enslave them in the form of taking control of their body while they become helpless passengers in their own bodies - like how Chris couldn't control his body, only watch from ""the sunken place."" The other people who'd already been ""taken over"" were presumably also stuck in ""the sunken place,"" unable to take back control of their body.

It used the Coagula technique as a metaphor for how black bodies are appreciated for their physicality and prowess, but not for the minds inside them.  That's a damn original metaphor for an pervasive idea.

The art dealer, literally blind and acting like one of the people who ""doesn't see color,"" may not have been as openly racist as the others in the cult, but he had no problem using the racism for his gain.  There was a brilliant moment that I caught the second time I saw the movie, when he was talking to Chris through the TV; he was trying to explain what would happen to Chris's consciousness and Chris sadly,  hopelessly replied ""The Sunken Place!""

""Yes, that's what she calls it!"" the art dealer cheered, with no CLUE how much pain Chris was in, because like many white people, he wasn't TRYING to understand Chris' POV, and since he hadn't been to The Sunken Place, he didn't really care.

to quote a guy above me

They weren't slaves. They were doing everything they wanted to do. There's hints about that before the big reveal.

-Dean tells Chris that ""mom was always in the kitchen, cleaning, making sure her house was immaculate. It's as if there's still a little piece of her here."" So basically the grandma was the type of person who enjoys cleaning and takes a lot of pride in the appearance of her home. That's a lot different from a servant/slave who is forced to cook and clean.

-The grandma wasn't actually doing housekeeping work at the party, Missy was. When Chris is taking photos he sees Missy come out of the kitchen and hand Georgina a tray of food and drinks, implying that Georgina didn't actually make the food, Missy did. That's not normal if you hired a cook/housekeeper.

-The Grandma's very last words, after she knew Chris killed several of her family members, were ""YOU RUINED MY HOUSE!"" She cared more about her house getting messed up that her grandson getting beat gen to death. That's how obsessed this lady was with housekeeping and cleanliness.

-The Grandpa was an Olympic athlete who enjoys doing work outdoors. When Chris comments on all the hard manual labor he's doing, the Grandpa genuinely smiles and says ""it's nothing I don't already want to be doing!"" He's doing all this physical work because he couldn't do it for years with his frail old body and now he's enjoying what it's like to be young again.

My point is you're probably more likely to relate to it if you're a minority that has ever been subjected to microaggressions (not a fan of the word because it implies aggression when it's normally just well-meaning cluelessness and awkwardness). It's all the more fascinating because all of these odd interactions are related to the plot's twist and takes on a whole new meaning when you look back at it.

I don't think there is much merit whatsoever in comparing it to Tucker and Dale.  One is a goofy movie that uses horror tropes for comedic effect, the other is a thriller (or horror, whatever, but I think thriller is more apt) that has a funny character in it.

The audience expects something dark and unjust, which would be the perfect darkly ironic ending (and a little too real), but our expectations are pleasantly subverted by a likable character that cared enough about his friend when no one else would to go and see what was up (even when he repeatedly told Chris to not go in that house, he was going to do it, for his friend). I don't think the moment would have packed nearly as much of a punch or response if we hadn't seen Rod's character built into a funny, likable, loyal friend.

I'm white, so I've never experienced that personally, but I've definitely seen situations where white people have acted so...I guess protective....Of colored people. There was once a situation on my college campus which involved two white students saying ""nigga"" on a video of Snapchat. What happened as a response? A large group of about 50 people made a big deal about it. And guess what? About 48 of them were white. I'm not saying that kind of behavior is okay, but that this saw a situation of white people getting offended FOR the black students, many of the black students on campus said they didn't care and weren't offended. But there were those ""try so hard to not sound racist"" white people that had to take a stand.

A lot of the reasoning you're taking as truth is in fact the same old rationalizing white people do to excuse their racism. The micro aggression montage is how they were interviewing Chris to try and find out if they should bid on him or not.

This movie is strongly about how white people, specifically white liberals, deal with their racism by the positive objectification of black people and black culture. But it's still objectification, and it's still entirely rooted in racism. It's primarily the opposite of seeing racism where none is there.

Groundskeeper blew his head off, the head will be in pieces, they're probably not going to find his surgical scars. They'll find grandma's surgical scars. So? People have surgery, it doesn't automatically mean it's a crime.

I'm new to reddit and hope it's not uncool that I'm linking to my own answer elsewhere as part of the answer to this question. If so, apologies--I have done a little FAQ checking and I didn't see anywhere that says doing so is against the rules.
",5vv1qh
despd1c,"The house was on fire and no dudes were trying to put it out. ""There was a note with a confession on it!"" Yes, and that note was paper, which got all burned up in the fire. It's pretty reasonable to assume it was all going to burn down, so it's reasonable to assume the authorities won't find the video tapes and photographs that give them more information, dude. How does a special Black-people-conditioning TV look different from a non-special one after they've both been burned up in a fire and maybe had the rest of the house fall in on top of them?

The surgical gowns and gloves and masks, the X-rays, that will burn up.

Will the police find enough to determine the room that dad and Stephen Root (surgery patient/art dealer) died in was an operating room? Why? I mean, maybe the OR beds and the surgical equipment, scalpels, etc., will obviously be 2 OR beds and scalpels, etc. after the fire -- maybe they won't melt into something unrecognizable even when the oxygen blows up (it's an OR) (and maybe the anesthetic is also volatile and explosive) and won't be pulverized after the rest of the burning house collapses, and maybe the police will be able to conclude it was an OR and that Stephen Root was getting brain surgery. Maybe. Or maybe they'll think the homicidal Black man groundskeeper who killed one person with a stuffed deer's antlers* and another with a rifle among other things, might have just knocked the guy's head open with an axe or something.

That's if it doesn't happen that the burning, likely explosion from the oxygen supply and perhaps the anaesthesia supply, don't blow enough of him to bits, along with any pulverizing, so that they don't find him in pieces and just assume he came apart in pieces during the fire. And the rest of the big, old, heavy house collapsing on top of the basement.

Grandpa track star blew his head off, so they won't find surgical scars on his skull.

Maybe they'll conclude Georgina had cranial surgery. So what? People have cranial surgery. If they found a bunch of murdered dead bodies and one had a prosthetic arm, the police wouldn't suddenly conclude the missing arm was evidence of something nefarious connected to all the other deaths.

*Deer antlers: so he died from puncture wounds to his soft tissue. Maybe in the fire all that will burn up anyway and they'll find a charred skeleton and assume that he simply died in the fire, burned and/or smoke inhalation. Everyone in the house may be identifiable human remains with discernible cause of death or there may just be bits of human being among other smoking rubble that the authorities can determine were human, but there will not be a bunch of obvious evidence of what was going on.

Outside, they'll find grandma, grandpa--who is Black man employed as groundskeeper, if they find records of him, or maybe just young Black man--and girlfriend, a wrecked car, a rifle used to kill Rose and for Black groundskeeper to kill himself. 

Why would the authorities assume Chris--whose last name the local police don't have, because in the end he didn't give ID when they were stopped after the car crash, and because the big city detectives thought it was all a big joke so they probably didn't file a missing persons report, and because he was cut off during the 911 call and so didn't say anything more than the first name Chris if they even got that much--was the cause of all this death?

Additionally, as much as the bad-assery of TSA Rod is treated as a joke, Rod did tell Chris to assume that the situation should be considered handled, and Rod did know something was wrong. Maybe Rod will also do something further to help cover any of Chris's tracks. 

So even if the police wanted to find Chris, what do they have to go on beyond, ""yes, we're looking for a young Black man, mid to late 20s, named Chris, who was visiting from the big city""? EDIT: Actually, why would they even know Chris was Black from the call? Isn't it more likely that the police will see: big house burned up in fire, killing three members of the family and one of their friends, a blind guy, inside. The police won't think it's just an accident, because outside, they will find crashed car, grandma who once had cranial surgery dead from crash, daughter dead from gunshot, groundskeeper dead from self-inflicted rifle shot with the gun he used to kill daughter. When the authorities are looking for a Black man to blame it all on, they've got the groundskeeper right there.

EDIT: I don't think the surviving coagula order people are going to come around supplying helpful information that will lead to evidence of their guilt in multiple crimes, so I doubt they'll be helping the police.

OR maybe 911 is able to trace the very short 911 call from Chris's phone (I think it was his phone, but I can't remember) and they'll know exactly who he is, conclude that he was there, and come asking questions, and TSA Rod will help him handle it. ""Yes, I was there at the Armitages, I called 911 to report the fire. Why didn't I wait for the police? Oh, because my lawyer, sitting here next to me, has just told me I shouldn't answer that question, detective."" I still think they're going to conclude grandpa groundskeeper was the murderer.

Maybe to me the happy ending was the opposite of a typical horror movie happy ending (when they have one) where the heroes escape but the last shot shows the monster is still alive. In Get Out, it makes sense that he'll be arrested and that's kind of been foreshadowed--then, in the very last moments of the movie, there's a surprise happy ending. Especially happy I think because he'd seemed so emotionally dependent on Rose, having no parents and saying she was ""all he had""--but his best friend comes through for him.

Similar arguments were made about black quarterbacks in football (mainly saying that black people aren't smart enough to play the position).

When Jeremy asks Chris to stand-up at the dinner table, I'm pretty sure he planned on putting him in a choke-hold to speed up the process (like he did with Andre), but the parents wanted to make sure Chris was ""evaluated"" the next day.

My take is, Rose was on the phone with Andre and her family was listening, just like in the later scene when she called Roy.  When she sensed that Andre was getting suspicious she sent Jeremy out to keep an eye on him.  When Andre decided to make a break for it Jeremy had to prevent him from leaving.

Some of my favorite horror films include:

The Sixth Sense (which I saw months after it came out, knowing the twist. A script is really good if you can enjoy it knowing the plot twist).

The Others (I watched it again the day after I saw it on video the first time, another where it makes SO much sense if you know the plot twist.).

Silence of the Lambs (you don't think it's a horror movie?  Oh, honey!  It's a slasher film with less gore and a better plot.).

Cabin in the Woods (a bit too proud of its own cleverness, but an excellent homage and parody.)

Se7en.  (So bleak, so well-crafted.  David Fincher could've dialed down Brad Pitt a bit at the end, but that one left a knot in my stomach, in a good way.)

Rosemary's Baby and the Stepford Wives (the originals, though I liked the books better, especially Rosemary's Baby)

Misery (2nd favorite Stephen King novel, favorite movie adaptation of his books. For someone whose bread and butter is supernatural horror, King really knows how to make humans his scariest monsters)

Night of the Living Dead (which Jordan Peele said influenced him, same with Stepford Wives.  The low budget shows too much, the script goes OTT, but Duane Jones and the creepiness and the fact that the human in-fighting is almost as scary as the  zombies saves it.)",5vv1qh

dkxi3sq,"I know this is late. 

But I explained this to my gf who recently moved to NYC and isn't white. I believe there are 2 types of ignorance, willful ignorance and innocent ignorance.

Willful ignorance is the outright racism. Refuse to believe that you can offend people. Other things like supremacy and segregation. The things most people think about when you call somebody a racist. 

And then there is innocent ignorance which can happen with 'liberals' or generally people that wouldn't be considered racist. The innocent ignorance is when people assume things because they heard it or they don't know any better, without having a deeper intent to injure or insult the person. 

For example, asking a black person if they celebrate Kwanzaa can be either one. It can be willful ignorance if you know that they are Christian and you want to be an asshole or it can be innocent ignorance if you have no idea what their religious beliefs are and don't want to make them feel excluded. 

A real life example of innocent ignorance that I've experienced is when people assume you are Mexican because you speak Spanish. I have red hair and they would say something such as ""i didn't know Mexicans could have red hair or you sure you aren't Irish?"" I can choose to be insulted, but if you can tell the person isn't being a douche and suggesting anything, it would be wiser to just tell that person that they should watch a telenovela or something and see that there are many different types of people in Mexico and even more for the rest of Latin America. 

A dangerous part of innocent ignorance is the failure to correct it. If somebody says something to you and it is offensive (and would offend people in the future) you should let them know. You could choose to be polite or aggessive about it depending on the situation, but until they understand that it's offensive they will continue the same behavior and without knowing any better. 

TL;DR Not all ignorance is racist. there can be bad ignorance and well-intended ignorance",5vv1qh

dhgbiwa,"According the to blind guy, the races didn't actually matter. They didn't specifically auction black people, black people just had the few traits they cared about. Of course, it might be true that the family specifically targeted black people, but that would be seem to be from more than habit than anything. The grandfather lost to a black person in sprinting, which makes sense because the structure of black people's legs are more suited for sprinting than the legs of whites. So he chose a black person's body. The movie also comments on the stereotype of police being unwilling to help black people when they go missing, so that stereotype could also be a factor for the initial choosing. It is not unreasonable to assume that a habit was established, especially when you consider the daugther, Rose. It's quite clear that the family has done the awkward-racist-old-white-people routine quite a few times. 

The movie plays off our hyper-sensitivity to racism so incredibly much, and it does so in every single instance except the cop guy in the beginning.

Everything about the way the family acted was deliberate (except perhaps the son). Their awkwardness and ""accidental racism,"" as well as Rose's outraged responses to it, were all lies. There's no way they had been doing it a dozen times WITHOUT the family being aware of how they acted, especially considering Rose is completely aware of it. She would've told them.

The guests as well. Every piece of ""racism"" at the party was to vet the protagonist to see if he had the traits they wanted. Guy asks if he plays golf and uses fake ""well-meaning racism"" to try and check out his form. Woman literally checks out his muscles and, once again, uses the stereotype of ""clueless white people"" to inquire to his dick size. Guy talks about how fairer skin used to be preferred, but now ""black is in fashion,"" hinting towards the social and societal advantages given to black people. (For example, Obama was literally given a Noble Prize for being black.)

All of that is assumed to be because of racism, but the movie reveals that not to be the case. Making us aware of our hypersensitivity about race and showing that a lot of things we perceive as being racist aren't actually racist, is a theme throughout the movie. For example, the scene with Rod and the cops comment on the stereotype about the police not caring when black people disappear. Yes, they didn't care, but that's because Rod had an incredibly outlandish claim which he did a shitty fucking job of explaining. It makes complete sense for the police not to take him seriously. Not because of racism and not caring about black people, but because Rod's an idiot. Likable, yes, but an idiot regardless.",5vv1qh
dhhppuo,"First of all, someone doesn't know if they missed the point of a movie or a piece of fiction, at least not on their own, so how would they know ""not to bother""? People generally assume their interpretations are correct.

Secondly, I don't think you know what ""white guilt"" means. White guilt is when a white person feels like they are inherently racist or responsible for the inherent racism of other white people, and alter their behavior to compensate. It's an awful thing, really.

Also, just what racist drivel have I spewed?

And I'm certainly not denying that racism exist. I am arguing about the message of the movie, which is a purposefully created piece of fiction. I am also arguing the definition of racism, which many people seem to misunderstand these days, but that's not the same as arguing that racism doesn't exist.

Rose's parents are (apparently) liberals who proudly voted for Obama, which is likely true. I think that point was intentional, because racism doesn't only manifest through people shouting racial slurs and burning crosses.

And no, they may not have consciously made a point of not associating with black people, but they don't, and I don't think that's a coincidence. They're ""well-meaning"" and ""friendly"", but yet they're still studying Chris under the baseless assumption that he carries certain traits. They still seemingly associate Jesse Owens' athletic ability with his race, which started this whole thing to begin with. Their perception of him as a person comes from stereotypical, racist belief patterns and they haven't sought to change anything by associating with actual black people that aren't body-jacked. They've traveled all over the world and had the ""privilege"" of experiencing other cultures but have no idea how to speak to or relate to people who aren't like them.

I also think back to the scene where Jeremy assumes that Chris is athletic. He then tries to needle Chris about MMA, with the sly dig that MMA is more a test of mental skill and strategy, rather than pure athleticism. I wonder which one he thinks he's more likely to excel at vs. his brother's boyfriend. 

It's a complicated issue that's difficult and uncomfortable to untangle, which is why a lot of people stop at, ""Well, I'm not calling random black people n-words, I voted for Obama, there's no way I could ever be racist"".

The Shining

Silence of the Lambs

Get Out

The only movie I would consider watching again out of all of those is Get Out because I actually enjoyed it. I respect the hell out of The Shining and the Silence movies for how well they do what they do and how good Hopkins is, but I have zero interest in seeing them again.

I have a lot of trouble sleeping. I also get scared very easily so stuff that freaks me out leads to me having even more trouble sleeping. I'm very squeamish so I can't stand gore (covered my eyes for just about every trap in Saw 2). A good example of this is that I like watching MMA and BJJ but if someone is in a submission that targets a joint I will cover my eyes to try to avoid seeing a bone break/dislocate because that generally leads to me almost puking. I also get very severe migraines which can be triggered by stress among other things.

Black people are 13% of the US population, yet are responsible for 52.5% of all murders in the whole country. Does that statistic (which is  FACT, btw) validate fear that you will be murdered, most likely by a black person??? No, it shouldn't! But statistically it should (because facts) ,especially if you are also a black man, who is over 90% of the receiving end of said murder! Yet all of your problems are at the hands of a white man. How does ANY intelligent person see the double standard that is constantly applied as a way of changing *anything* for the better. You CANNOT blast one subset of people and expect a real change. Black people have always known this, right? They have always felt ""please don't judge me"". Which is right and just! They should not be judged! Yet, when roles are reversed all logic goes out the window. The **REALITY** of the situation is that 90% of white people are on their side, with a 10% side of batshit crazy nazis who are not. PoC are asking not to be judged, while judging others. If you don't see a problem with that, your eyes aren't open, or you're just an asshole with a whole lot of invalid guilt. This whole getting along things takes **A LOT** of work. ON ALL SIDES. And some people really aren't holding their end of the bargain.

A guy ignoring possible brainwash sex slavery for some tail and inadvertently driving up to save his friend in a tough situation is one of those scenarios that seemed possible at the time but thinking about it more it becomes really obvious that it's a joke that doesn't fit the movie's comedic style.

That's not to say that blacks *can't* swim, but when we're talking about the Olympics, every advantage, and disadvantage, counts. Blacks dominate basketball for a similar reason.

The movie even specifically hinted at racism in the family that stems from his grandfather's history with Jesse Owens. If it wasn't murder of only one race, then why didn't they also do this to other races?

>Making us aware of our hypersensitivity about race and showing that a lot of things we perceive as being racist aren't actually racist, is a theme throughout the movie.

degk0sw,"Jeez, here I thought we were going to have an actual debate but your response is disheartening. I apologize for formatting and grammar as I'm writingall of this on my phone. 

First of all, you're only addressing one small point in the entire body of my post. Something which is probably the easiest to defend against simply because as I briefly mentioned before, statistics is a very flawed system to come up with any meaningful conclusion when you're trying to figure out cause. This is because of the alterity of information and unknown variables. You can only come up with educated guesses( not all the time.) A project I did for a digital humanities and data analytics class was trying to implement a system in society that would allow access to hundreds of bits of information about people living in and around city centers. This would improve our ability to come up with more educated responses. We came to the conclusion that with our current technological limitations  (data storage), it would be near impossible to pull off even if we ignore the fact that we'd have to severely invade your privacy turning more into an Orwellian society. The point I'm trying to make by telling you this is that things like studies into the reasons why more black people play certain sports and coming to the conclusion that it's things like cost and opportunity, are very flawed. All studies of this nature are. Now I'm not saying they're wrong, only that there is a very strong reason that it could be a different cause because our information is incomplete and holds all kinds of biases  (not saying it's possible to remove all bias, only that in statistics there are many inherent biases). 

To address your other points, white kids definitely have more options than black kids, but that does not explain the highly disproportionate amount of those participating in sports at the highest level. The fact that only something like ten percent of the population even has the aptitude to play professional sports, and 10 percent of that 10 percent even makes it, only further suggests that given our small sample size we really cannot use something like limited options as a reason because if that was the case, it'd be reflected in those sports. 

Your Jewish example is even weaker. You're not accounting for things like segregation and population density. It's a well documented fact that blacks did not participate in the same leagues as whites in all sports for quite some time. And even then the population of blacks was not as high as it is today which has given time to allow a greater range of blacks with higher athletic abilities. I just don't see how because ones options are limited, it somehow explains why certain ethnic groups participate at higher levels. It's not like there aren't poor white people, there are more white people on welfare then there are black which makes sense given population sizes. Why doesn't that reflect on participation rates? Is it because black people have nothing better to focus their time on other than sports given the same economic status of white people who don't end up becoming renowned athletes? Because that's pretty racist. 

If you'd like, I can go over a case by case basis offering explanations as to why certain sports have their population sizes. If anything, your last point only strengthens my argument. If the cost of entry is the reason why so many black people play certain sports, that would be reflected across the board wouldn't it? So what are you suggesting as the reason more white ethnic groups dominate soccer over blacks? My belief is that soccer is not a game that relys on strength, size, and speed as much as it does finesse and hand eye co-ordination. The sports where those three things count the most, blacks dominate in. Namely football, basketball, and boxing. The all time greats in all those sports were disproportionately black. UFC/MMA is slowly becoming that way too. Also soccer is just not popular in the U.S, neither is Rugby. 

Something like wrestling where the cost of entry is very low, and size, strength and speed account for a lot, you'd imagine you'd see a lot more black people as it satisfies the prerequisites for both our arguments. The reason you don't? It's just not a popular sport. It's a hard sport and the population is pretty accurate relative to the general population. 

I want to reiterate the fact that when I say black people I mean descendents of certain regions of Africa where the slave trade was booming. West Africans are more athletic than whites, Asians, and other Africans. Not all black people are from Africa, and not all Africans are from West Africa. I base my conclusions on research I've done, as well as simple observation and common sense. Are you denying that slaves were not picked for their physical aptitude and then were bread to keep those traits through generations? Or were East Africans not able to participate in the slave trade as much because they don't share the same economic status of West Africans?",5vv1qh

Sometimes a racist cop *is* just a racist cop. We have lots of real-world examples of it. Ask yourself why you even want this cop to turn out to be good. Like the quote from before, in a lot of racially focused movies, especially ones that are negative towards white people, there always has to be at least one white character on the right side, that people want to root for, sort of as a way of saying ""not all whites"", and making white people feel better. Basically all lives matter-ing the whole movie.

The antagonists could have been southern racists, KKK members, trump supporters, but instead Peele made a point to go after liberal, ""well-meaning"" whites and expose their underlying racism, and now you want a ""well-meaning"" white (and a cop on top of it!) to be one of the movies heroes? 

With the terrible relationship black people have with cops and the rise of anti-police brutality protests, what kind of message would Peele be sending to the black people watching by starting the movie with a scene that evokes memories of Trayvon Martin, then taking us through Chris' experience with Rose's family by subjecting him to the same micro-aggressions we (hi, Im black) experience every day, then having him have to fight to save himself, but then showing a white policeman attempting to save him but being killed which a) is asking us to feel sympathy for a white character (which goes against what this movie is about) and b) essentially makes the cop into a martyr of sorts. 

Do you see how problematic it is for this movie to make a martyr out of a white cop?

Maybe this is all coming from the fact that you think the cop didnt have a purpose, but I feel like he did. He furthered the ""well-meaning white"" narrative,  got us to trust Rose more, and theres a couple of other theories floating around about his and Rose's interaction.

But having him come back and try to save Chris would *not* have gotten all of the same points across, I promise you. I would have felt, ultimately, betrayed. Chris saved *himself*, and all the help he got came from other black characters. That is a *much* more powerful statement.

And he was dependent on her, he said she was all he had, so he didn't want to believe she would deceive him like this. As for the stolen car thing, I think that's the least likely outcome since he wouldn't try to steal Rose's car unless he thought she would prevent him from leaving, and if she was actively preventing him from leaving he couldn't count on pulling a fast one on her.

He could have called 911, but you saw what happened when Rod tried to share his theory - the reality was even more batshit than he thought (brain-swapping!!) and they thought he was insane. They laughed in his face. 

So we have this random dude calling the police to say that a local family (who probably have a great local reputation - they're wealthy, have thriving medical practices, etc) is secretly kidnapping black people to do freaky mind control shit to them. I guess if they located the ""hired help"" and realized they were actually missing people there would be a cause to investigate, but that assumes they believe that crazy story in the first place.

The cop Having undertones of racial bias
The only moment the father and Chris see eye to eye is discussing Obama.
The bingos reference to white people selling slaves.

If I'm truely the only person who recognized these things or felt this way then maybe it just is my own personal

Which black people generally have more of.

>but again, they very specifically targeted black people.

Yeah, but not because of the race itself, but because of the traits of the race. If the traits were more prominent in other races, they would've likely gone for those. That's the difference. But of course, there is the habit angle to consider, too.

>Everyone knew they were killing specifically black people, and it's murder no matter the situation.

There's a difference between ""let us only target black people as a principle"" and ""black people generally have the traits we're looking for to a greater degree than any other races. To maximize the chances of getting the best we can, we should take that into consideration.""

The first is racism, because even if you moved the traits to other races, they wouldn't change anything, because the important thing to them was not the traits, but the race as a social group. That is the distinction.

>The movie even specifically hinted at racism in the family that stems from his grandfather's history with Jesse Owens.

Black people have better legs for sprinting. This is a proven, scientific fact. The grandfather lost and thus envied that trait. He didn't care about him being black, he cared about him having legs that were better than his own.

>If it wasn't murder of only one race, then why didn't they also do this to other races?

Because the other races were less likely to have a couple of traits that they wanted, and the rest of the difference didn't matter to them.

>but then we realize that they're all okay with him getting killed to be used as a platform for someone else.

So? This is what I'm talking about. When did they ever give the impression that they'd have problems with what they were doing if he had not been black? They never did. You're making a baseless assumption that the only reason they are fine with taking his body is because he is black.

And all of those racist moments *were* misunderstandings. As in, misunderstandings by the audience. On purpose. The audience and the protagonist assumes that they are well-meaning, if clueless about racism.

A young man out of contact with one of his friends for 48 hours wouldn't necessarily raise much suspicion. A young man missing for longer, who inevitably is missed at work when he doesn't show? And his friend goes back to the cops and actually files a missing persons report? Of course the cops would speak to his girlfriend. 

As to the rest, below is my response to the person who made the same initial comment as yours.

Are you talking about the call at the end when Rod tried recording her? There was nothing of seduction in that call. She knew he was suspicious, she knew ""what he was doing."" When there was the possibility that Rod was recording from the start of the call she played the worried, loving girlfriend all freaked out about Chris. When Rod paused the call to start the recording she knew what he was doing. That's why when they started talking again she completely changed how she was speaking. Rod's reaction was exactly what she was aiming for in the second part of the conversation.

Furthermore this is a family that, based on Alison's trophy photos, have taken a large number of guys. There's no way in hell she would move onto the friend of a guy they just took. The police may not get suspicious of one guy going missing but two guys missing and the most obvious common link between them is Alison? That would bring possible police attention.

How is this a stereotype...? I'm sorry, what? Being white and having mental health problems and aggression is a stereotype now? I'm sorry if this comes off as condescending, it's really not meant to be but I'm just genuinely confused as to how you made that connection. Mental illness and aggression is *hardly* limited to young white males. There's been plenty of portrayals of aggressive and mentally unstable teenagers and young adults that aren't white males.

Entitlement...? She was defending her boyfriend from a racist cop. This is going to be universally agreed to be the only decent thing she did in the entire film (even if her motive was sinister). Where is the entitlement. Where did she assume everyone wanted to fuck her?

>The only moment the father and Chris see eye to eye is discussing Obama.

See ""eye to eye""...? Chris nodded politely and said he voted for Obama, too. You'd either vote for Obama or one other candidate...it was hardly a specific and unique thing to see ""eye to eye"" on. That entire scene, and by extension the entire trip up until the twist was basically Chris navigating through awkward interactions and this Obama thing isn't an exception. 

>The cop Having undertones of racial bias

The only thing in your entire paragraph that's actually a stereotype. 

However in your previous comment you said ""over the top"". It was hardly over the top with the cop. Over the top means exaggerated and larger than life. The interaction here wasn't exaggerated at all. He asked, in a polite manner, to see his identification. So yes, he's being racist but the scene had no elements of it that was over the top.


> But I want to be clear I'm not condemning this movie, I'm only giving my sole viewpoint.

I know you're not condemning the movie, you don't really have to repeat that. Since my first comment, it wasn't never the point of this exchange.

I think you're using the term stereotype way too liberally and you're grasping at *a lot* of straws and making connections that are just blatantly not there.

> white guy killed a family of Black people trying to take over him and had all sorts of racial pokes at black people. It just didn't resonate, but that's ok.

See, right here. Bam. You just basically proved me right. Racial pokes? There were no racial pokes at white people. There were pokes at racist *people* who happened to be white in this film. This just screams insecurity if you perceived it this way. The white people in this film acted like shitty people, and people have no problem rooting or cheering against them because they're shitty people, *not because they are fundamentally white*. You're getting offended by something that was never meant to offend anyone. Unless...you identify with being racist, kidnappers...? 

Nobody with a mature sense of the world is actually going to see the white people portrayed in this film as representative of all white people, and I sincerely doubt Jordan Peele sees white people like that. It's the same even if it was a white protagonist and a dangerous black family. The antagonists in this film clearly aren't meant to their entire race. You're seeing issues that aren't even there.

I know I'm late to the party, but I just recently saw this movie.  This entire movie is a refutation to your claim that there is no reason to ask for ID. 

First, I agree with you that as a passenger, he had no obligation to show ID.  But as others have said, this is a standard thing cops do.  I was once a deputy.  If I pulled over a vehicle, I would ask everyone in the car for their IDs.  No, none of the passengers HAD to give them to me, but most would. I would do this for several reasons:  possible warrants, simply to document who you spoke to, if a crime later occurs involving one, you now have a lead on 3 other people who knew their whereabouts.  Which brings me to my previous point: the reason is shown.  If he went missing, the girlfriend would be the prime suspect

Brother- I pointed out the brother because he is clearly depicted as unstable and overtly aggressive. The way he tries to fight Chris after Chris clearly refuses and shows no interest. Also the way he kinda slowly and methodically chose his words, his heavy breathing and long stares at characters adds to his unstableness. To me this was a play on the aggressive white male. *ahem* shooting schools *ahem*

The daughter literally turned the conversation on the phone with Chris's best friend to seduction while he was asking about Chris's well being. I remember the line ""oh c'mon I know you've always wanted to fuck me."" Also on the ride to the parents house, Chris's best friend is on speaker phone, and flirts with the daughter. Also as everyone turns on Chris at the front door the daughter replies ""sorry Chris, you were always one of my favorite.""
I say entitled because I don't know how you speak to police when you have interactions with them but in my experience the person who tries to tell the cop how to do their job doesn't usually get a long pause reply and then walk away in submission. 

There was a c;ear spot where Chris and the father are standing at the gazebo or whatever together sharing a moment as the sun was shining and they were agreeing on Obamas presidency. There isn't much after that they agree on at all. Not a great example, i'd happily dismiss this one 

I truly felt the brothers character was over the top. A few other moments especially with the rich people. 

It's kind of like I mentioned to another person who was asking about this. I understand the typical person knows most white people aren't like this. But there wasn't one white person who appeared on that movie screen in a 1 hr and 44 min span who was white and showed an ounce of sincere respect for a black person or their well being and who didn't treat them like a piece of property.
