Next scene - Helicopter battle and the sickest score of the movie.

It actually felt like a desperate fight by Helen when she's blinded by the screens and throwing furniture at the bad guy. I don't know..

e0p1e14,"Holy shit that was amazing, easily one of my favorites of the year. The action sequences were incredible, especially the helicopter scene.


It was great seeing all the powers played off each other and how they managed to counter one another, like Void making Violet's shields worthless.


I also love how Helen was able to fake having full blown hypoxia to Evelyn and trick her because she's a trained pilot and could handle high altitudes.


Some other thoughts: The fake Screenslaver watching her unlock the door was genuinely creepy. Edna Mode was back in full force and fucking killed it. Her absolute delight at Jack Jack's powers was hilarious, as was Jack Jack vs the racoon.",8r7d6q

e0p18f6,"I really really enjoyed the hell out of this movie, but it's not without a few flaws which keep it from being as good as the first Incredibles. 

The climax felt sort of rushed and predictable, especially compared to the first one which didn't let up the tension at all for the entire third act. Also, Helen's character arc somewhat felt like a rehash of Bob's character arc in the first movie when you think about it. The hero comes out of retirement for a new job opportunity while the significant other is at home taking care of the family, but the person they're working with turns out to actually be the villain pulling the strings and manipulating them the entire time. For a movie that was 14 years in the making, the story felt a little conservative and unimaginative in that regard.

Other than that though this was a really solid sequel and I hope Bird is thinking about a third film. I'd like to see another movie that's more daring in terms of world building, rather than one that retreads the familiar ground of the first film like this one does. The guy is seriously gifted at crafting imaginative action set pieces and I can't get enough of this universe and its characters. The Incredibles deserves to be Pixar's biggest franchise next to Toy Story in my opinion.",8r7d6q

e0r4pvx,"Yep, I enjoyed that. Not a masterpiece, but definitely good.

- Edna's scene was glorious, had me dying. ""Oh. My. God. YES."" Jack Jack in general made the film (lmao the raccoon fight).

- Helen vs. Screenslaver/Pizza Guy was badass. Dizzying, scary, and chaotic. I was seriously afraid for her there. Kudos to the crew for that scene, never seen anything like it from Pixar.

- The kids little arc this time made me smile, it was my favorite scene in the first movie and it didn't disappoint here. I'm really happy that car played such a role.

- I loved the new Supers. I kinda wish there had been more focus on them (besides Voyd and uncrush dude), but perhaps it would've felt too padded.

- Those goggles are *creepy*. Seeing these charismatic heroes turned into mindless drones was weird, but effective at getting you to fear them.

Overall, it was worth the wait. The family aspect was still strong and there were some amazing fight scenes.",8r7d6q
e0q6hs6,"Great sequel to my favorite Pixar movie of all time.

My favorite scene had to be the diner scene. Violet's face after she spit the water out of her nose was actually the most impressive computer animation in the movie to me. The way Bob and Dash were trying to impress Tony had me rolling in my seat as well.

The biggest negative to me was how much the new supers were different than the golden age heroes in terms of design. It went from supers who could conceivably fit in with an alter ego to mostly mutants.

I definitely agree with other comments in the thread that I2 would've benefitted from a straightforward villain instead of the ""twist"" villain.",8r7d6q
e0ra82b,"Really enjoyed it, 2 tiny nitpicks/questions:

* I don't remember Dash really using his powers for anything but casual mischief or comic relief.  He did the least saving of the day, but I felt he could have whipped the goggles off in the bridge similar to how he swiped the Incredi-ble remote from his dad earlier.

* I'm assuming Voyd can only create portals of a certain size, otherwise she could have redirected the ship easily.",8r7d6q
e0qcoe0,"Edna Mode Jack-Jack was the most adorable thing. I didn‚Äôt think they could top it.

e1ni8rw,"One thing I haven't seen mentioned, that I love, is how aware the professional supers plan for failure.

Frozone KNEW as good as he was, he couldn't hold off all those other supers. As soon as the Incredicar showed up, he transferred control to the kids because otherwise they wouldn't have escaped. For all Lucius knew, those other supers were going to kill him. His last thought was saving the kids before it was too late.

That, to me, is what makes a superhero, not saving the world. ",8r7d6q
e0p1vat,"I loved that this movie was genuinely funny. Even for being the longest computer-animated feature to date, it didn‚Äôt drag. I did feel like the final act of the film was rushed, it felt like they defeated the Screenslaver and saved the ship a little too easily. But apart from that, endlessly watchable and hilarious.

I just realized, Jack-Jack is a Jack of All Trades because he has so many powers!",8r7d6q
e0p6e8m,"This might seem like a weird complaint, but I wish this movie had more henchmen.

Like from an action standpoint the only people who they ever fight are mind controlled, so you‚Äôre not really rooting for them to get beat up because they aren‚Äôt really villains, which kinda keeps me from really getting into the action scenes. I like the mind control, but I wish they also had a committed group of henchmen who were actually committed to the cause.",8r7d6q
e0pygpj,"Living in Wisconsin, that Wisconsin joke really cracked up the whole theater. ",8r7d6q
e1hen8f,"
I think now that I've chewed on it a bit I think the biggest weakness of the sequel is that this movie lacks a lot of the emotional moments of the first film. We don't have anything that matches the moments from 1 such as the intense stress from the missile/jet scene, or it's aftermath where Bob thinks he's ready to finally kill someone, or his wife's suspicions of his adultery being washed away by his total devotion to her when she rescues him, or Bob's horror at discovering the truth and scale about the operations on the island and how many of his friends have died. It's mostly action oriented and most of the emotional notes are just about the characters figuring out what ""roles"" they want to fit into, and it's not nearly as satisfying as the original.",8r7d6q

e0rfh4u,"I can't be the only one who got a little excited at the Jonny Quest cameo on the TV.

Also, they did a pretty good job of making the Screenslaver pretty creepy, with the dead look, sign girl and the ""horror-eque"" glimpse of him inside the apartment when Elastigirl was breaking the lock. I frankly wished the reveal happened later in the movie, since the villain isn't as terrifying after.",8r7d6q
e0p1h42,This one felt more cartoony if that makes sense.,8r7d6q
e0re2zu,"Because most of what I want to say has already been said, I'll just add my 2 cents:

* The short right before the film, ""Bao"", absolutely tore me to pieces. I'm glad my friends didn't look over at me, I was struggling to keep my composure. Stories about moms raising their children from adorable, innocent children to (near) adults that end up hurting their feelings always are a guaranteed gut punch for me. Bravo!
* I didn't expect to so thoroughly... identify with Bob's struggle. For the first time, having to sit on the sidelines as someone else does the job he believed was his, having to take care of responsibilities he didn't really consider as his own, and watching as someone else gets all the accolades while he's stuck in a position where, despite his best efforts, success looks inhumanly far away...  That phone call scene after the hoverrail rescue was the first time in a really long time that I felt like I had actually made a meaningful connection to something on the screen, and I didn't know if I should be ashamed for being so selfish, or put at ease by knowing that other people go through the same thing.
   * ... I guess, sometimes, it's hard to be happy for the successes of the people you care about when you're not happy with yourself and don't feel like you've succeeded at all. Whether or not that happens to everyone, I don't know, but I guess it's something I need to improve on.",8r7d6q
e0t2rwm,"Outstanding movie, enjoyed it thoroughly. One small complaint, Dash's contribution at the climax was...to press a button. Why not have there be two buttons on opposite ends of the boat that need to be touched at the same time, and he has to run faster than he ever has to get to the second button before the first is fully released? I dunno, was looking for something incredible for him to do. Otherwise, it was flawless and I will be seeing it again as soon as possible. ",8r7d6q
e0p26sj,"For those people who for some reason are attracted to Elastigirl's badonkadonk, this movie will please you. Just about every other shot of her has her butt front and center.",8r7d6q
e0p4j5y,"The CGI in this movie is unreal. Crazy how much it's improved in the past 14 years. I also found the action to be really fun and inventive. Overall, and I imagine this won't be a popular opinion, but the movie just didn't grab me as much as the 1st. I wasn't too into the story and found the villain to be pretty weak. Definitely not a bad movie, but didn't live up to the first in my opinion",8r7d6q
e0p2l7i,Everything was great except the villain. The twist was too obvious and her motivation didn't really convinced me.,8r7d6q
e1ruvly,"Wow. Pretty good, But...


Anyone else very disappointed in villain reveal? When Screenslaver gives the first monologue as EG tracks him down (‚ÄúYou eat chips as you watch superheroes do the work for you.. you are not active participants in life‚Äù) I thought woah, this is a pretty good social commentary for a kids flick. I seriously think if they kept up the Villains role with that vibe it would have made the movie a more mature (albeit darker) and deeper film instead of the generic revenge villain we got. 
Pretty good, though. Can‚Äôt complain. Just wondering if I am not alone in thinking this",8r7d6q

Pros:

* Beautiful animation.
* Action scenes were great.
* The scenes with Bob at home with Jack-Jack were hilarious.
* The humor was funny for the most part. Everyone in my theater lost it when Violet shot water through her nose after seeing Tony at the diner.
* Theme of sexism felt natural and wasn't too forced.
* I was expecting a ton of forced references to the first film but I'm glad they didn't do that.

Cons:

* Villain was predictable and really weak, especially when compared to Syndrome.
* Third act felt rushed.

When they were walking down the hallway and Jack-Jack had the exact same walk and sass Edna had made me crack up. Plus I love the more in-depth characterization of Dash and Violet, Violet being one of my favorite characters this movie which I thought wouldn't happen.

I can‚Äôt find anyone else who feels this way, but does anyone think Jack Jack was too much of a plot convince? As a character he was great, but more towards the end it seems like his random powers just so happened to help out Violet and Dash.

e1kwugd,"I *loved* this movie.  But I did have one issue with it that I've had with many CG animated movies of the past decade or so, and that's the ""villain revealed"" troupe.  I miss when villains were out in the open, like Scar or Sydrome.  Now the villain is always played off as a surprise, like in Up, Frozen, Wreck It Ralph, and so many others I don't even want to bother to mention right now.

It not only gives the movie less time to build them up as the antagonist, but I now also find myself trying to guess who it will be, distracting my enjoyment of the movie itself.  And when the reveal is fairly obvious, takes away from the impact of the reveal itself.

The only things that bothered me a bit were Craig T. Nelson‚Äôs much older voice and the remarkably easy to see twist.

Right in the introductory scene when the siblings are talking about their father‚Äôs death, the brother says that if supers weren‚Äôt gone his father would have survived. The sister immediately countered with the line about saving themselves in the panic room and not needing a hero. TOO EASY a tell so early. If they would have removed the line, and toned down the dark imagery around her, maybe there would have been some surprise. 

Seriously, there was one shot where the brother was in the light of the sun at his desk while the sister sat dreary-eyed in the darkness. I get it, but if the twist is to work than cool it with the foreshadowing.

e0s0yx5,"Alright, let me start off by saying I thought the movie was amazing overall. The characters were all extremely well written and believable, everything progressed very naturally from and expanded on the events of the first movie, the world was built some more in a really cool, subtle way, the action was amazing, I laughed out loud several times, it was great. It earns its place as a worthy sequel in my opinion. However, it's definitely not as amazing as the first and I did see plenty of flaws, so I want to talk about those:

- Dash has absolutely nothing to do in this movie. Every other super in this movie gets a shining moment, a cool unique way to use their power, or some kind of an arc and Dash... doesn't. He's just there in some scenes. The only thing he even gets in the way of character development is learning to do his math homework. Big letdown after him running on water and learning control was one of the best moments of the original.

- Frozone also should've been used more and fleshed out. His couple of big scenes were great, especially the fight inside the house.

- The main villain reveal is kind of obvious. Granted, I thought it was mainly going to be the businessman who set the whole thing up so it was refreshing that he actually wasn't even in on it, but it still wasn't surprising that it was at least one of those siblings. I do think the minor argument they had about the saferoom early on was clever as setup, as I hadn't guessed it at that point. Also, it seems strange that Helen wouldn't be more suspicious of the rich benefactor offering her some redemptive hero work since that's almost an *exact mirror* of the situation Bob got into in the first movie that almost killed their whole family. It's only been, like, a couple months at most maybe?

- The evil sister really could've used a little more development and motivation. I liked her conversations with Helen a lot but they weren't that much and they didn't really expand her character much either. Her evil motivation just ended up feeling really contrived to the point I honestly think I would've preferred the Screenslaver to actually just be a really cool new villain we had never met before with his own crazy plot.

- The visual design of the newer supers looked really wacky and out of place to me, and it was kind of distracting. Up until now all the supers we've seen have been relatively realistically proportioned humans, and now we suddenly get a whole room full of crazy proportions, animal hybrids, and one or two that are just straight up almost grotesque. I thought it was a strange and annoyingly inconsistent design change.

- ***My biggest one***: The movie touches on some really interesting and complex themes early on that I thought it was going to really dig into, but then just drops them as soon as the fake Screenslaver is captured. Helen and Bob argue about whether it's best for supers just to follow the law even when the law is restrictive and unfair, the fight with the Underminer is ultimately a failure and raises questions about whether supers are too risky and destructive for the real world, the plan to restore the public's faith in supers literally involves them wearing bodycams for accountability the exact same way many cops now do, the Screenslaver argues that supers are just flashy distractions for people to gawk at rather than real solutions... That's all really deep and mature, and it all seems like it's building to a really cool point with some amount of heft or payoff right up until Elastigirl tracks down the decoy guy and fights him. None of Elastigirl's missions ever fail or result in damage, the public are all just okay with superheroes, the moral debating stops all together, and everything just suddenly turns into a simple fight between the heroes and the twist villain. It's still great action and a ton of fun, but it feels like all the important themes kind of got dismissed for the sake of keeping the movie light. I think if the movie had stuck to its guns and really followed through on these things it could've come closer to the greatness of the original, but maybe the creators consciously chose not to do that because there's already so many superhero movies out now that try to do all the moral hee-hawing about this stuff.

Here's my idea for that last bullet point: One of Elastigirl's missions needs to fail. Imagine if instead of the fight with the decoy Screenslaver going fine, it ends in disaster. Helen chases him out of the building and fails to see the self-destruct activation. The building explodes just like in the movie, but some people inside are actually *killed*. The cops soon realize the kid in their custody is no genius supervillain. Now Helen has failed in a terrible way, there are big casualties, and everybody knows she hasn't even captured the real Screenslaver. It's the Underminer fight again, but more heartbreaking. There is a public uproar and debates after support for supers has been on the rise, the bodycam footage starts getting twisted and used against them. Elastigirl questions herself and goes on hiatus back to the family, where she is actually kind of bothered to find everything running relatively smoothly without her, plus she missed Jack-Jack's first powers. Everything makes her feel super detected and misplaced. The Dev siblings fight about these events and the sister convinces her brother to host some kind of summit or debate or something onboard their ship instead of the legalization ceremony from the movie. This is still an event that will turn the tide of the superhero legalization debate, though, and the whole world is watching. The siblings invite both Elastigirl and Mr. Incredible back to prepare them and get them both back in the public eye. Of course, the Screenslaver is still out there and secretly pulling strings to set his/her evil plan in motion. From here the movie's events can mostly play out like they did, with one more major change: the Screenslaver, whether he's secretly the Dev sister or not, needs to keep his motivation parallel to the main theme of the movie rather than pivoting to a simple personal revenge story. In the final act of the movie he needs to argue that supers are dangerous and unchecked and unnecessary. Maybe instead of the background story we see in the movie, the Screenslaver's father was actively killed in the collateral damage of a super fight gone wrong, just like the apartment Helen raided. Now we've got way more of a central connecting theme and emotional resonance behind the whole thing. The Screenslaver's identity reveal could even be a big tearjerker. Leave red herrings to secretly make the audience think it's the evil businessman like I originally assumed, then (surprise!) it turns out he's also been under mind control and it was really the sister all along. The brother is heartbroken and ashamed and the story about their father is painful enough for Elastigirl to sympathize with after her own failure. And then from here again play it out as usual, thrilling fight and Speed 2 scenario and everything, until the very end when the supers succeed and prove themselves in the public eye. Conclude on a more nuanced solution that integrates supers into the systems already there like insurance and police, minimizing risk of public harm and maximizing the good they can do. Compromises on both sides. 

And finally, end the movie with the family going after a cooler villain than a random car chase. Maybe the Underminer returns!

Again, I reeeaaaally really liked the movie as is, but these were my specific thoughts on how it could've been closer to the original in terms of quality and complexity.",8r7d6q
e0p847z,"This doesn't diminish the overall quality of the movie, but is anyone else disappointed with how little Dash had to do?

I thought back to the original and how Violet barely had any ""super"" moments so it makes sense that she takes a big spotlight in the sequel. However, it seemed that everyone other than Dash had their time to shine, and Dash is just tagging along for the ride.

Especially power wise, we really only see him zip through to get from place to place, and not in a superhero life/death kind of thing. Barely any real usage of his powers and even less during the setpieces At least some of his lines were funny but he didn't have much time to speak to begin with. 

I know it's a weird thing to be hung up on, but he's my favorite of the family and I was certainly expecting more from him.

As for my thoughts on the film, it definitely pales in comparison to the first but it's still great anyway. The plot isn't much different from the first, the villain isn't as good as Syndrome, the third act was very formulaic and rushed, and it doesn't have the courage to delve into darker, more sinister themes like the first one did (shooting children, dysfunctional marriage, hero threatening an innocent, etc). 

That being said, it's still a damn good time at the movies as it's hilarious throughout, the action scenes with Elastigirl are major standouts, and seeing Bob slowly degrade as a stay-at-home dad is so satisfying to behold. Oh, and Jack-Jack steals every scene he's in, hands down.",8r7d6q

Some things I liked: 

-	Jack Jack is awesome
-	The animation blew me away (I watched the first right before this one and oh man the difference)
-	The family dynamic was there yet again
-	The action was amazing

Some negatives: 

-	I‚Äôm not fond of the whole ‚Äúnew superheroes group‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt find them very charming or likable
-	The plot was pretty predictable but that‚Äôs alright
-	I feel like this movie didn‚Äôt have as much of a message as the last one. For example, the family was so dysfunctional and slowly falling apart but they eventually learned that family is key. Cliche, yes. But it worked. In this movie I didn‚Äôt really feel like there was anything to take away.

The action and fight sequences were all highly entertaining, nothing wrong there, but I would have loved a fight between the parents, Lucius, and the kids. In terms of plot however, nothing ever built up. It felt like over half the film was exposition, and then somehow we were already on the boat and heading towards the climax of the film. I felt that the writers touched upon lots of different sub-plots, such as 
the legality of supers, Helen vs Bob, Bob taking care of the family, Violet and Tony, but we didn't get a chance to feel emotionally invested in the story as much as the first one. ",8r7d6q

e3oq3dh,"Saw it just yesterday.

I thought it was good, but I need to rewatch the first movie to confirm issues. 

These are my questions, and in ways complaints haha. 

1. The babysitter knew about Jack Jack's powers in the first movie. Are we assumed to believe she was memory wiped before she could tell the Parr family? The scene about Jack Jack's powers is likely to not have been seen by the family from high up, but the baby sitter would have known right? 
2. The enemy was sadly very typical. I knew it was either one of them, and looking back I should have known better it was Evelyn. I had hoped it would have been an entirely different antagonist altogether.  
3. Evelyn 's  motivation is definitely a little contrived. Heroes were already illegal, so the only concern she had to do was argue with her brother and say ""No Brother, depending on heroes is WHY we have no parents. THERE WAS A SAFE ROOM"". This would have saved a lot more time and money, unless her goal was to ruin her brother's image of superheroes because she cared about him. Syndrome's motivation is a little better because he has actual experience with Mr. Incredible to fuel revenge, and he actually kind of had a good point about heroes: that because of their powers they thought they were better than other people (Not the theory I believe in, but what Syndrome believed especially after the way Mr. Incredible treated him)
4. How forgetful is Troy? Violet wears the same thing all the time and he can't recognize her at the restaurant?

Other than that, I did love the whole ""Stay at home Dad"" because we get to see him try really hard as a father...and they could have easily just made him say that it was not his job to care for the kids, and what not.  

My favorite line in the movie was ""I have to succeed, so SHE can succeed."" Sure, he definitely was going to benefit if she got the law lifted, but what started out as a way to benefit him made him start on sincerely helping out his kids. He no longer cared about the law, but making sure that Jack Jack's powers were in control, that Dash could finish his homework, and that he could sort out Violet's relationship with Troy. At the end, he just really wanted to be a good father, and that touched me a lot. 

Also good moments: Edna Mode with Jack Jack, and Jack Jack with the raccoon. Edna Mode is a classic even if she only appears for such short time. ",8r7d6q

incredibles 2 is good, but it never gets anywhere close to having moments on that level. You never really worry that anyone is going to suffer. The action is ~incredible~ but it feels more like a standalone episode of an Incredibles series than a movie with high stakes or anything.",8r7d6q

I'm was always a bit hesitant about them doing another (not that I don't trust Pixar, but sequels can be rough) but after this I'd be down for even a third one. Also worth nothing, Bao was beautiful and damn near made me cry.",8r7d6q

e0uqn2x,"There's a lot that has already been said on this thread. There's one big thing I want to touch on but I'll hit the quick points first. Good: entertaining beginning to end, great action sequences with clever twists and expansions of the original cast's powers, deeper exploration of main casts characters, hilarious and relatable moments throughout, all-in-all would recommend and it's well worth the ticket (unless you're the cynical type, which brings us to our bad points). Bad: very predictable storyline, weak story-arcs as no one is really going a through personal journey this time around. The first movie ends with each character growing as individuals, but that doesn't really happen in this second film. Everyone's basically just along for the ride in the logical continuation from where the first movie left off.  


Good and bad out of the way, the number one thing I wish they did: **they should have shown the death of Deavor's parents as a full sequence, not as a quick flashback.** The movie opens with a strong premise that wasn't capitalized as well as it could have: do supers really make us safer, or does their presence actually put us in more danger? The rest of the movie would have been a masterful play on that theme: the city would not have been destroyed by the underminer, Violet would still have her date, Bob would still have his job, Deavor's parents would still be alive. That would have given us sympathy for the (predictable) villain. I feel like if the theme of I2 were more focused, it would have been a masterpiece in its own right, rather than just a ""good sequel"". Evelyn's character could have been a home run ‚Äî she had some interesting moments: all her dialogue before her lackluster monologue where she reveals herself as the bad guy (evil-lyn, anyone?) was actually pretty interesting. Her televised Screenslaver speech hinted at a deeper philosophy worth exploring. But the lack of sympathy made an otherwise deep character feel shallow.

One thing I will say about Brad Bird, I've always been a big fan of his, especially because of his work on The Simpsons, but he tries to use a character how they would. For example, when Elastigirl is on the motorcycle how she fights makes absolute sense to her character, the entire train sequence is also a brilliant piece of animation. 

Even though I absolutely loved the animation and direction, the script let it down, Mr.Incredible trying to be a good dad was great but outside of that it felt like an action movie. The Incredibles was so wonderful because it was a family story, the villain was secondary and it was really the family struggling to find their place in the world. Incredibles 2 has the same themes, but it concentrates too much on ""villain of the week"" plot and loses the charm the first had. ",8r7d6q

Yeah, the story was a little bland but the action sequences which drive it were perfect. I was totally blown away by the animation of Elastigirl fighting Screenslaver in the cage, looked so damn cool.

I also think it's a lot funnier than the first film and, amazingly, every joke landed perfectly with me. Jack Jack Vs Raccoon 2018 had me in hysterics the whole time.

I'm also glad the kids got more focus in this film, with Violet being really nicely developed and probably one of the best characters.

Something I found really damn cool was how the music was composed so that it would have little flairs which matched the action. It really added to the intensity of the chases and proves that Giachino is maybe the best film composyout there right now.

Barring the Toy Story franchise (Although TS4 may leave some things to be desired) this is the best Pixar sequel we've seen thus far. Cars 2 felt like a souless cashgrab whilst Cars 3 earnestly tried, but it still falls just below to around average. Monsters University was bland and hit every single trope of the college/university movie genre without adding anything new or fresh. Finding Dory really had no reason to exist while still trying to hit the emotional marks that the first story held, and missing them mostly.


What sets Incredibles 2 apart from the rest is the passion and fun that went into it. Yeah, it's pretty much what you'd expect but it has fun with itself to show off more of the characters and their interactions. It's a great popcorn flick that really fits the style of a classic James Bond and Superhero family mashup. To be fair, the first Incredibles was nothing *special* as it followed the tropes of many super hero family and spy-thriller stories beforehand, but what it does it does it pretty well, and I was thoroughly entertained. Is it the next Toy Story, Up, or Coco? No, but it isn't trying to be. And unlike Cars 2 which tried to shoehammer the spy and action elements in, here they just worked so much better.


My only two complaints with the film rest on the villain and Edna Mode. Firstly, Edna Mode is more of a *minor* gripe that doesn't ruin the movie, but it does bug me. in the first film she plays a major role as a minor character, setting up Mr. Incredible's suit as well as the family *and* forwarding the story with the tracker device that shows Helen where her husband is *as well as* getting Mr. Incredible captured. In the second movie, she is more or less just a fanservice character that just makes a new suit for Jack-Jack and nothing beyond that. And as for the villain? Without saying too much in a rant, I really wish they went for a more traditional comic/super-hero styled villain rather than the two-faced reveal that was seen a mile away. Besides, they could have gone all out with the villain and had a lot of fun, whilst the villain we got in the movie was just kinda so-so and not fun or menacing at all (Other than the pixie haircuit and heavy eyeshadow, which I know some people will dig)",8r7d6q

e19zcxj,"It was okay. There were parts I liked, and others I really didn't care for. To me, the things that stood out the most involved the family interaction and Bob learning how to play a bigger role in the family. The villain plot felt... lackluster? It was obvious who the villain would be but that is fine, but if I compared the villains from the 1 and 2, Syndrome wins. He had way more charisma. One thing I wished was if there was more of a 'super' villain. Someone with actual powers instead of another 'person jaded because of heroes in the past causing family drama'. I did have to remember this is a movie for kids and I kept positive during the whole thing. The B team superheroes were kinda fun. Reflux being a rather gross, yet interesting power, and Void with portals. Also, the guy that crushes things, a bit to into crushing things.

e2sgi5d,"Years of watching Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, and I feel incredibly (pun intended) stupid for not recognizing Bob Odenkirk's voice.

Back when the first Incredibles movie aired, it was a great substitute for the Fantastic Four movie that we deserved but never really have a chance to get (hopefully this could change when the F4 eventually joins the MCU).

Not bad for a sequel. While it was obvious that the villain is somehow connected to the Deavor siblings, I thought it was both of them in on the act, in order to stage a crime by creating a fictional villain in order to further their pro-super agenda, and the Incredibles would be forced into a dilemma of stopping that from happening, even though it may harm their chances of becoming legit again. 

Turns out it was just the sister attempting to sabotage her brother's ""naive"" worshipping of heroes. Though perhaps for a generally kids-oriented movie, this option is obviously less darker.

Jack-Jack is obviously the scene-stealer with his plethora of overpowered abilities. lol All that's left is for Edna Mode to figure out a way to further harness his powers and he'll be nigh on incredible (another intended pun).

Really glad I did too. I was a little worried due to the trailers seemingly pushing the comedic *""Dad tries taking care of the kids for once""* trope but it was honestly well-paced and actually entertainingly funny.

I guessed the main Villain of the movie really early on but, fortunately, that never took away how good the movie was. Nothing to really complain about the Villain nor their plan. Though I am glad that the Villain ended up being the person I guessed and didn't cop out to be someone else. **EDIT: There's actually one gripe. The ""seizure"" flashing of the screens was a bit much.**

The creative use of powers working together was nice. Although the *""powerlevel/feat guy""* part of me wanted to see some hardcore 1v1 brawl but this isn't that kind of movie and I was still satisfied by everyone playing their parts. It was nice seeing everyone struggle and not be able to solve and handle everything by themselves. 

Surprisingly very little in-your-face Female Power talk. Originally in the trailers, where the CEO guy wanted Elastigirl to be the main face of his operation. People suspected the whole *""the world wants more women to be in the forefront now!""* but no, his reasoning was actually very logical and simple. Seeing Mr. Incredible get jealous about it was funny too. There was that brief talk between Elastigirl and CEO Guy's sister but that was more about their ideals and was, again, never in-your-face Girl Power.

I feel like the film lack salient arcs and edification. Screenslaver had a huge monologue about people being glued to their electronics and screens, something that applies today but it was dove into deeper. 

Was there an arc for Helen? I feel like there was a setup there for being accepting of bending the rules (seems Winston really did have influence over the police chief) to change it or putting more trust into her family to take care of themselves. 

What was Bob's arc? Being Mr. Mom isn't that easy? Dash had no personal drama at all. 

Did Violet suddenly accepts being a super after listening to her Dad tell her how hard he's trying? 

Evelyn was an obvious villain reveal aside from the fact that the brother wasn't involved. Like others said, her flashback being the intro for the film would have been better and made her more sympathetic.

I thought the villain plot was predictable and meh. Nothing will beat Syndrome, but it's a hard villain to follow. 

All the development of the family's powers and interactions with each other, as well as the other heroes, was so good! I loved seeing more powers, which I thought the first one did not do as much. They fleshed out many relationships and that was so worth.

I found the villain of Incredibles 2 to be a bit underwhelming, less interesting than Syndrome. Wasn't as ""dark"" as the first, and I guess I was hoping for something a little different.

Yes they're supers but the Parrs and Lucious all look like normal people despite the suits. The other's designs just bothered me I guess.

As soon as it started playing though, I was right back into it. Full attention. I guess that's the power of a fun story mixed with some nostalgia. There were things I didn't like, but they were mostly nitpicks. I'm not a fan of the inept dad trope, and it looked like they were going to subvert it, but then they go right back to Mr. Incredible is tired and incompetent. Shrug. Par for the course. Everything else was fine, even the Jack Jack stuff which I expected to be not very funny. Elastigirl was my favorite character from the first one, partly because there's a *lot* of interesting things you can do visually with stretch powers, and they pushed it to the limit. Great stuff.

Edna was of course going to show up, but they didn't lean on the ""hey, remember this character from the first one?"" as the joke. Her scenes were funny and stand fine on their own. Overall, I enjoyed the movie a whole lot, and I'm glad we got it, even if it took literally doubling my age to make it happen.",8r7d6q

e3bw5w1,"Despite not quite being the superlative magnum opus that the first The Incredibles was, fans and admirers of Brad Bird's modern animated classic have nothing to be worried about- the sequel that was fourteen years in the making is well...it's quite incredible. 

Yes, this movie is a worthy successor, and it's one of those films that has a little something for everybody. 

For animation fans who desperately yearn to see gorgeously rendered, near photorealistic 3D drawings, one needs to look no further than Incredibles 2. 

Do you prefer a stylistic approach instead? Incredibles 2 has that too, maintaining Incredibles 1's 1960s spy movie chic. 

Do you miss the days of old school Buster Keaton style slapstick? All of the scenes featuring baby Jack-Jack, particularly the one where he battles a determined raccoon, are not only reminiscent of Keaton, but these scenes are just as incredibly funny and incredibly reminiscent of  the pre-talkie comedian. For what it's worth, the scenes with Jack-Jack were my favorite part of the movie, and he and the raccoon were my favorite characters. 

For fans of the domestic comedy-drama of the Parr family, they all remain just as charming and relatable and wry as they were in the first movie. Starting directly after the first movie was a smart move, because all of the characters we see in the first movie develop some intriguing character development that I would be interested in following in a third film.

For those who appreciated the satire of the superhero genre the first movie provided, that's all here too, while also adding a few new drops of social commentary of its own. Without spoiling anything, the motivation behind the villain Screenslaver is intriguing, although underdeveloped, and a new character named Voyd was suggestive of some subtle but interesting LBGTQ themes. The (perhaps unintentional) theme running throughout all of Brad Bird's films of exceptional people constantly being sabotaged or threatened at every turn by less exceptional people envious of their talents is here as well, although it's far more subtle than the first Incredibles played it.

Ignoring all that, do you just want a good old adventure movie? I'm pleased to say that the action sequences in this are just as if not more pulse pounding than the action scenes you'll find in live action. The powers of the various superhero characters are utilized very creatively and hold up upon repeat viewings.

Ultimately, if the plot is a little shaky and doesn't hold up to scrutiny upon examination, that doesn't really matter, because the family dynamics and the world that the Parr's live in is so vibrant, so rich, and so imaginative, its lapses in narrative logic are forgivable. This is how you do a sequel. ",8r7d6q

My biggest gripe was the villain. [This comment basically sums of my feelings perfectly](https://www.reddit.com/r/blankies/comments/8qyjwl/what_did_you_think_of_incredibles_2/e0q1uuz/). She felt bland with minimal background so the motive felt weak (blaming her parents instead of the robbers). Syndrome's path was laid out perfectly and they explained how he became who he was. Having no or minimal background works when the character is interesting enough to cover it up. She wasn't interesting enough. I wish the mole dude was in the movie more now that I think about it.

Violet was basically back at square one from the first movie. That was kind of lame. Dash is hilarious. Bob adjusting to being the stay at home parent was entertaining. All the Jack Jack scenes were fantastic, and I wish there were more. Edna is my spirit animal. Elastigirl is thicc af.

I thought there was going to be more to the villain. 

The actual plan was going along amazingly until we got to the boat scene. Idk but I thought it was dealt with way too easily, the evil plot of crashing a boat was way too basic compared to mind control capabilities and the way they stopped the villain and wrapped it up was really brisk.

 I found the backstory for the villain to not have been fleshed out very well either, didn‚Äôt have much impact and it was super obvious who it was.

e12div1,"While I enjoyed the film, I still can't get over Evelyn's methods for trying to paint supers in a bad light and stop them from returning. I'm looking for answers to these questions:

1. If Evelyn's brother is trying to bring supers back, why not hypnotize him or find an alternative method to stopping his supers plan (either convince him or defund his projects somehow)?

2. Why create the Screenslaver persona at all? He's been shown to publicly hypnotize people via the Elastigirl interview incident, which of course makes people act out of character. When the supers start wrecking havoc on the cruise ship, people would know that they're being mind controlled due to what has happened in the past few days (as well as their goggles).

3. Adding to the previous question, why not hypnotize Elastigirl when they first met? That way Elastigirl wouldn't be able to gain public support through her activities like stopping the train. If the supers were hypnotized at the start and no one knew of the Screenslaver's mind control, then maybe Evelyn's plan could of worked.",8r7d6q
e15rg1m,"I was underwhelmed by the villain. The motivations were there: it was both anti-super and anti-technology, all bundled by an overarching anti-dependence. The backstory checked out too, but it didn't quite click to make a holistic and convincing act. Kinda a shoddier Lex Luthor. 

Eta: It didn't help that it really felt irrelevant to the real conflict of the bigger conflict, the work-home balance of the Parr family. The villain's motivations really contrasted to the main supporter's motivations, too -- it was so obivous that he had personal reasons to be pro-super, but you just don't feel the same about the villian.

The movie was excellent, the animated fight scenes had me gaping, especially the cage match with ScreenSlaver. I loved Helen as Elastigirl and her occasional mum jokes, and Bob's various breakdowns. All the sibling shenanigans were very fun,  I think my favourite parts were Jack-Jack picking up Edna's mannerisms, the oxygen deprivation scene, Violet learning offensive ways to use her shielding, the baby-passing scenes, and Bob's face and the voice acting during his conversation with Lucius about Jack-Jack's powers.



(I'm writing future fic in my head where Jack-Jack still has most of his powers and Bob keeps encouraging him to be a super hero while all Jack-Jack really wants to do is design fashionable physics-defying hero gear with his Aunt Edna and Bob really really tries to be supportive, especially when Helen's looking,  but it's hard, and idk the theme is you can be more than one thing and it doesn't have to be all or nothing, moderation, so Jack Jack ends up being someone to call in for the huge stuff (which most ppl are happy about since he never quite got the hang of damage control?) and otherwise he's making awesome suits and gadgets)",8r7d6q

I mean this movie ALMOST had a great little message to it, with Violet being upset at the hypocrisy of her mom being a hero by breaking the law. Having a villain be a guy who wants to help so he does bad things would only have fed into that theme.

Instead Violet is just dismissed as an angsty teen and the actual villain's actual motivation was far less interesting.

e18ouli,"I feel as if everyone's obsessed over whether or not it's better than the first movie, but honestly that doesn't really matter. I think they realized that trying to top the first movie was impossible so they went in a different direction for this movie and did an excellent job. ",8r7d6q
e19vn9b,"This really felt like ""more incredibles"" to me. 

It was fine, and I loved the characters, the music, the design, the animation, but the story left a little to be desired. I felt like the general thrust of this was pros and cons of hero worship, but that never really played out in the story to any definitive end. 

Evelyn and Winston clearly represent both sides of that argument, but I felt like Winston should have had a moment where the flip side (heroes inspire regular people to heroic action) was shown more clearly. Would have loved a moment where Winston is stuck between ""waiting"" for a super or acting on his own to save someone else and chooses the latter. 

Overall, I'm glad it exists because I love spending more time with these characters, but it still doesn't break the streak of unnecessary pixar sequels. Still feels like Toy Story 2 and 3 are the only ones that really nailed it. ",8r7d6q

Every scene, every line of dialog, every minute detail all serve to enrich the world.  No scene goes to waste.  The closest you get to a ""throwaway"" scene is the ""no capes!"" joke, but then even *that* turns out to be highly relevant to plot of the film.  That whole film is a fine-tuned machine of character-driven story.

The second film is good, but feels more like a hodgepodge of episodes than a cohesive story.  Still a blast, though.",8r7d6q
e0q1qsm,"Loved it loved it loved it.

The action and comedy were both excellent. People are harping on about the villain reveal being predictable, but I really don't care about whether it was predictable or not if it was well done, which I think it was.

The closest things to nitpicks I have are that Craig T. Nelson sounded his age a few times and it kinda took me out of it (there's nothing you can do about that though, and it wasn't a major issue) and that the decision to pick up right where the last one left off made the beginning a little bit clunky.

e0zb9fe,"This one lacked the meta jokes of the original, like the monologuing bit.  This one also didn't have the super cool team use of super powers like the original, like dash running on water or the hamster ball.

This one was 50% a straight up super hero movie and 50% Mr. Mom.  Jack Jack and Edna stole the show.  Most of the humor came from those two...for me at least.  The identity of the villain was predictable.  The Mr. Mom half of this movie really carried this film.  The super hero half of this film was pretty generic.  It didn't have the ""james bond"" feel of the original.  A lot of that may have to do with the villain.  Syndrome was a far better super-villain.  His island lair provided such an amazing set.

The artwork was amazing.  The hair looked great.  Every strand of hair behaved independently.  Wet hair actually looked really good in this one.  Didn't look plasticky like the original.  There was a translucency to the skin in this one.  A lot more use of shadows and light. every surface, every bump, every particle reacts to light.  The effect of light and shadows on clothing especially looked gorgeous to me. Just an absolutely beautiful film.  Although the character models stayed the same, the improvements in technology and animation was stark.

I didn't love it as much as the original, which to this day remains in my top 3 or 4 animated movies of all time.  This iteration was a solid 8 for me.  Fun movie.  Great family film.  But doesn't transcend the genre like the original did.",8r7d6q
e16h86b,"Dash didn't really have much to do in this one, eh? Most of the action scenes were in fairly enclosed spaces, so they never got to show the full use of his power and while it seems like Helen, Bob and Violet all had some form of emotional journey or development, he didn't get anything on that front.

Overall I thought it was a great movie, though not as great as the first one. The visuals alone make this one worth rewatching plenty, but it just wasn't as tightly focused as the first.",8r7d6q
e2u9yeu,"I feel like that movie was overhyped. It's good sure but it's nothing exceptional and to me, it doesn't arrive to the level of the first one. It's a good animated movie for sure but IMO, Pixar can do much better (it's not their worst movie ever though for sure). It's a very predictable, by the numbers sequel (like often in the superhero genre btw). 

The villain is very generic, has a plan that doesn't make sense, the twist is visible from miles away (I basically knew it, from the first time we met Evelyn),... well it's not Syndrome. The movie seems also way less mature than the first because of this lackluster villain (and the other parts of the plot too).

The action is good but nothing exceptional and despite 14 years of animation progress and such, doesn't compare to the first one action. The island chase, the plane missiles or the fight against the machine in the city from the first are all superior to all the actions there. The best action parts there were probably the two where Elastigirl is alone (train and helicopter) but that means that the other members of the family have no cool scenes with their powers. Worst being Dash which is completely underused. And considering what we've seen from the superhero genre in the 14 years between the two, it's quite disapointing.

As for the characterization and plot for the family, it was good but I don't know, it didn't left me with a big impression like the first one did. Helen was obviously the main character of the movie and it was probably the best part (though she goes against a lackluster villain). Bob parenting was source of gags for sure but nothing special like the dealing with the midlife crisis in the first movie. The kids have fine-meh plots, though Dash is again completely forgotten for Violette there (seriously his plot is basically learning to do math stuff ?). Frozone and Edna still works well as supporting characters. And now Jack Jack, probably the second most important character after Helen (maybe even above her), the movie has way too much of him IMO (especially because it's just a baby that have all powers and can't control them, make some funny scenes but not the best for story).

So yeah overall, a fine movie but Pixar can do much better (though I do always prefer their original movies to their sequels), even other studios do regularly better. I preferred Finding Dory to this while I much prefer Incredibles 1 to Nemo.",8r7d6q
e8e3ts5,"I was kind of disappointed. The first half of the movie, which is near the one hour mark, felt like a huge drag. The plot moved at a snail's pace and the politics on superheroes seemed to be hammered in a bit too much.

I really wanted Bob to be more competent since the 'dad can't take care of the kids alone' trope is boring after seeing it so many times in film/television. I'm not saying the fact that they used that trope is automatically bad, but there's not enough indication that he wouldn't be able to handle raising the kids. There are a lot of modern dads that are great staying at home and raising a family. I would've liked to see something different. If he resolved the family issues sooner we could see more familial teamwork for more of the movie, which would help with the plot pacing.

Holly Hunter sounded very similar to Carrie Fisher in this movie. It was disorienting. Her voice didn't really match the character. I know it's the same actress but after 14 years the difference is noticeable.

The twist was obvious after the first incident. Her motives and her talents were way too easy to predict. And, as others said, it never felt like there was a real threat. The characters just handled everything the way they normally do and all was fine. Seemed like a core writing issue. 

Baby jokes - even with super powers, got tiring after maybe the 2nd time. I don't like baby jokes because we've seen and heard all of them before. We get it. They poop, they make messes, they run off, they don't sleep when we want them to. It would've been nice if he wasn't so integrated into the plot. We didn't actually see any development from Jack Jack, and his issues take away character agency from more interesting problems.

Parts I did like about the movie were Bob Odenkirk's great voice acting, the animation (obviously), any scene involving Frozone, Dash playing with remotes, and parts where Elastigirl was investigating Screenslaver. There was real tension when she was walking through the gadget/broadcasting hideout, and searching for more clues would've played well with the Incredibles aesthetic. Maybe in another time.

Overall I'd say it was average.",8r7d6q

e0qkfi4," It seems like whenever I‚Äôm a fan of something and it takes them 10 or so years to make the sequel, the sequel just isn‚Äôt as good. This also applies to TFA, Finding Dory etc. The movie was very predictable with the villain reveal which, to be fair is something almost every Disney and Pixar film has done for freaking forever, but there‚Äôs just something about this one that doesn‚Äôt feel as exciting. The first one had giant robots, a remote tropical setting, and also got really dark and edgy at times. This one didn‚Äôt feel like it had the stakes as the first one. Syndrome was a genocidal maniac while ScreenSlaver (I don‚Äôt even remember what the hell her real name was) had very weak motivations. The movie also wasn‚Äôt as funny as the first one. It seems like the more mature themes of the first one have to take a backseat to silly baby scenes. This is by no means a bad movie, I actually genuinely loved the first half, however it most certainly got progressively worse as the film went on. There really wasn‚Äôt much emotion to this one, it just seemed too safe. Overall, it‚Äôs just okay.",8r7d6q

e0rbat7,"I love Jonathan Banks but I think he‚Äôs becoming the ‚Äúgruff old guy voice‚Äù whenever there‚Äôs a cast change, which is a really specific pigeonhole.

I really loved the movie overall. Just wish they would have taken the Screenslaver idea a little further than personal resentment and a ‚Äúsave the day‚Äù thing. I know it was meant to be a convenient, for the cameras ruse, but once she was found out and explained herself it felt like Evelyn was just personally mad at her dad and brother. Something about it just didn‚Äôt feel quite next level villain-y the way Syndrome was. Like it almost wanted to say something about heroes as a whole with Screenslaver but ultimately was content with having less adept takes on nostalgia and hero worship than in the first movie. It also didn‚Äôt feel like the Parr family's core ideas about heroism changed that much by the end. It was nice they said things about the way other superhero movies are (casualties, the bit about Mr Incredible causing a lot of collateral damage with his methods), but in the current glut of superhero movies it was a bit disappointing to see it play with the archetypes without quite challenging them. 

The B plot, however, was excellent. They carried the family themes to the next logical step really well and I did feel like Bob grew as a character. Jack Jack I knew would be funny but the raccoon bit was one of the funniest sequences I've seen this year. I wouldn‚Äôt say no to a sequel if they can come up with an equally compelling ‚Äúnext step‚Äù for the Parrs as a family! Also realistically I just wouldn‚Äôt say no to a sequel.",8r7d6q

e3adxlv,"Really enjoyed this one. I recently revisited **The Incredibles (2004)** in preparation for this one and forgot just how good it was. 

That being said, I think this one more than holds its own. I think it's just as good as the first one on most fronts. I liked the shift in dynamic with having Bob take care of the kids. Giving Elastigirl the spotlight helped us get a new perspective on her character, as reluctant as she might have been to do it initially. 

Jack-Jack was absolutely the highlight of the film and his bits were definitely the best. Super funny and wildly entertaining. 

I liked the shift in focus to the kids as well. The bickering between Violet and Dash is entertaining, and the part where they team up to fight the other supers who are wearing the goggles is pretty good. 

The action scenes in general are really well done. Even at the beginning, the fight against the Underminer was the perfect way to open the film IMO. 

As far as complaints, I don't have many. The Screenslaver's goals are a little contrived because supers were already outlawed, but I can overlook that. I like the concept of the Screenslaver, and enjoyed the point the villain was trying to make against complacency. 

Definitely the best animated movie I've seen in a long time. Worth the wait? I'd have to say yes. I'd score it 4.5/5. ",8r7d6q

I love how within this one they have Elastigirl be the face of the project and show Mr. Incredible as the stay at home parent. It showed both sides of parenting and did it brilliantly. The charm and humor of the family being a family is what really makes these movies and they did fantastic at keeping it real and funny. 

The villan's fine. This one felt more like a Zemo villain instead of a Thanos. The villain wasn't built up a ton, sorta just stayed in the back, and didn't interact with the heros face to face til the end. Where as with Syndrome we get him throughout the movie and learn his backstory and get to see a darker villian. I don't think this hurt the movie overall, as it was super enjoyable, I don't take points off a movie for doing a cliche if it's done right.

And the sound track is still amazing.",8r7d6q
e0q8bge,"Definitely has been a while since I just sat with a big grin for like an hour straight. 

The villain definitely wasn't as good in the sense that at no point did I really think danger existed -- Syndrome had ships and a robot that could feasibly let him do some real damage; Screenslaver was just a person using an isolated terrorism incident trying to make heroes illegal.. which they already were.

Despite the main driving point of the movie being much weaker, I thought the overall experience was actually better just because everything else was done so well.",8r7d6q
e0r1vfk,"I thought it was really entertaining but it felt like too much of a retread of the first one. Sure, if you pick up right where you left off in the first movie, you'll have to continue the whole ""general public not liking/trusting superheroes"" thing again, but it felt like there were more interesting areas to explore than revisiting that.

  
Bob basically has another version of his same crisis from the first film: feeling underutilized and unappreciated, this time as a homemaker instead of an insurance guy. Though for different reasons, Violet is ignored by her crush yet again. And Dash doesn't really have any plot driving him, he's just there to help out the family. I'd rather see something like Bob finally getting to be a superhero but now that it's his day job, he doesn't love it anymore and how does he deal with that. Or Violet having to balance a relationship and her superhero duties, something like now she has the guy she finally wants, but can't keep him. And then Dash having to deal with sibling rivalry with Jack Jack, the fact that he isn't as special anymore with this multi-talented baby around and wants him gone. And then maybe Jack gets kidnapped, prompting each of them to realize that getting what you want won't make you happy, that it's the relationships that matter most.  


The villain could be spotted a mile away, although I would have preferred it if both the siblings were evil. Their plan would have made more sense, they instigate some sort of crime, a hero goes to save the day, the family TV cameras capture all the action, and Winston and Evelyn profit. I also thought that the siblings were the ones who were going to be responsible for their father's murder, but that was just a red herring. Also, it irked me that Bob, Helen and Frozone just trusted the siblings immediately after all they've been through. Yeah, they're blinded by their desperation to be heroes again, but it seems odd that not even Bob or Helen would question their motives despite Frozone saying he checked them out. ",8r7d6q

e12ohag,"I really enjoyed this movie, but it definitely isn't the classic the first one is. For me, I think the main issue is that the character arcs seem disjointed and aren't really resolved by the end of the film. 

Bob's arc (learning how to be a good dad to his kids) could've been great, but ended up really muddled throughout the film. He's in a completely new role, no longer the lead superhero nor the breadwinner. The first movie made him realize that he needs to be there for his family, which is great, but now what? He tries to help his kids with his usual forceful and strong-headed approach (which generally works for him as a superhero), but it doesn't quite work to solve his kids problems. He has to learn to have a more delicate and creative touch, one that doesn't leave so much collateral damage. In other words, he needs to learn how to approach these problems a bit more like his wife. That's what I think Pixar was aiming for, but then they leaned way too much on the ""Bob is jealous of his wife's success"" angle. Ultimately there wasn't really any moment of enlightenment for Bob at the end of the film. He has that one nice moment with Violet, but after that his issues were just kind of dropped once everyone started getting mind-controlled.

Helen's journey could've acted as an interesting parallel to Bob's if they had decided to make her uncomfortable with being the lead hero after 15 years of being on the sidelines (and not actually missing it all that much). As a mirror to Bob's role-reversal, it would've been interesting to see her struggle with being put in the spotlight while being so far away from the kids she's been raising for the past decade. There were moments of that in the beginning of the film, but after the sequence on the train, she's pretty much 100% on board with her new role and she doesn't waver from that for the rest of the film.

There have been hints in various Brad Bird interviews that suggest he bailed on his initial Incredibles 2 script after production had already started and had to rush to get a new version out. I don't think that's particularly unusual for a Pixar film (it seems to happen to a lot, if not all, of their movies), but it sounds like losing a year of production after the Toy Story 4 release date swap really hurt them in the end. I think this helps explain why the character arcs aren't nearly as neat as they are in the first movie, in addition to the relatively predictable plot and Pixar's overuse of the ""friendly character is actually the villain"" twist. It's too bad, because I think with just a bit more tightening up, this movie could've been really close to the excellence of the first one. But then again, I've only seen the movie once, so maybe I've missed a couple things.

As a side note, I think the new supers look weird because they're supposed to reflect how the superhero look has changed over the years. The heroes from the glory years (like Gazerbeam) are old school superheroes from the 40s and 50s, whereas Voyd and the others look much more like what you'd see in comics from the 60s onwards.

TL; DR: Incredibles 2 was really fun, but suffers from incomplete character arcs.",8r7d6q

e2kj3r1,Imo a better vilian for this movie would have been the dad of the real villain that supposedly died and watched his wife die and as a result hates supers. He could have been all disfigured due to a gunshot which is why he needed the mask. Pretty much everything could have been the same with the daughter working along side him reluctantly (kind of like mirage  at the end of the first one). At some point he acidently puts her in danger and she could be saved by elastagirl (or another member of the family) which causes him to change his mind on supers (could be a flash back of his dead wife) and  then he hates himself for what he's done which results in him sacrificing himself to stop his plan from harming others  ,8r7d6q

For everyone saying they were annoyed with the obvious villain, I think you‚Äôre thinking about it wrong. 


1) Part of the fun of watching these movies as adults is that we see and pick up on things that kids might not. Yes, I knew who the villain was pretty early on, but the little girl in front of me sure didn‚Äôt. At the end of the day (even though they still definitely catered to adults with certain scenes and jokes) this is a movie meant for kids, and Pixar couldn‚Äôt make a super-complicated twisty-turny plotline for fear of losing their target audience. Don‚Äôt be a neckbeard.


2) Even if it was obvious, it wasn‚Äôt a BAD reveal. Evelyn Devor (lolololol) was still a good villain. She was sketchy from the get-go. She had solid motives and a good plan, and she had me on the edge of my seat. The reveal itself shocked me, even though it was half-expected. Despite it being predictable, it was believable. I‚Äôd take that over them making a sweet, timid, ‚Äúangel walking among us‚Äù character and then suddenly turning them evil at the last minute. 


3) The thrill of a movie doesn‚Äôt lie in being able to point a finger at the bad guy, it‚Äôs following alongside the hero and trying to figure out how they‚Äôll save the day. It‚Äôs Pixar. We KNOW The Incredibles are gonna win in the end. But getting from Point A to Point B was a very stressful and exciting experience. I still found myself going ‚Äúokay wait how are they gonna get out of here‚Äù on more than one occasion.


I don‚Äôt think anyone was remotely surprised by Syndrome in the first movie, but we all still loved it. Don‚Äôt let the one ‚Äúmeh‚Äù element ruin a really good movie for you. 


As far as the rest of the movie goes, I LOVED the scenes with Bob and the kids. So many of the scenes felt authentic and realistic (even when they were playing with Jack-Jack‚Äôs new superpowers. That‚Äôs EXACTLY how my family would‚Äôve reacted lol.) I also really enjoyed the fighting scenes, mainly Violet and Void. I could‚Äôve watched that fight go on forever. The scenes with ScreenSlaver were intense. I‚Äôm 22 and I was a little freaked out. I‚Äôm really glad they gave the warnings about all of the flashing lights. I could see how the scene with Helen and the pizza guy fighting in the light-up room specifically could be really bad for anyone who‚Äôs sensitive to things like that. If you haven‚Äôt seen the movie yet (but are still reading spoiler-heavy reviews? I don‚Äôt know) and you think this might be an issue for you, be cautious! 


And EDNA. 


Pixar knew that we loved her and needed solid scenes with her and they DELIVERED. 


Overall, I loved every minute of this. Pixar did it again!!


Edit: also, the pacing was great, they made a feminist movie without it being like ‚ÄúwOw ShE‚Äôs A sUpEr AnD a WoMaN,‚Äù they showed off Violet‚Äôs powers super well, the scene with the raccoon was hilarious, and they did superheroes fighting superheroes better than Batman vs Superman k I‚Äôm done bye",8r7d6q
e1hbsvs,"So, I'll preface this by saying I really did like the movie.

I had two big issues with it, and one of them is a meta thing.

First, I felt like it was really predictable. I'll admit they threw me off a little because the first time Screen Slaver was introduced, I immediately thought it was Winston trying to create crisis' for Elastigirl to stop to boost her image (especially since DevTech is a telecommunications company). It wasn't until Evelyn reiterated that she was the inventor of the family and said that she could make a device to track Screen Slaver down that I realized it was her and not Winston.

And the meta issue... it really only became super apparent after seeing the coming attractions for animated movies like Wreck It Ralph 2 and Charming right before seeing this one. There's a recurring theme lately of the leading heroine being applauded by other characters for 'stepping out of the male lead's shadow' and doing things on their own while the former male lead is relegated to comic relief. Like, go ahead and make your movies have female leads, but I feel like having other characters have a deliberate discussion about gender roles sends the wrong message, especially to kids (IE, if you're a girl and you go to a man for help you're weak and can't stand on your own, so just do it yourself). Everyone needs help sometimes, you shouldn't be put down just because it happened to come from a man.

Edit: I'm going to add Mr. Incredible burning his finger on a waffle iron. Dude's invulnerable but he can't handle a minor burn for a second?",8r7d6q
e1vcj6w,"Honestly, I thought it was alright. Not great, but not bad either. The villain could've been done a bit better. She's no Syndrome, that's for sure lol.

It's sad to say though, despite it being a ""alright"" movie... it wasn't THAT memorable. I just watched it an hour ago while typing this and I'm trying to recap myself on what's happened to discuss about.

The villain really could've been better. When I first saw her and heard her line I thought in my head... ""Could she be the villain? Nah, that's too easy"" and then she was. She had decent reasonings on being a villain, but they were kind of meh for the most part. I kind of wish she died...

This was a heated topic for my friend and I cause he disagrees, saying it was good that she lived cause there's a possibility for her to return. That if she died, the series would've had a ""Villain of the week"" type with each movie. / The thing is, it took them 14 years to make a second movie, I don't think there's going to be a ""Villain of the week"" scenario. I would've liked her to die cauuse, well Syndrome died and the movie always showed that life isn't fair and there are risks. People die. That's why when Elastigirl fired a flare at her to send her flying out from a JET! It was shocking, but satisfying that she ""died"" like that... until it shows her still falling from the sky and Elastigirl saving her. It's suppose to show a Hero trying to save everyone, even the villain and I would've been alright with that, but she was still fighting back... and I wished that she died cause of that. Hating supers so much that she refuses to be saved by one and not become like... a Batman villain who's just waiting in prison to just rehash her evil plans on the city.",8r7d6q

e0rexnq,"Seriously, Jack-Jack has finally gotten the role he needed, after he's almost been neglected in the first movie, and the rest of the movie is cool to perfection. Violet and Dash plays a major role in helping Mr. Incredible and Elastic-girl who got into trouble. 

With that said, the villain in the movie is weak compared to the first one because the vast majority of the movie is superheroes fighting a couple of superheroes who happened to be brainwashed by a manipulating, non-superhuman woman who simply thought supers are a threat to humanity. The ""Screensaver"" who is thought to be hyped up as a main villain only turned out to be just a civilian who was brainwashed by Evelyn so as to get rid of Supers and to unwillingly place other people in a hypnotic trance on her behalf so no suspicion would be placed on her. 

I feel the motivation in the movie isn't strong enough compared to the first movie, where Syndrome has a twisted definition of a ""superhero"" simply because of what Bob Parr said to him. Also, Underminer has a LOT of potential there to be a true villain, but he's simply a minor character like Bomb Voyage is.

It was obvious as day that the superhero loving rich dude was the villain. I was just waiting for his reveal, but it turned out to be his sister. At least I gotta commend the movie for not being THAT easy to read. 

I felt like the screenslaver concept could've been focused on more. I really like the character at first. If he was left as a separate entity and was the final villain of the movie, I felt like it would've been fantastic (if he was written as well as mysterious he seemed to be at first). 

The movie had a number of flaws, true. But from a fan-service perspective, it did a very good job! I laughed a lot and enjoyed it very much. Seeing the father trying to raise his kids was super nice to watch, and so was jack-jack's development. I have a feeling that if they do a 3rd movie (which I feel like they would) it would be focusing on a slightly older jack-jack, seeing as to how he was pretty much the focus of the film for a good portion of it.

As a big fan of the original Incredibles I was pretty prepared for this to be not as good as the original. It wasnt, but oh my goodness, it was sooooooo much fun! Humour was spot on, action scenes were on point, visuals were bright and vibrant. Im kind of glad I went to a screening with children because it was great to see them have as much fun as I did in the early 2000s. My criticisms are that it lacked the same striking aesthetic as the oringal. The Incredibles had the great blend between that dull, monochrome visuals of ordinary life and the vibrance of the supers which isn't as pronounced in this film. Maybe its my fault for expecting the film to look just like one from 2003. The art deco style and music were also more subdued. The themes weren't as heavy this time either.

Overall still a fantastic, if more conventional, animated film

The short, Bao, was fantastic. I was horrified when she ate her boy, it was such a rollercoaster

e0z8rmo,"I thought this was really good overall, but not as good as the original. Here's what I liked and didn't like about the film.

Things I liked

1. The animation is stunning.
2. This might have the best Giacchino score ever.
3. The voice acting was really good.
4. The opening with the Underminer was incredible.
5. I loved that the Incredimobile came back.
6. Violet's powers are put to much better use than in the first movie.
7. Overall, this was just a really fun movie.

Things I didn't like

1. Evelyn Deavorz is not a good villain. She is too similar to Syndrome (both want to destroy all superheroes because superheroes failed them due to misplaced trust in the past). She is a twist villain, which I'm really getting tired of. And she's not just a twist villain. She's an obvious twist villain. Her name is basically Evil Endeavor. Of course she's the bad guy!
2. If the public perception of superheroes could be changed completely in a couple of weeks, the public really hadn't turned on superheroes at all.
3. The animation on the new superheroes was subparr.
4. Honey and Edna were both less awesome than in the original.
5. The movie was too lighthearted. It is easily the happiest movie Pixar has ever made. What makes Pixar great is its ability to blend sadness and entertainment at the same time. They can make a movie about a cowboy losing his place in the world to modernity and having to escape a serial killer, a movie about a father having to find his son after he was kidnapped by an otherworldly abomination, a movie about a family of superheroes fighting for their lives in the aftermath of a superhero genocide, a post-apocalyptic sci-fi movie, a movie about depression, and a movie about the afterlife, death, and alzheimers entertaining. Even their lighter movies, like Monsters Inc., Ratatouille, and Up have a lot of hidden darkness in them. This had no more darkness than a normal superhero movie does.

Overall, this is probably one of the better superhero movies ever made just because of the technical achievements alone, but it still falls way short of the original.",8r7d6q
e14osdw,"Overall, the movie was neat but not as good as I hoped.

First of all, I loved Bob's plotline about family and being a good dad. I thought it was really well done and enjoyed every minute of it, especially the hilariously cringe-worthy moments with Violet lol

Second of all, I really enjoyed the action sequences and thought they were really exciting and engaging. The score was also super cool and definitely made the action that much more exhilarating.

However, I was ultimately disappointed with Helen's plotline. [It was painfully obvious who the true villain was because Evelyn was almost always depicted with dark imagery/literally in the shadows and whatnot. A friend of mine also pointed out how very early on she even mentions that she was really bitter about her father's tragedy unlike her brother or something, which was an immediate tell for her.](#spoiler) 

I also thought Screenslaver [and Evelyn](#spoiler) were underwhelming villains. I know Screenslaver was just a ruse, but his criticisms about society weren't properly thematically set-up and thus felt out of place. Neither did I agree with what he had to say. ""You guys don't talk, you watch talk shows. You don't play games, you watch game shows."" Who is supposed to apply to? The diegetic quasi 1960's world, or our IRL world? In either case, I think he's grossly misinformed.

[Evelyn was also really ""meh"". I agree with some of the other comments where her motive of keeping supers illegal could have been done in a much less roundabout way. Syndrome was really cool bc you understand where he's coming from, and you kind of agree with him but he's going about it the wrong way. Whereas with Evelyn, I didn't empathize with her all that much, and the execution of her plan was predictable and uninspired.](#spoiler)

The movie was also surprisingly dialogue-heavy, especially with the scenes between Helen and Evelyn. I tuned out during their lengthy conversations about idealism and cynicism, they felt really blatant and out of place.

The movie was a fun ride and I was glad to see it, but I wouldn't chalk it up amongst Pixar's greatest achievements.

One last thing that bothered me, [they never caught the Underminer! I know there's the video game, but after 14 years I was expecting them to finally defeat him, but he gets away and never comes back. At the very least, I was hoping that he would show up in the end credits and they'd finally resolve it there.](#spoiler)",8r7d6q

e0q31do,"This movie had some of the best superhero fights I've seen. Every power was used in clever ways and I didn't feel like any potential was wasted.

The jokes were solid and the plot dealt with interesting and complex themes which some children might not fully understand, but it wasn't to the point that they would be lost or unable to enjoy the movie.

**\[SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT\]**

Like I said above, the fight scenes were amazing. Genuinely better than any I've seen from Marvel (or DC but is that a surprise to anyone?). Each character had a unique and interesting fighting style and we got to see them mixed and matched.

My top 3 favourite fights were:

*-Elastagirl vs Screenslaver*

You know the one I'm talking about. The flashing lights and tiny space, followed by a chase and an explosion. Very visually stunning and exciting.

*-Elastagirl vs Void*

Void's powers had a lot of potential to be used in creative ways and none of it was squandered. From throwing characters around to making them punch themselves, it did not disappoint.

*-Violet vs Void*

When she used her portal to get into Violet's forcefield... so good!

I only have a few minor gripes with this film. The first has been mentioned by pretty much every adult who has seen it: the villain reveal. It doesn't really take away from the movie but it also doesn't add anything.

~~My second minor gripe is that Screenslaver's monologue about people's obsessions with screens was a little hamfisted and honestly not even that great of a monologue for what it was. Her motivations turned out not to revolve around getting people away from screens though so not much time was wasted on this.~~ (edit: as u/bitwize pointed out below, this speech was probably meant for the 1960's characters, and not the present day audience. This paired with the fact that it didn't turn out to be a plot point makes it a nice little detail. Adding 0.1 to my final score for this.)

Then is the fact that the kids didn't catch on to the mind control thing at all. When Void tried pushing the goggles onto Violet's face and Violet urgently pushed them away, it seemed like she should at least think something is up with them, but she doesn't catch on even when she sees her parents and Frozone wearing them and acting strange / hostile.

All in all, this movie is fuckin' great. Do yourself a favour and see it in theaters.

e1aqn52,"All the scenes are good to great on their own, but after letting it settle for a day, it doesn't quite work as a whole.

Screenslaver is no Syndrome, and I think the broad plot was less exciting. Syndrome wanted to rob Supers of their privileges as powerful individuals because he felt everyone/no one deserved them. Screenslaver wants to, uhh, make Supers legal again in order to make them illegal again? They already are, and the momentum for ratifying the Accords doesn't start until the Deavors  recruit the Incredibles and Frozone.

Now its a fair point that Winston would have done it anyway and Evelyn found the best strategy to derail his plans, but it still wasn't as interesting or relatable. 

Also, I'm not really sure what the ""message"" or ""point"" of this one was versus the original. First movie has obvious themes about family, identity, privilege and revenge/jealousy. This movie is kind of continuing the theme of family, but the opening scene against the Underminer sort of undercuts the punch of the final shot of the first movie. And while Bob's arc with the kids was compelling, it was paced out very strangely. Most out of place was the scene where Bob figures out Dash's homework, and things seem to be turning around based on the events and musical cues...and then its right back to sleep deprivation and imcompetence.

The movie is still really entertaining, wonderfully animated, at multiple points laugh-out-loud funny, and a fun follow up with some great characters. But Incredibles 2 also serves to prove what an absolute masterpiece the original was, and I don't think the sequel will hold up the way its predecessor has and will. ",8r7d6q
e1fvwig,"Things i loved:

- Not new, but I like how the powers are metaphorical/allegorical. --Violet is a shrinking Violet, hence why her abilities are invisibility and force fields. --Dash is a hyperactive preteen boy. 
--Elastigirl is emotionally flexible (and women are often more literally physically flexible than men). --Mr. Incredible is strong and durable, stable and reliable physically and emotionally. --Many of Jack Jack's powers are jokes about babies/young children (can suddenly become demonic, can suddenly seem to disappear on you, can seem to be many places at once/all over the place, can have freakishly strong sneezes, can seem freakishly strong for their size, can be physically pliable/flexible/resilient, grow quickly, etc). The fact that Jack-Jack has many powers also references how babies have huge potential.

- The villain and the main protagonist (Elastigirl and Evelyn) are both women, but that fact didn't feel forced.

- I like that Winston seems genuinely nice, unlike a lot of real-life counterparts

Things I didn't love:

- The superheros from around the world (Reflux, Brick, crush guy, owl guy, euro guy, etc.) have extreme body shapes and accents. The least stylized is Void, who has an american accent. The main characters however have more normal body proportions. I felt like this dehumanized the foreign supers somewhat, which made me a little uncomfortable.

- As soon as the villain was shown to be adept at technology, it was pretty clear that the sister was behind it (also heavily forshadowed by her comments like ""I'm the genius behind the genius"" when discussing her role in her company). The only question was whether she and her brother were working together, and whether it was to help elastigirl's image (by providing a big villain she could defeat) or to destroy her image. I wish that the sister had less of a classic villain role but still provided antagonism.

* Neither film addresses the Achilles heel of the world they create - **what about super villains?** It's all fine and good to make supers illegal, but it's not going to make the super villains simply go away.

Syndrome represents toxic fandom taken to its extreme (I am your number one fan, and if I can't control you, I will destroy you) and Voyd represents the nicest most wholesome fan who's just grateful their hero exists and lets her see herself in a positive aspirational light instead of having to hide who she is. 

(Voice actor Sophia Bush ~~is gay~~ and said in interviews she brought that subtext to Voyd)

also they both use blue weird energy and have iconic hair. It continues the theme of the film pulling a ton of reversals from the first movie including having Helen be the hero instead of Bob, making the monologuey white dude not the villain, dash learning responsibility and violet learning to stand up for herself, frozone being the instigator instead of reluctant enabler, and all the new supers being unconventional instead of blond blue eyed gods",8r7d6q

e0sy0c5,"The movie was perfect! The animation was on point without a doubt, and the characters were extremely fun. They captured that family dynamic perfectly (as if that was ever gonna be a struggle for Pixar) and seeing more of it just felt right. 

Watching this one really made me realize we didn't see as much action in the first one. This one cranked it up to 11! When Mrs. Incredible detached that motorcycle inside the train, my jaw dropped! It was just so much fun! 

I kinda saw the villain twist coming, but I couldn't tell which one of the siblings would turn. Was Screenslaver the brother's idea as a catalyst for superheroes to return or would the sister do it cause she felt them unnecessary (which is pretty much how it went down)

I can't think of a flaw really besides wanting more of Dash.

The music was amazing as always, the action was dynamic as hell, and 
it was one of the more fun experiences I've had at the movies. 10/10",8r7d6q
e0t121o,"I'd give it an 8 out of 10. Really great on all accounts of the Incredibles family, action, comedy, and that wonderful score. It isn't a perfect like the first one so it's not at the expectations, but I'd still recommend it. The problems come from the villains and the moral debate about superheroes really doesn't come off that strong. 

The Underminer kind of...undermines the purpose of the superhero debate in the movie. Other than the main supervillains who use their tech to be incredibly evil, all the other crime that is street-level stuff or rescue missions. You can't tell me that the police have the ability to stop the Underminer and that ""insurance"" is going to handle that problem and ""doing nothing"" was the wrong idea. This is double-downed by the fact that he actually succeeds in getting the money and escaping. 

The villains were way too obvious and the whole Randian philosophy that comes from them feels very forced. It feels like they are trying to cram in a message about the present (people addicted to screens and weak) in the past and it doesn't really work. No one actually appears addicted to media in any form in this film. So the ""debates"" that occur feel rather flimsy because they don't really go anywhere. Syndrome was great because all of his hatred was better shown through his character shift rather than how it's told here. 

3. Minor nitpick, but did anyone else think the animation for some reason made Mr. Incredible and Violet look much older? The movie seems to take place right after the first one and Bob has these gigantic wrinkles around his face (even before taking care of the kids). Violet has these circles under her eyes too that just make her eyes in general look pretty big. 

Everything else I enjoyed a lot and thought it atleast paid off to be an enjoyable movie. But I would definitely say it isn't the best of superhero movies we've had lately. 

Now Bao on the other hand? Holy shit, that might be my favorite Pixar short ever. So beautiful, so funny and really got great reactions from my audience. That's such a tender little story about family and growth that worked as a companion piece to this. Please give Domee Shi a fucking movie. 10/10.",8r7d6q
e0t1zk0,"Let me start off by saying Bao was amazing. I teared up.

So what did The Incredibles 2 do very well? Man, the score was pretty good. I don't think it was perfect, but it made scenes very heavy when it needed to be. The animations were on point. You can tell that the animation team went above and beyond. For example, when Mr. Incredible was sitting down with Edna to review JackJack's powers, his leg hit the corner of the table and it hurt him and you see him grunt in pain and massage the area. That is something that was completely unnecessary to do, but they did it to make it realistic and it was super believable. I enjoyed the humor. I understand the gripes that some of the humor was portrayed in the trailers, and that's a valid complaint. But as a whole, if you didn't watch the trailers, I really think the humor was on point. I laughed. I think there were good concepts explored, but maybe not to their fullest potential. Soccer dads, working moms. Kids are hard, but worth it. Everything you see now is a screen in front of you trying to brainwash you.

What are my issues with The Incredibles 2? It didn't do anything *new*. First, powers wise, the additions to abilities was an expansion of Violet's powers, Elastigirl's new Elastibike (the disconnect/reconnect launch thing), and JackJack. We added a few new heroes to the pack, but their powers were really explored. They were just there, just like all those people that Syndrome shut down in the first movie. I wanted *more*, but all we got was Elastigirl parachuting everywhere, which was super cool in the first movie, but now she's just doing it everywhere. 

Regarding JackJack, I really feel that what we knew in the first movie for his powers was 2&#37;. Now we're at like 10&#37;. It's still pretty unexplored territory, and by making him super overpowered, he's probably going to see himself come the villain if we get to Incredibles 5 or we're never going to get that far.

Violet is my favorite character from this series, but my biggest grievance with Disney Pixar with Violet is... WHY WON'T THEY GIVE THE DAMN GIRL A DATE ALREADY? We waited more than decade and her date progress moved from ""date set"" to ""almost arrived at date"". If we get another movie, the movie theater they were about to go will probably be destroyed and her date status will inch along another 3&#37; by the end of the next movie...

Regarding our villain, I have no issues with the twist being slightly predictable because I think we've all grown a little cynical and on the lookout because that's how movies are these days. If it was actually a completely random character, people here will be saying ""Oh, they didn't develop this character at all, yada yada yada..."" Granted, we didn't get to develop our villain this time around much either, but I think the point is that she's supposed to be a complete stranger that we thought we knew and could get along with. We saw her from Elastigirl's point of view, and I have no issues with that. My issue with the villain, however, was that it wasn't climactic. For those that know the reference, she's the Mandarin from Iron Man 3. That's how the movie played out, and I'm sure there were very few people impressed with how the Mandarin was portrayed in Iron Man 3...

What did they do in this movie? We didn't learn more about Edna or Frozone. They wrote out our government Men in Black person from the movie (I kinda really liked him...). The Parr family was happy before the movie and now they're happy after the movie. Violet still hasn't had her date. Dash hasn't ran another track meet or tried out other sports. No new supers were developed to their potential. The Underminer is still loose. Like what did we gain other than a rehash of the first? This is what separates average sequels with stellar sequels, not repeating what you just did in the first movie. Or maybe they're just trying to get us hooked for the third movie...? Hmm...",8r7d6q

e0v2vs1,"As someone mentioned the opening scene should‚Äôve been Winstons and Evelyn‚Äôs parents being shot. Not some kid getting Men in Black‚Äôd. That would‚Äôve made us empathize more with Evelyn‚Äôs and her dislike for superheroes. I personally liked her motives for doing what she did, but it did come as a bit...meh. Again her message was great and honestly ScreenSlavers monologue as Elastigirl was tracking him gave me shivers. Easily one of the best villain monologues in awhile. However, as everyone keeps pointing out, the execution was just meh. 

Another scene I would‚Äôve liked if they added: Winston confronting Evelyn. Winston was a great character but i was upset that the only scene he got to be a hero in was when he jumped out of the plane. I wanted him to confront Evelyn. It woulda been great if he finds out about her plan and then tries to stop it. Thus forcing Evelyn to put the goggles on him, her own brother. It would‚Äôve added another layer to how far she was willing to go. Syndrome was great because he was willing to sacrifice his assistant (wife?), whatever Mirage was, for his goal. He was also willing to hurt children. I didn‚Äôt feel like Evelyn was ever an actual threat. 

I never felt like the family was ever in any ‚Äúreal‚Äù danger. In the first one, Helen has to actually sit the kids down and tell them that these people WILL kill them. I never got that from this movie. That‚Äôs why if there was a scene of Evelyn putting the goggles on her brother it would have been great because then she‚Äôd be at Syndromes level. 

Another issue i had was that i did not care for Bob‚Äôs story and him trying to be the Dad. I honestly found myself being annoyed when the scenes switched from Helen‚Äôs adventure to Bob helping Dash with math homework. It was just so uninteresting in comparison. 

So my gripes were Bobs plot wasn‚Äôt interesting and the villains arc execution sucked. Again decent villain, but without the stakes of the first one, this movie just doesn‚Äôt compare. That said, i sorta knew it wouldn‚Äôt and as a stand-alone i think this movie is enjoyable. 

Definitely a great family film. I saw with mine and it had something for everyone. Jack-jack is adorable. That whole scene with Edna mode had me dying. She steals any scene she‚Äôs in. The fights were cool, just like Frozone. Honestly his character was awesome as usual, and i liked seeing him helping Bob babysit. It made me appreciate their friendship. There are a couple scenes here that boarder fan service (Elastigirl in a bath robe). And honestly when Screenslaver shows up, he definitely gives off heavy Amon vibes (for any Legend of Korra fans).

Overall as it‚Äôs own movie i‚Äôd give it about a 7/10. Solid, but i don‚Äôt feel it has any replay value to me personally which really hurts it. ",8r7d6q

e2bwklq,"I was actually pretty disappointed with this movie overall, which is such a shame, because the first movie is one of my all time favourites.  I liked parts, and the animation was incredible, but it just felt quite forgettable to me. I‚Äôve seen the first countless times, and it‚Äôs never gotten old, whereas I don‚Äôt find myself wanting to rewatch this one.

Things I disliked:

‚Ä¢ The villain arc was pretty terrible (and predictable). It‚Äôs a hard ask to top Syndrome, sure, but from the get go it felt awful. The ‚Äòscreenslaver‚Äô was such a good idea, and the mask, and the control goggles, were both genuinely freaky. But everything else about it fell pretty flat. Which is a shame, as it‚Äôs obviously a large chunk of the movie.
‚Ä¢ The new supers didn‚Äôt sit right with me either. Partly because they were so...bright? Especially Void. The bright green of her hair, against a previously quite muted and golden and red palette...they just stuck out like a sore thumb to me, and it felt awkward every time they showed up. 
‚Ä¢I know Bob tried to be happy for Helen, but the whole jealously thing was pretty blah from the get go
‚Ä¢ I would of loved to of seen just a bit more of Edna 


Things I liked:

‚Ä¢ Violet! She remains my favourite character, along with Dash. I find them far more interesting than Helen and Bob. I was glad when they had more of a chance to shine in the third act. 
‚Ä¢ Edna‚Äôs scenes with Jack Jack
‚Ä¢The score by Micheal Giacchino remains well...incredible 
‚Ä¢The animation was great! I was marvelling over the detail that was put into a painted wall at one point. 
‚Ä¢ Again, the goggles - the scenes when the supers all had them on were well done, and it felt quite disturbing to see them all zoned out and mind controlled in that way
‚Ä¢ The fight between Mind controlled Elastigirl and Mr.Incredible was also pretty well done
‚Ä¢ While some of the humour fell pretty flat, there was some great comedic moments - mostly brought by Dash, Edna and Frozone
‚Ä¢ Jack Jack vs Raccoon was also pretty great

Highlights:   
-love the change of dynamic between mr and mrs incredible, its kinda cheesy that they just flipped the roles from the first film but it was great because her powers were waaaay more visually interesting and creative. And we got some good comedy out of the stay at home dad antics.  
-That train chase scene was the Best Part holyshit. It was super fun seeing her split herself with the bike and do all kinds of cool stuff.  
-I thought jackjack's powers would get boring but they kept on adding more and more and it was all hilarious. Raccoon fight plus Edna babysitting was great.  

Small nitpicks:  
-kinda lame to have another predictable villain twist but the power of mass mind control was cool and scary  
-also kinda lame that they basically stop 3 Giant things from hitting other Things lol. Underminer drill, Big boat, runaway train. I wish the final action piece was the full family versus the enemy Supers in a bigger space than inside a boat.  Void vs Violet was still really cool.

e2gapfa,"There are several plot holes in incredibles 2 that are bothering me.

1. Why did Elastigirl figure out how to fight again so quickly? (I guess this goes back to the first movie too) It took an intense montage for Mr. Incredible to get back in shape. Is Elastigirl in some intense training in her free time? Is it just like riding a bike?
   1. After getting responses to this I can see that Elastigirl's powers are less based on physique and more on her molecular redistribution. Nevertheless, I think that driving the Elasticycle like she did after being a mom for 10 plus years with little to no practice that we know of is unlikely. She had difficulty on the bike for a second but because it was electric not the fact that it was a bike and I think there was not enough time to learn it more.
2. Why didn't Dicker (the government guy) tell the Incredibles about Jack-Jack's powers when he memory wiped Carrie the babysitter when she saw his powers first manifest? We see this hilarity in the short Jack-Jack Attack? For that matter why didn't they think their baby could have powers after seeing their baby ignite when Syndrome was taking him? It is pretty easy to see something burst into flame even from far away.
3. Why did Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl say their children's names in public? It was shown that secret identities were important in the very first scene in Incredibles 1 (the old footage part). The reason, supposedly, that they were making sacrifices was for their kids' future. What sort of future will they have if they are always referred to by their first names instead of having superhero names? (especially if being super is still illegal) It bothered me so much when they were fighting with people or in public everytime they said ""take care of Jack-Jack"", ""Violet do this"", ""Dash can't talk right now"". Someone at some point would have heard them (police, bystanders, or even worse, bad guys). They are very careful to not say Luscious's name in public and always say ""Frozone"" so for the characters it does not match up in my opinion.
4. Why did they have their super suits with them at the track meet if supers were still illegal? I always saw the last scene in Incredibles 1 as them not having to be underground anymore. Also Dash was wearing a track uniform with shorts, where would he have his super tights hidden under? The chronology doesn't make sense so this should have been the end of the movie if it was no longer illegal to be supers. (Could be a funny short, doing superhero laundry getting ready for the track meet and going out)
5. The hypnosis rules were odd. They seemed to be told what to do every moment but at the same time do some pretty bizarre and specific things of their own accord. Were they only sometimes directly controlled or were they programmed to finish a task? Did they have some free will on how to do so or to do this task to their best of their abilities (kind of like Killgrave)? Since it was technology based control and not magic I find it harder to believe that they are thralls. Technology has a much more limited scope than magic does. I think of it as computer programming, the computer will only do what you have programmed or have told it to do. In the end I would have liked more explanation of how the hypno-goggles worked. The second time we see the hypnosis the anchorman guy seems to be saying what he is told to and I thought of the control like that for the rest of the movie.

PS Loved the movie and I guess this is what happens when you have 14 years between movies lol, you forget about little things.Ôªø

Still pretty new to reddit and I am not sure the proper format but hope you like. It has been so hot where I live I have been going on my own to see movies and wanted to discuss it with people.

I tried posting this to [r/movies](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies) the first time but got flagged since it is too soon after release. I reposted to [r/plotholes](https://www.reddit.com/r/plotholes) and now I look forward to hearing your opinions moviegoers! Lol, I just posted this in r/movies again by accident. This is what the moderators meant, put it in the official discussion! Lol. Hope you read and enjoy.

e0set4r,"I really loved it. I loved that the powers were used so creatively - The Elastigirl bike, the Voyd using her portals cleverly, Violet doing that force missile to smash the rock, and everything else. Screensaver villain was cool too.

And man the movie was so gorgeous. I watched the original last night and the old animation was showing.",8r7d6q
e0ytnca,"I don't care if we have to kidnap Brad Bird and make him write it at gunpoint, I refuse to wait 14+ years for another Incredibles movie. ",8r7d6q
e0p3jua,"It‚Äôs funny, sitting in the theater and watching the film as it went on, I kept thinking in my brain it‚Äôs just not as good as the first, but it‚Äôs still pretty serviceable and fun nonetheless. But after the entire final ‚ÄúSave the City‚Äù sequence, there was a father and child sitting two rows in front of me, and as the scene ended, the son just simply said, ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù, and my theater laughed for a good second. 

And then, as I got out of the theater, I realized that there is a whole new generation of kids that are experiencing this franchise like we did 14 years ago (hell, I saw the first film when I was just a kid in theaters with my dad, who‚Äôs not the biggest fan of going to the theater, and it‚Äôs a fond memory we have).

So to jump ahead to now and to see and hear that moment, made me smile. Brad Bird has always known that at the core of this film, it is about family, and it shows and then-some. Yes, this film has its flaws, but I can‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt have fun with it and I can say that it is definitely worth my admission. üòä",8r7d6q
e0pv6mq,def the best display of power usage on the big screen,8r7d6q
e0qad95,"It's fantastic, didn't think it could live up to my expectation but it did. A nice surprise. I'd love a bit more fighting in the last act but consider the runtime, i think it's good enough. I smiled and grinned my way through the whole thing. It's damn good fun, probably gonna see it again.

Visual's very beautiful while remaining loyal to the art style of the original. It's the best as it coulda been.

Soundtrack is nice, but probably not good enough to listen to on its own.

Watching Elastigirl saving the train makes me realize how much potential Fantastic 4 has as far as movie/animated feature goes, shame that it hasn't got a proper movie up to date.",8r7d6q
e0rbrm8,14 years and the Underminer still hasn't been brought to justice.,8r7d6q
e0v8djg,"All things considered. Im glad it is a movie, even if its a hair shallower than I would have liked. A bit of retreading from the first movie and... lets be fair... a weaker (character/storywise) villain.

That being said. I enjoyed it. Alot of fun little character moments and opening it up with more superpower fights in the movie were interesting to watch. Good humor as well, had me laughing at a few points here and there.

I will say, cash grab or not, Im glad we got to revisit this universe, even if it was played safe in some parts. I wouldnt mind a threequel, as long as I dont have to wait another 15 years.

Id also agree with some others that have mentioned... this would make a great universe for a tv show. Tell lots of good small stories framed in the Super Hero 60's.

EDIT: Remembered a funny theater moment. Pretty full at 10PM they were doing that opening ""Thank you for being patient, this will have been worth the wait"" bit and some guy audibly said ""...it better be..."" and there were laughs to be had.",8r7d6q
e11pld1,"The pacing of the movie really suffered because they threw *everything* they had into the movie. Frankly, a lot of the scenes should have been on the DVD's deleted scenes reel.

My theater really liked the raccoon scene/diner scene/etc., but I think they made the movie feel too episodic, like a comfy 90s sitcom.",8r7d6q
e171erj,"It was definitely worth the wait, while I wouldn't say it was better than the original it came close. Good voice acting throughout the film, thought Dash's new voice actor would sound annoying from the trailer but he wasn't. Nice to see all the characters in a more modern animated style, re watched the first movie and I couldn‚Äôt help but notice how some stuff looked a little rough but then again it was from 2004.

Villain wasn't as fleshed out as syndrome was because it felt less directly connected to the Parr family but I could understand their motivation in why they were doing it.

Helen was a great character didn‚Äôt have any problems with her, she had some great scenes (The whole train sequence and the fight with the screen slaver in that box).

Bob kinda felt like a jerk though when Helen was giving the opportunity to resume hero work, its like he wanted her to turn it down so that he could do it himself or that it felt like he didn‚Äôt have any faith that she could actually do it but other than that he was a good character, staying up later the help dash with his homework. Did like that they stayed away from the trope of the dad being so protective of his daughter when she finally shows interest in boys and instead helped her. 

Jack jack is a power house now with all those powers, thought they would just expand more on his powers shown in the first movie and short, didn't expect them give him even more. Its not a bad thing but I feel like there giving him to much power, although Edna did state the he might lose some when he gets older. I did really enjoy his fight scene with the raccoon.

Violet had some pretty funny scenes (the ice cream one and the restaurant were hilarious). One thing that was never explained or used later was her ability to throw her barriers? she used it while fighting the underminer but she never used it again in the movie.

Didn't like what they did with the underminer, we waited 14 years to find out that he just wanted to rob a bank? with the speech he gave in the first movie I thought he wanted to drag the entire city underground with him or do something more interesting. Was also disappointed that he wasn't caught in the end, I know he wasn't the main villain but this is just another loose end.

Not sure why but I feel that the other supers in the movie looked somewhat low quality, I know there not the focus of the film but they kinda looked cheap, my guess it was that there suits are homemade unlike the Parr family‚Äôs and Frozone which are made by Edna. (Although Helen‚Äôs new suit was made by someone else cant remember the name)

Hoping that if a third movie is made it doesn't take so long to come out but of course I would rather wait awhile and have a good story than something that gets rushed out quickly.",8r7d6q
e19lm9s,"Not sure if anyone has said this yet but I really love how they show the Parr family's dedication to the team in some relatively subtle ways.  Like how Elastigirl changes her suit and thus her identity from being ""Elastigirl"", an individual crime fighter, to ""Mrs Incredible"", part of the team, for the final fight scene.  And also how Mr. Incredible repaints his ""Incredibile"" from a car that only represents himself to something that represents his whole family, as well as adding seats so that everyone could fit in.",8r7d6q
e2dqset,Disney May be an evil empire but they‚Äôre still talented enough to make a sequel to a 14 year old movie that‚Äôs actually good,8r7d6q
e8b70ch,"I would give Incredibles 2 a 7/10

What I liked: Great actions sequences and choreography, stellar soundtrack, Violet's growth, most of the humor (though some jokes fell flat), and the first act of the villain Screenslaver).  I also liked that the writers didn't forget about the family aspect (such as Helen getting the call about the new job offer, but the writers take time to show that she's concerned about her family, discussing how it may not be the right time).

The worst part of the movie?  Easily act three, and that's mainly because once the villain pulls the curtain backs, they become uninteresting.  The motivations for the villain are just weak, and they don't make much sense in the larger scope of things.  And once the climax came, it just felt like a rush to the finish.

Pixar has made villains like Syndrome and Lotso, so I expected much more from Screenslaver.  What a letdown of a villain.  Overall, a decent movie that could have been much better with a more well-grounded villain.",8r7d6q
e0qci7k,It all felt really... anti climatic. I kept waiting for a resounding punch or one more curveball and they never delivered. All and all it was enjoyable though.,8r7d6q
e0r3u90,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's funny, exciting, there's great direction and action and it's visually stunning.

At the same time, I'm really conflicted. I'll have to see it a second time but on first glance the narrative is much weaker than the first and the villain was really mixed for me. Her plan was great but her motives were much weaker compared to Syndrome.

If the first movie is a 10, on first watch this is like an 8 or an 8.5. Really, really great stuff but I can't get over the weaker narrative right now.",8r7d6q
e0vt9y6,3 days later and that villian monologue from Screenslaver still gives me chills. I must have the transcript!,8r7d6q
e172itb,"Amazing movie. Everyone has given a lot of praise and I agree with most of them so I will give a few nitpicks:

- No conclusion for the underminer. He got away with the money.

- i don't know how to express this but the ending's climax wasn't high enough? The build up was decent but the solution (how they took out screenslaver and saved the ship) wasn't dramatic enough. So it's a big anti-climatic for me.",8r7d6q
e0s314p,"The main villain was waaaaaay too obvious and it really ruined a-lot of the momentum. Like we're seriously supposed to think that elasti-girl didn't put two and two togther until the very end??? Telecom company who controls most screens in country ----> villain who hypnotises through all screens in country. Also she never bothered to question the pizza guy or the police never looked at the very suspicious mask???

Also near the end when the kids came to save them they defeat like 3 of the hypnotized superheroes but don't even think for one second to take off their masks??? Violet could have easily used her invisibility powers or dash his speed to do that real quick. (maybe that could be explained by them just being children but in the previous action scenes they were shown to be extremely competent superheroes)

Lastly the thing that bugged me was that the whole movie they hype up jack-jack and do stuff with him but at the very end they completely drop the ball and just do everything themselves instead of actually using his powers like they trained to do 

Overall it was a fun action flick but there were numerous plot-holes in the story. (like the whole boat arc was completely un-necesssary to the sisters plan)

edit: one more thing was that nobody dies like in the first film - what happened to the seriousness and the real consequences of being super? (elasti-girl does mention no casualties this time but it's pretty off-hand)",8r7d6q
e0y1qid,"The movie was very good. I grew up with the original, and I thought that this new one was quality, but just copied the original and didn't have much else to say on it's own. There is little to no character development.

I can't really think of a major emotional moment anywhere in the film. They were littered through the first one, which is why it is regarded as a classic. It offers so many great metaphors.

The main villain Syndrome, is partially a creation of Mr. Incredible. While he isn't responsible, his interactions with Bucky ultimately influenced his hatred of supers. This was the archetypal ""Don't meet your heroes"" situation. It made him snap and become a destructive force for everyone. This applies to fanaticism and all the hurtful things people can do to others because, ""their childhood was ruined"".

For a portion, Mrs. Incredible thought that her husband was cheating on her. And he kind of was. Not with another woman, but his old life. It's not bad that he missed it, but the lack of communication there almost literally destroyed the family. It rocked them, and it doesn't make sense to me that they would go right into basically the same situation, but with Elastigirl instead. 

Again with Mr. Incredible. He missed his old life, and it really wasn't that much about saving people. It was the thrill. What Syndrome had him doing was not saving people, but testing out his strength. Being a superhero was a selfish thing for Bob, and it was hard for him to realize that. He lied to his family and almost lost everything he cared about. That scene where they are all trapped still hits me today because you can really see him opening up and admitting his faults. 

Then there is that scene where Helen breaks down the villains in the Saturday morning cartoons. These bad guys are going to kill them if they get the chance. This isn't about being a superhero. This is a mother sending her children out into the real world, which will kill them if they are not careful. They have to watch their actions carefully and not let anyone take advantage of them. That is a hard thing for a mother to do, but she has no choice in the film, and a mother has no choice in real life. 

I can't think of anything to matchup to these parts in Incredibles 2. Everything is very flat and no one grows. There are parts of a thread in the film that could lead to something great, but they are ultimately dropped. The movie ends on pretty much exactly the same note. We could have another sequel and it would have been as nothing happened, besides Jack-Jack and legalization (which I thought would have been fine after they saved the city in the first. They basically did the same thing).

It was a great movie, but it did not live up to the fourteen year wait. Unless I am missing something major.",8r7d6q

e1v1h3e,"I really, really hated this movie and I‚Äôm surprised it got such good reviews but I guess this is one of those movies where I hate it despite everybody else liking it.

e0tpv1o,"My viewing of Bao was almost ruined simply by the standard movieplex experience. After 7-8 trailers (roughly 18 minutes) and the bizarre, inexplicable mini-documentary about Incredibles 2 where they talked about the 14 year hiatus, I was pissed when I realized that I had to also watch a short film before the feature. Then I remembered that this is the Pixar tradition and I'd also seen the little trailer for this short, so I calmed down. But goddamn, waited nearly 30 minutes after the actual start time for the real movie to start. That's fucking stupid.",8r7d6q

e0pz9tf,"I just now realized that the Incredibles movies are set sometime around 1960s, 70s maybe... throughout the entire first movie with all of the hyper-advanced technology Syndrome and Edna use, I always assumed it was present day or near present day. Seeing the scene in Incredibles 2 where Dash turns on the TV in hotel to watch an old style Godzilla type movie on a vintage TV made me wonder. I'm not sure if I should feel stupid or not.",8r7d6q
e0qt37f,"Although I kind of predicted what would happen(I had a feeling the Brother or the Sister would betray the Incredibles) it was still a fun movie and worth the 14 year wait. 

I really liked that they started up right where the last movie ended. 

I loved it when they discovered that Jack Jack had more powers. 

I also loved Violet‚Äôs arc as a character. 

The score was also amazing. 

The short was also really cute and sweet. I also think I understood the short, I think the dumpling was supposed to represent her son and she hated that he was growing up or hated the fact that he got married.

e0uz6hp,"I really loved the fight scenes in these movies. Honestly, this has some of the best super hero action I've seen in a movie. Things like the MCU movies and DCU movies annoy me a little bit because you rarely get to actually see the action- the hits don't feel like they have impact and the action really just feels choreographed.

To me, the action in this movie really felt authentic and spontaneous. The heroes took hits and reacted accordingly. I even saw a scene where Elastagirl limped for a few steps after her big fight... also, that fight in the Faraday caged was legitimately intense.",8r7d6q
e0xtluj,"This movie had way more emotional depth than your average Superhero movie, but I would still call it a ""kids"" movie.

e16debe,"Gosh, what a disappointment. I've dreamt about an Incredibles sequel for over a decade and all the exciting directions they could take the followup, but it feels like the creators took a very lazy path. This is not a bad movie of course, Pixar/Disney is pretty much incapable of making outright bad movies at this point. The animations are stellar, the detail in the characters and environments is remarkable, and the action choreography is very impressive. Yet, all that is just hitting the baseline expectations of most animated movies these days. In my opinion, considering this sequel to be at all comparable to the original is doing a disservice to the genius of that first movie.

My main issue is that this movie's main goal is to be funny and goofy. The original was funny, very funny, but it didn't go out of its way to place the characters in funny situations. The humor developed naturally from observing the characters in the situations that they found themselves in. For example, Bob and Lucius trying to relive the glory days was really funny and also informed us about where the characters are at that point in their life. The same is true during Bob's first fight against the Omnidroid, where he is trying to get his mojo back and accidentally throws out his back. The scene is funny, moves the plot forward, and also develops his character. The first movie is filled with scenes like this, that function in multiple ways simultaneously.

In contrast, this sequel feels the need to set aside scenes only for humor. The biggest example is the extended fight between Jack-Jack and the raccoon, which is cute, but tells us nothing about any of the characters and is totally inconsequential to the plot. Often times, characters behave out-of-character for the purpose of a funny scene. Dash is probably the biggest offender in this regard, with his scenes featuring him causing (or attempting to cause) inconsequential havoc and destruction for the sole purpose of entertaining the audience. Whole plot threads exist primarily for the purpose of humor too. At the end of the first movie, Violet is confident and self-assured and casually invites Tony on a date. But for this movie, a small series of misunderstandings and minor embarrassments reduce her to an emotional wreck, eating ice cream out of the container, spewing water out her nose and even renouncing superheroes. This is all just for humor though of course, since by the time the final act rolls around she is totally normal again and ready to fight with her family.

I feel this focus on humor is the result of this movie not having any other strong reason for existing. Again, this is not a bad movie. All of these scenes are well constructed and entertaining, but it is not special or memorable in any way.",8r7d6q

Though it's set right after the first film, the characters felt a little too different for me, most of all Mr Incredible. Did like his arc in this film though.

Same plot about trying to make superheroes legal again and then someone trying to stop it. The villain was too obvious but yea im just nitpicking. It was just a safe thing to do and thats what Pixar does im not surprised. I just wish they took a risk sometimes with the plot. Make it less predictable.

Seriously, it took a bit for me to register that it was wrapping up, it was that quick. It'll probably take me a while to get a better opinion on this one.

e0w9s8z,"My opinion on Incredibles 2: What a fantastic movie. I mean I really enjoyed this film. It carries the momentum from the first and lives up to the hype. I'm honestly amazed that it is actually really good and has the same spirit of the first. I loved how it moves the story along instead of rehashing the first; that's very appreciated. I just have so much zeal for the characters and I adore how it fleshed them out more. The animation is of course great. The story is very simple and nice. To be honest I am just happy to see a refreshing sequel instead of most sequels we get. Now there are themes of control, accepting who you are, and obviously family. Interestingly there are two plots in this: one plot with Elasticgirl and one with Mr. Incredible and the family. In the Mr. Incredible plot it shows a good way of getting control; by being gentle and honest and non forcefully. While in Elasticgirl the villian tries to control everyone with hypnosis, with force; basically meaning that the good way to control is non forcefully and being kind. Speaking of the plots, I really am fond about Mr. Incredible's plot with the family. It's very sweet how the family operates. You can tell that this film was made with real care. I do, however, have one kinda major complaint: the villian. I thought that the ""twist"" was predictable and not very original. And knowing what was going to happen ruined the Elasticgirl plot for me a little. I also thought that this movie doesn't have much of an impact the first Incredibles had, and I think the first one is better. Other than that I think it's a very sweet family/super heroe movie with great characters and action. So I would rate it a 8.5/10.",8r7d6q

First of all I'm still convinced that Edna is Violet's biological mom that she gave to the Parr's to raise.

Second of all, baby jack-jack staying with Edna was the best part. Third of all I fully expected tech lady to be the villain but I expected her brother to be in on it, so I was actually a bit surprised. ",8r7d6q
e0qwtxp,"Overall I loved it but man, what a letdown after we got a great villain in Syndrome. I think I was the only one who didnt see the twist coming and that was because I thought it was way too obvious and Brad Bird was smarter than that. Still a worthy sequel to an amazibg movie! ",8r7d6q

e0rgnbk,"After seeing it, I'd say it's on par (no pun intended) with the original. Not only does it continue the story like a good sequel should, but it also does a great job of mirroring its predecessor as well, staying true to the overarching themes that made the first film so memorable. Add to that some more politically incorrect social commentary, complete with a villain whose tactics are uncannily similar to what we're seeing in the real world, and you get a surprisingly relevant message that's reminiscent of Zootopia in a lot of ways. All in all, I'd say the 14-year wait payed off!",8r7d6q

e0thewf,"Enjoyed this movie heavily. Some pacing problem because they had so much to cover but still well done.

Evolved the themes from the first one perfectly while also telling it's own story. Very amazing action scenes too. Want a superhero horror movie because of the scene in the Screensavers layer now. 

Well worth the wait and honestly would love a third one where we get to see them fave a supervillain with actual powers as long as they can make it as emotional as the first two.

Great film and probably one of the best hero movies ever.",8r7d6q
e0ttuen,"Pros: It's a good movie. Made for your whole family and is super fun to watch. Humors are great and appropriate. Action scenes are nicely executed. Shifting the spotlight to Helen is a nice touch to give the continued story a fresh air. You've seen enough of Bob in the previous movie - now it's time for another hero with a different set of skills and they totally delivered this part.

Cons: Jack-Jack is way over-exploited in the plot it makes the writers seem lazy af, this could almost be a Jack-Jack movie. Music is meh. Villain is so disappointing, not even close to Buddy who had a fantastic story and lines and actions - the new one doesn't have any of those and I saw the identity of the villain from miles away. Final battle is even a bigger disappointment. There's some repetitions in the plot from the original movie but not many and I can make a pass.

If this is a normal sequel, then everything is just fine, maybe not top-notch but fine. This, however, made people waited 14 years for it, and didn't fully deliver. Good, but not enough.",8r7d6q

e14n976,"The Incredibles is probably my all time favorite animated movie so I had high hopes for this movie as well.

Honestly, it delivered. Sure the villain was a bit weaker and obvious, but I thought the humor and animation were much better than the first one.

I was really afraid that I'd get sick of Jack-Jack's antics but I actually thought he was one of the highlights of this movie. 

Is it is good as the last movie? Probably not, but that's mostly because of how fresh that movie was. This movie playing with the same themes as the first time makes it not as fresh, but still just as fun.",8r7d6q
e0qlutp,"Jack-Jack would destroy Thanos in a heartbeat.

This was pretty much everything I wanted it to be. Hilarious, inventive, beautiful, tense, character-centric, and new enough. Yes, the plot was rather familiar and the resolution was predictable, but god damn it I had so much fun along the way that I don't really care.

I think the most impressive part of Incredibles 2 was the action. I'm dead serious when I say that this film has better action than 90% of superhero movies. Elasti-girl's bike chase scene, Jack-jack vs. raccoon, the helicopter scene, and the final battle were immersing, imaginative, and exciting sequences.

Humor was top-notch. Although not quite as quippy as the first one, the sequel more than made up for it with hilarious physical and situational humor. Jack-Jack stole the show; everything he did was a guaranteed laugh from our audience.

After watching the first Incredibles yesterday, I was amazed at how far the animation had come in the past 14 years. I mean, it's not all that surprising, but it was still shocking to see the attention to detail, fluidity, and beauty of the animation in Incredibles 2.

Although Elasti-girl had a pretty similar character-arc to Mr. Incredible in the original, I still enjoyed the character stories in Incredibles 2. The villain, while obviously predictable, was still creative and satisfying, and I loved that we got to see the kids save the day this time. My only qualm is that I wish we had gotten to see more Dash and Frozone's wife.

Overall, while Incredibles 2 is not a perfect film, it's loads of fun, hysterical, and original enough that you'll find no issue looking past its flaws.",8r7d6q

Oversexualizing Mrs. Incredible was WAY too heavy handed this time and mah boi Dash never got anything to do and his scene was easily the highlight of the original. I don‚Äôt know, still processing but I‚Äôm very whelmed. ",8r7d6q
e0un78n,"The movie was good overall, but it doesn't reach the same heights as the first. Remember the wave of emotions [when Mr. Incredible remembers his hero days?](https://youtu.be/m1bBie9tVWQ?t=124) Remember [how Ellen discovered Bob's secret while Bob learned Syndrome's plot, and the intensity of the 'escape' afterward?](https://youtu.be/IRPI3lSACFc?t=55) The first movie is full of amazing scenes like that. But not this movie. The cinematography is just kind of ""okay"", it never really adds energy to any scene. No memorable music to elevate the emotions of any scene.

I also want to say this movie is very predictable. From the first message from the 'Screenslaver,' it's obvious that the attack was an inside job. How else would he be expecting Elastigirl? That narrowed it down to only two suspects - Evelyn (the genius inventor, who clearly had the talents to do all this) and Winston (who just looks euphoric to see his childhood heroes, and only deals in business and networking). So there's not much intrigue to keep the plot interesting.

The emotional beats of the movie are okay. Bob's conflict is interesting, his performance is pretty good and has a nice arc. The subplot of Violet's boyfriend is interesting and adds a lot of depth to her, and the Jack-Jack antics are fun. There's really no personal drama in Helen's subplot, she's all business with no emotional baggage. The action scenes aren't interesting because there's no personal beef between her and Screenslaver. The Pixar short before the movie was far more engaging in that aspect.

The movie has the same problem as Finding Dory - main characters from the first movie are still there in the new movie, but they really don't have much purpose. In Finding Dory that was Nemo and Marlin, and in this movie it's Dash and Edna. Dash has some funny dialogue, but really nothing to do plot-wise except make Bob's housekeeping more difficult, and play with the Incredimobile. Edna's just there to upgrade Jack-Jack's costume with new features, and babysit him for one day.

Also, the whole ""making superheroes legal"" conflict was mishandled IMO. The villain had a very weak motivation (""my parents trusted superheroes [who were probably miles away] to save them, and they died, and somehow that's the heroes' fault!"") and goal (""superheroes are already illegal, but I'm going to make them *even more illegal!*""). The case for making superheroes illegal is not effectively presented, it really feels like they're illegal for no founded reason. I'm aware that superheroes were illegal in the first movie, but it wasn't a major focus of the plot so it didn't bother me then. And that movie ended with the whole city thanking the Incredibles for saving them from the Omnidroid, so it didn't seem right that they suddenly hated them after the Underminer incident.

Overall, I give the movie 2 1/2 stars, maybe 3. It's a good movie, but I have no interest in rewatching it. The first Incredibles is possibly Pixar's best movie, but this one doesn't hold a candle to movies like Coco, Up, Toy Story 3, etc.",8r7d6q

e1csy2f,"The only thing I found genuinely about this movie is that Evelyn is clearly a heavy drinker (if not an outright alcoholic), and it goes completely unremarked upon by the other characters and the script passes no judgment on her. I would have liked to see more of that character in general; she felt original, whereas as the rest of the movie is basically rehashing the same character moments and plot points as the first.",8r7d6q
e8m8v27,"I'm confused. Why doesn't Elastigirl just closer her eyes since the evil villian just told her that she was going to use her and it's bloody obvious by now that both people know that Evelyn uses the goggles.

You can't say that the goggles hold people's eyes open, which is physically impossible if you're jamming that into people's faces, it would damage their eyes and cause them to shut up and probably tear out their eye lids and damage their eyes causing a lot of bleeding and interfere with the goggle screen's hypo effects.

Also, the effects of hypnosis via weird signals, aren't instant, you would need at least a few seconds, before being fully hypnotised. Which is more than enough time for someone to shut their eyes, regardless of whether they know about it or not. Especially, when that someone is aware of said villain's powers.

Also, **WHY DON'T THE KIDS TRY TO TAKE OFF THE OTHER SUPER HEROES GOGGLES AT THE BEGINNING!** I mean those goggles aren't exactly glued on and sure they're tight, but they're easily put on, so they should be easily put off. I'm pretty sure that that would be the first thing on 99% of each person's mind if they were fighting those hyponed villains.

Also, if their are constant hyponosis waves to enslave the wearer, then how the hell do they see anything? Do you only need to have one eye hypotised to be fully under Evelyn's control? If so, then that might explain how there could be a tiny camera in the lens that shows them what's outside the goggles to the other eye.

Violet could have easily taken off Void's goggles and gotten her to help out when she knocked out Void and she and Dash could have easily taken off the goggles of all the hyponed villians when Jack Jack sat on the and knocked them all out, because they're seen everyone's powers. I mean, they know they'd have a hard time against their parents and frozone who are elite super's. So, they need all the help they can get.

As much as I enjoyed the movie, this plot hole sticks out like a serious sore thumb and is something that I never expected would land itself in a Pixar movie of all things! Even if it's a collaboration!

Also, is it me or does Dash seem a hell of a lot slower in this movie than the first one? The kid can run on water for god's sake! He should have been the one to search the ship, not violet! Even she should have known that, I mean, Dash can run so fast that no human eye can catch him! So, he's as good as invisible to everyone and even if they can feel a gush of wind, they won't know it's the kid or if they do, they won't have a reaction time fast enough to even do anything about it. Not even void. Plus, if they're racing against time, which they are, then Dash is by far the best choice. Even kids would be able to figure this out. As Violet can easily put a big force field around Jack Jack to keep him in one place, except when he enters another dimension, when she senses trouble by keeping tabs on the portable monitor they always keep around.

&#x200B;

Why didn't void use her powers to slice the escape aircraft in half or at least clip it's wings? She should have easily have known that she can do that by now.",8r7d6q
e2l2cx8,Why did Mr. Incredible nonchalantly dismiss memory wiping? Violet obviously got mad but why not confused and scared too?

It's been such a long time since I last saw an audience so enamored with and enthusiastic for a single movie, and seeing a whole new generation fall in love with this movie was the most heartwarming thing.

I know there's kind of a joke going around about how the 20-somethings should be given piority for this one since they've been waiting for this movie for so long, but watching this movie with a packed crowd made me remember why the first Incredibles is such a classic: It's a crowdpleaser in every sense of the word, with a perfect balance of action, characters, humour and drama. Regardless of who you are, the first Incredibles was a movie that absolutely anyone could find something to enjoy- and the sequel managed to recapture that rare lightning in a bottle. While it may not be as narratively stong as its predecessor, Incredibles 2 retains the charm that made the first movie work, and I couldn't be happier.

e1eh7j5,"Saw it last night. Overall: I enjoyed it a good bit, but I don't think it lived up to the first one.

My major gripe with the film is the villain, who didn't feel developed enough as her own character outside of the single argument with her brother early in the movie. Felt like a watered-down Syndrome. She wasn't charismatic or intriguing and her plan was a little too convoluted and murky. She never felt threatening or sympathetic to me, she was just... there. If she had a little more bombast and character development I think she would have fit better with the movie.

The animation was gorgeous, the soundtrack and aesthetics suitably midcentury retro. While fun, I do feel like the action sequences were too similar to each other in that they were almost all ""stop a moving vehicle from crashing.""

Bob's stay-home-with-the-kids storyline dragged a bit in the middle. It seemed like he was changing his ways with Dash's math homework but it never really went anywhere. No joy or pride in the task, nothing but grumbling and a lack of sleep. The only moment that came close to that was him trying to help Violet but that backfired too. It just seemed to take up entirely too much space in the movie while all we learned from it is that Bob really wants to be a super again (which we already knew) and that parenting is hard.

This movie was bright and fun but unnecessary. Finding Dory lived up to Finding Nemo, the Toy Story sequels lived up the the original, but this one fell flat for me. It lacked those emotional ""Pixar moments"" and rehashed the themes and story of the first one without anything of its own to add.",8r7d6q

Other notes:
- Just because Evelyn got captured in the end doesn't mean she was wrong. She's totally right in that people shouldn't use supers as a crutch to solve their problems, but I think she's ignoring the fact that a lot of problems require super solutions.

e0p6u3r,"This is such a beautiful, thrilling film, isn't it? As much as I love The Incredibles and the visual set pieces of that, there are so many wonderful visual moments and sequences in this.

The score by Michael Giacchino was excellent as always.  

Also, I appreciated how the first movie revolved mostly around Mr. Incredible and Dash with Violet and Elasti-Girl as supporting and this movie flipped that and gave Elasti-Girl and Violet starring roles and great character arcs.

* Animations were dope.

* The scene at the diner when Violet shoots water out of her nose was knee slapping funny. 

* Jack-Jack shared some of the powers (in some form) with the other superheroes seen (mostly Void and Reflux).

* Caught an easter egg towards the end.

* Picked up on a couple other jokes that were pretty good too. 

* Edna was fantastic.

* You could tell by the voices that this was done a decade later. Dash was the most noticeable.

* The Krush guy is an earthbender.  

My complaints:

* Mentioned above with Elastigirl and ScreenSlaver

* The storyline seemed easy to guess (according to my friend). It took me a little longer to figure it out but managed to do it before it's revealed.

e0qr6ng,"So to start I want to say that the original Incredibles is one of my favorite films of all time and I think one of the best animated screenplays ever. I know because I have watched it about ten times, seen countless video essays on it, and literally rewatched it last night in anticipation of this movie. You should seriously go back and rewatch the original because it is such an incredibly tight film from start to finish, there is absolutely NO wasted screentime and it is such a tonally focused, well written script, every character is fun and alive, Jason Lee as Syndrome is both sinister and hilarious in the villain role, every setpiece is both exciting and plot critical (as in tied to character and developemnt as much as they are for fun), the designs and anaimation are amazing (and very groundbreaking at the time) and everything just...fits perfectly.

So, that being said, my expectations for this movie were admittedly pretty high. This has been a movie I have anticipated for a long time. My girlfriend and I got matching Incredibles and Syndrome shirts to wear to the opening night. The nostalgic kid in me was READY for this film.

But also, the grown-up with an English degree in me...had some reservations. We are in a world of cinematic universes and sequel after sequel. Big budget studio movies are becoming more and more about pointing to other big budget studio movies than about pointing to....I don't know, anything else. It's kind of a weird time to be a movie-goer who would like to see these kinds of movies tread on unsteady ground as opposed to following the tried and true mores of nostalgia.

By the end of the movie, both the little kid and the English major in me felt pretty vindicated in their thoughts before the movie.

My initial thoughts were that the 14 years that have elapsed (which the pre-roll behind the scenes short was quick to remind me of) have been...less than kind to the spirit of this film. This script feels a lot less like the incredibly tight, rich world of the original, and a lot more like Disney went to Brad Bird and said ""can you please do another one?"" The time gap is most obvious in the performances of the voice actors, who often feel a bit uncomfortable in the shoes of characters they probably thought they'd wrapped up with a decade and a half ago (or in the case of some characters, were filled by a different actor entirely.) I mean, don't get me wrong, no one was terrible, but really, you can feel the difference, for me most notably with Nelson and Hunter as well as some moments with Edna. There's something a little bit uncanny about some of the characters; I think the kids all felt pretty spot on to the original but the adults were a bit stilted and just...off, kind of. Elastigirl feels like she jumps into the heroics a little bit too quickly; Mr. Incredible has a whole plotline about not feeling activated that doesn't seem to go too far.

In general the whole choice to set the film immediately after the events of the first one is a really bizarre choice to me (I'm guessing the constraint of having to keep the kids as kids is the biggest factor to not jumping forward in time a year or so.) It feels like it's constraining the film the whole time, because they don't reference the original too much except in a pandering, referential kind of way (the whole line by Elastigirl about how she's such a hypocrite for being being mad at Bob in the first movie was pretty weird.) Also, when is this family going to stop listening to rich playboys promising them opportunities to relive the glory days? Never seems to work out too well for them.
Another thing that bothered me was the character deign of the new supers, the original film gives no indication that any of the supers were weird alien/bird/cockatoo human hybrids, they were all just pretty standard comic book supers with that classy Golden Age look. The new guys are...not that. They don't have much life to them, and the fact that I can only remember Voyd's name is not a great indicator of their character quality.

The villain reveal was incredibly unsurprising and honestly, compare that chick to Syndrome, it is no comparison, the original film had SUCH a better villain. Catherine Keener was pretty meh. Jason Lee knocked the role out of the park. Also Bob Odenkirk's character was...okay.

I feel like I'm only saying things I found off...I really loved the set pieces in this movie, I found them really exciting and fun and they did some really creative stuff for them. The Jak Jak bits were the highlight of the film and he was both adorable and hilarious throughout. I could watch that shit for hours. The kids' storylines were good I thought. ANd Sam Jackson is such a rock solid actor, he was one of the only ones who felt like he jumped right back into the role.

Overall I would say, it's worth a watch in theatres, probably not repeat viewings. But that makes me sad honestly. Because I feel like I'm saying that about more and more movies these days. I know I will get hate and pushback on this but, I have serious sequel exhaustion and don't feel this film added anything huge to the magic that is ""The Incredibles saga"" and mostly lived off that of the original. It felt overall like a film that was pushed out because people were clamoring for it. And it's obvious that people wanted this, hell I wanted it too. But I have mixed feelings because I also think that pumping an IP for all its worth can ruin some of the magic of it. We apparently need a backstory or a continuation for everything these days. We've gotta have a Han Solo backstory, a mysterious character whose appeal is drawn largely from his mystery. We need to know what Ant-Man was doing before the Infinity Gauntlet shit because reasons. I feel like in some ways this film hits those same pitfalls. I mean really, if you could only show your kid the original or this one (excluding any logistics about knowing the story beforehand) which would you choose? I give it a 7.5/10.",8r7d6q

I went in knowing it wasn't going to be better than the first. And how could it be Pixar is a different company and times have changed. This movie shows that with its humor being more light hearted.

Overall, I would have preferred a different direction, but still enjoyed it. ",8r7d6q
e0tu6du,"Is this really the best Pixar could do?


1. A complete plot rehash but with characters switched. However in the first one the moral of the film is ‚ÄúMr Incredible can‚Äôt do this alone, let‚Äôs work together as a family‚Äù and then we got several scenes of each character showing off their powers and realizing their true potentials alone and together as a team. The moral of this story is ‚ÄúGo finish your fight Elastic girl, you can do this on your own‚Äù, then we see Bob get beat up by a giant brick, fails to punch through some pipes, Elastic Girl defeats the main bad guy with a flare gun and watch as Dash heroically pushes a button, huh?


2. Each major action scene is the exact same premise. Opening scene: Stop a giant rampaging drill. Middle Scene: Stop a rampaging train. End Scene: Stop a rampaging boat. Luckily Frozone is there two of the three times to shoot his powers at the ground to slow the rampaging (insert vehicle) down!


3. What are the character arcs here? Bob is a bad dad and that learns math? He never really learns to be a better dad, he just learns to admit he is a bad one? Parenting sure is hard for men, but at least it is comical! Violet learns in the ending fight that being a babysitter is the most important thing she can do. Dash does math and pushes a button. Elastic Girl leaves her family and never at any point in the film after that does really gives a shit about them. At one point it‚Äôs even foreshadowed she‚Äôll have some character development when Void asks ‚Äúhow do you balance super hero and personal life?‚Äù, the audience knows the answer to this‚Ä¶it‚Äôs poorly, but its never address, Elastic GIrl is only briefly concerned about Jack Jack‚Äôs powers for a second at the end of the movie and then gets light headed in a plane, great character. And then there is Jack Jack


4. Jack Jack, how much of the film is devoted to this guy? 30%-40%-50%? And what does it accomplish at all besides empty consequence free humor that had absolutely no bearing on characters or plot except for making Bob a little more tired (which two of his other kids already did, and is a dilemma he never really learns to overcome anyway). Each scene in the Incredibles 1, as far as I can remember, advanced something, either plot or character. Half of this movie is as if they remade Jack Jack attack several times and stuck it in throughout the film. Jack Jack fights a raccoon, Jack Jack gets a suit from Edna, Jack Jack runs around on a boat, Jack Jack watches TV. Whats the point? The whole thing is a foil for Bob to learn something about parenting, but unlike the Math scene with Dash, Jack Jack teaches Bob nothing except that a fancy suit knows when Jack Jack goes to another dimension. What‚Äôs the point here? Jack Jack ends up on the boat at the end and‚Ä¶pulls of Elastic Girls glasses, that‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been waiting for. Dash or Violet could have done this. When I watched each of Jack jack‚Äôs scenes all I could imagine was a youtube title below it with 10million + views. ‚ÄúJack Jack fights raccoon, ALL POWERS, VERY FUNNY!‚Äù. 50k uplikes! What a consequence free drag of empty humor. 


5.  Consequence free. This movie drops all the weight and levity of the first film. In Lion King a father dies, in Toy Story Woody feels exclusion and Incredibles 1 dealt with a slew of Family issues. As the comments in this thread will painfully tell you, Disney and Pixar makes movies for kids, as if that‚Äôs some magic excuse to remove thought or feeling from a movie. But each Disney/Pixar movie that came before this dealt with some serious theme or emotion that any person could understand, experience or relate to. Where was that in this movie? All I saw was a bumbling dad as a reminder that men can‚Äôt raise kids good. Math is tough and it‚Äôs hard to ask a boy on a date when the FBI erases his brain. It really says a lot when the 5 minute short Bao had more emotional weight than this entire movie. I‚Äôve done math before, but I‚Äôll never been a Chinese mother, yet someone I connected to her more? Lol what an absolute joke. 


6. Villains. What is this woman‚Äôs motivation? The scenes in which her and elastic girl talked to each other were some of the weirdest strangely paced pieces of dialogue I‚Äôve ever seen, I couldn‚Äôt follow what the intended message was. What was Screenslavers motivation for derailing a train. Did she want to boost Elastic Girl‚Äôs fame up before tearing it down? She seemed broken up about her parents dying, why would she suddenly want more people to die? She wanted to make heroes even more illegal? But they‚Äôre already illegal, what the heck does more illegal mean? Seems like her actual nemesis was her brother, couldn‚Äôt she have just brainwashed her brother instead to make him stop trying to bring heroes back and they‚Äôd stay illegal that way? He was the reason they were coming back! And then they mix in politics, signatures and ambassadors, haha ya real good relatable kids movie stuff there (reminds me of the Phantom Menace). 
",8r7d6q
e0rcx54,"Is no one talking about the amazing dialogue Brad Bird slipped into this movie? Like these theatrical scenes that had no business being in an animated movie yet worked so well and the entire audience bought. Example: the discussion between Elastigirl and Evelyn about whether it's better to be an inventor or seller is a theses on humanity and probably something that weighs heavy on Bird's mind day to day. Beyond that, the notion that the bad guy monologue tackles this Mr Robot type mantra of everyone being slaves to screens and that we use superheroes as surrogates, as if we're not all sitting in our theater seats doing exactly that. Bird, you cheeky freak. Honestly, this is Pixar's Dark Knight. Like Sammy Jackson said in that goofy pre movie making of, this was MUTHA FUCKIN worth the wait.",8r7d6q

Monsters University - **NO!**

Finding Dory - **NO!**

Incredibles 2 - **OH MY FUCKING GOD YES!!**

Seriously Guys... Don't sit on this film! I saw ""The Incredibles"" in theaters at 6 years old, and now at 20, ""Incredibles 2"" is *EASILY* as good as the original. Forgot about how ""Finding Dory"" and ""Monsters University"" were supposed to bring your childhood back, and how... while they aren't bad films by any means... something was missing. I can't think of anything that could possibly improve ""Incredibles 2""... I seriously can't think of anything, and it's easily one of my favorite films of the year. I was hoping ""Isle of Dogs"" would take the Oscar for best animated film giving Wes Anderson his first Oscar... but damn does he have some competition with this film.

TL;DR: ""Incredibles 2"" is as good as the  reviews say it is... also my childhood is back. ",8r7d6q
e1ljdr1,"I was really disappointed by this movie. The story is a terrible remake of the first film. 

1. Instead of Mr Incredible getting hired by the villain it is elastigirl who gets hired by the Villain.

2. Instead of elastigirl and family going to save Mr incredible, you have Mr incredible and family going to save elastigirl..

3. Villain doesn't have a superpower but is an inventor.

4. Heroes are banned, why doesn't the villain just leave them banned and refuse to help her brother?

5. The villain is a wealthy and intelligent inventor who wants to break the law and risk killing thousands of people on the train so she can restore superheroes to the spotlight just so she can get them banned again?

6. And the reason she hates superheroes has to be the biggest reach in any movie. Her father rang a Superhero line after the superheros were made illegal. How can she possibly blame superheros? If superheroes had been legal they might have saved her father. But she doesn't blame the people who made them illegal, she doesn't blame the criminals who shot her father, she wants to blame superheros who were not even involved in the incident in any way...

7. Why wasn't the superhero line inside the safe room?

e0vdizj,"I liked it better than Finding Dory, but I think this suffers from the same issue of the movie ultimately being exactly what I thought it would be, and not doing enough to justify its existence as a sequel. I did really like how they made it fairly obvious who the main villain was from the start though. ",8r7d6q
e18j4l3,"Bottom line, if you liked the first one you'll like this one because it's very similar to the first one with the roles of Elastigirl and Mr. Incredible reversed for the most part. Everyone gets their moment to shine both during the heroics and family moments. 

The music is every bit as good and 'Bond like' as the original. The setting is less 'remote tropical island' and more retrofuturistic urban city. The animation remains top notch. A lot of familiar cues and catch phrases return. The plot is less 'dark' comparatively. No one murdered a bunch of Supers perfecting a kill-bot for instance. Given what the story is this time around, there's no call for things being quite as grim as before (though there are of course stakes and peril) so it doesn't feel like anything was watered down just because Mr. Incredible isn't hiding behind Gazerbeam's corpse to fool a probe. 

The villain may not have been as great as Jason Lee's over the top 'spurned' wannabe sidekick turned evil but the banter is passable, the villain gets the job done and gives Elastigirl a chance to do the detective work showcasing more of her crime fighting skills besides her already formidable powers. 

Superbaby gets a lot of screen time but it never feels wasted as Jackjack delivers. 

Frozone remains fun to watch, between Samuel L Jackson's portrayal and the speed-skater like movements along his ice platforms he's far from 'just an Iceman clone'.

Going forward I'm not sure they could tell the same story a third time with the same success (great if they can) so if another sequel is being considered it will have to set itself apart somehow. For a third outing I could see it being a 'Parr family trying to keep up with the super-Joneses' type of thing. Maybe they find they have rivals in another family of Supers who vex the Parrs in both their civilian and heroic lives. Maybe they (the Joneses) are the villains or maybe they're both manipulated by the villain and end their feud to team up in the third act. 

An animated series would be intriguing. They could do a 'super how I met your mother', which offers a good opportunity for more scenes from the 'Glory Days'. Or super 'modern family', maybe the Parrs are no longer the only family of Supers and the show cuts between families of Supers. Or, a more heroic leaning, Incredibles version of ""Justice League"" that takes a mockumentary approach exploring the characters trying to balance their heroics and civilian lives.",8r7d6q
e195f2a,"This is without a doubt better than the first for me. The freaking cinematography and the settings are beautifully animated, especially the cyber aesthetic in the villain's lair in the apartment and the boat. I loved the suspense and the thriller-type sequences accented by the brilliant performance and animation undercut by the levity in the characters in the mansion arc. AND THE FUCKING FIGHT SCENES were incredible, especially the creepy one in the apartment and the finale on the boat with all the superheroes working together, and that's not to mention the scenes with Elastigirl, who's taken my spot as #1",8r7d6q
e0tio2w,"Loved the movie, and as always everyone's covered all the things I wanted to say!

I've got a few nitpicks and questions, if anyone's sorting by new:

* Was the audio weird for anyone else, or just my cinema? Especially elastigirl's voice, just sounded like it was cutting out at the top end (sorry dont know audio terminology)
* What was up with those two shots in the house where everything looked like it wasn't rendered properly? Was it an effect or just not finished to the same standard?
* Anyone notice weird shadows w/ Mr Incredible's face in some scenes (one eye completely in the shadow of his blocky nose)?

Was the extended conversation between Elastigirl & Evelyn tonally odd to anyone? Can't place my finger on it. Not sure if it was:

* Awkwardly written
* Odd placement of downtime (long conversation)
* Weird audio in my theatre
* Or maybe that I rarely see 2 women talking on screen??
* Maybe my unconscious misogyny ??",8r7d6q

A lot of people say the movie was bland and predictable, but I think the social commentary was very bold and thought-provoking.

e15echg,"I just recently watched *Incredibles 2* and I gotta say‚Ä¶I‚Äôm both disappointed but not surprised.

Just to get it out of the way/summarize my feelings overall, I‚Äôd give the movie a 6/10. It was gorgeously animated, beautifully scored, and the action scenes were even better than the original with how creative and well thought out they were. I enjoyed it overall and I‚Äôm going to see it for a second time (more out of obligation because of plans) but there‚Äôs still many problems, mostly relating to the writing.

When I first saw the trailers for *Incredibles 2*, I immediately thought to myself ‚ÄúThis looks like *Mr. Mom* but with superpowers,‚Äù and my expectations were lowered immensely. The whole ‚Äúdad can‚Äôt seem to handle the child/children without his wife‚Äù plot has been overplayed to hell and back since the beginning of film. If it isn‚Äôt in a movie, it‚Äôs in a TV show, and if it isn‚Äôt in a TV show, it‚Äôs in the Bounty commercials between breaks. It. Is. EVERYWHERE. And frankly, I‚Äôm tired of it.

I thought maybe they would do something different with this formula since they‚Äôre a family of supers. In a sense, they‚Ä¶kinda did. But overall, it was the same boring, formulaic bullshit. It also felt VERY off in terms of pacing. There was a point where they threw in a random minute of him finally being able to handle being a father by learning how to do the math with this hopeful music and the colors being brighter than normal‚Ä¶but in the next scene of him and the kids he‚Äôs fumbling around like an idiot. It made no sense in terms of how that subplot flowed. They couldn‚Äôt save it for when he actually WAS doing a good job near the end? I‚Äôm thankful that him being a fumbling father didn‚Äôt eat up too much time. Most of the time was dedicated to Elastigirl trying to solve the case of Screen Slaver.

Now I knew Screen Slaver was never going to live up to Syndrome as a villain, but I was NOT expecting [her to be so cookie cutter either. It was very frustrating to see the villain be another ‚Äúmy parents died and now I‚Äôm mad‚Äù type. What made Syndrome so fucking amazing was how he was the product of Mr. Incredibles‚Äô past actions as well as the reason why supers were dying out. His actions were damn well near relatable and his plan to make superheroes obsolete by making everyone super was incredible writing (and something people still discuss to this day). Plus, his reveal, while a tad bit predictable, was pretty great. It was short and didn‚Äôt feel like they were dragging it out for a long time. Screen Slaver‚Äôs actions in my opinion were UNDERSTANDABLE but not RELATABLE. I can see her thought process and why she made the decisions she did, but it‚Äôs not something I feel a lot of people can relate to. I also did not like how long it took for them to reveal who she was. I don‚Äôt know about everyone else, but I figured out Screen Slaver‚Äôs identity LONG before the reveal, so the whole time I was kinda just impatiently waiting for the ‚Äúbig reveal‚Äù and when it happened I kinda just thought ‚Äú‚Ä¶ok?‚Äù](#spoiler)

[Her plan also felt less weighty. If her plan had worked, the worst possible outcome would be that supers would be made illegal again‚Ä¶like they always have been up until the present time in the movie. Sure, supers would be seen in a MUCH more negative light, but nothing would really change. Supers would be illegal, but a few goodhearted supers (including the Incredibles) would still do the right thing and stop crime, then go back into hiding. I didn‚Äôt feel like I should care about whether or not she should win.](#spoiler)

[I also didn‚Äôt understand why she would choose such a persona. Like, ok I get it, she‚Äôs a tech person. But I didn‚Äôt understand why she would make that long monologue about how society is glued to the TV. My guess is that it was going off the idea of perception her brother brought up in the beginning but other than that, I felt a disconnect between the person and the mask. It might sound like I hate Screen Slaver as a villain, but really, she was just not that good. Not terrible either. Just very‚Ä¶formulaic. She wasn‚Äôt the worst part of the film.](#spoiler)

The absolute WORST part of the film for me though was Jack-Jack. Almost every scene he was in was annoying. The humor involved was mostly ‚ÄúAHAHAHAHA A BABY DOING SILLY BABY THINGS‚Äù and that just isn‚Äôt my kind of humor. There was ONE gag that I legitimately loved from Jack-Jack and that was the scene where [Mr. Incredible was picking him up after Edna Mode was taking care of him and he was walking and holding his lollipop exactly like Edna walked and held her wand.](#spoiler) It was subtle for the most part‚Ä¶but nobody in the movie theater laughed at that part. I felt so alone. And then they showed him being annoying and babbling and EVERYONE lost their shit.

It also felt like they just wrote in his [multiple powers for plot convenience sake near the end. Like the writers thought ‚Äúah shit we put Dash and Violet in a bad position and can‚Äôt think of any way to get them out‚Ä¶I know! Let‚Äôs give Jack-Jack another random power SPECIFICALLY for that situation!‚Äù](#spoiler) It was very annoying.

I kinda wished the whole movie was more like the first 15-20 minutes. There was some legitimately great dialogue and it felt kinda real. Listening to Helen and Bob argue over the laws and how/what they should teach their kids and seeing the kids feeling like shit because their lives are incredibly unstable was very investing. It would have been much more interesting to watch how they would deal with this difficult transition in their lives while also fighting some unknown entity trying to hypnotize everyone.

I know it sounds like I hate this movie, but this review was more about why I didn‚Äôt enjoy it as much as the 1st *Incredibles* movie. I still enjoyed *Incredibles 2* and I am looking forward to watching it for a second time, but it really did feel like another needless sequel, albeit a high quality one.

I‚Äôm glad a lot of people found so much enjoyment out of it too, but it just didn‚Äôt do it for me. If you made it this far in my long-winded post, thank you and I hope to have some nice discussions with everyone!",8r7d6q
e0p3d24,"Loved the action, heart, story (if a tad predictable), the family dynamic and increased roles for Violet, Frozone and Jack Jack.

I am sensitive to those and was not amused. However, the positives more than outweigh the negatives. 8/10

Edit: Also, just a note. Imax sound is fantastic. They remastered the score and soundtrack beautifully, with key moments such as Jack Jack in the other dimension establishing location through sound.

I try not to dwell in these plot holes and just enjoy the movie for what the original was, a heartwarming fun superheroe family pixar flick, which it is. I did felt wanting a more emotional driven plot, being with Violet or Bob/Helen (heck, even the villain) were they have to overcome an internal conflict. Also, I think this is like the 4th time they use the same gimmick of having to stop a runaway train/vehicle before it reaches X location.

e0p8v9p,"Brad Bird once again has proven himself as masterclass of action set pieces

e0p9pc3,"This film was absolutely amazing. I think the action sequences were much better and very creative. Just seeing Elastigirl chase after the train on her bike or fighting Screenslaver in the hideout had me captivated.  
Though it  was pretty obvious about who Screenslaver really was as soon as they were introduced and became more obvious as they went on.  Once the sister started talking about how their parents should have just gone to the safehouse it was a sign and the more she started talking the more it was settled. Still Screenslaver managed to be  really creepy. Something about the way the characters faces looked while being hypnotized was unsettling. 
One thing I really loved was how good it looked. I could tell how much animation had improved in 14 years by just looking the details on the characters faces. Though for some reason the other new super hero characters faces were weird to me. I know Pixar faces aren't exactly accurate, but they just seemed overly cartoonish. 
However, despite it being a very well made film and liking it very much,  I still like the 1st one better. I don't know if it's nostalgia or if I'm looking through rose colored glasses because I first saw it when I was about 10. I kind of kept thinking ""This is it?"" and I know I shouldn't cause I'm lucky to have another one. I probably  set myself up for disappointment because I my expectations were so high.

Overall it was fun, but like most animated sequels, it couldn't capture the magic that made the first one so memorable. This is mostly due to the fact that recapturing the wonder of being introduced to the world and characters isn't something that sequels can do again.

e0rohf5,"PROBABLY MILD  SPOILERS. I'm too lazy to hide them in the actual text so just be warned. 

Dare I say some of this disappointment is due to the impossibly high standards fans have had over the past 14 years? I don't say that to belittle anybodies opinions - but lets not pretend that maybe this film had some unfair standards to live up to. 

 I mean, if we're going by the internet, the first film seems to be one of the most beloved movies of the past 20 years. So with 14 years of waiting, no wonder people are feeling a little letdown. You guys built this thing up in your head FAR too much. 

 It's quite obvious many were expecting something godlike here and had built the perfect Incredibles 2 in their heads. 

The two biggest complaints I keep seeing is ""predictable villain"" and ""not as dark as the first."" 

Urgh, and the Syndrome wasn't predictable in the first film? They telegraphed he would be the villain in the opening scene. He's the very definition of predictable. 

Granted, the villain here isn't as strongly written.. But simply going by the ""too predictable"" complaints - I don't think that's fair at all. 

Not dark enough? Since when was this film being dark a prerequisite? I mean, I guess it ISN""T as dark as the first but it's hardly some pussywillowed romp with superheroes either. It has real stakes and the themes are just as mature as they were in the first film.  Stuckmann said it best in his review. Some of the conversations in this film are very adult in theme and ideas. I was thinking the same thing while watching it. I thought the same thing he mentioned in his review ""I can totally see younger kids tuning out during those scenes."" And that's not a detriment either. Bird refuses to pander, and I admire him for that. 

I think it's kinda shallow and little disappointing people are like ""Where's all my disturbing content? Bob threatened to break a person in half in the first! There was an attempted suicide! I wanted more of that!"" Like really? Is THAT what you take away from the first film? It's supposed darkness? 

IDK, the Deavor's parents being gunned down in the night (which we mostly see) is pretty dark. There are also action scenes in this film that are properly intense and suspenseful, dare I say even more so than the original. The most intense part of the first film was easily the plane scene. Here, the entire hunt with Helen for the Screenslaver through a Gotham-esque cityscape was classic suspense played to the hilt and ensuing fight was actually somewhat brutal in its physicality. Also, the finale with the entire family trying to stop the boat reaches a fever pitch of intensity so high when it ended people in my audience audibly went ""Phew!"" Voyd trying to portal Helen onto the plane, Bob struggling with the propeller, Forzone trying to use his ice to slow the ship down, Helen getting loopy due to the high altitude...that's all legit action/thriller shit my friends. 

Idk, sometimes with highly anticipated sequels that reach a fever pitch like this one had - people not just expect them to be better than the first films (which they already find perfect) and if they aren't BETTER, that automatically means it's a massive letdown. I just - I'm not wired that way. I don't EXPECT anything -  at least nothing as concrete as ""This film is totally going to make me feel EXACTLY how the first one felt 14 years ago! I just know it! How could it not!?""

 I HOPE for a good film that can stand alongside the first. And that's what I got here.  I think when people start imposing these ridgid expectations to films they are bound to be disappointed. Every. Time. There is no rule a sequel HAS to be better, or even AS good as the original. A sequel not being as amazing as it's predecessor isn't a failure. It's not a bad thing. If the standard is ""It's has to be an A+ or nothing"" with no room for nuance...how is that fair? 
",8r7d6q
e0sl3cn,"it was a pretty fun movie, but it's hampered down by the excessive amount of footage that was obviously intended for trailer usage. scenes like that made up probably half of the movie.

i think Brad Bird was pressured into doing this, especially if this feeling i have about the movie being made in a short amount of time is true (""cut for trailers"" aside, there was this production babies list at the end that seemed awfully short, but maybe i'm just looking into that too much). it seems like what he wanted to make was closer to his mission impossible movie, but that just wasn't possible.

aside from that, i think that Disney really pushed for it to be under the 2 hour mark, a mark that animated movies are too scared of going over for some reason. everything resolves itself in at most 5 minutes, with there even being a generic court scene for no reason.

i'd still say it's worth seeing cause the characters are just that fun, but man were the trailer scenes tedious.",8r7d6q

I know Brad Bird said he was waiting to crack the story before he made this but it honestly felt like he made this just to make it. It has none of the urgency of the first film, and it‚Äôs worse because this one was longer.

Whatever, seems like people liked it. I just wish there was more to it. I did love hearing the Giacchino score again in a theater though. ",8r7d6q

Jack Jack's powers, toward the end, seemed to conveniently fit whatever the story needed.  Not enough to be a glaring problem buy eventually it felt like they were coming up with powers to get the family out of whatever problem arose. 

Secondly, while the action was definitely well-done, I thought the action from the first film was overall better.  Nothing in this movie felt as exciting or thrilling as the Dash chase from the first film. 

All that being said, this was s great movie and I really hope we eventually get a third movie. ",8r7d6q

Also, the timing of the Villain didn't really make sense because superheroes were probably never going to be legal if not for her. I guess if you waited Fourteen years for this movie you might be disappointed, but most of it made sense from a continuation perspective except how the villain's process of going for revenge really was her own undoing.

e197ohw,"Keeping it succinct: 6/10

TLDR; Great movie if I consider it independently. When I consider the franchise- very disappointed. 14 years (which, for probably 75% of this films target audience is either 75% to over 100% of their LIFETIME) was a long time to wait. I expected more.


1. The Pacing

The concept of reversing (or more importantly shattering) gender roles is clever, but not novel. From the trailers alone, a lot was understood about the disconnect between Mr. Incredible and his new role as ‚Äúthe stay at home father.‚Äù Some of the best moments were revealed in them making the entire mid-section of the film IMO, a drag. Getting a taste of the action one comes to expect in the very beginning left me hungry for some more exciting action throughout the rest of the film, which we didn‚Äôt really get a lot of.

Now at this point viewers would point out the 3 (or so) crime fighting scenes with Elastigirl. But unlike the first movie, where a constant excitement envelopes each scene, all of Elastigirls scenes were dull and underdeveloped.

A. Generic train scene with overused parachute transforming superpower

B. Amazing visual fight scene with Screenslaver, only to be rendered pointless when you find out its a Pizza Boy (and even more infuriating when you question how Elastigirl could even be mildly challenged by a scrawny pizza boy)

C. Pretty good rescue scene of the ambassador (I‚Äôll give you this one Brad).

Finally we reach the end. The point where the evil villains super plot comes to fruition. Where we expect to see the Supers brought to their knees. Where we at least wonder once: is it remotely possible they loose? At this point in the first, Syndrome had managed to make all Supers cowering with fear...questioning their own adequacy.

Brad rises to the challenge and dawns our favorite Supers in psychedelic goggles (the likes of which are found on $5 racks outside tourist attractions) and effectively gives the villain full control over an arsenal of heroes. 

Hell yeah.

Then minutes later fools the villain with Jack Jack inadvertently knocking one off- which leads to all of them getting them off in succession. The villain never saw this coming. Seriously? That‚Äôs it!?

But that brings me to my next point:

2. The Evil Plot and the Evil Techie

So, Evelyn wanted to rid the public perception of needing/supporting superheroes. Her father used them as a crutch and it cost her both her parents. Sure. I‚Äôm okay with that. A bit rich asking us to believe that? Yeah, but again, it‚Äôs simple enough for kids and digestible for adults.

However, when the movie starts, and Elastigirl is first cast for the mission to shift perception, Supers were already illegal and public perception was already at a low. Why would Evelyn spend the entire movie not only raising public perception but actually changing legislation with her brother, only to try and then fight against public perception and try and change legislation back?

Why not just use the hypnosis power from the start and destroy the future for superhero‚Äôs right at the train scene? Or perhaps even more of an opportune moment was to show her attacking the ambassador (that would lead to even more INTERNATIONAL outcry). Why follow this unbelievably convoluted path for a problem that already had a solution several times in the movie?

I can overlook this shortcoming of the villain, but what I simply cannot and will not overlook is the shoddy job of making her even remotely scary or intimidating.

A woman with a Tony Stark level grasp of technology and engineering, who has proven her abilities during the run time of the movie, is caught fighting bare handed at the end of the film against superheroes. What?!

Not even a cool laser gun? Not even a full-body version of the Screenslaver outfit to sort of recall the ‚Äúmain villain?‚Äù No cool nanotech body armor? No drones or robots? Nothing!?

Her entire evil plan hinges on dinky goggles working and an escape plane? Come on!!

This is my chief area of disappointment. We all love superhero movies for the heroes themselves. But they are left unfulfilled and empty without an equally impressive and equally considered nemesis. Incredibles 1 would never have been as successful as it was if the character of Syndrome was left as unimagined and unimpressive as Evelyn was.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts. I apologize if this comes off as all negative, I did love the film for many other reasons. But again as I mentioned before, if the films were released in opposite order, I would have no complaints, however, the franchise is better than this from a writing standpoint. The first was just as funny, just as clever, and just as wholesome as this one attempted to be. So to me, those aren‚Äôt reasons to overlook the lazy and rushed writing of this one.

e0p2v8n,The consensus with my family is the film was boring. I liked it but it did little to keep the kids attention who were literally falling asleep toward the end.

Like Bob obviously learns to check his ego.

Violet learns to.. be less harsh with her dad and just take care of the darn baby?

And Helen to...  what does the main character learn again?

Like the villian's ""Don't be a slave of technology and don't put your fate on the hands of others out of convinience and laziness"" seem to have little interlude with Elastigirl's arc. Which is to relax and trust her family more? .. I guess?",8r7d6q

I even planned a movie night for my youth group and we watched the first one together. I went to opening night yesterday with my girlfriend and man did we have a hoot. Although the antagonist was extremely more fleshed out in the first one, I believe I like the second one the most. I definitely laughed way more watching Incredibles 2, and it was awesome to see Jack Jack go ham with a raccoon. The animation is obviously better, and I love how they started right where we left off.

And kind of funny how its almost the same story of the first film and that is someone responds to a 'job' to be a superhero again only that the person who hires them is actually the villain and want to take revenge on them. The first film it was a lot more personal in that regard.

e0sno4m,"I felt like this movie suffered from 2 things.

1. Most of the jokes were shown off multiple times in the trailer (Cookies for Jack-Jack, ""Is she having adolescents"", ""Where are you going ASAP?!"", etc)

2. This movie was brought down by Pixar's belief that ""It's the Incredibles! Anything we do people will love!"" and that's about all the thought put into the story. 

The reason the first Incredibles shined was because it had lots of adult themes that were shown off in a way that was both funny and relatable, such as:

1. Helen thinking Bob was having an affair
2. Bob's midlife crisis
3. Fans taking something way too far based on a grudge against their ""hero""
4. Death.
5. The unknown of bringing a family into a non-family situation.
6. Torture. 

This movie had none of that heaviness. The ""Stay at home dad"" story felt more like a reason for feminist jokes. It felt very ""ha, look a man can't take care of kids."" which felt pandering. Another problem I had with the movie was how predictable it was. I mean come on, I had the ""twist"" figured out 30 minutes into the movie. I understand it's a kids movie but it's also a Pixar movie. They usually can throw in a good curve ball. 

This movie was honestly more spectical over substance than anything else. It's enough color pop for kids to love it. It has enough teen humor for millennials to love it. It has just enough mom/dad jokes to make older audiences love it.

However, if you're a fan of story and a fan of movies that are more than ""Hey, look NOSTALGIA!"" then you're probably gonna be pretty bored with this film. As a fan of the original and as someone who grew up with the original, I am disappointed with what happened. 

Pixar can just add this to the ""Movies we shouldn't have went back to"" pile with Finding Dory. 

P.S. There is very little Frozone in this movie. Like maybe 15 minutes worth. I think there is actually less of him than the first movie had honestly. The trailers are misleading as hell. ",8r7d6q
e0rm4d0,"edit: Sorry to all those on mobile. The table is very hard to read if you are not on a desktop.

Late to the party but here's a rundown of my thoughts.

Why was The Incredibles **great**, but The Incredibles 2 **just okay?**



 || The Incredibles | The Incredibles 2
---|---|---|----
**Bob** || Right in his midlife crisis, he turns to his superhero past to once again feel in control | Has to be the at-home-dad so that his wife can succeed, so that he can also be a superhero, and so that the children have a reliable parent
**Helen** || Has to deal with her husband's emotional unreliability and selfishness all the while keeping her family together | Has to be a good superhero so that superheroes can be legalized again and to support her family
**Violet**| | Troubled by her family's instability, having moved for the 3rd time, her father disinterested and her mother tired, just wanting to be normal | Wants to get with Tony whom she is infatuated with but cannot because of circumstances arising from being a super
**Dash**| | Wants to be super, or even just express himself through doing what he loves and is good at, but can't because of the need to be normal | Math
**Family Themes**| | A family needs honesty and trust, as shown by Helen leaving the kids to fend for themselves, Bob having to come clean to his family, and culminating in the Parrs fighting together | Bob finds that parenting is harder than being super? Helen works hard to support her family? The kids also have to deal with mundane life problems? A family must function as a unit? It's all over the place
**Risk** || Was it saving the world? No, it was **the family staying together** | Superheroes staying illegal
**Action** || Thrilling, well-placed, creative, and funny. It was very satisfying to finally see the Incredibles work together in cooperative ways. Each action scene directly progresses the plot | At times just like the first or even better (Screen Slaver scenes), at other times too long or not novel enough. Too many or too pointless action scenes may have diminished or diluted the weight of the others. Action is episodic (one not relating directly relating to the next, train, then ambassador, then tracking)
**Villain** || Syndrome: Campy, or cliche-but-cheekily-done, reminiscent of similar golden age of comic villains | Evelyn: Too serious and edgy plus unconvincing character motivations, even the fake Screen Slaver was way more interesting. Arguably even the Underminer (""Nothing is beneath me!"")
**Visual Theming** || 50s-60s modernism and consumerism, reinforcing the commentary on the American nuclear family and referencing the golden age of comic superheroes | An additional flavor of 50s-60s retrofuturism, absolutely stunning visual design, but what does it all mean or add?
**Personal Verdict** || 10/10 A timeless classic about family and superheroes | 7/10 An exciting action film, fun and novel

All in all, The Incredibles knew what it wanted to be and what it wanted to say. I find that every moment was essential and constructive to the themes. The Incredibles 2 felt a bit confused, all over the place, and lacking in cohesion. You could easily question why a scene was in the film, as some added meat to the plot and entertainment but no content to the overall themes. The Incredibles 2 conflict felt trite and constructed compared to the first film, simply because it lacked cohesion.

**TLDR: The Incredibles feels like a timeless classic and The Incredibles 2 feels like one regular episode in a long running cartoon series.**

My vision of Incredibles 2 would have been that the Screen Slaver is a real antagonist (again reminiscent of 50s-60s catalogue consumerism) with the family conflict being that Jack-Jack is uncontrollable and dangerous. Imagine giving a toddler, as selfish as any regular toddler, such a destructive arsenal of powers. Perhaps such a story could pair raising Jack-Jack, with Screen Slaver's disgust of a society that promotes greed and one-upmanship. I am definitely not as inventive or adept a storyteller as Brad Bird, but I think such a story would say more than this film did. Probably much harder to execute in a Pixar film however, but The Incredibles did it.",8r7d6q
e0u6y1n,"I was kinda underwhelmed. The animation is amazing of course, and it has the signature Pixar energy. But the plot was quite half baked, say what you will about plots in kids movies, but this one was just... not god.

Evelyn was just always off, and it wasn‚Äôt surprising at all that she was the baddie.

The final ‚Äúbattle‚Äù was a bit of a joke, the last one had the whole family being unified against syndrome and the giant robot. In this one.... they have to knock goggles off of super and steer a ship?

It was a fun movie for sure, but in my opinion is more of a Monsters University than a Toy Story 2. ",8r7d6q
e0x26d6,"So I‚Äôm a little bit late but I finally got around to seeing Incredibles 2. I really wanted to see it opening night or the sneak preview night because I‚Äôm a HUGE Pixar fanboy (I‚Äôve defended Brave in the past and the Toy Story trilogy are my favorite movies period, don‚Äôt fucking gatekeep me on that shit because I think those are some damn good credentials) and my parents kept putting it off day after day for whatever the daily excuse was (Hey, I haven‚Äôt gotten my license) so I just went ‚ÄúAlright, fuck y‚Äôall. I have my ticket money, I‚Äôm seeing this thing‚Äù so I called my best friend and we went together. Normally I‚Äôd skip on movies in theaters for financial reasons but Incredibles 2 means a ton to me because Incredibles is the first movie I can remember seeing in theaters at age 4 and now here I am as a legal adult watching the sequel. 

So what did I think? Incredibles 2 was good, not great and not among the must sees of Pixar. In terms of ‚ÄúPixar sequel totem pole‚Äù, I‚Äôd put it above every other Pixar sequel except for the Toy Story sequels with Finding Dory trailing behind this one. Coco was a much more impactful film overall (Just for a recent comparison) but I still had fun with this.

Let‚Äôs start with the good. 

I really like how it started right where Incredibles 1 left off, too many sequels do that ‚Äúone/five/ten years later‚Äù bullshit so you have to piece everything together in some headcanon. It made everything fall into place so you could seamlessly transition from 1 to 2 if you felt like holding a double feature. 

I like how they kept everybody ‚Äúin-character‚Äù per say. A lot of sequels have a problem of making characters completely change personalities or jumping the shark because it‚Äôs been so many years since the original. Mr. Incredible is still a selfish father that puts himself over everybody else (Which caused Syndrome, need I remind you), Ms. Incredible is still the straight (wo)man, Violet is still the shy yet boy-crazy girl we knew from the first, Dash is still an over and under-achiever at the same time and Jack-Jack is‚Ä¶..Jack-Jack. It doesn‚Äôt disrespect the audience for paying attention to the first film in order to appease a newer fanbase and I appreciate that.

>!I think the action in this was more fun than the original, it felt more varied than ‚ÄúThis dude with flying boots and a laser plus big droids that shoot lasers and flail tentacles‚Äù due to the Screenslaver and the brainwashed new recruit Supers. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the action in Incredibles 1 was still pretty damn good but I just feel like this had more variety to it.<

The music is perfection for a superhero flick and the movie looks so goddamn pretty, not in a Coco or Finding Nemo/Dory kind of way but like it looks real enough that you could touch it but it‚Äôs also cartoonish enough to not hit that uncanny valley type shit. 

I like how they focused this flick on Elastagirl. Another Mr. Incredible flick wouldn‚Äôt have been as interesting and it‚Äôs a nice change of pace.

>!I‚Äôm glad that this concluded the whole Incredibles story in a pretty solid way. Incredibles 1 and 2 can be read as a story about racism given the prejudices against Supers and having to live underground and keep who you really are under wraps (Much like X-Men being about civil rights) and given how Supers were legalized in the end, there isn‚Äôt much more for the team to accomplish without jumping the shark. Sure, it did sort of end of a cliffhanger with them going over bank robbers but that wasn‚Äôt anywhere near as big of a deal as the Underminer was as that clearly hinted at a sequel. If Pixar is seriously considering an end to this era of Pixar with Toy Story 4 and bringing on a new host of originals, they need to wrap their franchises up and I think they did a good enough job with 2‚Äôs ending. Most Pixar movies don‚Äôt really need a sequel though as they tell their story in one sitting like Up or Coco.<

Now for the bad.

>!Screenslaver isn‚Äôt nearly as compelling of a villain as Syndrome was. Did Screenslaver have cooler ‚Äúpowers‚Äù? Absolutely. Was Screenslaver a more compelling character? Fuck NO. The thing with Incredibles 2 that really irks me is that I knew from the first few seconds of the businessman talking to the Incredibles about this supposed wonder corporation that‚Äôs gonna MAKE SUPERS LEGAL AGAIN that ‚ÄúOh, these fucking guys are the villain‚Äù because it was clearly too good to be true. It completely kills the suspense in your supposed mystery villain. At first I thought Frozone would turn on them given the frame of the promo pictures of Screenslaver but once they took the mask off the brainwashed dude, I went ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the head honchos, isn‚Äôt it.‚Äù. When the lady walked in the room with two glasses of booze for Elastigirl, I went ‚ÄúWhoop dee doo, I know where this is going‚Äù. It‚Äôs so painfully obvious from just the first few minutes of these characters getting introduced. They had such a brilliant idea for a villain that brainwashes people through screens that wants to rid the world of Supers out of their prejudices and anecdotes and they wasted that potential on a blatantly obvious ‚Äúplot twist‚Äù. Syndrome was more compelling as he had motivations behind his actions (Mr. Incredible being arrogant and scrubbing him off even though Syndrome had good intentions in the beginning) and was an overall more fleshed out character. It was more compelling to watch him grow as a character as Mirage turned her back on him and he tried to use the Omnibots to sell his shit compared to an eye-rollingly obvious twist that just makes you go ‚ÄúGee, I just can‚Äôt figure out who the big bad guy of this whole thing is. Could it possibly be the girl and guy that‚Äôs been buttering the team up with too good to be true promises for this whole thing? Say it ain‚Äôt so!‚Äù. They could‚Äôve done some crazy shit with this guy but they wasted it. Damn shame. Maybe I‚Äôm just a dumbass but I didn‚Äôt see Hector being Miguel‚Äôs true great great grandpa in Coco from a mile away and yet this was so painfully obvious.<

>!You know, for all of the screentime Jack-Jack took up, you‚Äôd think he would‚Äôve played a much more significant role in the climax. Instead he was just a short cameo compared to Dash and Violet taking down the brainwashed dudes and eventually Screenslaver herself. No, instead he‚Äôs just a damn comedy act that starts cute but gets more and more obnoxious as it goes on because it takes up a significant portion of the movie that could‚Äôve been utilized to build up Screenslaver or Elastigirl or the prejudice against Supers or something with more substance than slapstick (By the way, humor wise I still think Incredibles 1 had better writing. The timing in that movie was perfect) to make the 40 something year old mommies in the audience laugh. Sully and Boo‚Äôs relationship in ‚ÄòMonsters, Inc.‚Äô felt so much more genuine because it knew when to be funny and when to be serious, this just tried to go 100% in the funny direction and that just doesn‚Äôt work because then the audience isn‚Äôt invested in the characters because all they know them for is some meme they saw online (Which is a shame because Pixar is usually exceptionally good at writing believable characters that the audience can empathize with. Mr. Fredrickson, Sully, the toys in general in Toy Story, Miguel, etc. They all worked because they knew when to make the audience and laugh and when to tear them the fuck down.<

>!My verdict is that it‚Äôs just good. I don‚Äôt know whether to give this a 3.5/5 or a 4/5, it‚Äôs probably a 3.5 movie that gets the added half because it‚Äôs a really nice local theater. I know it sounds like I just shat on this thing and I think it‚Äôs the worst thing ever but trust me, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad film, it‚Äôs just not great or a must see either. There‚Äôs a lot to like here but those two major flaws in the plot hold it back from being something truly great and due to that, I can‚Äôt really say that I‚Äôd buy this on DVD/Blu-Ray for full price (Meanwhile I bought Coco on DVD within the first week. I had to have that fucking movie in my collection), I might buy it if I see it in the bargain bin for $5 or less but nah, I‚Äôm gonna pass on it otherwise. It‚Äôs stuck in a Hell of ‚ÄúGood but not good enough to want to rewatch it time and time again‚Äù so it‚Äôll probably be forgotten in the cracks of time much like how people forgot stuff like Monsters University and Finding Dory existed (Though Finding Dory was decent, just not good enough to be really memorable). Incredibles 1 was better but this was still good enough for what it‚Äôs worth (Incredibles was never a high art animated franchise, it was a KUHRAYZUH 60s comics era action-comedy flick so I don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôd be necessary to turn this into some philosophical shit to please the target audience, though like I said I wish the characters were more fleshed out because Pixar is exceptionally good at it when given the opportunity) if you were a fan of the original. If you weren‚Äôt a fan of the original, this won‚Äôt do anything to change your mind on it because it‚Äôs basically ‚ÄúIncredibles but more of it with a worse plot but better action and arguably better comedy given your sense of humor‚Äù. If you‚Äôre a fan of the Incredibles, go see it. If you haven‚Äôt seen the original Incredibles, go watch that before you see this because there‚Äôs a bunch of stuff that is depending on you having knowledge of the original. If you‚Äôre not a fan of the Incredibles, don‚Äôt watch it because it won‚Äôt do anything for you because it doesn‚Äôt radically change the formula. I had a good time with it even though it sounds like I just ripped this thing to shreds so it wasn‚Äôt a waste of my $10.<

Even though I don‚Äôt think Incredibles 2 was as good as it could‚Äôve been (Though again, I still think it‚Äôs good), I‚Äôm still optimistic about Toy Story 4. If they‚Äôre serious about this whole ‚Äúend of an era‚Äù thing and want to wrap up Toy Story for good, I doubt they‚Äôd screw their most well known franchise with a half-assed sequel.",8r7d6q
e121538,"Great movie, but I'm left with one lingering question: Why was Mr. Incredible and then Elastigirl both so shocked that Jack Jack had powers? They had both seen the baby transform when they rescued him from Syndrome and surely heard the babysitter's report about his ""special needs.""  Just seemed like their knowing of his powers was already an established fact from the first movie.",8r7d6q
e0sxl3h,"I give it a 4/10. It lacked everything that made the first installment, and movies in general fun to watch. 

Firstly, they didn't even try with show not tell. This alone is why the villian sucked. The villian and her brother just told you their motivations. It made it impossible to give a shit about her because there was no emotional attachment. At least with syndrome, you could feel bad for him and understand him.

Besides Bob, none of the characters got any development. They started and ended at the exact same place. One of the best things about the first movie was not only the struggle to beat the villian, but the struggle to keep their marriage and family intact. At the start, the Par family was somewhat divided, and had different ideas about how things should be run. By the end, they came together as a family. This kind of plot is what makes characters interesting. Incredibles 2 lacked any of it.

Those are my major complaints but I also have a few minor ones. For instance, I could tell that the voice actors aged quite a bit. Bob sounded like a Grandpa. There are also some plot holes, but I am willing to forgive those, because in the end it is a children's movie.

I think that the movie should have been set in the future. Having it pick up right after the first one severely limited their options. I have my own ideas of how the movie should have been written, but I'm not a written so I'll keep them to my self.

TLDR: Lacked show not tell, villian was bad, little character development, should have been set in the future.",8r7d6q
e0p3uht,[removed],8r7d6q
e19ytdh,"7/10, largely because of just how great the first one was. 

My biggest issue was with the predictability of the villain. Some people attribute that to this being a ""kids"" movie, but I would say that Syndrome's revelation in the original was much less obvious.  With all of today's concerns about the media, it was not a huge leap to expect that this big media partnership would hold the potential for abuse and exploitation. 


Secondly, no one else seems to have noticed this, but I was distracted by the similarity between Syndrome's voice and Winston's voice. Might just be me. 

Additionally, I thought Winston's sister, Evelyn, reminded me a lot of the anchorwoman from Megamind. She also was a bit reminiscent of Syndrome's assistant as well. Again, might only be me. 

Overall, the film could've been a bit more original, but I enjoyed a lot of it. The Incredibles themselves were generally very likable and relatable. 
Bonus points for Bao, but the eating scene did throw me off a bit as far as metaphorical continuity goes. Still great. ",8r7d6q
e0rjqqb,"I just saw The Incredibles 2. It was pretty enjoyable, a freshing and familiar throwback to days gone by.

I don't think it should be marketed as a children's movie however, as there are a few scenes that make me think that the PG rating wasn't quite right, such as the scene where Mr Incredible calls a coloured gentleman the N-word, and then then went on a 15 minute, explosive and explicit rant on how black people contribute the most to gun violence statistics in the United States. Yeah, not sure what the director was thinking.

Another odd scene was in the final battle between the Incredible family and the Underminer. The Underminer knocks over an embassy of a middle eastern country, and turns to screen and roars 'SYRIA IS ISREAL' , which was a little off, but only made stranger by the fact that he repeated it for 13 and a half minutes. Guess they just ran out of lines idk.

Speaking of running out of lines, the scene where Mr Incredible lynches Frozone didn't need to last 20 minutes. It was pretty graphic as well.

Overall, it was enjoyable, 7/10",8r7d6q
e0wt1r8,"Did anybody sense some sexual tension between Elastigirl and Evelyn? I did from when they first met, and then when Elastigirl mentioned that she had a mohawk... and then they kept having alone time. I was so distracted by it I did not expect her to be the Screenslaver- but I thought Winston was. ",8r7d6q
e0pc8x4,"If I had to sum up the movie in one word: exasperating.

I was just worn down and worked over by this movie. Too many arguments, too much frenzy and fervor... it just didn't feel like very much fun at all. I'm pretty disappointed right now, because the first Incredibles movie is my second favorite Pixar movie ever.

From Dash yelling about the vegetables, to Violet yelling about... well, everything, and then the yelling from other characters... it all felt really argumentative and hectic and unpleasant. Sure, maybe they intended for that to be the environment that Bob had to deal with, but it just carried over to me in the audience and the movie never really gave me enough joy and other happy stuff to make up for it. 

The villain was a dud. As soon as you saw the backstory with the death of the parents, it was obvious that Odenkirk or his sister were going to be the villains. No surprise there. And uhhh... the interactions between them didn't excite me or bring anything new. It was just this crazy female villain who wanted to frame the heroes. Nothing special to say.

The other new heroes they introduced were all generic and forgettable as well. I mean, the Void girl basically just had the powers of Portal. That's... kinda old. I guess someone over at Pixar finally got around to playing Portal 1 and 2. And then there was some hideous she-hulk looking thing that I think might've been female, but maybe wasn't. I dunno. Something odd about that one.

I suppose the most stimulating thing about the movie is Elastigirl's giant ass. My God, that thing was titanic. What a sight to behold.

Very, very sad to write all this down. I'm just worn down and tired and it feels like I've gone on an unpleasant marathon. The magic from the first Incredibles is just gone. I'm spent. ",8r7d6q
e0rco73,"I loved Incredibles 1, which is why I couldn‚Äôt have been more disappointed in this movie. The writing was unfunny, predictable, and overall unenjoyable. I don‚Äôt think I cracked a smile once the whole time. The scenes that were supposed to be the funniest just seemed kind of dumb, like the raccoon fight everyone is so enamored by. The characters were obnoxious and insufferable, particularly Dash and Jack Jack. Many characters were seemingly added with no explanation whatsoever and for seemingly little or no reason, like all the new heroes, who almost seemed like they were from a different movie. I saw the ending coming at the very beginning of the movie when the characters were first introduced. This movie just dragged on and on because so many of the scenes were similar and didn‚Äôt keep enough focus. It didn‚Äôt seem to progress at all until the very end. Even when the end came, there was little or no payoff because it was *exactly* how I thought it would be for the two whole hours before it happened. This movie should also have been about 30 minutes shorter. 

Overall, I couldn't find much to like about this movie, but I really wanted to love this movie. All the things I really love about the first one were far less or even absent in this movie. For example, the soundtrack seemed a lot less big in this movie compared to the fat, swinging brass of the first. Maybe there were a couple moments like that, but mostly it seemed way cut back and simplified. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever liked a Disney film less than I liked this one. Disney waited so long for this cash grab, the voices have changed. The Disney short beforehand was also my least favorite one yet. I waited 14 years for this movie and I hate it. 

I know a lot of people really enjoyed the film, which is cool, but I'm not sure what I expected sharing my thoughts on it",8r7d6q

e0res8t,"While I over all really enjoyed the film I think during the third act I started to feel like there were... problems, I guess? I can go on and on about a lot of the amazing moments, like the train chase or Edna's scenes, but so many people probably agree that those were the highlights. 

Here are some of the issues I had, especially in the third act.

1. Violet didn't really get much outside her B plot. She had a few moments of cool power usage but in the climax she mostly stood around. Considering that her powers have so much potential it seems like she was kind of wasted. I realize that she's a more shy and subtle character, but it really felt like she vanished from the actioooooooooooooooh I see what they did. Still not a fan.

2. There were little super fights in the end but I really was hoping that we'd get a big one where the family all fought together like they did in the first. We actually see very little of the Parrs fighting crime together, which is mostly because of

3. Jack-Jack. I'll admit that early on his moments were funny and creative and I get what they were going for, but man did they need to shoo him out in the third act. The jokes started to get overplayed and the cast still had to have someone on baby monitor duty even in the midst of the action. He kind of became the load and I would have preferred he just stay at Edna's.

The villain wasn't Syndrome but it's kind of hard to match that. They were serviceable and I enjoyed them for what they were. Overall the first half of the film was more fun and more compelling than the second half was. I don't think I'll see it again in theaters but I will definitely pick it up when it hits digital.

What if Screenslaver was just playing the part of a simple corny 60's harmless villain on television but was actually able to control Elastigirl behind the scenes somehow, to turn her into a violent superhero who's really going into overkill?

I think my main issue with the movie was the villain. I think this is primarily due to the lack of screen time.

e11pw9m,"Honestly, I liked a lot about it, but great swathes of the film left me cold.  A few sequences felt completely lifeless and flat somehow. I thought all the new supers were lame in one way or another, when you compare them to the old NSA dudes like Gazerbeam, although I guess the whole point is that they‚Äôll grow into the icons that their predecessors were. Would be cool to see a more professional Voyd in the future. Didn‚Äôt seem to be as effortlessly perfect as the first movie was, it felt laboured and disjointed to me. Edna Mode scene was top notch, though. 

Just me who feels like the animation, particularly in the opening scene, felt like a downgrade from the first film? To be fair, I was a kid when the first one was out, so perhaps now I‚Äôm just less likely to be totally immersed in a movie‚Äôs visuals. I had the same problem with Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, so maybe it‚Äôs just something I‚Äôm experiencing when I go to the cinema as of late. ",8r7d6q

e144zoa,"Underwhelmed. 14 years and the director saying he needed time to make it perfect makes me think he fluked the first one. Compare it to the first and how memorable some scenes were: the aeroplane scene, mr incredible vs the giant circle thing, the end scene, dash running on water, when they all came together. What does this one have?

But my biggest issue is the villain. A bowl of nothing. Her scheme is to make heroes illegal when at the start of the film politicians were already hoping to make them illegal? I know logic isn't really supposed to be here, but like, gee i dunno bribe a politician. Compare it to sydrome. He was fustrated at the hand that he was given and brushed away. So he made something of himself, he proved mr incredible wrong. This chick was just boring. No depth. Just ""I'm smart"". Wow, so compelling. 

And can we talk about how this sequel added no memorable characters? The new super group looked like they were supposed to be in big hero 6 or something. And no one else was interesting. Just milked the old ones which was fine.

The best scenes were the one's where they were at home juts being a family. The rest was just over the top action scenes. Also the whole point of the first was mr incredible can't be a hero alone. He needs his family. So in this one helen goes away without family to learn that she does indeed need family. Felt redundant.

One more sidenote. I thought this was gonna be a two hour feminism ride. But it wasn't, never felt forced imo. But why is a line like ""even a man can use it"" fine? I know it's a joke. But come one, what a double standard.

PROS:

\-The Story: The story was really solid and never did it really feel like it was cashing in on the first film.

\-Action

\-Voice Cast

\-Animation

The film also did a great job of handling all the characters. 

CONS:

\-The villain isn't bad, but just not as good as the first.

But the sequel's more action packed and the graphics have vastly improved so there's that. Personally, I don't think Jack-Jack was the highlight of the movie. For me it was Mr.Incredible trying to be a good dad. I honestly enjoyed 'Mr.Incredible's bad attempt at father' scenes more than Elastigirl's action sequences, not to say they weren't amazing(felt like spiderman action sequences with her stretching her arms like webs)

As for Jack-Jack, I liked that they didn't entirely rely on his op-ness to solve every issue, but rather have him play one critical role in pulling off the goggles first of Elastigirl. Everyone else's instincts would have been to use brute force to try to take off the mask, but Jack-Jack, albeit telekinesis, had the intention of simply wanting to get a better look at his mother. Pureness over brute force.

Also wished there was more Dash scenes, but he did get all the best scenes in the 1st one so it's fair Violet and Elastigirl get more deserved spotlight.

Overall, a sequel that's very well made, although I would have liked it much more with a little bit of tweaks on the villain and plot points(I couldn't figure out the overarching message).

e0ug2lq,"I have little energy to complain seeing lots of people around me happy about it, I guess it's stockholm SYNDROME since we waited 14 years for this. It's The Last Jedi all over again, I see it and think ""People will defend this.."" and lose all will to fight.

But it was dissappointing. I think at 2/3 of the movie it finally clicked for me ""This is a safe movie.. safe.. safe.."". I just knew nothing truly exciting would happen on the film and I just had to sit there until it ended, accurately predicting everything that was gonna happen. It was predictable except for the main baddy being the sister but that was a coin toss. 

The Screensaver should have been his own character, I even thought it was a genius move that he hypnotized himself to forget about everything so they couldn't extract info from him and I thought his last plan was already set in motion to destroy the cruiser. 
Really, we pretty much had no villain here for a final fight and that annoys me. It's like a badly done Civil War without the Ironman vs Cap scene. Our climax could have been a fight against the possessed heroes, maybe Robert vs Helen, but they got their glasses off with no difficulty and the real climax was stopping a ship. After stopping a train after stopping a giant drill.

And Jack was overdone but that's another can of worms, I would tolerate bad humor if the main plotline was strong enough but instead it lacked PUNCH. It wasn't sad, and it wasn't hype either, it was just average and I don't buy it that the guy behind this waited 14 years to make the best possible sequel, I think whatever he would have written 2 or 3 years after airing the original Incredibles would have been better than this while he still had the movie fresh on his mind.

6/10, of course it looks good so I can't give it less, but it pains me that this movie was supposed to be a milestone in animation like Coco or Inside-Out and it instead was a forgettable popcorn flick. By the end of the movie I had to focus really hard to follow the action since my mind was already numbed by everything going on like those Transformer movies.",8r7d6q

e0p6v4x,"I saw it as a double feature last night and I'm surely in the minority here but I was let down by this movie especially when comparing it to the first one. Probably my biggest issue with it was how cartoony it seemed. Obviously its an animated movie (the animation is by far the one of the most impressive aspects of this movie) but the first film did a great job of making all of the characters feel authentic with real emotions and depth to them. However, in this one the characters come off as very one-dimensional. 

In this movie, Bob struggles with a sense emasculation because of how Elastigirl is picked as the one to be the face of the supers and he is forced to be at home and take care of the kids. While I think this is a great conflict for him to have the movie uses his frustrations over this for laughs rather than respecting him as a character and the conflict never pays off in any satisfying way. Similarly, Violet as a character has gone backwards as at the end of the first one she becomes less self-conscious and more self-assured, while in Incredibles 2 Dicker erases Tony's memory and all of her character growth from the first one has seemingly been erased as well. Again, as with Bob's, Violet's conflict is played for laughs most of the time.

Additionally, while I'm fine with Jack Jack getting screen time I felt like he was at times too much of a distraction. The fight scene with the raccoon went on for far too long in my opinion. The villain was incredibly forgettable as well. The other supers, while some of their powers were cool were just so distractingly outlandish that it detracted from my experience.

However to the film's credit there were some funny moments and fun action scenes, the standout being when Elastigirl infiltrating the decoy Screenslaver's apartment. Overall not a bad movie and I'm sure kids will have a blast with it, but it was a definite step-down in quality from the first Incredibles movie.",8r7d6q

Screenslaver was awful.  Like, predictably aside, the motivation I thought that he had been hired to create scenarios that are dangerous enough to require heroes but winnable enough so that heroes can get good publicity.  The actual agenda was way lamer.

Action was good at points.  There were 3 runaway vehicles in this movie and I didn't even enjoy the first one.  Voyd was outstanding to watch and if they make a third I want her in it.

The family stuff was good, yeah, but it really didn't feel like it went anywhere.

Like, it's down there with Finding Dory and Wall-E (mind you I like both) for me for Pixar movies I will forget about next week.

Apparently in this world, if you're in trouble, your only two options are to call a superhero or go into one of those panic rooms we all have. The villain's plan is almost 100% telegraphed as is who the villain turns out to be.

I liked Frozone getting more screen time,

My biggest problem with the film did not ruin it, but it kept it from being a sequel that could have exceeded the original. Remember in the original when Ms. Incredible tells her kids that ""this isn't like those cartoons. These people will kill you."" This movie felt like those cartoons. When the Racoon Jack Jack fought showed anthropomorphic traits the movie lost that realism, and it continued to lack it with a cartoony villain with a cartoony defeat. The villians 'motivation, though somewhat more than 1 dimensional, was not nearly relatable as the well set up Syndrome plot; it felt like a villain of the week deal. 

We see Mr.Incredible dealing with Jack Jack's sporadic and dangerous powers, stressing out, but next scene he takes him in public to a restaurant, completely fine.

None of these things make the movie bad. The raccoon fight was hilarious and I loved every second, but moments like that held the movie back from being as good as the first. Granted the opening sequence of the first, as well as the ending, did feel cartoony (bomb voyage, underminer, etc.) but the meat of the movie was a tense and real adventure with death, drama, and excellent pacing.

I still liked it, and if you loved it, awesome! **These are just my thoughts and if you loved it then those are your thoughts and that‚Äôs just as valid.**

Stuff I Liked-

-Edna and Jack Jack‚Äôs interactions were so good. I loved this shit.
-Bob at home. The one scene with him and Violet really made the whole subplot pay off well.
-The action and animation. Both amazing and beautiful, great details in stuff like Violet snorting out water from her nose and so on.
-Frozone! Loved seeing so much of him in this one, really balance out the movie for me. 


Stuff I Didn‚Äôt Like-

-I found the villain to be extremely weak. I didn‚Äôt NOT like her motivation, but it was glossed over and ignored far too quickly. As a result, when the climax came, I didn‚Äôt feel nearly as much intensity as I did with Syndrome in the first movie, because I wasn‚Äôt as invested in her as a character/villain. This made the Elastigirl plot sadly not work for me halfway through, which severely hurts the movie for me overall.

-Just a tad too much Jack Jack for my taste. He worked well in the home scenes with Bob, so I loved that aspect, but his participation in the final sequence was a little bit too much for me. It‚Äôs like having a companion in a video game that keeps dying; no matter how cool they are, if they keep dying you‚Äôre going to see them as a burden and annoying. With Violet looking for Jack Jack after leaving him with Dash, it felt like a retread of humor from the entire first half of the film. I just ended up wishing that they had left him at home, but I know I am completely alone in that sentiment as well.

Mixed-

-This is insanely nitpicky so I won‚Äôt count it as a con, but the music seemed a little over the top in some sequences; during action scenes it worked really well, but the big stand out moment of the music being way too much was the scene where Dash messes around with the house controls. Felt really out of place. 


These are just my thoughts, and I‚Äôm expecting to be downvoted into oblivion for it. I hope that some took the time to read this. Hope everyone enjoyed the movie! ",8r7d6q

e0rpnbn,"EASTER EGGS NOBODY'S TALKED ABOUT YET:

Riley's Dad from Inside Out was inside the building when Elastigirl chased the ""Screenslaver"" outside to catch him, around the same moment when she bumps into the civillian and apologizes.

Hidden Mickey made out of Hypnotism charts in Screenslaver's secret hideaway.

NOW, THE BIG SET-UP NOBODY'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT: Syndrome's return!
In the movie, we get hints of Syndrome either being alive, or his influence pushing our villain further. Early on in the film, the Deavors mention that the house they're lending the Parrs is one of many owned by a billionare. And um, last I checked-- lots of remotes, water that splits down the middle like the lavafall in the first movie-- it feels like it could very well have belonged to Syndrome a little bit back.
Also, Evelyn mentions that she wasn't the sole person responsible for the Screenslaver. A lot of the ideas for the Screenslaver himself were hers, though. Which makes me wonder if Syndrome either A. survived the jet chopping/explosion and worked with Evelyn, or B. worked with Evelyn prior to the events of the first film, as sort of a backup plan. I waited for a post credits scene to confirm this, but only saw a brief moment of an Underminer drill moving past the screen. Obviously, if there's an Incredibles 3, we know John Ratzenberger will be back, but now we know he would be reprising his Underminer role specifically.",8r7d6q
e1fb4y9,"I felt it was like maybe a 6.8 to 7.2 out of 10. Kinda sorta underwhelming and mainly fan service that they even made a sequel. I loved the underminer scenes better than 90% of the movie.

There was fun action scenes with good animation, but the best parts of the movie are jack-jack and Mr. incredible being a dad. The rest is really predictable and cliche, doesn't have any depth to it and a convoluted villain that just doesn't do much besides put hypno goggles on people. The apartment scene was the best in the movie, and then after the reveal of the villain who was preditable, she has a weak plan with no backup or anything interesting. Its literally a boat crash, she could've just blown everyone up or something since they already had 2 vehicle stoppage scenes already

e0repjm,"Hella weak plot, Jackjack and edna is life",8r7d6q
e0rziue,"The main issue I had with Incredibles 2 was the villain motivation. It just didn't make sense to me.

Spoilers:
Firstly, near the beginning of the movie the police/government officials mentioned how the super heroes sometimes inadvertently cause more harm when they try to help than if they didn't do anything. That was a really compelling argument that was never really addressed or solved. The characters simply said something along the lines of ""well sometimes you just have to do good"". That's not a good enough explanation.

Secondly, the motivation of the villain was hypocritical in a sense. She criticizes her brother for trying to bring the super heroes back. She believes he wants to do it because he equates the loss of his father with the banning of super heroes. That logic doesn't really work. However, the female villain on the other hand has reasoning that follows the same kind of flawed logic. She looks at the death of her father, his reliance on superheroes, and their failure to save him as a justification for keeping superheroes banned. That is the same flawed logic as her brother, which is something she criticized. 

The argument that the government officials present is way more interesting and it actually makes sense. The villain's justification is narrow and blatantly hypocritical. Her motivation would have been fine, if she did not point out the flawed logic of her brother. But the fact that she points that out and then blatantly makes the same mistake is just stupid. It's boring and it made me lose interest. It almost equates to the villains in marvel movies that just want to ""take over the world"" or ""be evil"". There's little substance there.


Now obviously it is supposed to be a kid's movie, but I don't think that can excuse it from lazy writing, especially when they've had 14 years. There are plenty of kid's movies that have deeper themes or villain motivations.

Either way, I'm assuming this was a deal for Bird where he'll get funding for some pet project later on. This really feels like he kind of just showed up to his dayjob and did his work and not ""I really loved this and took 14 years to come up with a good story"".",8r7d6q

The dialogue was really bad in several places, with characters just a little too blatantly sitting around mouthpiecing the writer's talking points. This really caused a significang amount of drag in the first two acts, especially considering how closely the ""camera work"" mimicked your standard alternating shots method. Made it feel like a tv drama, not a dynamic, comicsy setting. None of the new supers were really developed, and the time spent on jack jacks powers were unnecessary considering we already knew them thanks to the previous movie.

By having no time skip (literally none since it takes place seconds after the 1st film) it's kinda hard to make the character change or have an arc without affecting the 1st film. Dash became this OCD asshole (try to shoot rockets at some guys house? wtf ure smarter than that dash) Violet becomes this insecure obsessed crazy teenager girl (kinda ruins her arc in the 1st film), Mr Incredible a clumsy/dumb superhero? Didn't he infiltrated syndrome's base without being detected, did some clever tactics too, and even threw a rock at a guard miles away? he became this clever superman who doesnt just solve problem with his strength but with his wits to just some hero who punches through stuffs and tumbles over. Lastly, did everyone in the city just forgot the incredibles saved the city from a giant robot?? The government makes no sense here, so what if the police stopped the underminer? would they just say just let him steal the bank and make a giant earthquake cus we got insurance? what.

The whole reason they even did this no time skip thing is just so that they would show this ""cute"" scenes of Jackjack showing his powers for the first time. ugh


Don't get me started on the plot/story/villain. Lazy, predictable, Boring. 


Maybe I'm being too harsh on this kids movie but this is Pixar, master of animation. And the legendary Brad Bird, the guy worked on the simpsons and also made 2 of my favourite movies of its year (Ratatouille and Mission Impossible 4). This movie had so much potential.

e123mjt,"The plot was incredibly, incredibly predictable. Because the list of (non-disposable) cast members is so tight and we don't see any other characters (the other supers) until the main plot is already underway, the villain's identity is obvious. >!Hearing the phrase ""communications company"" followed by the villain's anger at her father's safe room gave it away before the villain even appeared. The other supers (with the slight exception of Voyd) were never anything more than the Vuvalini in Mad Max 4 (fighter characters who only exist to extend the length of conflict) !<Because the cast is so tight and family scenes are often over extended, a there's not a single moment of actual bad guy fighting (Bomb Voyage). Despite Dever's speech on the plane, Elastigirl never actually fights low level crime. She never works her way back up the ranks before facing a supervillain. After a 14 year cliffhanger, Underminer is a forgotten, disposable annoyance.

I wish the villain's motivations had been different. We never learn what happened to all the villains after the illegalization of supers. It would have been much more interesting if the government had them all killed or mindwiped. >!It would have been clever if Screenslaver was a manufactured villain specifically made to fight Elastigirl to push for the releaglization of supers but was otherwise a non-threat, as though it was all performance art. Then, after legalization, do a dreaded liar revealed where the Deavers want to use the supers as glorified mercenaries!<. Instead the bad guy's motivation comes down to r/PhonesAreBad

Other than that, some of the animation didn't look great (Jack Jack on fire, new heroes, Violet eye bags, Screenslaver fight). >!Also, the kids acted like idiots when they fought the other supers. They knew the goggles were causing them to be hostile, but they didn't take any of them off after knocking out all of them. !<

Also, I perceived there to be an overarching problem with Bao. The metaphor doesn't quite work unless we are seeing through the eyes of the mother. The bao child \*IS\* vulnerable. >!Getting hit by the soccer ball smushes its head.!< Because of that, we view the bao as vulnerable because physical activity will literally kill it.

The family stuff is sweet, but c'mon just too much of it. I realize it was only about 10 minutes longer than the first but.....idk the first just kept the action moving and paced so much better than the second.

e0rdlnm,"The best part of this movie was Elastigirl's sweet, sweet, milky tits. ",8r7d6q
e0ugbv0,"Overall, it was a good movie although I have a feeling that this is perhaps more so due to it being a sequel to an exceptionally good movie that was well beloved and much anticipated. 

That said like everyone else has stated, it suffered from a flawed villian. In addition, the story was also copy and paste. It felt like an agonizing rehashing of the first movie in so many ways. 

One more thing, I am not Ok with the notion that Mr. Incredible was messy and that was why he needed to be benched. Mr. Incredible often did what was necessary to save lives given the circumstance. Super hero work is not a competition, it is a job with serious consquences. I know it is a kid's movie and we probably aren't supposed to take that so seriously. It just seemed like the writers were trying very hard to go for a justification for making Elastigirl the main player for the movie. The justification they ended up choosing didn't seem very good to me, which makes me sad.

When I watched the first movie, I was maybe 15? I didn't quite get all the themes and deeper meanings. I have watched it several times after, and I have to say that I saw this movie as the story of middle aged white man having to juggle the responsibilities of raising a family while having the tedious and much-underappreciated job of being an undercover superhero. Yes, he is a family man, but the movie wasn't ultimately about his family per se. It was about him, and his struggles of having to balance all his responsibilities. 
My point is, I have expectations regarding the theme and prevailing narrative established in the first movie, and was a tad bit disappointed when the whole thing is turned on its head 14 years later in what to me seems like an attempt to appease the growing dissatisfaction of a domestic audience that is part of a rapidly evolving socio-cultural atmosphere.  I guess what I am really trying to say is where in the first movie, Brad Bird had complete freedom to follow his creative vision and it shined through, In this movie, it seemed like he was handed a list with checkboxes  to check off while making the movie. The movie seemed rush in certain ways, with several plotpoints that were introduced and dropped. The third act felt more rushed than it needed to be. Mr. Incredible does nothing actiony in the movie aside from the beginning and at the very end. This made me sad. 

I might get get downvoted because I know I sound anti SJW or maybe even anti-feminist. But this is an honest opinion. I am not against superhero movies with strong female leads or even just female leads with no make counter parts. What I don't like is when movie directors and makers are strong armed into taking already established successful movies/stories, and then remaking them with the exact same story, except with a female lead. Movies like Ocean's 8 and Ghostbusters come to mind. I feel it is weak and it is wrong, and that is not the direction we should be going.
",8r7d6q
e0v36nv,"after watching the movie i realised that it was indeed a cash grab instead of a ""story Brad Bird finally found worthy"".

e0uxbkn,Sorry if this has been discussed already but the whole not knowing that Jack Jack is a super... how didn't Dash notice that Jack Jack floated into his arms during the Underminer fight? He obviously didn't reach down to pick him up? ,8r7d6q
e0rhxgp,"I thought this movie was just mediocre. I had a few laughs, mostly at Jack Jack, but other than that this movie felt bland to me. It was a pretty predictable plot, the animation looked fine (apart from a few times I thought the mouth animation looked strange), it was just... alright. I felt like there was a lot of filler in this movie, just felt like nothing happened almost this whole movie. 

It felt like they wanted to cash in on the superhero genre now that its super hot, while also cashing in on that sweet sweet nostalgia. This movie wasn't really needed, I dont feel like I got to know the characters more, the villain was pretty forgettable. 

Overall, this movie was alright. Its a cash grab but its done competently. If you liked the first movie, you'll probably get some enjoyment out of this one.  ",8r7d6q

e0po7gf,"I found it interesting that this movie strayed away from things you usually don't hear in animated films or Disney films specifically. Until recently, you never really heard the exclamation ""Oh my God"", even as ubiquitous as that phrase is even amongst non-religious people. I heard the phrase or a variation twice in the film. I also heard 2 or 3 *very mild* yet still considered ""curse"" words in the film which I had never heard in an animated Disney film (unless you count Jiminy Cricket saying jackass). I could be wrong but I am pretty sure I heard crap, damn and hell in the film. Not a huge deal but very interesting and noteworthy since the film was clearly not dumbed down for kids whatsoever. Even the dialogue was very adult and that's why Pixar shines. You see the trailers beforehand? Teen Titans? How to Train you Dragon? Grinch?? Those movies are for kids. Incredibles 2? They did not try to acquiesce here. It's a great film with witty and smart dialogue/script writing. ",8r7d6q

The first couple of minutes of the movie was good but everything after that feel so out of space and does not fit with what the first movie did. It felt way too generic and safe for me and it felt like the entire 80% of the movie after the interrogation room scene was shoehorned in. I legit thought we was going into an plot of the main characters going against the law and trying to change it themselves instead of some rich guy coming along out of nowhere to do it. It was like watching the start mediocre second season of an returning TV show. 

I didn't like the fact that they had Elastic girl do most of the hero work and Mr. Incredible doing absolutely nothing. Call me an sexist or whatever, but I legit felt the movie was trying to go the safe way and at the same time trying cater to diversity by having an female character take the main character role and having the villain as an female. Don't get me wrong tho, I actually did like the villain. She had an great laidback personality which I love because she seem like an realistic person that I can chill with at an movie theater. She was like that green female villain character from Kim Possible that I liked. But however just like that character, I felt like she was more suited as an henchman than an villain. And back to the diversity part I mentioned, I'm all for seeing women get more important roles in shows, games, and movies, but please don't always tried to follow that route just to please everybody or show that you're doing the same thing like every other company is doing. Atleqst be different and creative if you trying to cater to an certain audience. Not everybody enjoys mediocre. And I felt like that small scene between the main villain and Elastic girl where Elastic was leaning in close to the villain was kind of too fanservicy and unnecessary.

This movie played that twist out for SO LONG and it was so obvious for the entire movie. Also the ensemble of new heroes didn't feel like real characters, there was no personality. The first movie, every single character felt so real and fleshed out and I connected with all of them in one way or another. So many characters in this just felt flat.

For a Pixar movie, to me, it fell really short of what it could've been. Especially since the first Incredibles was really good. 

Again it's all subjective, but it was pretty lackluster.

1. The improvements to cloth / clothing in this film are a major, major, *major* visual enhancement over the first. It's maybe the only thing obviously aged about the first film, and so I can see why the technology was developed for Incredibles 2.

Overall, however...

Incredibles 2 was... dry, boring, rushed, and shallow compared to the first, in my opinion. My favorite part of this film was The Screenslaver action sequence. TBH, folks, I felt like I was watching a rather boring sitcom. I don't even think my daughter liked it much, and I found it confusing when people would laugh in the theater. Some jokes were funny, but many others missed the mark. There was too much yelling from Mr. Incredible and Dash for my own tastes.

I'm not sure what this film was trying to be. It was part family drama, which was too light for me to give a damn about, and not funny enough for me to enjoy how light it was. The main driving forces of the plot were cheesy and shallow. The predictability was borderline insane, and the climax and ending felt rushed.

Here, we have many moments of fighting for the sake of capturing/incapacitating but it never really felt like anyone was in mortal danger like the original. There were a several scenes where people should have died and had some sort of impact, but the film either ignores it or actively works to save them (being kicked out of a plane window) to a degree that strains my suspension of disbelief.

Screenslaver's motivation is as understandable as Syndrome's, but it's also a whole lot narrower.

e0vd889,"Overall, I would put it at ""good enough"".  Not as good as the first, but I wasn't expecting that, the first was a *very* good film.

I am just now realizing how much of a debt the series owes to The Watchmen - its larger theme, of the tensions between the extraordinarily talented supers and the less talented general population, is largely the same.  I think that is what gives it the dark overtones that others have mentioned - unlike other comic book universes, there is a very real sense that the supers do not have a guaranteed place in the world, and that the non-super population could turn on them with devastating effect.  The most obvious example of that is Syndrome's genocidal purge of supers in the first film (I think Syndrome killed more supers than have died in all the MCU films combined).

One thing that I feel compelled to mention, though I may get some hate on it: Holly Hunter sounded completely off for Elastigirl.  Her voice is just way too gravelly and lispy, if they needed someone for the voice of a government bureaucrat who lives off a diet of coffee and cigarettes she would have been perfect, but for a mother of three hitting middle age, just not a good fit.  I realize she was cast in the first movie and that that puts them in an awkward position, but it was a constant irritant.  She just sounded wrong for the role (was Ellen Barkin not available?).  Also, I think showing the short with the actors before the movie did not help, at all, it made it difficult to dissociate the actors from the characters, and when the actors are so much older than the characters, that's a major issue.",8r7d6q

e0p5m7z,"The visual storytelling and use of interesting lighting are better than anything, animated or live film, that I can remember off the top of my head. It felt as if Deakins had done the cinematography.

I know there's been some hate about the strobe light effects, but if you rewatch, just have an eye out for the ways they do chiaroscuro/backlit effects. Whoever was on lighting/cinematography was on goddamn point.

-Winston ending his story about his father (the shot in the window reflecting his face and everyone behind him)

-Holy jeepers, the fight in the dark between Elastigirl and Mr. Incredible

-The symmetrical shot of the siblings in the office (Evelynn in the dark and Win in the light)

-The scene where Elastigirl trails the Screenslaver signal across the city

-The raccoon seeing Jak Jak ignite from across the lawn chairs

Just a few I can recall, but I was floored by all these.",8r7d6q
e0p5pi5,"I enjoyed the movie but the more I think about it, the more I get depressed with the set up for this movie. In short, this is basically the first movie done in reverse. You have the underminer who was like the villain in the first movie who made explosions and he got away but caused destruction to the city and is blamed to the good guys, causing a ban for superheroes. Their lives turn to crap until they are approached by a business tycoon who wishes to provide the superhero life again for them. First one was of secrecy, the second with open arms. Notice the dynamic is the same. Guy and girl. 

Elastigirl goes instead of Bob, see them kick ass, while cutting back to the home life to see how different they are. Have some time to discuss with the true villain and rarely the tycoon, shit goes wrong, Elasti/Bob decides to investigate further, gets busted and falls for a trap while causing the significant other to spring into action while leaving the children home. 

Despite this, it was entertaining and simply incredible (hah) to watch fourteen years go by and not feel the tone has changed or been altered and is a true sequel in every sense of the word. Definitely worth a rewatch and an empty bladder cause I really had to go but didn't want to miss a single frame.

What‚Äôs didn‚Äôt work as well: where the first one had a plot that felt like the stakes were high, (the plane scene, Mr. Incredible threatening Mirage, the madness of Syndrome) this plot felt less... adult. I love kids movies, but the adultera themes is what made the first one so good, and this one was a little more childish, and had a weaker plot as a result. Also, wtf were the villains motivations? I mean i understand them but it wasn‚Äôt believable at all. 


I liked the movie a lot. And i wasn‚Äôt expecting it to hold up to the first one, but it lost a little bit of the magic because they played it so safe. ",8r7d6q

I thought the story was going to go towards the two robbers that killed the Devour parents were actually the superheroes that Mr. Deavour Sr. had on-call. So from here, I thought it was either going to be that as revenge they would try and get all supers illegal, like their actual plan in the movie; or that they would use supers to make a huge profit for their business. Anyways, I thought the movie was great!",8r7d6q
e0pa5gt,"Strictly speaking, on first viewing I didn't like it as much as the original.

But I don't think that's an inherently bad thing - Yes, I would prefer it if it were better than the original. However, The Incredibles is one of my favorite movies of all time, so for the sequel to surpass the original would have been an Incredible feat in its own right. I've been saying to myself that if ii was even close to as good as The Incredibles, it would still be an outstanding movie.

And that's basically what happened for me. No, I don't like it as much as the first one, but I still enjoyed it a lot, I still think it's a worthy sequel that didn't make me think ""I waited 14 years for *this*?"", and found the most disappointing thing about it to be the part where it ended.

I think the main thing for me is that it's very much a *different* movie, but not in a bad way. I think that's the main thing that's throwing me off, that I got something different from what I went in expecting. Again, not in any way that's inherently bad.

I fully expect to rewatch it multiple times in the future, and I'm very much open to the possibility of it growing on me now that I know what I'm watching. I wouldn't be surprised if in time, I grow to enjoy it more and like it nearly as much as the original (*which, again, is among my favorite movies of all time*). I don't expect it to ever surpass the original for me, but I'm open to it getting close.

So not as good as the original, but still not a disappointment by any means.

As a side note, between rewatching the original earlier this week and watching ii tonight, I'm now inclined to think that Edna Mode is basically the Incredibles' Universe version of what you'd get if Mr. Fantastic and Janet Van Dyne had a daughter.",8r7d6q
e0pca6r,"I laughed at several moments of this movie and I felt like more jokes were hits rather than misses but the plot left a lot more to be desired, even for a kids movie. Honestly, the third act felt dragged out and I thought Jack-Jack's comedy was more intrusive than anything else. 

In the first movie I felt like it did a much better job of balancing the family dynamic and super heroics but in this one the direction seemed stretched out. 

The villains plan also didn't make any sense at any point and it felt like too much of a retrend with Syndrome. The movie in general felt like it had too many ""hey remember when we did that in the first movie?"" callbacks. 

It's a cute movie but not much more.",8r7d6q

e0t2puw,"Not a big fan of the movie.  It is serviceable, but it does not come anywhere near the heights of the first movie.  My main problem is that the plot is a complete rehash of the first movie.  We all waited years to see these characters develop, but at the end of the movie they are all pretty much the same.  What was the point in making a sequel that is the same as the first one with the only difference being that Elastigirl is the main character?",8r7d6q
e0v56z8,"It was on par with *Finding Dory* -- a solid if underwhelming sequel that neither tarnishes the original nor makes me want to see a third installment. Brad Bird is still a master of action, comedy and comedy-through-action, which made it a fun entertainment, but the movie felt like it was cobbled together from spare parts and multiple drafts. It's like they couldn't decide what direction to take the sequel, so they tried a little bit of everything. 

Bob, Helen and Violet all had storylines that could have cut deeply, but instead they were mostly played for laughs. Maybe Violet could have made a serious decision not to become a superhero -- just like kids in real life decide not to take over the family business or go to med/law school. But instead she throws a tantrum at breakfast and that's the end of it. Maybe a younger, ""cooler"" superhero like Voyd makes Helen feel old and insecure. But instead, it's just a setup for some fangirl jokes. Speaking of the new supers, they were basically just cannon fodder for the third-act action scenes. It would have been nice to see some new characters developed properly if they weren't going to delve more deeply into the main cast.

Also, a lot of the movie felt cliched and uninspired. Another ""surprise twist"" villain? Another runaway train rescue? Neuralyzer from Men In Black? Mind-control devices to make good guys do bad things? During the move-in scene, I immediately thought of ""You Only Move Twice."" Maybe it's because Bird worked on The Simpsons, but I see a super-peppy mogul moving a family of 5 into a fancy new house and I think of Hank Scorpio. Finally, Jack-Jack got a lot of laughs, but making him a deus ex machina with unlimited powers went too far. In retrospect, I think it was a mistake not to age up the characters 5-10 years.",8r7d6q

e12o2nt,"Evelyn and Mirage Theory- 

Evelyn's plan was ready WAY too soon after the events of the first movie. No way she could have done any of it without the presence of a Super.

So she created one. But he failed.

After Buddy was rejected my Mr Incredible he went home angry. Decides to destroy the Supers.

He sees a Millionaire endorsing Supers, namely ones that end up dead at this hide out, and hires two thugs to go kill the millionaire thinking it will weaken the Supers if they can't protect their number one supporter.

The Evelyn and her brother take this loss very differently.

Somehow, somehow, Buddy and Evelyn meet. Maybe by his design,  trying to get close to the daughter of the man that had more information than anyone on the Supers. Maybe by accident.  

Years go by and Buddy is working with Evelyn on weapons and becoming wealthy so he could execute the plan from the first movie.

Meanwhile, Evelyn has her own plans. She hates Supers and doesn't want ANYONE to be one...not even Buddy. She prepares her counter attack. Her brother wants to bring them back, Buddy wants to be one, she wants to lure them ALL out and destroy them.

She enlist the assistance of her friend? Fellow classmate? Mirage, whom has infiltrated her way into the government and double agent and has been tasked with helping buddy kill all the supers because it still costs the government so much money to hide them.

Evelyn and Mirage planned on Buddy killing all the supers, becoming the new face of the Supers, taking Elastigirl's spot in the second movie's series of events so that she could draw out all the supers at once and use them to destroy any credibility they had to that point.

Jordan Peterson said to really punish someone, wait until they do something good and are happy then punish them...maximizes the misery...

Buddy would have been on top of the world,  defeated the incredibles,  then used as a pawn in Evelyn's game to end them forever. 

But...Mirage screwed up, helped the Incredibles...maybe even reported to Evelyn that they were a better fit for her plan. Let them escape and defeat Buddy.

‚Ä¢ lots of funny moments 
‚Ä¢ more fast paced than the original 
‚Ä¢ great action with intense fights 
‚Ä¢ really good and realistic dialogue 

Dislikes/nitpicks

‚Ä¢ this movie beat the crap out of Bob Parr to the point where it made me feel bad for him.
‚Ä¢ Underminer‚Äôs motivations turned into the generic ‚Äòrobbing the bank‚Äô scheme. And he got away with barely any mentions after! 
‚Ä¢ ugh, Violet was so annoying. Understandable, but still. 
‚Ä¢ Jack Jack was funny but some of his jokes went on to long. 
‚Ä¢ that girl being the villain was way to obvious and she lacks the charisma and psycho of Syndrome. Syndrome>>> this lady 
‚Ä¢ perhaps it was the point, but Elassthicc girl looked younger in this movie while Bob looked way older. 
‚Ä¢ the animation is more detailed but is a bit to glossy and saturated imo.

What it didn‚Äôt manage to capture, however, is the more important things that made the original one of today‚Äôs animation classic. Its only ‚Äúsin‚Äù is not being able to surpass or even match the first film‚Äôs near-mystical status. Nonetheless, we can try to get that out of the equation and allow this film to shine all by itself.

In summary, the film somehow has weaker characterizations than the previous one. The plot also was unsurprising at some point and overall feels too conventional. This could be some serious implications, but it‚Äôs a kids‚Äô movie, so who cares? Really, despite these shortcomings, *Incredibles 2* delivers a satisfying payoff from the 14 long years of waiting. But if we are to wait another decade again for a possible threequel, then we will be having a different conversation.

e0yg81g,"It's not quite as good as the original, but I mostly liked this.  I had just rewatched the original, so it was fresh in my mind, and I'm not sure if I would have liked it more or less had I not just done so.

What I liked: First, it was just nice to spend some more time with these characters.  I thought Bob Odenkirk, Catherine Keener, and Jonathan Banks were great additions to the cast. The action set pieces were pretty good, especially the train stoppage and the assault on the Parr's house. I mostly liked the new supers (there is a but on this, see below). Jack-Jack fighting the raccoon and Edna's scenes were two major highlights.  I seriously could have watched another 20 minutes of Jack-Jack vs. raccoons.

What I didn't like: I thought the new supers were slightly underused, especially in the last action scene.  I just wish that super vs. super fight would have gone on longer. I thought the Screenslaver twist was super obvious, though I'm not totally sure if it was supposed to be a mystery. I kind of wish it had gotten into the main plot faster, and the Screenslaver had a longer role before the ""capture"". I also thought the animation was weirdly shoddy in some places, which isn't something I'd ever expect from Pixar.  This may have just been the screen I was watching on, but I especially thought the animation of Winston was terrible.

Nitpick corner:I liked Jonathan Banks performance, but I felt like he was playing a completely different character from the one that was in the first movie.  This is something I don't think I'd have noticed or cared about if I hadn't just watched the first one, though.

Overall I liked this a lot and had a ton of fun.  It didn't quite live up to my expectations as a big fan of the original (probably my favorite Pixar movie, but at worst top 3) but it was a very enjoyable two hours.  I give it a 4/5.",8r7d6q
e0uho48,"I like how they made a big deal about how long of a wait it's been before the movie started and how Samuel Jackson said it was worth it, which already worried me a bit.  Then you see the movie and you think ""well... now I'm even more confused because they could've made this in one year.""

I'm probably just too spoiled by anime recently.

The first Incredibles was just SO amazing though with great character development and morals that seemed to have gotten lost here.  To be fair, they REALLY didn't have any business going in-depth on the undertaker battle, that was an obvious non-interesting setup from the first movie to get you excited that they were back in action again, but nobody gave a shit about actually seeing what was going to happen directly afterwards, which is WHY it was such an amazing ending.

Anyway, not really worth watching.  Seems like it was made by people who didn't understand the first movie at all... even though it theoretically couldn't have been.  Really weird.",8r7d6q
e0pcafn,"That was perfection.  I decided to watch my previous favorite pixar film, wall-e, after seeing this and I have to say, I think not only do I prefer incredibles 2 to the original, but I also prefer it to my all time favorite pixar movie.  Since we already know the family dynamic and the majority of the families super powers (minus jack jack) we can get right into the action and plot nearly immediately.  Idk if I cared much for the very beginning of the film with the interrogation between the kid that likes Violet and him kinda half recapping everything but whatever everything afterwards was great.

I have to say, the storyline of this and the commentary it had on the relationship between heroes, politics, and police was great.  It kept me engaged throughout.  It also wasn't afraid to discuss death, nor was it afraid to threaten other characters lives.  The movie is something kids can enjoy but it also felt like something that considered how people who are now adults are also interested in watching a sequel to one of their childhood favorites.  There was a lot of great lighting throughout the movie, however I am surprised there was no seizure warning before the film.  One of the characters powers involves flashing lights, and in a dark theater where this happens in multiple scenes it can kinda hurt ones eyes.  It wasn't Porygon Pokemon episode bad, but I can see maybe it could be a problem.  Outside of that though the movie was really fun, lots of great action, this movie just reminds me that super hero action scenes are always better as animation.  So much more fun stuff that can happen in the medium of animation.  They of course had the 113 reference which was pretty easy to point out during this movie.  I loved the Edna scenes and also all the elastigirl moments.  It didn't feel forced at all to have her as the forefront because the movie still gave more than enough time to flesh out Mr. Incredible and the other kids as well.  Admittedly, compared to the other characters Dash didn't really have as much of a difficult arc, however he and all the characters were still entertaining to watch. It was pretty obvious to me from the get go who the villain was, but I did like how the movie developed them and their motives throughout the film.  It definitely got all the things right about what makes a good super hero movie, which is focusing on a battle of morals rather than a battle of the fists.

Overall I give Incredibles 2 a strong 9 out of 10.  Better than the original.  A lot to unpack in terms of the social commentary on heroes.  I am ok with this movie winning oscars for next year over Isle of Dogs tbh.

Oh would like to add about the short in the beginning, it was alright.  I have to say the moment the mom ate the bao kinda caught me off guard.  However, it wasn't that emotional for me because i have seen so many short film animations kinda like this that go through a child like character aging and moving on.  Sad piano did help make it more emotional, but didn't get me to cry.  Also would like to add that I was pleased with my theater experience.  I was so worried I'd have crying and obnoxious children, however all the kids in the theater were more respectful than numerous marvel and star wars showings I've been to.  First movie in a long while I've been to where everyone clapped at the end.",8r7d6q
e0pi5e7,"For 14 years of waiting this film felt rushed. For me it is still a solid 8/10 but just the recycling of the plot from the 1st one really gets me down about this movie.

The animation was freaking amazing, that train chase scene is what this movie should be winning an Emmy for, holy shit.

I would have loved to see proper 1 on 1 fights on the ship was well. Like seeing Violet and Void face off was so good, so I wish Dash & Jack Jack got there own 1 on 1s, maybe Dash with the lightning guy and Jack Jack with Reflux.

I've come to expect more emotional storytelling from Pixar, and this story felt....slight? in comparison to some of their other work.

Couldn't void simply make the ship go into a different direction? They couldn't make brick go break the rotors? Or the pipes blocking the engine room?

Some people have mentioned the fact that Elastigirl's story in this movie reflects Mr. Incredible's story from the first one. I thought it was funny that in a way, Mr. Incredible had the same thing happen to him twice, he joins someone who promises him a return to his superhero days who turns out to be the bad guy. 

The appearance of the supers while under control of the Screenslaver was pretty unnerving. One minor tick I found was that it seemed implied that while under the control of the Screenslaver, the people could only act after being given a command or general order (like patrol the ship, or bring me the children), but specifically when Void was talking to Evelyn on the phone, Void seemed like she wasn't being held to that rule. Also, I felt like it was supposed to be heavily implied that Winston was made to be the on-camera Screenslaver, since in the scene where Elastigirl was trying to track him, it really sounded his like voice. However, it was never actually mentioned. Evelyn did say it was prerecorded.",8r7d6q

This is the opposite of SUperhero fatigue, this is what the popularization of superhero films is suppose to deliver. Incredible movies supposedly in the same 'genre' delivering different, but awesome and unique films with great stories.

e0pc0m0,"I‚Äôll say this, I think it was a very good movie. The third act is where I have problems. The villain twist was too predictable and her motivations felt off. Like, the government made the heroes go into hiding, so that‚Äôs why they couldn‚Äôt answer the phones anymore (which also why their dad was a thundering dumbass), but like why blame it on the superheroes. The one line I liked form her was that superheroes make ordinary people weak mentally because they‚Äôll have all of their problems solved for them. Like that‚Äôs cool. That should‚Äôve been expanded on more. Anyway, I also wish the third act was more satisfying than punch all the glasses off everyone and steer the ship away. Like the first one set up ideas in the first acts that would be later used in the third like the capes and the football throwing and the expectations of Violet‚Äôs force field abilities. And then Jack jack‚Äôs surprise powers obviously was the highlight. And then became the highlight of Incredibles 2 as well. Like I gotta say, I LOVED the second act of this movie. Elastagirl‚Äôs action set pieces were off the chain. I wish the end where everyone was together would‚Äôve been more creative. I really feel like Dash got short handed in this movie which is too bad. I feel like I‚Äôm kinda rambling but in the end I still think this is in the higher tier of Pixar movies and better movies of 2018. ",8r7d6q
e0ppk7h,"I was pleasantly surprised at this movie. Too much nostalgia for the first film for me to ever call this ""as good,"" but I thought it was still a lot of fun. I had very low expectations because the last Pixar sequel I saw was Finding Dory, and the last Brad Bird film I saw was Tomorrowland. One thing a lot of sequels do that I don't like is relying to heavily on callbacks, and I think this film largely avoided that. ",8r7d6q

e0pifu3,"Great movie; my top 3 films of the year so far! Liked the new characters and their casting was great.

Thought there was a great potential at playing up Elastigirl saving a train when Mr Incredible trying to save a train 20 years prior was what was the last straw. Should have played that up more. 

Loved that they added stuff to the world like other famous suit designers and that Jack Jack having multiple powers is common for babies; could see them doing a sequel, or hopefully a spin off, considering the lore of other heroes from the first movies DVD bonus features. 

My only minor nitpick is that the villian's name, Screenslaver, is a pun on Screensaver, a concept that didn't fit in the time period of the 70s.

It was fantastic, loved it.",8r7d6q

Could it have been that he traveled to another dimension, and brought Dash and Violet with him? If that's so, that means the kids disapear from one dimension and only saved their parents in another dimension not their own and all super heros are left brainwashed in their home dimension.

But let‚Äôs think back 14 years. What happened right before the underminer? Syndrome maybe and the omnidroid fight???

Did everyone in the city forget incredibles+frozone saved the whole city from a giant robot? Like wtf? Someone in this thread had a great idea: flip the movies plots so this is sequence:

Incredibles 1: buddy jacks up mr incredibles mission and gets Mr incredible sued. The supers go underground cause of bomb voyage fallout. THEN frozone is approached by the tycoon guy and the events of incredibles 2 plays out. Movie ends with super being welcomed by the public again.

Incredibles 2: 14 years later after the long wait...incredibles are thought to be heroes until some start disappearing. Meanwhile Syndrome has seen the popularity of supers due to screenslaver defeat and fuels his motivation of being rejected by his hero to make him even a greater villain to foil supers reputation, and profit from it. Then jack jack murders him in a jet the end.

Anyway guys:  boss baby, I mean incredibles 2 would have been better if the plots were flipped. Guarantee it we would love them more. Plus the reveal of Buddy becoming Syndrome after a 14 year setup would have been dare I say....incredible??",8r7d6q

e0szgha,"I really hated this film. I don't understand how it can be getting such good reviews. This film is just built on some of the worst tropes out there. We have the mom going back to work and Bob left to play the role of bad mad soccer dad. Like how many times have we seen this exact same thing done. 

Also it played out exactly how I expected from the trailer. We got a short scene of the Incredibles working together. The the whole second act is just Elastagirl in action and Mr. Incredible being bad mad soccer dad. Then we finally get the team back in action at the end.

This is really dumb. This would be like if the Fantastic Four were formed in their origin movie, then right in the next movie they are broken up again. It felt like they were just retreading the same shit.

I feel like the first film set up a great sequel that actually focused on the family working together and figuring out how to be the best team that they can be. This movie should have just been called Elastagirl and Jack Jack. 

And I honestly didn't feel like Mr. Incredible's dad time really developed his character much. Overall just having such a focus on Elastagirl was just so disappointing. You really only see one power set, and yeah some of the scene were well done with the action. But I feel like it's such a missed opportunity. 

It also used the really dumb trope of mind-control. I'm sorry but mind-control just always feels like such a forced plot point. It is just so you can have characters act out of character for no real reason. ""Oh lets have a fight between Mr. Incredible and Elstagirl. But how do we do that? I know mind control"". I dunno mind control is just one of those tropes that INSTANTLY turns me off from the plot. I'm just sitting their waiting for the mind control to end and actual real character development to happen. 

This film to me was honestly one of Pixar's worst films. The humor wasn't really strong, it had some good action but it was all wasted because it was just focused on Elstagirl. And the family scenes with Mr. Incredible were really trite, really baseline sitcom bullshit, like stuff you'd see on full house kind of garbage. I mean Violet, Dash, and Mr. Incredible are pretty much completely sidelined for a majority of the movie. How the fuck do you write an Incredibles sequel and *only* focus on one character? I get that some people see the first film as doing this with Mr. Incredible. But the kids and Elstagirl had a lot of great memorable scenes in there. They came into their own in the second act pretty strongly. Also the villain was such a dumb boring twist that you pretty much saw from the very beginning. 

I'm really surprised how much people are flocking to this. It feels like its purely fueled by nostalgia. I think one day eventually people will see this as the completely wasted opportunity that it is. This movie should have just been titled Elstagirl because the actual Incredibles are barely fucking in it. Fuck this film. Brad Bird has become a hack. And fuck all the zombies who think this is a good sequel to a great film. ",8r7d6q

e24ynmt,"I had a TON of problems with this movie. 
The misogyny was real here folks. 
The characters were all angry with each other, constantly. It wasn't funny how Mr. Incredible could not be happy and cheer on his wife's successes. To beat a dead horse, he's completely incapable of taking care of his children too. He DGAF about Jack-Jack until he showed signs of having powers, and even then his parenting is atrocious. 
Poor Violet. In the last film, we saw that she was finally feeling confident and coming out of her shell. As soon as this film took off, they took that away from her and left her feeling unimportant, ignored by her family, and alone to deal with problems with not an ounce of support. That invisible ice cream scene? You were intentionally showing how you assume women deal with their problems. Cool. OR MAYBE you could have been the example we needed to show families to be close and share their feelings. I felt for all the families watching this. To see marital problems on the big screen when you go to the movies to get away from it all. Fighting, politics, gun violence?? Yeah this movie sucked. There was almost zero representation outside of a white family who happened to move into a huge house for no reason. Remember in the first film they lived in a small and modest household? Oh and my absolute favorite part was during the first scene when the Family stopped the big drill from destroying the city - the cops came and FROZONE RAN FROM THE COPS. TF? 

Pixar, you have a huge platform. You could have shown your audience  that the stars of the film are compassionate, loving, understanding, team players. It was very sad to see that the characters did not develop into being role models. I feel sorry for their family and the lack of love.

- ‚Äúhes rich so nothing will happen, just a slap on the wrist.‚Äù Really unnecessary in a kids movie and the ‚Äúevil rich people‚Äù rhetoric felt forced.

- father is a total idiot in the household and Mrs. Incredible is taken for granted because she does a great job at it, unlike Mr. Incredible. This topic isn't SJW in it of itself, but the way they went about it makes it obvious it has a feminist agenda.

- the banter between villain and Mrs. Incredible about how women rock is and men are dumb is just too obvious at how it‚Äôs feminism in going a little overboard.

Overall a good movie but the SJW stuff took away from the movie. My gf liked it but even she said all that crap felt forced at times. Curious to see how many downvotes the truth will get.",8r7d6q

e0p2oce,So sad despite the dumpling kid turning into a jerk by his teens,8r7d6q
e0p5ipt,"I'm still sorta confused by that... Like, I understand the sentiment of it but was the dumpling baby just a depiction of her actual son? Why a dumpling?",8r7d6q

Meanwhile I was over here tearing up wanting to call my mom. ",8r7d6q

It was great",8r7d6q

e0p6y1i,Every damn time too. ,8r7d6q
e0p7wbi,"Wait did Violet know about the googles at that point? As far as she knew, it might have just been part of some villainous fashion design. ",8r7d6q
e0r9jij,"Was it because Void had fallen a level down, and Violet wouldn't be able to come down and up again? Either way, it's never explained.",8r7d6q
e0x1ot0,"Was she actually shown to be unconscious or just knocked around? I could easily be overreaching, but they might have purposely tried to avoid the convenient knock-out trope that was in most super hero movies/shows, since we now know how dangerous it is. And I think Voyd is up and about next time we see the hyno'd heros, so Violet may have taken the chance to run off unabated(and I don't think I saw any telltale residue left on her).",8r7d6q
e0rfili,She probably didn‚Äôt realize the glasses hypnotized until Jack Jack pulled them off Elastigirl.,8r7d6q

cool detail tho",8r7d6q
e17bw4f,"It's like poetry, it rhymes.",8r7d6q
e0pba5w,Yeah that was terrifying. First the quiet and creepy room. Then the sudden and disorienting light. Helen can't even look or she gets hypnotized. And then the taser slowly incapacitating her.,8r7d6q
e0pls3k,Hands down the most intense Pixar sequence ever. Really edge-of-seat shit right there. People in my showing let out shrieks and gasps during that sequence. And the chase afterwards reminded me a lot of the chase scene in Seven. ,8r7d6q
e0pckra,"Yeah! That whole sequence is really suspenseful, right from Screenslaver standing by the door. Once the fight starts, it's scary to think that Helen is completely alone - no supers, no back up or anything. ",8r7d6q
e0sd7il,It makes me wonder how much worse it would have been for her if he was actually trying.,8r7d6q
e0tvx0n,I had watched Hereditary earlier and so watching that scene made me feel very strangely tense! *Especially* when she reaches under the door and the ‚ÄúScreenslaver‚Äù is *right there*!,8r7d6q
e12gcrg,"The fight in the cage was insane as heck. Having to see Elastigirl struggle was nerve-wracking, and slowly seeing him losing his footing from backing out of the cage, to out of the apartment and to out of the building was insanely well done.",8r7d6q
e0vf84j,"I swear that entire scene was an intentional nod to the movie *Se7en* and if that's true, holy shit kids movie, that's insane but awesome.",8r7d6q
e0tdfix,I was a little surprised that the Faraday cage wasn't a plot point.,8r7d6q
e172g9g,There was also the unnerving visual of the screenslaver in the darkness when she was reaching her hand under the door to unlock it.,8r7d6q
e0umy7i,"Her walking around his apartment reminded me of Zodiac 

Not what I was expecting in this movie lol ",8r7d6q
e21ojd7,Did anyone else get freaked out when elastagirl was unlocking the locks and that mask was just there ? ,8r7d6q
e19270x,Reminded me of when Clarisse is in the dark in Silence of the Lambs ,8r7d6q
e1a301d,"There was a 3-year-old behind me who started crying during that scene. Crying to other mama that it was too spooky. Even later when they jut held up the Screenslaver‚Äôs mask, she would gasp and cover her eyes.",8r7d6q

e0pbopc,"Chad (the news anchor) especially, when he looks up right at Elastigirl.... super creepy.",8r7d6q

e0prkvz,[deleted],8r7d6q

e0rysv5,Worked for him. It wasn't anything he could solve with physical strength.,8r7d6q
e0ucsoo,"that's a good point I didn't think about. I was initially disappointed they would go the simple jealousy route, because they're freakin adults, but yeah they did change it. ",8r7d6q
e1r2sen,"I haven't seen the first film in a while, but what happened when Violet and Dash were babies? Like, this movie just made me wonder how they handled things back when the older kids were growing up. Was Helen the stay at home mom and Bob out at his insurance job? Were they still secretly doing super stuff while alternating raising two young kids? Because the way Bob acted in this movie made it seem like he never did any parenting at all. Maybe if he said something like ""I'm not 35 anymore"" when he was staying up all night helping Dash and trying to put Jack Jack to sleep it wouldn't make him seem like such a resentful father. Basically, I agree that Bob moving past being jealous and actually putting effort into being a good dad was a welcome change. ",8r7d6q
e0q72zc,We'll get him. Eventually.,8r7d6q
e0umg2n,"If I recall correctly, there was a video game that was meant to be the sequel for the Incredibles film called The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer, and the main plot of the story was taking down the Underminer. So they probably didn't want to retread that ground ",8r7d6q
e0s5jd8,What if it's a running joke for all the incredibles movies that they never catch him lol,8r7d6q
e0rlufx,Well yeah-  SKIPPY here made sure of that,8r7d6q
e0s333e,"I guess in this universe, Batman's cape got stuck under his feet which made him slipped and died. RIP.",8r7d6q
e0w543u,I got an Iron Man vibe because the house looked like the house in Iron Man 3.,8r7d6q
e0viwxc,I thought it was going to turn out to be one of Syndromes places.,8r7d6q
e0wqimh,I thought the billionaire would end up being Screenslaver,8r7d6q
e10g8t7,I mean not really lol. The Wayne Mansion is always a classic Gothic-revival style architecture. The idea of an eccentric rich billionaire isn't Batman-specific. ,8r7d6q
e2l9cs3,I was thinking more Hank Scorpio,8r7d6q
e0p2pky,Easily the best part of the movie aside from Edna's babysitting,8r7d6q
e0p2s8e,Brad Bird basically paused his own movie to do a completely nuts Looney Tunes short. My man!,8r7d6q
e0p1qsg,"Calling it now I3 will have a villain group of Bomb voyage, Raccoon, Pizza delivery guy, and underminer

And it will be 100X better than injustice league",8r7d6q
e0p49uq,"Best fight of the movie.

Better than fighting Thanos even. I‚Äôm prepared for downvotes. ",8r7d6q
e0pm3wl,Raccoon? More like a sweet rabbit or trash panda.,8r7d6q
e0sy6ho,Jack Jack had a longer fight scene than Dash,8r7d6q
e0sb7bk,"I love he has an arch nemesis so early in life, how sweet!",8r7d6q
e0ve65q,"Was I the only one who expected that to become a recurring gag?  I guess they needed time for the rest of the movie, but I'd have loved it if there was basically a constant ongoing Tom and Jerry cartoon in the background with them.",8r7d6q
e0p14hd,"A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.",8r7d6q
e1q1r1w,I think Jack Jack is the best baby in animations that I can remember ,8r7d6q
e0pbrnd,"Counterpoint: the raccoon sequence did NOT work for me.  

In the Incredibles' universe, (it would have seemed to me anyway), animals do not display human-ish qualities and would not have engaged in a battle with a baby. At least, not in the cutesy, overly aware, frustrated way that it did. 

This racoon seemed way too much like the squirrel in ""Ice Age"" for my tastes.",8r7d6q
e1hmlyn,easily my favorite part of the entire film,8r7d6q
e0p4ls3,"I love the aesthetic of the first one and this one follows that, but is even more colorful. The lighting at sunset by the motel, and then when they were talking by the pool at night, and then at the buffet... it's a gorgeous movie. ",8r7d6q

When she splits the bike in two and uses that to jump over traffic, ***damn***.",8r7d6q

e0swnns,The super fast sequences were me favorite :),8r7d6q
e0wr3tx,"I like the setting of the original movie better, but this is definitely the more colorful movie.",8r7d6q
e0ujsvo,"That train chase thing gave me an area for a great Disney ride in the vein of the Spider-Man ride at Universal. The cars are like sidecars for the Elasticycle, and when she stretches and the bike splits in two, the sidecar detached and drops only to be pulled back.",8r7d6q
e0p3lqw,That and when he got huge,8r7d6q
e0p92fv,"All scenes of Jack Jack and Edna were golden. While they were walking in that hallway, I swear Jack Jack and Edna were exhibiting so much sass.",8r7d6q
e0p339m,Probably the second biggest laugh for me from the movie . I melted into a kid watching the movie . ,8r7d6q
e0spmyf,Not enough Edna in my opinion. Wish she had more scenes.,8r7d6q
e0qihv4,Shit had me rolling ,8r7d6q
e0pvjqa,"What was up with that group of supers? They all looked like there was something wrong with them.

e0pdtob,"The bit with the suit in the disposer had me in stitches. Edna doesn't make fragile suits, dahling. ",8r7d6q
e0qynzg,Violet‚Äôs arc was my favorite for this reason. It just felt so real and relatable. I liked Dash‚Äôs ‚Äúis she hitting adolescents‚Äù line because I totally expected a ‚ÄúIs she on her period‚Äù joke and I wasn‚Äôt expecting Dash‚Äôs comment but it makes sense because he‚Äôs a boy who doesn‚Äôt understand what that is yet. ,8r7d6q
e0t39js,"they nailed the ""eating a tub of ice cream to get over a guy"" bit",8r7d6q
e0tsqga,Sarah Vowell is great. She‚Äôs written several history books that she narrates and after years of listening to her sarcastically talk about the revolutionary war and dead presidents it was fun to have her playing a teenage superhero again.,8r7d6q

e0pa65h,"I think you hit the nail on the head with the lesson. Evelyn was supposed to be in the wrong. She was possessed by her grief over her father's death and jealous over her brother's public success. For her, superheroes were a scapegoat for everything she was feeling.

I think she has a newfound appreciation for heroes, however, when Elastigirl saves her from her fall. She's still arrested, but there's a hint of growth in her demeanor.",8r7d6q
e0t2ks5,"I also like how she was essentially correct about her father's death: if he had gone to the safe-room, he'd have been fine.  But that twisted her into a hatred of his belief in and eventual over-reliance on the goodness of others.",8r7d6q
e0sqq57,"Honestly, Eveline's philosophy reminded me of the villain Shigaraki from *My Hero Academia*. Heroes make others weak by depending on them too much, so society as a whole would be better without supers.",8r7d6q

e1dd1kj,"One bit I really appreciated was at one point during the fight on the ship, Bob comes up against Brick and it turns out Brick is stronger than him and pinned him to a wall, which brings up the question of how can Bob be better than or equal to Brick? And then Elastigirl comes up from behind and restrains Brick, giving Bob the opening to punch the goggles off Brick's face. And there's your answer: Bob is a family man, and that's one of his strengths, not a drawback. I thought that was a very thoughtful little sequence.",8r7d6q

I don‚Äôt recall them doing this in Cars 3, but it does make me wonder if they‚Äôll do something similar in Toy Story 4. Seeing a scene from the original Toy Story go through a 24-year time warp would be insane.",8r7d6q

The threat facing the kids was so overwhelming ( fighting your own parents and an army of supers *and* a villain you haven't even met before who already defeated everyone else) the only reason they actually made it through was because of Jack-Jack's chaotic power set.   Jack-Jack is so much like the Hulk in The Avengers, he's a hand grenade you roll into a room when all other options have been exhausted.",8r7d6q

I will say that I thought the villain‚Äôs motives felt weak compared to Syndrome‚Äôs. I enjoyed that Syndrome wanted to make everyone super while she wanted to make sure that no one was super.

e0ukqfx,"It‚Äôs because the characters who end up being the villain don‚Äôt fit a understood role in the film until the twist. Like Frozen does this perfectly, where we think Hans is just the corny love interest and he turns out to be full on evil. We think we understand him as a character, so we let our guard down on him. 

Hell Coco did this super well with the reveal of Miguel‚Äôs ancestor. We all thought he was the comic relief character, making his significance a surprise. 

The second Evelin came on screen she just screamed villain. She wasn‚Äôt funny enough to be a comic relief character (like her brother sort of did) so it was crystal clear from the start. ",8r7d6q

e0vh7gz,"I find surprise villains pretty lazy, in the end run. It's a cheap way to get some shock, but by now a lot of audiences expect a twist, so it's not really all that effective. I know the genre isn't for adults, but we really need to break the pattern at this point. Otherwise a lot of these movies will suffer when it comes to the test of time. Example: The Incredibles spent its entire runtime building up Syndrome as a villain you can understand- and The Incredibles 2 spent a lot of its runtime trying to figure out how to define even the basics of its villain. Had they made it more straightforward (like they did with Incredibles) it would've been more effective and bold. The Incredibles 2 threatened to become far too complicated for its genre and audience. 

The 'surprise villain' twist seems more like a marketing decision than a genuine storytelling decision these days, given Disney deals almost exclusively in it now.

e0p765d,"I also felt they were pulling their punches a bit with the villain.   Middle school me was impressed that Syndrome was a legitimate threat and actually managed to kill people (and met a proper supervillain demise in return).  The first one was one of the few animated movies to actually EARN it's PG rating.   This was not the case this time around, despite a great design for the  character,  I can't help but wonder if Disney was afraid of angering the moral guardians.

More remarkably, though, the entire movie was a mirrored version of the original. In this movie, elastigirl goes to ""work"" with a corporation that has a taste for very modern architecture with huge empty spaces and trippy technological furniture, where her work is reliving her past as a superhero, while Bob stays at home with the kids. The villain she has to defeat happens to be a creation of the corporation itself, and she gets betrayed (I believe the reason why the twist felt predictable to so many people is because it was really the same twist as in the first film, and the situation surrounding it was so similar).

This!!! You can control minds and your only plan is to ram a boat into the city? They could have done so much more. 

I kept expecting the mind slaver to put the incredibles in a moral grey area like the first one when mr incredible had the option to crush the villain. It was missing that one really dark and haunting scene. ",8r7d6q
e0r2o8h,"Yeah I have to be honest, it really lacked the thematic richness, character, and emotion of the original. It did not ruin anything, so that's a plus, however you can't help but feel like their goal was to open the series up for larger 'cinematic universe' possibilities.

For instance, the original did a lot of satirizing of superhero tropes (Syndrome's joke about Monologuing, Edna on the danger of capes), where this one ended up playing those tropes straight and kinda ignored some of its own ridiculousness. I was hoping, given that the Marvel Universe has sprung up since the original, that they would poke fun at the genre more.

And it didn't raise the stakes like the first film did. Whereas Syndrome was literally *killing* superheroes to design his weapon, fired missiles on an unarmed aircraft, and his henchmen were armed with very real guns, everything about the plot in this one felt very 'nonlethal,' and so there seemed no genuine threat to the heroes.

And finally, it seemed to have less to 'say' and truncated much of the character growth that the original achieved. In the first one we have Violet's insecurity, body image issues and how this effected her ability to use her powers, and Dash's frustration with being forced to limit himself and not achieve his full potential. Both have conflicts and grow through the film. In this one Violet's 'conflict' was being emotional over a boy, and Dash had no real conflict to speak of.

So while I feel you could spend hours dissecting the message, themes, etc. from Incredibles 1 (in addition to being a great action flick) this one was just a great action flick with less going on under the surface.

Jak-Jak, however, was hilarious and essentially worth the price of admission by himself.

Brad Bird said he isn't that interested in the superhero mythology and just wants to focus on the family... which is fine, but why keep them separated for most of the movie again...? Villain was lame and a huge step down from Syndrome. Some great action and comedy though. And there's setup for a really interesting Incredibles 3.

Violet also can float in her shields since the first movie. But it probably takes more effort and has to be intentional. Since she didn't see it coming, she got wrecked.

e1chktt,"If they kept up with the whole Black Mirror thing, I could see the motivation being interesting. Instead, it was kind of brushed off, despite that awesome speech she gave while Elastigirl searched for the signal.

Also, her philosophy of selfishness above everything else and looking down on Elastigirl's idealism is kind of important: It addresses the Radian objectivist philosophy many people saw in the first film.

Ok yes story-wise, it was predictable. It was predictable as fuck and you know she's behind it within 30 seconds of meeting her. Sure. But I think she's better than people say. She was a much better Lex Luthor than Jessie Eisenberg, for example.",8r7d6q

Contrast that with the final battle where his job is to push a button to bring the anchor with Bob back up out of the water.  But, he can't do it until Bob has done what he needs to do.

The whole concept on whether or not heroes are dangerous or not was already introduced in the original movie so I'm not saying Civil War introduced it either. What I am saying is that that movie also focused on that and even had a villain who was a villain cause their family died as a result of superheroes' actions.

I've had similar issues with the side characters in Monsters U and Finding Dory (and obviously Cars 2 and 3...). For whatever reason, every Pixar sequel outside of the Toy Stories has lame side characters. Hell, even Toy Story 3 had some forgettable characters with Bonnie's toys (besides Chuckles, R.I.P.

They weren't just throwaway characters that get introduced in one scene, quickly defeated, and then never seen again.

Void was my favorite, but the other ones had cool shit to do too. The gravity crushing guy was awesome, and the electric dude had some pretty clever moves. Owl guy was the only weak one for me.

After they all get freed and Violet tells her to not yell at them, she says she's proud.

e2ui99x,"I noticed that part too. That was obviously the 'Author's Note' i.e. the trope from films, books etc. where just in case you missed it the director / writer has a character monologue about what the theme of the film is. Brad Bird is well known for having an Ayn Rand style Objectiveist philosophy and in each of his films you see these themes repeat. The general form of the theme is '*there are special people in the world and they should be allowed to be special by pathetic normal people regardless of the effect of this on the rest of society, as allowing them to be special will - in a sort of social version of the free-market - be for the betterment of everyone and anyone who opposes this is to be hated and feared'.* This is why his films often have governments / laws / ""normal people"" as the enemies; typical Randian stuff.

It is particularly prevalent in 'Tomorrowland' where the film opens with scenes about the tragedy of stupid normal people shutting down the Space-Shuttle programme which the hero of the story is trying to stop (even though in reality the Space-Shuttle programme was shut down because it never made any sense in the first place and was a money pit). Hugh Laurie's character has a monologue near the end of that terrible film that is very similar to The Screenslaver's monologue you referred to and also to Syndrome's monologue in the original Incredibles (Syndrome's statement that 'when everyone's super, no one will be' is basically the pointed anathema to Randian philosophy and is why he is the villain). Even in 'The Iron Giant' the evil Government is the villain.

Brad Bird knows how toxic aligning yourself with Ayn Rand is with a lot of people these days and so typically denies the comparison. But if you have read Rand, the influence is obvious. In some of his films, he simply has the antagonist spout his philosophy rather than the hero as it sneaks it past the producers (see 'the bad guy was right' trope).

Still, I enjoy some of his films but even though Randian politics are interesting to discuss, I find it pathetic that Brad Bird at 60 years old is as obsessed with pushing these politics on children now as he was when he was 40 and made 'The Iron Giant'. Most people grow out of his level of adherence to politics of that kind after college at most (but then some never do; some make films with these themes for 20 years and then there is father who named his son Rand and got him into politics).",8r7d6q

""See, look, Elastigirl didn't even catch the right bad guy and now a bunch of ambassadors are dead and the Screenslaver's still loose! Supers are so unreliable!"" That's my theory on it.

EDIT: ""*And* the Screenslaver managed to hypnotize supers too?! Man, supers suck! Keep 'em illegal!""",8r7d6q
e14tv34,"> If Evelyn's brother is trying to bring supers back, why not hypnotize him or find an alternative method to stopping his supers plan (either convince him or defund his projects somehow)?

Because, by her own admission, he's the PR person she can't be. He can spin up the media circus. She's not trying to hurt supers directly; she needs to teach the public not to rely on them. She could presumably shut down her brother's campaign at any time, but why do that when she can instead let it ramp up until all eyes are on it, the moment of success is at hand, and hope in the future of supers is at its peak... and then dash that hope by destroying the summit and painting the heroes as villains on live TV that the entire world is watching, courtesy of her brother? Thereby not only sabotaging his campaign, but turning public sentiment so sharply that no one else will be able to successfully start another one.

> Why create the Screenslaver persona at all? He's been shown to publicly hypnotize people via the Elastigirl interview incident, which of course makes people act out of character. When the supers start wrecking havoc on the cruise ship, people would know that they're being mind controlled due to what has happened in the past few days (as well as their goggles).

Short answer, she's a villain and not acting entirely rationally. She's better at inventing than planning. Long answer, she counts on people thinking that the Screenslaver can only operate via broadcasts. Remember that Helen only suspected something was up with the Screenslaver because she saw the pizza delivery boy firsthand; most people would have no reason to doubt he was legit and thus no reason to come to the conclusion that people might be *wearing* the hypnotic displays as goggles.

> Adding to the previous question, why not hypnotize Elastigirl when they first met? That way Elastigirl wouldn't be able to gain public support through her activities like stopping the train. If the supers were hypnotized at the start and no one knew of the Screenslaver's mind control, then maybe Evelyn's plan could have worked.

Much easier answer here - she *wanted* Elastigirl to gain public support. She wanted her brother's summit to go ahead. She wanted peoples' faith in supers to be momentarily restored - so that when the supers turned against them, it would hit harder and create a far more impactful spectacle, demonstrating to people that they can't rely on supers (which merely stopping the summit alone wouldn't accomplish), and sabotaging not only her brother's advocacy for legalization, but everyone else's as well.",8r7d6q

That would be just like having a real super do the real crime-fighting. She was apparently close to a super-hero herself in her super-human ability to invent new products overnight, so the parallelism was there. That would have been a nice counter-point to having people like Bob stretching into a new roll in childcare.](#spoiler) But, the whole movie just didn't rise to that level of jelling around a central theme like that.

This really overdeveloped the family stuff(while not bringing much new or interesting. Violet is still chasing the same boy she got in the first one, for god's sake) while skimping too hard on the superhero plot. The villain is obvious and her motivations aren't fully developed. Dash and Mr. Incredible barely get anything to do and their powers seem heavily nerfed from the first instalment(Mr Incredible has more than the strength needed to get past those smashed pipes into the engine room. In the movie he comes across as a low-level brute, not the the highest tier hero in this world.) And no real meaningful worldbuilding takes place. 

Overall pretty disappointing to me.  ",8r7d6q

All he did in the big climax was press a button! i feel like they could have done some very interesting things with Dash's power visually especially during action scenes. well i could be biased seeing as how he had some of my favorite scenes from the original and i think super speed as an ability is super cool, but still, he didn't use his power AT ALL whereas other newer heroes used them a bunch! he had some math stuff and that's dash's story complete. went on a bit of a tangent there but cmoon think about it what did Dash even do?",8r7d6q

He probably feels some pride in spurring the moment, so to speak. Also, Winston and Evelyn told him he caused too much damage, so he was probably just embarrassed. Bob believes that being a superhero is the ONLY thing he's good at. He had a hard time giving that up again after just reviving it after 15 years.

Finally, he has a fear of Helen dying because of the events in the first film. He probably is weighing with this, too.

He is pretty harsh in the beginning, but he comes back around fairly quickly (after his 17-hour nap).

Oh, one other thought, before he becomes babysitter, he's anxious about going back to work at Insuricare or some other job. Notice he becomes much more jovial once he doesn't have to go back to work. Sure he gets envious of Elastigirl's TV coverage, but we can chalk that up to sleep deprivation and stress. ",8r7d6q

Overall I found this movie to be kind of awful. The stuff with Mr. Incredible and the kids was boring as fuck. It was dumb sitcom shit. Like stuff you'd see on Full House. I have no idea how this film is getting the reaction that it has. To me this is like Cars 2 level of bad. ",8r7d6q

Yeah. If the message from this movie was ""it takes a real hero to raise a family,"" we only see Violet actually learn that lesson. She goes from complaining about being stuck as ""the babysitter"" at the beginning of the film, and wanting to run away and do anything except be stuck holding the baby, to at the end volunteering to hold the baby to protect him if the boat crashed. Good enough arc there.

Bob survives the whole ""Mr. Mom"" ordeal well enough, but we never see that he'd be willing to do the 'women's work' again, voluntarily. He learns all these tricks about Jack-Jack while Helen is gone, so it would have been easy to see a moment where Bob corrects Helen, and says, 'no, don't give him a cookie, play this music instead' or whatever suggestion, and shows himself at least for a moment to be a capable, hands-on parent.

She has no problem in either of the movies with getting help from him, it's actually the other way around, so I'm not sure where you're getting the message of ""if you're a girl and you go to a man for help you're weak and can't stand on your own, so just do it yourself"" from.",8r7d6q

Her true motivation was easy to understand. Her father naively trusted in the heroes and she wants to save people from the delusions of her father. Her brother is going down the path of the father.

The theme of learning where to invest your trust is also reinforced by Helen's early reluctance to trust Bob to take care of the kids. When she sees how capable he is and how readily they save her, she realizes she can trust them, even though she initially had doubts.](#spoiler)

The whole time I'm just waiting there to see the Incredibles back in action and that doesn't happen until the third act. FFS the original at least gave every character some interesting scenes.

e0rb4k3,"It does has slightly ‚Äúfeminist‚Äù elements, particularly with women balancing work and home and men trying to be at home as House-husbands, but rather than calling it feminist propaganda, it‚Äôs rather just a reflection of the new and modern times that we live in and that the incredibles are shifting in, since it is assumed that they live sometime in the 60‚Äôs-70‚Äôs (minus the futuristic technology) when women working and being independent started becoming more acceptable again. With a family movie like the incredibles, it‚Äôs important to resonate, connect with, and reflect the audience that are watching it, and we live in different times where women working is even more accepted and expected, and most families aren‚Äôt in the formula of having a housewife mother, a breadwinner father, a son and a daughter. Now we have single parents, same sex parents, and parents who don‚Äôt have work that fits traditional gender roles. Although from the trailer, it seems from face value to be a super feminist since it‚Äôs a gender swapped version of the original film, but when you watch the film from beginning to end, it‚Äôs not really feminist and neither does it push it in our faces, because feminism isn‚Äôt the central theme or reason for what they‚Äôre doing. It should also be noted that Helen was offered the job of being a superhero instead of frozone or bob because she had the best record in preventing city damage in her past superhero missions Compared with bob.  The original plan was to get a fresh, friendly, popular, non aggressive or destructive superhero that would make public opinions of supers better and thus legalize superhero activity and introduce the other supers like mr incredible and frozone to work on saving the cities. Gender wasn‚Äôt a contributor to why Helen was chosen, it‚Äôs just her records and fighting style fit the situation they were in and the result they needed. If people call it blatant feminism, they‚Äôre pulling it out of their ass.
But In the end, I wouldn‚Äôt say that the incredibles franchise is mainly a superhero movie, since that‚Äôs what it advertises on the cover, but looking more deeply it‚Äôs more of a family movie that centralized things around a family that tries to navigate life, the rules of society, work, growing up, love, school, economic burdens, etc. and it shows how they change, adapt and mature as individuals and as a family throughout this, which is what makes it so relatable and beloved.

One of the things that has my fanfic-writing mind running wild is this: the Incredicar is from the 40's. (1962-15=1947) To have developed voice recognition tech, video output to CRTs, mag-lev trains, and remote controls that work from miles away, computers had to have been invented circa WWI, not WWII.

You say that inconsequential events unrelated to the plot are shoehorned into the movie purely for humor's sake, when your examples directly connect to the character's arcs. Dash's impulsiveness is a key part of his personality, and his overcoming of it is very on the nose, where he spends the whole movie ruining things by pressing random buttons and at the end has to wait to press a button until the perfect time.

Violet's arc is the same way in rediscovering her self security, which, while firstly discovered at the end of the first movie, was shattered when the Underminer fiasco threw the states of the family and Supers' legality/acceptance into shambles. On top of that she was already worried she somehow ruined her dream chance of dating Tony by revealing herself as a Super, and was thusly completely stood up when they were supposed to go out for their date. The way these things played out were sensical, funny, and moved the plot forward.

e0ux3bb,"I‚Äôm baffled, too. This movie was not fantastic or even great. I‚Äôd say it was good. 

1.	The pacing was very off which made the whole thing lack tension and importance. 
2.	There was no nuance. Everything was spoon fed and over the top (i.e. a majority of Dash‚Äôs lines being yelled. I mean he said ‚Äúyeah baby‚Äù far too much).
3.	There was no character development. Not one character became a better person at the end with the exception of Jack-Jack and possibly Edna. 
4.	The voices were too off. Craig T. Nelson sounds his age, as well as Holly Hunter. The new Dash voice only yelled stuff. And Violet had the *same inflection with all of her lines* 
5.	There was more of a focus on ‚Äòlegality‚Äô than family. The word ‚Äòlegal‚Äô or ‚Äòillegal‚Äô came up too often. And when supers were finally legalized there was no weight in that scene. It was all ‚Äúoh here ya go. This is good right?‚Äù
6.	The action was really good. 
7.	I‚Äôve kind of touched on this but the characters actual lines felt so out of place for who I remembered them as. They felt like totally different characters in a different universe. When I was watching the scene where dash puts on his super suit at the end I remember thinking ‚Äúthere‚Äôs the character I know.‚Äù (Also, cringe line of the movie from Frozone: ‚ÄùYou good then *long pause followed by weird delivery* right?
8.	Weak villains with a weak backstory.
9.	Also, after Mr. Incredible has the revelation that family is everything in the first, he suddenly gets grumpy at his wife for becoming successful? What the shit was that. 
10. Void was incredibly annoying (yes, she may represent fans who are actually like that but that does not mean that they make good characters. Especially since she was tripping over everything that she was saying). All of the other new supers had zero depth. 
11. This movie had zero depth. There was an awkward part at the end when Mr. Incredible tried to interrupt the fight to say something nice to Violet and it felt so off putting.
12. Seeing Gazerbeam was pretty cool.

I don't see how it's a rehash at all, either. Syndrome wanted everyone to be super because he was neglected and could never become what he wanted to be. Screenslaver wanted people's trust in supers to be destroyed because her father's trust in them got him killed unnecessarily. I don't see how it's similar, other than ""bad guy wants bad things to happen to good guys,"" which is pretty much the crux of superhero stories. 

As for the action sequences, I thought them being similar helped show character progression. In the beginning, they didn't work together, and so they couldn't get the job done well enough, *and* the bad guy got away. In the second one, Elastigirl could do the job by herself, but she couldn't get the bad guy, so it didn't solve the problem.

There wasn't even much mystery to who the villain was.  It was going to be one of the two new people.

e0u2ooe,"1. You oversimplifying the final fight sequence can be done to the first movie as well. Helen presses a button and kills the robot, Bob throws a car at Syndrome and accidentally kills him, Frozone doesn't do anything of use. The moral of this story was ""Don't solely rely on other people, sometimes you can do it yourself"".

2. Yeah I'll give you this one.

3. You and everyone else who think Bobs plot is ""men can't take care of kids"" is a moron. The whole point of the baby plot is NO ONE can take care of a kid with 50 super powers alone. If Helen was at home, she would be in the exact same boat. Don't project your insecurities just because you can't see past your own sexism against men. Violet took care of the baby because someone had to, she learned maturity. Dash was 99% pointless yes. Elastigirl leaves her family and freaks out when she thinks there is a problem with Jack-jack and immediately wants to come home. You are once again ignoring facts to push your stupid bias against a character. She, several times, wants to come home and be there for her family but she can't. Oh and btw, she faked the Hypoxia to defeat the villain, but of course you couldn't see that through the weird hardon you have for hating this movie.

4. ""The baby should have done something intelligent and been useful!!!!"" It's a fucking baby with superpowers, he's not Stewie. The point of Jack-jack is an unpredictable variable that can't be avoided. Jack-jack cannot be taken care of by normal means, that's the point of the device that tracks him. He is too much to handle for a single person, and Bob being a man has nothing to do with it. The raccoon scene was to showcase his powers and sell more toys, plain and simple.

5. A family dealing with almost being homeless or doing a job that they hated so much. A brother and sister whose parents were murdered because they relied too much on heroes to save them. NO ONE (not just Bob) could take care of Jack-jack, it had nothing to do with him being a man or an idiot. Math has been changed since you were in school, you'd be pretty pissed too if someone completely changed something and you had to relearn a new system in order to teach your kid something you already know. Yeah, it's hard when the government comes in and fucks with the brains of the people around you.

6. Her parents died because her father believed supers are the solution to everything, and her mother tried to solve the problem herself but her husband wouldn't let her, and they both died because of it. She wanted to make Elastigirl famous again so that she could show the world that supers aren't outlawed because they are expensive, they are outlawed because they are evil, dangerous, and will kill you because they think they are better than you. And as for that last point, why don't you refer to your own comment in 5., you want adult themes, but not THESE adult themes. Stop cherry picking.",8r7d6q
e0txgsw,"I completely agree with most of the statements here. You have valid points, and honestly I didn't really like the movie that much. I probably was expecting too much?

Although your delivery of an almost perfect review makes it seems like just plain hate and might turn off some readers and disregard everything you put in.

Number 6 really hit the nail in the head here. I kinda was expecting the motivations and methods of the villain to be much more elaborate, less plot holes, and more mature since the movie wants to cater towards the generation(who are probably now in their late teens to late 30s) that watched and enjoyed the first one.

It's not really THAT bad, but it's kinda disappointing, roughly 6.5/10 for me

> 
> Heroes are banned, why doesn't the villain just leave them banned and refuse to help her brother?

After the events of the first film plus her brother's passion and resources, there was a possibility of supers being accepted by the public again. She wanted to undermine that.
> 
> The villain is a wealthy and intelligent inventor who wants to break the law and risk killing thousands of people on the train so she can restore superheroes to the spotlight just so she can get them banned again?

Correct. She's trying to affect societal change.
> 
> And the reason she hates superheroes has to be the biggest reach in any movie. Her father rang a Superhero line after the superheros were made illegal. How can she possibly blame superheros? If superheroes had been legal they might have saved her father. But she doesn't blame the people who made them illegal, she doesn't blame the criminals who shot her father, she wants to blame superheros who were not even involved in the incident in any way...

It was more the mindset of her father that he first turned to the supers rather then trying to solve the problem himself (by getting himself and his wife somewhere safe). She mentions this attitude is everywhere in society and that's what she's fighting against.

e19f55d,"> A. Generic train scene with overused parachute transforming superpower
> 
> B. Amazing visual fight scene with Screenslaver, only to be rendered pointless when you find out its a Pizza Boy (and even more infuriating when you question how Elastigirl could even be mildly challenged by a scrawny pizza boy)
> 
> C. Pretty good rescue scene of the ambassador (I‚Äôll give you this one Brad).

A. This train scene is meant to highlight the difference in Helen and Bob's crimefighting styles, especially if you compare it to the train scene from the first movie.  Bob's only method was to stop the train outright (though to his credit there was a long string of coincidences that led to him having to save the train in the first place), but Helen could actually slow it down without damaging nearly *anything*.

B. It's not pointless, it's all part of the real Screenslaver's plan.  And to be fair, Elastigirl *couldn't see her opponent all that well*, given the flashing, disorienting lights, and the fact that he came armed with a cattle prod that temporarily disabled her powers.

C. Nothing to say here, we agree.

As for everything else, Evelyn doesn't just want to make supers illegal.  She *hates* them, and blames her father's dependency on them for his death.  She wants to make it so that *nobody* would *ever* want supers in any sort of position of power *ever again* by making them seem like they were going to rise up in rebellion and turn evil.  And that takes a bit more planning that manipulating the media's perception of supers, since that was already at an all-time low.  If Winston wasn't so gung-ho to bring supers back, she might not have been doing much of anything at all.

Evelyn claims to want to make the world better, not by doing anything good, but by removing what she hates and perceives as a problem.  She doesn't care who gets hurt in the process; she wants everyone to agree with her and to see her point of view.  She *could* simply hypnotize everyone, but we see that the effects of her hypnosis only last so long as they're looking at a screen, and the spell is broken when they look away for a minute.  The hypnosis also doesn't seem to have any brainwashing effects after its initial use.  And...well, Evelyn didn't exactly count on a psychic baby trying to find her mama, did she?  (Honestly, what villain would have?)

And lastly, about the fight scene in the plane.  Sure, she doesn't have powers, but she's using the altitude and resulting lack of oxygen to weaken Elastigirl.  Can't fight if you can't breathe.  Then she gets cocky and starts monologuing and Helen shoots her air tank with a fucking flare gun.",8r7d6q
e1a2rki,"A: Mr. Incredible stops a train in the first one, so Elastigirl is stopping one in the sequel to show they are both up to the challenge, albeit with different power sets and approaches.

B: Disorientating (and actually seizure inducing) light patterns to keep Elastigirl off balance and a shock baton to subdue her. It was never supposed to defeat Elastigirl, just throw her off the trail of the true villain. It failed because Elastigirl is a detective not an avenger.

C: It was good, but I think the battle vs the Underminer is the highlight, if only because he's a more bombastic villain. 

I think part of the trouble with Evelyn is her having to be a 'secret' evil genius, keeping that secret from her brother while she goes about her agenda. Syndrome never really had to hide from anyone 'close' to him. He just set up his lair on a remote island and turned himself into something of a bond villain. 

Evelyn's goggles are about as effective as it gets without turning it into 'The Super in the Iron Mask' type of deal where the inconspicuous nature is sacrificed for more reliability and durability. She's captured the Supers and turned them into her drones so it's not like she's afraid of any normies freeing them.  

She just doesn't have the same 'punch' as Jason Lee's Syndrome, but she's adequate and her back and forth with Elastigirl is good. 

The main issue is while it's an incredibly well executed sequel it's entirely similar to the first, maybe too similar.  ",8r7d6q
e19kl2m,"**SPOILERS!!!!**

The villian is an outstanding weak point that nearly kills the film. The character design alone seems entirely out of place in this universe. She would have felt lazy even in a Dreamworks production. Who is this modeled after; Chris Jenner? Everything else in the film is retro or retro-futuristic and then you have this character who seems modeled after a Real Housewife? It doesn't make sense. I could have overlooked this huge error if her motivations and methods weren't so muddy. Like you pointed out, her methods did not make sense.

I was really excited to hear that the film would start right where the last one left off. It's a perfect continuation for an animated film as no one ages. That said, after the Underminer gets away and then is never heard from again, the whole idea of starting there felt really pointless. It was an exhilarating opening but it ultimately felt lazy not to do more with the Underminer. I would have much rather had him as the villain throughout than Chris Jenner.

The other thing that is nagging me is why wouldn't Dicker tell the Parrs about Jack Jack's powers. Did he not have to erase the babysitter's memory from the first film? I just felt like the whole ""jack jack has powers?"" narrative felt redundant and needless. Jack Jack was great but we didn't need everyone being shocked by his powers again. We, the audience, already had that revelation and it seemed obvious that the Parrs finally knew that given his attack on Syndrome and his antics with the babysitter. Also, why didn't Bob and Violet understand from the get that her date's memory would be erased. Even if they overlooked something so obvious it should have been realized very quickly. Violet is no slouch - don't play her for a fool. I can accept that Bob is overwhelmed and absent-minded but not Violet. I can accept this as a quibble but it feels like something the first film wouldn't have succumbed too. There is an overall laziness with these plot points and drags the film down. The first was bouyant because it didn't feel like it was short on ideas, those ideas were pletiful enough to extend into a seamless continuation.

The action is a high point but there was nothing here as revoltionary as the first film. It's simply bigger and more expensive. The retro futurism also feels more watered-down. The extent of the stylization in the first film felt bold and it was a character unto itself that really fleshed-out the world the Parrs live in. They should have pushed that stylization even further. It really felt a little self conscious this time around. Which, given the success of the first, makes no sense. It was that boundary pushing that made it feel so fresh. That is basically absent from the second. It feels less confident in the risks the first film took 14 years ago.

Ultimately it is an acceptable film and the great characters established in the first film prevent it from truly faltering. I'll give it points too, for establishing imaginative secondary heroes. While they were ultimately one-dimensional they did have entertaining powers that made for some fun action.

Negative points for showing unnecessary alcohol consumption in a kid's film. Why have Elastigirl having multiple drinks? Seemed like a really shallow attempt to be relevant to adults. If it was somehow handled in a clever way I'd accept it but it really just seemed pointless and kind of irresponsible. Total Dreamworks move.

Unfortunately I have to say this was a missed opportunity and given the time it took between the two it's more than reasonable to have expected more thoughtfullness out of the script especially with the original creators involved.

The Villainess is the poster child of Intersectional Feminism desires and hubris.

In the conversation between Elastigirl/Mrs. Incredible and herself about men, their attitudes were completely different and pretty much illustrates feminism vs 3rd wave intersectional feminism that relies on post modern structure of thought. That entire conversation and the way in which the final segment of the movie resolved pretty much proved to me that this film is Anti 3rd wave feminist in nature while also being pro feminism at the same time. It was brilliant and gave me further context as to why the villainess was so much less interesting than Syndrome.

I don't think these traits were consistently displayed throughout the whole movie. At the beginning he was obviously jealous of his wife's fame and he was also definitely overwhelmed with taking care of the kids on his own seeing as he had never done it before. Over the movie I believe his jealousy faded and once he settled more into the dad role (starting when he stays up all night to learn math and then helps Dash), he was much more comfortable.

That's a realistic time span for her to become less shy.

Mind you these on characters usually end up looking like cheesy overkill and have bad design, like characters having blatantly strange hairstyles, or dying their hair to be different, or having freckles to seem unique and shy but not flawlessly pretty because they have freckles, and a few piercings or a tattoo to be edgy. They usually don‚Äôt have unique bodily or facial structures so the only thing that is unique about them is their clothing and hair choices, which makes them look like cheap obviously inspired versions of the better designed original characters like bob and Helen.

""He learns to deal with the baby though!"" ...he gives it constant cookies but other than that, not really. Edna learns how to deal with it. He drops the baby off to get sleep. And he doesn't have a real progression through the Violet arc, either, that just ends unexpectedly and she forgives him for no particular reason. It was all... fine but ultimately his entire side of the film was unnecessary.

""Helen learns"" nothing? She's cool throughout but her only real crisis is stopping the villain. They could have explored her missing her family or guilt at ""leaving"", etc. Maybe relate it to the villain who feel guilt for her own family! But her scenes mostly focus on action instead. Fun to watch, but not a character arc.

Dash does nothing at all. Violet is teen embarassed but does hardly anything for plot. Even the *baby* didn't really do anything! Sure he pulled the first glasses off, but come on. Anyone could have done that. Why couldn't it be something Bob taught the baby specifically? Why couldn't Bob's time taking care of the kids enabled them to work together in that moment instead of largely bumping around the ship aimlessly.

Frozone and Edna were fine, though, about as cool and useful as in the first film. No character arc there either--but they didn't have one in the first film and are side characters anyway. It was fine.

Oh, you didn't forget. But you cited Bomb Voyage, an equally forgettable and disposable annoyance? I'm confused.

It's not about the supers not answering the phone; it's about people being too dependent on them in the first place.

> Also, I perceived there to be an overarching problem with Bao. The metaphor doesn't quite work unless we are seeing through the eyes of the mother. The bao child *IS* vulnerable. Getting hit by the soccer ball smushes its head. Because of that, we view the bao as vulnerable because physical activity will literally kill it. As a result, the more I thought about the short the less I thought it worked.

Mr. Incredible and Frozone both have powers that tend to cause a lot of collateral damage in the process of stopping the bad guy, whereas Elastigirl's power is less destructive and allows for more finesse. Since the collateral damage thing was what got superheroes banned in the first place, it made sense from a PR perspective to lead with Elastigirl. 

IMO, it makes perfect sense and doesn't feel forced at all. Like, again, the precipitating event for supers being banned was Mr. Incredible causing a bunch of collateral damage with his highly destructive superpower. Why would they use *him* as the center of a PR campaign designed to convince the public that superheroes are helpful and necessary and won't wreck all their shit?",8r7d6q
e0ul9co,"I agree with your point about checkboxes, this movie felt very methodical about hitting certain talking points but they seem so poorly written in.

Whats bad is the Female lead story would make far more sense if the movie was actually set 14 years later in the '80s' where it would mimic the real social changes we saw. That would also allow for some character development between the films which would make sense, instead we get it shoehorned in with this movie taking place immediately after the first. ",8r7d6q
e0uha4y,"I actually don‚Äôt understand why you think it‚Äôs the same plot. It‚Äôs really not. Elastigirl wasn‚Äôt trying to escape her boring life or return to her glory days. Mr. Incredible‚Äôs journey revolved around being less selfish and think of others more, which was highlighted in how he treated Syndrome.

Meanwhile, Elastigirl is working as an advocate for superheroes - something she didn‚Äôt even want to do since it was breaking the law. But then it was pointed out how it would significantly impact people‚Äôs futures and their rights, so she did it. In both movies it showed that she loved being a superhero but she didn‚Äôt need to be like Mr. Incredible.

Even the reason they picked Elastigirl made sense. Mr. Incredible showed how competitive he could be in the first movie and it made sense in how that can result in harming others. They needed to pick one so they picked the one that would treat it like a business and yes, would result in less damage because of the nature of her powers.

Hell, what Elastigirl does in this movie is completely different from Mr. Incredible in the last one. She‚Äôs actively trying to solve a mystery and find the villain. Mr. Incredible didn‚Äôt even know there was a villain or something to investigate. She worked to solve hers - he stumbled into it. 

And the villains motivations were completely different. One wanted to supply people with super powers and the other wanted to completely do away with them. As Syndrome said ‚Äúthey‚Äôre only super due to birth but everyone should be able to.‚Äù Meanwhile, Evelyn believed that having superheroes around made people less likely to help themselves.

My dad was the stay-at-home parent, so I really liked that they put Mr. Incredible in that role and discussed his anxieties, without ever making it about gender.

His subplot is meant to take him out of his comfort zone and put him through the ringer.

Helen rediscovers her love of helping people through hero work, but I do think her arc got short-changed at the end. I would've loved to see some sort of resolution to it, especially when her ""I missed Jack-Jack's first power??"" line seemed to be heading in that direction. Something about balancing work and family.

Violet's boyfriend story is a bit more slight, but she also has a running plot of being the one to watch Jack-Jack. Initially she feels this role is demeaning, but like Bob watching the family, she discovers the inherent reward with being a protector and accepts that role in the family on the ship. (Bob: ""That's my girl."") This one's a bit subtle but it is there and I didn't catch it immediately.

The government-backed evil shoehorned into this theory really weakens it. 

And the rest of it doesn't work either. The Deavors are in telecommunications, not arms dealing.

She needs to prevent him from succeeding in order to keep supers illegal.

The parts with the baby were funny, but for the most part it felt pandering and so obviously a political statement. The villian's motive made no sense. And I could see it coming from a mile away. It should have been about the whole family being superheroes. I don't think Violet even used her powers until 30 minutes before the film ended. Wtf. =\

In the first, you get the retro-future design of the house, cars, clothes, etc. You get the james-bondy music which feels perfect. You get the action and danger from the cool weapons. And the story is really condensed.

Every scene in the first movie is fun, from the shape of the characters features (remember Bob's insurance company boss?), to the voices, to the acting, to the design of the furniture. And something as throw-away as the back of the computer in his insurance company cubicle was great to look at.

You also get the back-story of supers in general. You get a good villainous pair with Syndrome and Mirage. And last but not least you get Edna Mode.

With the new movie, you don't really see anything new except for Jack-Jack. And the villain is weak.

I didn't notice the pie thing, so I can't speak to that.

And honestly, Elastigirl would have struggled just as much in the parenting role as Bob did. She was supported by everyone because she is doing something far bigger than taking care of children.

e0tb1dy,"I think most of it felt in line with the plot. Mr Incredible is used to being a hero and at work, he was never the stay at home parent and that type of thing takes adjustment.

And Elastigirl being the face of the super movement is because Mr Incredible is a loose cannon. In both movies he consistently causes collateral damage because he's too strong/reckless. In the first movie he rips a giant tree out of the ground to save a cat out of a tree (and stop the bad guys in the car chase but still).",8r7d6q

I mean all of the scenes with Mr. Incredible feels like stuff you'd see on fucking Full House. It was that bad and that dumb, and how much goddamn time did they waste on that shit. It added NOTHING to the plot and didn't really develop Mr. Incredible that much. I never really feel like he actually became a good dad, just that he was trying his best, which would never be enough.

Also the entire concept of focusing on Elastagirl is incredibly broken. This movie is like if you made a Fantastic Four film, the the sequel just focused on Mr. Fantastic and all the other characters did absolutely nothing to affect the plot. 

I think if this film were shorter and cut out nearly all of the bad mad soccer dad scenes with Mr. Incredible then it would have been a lot better. But the whole movie I was just waiting to see The Incredibles (the goddamn title of the fucking movie) in action. This movie should have just been called Elstagirl because the incredibles do nothing for nearly the whole film

But misandry and incompetent men in the new status quo of movies now. Look at The Last Jedi and you see the exact same shit. And for fuck sake Kimmy Schmit has probably the most misandrist thing I have seen in a long time, where she writes a childrens book where ""men are born with a monster in them, and they have to learn to control that monster"". So yeah Kimmy you just effectively called all men monsters, fuck that and fuck the writers who think that's okay to do.

""[The movie] alarms the almost unanimous adoration of the American critic, to which it is enough to give it a varied cast so that it is incapable of judging a film because of its formal and aesthetic merits. As viewers, we should care less about the inclusive mood of a film - which can also be a publicity stunt - than its quality. **It is as if Disney had already given an infallible formula: to represent minorities to evade the judgment of the reviewer, who prefers to praise something medium than to reveal himself as insensitive.**""

e252xsf,"This is, in a way, my own review of the Incredibles 2. Loved the movie. I have much more to say about it, but for lack of time and effort, here is my response to the above comment:

I have a TON of problems with your review. You seem to expect a utopia and perfect character traits in the protagonists, an expectation hugely disconnected from reality. You also seem to misinterpret several parts of the movie.

1) On your criticism of Mr. Incredible: the movie showed he tried very hard to be supportive of his wife and her success. His own ego, which is part of his character and arguably a result of his superpowers giving him strength AND confidence, prevented him from being genuinely happy for her BEHIND her back. Doesn't mean he didn't want to be happy for her. It also shows the reality of male ego, nay, human ego, a trait that induces jealousy. Perfectly natural and not misogynistic at all. If he actively undermined and insulted her to promote himself in front of the Deavors, I would agree he is selfish and misogynistic. Instead, Mr. Incredible was supportive but jealous of his wife's success.

On his parenting: He tried hard, that much was obvious. Note the late nights and bags under his eyes when he studied math to help Dash. You may argue that it's his fault for being incompetent, a result of his terrible parenting ability, but that just shows your unrealistic expectations. Parenting is hard (you probably don't understand that), and it takes time to get better at it and used to it. Admittedly, he should be a better parent at this point, but as a working dad in the past (insurance salesman or whatever), he was not the main stay at home parent. Nothing wrong with that, just how it was written and how real life generally is. Additional points: he read books to Jack-Jack, prepared breakfast, encouraged his wife over the phone to boost her confidence, hid problems from his wife so she didn't have to worry. You would probably say all these things are unimpressive, though.

2) On your criticism of Violet's portrayal: you really had a problem with the ice cream stereotype. Maybe I'm the misogynist here, but I'm pretty sure that is a very common coping technique, displayed all over social media in memes, personal anecdotes, etc. Sorry to mention Dad again, but he tried to provide emotional support. Though he sucked at it like most dads would. And he tried, even opening up to her in the movie, apologizing for not being good enough. But you missed that sweet moment, huh?

To continue, did you not watch the end when she gathered the courage to approach her crush, Tony, and introduce herself NORMALLY? Seems like you missed the actual unrealistic point of the movie, instead choosing to criticize the parts that make sense. Btw, I loved that scene because even as a guy, I wish I could be that person and make the move, but most can agree it rarely happens, guys or girls. 

3) On your criticism of Representation: yea it sucks minorities aren't showcased so much. But it's even worse when diversity is forced. Incredibles 1 was released in 2004, a period of much less political correctness. Even today it hasn't gotten much better, but the sequel should stay true to the prequel, imo. There is nothing wrong to make a movie about a white family, either. We are in America, the majority of people here are white. Get your head outta your ass. On Frozone running from the cops: thank god they made him the only one to escape. Imagine the uproar if he was the only one caught LMAO. On the family moving into the ""huge house for no reason"": they were sponsored by a corporation and a personal rich fanboy. 

Finally, I want to say that by seeing the negatives, the ugly parts of a NORMAL (I stress normal not in reference to their superpowers) family, I pray that parents and kids have the self-awareness, the open-mindedness, to reflect on themselves and realize they can improve and be better to their own family. That's a tall order to fill, though. It's incredibly hard and rare, traits that enable people to push aside ego and practice empathy. I'm guilty of it myself.

Helen is understanding of this and sympathetic to it. There's no obnoxious ""So you don't think a WOMAN can do as good a job as a MAN!?"" line by her. By and large, they keep gender out of it and it strengthens both Bob and Helen as characters because of it.

Now, they do bring it up a bit with Evelyn...but [she's the VILLAIN](#spoiler). She keeps making these little jabs at Bob and Helen's family holding her back, but Helen is actually defensive of this and doesn't trash her husband. She's sensitive to what he needs and even apologizes for some phrasing that might hurt him, etc. 

I do kind of agree that the ""slap on the wrist"" line kind of came out of nowhere and didn't have anything to really do with the movie's themes. If anything, the ""mean rich guy"" trope was inverted since he was one of their best allies.",8r7d6q

Further, just because the story was pushing that Helen was arguably the better Superhero and that she doesn‚Äôt have to be a stay-at-home Mom, it was also poking holes in the idea that Dad‚Äôs can‚Äôt/ aren‚Äôt capable of being the primary caretaker.

e0s2t0f,"The point of Bob's story was to put him through the ringer despite his nigh-invincibility (which I also suspect was why they had him be involved in a very real threat at the end that his super-strength couldn't help--nearly drowning). 

I don't think the movie was trying to make it a gender-based thing; it's just that Bob has had more experience being the guy who is more along the ""work"" side of the work/family balance, so having him take care of the kids (especially Jack-Jack) is a way to give the character some new struggles.

The bun becomes more and more like her child, even to the point that it is rebelling from her.

I've been thinking about exactly that since I saw the movie, and I must at least partially disagree.

The shadows of the burglars were already on the walls when her father was starting the second phone call. Even if he had shaken his wife awake and rushed them to the safe room the instant he had become aware there was something wrong, it's not guaranteed he would have made it. And what about his kids? He definitely wouldn't have had time to run through the house shouting for them and evading the burglars at the same time.

Winston was wrong too. Even if supers had been legal back then, neither Gazerbeam nor Fironic were shown to be super fast, so they couldn't have arrived before Mr. Deavor got shot.

What would have saved the Deavors was better physical security around their house (e.g. bulletproof windows), or pretending to be asleep so the burglars would have made off with their stuff without any violence.

However, his means was to create death robots as destructive billboards to market his products, and his ulterior motives were both to amass enormous wealth as well as remove actual supers from the limelight as revenge for being snubbed by Mr. Incredible.  

Eveline's goal was to remove the dependence on Supers to force humanity to fend for themselves, strengthening them. Her means were to assassinate global ambassadors, dozens of supers, and possibly hundreds of people by crashing the largest boat ever into the city.

When the brother explains that if heroes were not outlawed then their parents would still be alive. Immediately the sister reacts saying that the parents could have just saved themselves instead. At that moment It was obvious who had motives to do away with heroes.

Then throughout the rest of the film Bird just laid on the imagery pretty thick. Too much obvious foreshadowing.

I thought having a kind and helpful character from the first movie be the villain would have been a bold choice.

I agree they need to cool it with the surprise villains. I feel like it got such a good reception in Frozen that now they're just doing it everywhere. Coco was the only other movie I've seen do something really interesting with the concept.",8r7d6q
e0u9asz,Yeah the villain was incredibly obvious. I'm surprised they didn't take it one step further and have Win be the villain as well. Remember how he was the CEO of a telecom company?

> Edit: To clarify since I'm getting downvoted, I've come to expect the villain twist in most Disney/PIXAR produced movies, because it's been happening so frequently that it's become easy to predict. It happened with Up, Toy Story 3, Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, Zootopia, Coco, even as far back as Toy Story 2 and Monsters Inc with Stinky Pete and Mr. Waternoose. When I see a masked villain in the trailers for Incredibles 2, as well as an eccentric business man character (voiced by the same guy who plays Saul Goodman, no less), my immediate thought is ""well, this guy seems like the most likely person, but it's probably not him because that would be *too* predictable."" As soon as the sister came on screen, and one of her first on-screen bits of dialogue is arguing with her brother about what caused the death of their parents, it became incredibly obvious what was going to happen later.",8r7d6q

e0vc3jw,"That's understandable, but it's these kinds of compromises that result in movies being way too formulaic.  Not a big deal for a kid's movie since they haven't seen countless movies where a good guy turns out to be the bad guy, but kind of a let-down for experienced movie-goers.  It wouldn't be the end of the world if they actually had a readily identifiable villain and gave him some real character development.",8r7d6q
e0u2seq,"I feel like you have to do it this way.  You either reveal the villain as one of main characters OR introduce the baddie as a baddie right upfront which can easily lead to scene where they capture the hero and monologue to them about their dastardly plan, as well as their tragic motivations (like so many Bond villains).  This was parodied and defied in the first Incredibles movie.  Or you have the villain be captured instead which leads to them monologuing at the hero from inside a cage / glass box which is so done to death, but you still see it (its even in the new Mission: Impossible trailer).  You have to have the hero and villain talk to each other.  There are only so many ways to organically accomplish that, especially when these people would, otherwise, immediately start fighting.

It's a little unnecessarily negative to imply that only people that are inherently special are allowed to be celebrated for achievement, especially when genuine talent is often celebrated much more than mediocrity. Participation trophies exist, sure, and that's an issue worth talking about, but it isn't as if we stopped awarding first place trophies. The exceptional are still considered exceptional, but the movie implies that's not the case.

I mean, think about the fact that the supers are born special and the only guy in the movie that worked hard to make himself special is the villain. Makes you reanalyze it a bit.

Especially the thing with how the Dev's father died just seems strange to me. It doesn't really even make sense that an intelligent person like Evelyn would blame all supers for what happened, but if it was like a collateral damage thing or an indirect consequence of the supers it would make way more sense, and that just seems obvious to me from a writing standpoint. I'm almost sure they had to have avoided that on purpose for some reason, to the movie's detriment.

If I had to try to write a sequel to the Incredibles from scratch I would have no idea where to start and it would suck big time.

And I agree, Frozone was in the new movie a lot more than the original but you can never get too much of Lucious. He was a whole lot more badass in the new movie.

And humanity gets dependent on lots of things. Let's say they make electricity illegal tomorrow. If your father dies because you depended on your security system, do you blame electricity? No, because it was a dumb choice to get rid of something so reliably because someone got hurt (nevermind the fact that by doing nothing, the super villain would do even more damage)

Im not sure I'm getting my point across. It's two hours past my bedtime. I'm probably rambling incoherently. It just seems she's misattributing her anger of her fathers death. She has terrible motivation.  But otherwise she checks all the boxes as a great villain.

However, I expect something completely different if there is a third one.",8r7d6q
e1h7t59,"I saw the movie a few days ago and have been struggling to digest it/figure out its themes--I like this analysis a lot. The themes of the first movie were definitely more overt, but the second takes a different approach by making everything a little more subtle, and you're right; this issue of trust *definitely* is the DNA of the film. Another big key-in was when Helen captured by Screenslaver, and Screenslaver said something along the lines of ""you don't know me! A fancy presentation and a few gadgets and you think we're *friends?*"" At first I thought Helen's arc was learning to be a a superhero again while Bob essentially was a mirror--learning to be a father again. But Helen fell back into hero work pretty damn quick, and being a mom never hindered that (think--we got a little taste with her having to tell Dash where to find something under the bed while on the chase, but it never got in her way).

So, what if her arc ***was*** a mirror, but not of Bob's--of the Screenslaver's? Helen and Screenslaver actually start out in similar headspaces, not trusting/wanting supers to return. But while Screenslaver is stagnant, Helen grows. Screenslaver's trust in supers was destroyed, while Helen's is restored (""at least I *have* core beliefs!""). I'd say the thesis of the film (and Helen's arc) is: ***Blind trust is destructive, but trust (in your family) is necessary;*** blind trust in a stranger nearly gets Helen killed by the Screenslaver. But while the Screenslaver had a valuable lesson to teach, she took it too far (of course, as all villains have to, in order to make them a villain). Screenslaver undermined (no pun intended) her own argument of ""we shouldn't trust heroes"" by proving once and for all to Helen that supers are needed, and sorely.

Still, trust is a fickle thing, and you have to be careful where you put it. That doesn't mean trust is bad, as Helen starts off the film believing. She doesn't trust heroes, and she doesn't trust her own family (the ""we can only count on each other"" line. But you gotta trust someone, and you gotta be smart about it. You have to be careful and put your trust in the right places, in the right people, like your family. If Screenslaver's dad had trusted his wife, they would have been alive today. Likewise, Helen is only alive because she chooses to trust her family, a group of supers. Helen was wrong when she told Bob they could only count on each other; she can count on their kids to take care of Jack Jack, on Bob to take care of the kids, on Frozone to take care of everyone, and they can count of supers to save the city, and on and on and on. Blind faith is dangerous. But faith itself, especially faith in your family, is indispensable.",8r7d6q

It was so perfectly planned I thought there was no way it wasn't both of the siblings plan from the get go.

Even some of the worse Pixar movies had better final acts. Cars 2 had a tense and exhilarating attempt to defuse a bomb. Monsters U had some interesting attempt to scare a whole cabin of children. The first Cars had a meaningful race to conclude Lightning McQueen‚Äôs redemption arc. Sure, not all of these climaxes were bombastic or flashy, but at least there was purpose to the story, and help lift the overall story to greater heights

Dash acted out in the first movie because he didn‚Äôt have an outlet for his energy and talent. By the end of that movie, that has been resolved. In the sequel, why does he do anything? He impulsively presses buttons and causes chaos but it‚Äôs not a character flaw that evolves over the movie. Yeah, he has to wait to press a button in the final sequence but that‚Äôs not an arc. His character did not change at all. Similarly with Violet. Her arc amounts to overcoming a small series of misunderstandings. By the end of the sequel, she successfully asks out Tony, again.

Did the police/whoever just forget the fucking giant metal ball destroying everything? Was there no thank you or congratulations or any repercussions to the entire conclusion of the first film?

 How do they justify condemning the incredibles again despite saving lives and fucking skyscrapers? Because they had plans in place to catch the Underminer after he robs a bank and destroys a city?

Also his abilities still seem quite poorly defined as a whole and the movie does not do a good job handling his attributes. For example, we don't know if he can walk or not.

The moral of this story is don't solely rely on other people you can do it yourself? If that's true (which I don't think it is) than that is in complete opposition of what the first movie taught us (that family and working together is the key to success) and simply illustrates how bad the overall message of this movie is. I'm really saddened if this is the true message of the movie, especially because Bob never learns this lesson, he can't seem to do a single thing on his own in this movie.

2. skip

3. What insecurities and what sexism? If they want to do the Mr Mom trope, fine, but I want to see something come out of it. Bob is a bad parent, ok, so what does he learn? Nothing. He has one brief moment in which he does Math better, that's about it. His revelation with Violet is admitting he is a bad parent, this doesn't actually show any improvement like how Bob solves the Math. It just shows that he knows he is incompetent, wow great. His solution for Jack Jack is also nothing, Jack Jack gets a new suit and Bob gets to fall asleep. That's it. I'm upset the story puts him in a position with problems to solve and then never truly lets him overcome them (Edna even tells Bob to stop giving Jack Jack cookies, but he still does in the next scene anyway). There could've been a scene where his daughter is too shy to talk to a boy and he does a mock date with her or something and they bond. I don't know, anything. I'm sorry when I say I expect more of the characters and you decide to say it must be something about my own personal insecurities, lol how does that work?
There is one single scene where Elastic Girl cares about what might be happening at home and in 10 seconds it shows she really doesn't care that much, because the entire time she is holding in how excited she was to stop a train. If this is good enough for you, then fine, so her attachment to her family is brought up halfway through the film, never mentioned again except for one throw away line at the end when she realizes Jack Jack has powers. When she is caught in the freezer she never mentions her family either, well she might, I don't remember because the dialogue was so awkward in this scene because I was trying to use my full mental capacity to piece together whatever the villains motives were at this point, couldn't and this is when I really started giving up on the movie.
Your final claim that Elastic Girl was faking hypoxia is the most absurd thing I've read yet, no where else have I ever seen anyone bring this up. If this is true then what was the point? She has powers, the other girl doesn't, she could've just punched her. Why would she need to fake hypoxia, that makes absolutely no sense lol. I think you might need to see this scene again, she is not faking it (if she was she also wouldn't need to make a quick dash for the air mask right after defeating the villain)


4. I didn't claim the baby doesn't need to do anything intelligent and useful, I do however claim that the scenes he is in should require some sort of purpose in the movie. The fight with the raccoon does absolutely nothing for the plot or the characters. It's a 10 minute throw away gag in a movie that's already long. Then they use these same gags again when he's with his father, or when he is running around on the boat (also throw away). Take this idea instead for an example. Instead of fighting with the raccoon, Jack jack fights with several guards or enemy super heros on the boat, saving the family from a dire situation. You get the same scene, but instead this time, there is some weight behind it. Here is another idea You could even give him the power of aging, like Gon from Hunter X Hunter, make him age up to 30 and use his powers competently to fight a bunch of enemies and have cool, meaningful scene. This would show to Bob that although Jack jack is a handful, one day Jack jack will grow up to do great things. This would bring a conclusion to both their character arcs. 


5. I agree, the consequences are heavier at the beginning, I enjoy that part, where they struggle with what to do as a family and ultimately decide to allow Elastic Girl to go out (despite the fact this didn't work out so well in the first movie, but whatever I guess). This falls apart later as I have already explained elsewhere ad nauseam, I think I have already addressed what I think of all these other points you bring up.


6. She wants to make elastic girl famous again to prove they are dangerous? Public damages is only HALF the reason Supers went illegal. It is already said in the first movie that Mr Incredible was sued because of the harm he did to the people he saved on the train and saving the suicide man. It was already established that public opinion of super heroes was that they were a nuisance. Honestly Screenslaver's plan is so convoluted. Of course Syndrome's is too, but you can see the metaphor behind it at least. Maybe the plot would have been better off if after saving the city in the first one from the giant metal robot, Supers were made legal again, and Screenslaver wants to make them illegal. 
See my point for 3 again for this movie. Bob has a relatable theme about the difficulties of being a parent, however it isn't told in an interesting way (solving math and boy problems doesn't use powers) and once again I feel like there is no solution to his character arc. Before you for some reason call me an insecure sexist again, let's contrast this with Bob from the first movie. He is an idiot in that movie, lies to his wife, acts childish because of a midlife crisis, puts his boss in a hospital bed, is an adrenaline junky, puts his family in danger and so forth.

He had obvious anti-social behaviors that made him the villain. Even though the trigger for him becoming the villain was so small, it was believable because of the character development of his personality (a popular trope of an egotistical person being ignored turns evil).

But the villian in number 2... She would have to be a psychopath to pull that train stunt. She had no obvious character flaws, except we eventually find out that secretly she had been performing heinously monstrous actions (killing thousands of people on a train). It was only obvious one of the siblings was going to be the villain because there was no one else brought into the story to fit.

I disagree on the villains plot not making sense. Eveyln didn't want supers to simply be illegal. She wanted society to reject them completely. If heroes are crutches for society she didn't want people to merely toss them aside. She wanted society to burn them to a crisp. 

     
She used her brother's PR campaign to get supers to come into the light, and wanted to use the incident on the boat to start a normal v super war. The type of rhetoric used by the controlled supers feels like something that would come out Magneto's splinter faction in X men. If the Parr kids hadn't escaped. All known supers would have been under her control. They could be used to reek havoc on the world, until governments take actions to remove supers permanently. If enough hate and distrust of supers was generated, governments would be imprisoning if not executing people who have powers.",8r7d6q

Also, I agree on the alcohol consumption bit. Sure one can argue that content nowadays doesn‚Äôt seem to really be bothered by the impression they‚Äôre setting, but from a studio like Pixar / Disney, you would expect something like that to not be passed from the drawing board. Especially when it adds 0 value or plot impact. 

By extension, I didn‚Äôt really feel like they ever even really drove home the fact that Mr. Incredible ever even enjoyed being able to stay home and look after the kids one bit.

At what point does ""equal rights"" become female sexism against men? Because whatever that point is, Disney has crossed it. 

Why can't movies have more females like Ridley from Alien or Jane from the recent Tarzan remake? They address that they are female and then defy their pre-set expectations by other characters and then the fact they are a woman never comes back up again. 

Growing up I was taught that Race, Gender, Religion, and Orientation didn't determine if someone is a bad/good person. But Disney seems to have trouble understanding that being a woman or ethnic (yeah, I'm looking at you Black Panther), or both (Rose) doesn't equal being an entire character.

Also, the fact that her parents died because his dad wanted to call the superheroes (at a time in which they were illegal) and they did not respond (maybe because superhereoes where once again, illegal) was a really bad excuse for making her hate superheroes.

e0uief1,"lol, I am alrady getting downvoted. You would think folks will try to prove my last paragraph point wrong, just to spite me.

To answer you thoughts. First off, I really think the whole ""supers should be illegal because they damage stuff"" narrative was already used, and really did not need to revisited. If you recall, the climax of the original movie had the parr family take on syndrome and his robot in the full glare of the public. When they killed the robot, everyone came out to congratulate them, they got a ride home in a limo which I assume was at the expense of the government. It was generally implied that everything was back to normal, and supers didn't have to be illegal again. So when the second movie comes around and uses the same plot device? straight out of the box? I don't know, it seemed a bit incoherent especially since the second movie is supposed to follow immediately after the first.

Other points- You have a super employed by a benevolent technocrat to do ""super hero"" work that may or may not be staged to serve some ulterior motive of said benefactor. We later find out that most of the super's work is infact staged, and the villain of the movie is infact the benefactor and the super was being played like a puppet all along, and everyone is a pawn in the grand chess game engineered by ouor villain to destroy supers or take over the world, or something like that.

The plot hole is when she captures him. When she does there are not cops, but it skips to when the cops show up and hes being thrown into the car going ""where am I?"". If they were forced to animate the scene right after his capture they couldn't keep the whole ""We got him"" trope. The reason being she would **immediately** confront him after capturing him. ""Who are you? Why did you do this? etc"" and he would just say ""Where am I? Whats going on?"" at that point it would be too obvious to make her say ""SAVE IT FOR THE JUDGE"" and then she walks away.

Its just bad writing at the end of the day.


>And you got the villain's motive wrong too. Her motive was to thwart her brother's plans to reinstate supers because she believed that her father died in vain (in her mind she blames supers for his death because they make people lazy about their own safety), not ""I'm going to take away my dead dad's favorite thing."" You're right, it doesn't make sense the way you phrase it - because that's not what it was.

Even if her motive wasn't shit, he character was awful. She had no fight scene. The main villain had NO FIGHT SCENE!

I mentioned that many of the, what I consider SJW, lines and jabs could in reality be non SJW. Mothers do stay at home more than fathers, for example.

The whole short was on the nose about overprotective Asian moms. She viewed her son like a fragile Bao and realized eating the son to protect him from leaving the house is incredibly cruel almost akin to killing him which is why she breaks down crying. The complete surprise at him bringing home a non Asian wife is also super on the nose. 

Judging by a lot of folks reactions it seems like cultural differences will prevent a lot of people from fully relating to it and risk not even understanding it. I‚Äôm surprised people didn‚Äôt even realize it was about an empty nest and those things actually did happen to the mom until explained to them.

She makes a dumpling, and the shape reminds her of her baby boy.  She takes the dumpling with her on her errands throughout the day, whimsically imagining a little dumpling boy doing all the things little boys do.  But her memories of her real son's attitude start to color her imagination, and, unable in her mind to undo the ""mistakes"" she made with her own son, she eats the dumpling to stop her runaway imagination/memory fugue.

This breaks her.

The dad calls the son, and when he comes over, forces him to comfort his mother.  They start reconciling.  Many tears were cried.  And then, surprise, the wife she'd refused to get to know turns out to be quite willing to become part of the family.",8r7d6q

I rewatched the first film today, and now it's even more noticeable. Both characters (but especially Helen) sound a lot younger in the first one, and their voices fit the characters better. This isn't meant to be an attack on them though, just something I noticed. People get old after all. Especially after 14 years in between movies. I'm glad they're back though.

At one point I think there was a gay pride parallel... so if there was an evil super, then suddenly the the message of the first film, let talented people use their talent, the message here, (let people be themselves?) gets stained.

In comparison to the first one that didn‚Äôt really care about all that. It‚Äôs a movie about a 40 year old man going through a midlife crisis. It‚Äôs about a family attempting to overcome a world that was trying to forget about them. Very small. Very personal. It wasn‚Äôt trying to solve the unknowable questions of government (that don‚Äôt even apply to reality), it was trying to tell a story about gifted people in the form a James Bond-esque superhero thriller.

It has some interesting ideas but they feel kind of...half-assed to me.

Like I said, the dad stuff was great. I liked that the movie got into the themes of parenting like that. I wish it went all in on it and left behind everything else. Focused it down more.

Brad Bird talked about why he wanted the film to be set immediately after the first. He said something to the degree of if it wasn‚Äôt then it would ‚Äújust be superpowers.‚Äù

That‚Äôs what this movie felt like to me. Just super powers. Kinda like Iron Man 2, The Matrix Reloaded, etc. Prettier to look at, more explosive, interesting ideas, but not as smart.

The characters are reset back to where they were at the end of the first flick and don‚Äôt seem to have learned much more.

Art to me is taking something mundane and making it more visceral. Making it in a way where emotions and circumstances are exaggerated to make them more palpable. The first movie (as stated before) is about a 40 year old man suffering a midlife crisis and coming to appreciate the one thing the world left him: his family. The entire flick is built around this. As far as I could see, there was no core theme to the new one like this. Maybe you guys saw something I didn‚Äôt? I‚Äôm actually curious to know what might have gone over my head.

e8kyf15,"If you're not being tongue in cheek (surely the expression of ""hatred"" alone is enough to disqualify such behaviour), then the answer to your question is as follows: ""you always need somebody to scrub the toilets"".

That's a quote from 'Bioshock', a science fiction videogame that extrapolates what might happen in the long term in a purpose built Randian/Objectivist society. I highly recommend it if you haven't played it.

The meaning of the phrase is that a true civilisation needs people of all classes and abilities to thrive. Yes you need great military thinkers to dream up strategies to defeat attackers but you also need grunts to actually go and do the shooting. Yes you need design geniuses to dream up the next great technology, but you also need consumers, that should probably be saving their money, to go out and buy those things (it wouldn't matter how ""visionary"" Steve Jobs was if there weren't millions of ""normal"" people out there to buy his products). And yes you need great people to build a great society - but you also need people to scrub the toilets.

The ""gifted"" expressing disdain and disrespect and scorn and disgust for ""normal"" people is crass and ignorant. Such behaviour forgets that we are all partners in society and if you turn one group into an underclass you create resentment and this leads to social unrest. There is a saying in biology ""*it is the fate of all species to go extinct*"" and thus far this has proven true of civilisations too. History shows us that every civilisation eventually falls and one of the great causes of the cracks that caused those falls, is social unrest.

To wit; if Brad Bird has such disdain for ""normal"" people (as he appears to), why doesn't he give back all the money he has earned by selling his work to these normal people and only keep the money he received from his fellow ""special"" people? Because he would be broke as shit if he did, that's why.

Brad Bird is not exactly rounding people up for imprisonment, but at 60 years old it is extremely arrogant and juvenile to *still* be making animations that express distaste for the very people that line his pockets.

If he and his like (e.g. one of America's other top dickheads, and fellow Rand fan, Paul Ryan) were really special, they would know that a person's greatness is best measured in how they treat those beneath them in society. Perhaps most stupidly, such goonish, childish behaviour ignores that an awful lot more people could be ""great"" too if they had better chances in life. I wonder how special they would appear if everyone had the same access to education and opportunity? Or do they really think your capacity for greatness is directly linked to how much money your parents have and whom their connections are?",8r7d6q

Pixar doesn‚Äôt want to make the same mistakes as Disney when it comes to sequels (straight to DVD, terrible movie overall) so it‚Äôs only understandable that they really take their time and are serious about making sequels if they do make them, and that not all of the movies get sequels, like up and wall-e, which were both great movies but never got sequels. 
It takes 4 years average just to make a decent animated feature length film, so they really emphasize quality when they wait 4-14 years and spend lots of time writing scripts, designing, and animating so everything is perfect instead of pumping out and producing animated films simultaneously so that they come out two years apart from each other like traditional animated movies. 
Personally, I believe the incredibles got a sequel because everyone demanded it, it would profit, the first movie was amazing and everyone wants to know what happens to the parr family afterwards, and Brad bird decided it was time and he finally got a storyline that he thought would be suitable as a sequel (which is up to debate).

This refusal to accept truth is very much the core of her personality and evidence she hasn't grown and is still villain-like by the end of the film. 

I've really been thinking and I think another way this theme is presented is through Voyd. She clearly doesn't trust *herself*. She doubts her capability and her control of her power and whether she can balance hero work wih real life. But when she is under Screenslaver's control, she's clearly very capable and can actually lead a team. But as she gains back her autonomy, her self-doubt returns and she falters when trying to help Elastigirl.

e15bw6q,"I suppose, having thought about it some more and written some more comments on the topic, that it actually helps her plan for the campaign to get off to a successful start. For a few reasons.

One, it builds public trust in Elastigirl before her later 'attack' on the summit, which reinforces Evelyn's message that trusting in supers is foolish. This way, the public at large is likely to feel betrayed, helping to turn sentiment against the supers and against legalization.

Two, it allows her brother to continue building hype, enabling the summit to occur in the first place in order to maximize visibility and impact of the supers appearing to turn against the public. The optics are super important to her - keep in mind that it's not that she hates the supers personally; she hates that people willingly give up their own agency and rely on them for protection. So she needs as many people as possible to see supers failing and going rogue, in order to convey to them her message that they should trust in themselves and not in supers.",8r7d6q

e14qtiy,"It makes more sense the more you think about it. So we start with supers already being illegal. Then, after the events of the first movie, her brother thinks it's time to help supers become legal again, and she can't convince him otherwise. She knows his plan will work if she doesn't do anything, so she comes up with her plan that will destroy faith in supers for good (by having them kill the ambassadors on the boat). She can only pull off her plan by working along her brother because they're a telecommunications company, so staying with him and the company gives her access to everyone's screens. 

The way she sees it, her parents died not because supers were illegal, but because her dad made the choice to rely on them. He had the choice to go to the safe room or to call the supers, and that's what's important. It doesn't matter if supers were illegal or not because they got gunned down while he was on the phone, so there's no way the supers could have been there in time to save them. It was the decision to call that killed them, so she wants supers to stay illegal so that people can't develop that reliant mentality. ",8r7d6q
e14qp86,"> At the beginning of the film, superheroes were made illegal and her whole logic is to go help his brother make them legal again so that then she can become the villain that wants to make them illegal again. It makes little to no sense

At the beginning of the film, superheroes are already illegal and had been for many years. Her brother is campaigning to make them legal again, and she's working to sabotage his campaign.

Remember that, by her own admission, he's much better at PR and media handling than she is. So she lets him get all the media attention building up to the big summit to draft the legislation, then co-opts that well-publicized, momentous event to make heroes look corrupt and dangerous, which ought to guarantee that no further attempts are made to legalize them in the long term.

I think her goal was not only to bring down her brother's campaign (which she presumably could have trivially done at any time by hypnotizing him or something), but also to make an example of it to discourage any other similar campaigns in the future.

Also keep in mind that she's messed up in the head and not acting rationally - she doesn't just want supers to be illegal; she wants people to fear and distrust them. We see through both movies that people are still willing to place their hope in heroes even while they're illegal; she's trying to portray the heroes as being unworthy of trust in front of a global audience in order to undermine that sentiment.

I think you missed the mark a little bit by claiming that her motive is that she hates superheroes. It's not. She hates peoples' *reliance* on superheroes. She even acknowledges that the reason her father's calls went unanswered was because the heroes couldn't legally respond. She doesn't resent them for not responding, she resents her father's attitude for expecting them to, and it's that attitude she's trying to stamp out in the public. Which is why she needs a public spectacle, in the form of the summit her brother organized, to pull it off.

She's not trying to prevent people from dying per se; she's thinks they need to be taught to look after themselves and not rely on heroes to defend them. She wants to instill a philosophical change in society.",8r7d6q

e14qjae,"Here's what happened. 

The father was delusional. The heroes were banned, but he believed in them so strongly that he wasted time calling them rather than get himself and his wife into the panic room.

The daughter wants to save people by having them never believe in or trust super heroes ever again. She thinks they are better off being resourceful and fending for themselves.

Heroes have been banned for 15 years by the start of the movie. Not right at the beginning of the film. 

Her brother shares his father's belief in super heroes. He is inspired by the Underminer battle and likely the Syndrome robot battle in Incredibles 1. He vows to bring heroes back to legal status. He is rich and owns a major tech company. He will do this with or without his sister. She has to get involved to steer this into a disaster. If she does nothing, heroes will be legal one day.

Instead of waiting for the next Underminer attack or villain inspired by the Underminer, she creates her own villain. She will quickly build up the public's and her brother's belief and trust in heroes so she can bring it crashing down when the hypnotized heroes turn evil in a very public way.

So in short: if she does nothing, her brother will bring back heroes, just at a later date.

She's not saying ""no one should call a hero on the phone; everyone should use a panic room."" She's saying people should use what resources are available to them to secure their safety instead of waiting helplessly for rescue.

The reason the situation with her father troubles her is that he could have saved himself by his own devices, but because he turned to supers instead, he was killed. What specifically his devices were is not particularly important. It could have just as easily been a villain disintegrator ray or an escape rocket or body armour or anything else besides a panic room, even just plain running away, and the point would be the same.

I think if they wanted the whole question superheroes plot they could've changed it up a bit like one of them was framed for a crime  and has to proof their innocence or maybe take a cue from Marvel and question how much should they be depended on which the movie was already making a point of.

But unless there was something that clearly said they weren‚Äôt illegal doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not true and doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a cheat to revisit. *Because it was never resolved in the canon of the movie.* As for the ‚Äúoh they have a limo!‚Äù That doesn‚Äôt mean anything either. The second movie establishes that some politicians are sympathetic to supers - see the ambassador character. Also, it‚Äôs not like only the government has access to limousines. Nor would it be surprising for people to be grateful but not the law to be changed overnight. The fact that it picks up right when the first movie ends also helps make it believable that the law hasn‚Äôt changed but people are more sympathetic to them. If the movie took place five years later, sure, I‚Äôd be with you on the ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt this been resolved yet?‚Äù

Also, they took the limo home from the action scene. Are you suggesting that they managed to overturn a federal law in the time it took to get the limo to the action scene?

You can say it was implied but that‚Äôs your take away. The only official take away from that scene is the family is closer, Dash is able to participate in sports and Violet is more confident. You saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs implied that supers are legal again‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make it so and doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a cheat that the second movie picks off where the first left off. Honestly, that seems like a stretch you‚Äôre trying to use to dislike this movie. 

It‚Äôs not the same plot device - it‚Äôs carrying a storyline thread. Do you say the same thing about the Two Towers and Empire Strikes Back? Those are two movies that carry on the thread of the first one.

As to your second point, the benefactor is *not* the villain in the second one. It‚Äôs stated in the characters‚Äô introduction that the brother owns and runs the company and it‚Äôs his idea to help the supers and he‚Äôs providing the funding. As Evelyn clearly says, she‚Äôs just the tech. At no point does she say she wants to help the supers - in fact, she makes it clear over and over this is her brother‚Äôs project and what he wants. There‚Äôs not even evidence that he knows Evelyn is behind the accidents because those are caused by the Screenslaver and he didn‚Äôt know she was the Screenslaver. ",8r7d6q

It did for like the first half of the film. but once he gets captured the film focuses much more on the family as a whole.

e0tzx3s,"> Its justified plenty this may come as a shock but there's nothing wrong with having a female lead

You're going for a Strawman here. I don't have any problem with female protagonists. Annihilation is one of my favorite movies of this year, and that pretty much as an all female cast. Additionally I have liked many of the recent disney films with female protagonists like Inside Out, Moana, and Frozen. 

My issue with Incredibles 2 is that by focusing on Elstagirl so much all the other characters get zero real development. All their scenes are just sitcome bullshit you'd see on something like Full House. Compare that to the original film and the themes and issues they brought up in that film. It's boring and schlocky. Brad Bird is better than that. Beyond that even when they do get into action the rest of the team doesn't really do anything that interesting. Mr. Incredible is just instantly brainwashed, he has a little big of a fight and a boring scene of him turning the rudder, but it wasn't compelling. I thought maybe that him bonding with the kids more might play into the team actually working better together, but it didn't. There was a real missed opportunity for *most* of the characters, and to me that makes it a pretty terrible film. 

I'll even say this, other than the action, I don't think that even Elstagirl's story was all that interesting. It was very predictable, she didn't really grow as a character very much IMO. Overall the entire story just did nothing to expand on what the original set up. 

This movie was like if you made a Fantastic Four movie and then for the sequel just made it about Mr. Fantastic. That's not a fantastic four film, that's not what it's about. The Incredibles wasn't really focused on the asinine day to day shit that Elstagirl was dealing with. It has a fun compelling story with great action and everyone got the spotlight in certain scenes. IMO Dash didn't have any kind of memorable scene. Characters like Void had more interesting fights than Violet even. This one was just boring to me and a waste of a film. If they ever make another Incredibles film then it will have them all being a legal team. To me that was kind of the assumption of what the sequel would be. Honestly this movie feels like the comicbook tie in that you would get to fill in a few gaps between the films. ",8r7d6q

LA Times: ""There‚Äôs no way you could have anticipated where the zeitgeist would be when you were working on the movie, but the story‚Äôs female-empowerment aspect feels very timely. How do you think that‚Äôll resonate with audiences?""

And, even though the older daughter got the old ways, learning the other methods helped her later in another section where the alternate methods made more sense.

They aren't replacing the old methods, they are just teaching more than one way of doing it.

Syndrome's villain reveal was fast, hard-hitting, and it came out of nowhere while at the same time made complete sense in hindsight because of its early setup.

Whereas with Evelyn, we had the first two-thirds of the movie establishing her motivations and beliefs, and by the time she had her reveal, it makes perfect sense and doesn't have the shock of Syndrome's twist.

e1icmcv,"Another obvious thing I thought of: Helen and Bob lose the fight against the Underminer (and the public) because they refused to trust their family. Instead of letting Violet and Dash help, Helen tried to push them to the sideline and ended up losing because of it. I just watched the first film last night, and this was actually a really clever continuation of Helen's arc from that film. Although the family does end up working together to defeat the robot in the end, Helen spends the entire fight trying to shove her kids to the side. They help in spite of her, not because of her. In the middle of the second film, she works by herself...and sort of succeeds. But it's not until she can no longer trust herself because of the mind control (a pretty brilliant metaphorical plot point, now that I'm thinking about it) that she steps up and places her trust in her family's abilities, and finally succeeds. A pretty obvious lesson learned, in retrospect. I love your ""refusal to accept truth"" thing. A great way to show how villains are incapable of growth. 

Your point about Voyd is fantastic! Adding on to that, I think Voyd and Violet are similar in a lot of ways. Both don't really trust in themselves as capable heroes, and it's not until Helen is endangered that they learn to have faith in their abilities; I see Voyd almost as an older Violet, actually. And everyone's stories of trust are very much intertwined--Violet grows by trusting herself as a leader and a super (I think her problems weren't stemming from boy issues, but rather a deeper ""I don't think I can do this, so I'm not even going to try"" sort of thing, which she must overcome to save her parents). She also learns to put faith in her dad to do his job as her father, just as Bob has to put faith in his children. 

I think you're spot on with Voyd's innate abilities to lead a team when she has to, which is exactly what Violet proves as well. I really wish we could have gotten more of the two interacting, because I think they're fascinating reflections of each other.

PS: I think the film is working to justify its own system of supers in the face of Screenslaver's points. And it finds an answer to justify itself: being proactive about saving yourself is better than being reactive (i.e., the town wanting to just let the Underminer cause mayhem and clean up after him, or Screenslaver's father not lifting a finger to save himself). Supers aren't the problem; being passive, especially about where you place your trust, is. **You can't trust in nothing.** Again: ""At least I have core beliefs."" ",8r7d6q

The brother not knowing is the least of the problems with the villain. Especially when her entire motivation was the flip side of his logic there is so much we have to assume about her motivations. It doesn't help that screenslaver was a red herring from the start and they had to rush the motivations in what time they had left.

But apparently the screenslavers spoken motivation of people being too reliant on tv was a real belief that she had, that we a.) never knew anything about (maybe like you said she was hiding it from her brother), and b.) is never expanded upon outside of screenslaver's broadcast.

I think we can assume that her hatred of television screens is an extension of her main motivation which is that her parents relied on technology and other people instead of their own power or will or something. But then her master plan is dependent on her own technology (which fails) and enslaving other people's power.

Is this supposed to speak to the larger theme of the movie somehow? The downfall of relying too much on individualism when we should be learning to flex our roles in a group dynamic?

That's all well and good but I just had to pull all that out and draw conclusions from a lot of ambiguity. All this in a kid's movie that's a sequel to a movie that summed up it's villain's motivation in a snappy line of dialogue. ""If everyone is special, than no one is.""

Sorry to throw a book at you, but I needed to draw out the problem I had with the pacing in the movie. I feel like they could have just elaborated on any of this and been fine, or just made the brother part of the evil plot and focused on how rigid they are in their dynamic vs the incredible family and tightened everything up.

I loved the movie. I understand its feminist themes. I also think its real message was about understanding that you can rely on people without being totally dependent on them.

e0qnipg,"I understand all of that, but for me, the first one is about personal growth while the second one is about sociopolitical growth. The conflict with Syndrome arises from a personal grudge, Bob gets involved in an attempt to satisfy his own personal needs, and while they do defeat the bad guy, the main thing that accomplish is self actualization and coming together as a family. The civilians in the final battle do acknowledge the supers coming back, but they never talk about making it legal again.

All of the conflicts in the second one have political motives. Yes, Evelyn's grudge is also personal but unlike Syndrome she has no interest in taking the glory for herself, all she cares about is achieving a political endgame. And while Bob's journey in the first one is basically a midlife crisis, Helen is likewise more trying to promote an ideology and achieve a common goal than anything else. 

The two movies are threaded from the same cloth, but when one is an extention of the other's story and they both feature the same characters, I think that's to be expected. I'm mainly just saying that since this is a discussion about this movie, I don't think that there should be so much talk about ""didn't live up to the first"" or ""good but not as good as the first"" when after fourteen years of expectations, anything short of exactly what you expected is gonna feel disappointing.

e0ukrtg,"Lol, you crack me up. So let me get this straight. At the end of first movie, the supers are celebrated and congratulated when they take down the bad guy. The get to back to their real house in an actual limo, like they are celebrities. By the beginning of the next movie, which we are led to believe takes place not more than a couple of weeks (at most) after the first movie, we have the same superhero family save the public from a villain in full glare of the public, but this time, they are arrested and publicly shamed and they can't go back to their house but they are instead taken to a motel in the cover of darkness. I'm sorry, but something just doesn't add up. You don't treat people in two completely different ways for doing the exact same thing. Let's agree to disagree there.

>As to your second point, the benefactor is not the villain in the second one. 

This is a weak rebuttal. Of course, I know he is not the villain. But she is his sister. She works with him. There is hardly a scene in the movie they are not together. The movie makes us believes she is at the very least his partner. She could probably even make decisions on his behalf. The point here is not whether or not it was the exact same person who turned out to be the villain. They represented the same company with the same interests. As far as I am concerned, the villain could have been either of them or even both, and it wouldn't change a thing.

EDIT: So I went over the end of the first movie again. When Mr. Incredible asks the lawyer if this means they can come out in the open. The lawyer says, ""oh, let the politicians figure that out, but I have been asked to assure you that we will take care of everything else"". At another point, he also says, the people of this city owe you a great debt. 

So I guess you are right in that this is not completely resolved by the end of the movie. But I still stand by my earlier premise that it was heavily implied that they were no longer going to be treated as illegal. If they decide to still go with the ""supers-illegal"" narrative, I think they should have at least cushioned it with some kind of counter-narrative. But that's just my opinion.

Second point: I could complain for days about this being another superhero film. Those new superhero characters they introduced were the lamest part of the whole film. Uninteresting blobs, essentially. Voyd is the only one that gets close to having some sort of character development, but they never attempt to integrate her into the family plot and she ends up making a bunch of convenient teleport holes instead. What a waste. Also they build up Jack Jack's powers with almost no payoff at all -- he just makes his dad sleepy.

We also wouldn't have seen the story on how Supers were made legal again, instead jumping into some future point where there are a ton of Supers around again and they're legally allowed to be heroes but we wouldn't know how or why.

I do still want a time-skip to happen. But there's potential here for another movie, maybe even multiple movies turning this into a full franchise. So long as they maintain the proper quality like they're doing with Toy Story, I see no reason why this couldn't go beyond just 2 or 3 movies. 

So if we're going to have a time-skip, it makes more sense to do it later, maybe after the 3rd movie.

Doesn't really make sense, because they directly saved people from being killed in the first scene. They would have died jf not for the heroes. Those people would speak good about them. It feels forced to say that people don't like them, even though all they did was stop other villains from making things worse. The heroes never cause any property damage just because, hey I want to",8r7d6q
e0zf9a2,"You know what I was thinking. The Incredibles did nothing different in their actions when saving people. There were always Eye-witness accounts, seeing them being heroic and making things better.

The body cams concept doesn't really make sense. Internet doesn't exist, so how is the footage broadcast, and how is it broadcast so quickly? Do they jack TV stations? Either way, it was never the public that needed convincing. The heroes had been doing nothing but saving them. 

The only people who see problems with super heroes are those who were selfish and greedy. People in government, people looking for a lawsuit, people looking for anyway to exploit the system to get something out of it. That's why during the interrogation scene, the two jackasses were all up in arms about their insurance, where they would have been covered if not for The Incredibles. The Super Regulation isn't about the public opinion, it's about the people in power.

Now this could have had a completely different type of villain. No costume or cheesy name. A story about not one person, but a group of people. Stubborn politicians, other people who are rich and have influence, enforcing laws that benefit them at the expense of innocence. 

Crime would have gone up. Why would super-villains go away. People like Bomb Voyage wouldn't just start caring about the law.

In the Dark Knight franchise, the theme of Batman as an idea that can inspire others to be better is explored and comes to its natural conclusion in TDKR with the city commemorating Batman as a hero, implying that more people are following his lead.

In the Incredibles 2, the ending implies that the supers still aren't taking any kind of responsibility for being so complicit in the dangers present in their world. ",8r7d6q

e0u0dwh,"> Like, one of their worst movies? Have you seen Finding Dory, Cars 2, Cars 3, Monsters University, and Good Dinosaur?

None of those other films actually made me angry. This film made me angry because I was so goddamn bored for most of it, and I felt like it was just going through trope after trope after trope. It felt so poorly crafted and drawn out. As i said before this isn't an Incredibles movie this is an Elstagirl movie with the rest of the characters doing pointless sitcom bullshit. And I'm not against female protagonists, I just think that an Incredibles film should have the family doing more stuff. It's kind of like The Last Jedi. it splits up the characters and just gives the main plot to one character and the rest are left to do bullshit that amounts to nothing. I hope that this doesn't become some kind of writing trend, but it is troubling seeing it in two films like this. I honestly feel like a lot of the good reviews are because it focused on Elstagirl and they think it's somehow progressive to say that men can't be competent parents. But what's a better message for this film to send ""women can be great superheroes by themselves and men suck at being parents"" or ""a family can come together and work equally to solve a problem"". To me the later is. I feel like in all this effort to portray women equally, it has just devolved into man bashing. Stories where men and women can work together as equals IMO is a much better message to send. Showing men as just being incompetent is just setting up kids of today for myriad of complexes. ",8r7d6q

e1oa2ud,">Pretty much everyone age 18 to 60 has a few drinks at a party.

Three drinks is defined as heavy drinking, normal or not (which actually it's not), it's irresponible to normalize that behavior particularly in a kids film. It's literally a stupid pointless mundane thing to exploit. If you saw Elastigirl eating three Snicker bars in a row for no other reason than that she was being offered them would you think that was reasonable for her character?

And before you say something boring like ""you must be fun at parties"" - I'm not! Way hell of a lot more to life than parties. I try to avoid them at all costs.

BTW, the average consumption for women who actually drink (btw, not everyone does) is 1 drink at 52&#37; of women. Now tell me, do you honestly think Helen, who is represented as outstandingly responsible is the type to be in the minority and actually drink excessively. She's not. It's a lazy script and this is only one reason why. Like I said, I wouldn't have had a problem with it if it actually served the plot in some way but it was a boring lazy Dreamworks move.",8r7d6q
e0t1o88,"Me too. I liked Rey in the first movie and actually defended her against people calling her a Mary Sue. But in TLJ she is pretty firmly established as a Mary Sue. They also really do nothing with her character. She is pretty much just there to develop Luke. She has no real character development, she is exactly the same at the end as when she started. Nothing Luke tells her about questioning the Jedi and all that affect her *at all*. To me him telling her the Jedi were faulty could have been a cool plot point in developing doubt and having some inner conflict. But she has no inner conflict.

And then there is Rose, who is IMO up there with Jar Jar in how terrible she is. She just has the cringyist lines. Her acting isn't great. Like she feels absolutely like a prequel character inthe worst way possible.

Having said that I do actually like TFA, RO, and Solo. IMO Jyn from RO is actually a more interesting character than Rey. She has an interesting past, she has inner conflict, he has a full arc in the film etc. 

But you are right they are filling everything with female protagonists and to me that will bite them in the ass. It looks like the next game Fallen Order will have a female protagonist as well. I'm actually surprised that Rebels ended up with a male protagonist at this point. I have no doubt that when they do the new live action Star Wars show it will be a mary sue female protagonist with most likely a black woman in the role. That just feels like Lucasfilm's agenda at this point. I honestly feel kind of done with SW if they keep this kind of thing up.

I don't think she's necessarily against superheroes stopping supervillains, though; she's against civilians taking a passive approach to their own protection in the meanwhile.",8r7d6q
e158ecu,"I'm pretty sure hiding and then calling the cops is standard for most people in the event of a break-in. And we can throw out the gun example because that would clearly be him taking it into his own hands, so she at least wouldn't consider guns making him weak. It's only in the specific scenario of this dude being obsessed with supers that he makes the mistakes of (a) not putting the super hotline in his safe room so that he can brag about having supers' numbers and (b) calling that hotline instead of hiding. 

In a non-super scenario, maybe she'd be pro-gun if he died outside the safe room calling the cops (which again, most people wouldn't do) or maybe she'd be anti-gun if he died trying to protect himself with a gun rather than hiding and calling the cops. There's some type of logic present in all these reactions (including the logic she used), but her rationalization is informed by her specific emotional trauma. It ultimately doesn't matter what logic she would've used in other scenarios, it doesn't really undermine the logic of her response to the actual scenario. Imo her logic is reasonable enough that, combined with her trauma, it makes her a well-written villain, at least in terms of motivation (one whose motivation is understandable without justifying her villainy).

To me, that seems like ""fuck women"" waaaaaay more than a movie that talks about how the world is mostly male-centric.

Also, ""read a book"" does not work as a critique of how a film does something, specifically not when we're talking about being concise. Books have the luxury of taking time to delve into things. Movies have to move at a brisk pace and avoid getting bogged down in details to keep from dragging. *Especially* family movies.

Plus, we actually **are** given a reason why he would sooner call those two heroes than call the police. He has a rapport with them; he trusts them personally. Presumably, he counts on them to respond faster than the police, so his hierarchy of recourse probably goes something like Supers > Panic Room > Police.",8r7d6q
e14ihnc,"No, you're missing most of the point. 

I think the writing is fine. Not super great. You think it's really bad. Less than average. 

Now that means they put out a possibly satisifying product. Not, definately, possibly.

So we go deeper. Nothing to do with Bird being smarter. But based on his record and Pixar's. They waited 14 years. And the MAIN POINT: They also have a history of stopping production and starting over if they think it's not working. Tons of people involved, tons of input. They know about being too invested, so they show it around to other Pixar directors and no one is shy about their opinion.

There is not meant to be an ingenious exploration of genre. Just like there wasn't in the first movie. It was finely written. We know what badly written is. Cars 2.

So yea, I‚Äôm not shocked that events that are separated and have two different outcomes (they successfully stop Syndrome, they do not successfully stop the Underminer) would result in two completely different outcomes. Because in one situation they saved the day and in the other they didn‚Äôt.

It is not a weak rebuttal. He‚Äôs the benefactor - she‚Äôs not. She says repeatedly helping the supers is what *he* wants and her and Elastigirl have a conversation about how he runs everything despite her being the one who builds things. 

And yes, him being the villain would have changed things - because then the actual benefactor would be the villain.

Instead, the villain who repeatedly says she wouldn‚Äôt be doing this if not for her brother. Oh yea, that‚Äôs a committed benefactor there. Nothing says I‚Äôm a benefactor more than ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just helping you because someone is making me help you.‚Äù

Yea, the movie makes it seem like they‚Äôre partners - if you ignore the dialogue that states over and over she‚Äôs just doing what her brother says to do. Really, you‚Äôre just reaching extremely hard on that one. 

When it comes down to it, would she be helping if her brother wasn‚Äôt involved? No, she wouldn‚Äôt. ",8r7d6q
e0unajb,"The implication of the first movie is that everything is going to be okay, because that's what the family feels. There's a ton of positive feelings after the first event because (a) they accomplished their goal, which was just to stop the robot and (b) this was a surprise event that caught everyone, including the government off guard. The point of the second movie is that feeling was hollow. It takes a lot to change minds, and most of the public had been convinced over time that they were better off without Supers. The event in the first movie was a big deal, but it didn't magically solve those problems overnight. Also, the people who were happy in the first movie we're almost exclusively the people who directly benefitted, whereas the second movie was more about the political implications of it. The second movie told us that while it was a feel-good moment, it actually made things worse politically, and the Underminer event took things over the edge. 

The event with the Underminer is different because the Underminer clearly announced himself and his intentions before taking any action. But this didn't happen in a vacuum. The robot event *just* happened and the family was far less successful. The Underminer collapsed several buildings, successfully robbed a bank and got away, and caused significant damage to the courthouse (city hall?). Even with all the damage, the family+Frozone were unable to catch the villian or thwart his plans (unlike Syndrome, where they at least thwarted his plans and then privately caught him). The event in the beginning represented the other side of the argument: sure the supers help, but they cause a lot of damage, and often aren't even successful. The fact that lives were saved was missed on the general public because they ultimately failed, and the city was destroyed for a second time in a pretty short time period. 

As for Saul Goodman, it's pretty clear his sister is operating behind his back. As the commenter above said, she's just the inventor, and chooses not to concern herself with the day to day operation of the company. They heavily imply that even though it is one company, the two siblings stay out of each other's business until one needs the other. All of the sister's work as the Screenslaver was unknown to Saul because she was intentionally hiding it. It's made pretty clear she's at least a little smarter than him, and his altruism can blind him to her feelings. It's also pretty clear the disagreement over their parents death is a sore spot between them and simultaneously a driving force behind both their actions. We see them together because they need to work together to convince the supers to work for their company. But I thought it was pretty clear that they don't spend a whole lot of time together.",8r7d6q

e0unbgo,"That again isn't true at all.

In the first one, the parents don't want the kids involved at all. In 2, they still trust the kids(ish), but they want them to watch Jack Jack instead of really getting involved. The kids *want* to help, but they *need* to protect Jack Jack. That's mostly Violet's arc and she accepts that by the end of the movie. Dash, on the other hand, becomes more personally responsible and mature. Earlier in the movie, he plays with every remote he can get his hands on and even steals it from Robert to continue playing with it. Later on, he willingly hands over the remote control to the Incredimobile without any fuss when he needs to.

The parents' arcs have much less to do with trusting the children and more to do with their reversed roles. Helen still wants to take care of her family and Robert wants to be the breadwinner. Robert has to learn to be a more active father and struggles to do so until he accepts that he needs to take care of the kids instead of impatiently waiting for his opportunity to get back to being a super hero. Helen would much rather be with her family, but once she gets wrapped up in the Screenslaver conflict, she accepts the duty of solving it.

Every school district can choose how it wants to get their students to meet the common core standards.

As for the ""more steps"" comment, in many cases that is true.  But, the point is not to just get kids to memorize how to solve problems, but to understand what they are solving.

I know it's hard to write a strong female character who isn't just exactly how you'd write a male character but you give him a vagina, or have them run into the trope of being a damsel in distress. But you can subvert these without deliberately drawing attention to it, or actively making comments that serve to put men down. You could have made Incredibles 2 with all the same plot threads. Elastigirl is the main character, Evelyn is the main villain, Mr Incredible has to deal with being the stay at home parent, all the same story beats - just without the weird jabs at men peppered into the dialogue, especially when they have no overarching purpose of the movie.

I still think the theme is about reliance on others, as I've stated (but maybe not in this exact thread, since I've been kind of all over). You can just look at the flawed ideology of the villain that she wants a world where no one is reliant on Supers. So it's possible the anti-men messages were almost satirical. The snippet I'm mostly talking about (the commercial) really caught me off guard but I'll need to pay more attention to the context it's in on a second viewing. 

Yes, there's a bad trend of super hero films (and all action films, really) being heavily male centric. But none of these films make comments that the women can't do the job. You don't hear Thor cracking jokes that ""it's so easy even she can do it."" Also I don't mind joking about it, or making reference to it, but I just prefer it's tasteful. Though at this point I'm probably looking inconsistent as hell.

Most important point to drive home though is it's not the female leads that make me feel the movie had a ""fuck men"" attitude, or their discussion that super heroes are dominated by men, it was the blatant, clumsy jab with that weird ad that the slapped into the movie. It is, if anything, jarring. ",8r7d6q

They're more exciting, had better directors, had more talented actors and budgets. So you can't say it's better ""just because they're men"" as an excuse for this movie to try and 'flip roles.' 

The effort the directors in this movie took to push a 'men aren't as good', 'women are better' agenda was so blatant with the commercials in the background of the movie and the comments being made. And in a kids movie? Seriously trash.

I'm operating on the basic, writing 101 assumption that the world there works like the world here. It is irrelevant whether the superhero phone is there or not. It is **an option**. This is a basic tenet of writing that if your fiction takes place in a world mostly like our own, you have to explain why people behave differently from the way people would here. Everything you're saying is ridiculously fanboyish. A single line explaining why the police were not considered does not destroy conciseness when there are long stretches in the film that are of no consequence to the plot. Again, my objection has **ZERO** to do with whether contacting superheroes is a better option. It's that they don't even address it.

This makes absolutely no sense. They did stop the underminer. They stopped his plans. He just managed to escape. If you are trying to argue that they failed because he escaped, remember that syndrome also technically escaped after they destroyed his robot. If he wasn't such an evil greedy bastard, he could have gotten away completely clean. The distinction you are trying to make is pointless. They saved the day in both cases.

Your second point suggests to me you really don't want to see another POV. Evelyn is not her brother's slave. She doesn't just do what he tells her to. That's silly. IIRC, her conversation with elastigirl was more so about her she really isn't into selling stuff, and how her brother is the salesman, she's just into the tech. The idea may not have been hers, but she supported it. She made tech for elastigirl and the other supers. She keeps trying to guide and support elastigirl along the way.

Imagine if Steve Wozniak comes out tomorrow and says he never really wanted to create Apple with jobs. Jobs always told him what to do, and all he cared about was the tech.

It's been said before, but I blame Hanna-Barbara. They really set animation back with their television work during the 60s, and their output lead to 30 years of horribly-written, badly animated, overly sanitized crap that led to the idea of cartoons only being for kids in the public conscious. They did irrevocable damage to the industry if you ask me, and most people look back fondly on them mainly due to nostalgia. 

It's a shame, because during that same time (the 60s, 70s, and 80s), Japan had stuff like Lupin III, Ashita No Joe, Gundam, the works of Leiji Matsumoto and Osamu Tezuka, Urusei Yatsura, and what did we have? Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, Speed Buggy, Jabber Jaw and all those other Scooby Doo rip-offs, celebrity toons like the Jackson 5 show, the Beatles show, and the Chuck Norris show and merchandise-driven crap like He-Man and the original Transformers.

e19ddxe,"I am a total feminist and I agree with this statement in principle but for a different reason.

My issue with the movie isn't that it's feminist: it's that it's anti-men. It makes men into these cartoonish stereotypes and that's just... lazy writing.

For instance: the commercial. Yes, we're in the 1950's, but my god, what a way to put men down in a movie that is so female forward by automatically making the commercials sexist. On top of that, let's look at Bob: he's whiny and petulant about not being  the figurehead of the Supers and for all of his strength, still doesn't seem to really enjoy his kids. It's a chore to him- it exhausts him. He would rather work in insurance or find another job than to stay at home with the kids. When Helen offers to work, he shuts her down, in part because of cultural stigma but also because of his insecurity and vulnerability- which she empathizes with but he doesn't seem to get. He still struggles with it.

Here's the thing: in order for men and women to be on equal footing, we have to actually be able to portray men as decent people while we raise women up. We have to provide heroes for our kids where the men aren't behaving as boys when it comes to giving the girls a chance. We have to have men that actually love being fathers- that happily choose being SAHD or at least be self aware of the fact that they don't always have to be the strong one. And for all of the talk of adding vaginas to men/incels/etc: THAT TALK IS WHY BOB IS SO EASILY DEMEANED. When we have men putting down other men for being the support women need or we talk about masculinity as the antithesis of femininity, we remain stuck in a world that really doesn't want to move forward in equality, but wants to divide us even more. When we condemn a movie for being feminist, but ignore how the movie could be better for both sexes, we divide the sexes even more.  


What I would have loved to see happen in this movie is if Bob actually seemed HAPPY that Helen was working. If he seemed HAPPY to hang out with the kids. If he seemed HAPPY to be the primary caregiver. It wasn't there. He was only truly happy when he was the hero and that's really more binary thinking. On top of that, it lowered him in my opinion while it could have really made him exemplary. It was so lazy-- as if all of the effort was made into making Helen the hero and Bob a punchline. We don't have to bring men down to raise women up. We should raise both up.",8r7d6q
eaezvhb,"> First of all, those movies at up top because they're objectively better.

Nobody said otherwise.  This is a terrible point, and a horrible way to start your comment off.

> They're more exciting, had better directors, had more talented actors and budgets. So you can't say it's better ""just because they're men"" as an excuse for this movie to try and 'flip roles.'

I didn't say that they're better because they're men.  I'm saying that bigger movies with more money and studio backing have historically given their lead roles to men.  I was highlighting that.  I honestly can't believe you took it another way haha.

> The effort the directors in this movie took to push a 'men aren't as good', 'women are better' agenda was so blatant with the commercials in the background of the movie and the comments being made. And in a kids movie? Seriously trash.



Honestly, this was 5 months ago, and the movie itself was kinda forgettable.  I love that I get a reminder 5 months later that weak people got offended by it.  Which is  hilarious.

This is a stupid tactic and you should stop using it.",8r7d6q
e15arbq,"> This is a basic tenet of writing that if your fiction takes place in a world mostly like our own, you have to explain why people behave differently from the way people would here.

You're right. It sure would've made the movie better if it spent 5 minutes of exposition before explaining the character's death to carefully describe how he came to know and trust the supers, so we would know exactly why he would go to them as his first recourse in the event of danger.

Oh wait, it *did* do that!

I'm not being ""fanboyish"" by asserting that they're not obligated to explain an arbitrary course of action the characters *don't* take... you're being an obsessive curmudgeon by fixating on this one particular thing as if the film is obligated to explain why he didn't do that one specific thing.

Nothing about ""basic writing"" says ""whereupon a character is faced with a dangerous situation, it must absolutely be explained why that character chooses any other option than calling the police"".

No matter how much in your heart of hearts you really really want it to be. For some inscrutable arbitrary reason.

While we're at it, let's also explain why he didn't reach for a hidden firearm. Or why he didn't fend off his attackers with pepper spray. Or why he didn't lay down on the floor and await the sweet release of death. But that probably has something to do with it being more important to explain why he did what he did, rather than why he didn't do what he didn't do.

""Writing 101"" is to not burden the reader/viewer with excessive information. We're told why he did use the phones. We're told why he didn't use the panic room. Those are the only two options that are directly relevant to the plot. Telling us why he didn't call the police would have contributed no value to the narrative.

And before you repeat that it's necessary to explain why a character in a setting would behave differently than a character in the real world - I'm not saying you're wrong about that. But in the case of this film, there's no need to come out and say explicitly why the character wouldn't have called the police. Because the presence of superheroes and the climate of reliance upon them is already very well established by the time that scene happens. Implicit explanations still count as explanations, and we can safely assume that calling the police would've been somewhere on the character's radar of priorities for the situation he was in. But he never got to that point.

As for the panic room itself, we have to keep in mind that this information was presented through the biased perspective of a character who saw in that room a solution that aligned with the philosophy she was endorsing. It's a real ""when you have a hammer every problem looks like a nail"" sort of situation with that.",8r7d6q

I never said Evelyn was his slave. I said Evelyn wasn‚Äôt a benefactor from a financial and want perspective. She was *an employee.* She states in her first scene that her brother owns and runs the company. Again, she wouldn‚Äôt be doing this if it wasn‚Äôt her brother‚Äôs idea. She constantly says that. You‚Äôre basically forcing a want on a character that is pretty established she doesn‚Äôt have. 

Yes, everyone knows Jobs and Wozniak were partners. *Because they were partners and made that clear.* But when you have Evelyn saying this is her brother‚Äôs company, her brother is the boss, her brother wants to help the supers, and she just makes the technology, well guess what? That probably means it‚Äôs her brother‚Äôs company, her brother is the boss, her brother wants to help the supers and she just designs the technology. I know this may be a shock to you but it is common for siblings to be employees of another. That doesn‚Äôt make the slaves. That makes them employees.

The text of the movie makes it very clear that she wouldn‚Äôt be doing this if it wasn‚Äôt for her brother. You‚Äôre trying to shove something in that‚Äôs not there. 

For someone to be a benefactor, there actually has to be a want to be there. At best, you can argue Evelyn takes advantage of the situation but that doesn‚Äôt make her a benefactor either.

e14kmcg,"That interview clip is from the very beginning of the first film and is supposed to help characterize Elastigirl as a competent hero and a leading female super of her time. That's it. She wasn't antagonizing male supers, she was encouraging female supers to also step up (it was the '40's). It makes an appearance in this sequel as a callback to the first, but beyond that the context is it playing on a screen at an event celebrating her return to crimefighting iirc, maybe to make her nostalgic to encourage her return.

The exhaustion was mostly due to Jack-Jack, which given his varied power set and escape artist personality is understandable. Bob makes a genuine effort to help Dash with his maths homework and fix things up with Violet, and even tells her point blank he wants to be a good dad. The problem is he doesn't know what to do or has the energy to keep up, hence sleeping for seventeen hours as soon as Jack-Jack is gone.",8r7d6q

I really want to see it again to see if those parts are there.

I even like Black Panther a good bit (it's not in my top 5 marvel films or anything but I thought it was a solid story honestly). I hope that they can do something interesting with Captain Marvel. Honestly the only interesting thing about Captain Marvel was that Rogue stole her powers.
