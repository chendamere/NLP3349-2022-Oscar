dswkprm,"After thinking on it, I believe that what Reynolds Woodcock truly wanted was a mother.  Alma became a contender for that role by feeding him, referring to him as her 'hungry boy'.  He criticized her appearance but said that he'd make her beautiful, or in other words shape her into the woman he wanted by putting her to the test by being a stubborn boy with behavior like his picky eating (refusing to enjoy vegetables the way she prepares them) and complaining.

When he became sick, his mother appeared as a ghost that he longed for and reached out to, but who didn't respond.  Then Alma enters and it's when she starts tending to him and caring for him that the ghostly figure disappears.

In the end, he got what he truly wanted, a woman who literally made him eat his vegetables (yeah, yeah I know, actually mushrooms) and care for him like the mother he longed for.

Plus there's a whole other side to what Alma wanted.  What a movie!",7rfe1t
dswjgl8,"I remember during production there were rumors that this film was PTA's take on Fifty Shades, and those rumors definitely fueled my take. The pleasure derived from being in control. It's incredible how sensual, intimate, and even erotic, this film is without ever being explicit. Then at the same time, there is so much abuse that Alma withstands. She even takes pride in it when she discusses her ability to stand all day for him. Despite his incessant need for control and dominance, Reynold's true joy begins with his submission. Love that twist.
Best part of PTA is that there is always so much to dissect. I'm looking forward to seeing the movie again and hearing other people's takes on it.",7rfe1t

dswktpx,"One key, I think, to understanding this film better is in the names. His name is ""Woodcock"" which is self-explanatory. Her name is Alma, which in Latin means ""nourishing"". Hence the Latin name for ones school is ""Alma Mater"" or ""Nourishing Mother"". Woodcock needs nourishment. He literally says he is ""hungry"" throughout. She calls him a ""hungry boy"", and their first meeting is when she is serving him a meal, literally ""nourishing"" him. But he wants the nourishment his way. The power play is over how she will nourish him. She wants to be his nourishment. She doesn't want his ghost mother to be the nourishment. Nor does she want the sister to be the nourishment. She must become his nourishment. I think the film plays with gender roles also. Woodcock represents the masculine role and the need for nourishment in various forms and the power of the feminine over the masculine. The sister, Alma, and the other women in the film represent the feminine the ""Alma"" or nourishment they provide symbolically. 

Anyway. I just saw the movie and have a lot to think on after leaving it. I absolutely loved it, and I think it is the best movie made in 2017. 
",7rfe1t
dsz1d80,"""If you want to have a staring contest with me, you will lose.""

I think this encounter does a good job of summing up their romance; she is going to challenge Woodcock, and he looks away uncomfortably during the staring contest.

PTA knocked it out of the park with this one visually; best framing and shot composition since Kubrick, in my opinion (the layering of the buildings in the background in the gas station scene was fantastic). And good movement as well, I love the 360 degree shot as a bunch of the ladies of House Woodcock stand around a table.

If anyone knows any specifics on how PTA came to take on such a big role with the camera work, could they let me know? For instance, did he have anyone attached as D. of Photography and that just fell through or something?",7rfe1t
dszs3sp,"I can’t believe no one has mentioned it yet, but that scene where he hallucinates his mother freaked me the *fuck* out.

dsy1z8l,"Just saw the movie and I was very impressed. I still can't get the score out of my head.

Obviously the film is about the relationship between Woodcock and Alma, but I also thought it worked well as an allegory for the cycle of creativity. At the beginning of the story, Alma becomes Woodcock's muse and inspiration. He even mentioned to her that he's been waiting for her for a very long time. He's been waiting for somebody to come along and ignite his passion. She makes him hungry for it.

Then eventually things become stale and his creative drive begins to dissipate. He becomes extremely frustrated/ disinterested with Alma. A lot of creative types find it difficult to produce at times in their lives when they are complacent. He was always trying to fill a hole with his work and once that hole had been filled by somebody else, his work began to suffer for it.

In his past relationships he would simply end things so that he could be alone again and keep filling that hole with his craft. Then he finds a new muse and the cycle repeats.

When Alma decides to poison him, she allows him to purge that complacency. He is facing death and uncertainty and that hole that was filled is emptied. And Alma is there after the reset button has been pressed. He is hungry again. Rinse, lather, repeat.

These are just thoughts that were running through my head on my drive home and I could be completely off base. Either way, fantastic movie. PTA gone and done it again",7rfe1t
dswmsas,"I absolutely loved it. Far and away my favorite film from 2017.

What stuck with me the most is that one shot of Alma lying on the couch, with the finished wedding dress standing next to her, and a recovered Reynolds enters the room to sit next to her. The camera slowly pans/zooms to focus on just the two of them, with the dress being slowly removed from the frame, signifying that she has become the object of his affection. Simply a tremendously subtle way to visually express his emotions and mind.

Also, that Jonny Greenwood score is intoxicating. I bought the soundtrack as soon as it was available.",7rfe1t
dswr5yt,"Dave Chen summed up my thoughts on the film pretty well: ""[THE PHANTOM THREAD was exceptionally well made and well acted. But it depressed and disturbed me.

dszczp7,"I'm conflicted. I loved the score, loved the performances of the three main actors/actresses, and enjoyed parts of the cinematography but something fell a little flat for me with the story that I can't quite put my finger on.

dswifmh,"I know it's almost needless to say it, but Daniel Day Lewis is absolutely amazing in this film, and should be in serious consideration for Best Actor. His haunting performance is rivaled only by Krieps' outstanding delivery. She definitely should be nominated for Best Actress, but I don't know if I necessarily think she should win over McDormand, Streep, Ronan, and Hawkins.",7rfe1t
dswhyzr,"Paul Thomas Anderson is in the business of making all-time worthy movies. I saw this for the second time yesterday and I loved it even more. Picked up on the themes and motifs in the first half a little better (i.e. just how much of the film revolves around food even moreso than clothes). Jonny Greenwood topped his There Will Be Blood score with The Master and I think he's topped it again. Remove the score and the film's atmosphere falls apart. Splendidly shot and acted either way. This is an instant classic.

edit: I have a very very very small question I really wish I thought I asked PTA during his AMA on reddit and twitter the past couple of days. There's a New Years scene and I was just wondering.. what year is it? I know it's the 50s but if anyone knows more than me let me know. It's not important, but I can't help but be curious.",7rfe1t

dt459oo,"The whole movie felt... strange. In movies usually there's some kind of driving force that advances the narrative, but I never got that feeling in Phantom Thread.

dswi3xi,"I will never forget the way my audience gasped when he says “Take me to bed before I become sick.”

This is one of the best romantic comedies ever made. PTA said he was making his *Rebecca*, and he wasn’t kidding, but he also made a really funny movie. This is the kind of film you can only get from a major filmmaker at the top of his game. For me, it’s the best film of 2017 and it isn’t even close. ",7rfe1t
dsxe3ue,"I really need to have an in depth discussion with someone who found this more than good because this film really fell flat for me in an all style/very little substance kind of way.  

Yes, the cinematography is breathtaking (saw it in 70mm) and the score is one of the best I've heard in quite some time (with Catch Hold and House of Woodcock being exquisite standouts), that being said, the whole foundation of the film is built upon a relationship I never really believed in at any point which makes the film feel practically soulless, with the only real charm coming from the score and performances.  

The main rule of film-making is show, don't tell, and I still can't think of any instance in this film where we're shown that the two actually love each other. You can see the cracks in the foundation from nearly the day after their first date night (e.g. ""STOP""), and before he's poisoned we get a less than 2 minute scene showing how ""tender"" he can be (via Alma's narration). That side of him really only comes out because he's so exhausted from completing his work that he barely has the mental fortitude to do or be anything more than an infant (which speaks to the themes of motherly nourishment throughout, I get it, but why? Because he's too engrossed in his work? ok, why? Because he yearns for a motherly figure in his life, ok, why?). If i'm remembering correctly, the only vague insight we gain into his attraction for her is her ""ideal form""...ok.  

She, on the other hand, well, I can't even venture a guess as to why she's attracted to him besides his prestige. Seriously, do we ever get any glimpse through her lens of desire for him? Then, once she realizes he's never going to tell her to fuck off, she decides to poison him to force him into her clutches so he can realize how much he really needs her. Which works, for a spell, like any other passion, before the aforementioned old cracks in the foundation start to show, at which point the cycle just repeats itself, for, what reason exactly? You probably get the gist of what i'm getting at by this point.  Though I will say, the slow zoom proposal shot was not only beautiful, but genius.

Also, can we talk about his relationship with Cyril for a second? Why are they so close? I mean, I get that brothers and sisters can be quite intimate, but in the context of this film, I felt like there was a scene left on the cutting room floor that told us a little more about the nature of said intimacy. A little allusion to them surviving the blitz or something to that affect would've gone a long way.  

Another thing I want to add is that I felt a little bit like an alien in my screening as I didn't feel this to be as much of a comedy as people are making it out to be. My audience (a nearly packed music box theatre if anyone is familiar) was practically uproarious, which I found odd as I was on edge nearly the entire time once the two met as I kept waiting for the other metaphorical foot to drop. In that respect I felt PTA did a wonderful job of encapsulating what Alma felt while living with Woodcock, which added more to the film than any comedy. Don't get me wrong, I thought it had it's fleeting moments of humor, but I would hardly call the film funny.  
All that being said, I found the film to be exemplary on a technical and sonic level, but the characters, and motivation came across as borderline elementary.  

A few final notes: I could watch the scenes of DDL driving on repeat for eternity. They were immaculately shot, and captured the feeling of driving/acceleration really well, which is something I usually find lacking in cinema.  
Lastly, did he know she was poisoning him in the end or was it just a little bit of ironic dialogue? I'm currently rolling with the latter, but will revisit that upon subsequent viewings. I just wish it ended right after he said ""kiss me before I become sick"". ",7rfe1t

dswib75,"Saw it for the second time today, and I think I like it even more than the first time I watched it, having caught all the little details.

Man, Vicky Krieps goes totally toe-to-toe with DDL, and I’d say in several scenes she even steals the show. I know this movie came out late, but I hope she gets some recognition at some of the later awards.

It’s surprisingly hilarious and full of that dry British humor. Definitely just the right amount of fucked up for me.",7rfe1t

dtbae2l,"/u/cebjmb asked why the doctor called Alma Mrs. Woodcock, and my reply became so long that I'm posting it as a comment instead. Anyway, a few thoughts on the doctor and just how much he represents, because he's one of those characters who seemed completely utilitarian at first glance and then turned out to be a lot more.

""Mrs. Woodcock"" says a ton about both the characters and the situation that they're in. Living together in the 1950s was really, really out of bounds -- people did it, but they had to be ready to brace for a LOT of blowback. It doesn't matter for Reynolds so much because he and Cyril have their own little fiefdom and no surviving family to disapprove; plus, even if their customers knew, they would probably be more flexible about it than they usually would be partly because hey, artists have a right to be a little unconventional, and also because if they want a Woodcock dress, they don't exactly have other options. Alma is more of a mystery, but she clearly has no family nearby and may have no family at all -- we hear about her mother but never see her, it's not even clear if she's alive. However, if her friends and old employers know that she's living with a man without being married, it's unlikely that they approve and it's likely that a few friends at least have dropped her. She's in a very vulnerable position. 

The doctor is the first character to come in who isn't living entirely in the walled garden which Reynolds and Cyril have built for themselves; he's not a girlfriend, an employee, or a client. He's in their house, but he really belongs to the outside, conventional world -- he's not subject to the rules of their house. He doesn't have to defer to Woodcock sensibilities in the hope of getting something out of them, whether it be a dress, a job, or love. When Reynolds tells him to fuck off, and he does, Reynolds really has no power over him; the doctor is fucking off purely out of politeness and consideration for the patient (and he still insists upon being called later if things change). 

The doctor almost certainly knows that Reynolds and Alma are not in fact married; for one thing, he's a client's nephew and moves in some of the same circles -- he undoubtedly knows something of Reynolds' reputation. For another, Alma has no wedding ring. Not everyone wears wedding rings, but combine that with Reynolds's rep and he's got a pretty good idea. By calling her ""Mrs. Woodcock"" when he probably knows she's no such thing, he is signalling that he respects her and recognizes her place in Reynolds's life. He's not obliged to do any such thing -- Cyril is Reynolds's closest family in a legal sense and if the doctor had ignored Alma entirely and insisted on speaking only to Cyril, that would have been completely expected. But in that scene, we can see how Reynolds's illness shifts the power from Cyril over to Alma. Cyril talks to the doctor, but the doctor talks not to her but to Alma -- and when he does, he uses the title which Alma does not yet have, but which, thanks to this illness, she soon will. ",7rfe1t
dswke2g,"Should've called it 'mother!', or something.",7rfe1t
dt643z4,"I feel like a lot of people are seeing this movie as romantic, but I saw the opposite of that. I feel like this movie is about one person holding another captive. The movie opens with Reynolds catching and holding Alma captive, but eventually they switch roles toward the end of the film.

In the first half of the movie, Alma is hardly more than an animated dress to Reynolds. All her mannerisms and words annoy Reynolds. Everything she does is grating to Reynolds. He simply wants her to be nothing more than a dress that should only speak when spoken to. There is nothing romantic in this at all. Alma knows it, and she seeks out escapes from this.

The only time we see him advance on Alma sexually is after he's had too much to drink, as if that is the only time he can stomach having sex with her. 

I think Reynolds is, to some degree, queer. I think he has sexual differences to the other men around him in his time period, differences big enough that we see him avoid almost all contact with any other man in the film. He certainly does not want the male doctor to lay a finger on him. I don't think there is evidence in the film that he is specifically gay, and I don't think there is evidence that he sexually desires his mother (although maybe you could leap to that conclusion somehow).

However, he makes clear at the beginning of the film that he is incapable of marriage to a woman, for one reason or another, and his only sexual or romantic advances on Alma happen out of some sort of intoxication, whether it be from alcohol or from poisonous mushrooms.

Arguably, when Reynolds is of completely sober mind, having sex with a woman who he claims has the perfect figure does not come naturally to him. I think the experience he had as a child, feverishly preparing a dress for his mother and the ecstasy he arrived at in the process, completely overshadowed his sexual maturation in his adolescence, or it overshadowed some kind of maturation on his part that has disrupted his sexuality to some degree. 

And when he is pampered by a woman, pampered in a way that makes him once again feel the warmth he felt from his mother's love, only then is he able to relax, to be romantic, or to even be sexual.

Alma says at some point in the first half of the film that Reynolds is only loving when he is sick. For a good deal of the movie, we can safely come to the conclusion that Alma is looking to kill Reynolds with the poisonous mushrooms, so that she can escape or maybe achieve some revenge for lost time.  

However, it all starts to become clear when he hallucinates seeing his mother alive again, and he sees her in the same room with Alma, who is preparing things for Reynolds and trying to comfort him. Both Reynolds and the audience at this point begin to associate Alma with Reynolds' own mother. 

And at some point, he even realizes he's being poisoned, and Alma even outright just tells him he is being poisoned. He is now the one being held captive, and their roles have switched. And in that moment he lets Alma and the audience know that he is complicit in the affair, that he is achieving some sort of satisfaction out of the whole thing, too. He is able to see his own mother in Alma. ",7rfe1t
dsx40qh,"Ok, here is a bit of a counter opinion. I found the film tediously slow and hinging on boring. The acting was, without a doubt, fantastic, but the story left me disengaged and, doing something I rarely do in a theater, checking my watch.

dswqy32,"I absolutely loved this film. The central relationship is endlessly enthralling, and both of the main characters feel incredibly fresh. 

I particularly love the way certain scenes/conversations sort of “unlock” other scenes. For example, the conversation they have about Reynolds’ world being a “game” and how Alma can’t play it comes back into relevance when Reynolds is complaining to his sister that Alma doesn’t “fit with his life.” 

Of course, more importantly, the scene where Alma first makes Reynolds sick and he hallucinates about his mother, only to have Alma return and “take her place,” wonderfully lays the groundwork for the later evolution of their relationship into a weirdly maternal, forced dependency. I thought the scene towards the end where he seems to figure out she’s poisoning him and he so gleefully embraces it was one of the weirdest and best scenes PTA’s ever done. Just brilliant all around, and on top of the twisted relationship drama, the film was luscious to look at and listen to. ",7rfe1t

A couple stray thoughts

* The first half of this film is /r/GirlsMirin the movie. So much staring.
* The omelette scene is my favorite single scene of the year. I was on the edge of my fucking seat and my mind was racing.
* From the first mention of the poison mushrooms, I thought she had murdered Woodcock and the Alma interview was a kind of confessional. Glad it didn't go that route.

-

Did anyone feel the parallels between Woodcock and DDL's career? Maybe this is obvious *or* maybe I'm reading into it too much, but it was the perfect punctuation at the end of DDL's acting career (which I doubt is over). The obsession over his craft and the distaste for anything that gets in his way; I thought this during the scene when Woodcock is complaining about ""chic"" fashion in particular. Woodcock/DDL work tirelessly to put everything into their art, layering in attention detail that you may never even see but you will know is there -- all to just have the masses throw their money at the next garbage fashion/movie that comes along. ",7rfe1t
dszzx6w,"This is the first movie in a while where I feel the trailers I saw in the theatre really changed my viewing of the movie. All of the trailers made it look like he was a troubled genius and that this woman would be a curse for him. It appeared she was only toying with him and that she was going to torture him. For the first half of the movie I was just waiting for her character to break and show herself to be conniving.

Imagine my surprise that during the entire movie *he* was the volatile asshole and she played someone genuinely in love, exactly the opposite of the trailers. 

I feel like she was trying out different avenues to get to him. She tried to play the doting wife. She tried to rile him up and get him to argue by cooking him food the wrong way. She took her time and didn't give up on him until she found what he wanted.

For that reason I, like the audience, had a ""this can't be real"" reaction to the twist when he swallowed the mushrooms. That tension while he slowly chews and of all the ways you expect it to go, you least expect him to get turned on by it. While I felt that moment was supremely absurd I must admit I also felt it was sublime. It was unexpected yet somehow totally appropriate.

I do not often like Paul Thomas Anderson movies. I disliked Magnolia, tolerated The Master and while I admit There Will Be Blood is a beautiful movie if I am honest I can't say I really love it. But that twist in this movie made me feel something I've never felt before ... a profound absurdity. I mean, bordering on so stupid I want to roll my eyes and yet at the same time filled with the deepest mysteries of human experience. It almost makes me wish someone loved me enough to poison me ... I can't even explain that.

My own theory is that his character was incapable of letting his guard down. He tells the story of how he worked so hard on his mother's dress and how he had no one to help him, except his sister. After his mom dies he feels like he must bear all of the stress of his art on himself, with only his sister at his side. It is only during moments of complete collapse (maybe depressive episodes) where he allows himself to be vulnerable enough to be taken care of.

She realizes that his inability to let go of his responsibilities is driving him crazy. He is not lashing out because he hates her, he is lashing out because he can't release his own stress. By poisoning him she is giving him that release of stress and putting him in a position where he has no choice but to be taken care of. She makes his vulnerability safe.

In the same way I didn't love There Will Be Blood, I don't think I love this movie. I do respect it for the absurdity and for the portrait of a complex and flawed genius. It is definitely a love story like no other.",7rfe1t
dsxklvm,"Saw it yesterday at a matinee with a bunch of old women. Once the credits hit, an old bag behind me said to her friend ""well that was different..."" (I'm from Minnesota).

I loved it, extremely beautifully shot and the entire movie has a bubbling subtle intensity to it. DDLs performance was solid yet understated but Alma killed it - Very impressed with her acting. When I first saw the trailer I was kinda like ""what is this dull downton abbey looking bullshit"" but ultimately PTAs weirdness and gravitas shone through and made for a bizarre, mildly disturbing take on love. And Jonnys score is so unabashedly beautiful, like holy shit, it's fucking sublime. His best score yet and it's not even close.

dswqji0,"One thing I've been obsessing over is Jonny Greenwood's score, specifically ""House of Woodcock"" and how it's in the same key as Fiona Apple's ""Waltz (Better Than Fine),"" and how both are clearly influenced by Bill Evans' ""Waltz for Debby,"" though Apple's song's got Jon Brion's whimsy and whereas Greenwood leans on Bach and Baroque, and remember that Anderson used to collaborate with Brion, and that Apple and Anderson used to date. This is all gossip column speculation, but it's just... I don't know. PTA said he was inspired to write this story while he was bed-ridden and his wife, Maya Rudolph, took care of him to an almost Annie Wilkes degree, and while that's probably true, I suspect Apple's got some sort of role in this movie.

After all, in *Rebecca*, on which *Phantom* is loosely inspired, both the movie by Hitchcock and the novel by Daphne du Maurier (if you read it, you will find SO many lines, phrases, and overall similarities to the whole of *Phantom Thread*), the second wife of Mr. Maxim de Winters is haunted by memories of his first wife Rebecca, just how Reynolds Woodcock compares Alma to his mother and previous lover.

But in the end, I think the movie is about closure. Not just with Daniel Day-Lewis' retirement (I doubt it), but how Reynolds and Alma end up settling themselves in their own unique situation.

I haven't had enough time to flesh these thoughts out, don't really think it's entirely worth it, but these were just my thoughts as of this moment. Thanks for reading!",7rfe1t

-Parents have a pronounced and terrible affect on their children.


-In many ways, this movie has the same weird battle of dominance-romance thing as Freddie and Master in The Master. 


-Brings the viewer into into a meticulously realized sub-world ala Boogie Nights with porn, TWBB with oil, Hard Eight with Vegas, Magnolia with game shows/cops, etc, Inherent Vice with L.A. in the 70s, The Master with scientology.  


-Woodcock says ""secrets"" in the same way Freddie does in The Master RE: his magic booze.

dswk9up,"Brilliant film, top 3 for 2017 for me and probably my favorite Greenwood score to date.

One question though, and I’ll need a second viewing to confirm but I wanted some other opinions:

**Is Reynolds already on-board/aware of what’s going on when we, the audience, see Alma first poison him with the tea?**

Seems like a lot of early film reviews think Reynolds was unaware and kind of “figured it out” when she was making the omelette.

But I kind of interpreted that at THAT point in the film (when she poisons him with the tea), they were already deep into their submissive role playing game. Reynolds is too meticulous a man not to notice something off about the tea, and the odd smile they share when the doctor first leaves makes me think they’ve already been doing this (maybe not to this extent yet) power play for quite some time already.",7rfe1t

Like life, his endings are strange and messy. Any form of stasis, no matter how apparently benign, is inherently off-kilter. All of his dynamics feel deeply psychological - half the joy of these films is in the psychoanalysis of their characters.

dtdpi9k,"Seeing it for the second time yesterday solidified it as one of my favorite 2 movies of the last 12 months. Also I'm wondering if anyone else got this from the film:

In addition to the ""Reynolds really just wanted a nurturing mother"" reading, did anyone else see Alma and his relationship as mirroring his relationship with his art/craft? Even before she poisons him the first time, it is shown that after these highs he got to from these shows, he would crash for a couple days. And of course when he finds out that she is the one poisoning him, he submits to it and relishes in a life of ups and downs.

It got me thinking about how I know the movie was made, basically co-written by DDL and PTA. Even a couple days ago I was listening to a podcast with PTA and he was talking about the highs and then the crashes that come with movie making. And then with DDL wanting to get out of acting (specifically his own style of intensive method acting) after this film, I wondered if perhaps at least the inspiration for this story and the character's relationship dynamics came from both of their experiences with their art and from feeling like they've been tethered to its highs and lows.

dsx5uea,"I'll have to disagree that this doesn't resemble his other work. It's a Paul Thomas Anderson film, through and through, playing almost directly towards thematic concerns that have driven almost all of his work: an attempt for substantial connection in a world that doesn't inherently provide it (*There Will Be Blood* is the antithesis of this, which, I think, is why it plays so well for most people.) This almost feels like the inverse of *The Master*, with an already defined gentleman being intertwined with an outside perspective. In both cases, however, this perspective is of a ""lesser"" class, and Alma's motivations seem to be rooted in the kind of awareness that was absent from Freddie Quell. 

The back and forth mental dance between the two feels jarring at first because their inner lives aren't directly expressed to us, which is, I think, by design. The film is narrated from a perspective who isn't the main character. We hear her words, but she isn't the one whose inner world is defined. She remains a mystery, more so than Woodcock. Her presence looms over the story, what with her fireside talk and intriguing smile (not to mention those piercing eyes), almost like a ghost. The two feel like a yin and yang by the film's end, as twisted as it may seem, but there still remains an air of mystery by that final frame, no matter how content the surface appears.",7rfe1t

I felt like the natural ending was Alma leaving him. I thought it would've been perfect to see an older Woodcock, his sister now passed away, back full circle to square one, alone in a cafe, where his age is against him and a younger waitress doesn't take as kindly to his flirting, leaving him alone and dejected. Instead, he just pulls out his sketch book and gets back to work; his one true real love. Would've been fitting, considering the lonley nature of his character. 

The whole mushroom thing, to me anyway, just seemed forced in order to come away with a happier ending, which just didn't feel justified. I'm sure I'll grow to love it in time though.",7rfe1t

dt0h1gv,"While I watched the movie, I loved the acting, the cinematography, and (especially) the score.  I just could not really get into the plot and I really felt like very little happened.  I read some reviews elsewhere and some on this site and figured that I'd think it over, but I still really don't get it.  

If it's all about Reynolds needing a mother figure, why does he spend 80% of the movie treating Alma like a child?  Why does he keep her around and insist that she be so meek?  But more importantly, why does Alma love him?  That's the biggest mystery here.  She talks at the beginning of the movie to the doctor about loving high society and the fact that he loves her, but surely she could escape him at the end and still remain in high society with the doctor (who, by all indications, liked her more than Reynolds at that point).  Yet she chooses to poison her bully and stay with him?  Why?

I could see how the omelet scene could be a riveting realization that Alma wants to mother/nourish and Reynolds needs to be mothered.  I could see how the audience could, go ""A Ha!"" at the idea it turns him on had the movie been set up different.  The problem is the movie doesn't really lead us there well at all.  Again, I still have no idea why Alma would want that.  And if hallucinating his mother was supposed to be the realization, then I just can't grapple with the fact that he infantilized Alma after that and chided her in high society.

As far as I can tell, it's a beautiful movie where very little happens.  I can live with that if there's some sort of sort or interesting message or realization at the end.  I just don't think that ever came together here.",7rfe1t

I'm not sure at exactly what timestamp that is in the film, but for the first hour or more, I was completely enthralled. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. It was almost like some sort of suspense/thriller, despite it just being a romantic drama. I didn't want it to end. If the rest of the film was like what I was witnessing, I knew I'd be disappointed with the (for PTA) short runtime. 

Once they got married, though, it lost my attention. I no longer cared about their relationship or what might happen to it. I had no idea what was going to happen next, and unlike in the first half, that was a bad thing. Any film that doesn't have me checking my watch (and there have been a lot of those recently- this has been a great year for movies) is considered well done, in my opinion. But after the marriage, I considered consulting my watch.

PTA fanboy. You couldn't find someone who appreciates PTA and his films more than I do. I think Inherent Vice is the best film he's made, and I made that decision after viewing it for the sixth time. Have the poster hung in my basement. I could watch all of his films on a loop for days. A lot of them are long, and I want them to be longer, so I can spend more time with the characters. So I went into this film expecting a similar rollercoaster ride. I was let down. Maybe it was just my expectations. Everything was beautiful, performances were great, it gripped me for a substantial portion of the film, one of Greenwood's best scores. Everything about it was 100% PTA at his finest. Until they got married. My attention started wandering, and it didn't pick up again until the last fifteen minutes or so. As a result, the impact of the ending was lost on me. By all accounts, it should have been a sucker punch to the gut, but it just wasn't. If the film had maintained the momentum throughout, it would have been. Instead, the ending just seemed aloof to me.

Even though this movie was so rich as far as the locations, food, and clothing there were parallels there between Plainview and Woodcock(to a lesser extent Lancaster Dodd since PTA had parts in the master where that character was show to be full of shit). Men so consumed with their desires to create something and their abilities to bend others to that intense will. With Plainview he had sort of a hard rival in Paul Dano's preacher and in this sort of a soft rival in Alma but still equally as fierce. In both characters it seems everything around them is so deliberate and measured and they see the people around them as tools(HW Plainview/Alma/Cyril).

He acts and she reacts as though he's being charming or charismatic, but he came off as deviant, eccentric or even downright weird during their initial exchange and especially their first date. The conversation regarding his mother was like something out of a slasher flick, to be followed shortly by Woodcock shrieking insults as he hacks Alma's limbs off with a cleaver.

Cyril acts as the mother who spoils their child, makes sure everything is perfect for them at all times, fulfills every indulgence asked and never really challenges them to grow. Alma comes along and becomes the stricter mother figure who challenges them on their childishness,  their unreasonableness, going so far as to literally make him eat his green vegetables.  

I think this duality of the two mother figures in Reynolds life is demonstrated perfectly in the scene after his first poisoning where the doctor comes and asks for ""Mrs Woodcock"" to which they both answer showing how they both see themselves as his primary caregiver.

This is a story driven by its characters’ actions, anchored in the most intimate aspects of their personalities, that clash at increasingly tense proportions.

Something about this one didn't seem as... tight as something like Magnolia. I also would argue that the character study and ""development"" in There Will be Blood is more substantial, but I also feel like that's because there really is only one character to focus on in that movie. So taking it from the tight screenplay perspective:

To me, a lot of the themes, motifs, scenes and characters didn't really connect entirely. Reynold's hunger is both representative of his voracious drive in his work and his need for a nourishing figure, which Alma provides (get it... because Latin..?).  This also links back to Reynolds' relationship with his mother faintly, as the nourisher is the position one would assume a mother would take. The mother thread is kind of cut there though, with the exception of two of what I would see as dead end threads. The first is the dressmaking, which is Woodcock's career but I would argue is hardly a focus in the movie. There's very little about dressmaking in this movie that could not be substituted with something like designing jewelry or hair dressing. The next one is the superstition, and this is where I really feel like the movie drops the ball. Superstition is why he hides secrets in the garments, which doesn't really go anywhere, why he sees his mother when he's sick, which isn't necessary to imply a Munchausen-Oedipus complex (I think a lot of the audience would have guessed it simply from the association of ""Alma Mater""). Perhaps it stands as the catalyst of his meticulous behavior but I would call that a stretch. Finally, I did not see the importance of the sister character, Cyril. Her character seemed less predictable and less effected by their mother, almost to the point that I question why she had to be a sibling. She may or may not have fallen to the superstition of not becoming a bride, or perhaps that was her decision; she seems like the type to be independent. I enjoyed her presence very much but I didn't see how she connected to the rest of the story or characters or themes. 

Don't get me wrong, to me, this movie is still a 7 or an 8 out of 10. But I'm seeing a lot of people call it one of PTA's best, or best of 2017 by a long shot, and I don't quite see that. Please help me find the Phantom Threads that connect all of these things :)",7rfe1t

Considering how much they emphasized that line in the trailers, I thought it was going to have a greater/more interesting role in the film. 2) I was waiting for it to turn into a crime drama, and it never did. Of course, that wasn't all - I wouldn't have minded if there was no crime aspect. I was just waiting for any twist whatsoever and it never came. I guess the twist was supposed to be that he was actually into the idea of being routinely poisoned, but I wasn't impressed by it. 3) mainly just wasted potential. There are so many ways this movie could have gone, and I feel like it had so many good ideas - but nothing came of it. The ending was just a great wholloping *nothing.* 4) too much art, not enough substance. Cinematography, editing, direction, acting, etc all perfect. There was just absolutely nothing to the story. Doctor, or Alma's interview with him throughout the movie in the narration? Not important. His relationship with his mother and sister? Apparently not important. If there's something to all those things, then it's just too subtle. Like that lady who was crying all the time, and they took the dress of her - I thought that was going to turn into something too, and it never did.

dt01mm8,"I absolutely loved it. 

I loved following Reynold's psychology and trying to figure out how his mentality was changing throughout the movie. He started out with a solipsistic worldview, in which he needed control over everything down to the last stitch. Then, Alma comes along and breaks that mentality. 

For two-thirds of the movie we see everything through Reynold's eyes. Then, she poisons him and awakens a predatory need to nuture within herself. The two settle into a macabre, deranged synthesis where each satisfies needs in the other that they didn't know they had before.


",7rfe1t

Just as Reynolds hid messages in his dresses, PT Anderson hides messages in his films. Some things I'm sure no one will ever know. Others are there for the astute observer.

I thought the pacing was fine and matched the style of the film very well but just how slow everything was kept me from enjoying the film as much as I wanted to. 

Despite that, I still think I'll watch it again eventually just because of how incredibly fluid PTA was with the camera. There were so many amazing shots in this film. In particular, my absolute favorite was when Reynolds and Alma were sitting on a couch talking and the camera was very very slowly moving through another room towards them for a take that seemed to go on forever.

It took a while to wrap my head around this and I get it, but I don't love it. It's the kind of movie that as a film critic or film aficionado, you're supposed to love.

Performances were wonderful. I thought Vicky Krieps' accent fluctuated a bit(?), but aside from that quibble, the three leads were great. However, the characters behaved so alien that it was hard to root for any of them (I came around on Cyril). I watched Reynolds and Alma decide to take the dress from Barbara Rose through my fingers. Day-Lewis gave me *Psycho*-vibes throughout the entire movie. 

I suppose that the ending almost justifies this behavior. It turns out, it's not just me sensing the fucked vibe; they actually are fairly fucked up people.

I say *almost*, because the denouement after the reveal (from the baby carriage in the park to the credits) undercut the impact. If the movie had ended with Reynolds kissing Alma, I would've left the theatre shell-shocked. That decision—to soften that impact with another five minutes of denouement—underscores my main problem with the whole movie: If you're going for an off-kilter/darker vibe, commit to it.

There were a couple other examples that made me laugh as they came to mind while watching the film. One was Leo's character in Wolf of Wall Street. Dude was banging hookers left and right but he had a weekly appointment with a dominatrix. Another example was from the 5 Days to Air South Park doc. Trey mentioned that he loves to play and build Legos cause having someone else telling him how to work allows him to let off steam. 

Obviously the dynamic in the Phantom Thread isn't identical to those other two, but they kind of allowed me to recognize what was going on in this movie early on. That said I didn't find the overall story all that interesting. I'm into fashion and was expecting it to be more about Woodcock in the actual fashion industry, so perhaps my initial expectations were let down.

dt2hwpu,"I'm a die hard PTA fan but I just couldn't get into this film. His craft as a director is still as incredible as ever but after the Master it feels as if his screenplays have lost focus.  
I know he made a lot of comparisons to himself and Reynolds Woodcock in interviews leading up to the film, so it made me a little uncomfortable that the movie seemed to insinuate that his relationship was detracting from his ability to create at his fullest potential. And also that Alma was intentionally making him weak and vulnerable so that she could take care of him and have an opportunity to gain his full attention.  I may be reading too much into it but I just felt a little iffy about what many on here claim to be a ""romantic comedy"". PTA has created so many vibrant characters in his previous films but here it seems he's crafted a very cold and anti-social portrayal of an artist whose only motivations seem to be finding a mother figure and creating flawless work who only marries his infatuated love interest to appease her need for acceptance. Alma's motivations don't seem to warrant all she has to endure with Reynolds, especially when she has to make him physically ill to receive any appreciation from him.  
I don't know, maybe I'm reading way too much into this but it feels as if Anderson may be entering his secluded hermit Kubrick phase of his career",7rfe1t
dt72stf,"This film (and yes I’ll call it a film even though I think it’s pretentious, but this deserves it in a good way) completely blew me away. I was ready to walk out to see lady bird like 30 mins in. I thought that this was like a lifetime movie for old women. I was completely wrong. This was one of the best movies I’ve ever seen. A true masterpiece. Maybe because I’m a big fan of psychological movies, or maybe because I also have control freak and loner creative tendencies, but it was so expertly made that I think many can enjoy this film.

I like PT Anderson. I’m not a super fan or anything. None of his movies have been this sophisticated and refined. The Master bordered on it, but didn’t have such a strong storyline. I also liked Boogie Nights for just being purely entertaining and taking us into the porn world, even though it was too long. The rest of his movies are a bit heavy handed (haven’t seen inherent vice).

Phantom thread is so strong. We get the obsessive controlling personality from Daniel day lewis in there will be blood, but without being so heavy handed. We get this dance of control between him and his wife. We get the jealousy and paranoia of love that has been intensified when you are such an intense person. We get the subtle rules of high English society and the desire to break free of those hidden rules. We get the waning hate and love that comes from a relationship. And then we get this delightfully f’ed up diabolical, controlling masochistic “fetish” that makes you see love in a completely new light, and completely blindsided me. A twist in an unexpected way.

I could see PT pulling experiences probably from his own life and relationships. I also work in the film world and have had my share of jealous girlfriends who see me working around beautiful actresses and models. I can only imagine what a top Hollywood director experiences with their significant others. It must be filled with paranoia and jealousy and I can tell the PT took experiences from his own life and wrote them in. That’s why the story is so expertly crafted.

This is the best work from PT Anderson, and being that PT is such a skilled filmmaker, it is one of the best films of all time.",7rfe1t

It's a weird movie for me, I found myself enjoying it, but I just wasn't entirely into the resolution being he is just a giant child in search of a lady who will provide him the motherly love.

I also thought it didn't really have an ending. It had a resolution of sorts, but I would have rather they just cut out the point where she's talking to the doctor or at least it clarifies what the purpose of those scenes are. I think the movie wants you to assume that she killed him with love and mushrooms till he couldn't take it anymore and that was her confession. I was not entirely satisfied with the abrupt ending. I thought there were some scenes missing to even get to that point. I also think the fact that the movie has such brief scenes with them in love and then they immediately go back to this weird back and forth love and resentment cycle. It was off putting to me. I never really got the sense they were in love with each other at all. 

The score by Johnny Greenwood is fantastic. I think the most impressive part of the score is Greenwood's very adept ability to tap into the legacy of scores from folks like Lyn Murray, Franz Waxman, Alfred Newman and Dimtri Tiomkin. I would not be surprised to hear that before writing this score he looked and listened closely to a bunch of their scores and original score sheets before writing. I think it would take some very deep research to write that specifically for this movie because it really does capture those specific sounds of romantic scores like Rebecca and  The Song of Bernadette.

ALL SPOILERS AFTER THIS:

I mean, who knew anyone would ever try to put a positive spin on Munchausen by proxy syndrome? 

Which is to say, 3/5ths of the way into the film the director 'drops' on us that the 'love interest' is a monster. Yeah, the seemingly mildly autistic dress designer is somewhat obnoxious, but come on people -  like POISONING him is in any way justified???  Even thought it eventually turns on he is a pathetic masochist who enjoys being tortured it is still no excuse for the monsters' actions.

And what does any of this have to do with the world of high fashion in the 1950's? 

NOTHING

When this film eventually gets around to revealing its sadomasochistic heart - it turns out none of  the window dressing has anything to do with it. Really, the film would have been better if it was set in the modern day - maybe an autistic MacMansion owner in Cleveland hiring a maid/mistress. Then at least it could have focused more on the psychodrama and less on meaningless distractions.

As with There Will Be Blood and the Master, Anderson touches on interesting themes of human beings drive to dominate, be dominated vs. a desire for autonomy - but as with those films this one is a bunch of interesting 'ideas' thrown together without any real coherent center.

dt3nj48,"Does anyone else feel that PTA kind of wings it with his films, sometimes to the detriment of his films?

I say this as a person who was a *die-hard* PTA fan for so many films, culminating with TWBB. When I saw the trailer for The Master, I was so, so excited. But with that film, Inherent Vice and now Phantom Thread, I feel like PTA enjoys creating characters and finding interesting worlds more than having compelling plots.

I don't point this out as a mistake PTA has made/is making, or that he is wrong to do this, but I do feel like his best films had a tremendous sense of *escalating conflict* in their plots.

In Punch-Drunk Love, the pressure from his sister and the phone sex hotline woman and the four blond brothers just builds and builds.

In There Will Be Blood, you get a sense of Daniel Plainview slowly going insane over the years, culminating in him living alone in his huge mansion, almost like Dracula.

I think one could argue that The Master has a sense of escalating conflict, but Phantom Thread felt mostly one note. I felt like with the certain dangerous power play that Alma makes, the movie was getting into interesting territory, but it never moves beyond that. 

I'm sure I'm in the minority, but I feel like he's become much looser with his films over the years (starting with Punch-Drunk Love) and the result is much looser plots that lack any sense of urgency or conflicts that develop beyond an initial setup (Freddie/The Master, Alma/Reynolds).",7rfe1t

PTA films are the only ones that make me feel the way Miyazaki’s do. The latter being of course anime and totally different.

But they both capture such a *mood* that I stay in for a few days after where I just want to be apart of the life I watch in their work. Something about them are just so romantic that I get this warm feeling inside, this comfort. I just want to soak it all up and wish they wouldn’t end. The music is something else that I always find myself wanting in other films, but Greenwood just nails it on the head here. 

The Master is my favorite film, but if Phantom Thread stands the test of time for me, it might surpass it. 

Edit: did anyone else’s theater sound like it made the keyboard parts in the score distorted? Not in a bad way honestly, just like on the louder parts where it made it gave it an “analog” sound. I’m listening to the soundtrack now and it sounds pretty clean. ",7rfe1t

Alma reminded me of the lady from that recent Aziz Ansari allegation, she could have just left at any fucking time.

Also, so what was the point of her talking to somebody throughout the film, obviously she now knows that she poisoned him and the movie ends without the police ever being informed?

She’s very drunk at their own wedding, husband no where to be seen, and a person who she cares about sends someone into her bed to take her clothes off? 

For me that scene felt like both woodcock and Alma been very cruel. Alma being drawn into this idea that you can disregard other people in the name of “work”. It’s also I think the first time he shows her any kind of passionate affection and yet doesn’t return her “I love you”. Made me feel like he was just super egomaniacal.",7rfe1t

dt13sqr,"This was my initial reading as well. A bunch of lines in the film liking Woodcock’s behavior to a “stubborn child”, and the scenes where Alma cares for him when he’s sick definitely seemed motherly upon watching, paired with the appearance of his dead mother in the room. Also, for a two hour film focused almost entirely on a romantic relationship, there was a very surprising lack of references to sex or lust of any kind (pretty sure that one scene he takes her to his room is the only one, and even that was really minimal). I think this was definitely a purposeful move on PTA’s part, because this isn’t a conventional relationship that Woodcock desires, but rather someone to nurture him and show him affection in a way that only a mother could. Hadn’t even considered the fact that she literally makes him eat his vegetables though lol, great analysis!",7rfe1t

""He likes a little belly.""

Or whatever the line was. Referencing a motherly body perhaps?",7rfe1t
duqh630,"I think the mother theme was the most brilliant part of the script.

Early on, the movie drops three hints (talking with the sister, and telling Alma abuot the hair in the jacket, and the wedding dress) that the man has some mommy issues. Checkov's gun is loaded.

Then the theme ""goes away"", until he is poisoned and he sees his mother who is then ""replaced"" by Alma, and you hear Checkov's gun go off and it hits like a ton of bricks.",7rfe1t
duoa7a0,"I don't think he wanted a mother. His mother was the only woman he truly respected, with Cyril maybe being a faraway second. He respected his mother, because his mother had power and control over him (literally, as a little child, one is dependent on one's mother), and he couldn't subjugate her to his whim like he does with all the other women in his life. On their first date, he tells Alma that he has to be strong, and she tells him that he is pretending. He didn't have to pretend with his mother. But he had to pretend with everyone else, and that's why he was so strict and demanding, because the slightest flaw would create a crack in his ""strong facade."" He didn't want to always have to be strong and demanding. He did, on some level, want a more equal, emotional, soft, and loving relationship, but he didn't know how and he was afraid to go there, lest his give up some of his strength and ego. When he gets ill, his strength and power are taken away from him by force, so he has no choice but to appreciate, respect, and love those who take care of him, like Alma. But his strength and control must be taken from him by force, with him having no say in matter; he is not able to give it up on his own accord. But at the same time, he does long for that softer relationship and to not always have to be strong and in control, which is why he responds positively when Alma tells him she poisoned him again *after he already swallowed the omelet.*",7rfe1t

ducsuqi,A little late to the game here but I think this is a fantastic read!,7rfe1t
e05sqv6,"I know I'm like, 4 months late, but I think what this movie was really about was control. Woodcock attempts to control Alma to make up for the lack of control he felt his mother. In essence, the only way he can understand to love people is to control them. This fails though, as Alma starts to recognize the ""nature of Woodcock's game"". This leads her to flip the power dynamic around, and control the controler. In a twisted away, Anderson suggests that that is the only love that the two lovers can feel. One in which Alma becomes powerful enough to control Woodcock. ",7rfe1t

I always saw her being name Alma as a sly reference to Hitchcock's wife, as this movie is PTA's own Rebecca of sorts. Alma Reville was the unsung silent partner to good old Hitchcock, working out the stories and writing a lot of the early ones. ",7rfe1t
dt0k6gp,"> I think the film plays with gender roles also.

On that note, I found it really interesting the way he was portrayed as this great man in his field yet it gets explained and then shown just how very dependent everything is on the women around him to bring it to fruition. First told in his tale about his sister saving him with his mother's dress then shown with Alma completing the ruined dress. ",7rfe1t
dtog9on,"I totally agree. [For me the poisoning was about him being infantalized.](#spoiler)

[During the first poisoning, close to death, he sees his mother and is basically reaching out to her for comfort, something she can no longer give him. At the same time, Alma returns to the room and goes about taking care of him. There is also a part of Alma's dialogue where she describes Reynold's bouts of depression earlier in their relationship. She fondly describes him as tender and like a baby.](#spoiler)

[For me, the ""Phantom"" refers to the figurative ghost of Reynolds mother. And the ""Thread"" is how that relationship now ties Alma and Reynolds together. He wants to be infantalized and cared for. She wants to mother and care for this weakened being who can be so harsh, distant and overwhelming in normal life.](#spoiler) 

[There's also a bit of an S&M aspect that makes sense for someone who in their work life is constantly in control and demanding. This behavior must feel like an absolute release for him. You can see a bit of this between him and his dominatrix-like sister. Someone who, until now, has been his sole comfort.](#spoiler)",7rfe1t

Something about his recent films is so elusive, but in a brilliant, deliberate way. They haunt you. I know that I loved it and will see it again many times in my life. In the scene where Woodcock was delirious and seeing his mother in her wedding dress, I couldn't help but be reminded of Freddie Quell in The Master, with his ""crying spells"" and ""visions"" of his mother. Anderson is really fascinated with the shadow (whether positive or negative) that parents inevitably cast over the lives of their children.

So, when alma is sitting by the fire, talking about Reynolds- the scene it keeps cutting back to throughout the movie- who is she talking to? The young doctor? Or is she talking to Reynolds? Because at the end of the movie, he’s laying in her lap by the fire and she’s stroking his hair. At the end of the movie she says that she imagines the future with him. So I wondered if some of the things we saw were just her and him sitting by the fire and her imagining the future. That’s what I thought was happening with the second poisoning scene. Cause it seemed so bizarre, in a wonderful way of course haha. I loved the movie and can’t wait to see it again!",7rfe1t
dsxnwp0,"Most of that is pretty clear while watching it, percolating on superficial levels (name the characters for what they stand for) not subtle (in case the naming mechanism isn’t strong enough let’s make all of their physical interactions obvious of their dynamic) and in the end the payoff was laughable (let’s take a movie that’s aesthetic  for 85% of the film is austere realism and and then make a left turn into absurdism.  Technically the movie is fantastic with regards to the acting, cinematography and score. Nonetheless, for a film about haute couture fashion, the costume designs were uninteresting & the production design was very boring.  This film had so much potential and had so much going for it but the conclusion of its thesis is where this film falls apart.  I mean it’s ideas on power dynamics aside, when you look at its arguments on toxic relationships, it literally gets its hands dirty with toxicity. I think the response and the accolades with this film has more to do with it’s “shocking” resolution then it’s potential longevity to be seen as a masterpiece of independent cinema. ",7rfe1t

*There Will Be Blood* is my favorite movie, and I was excited to see this, but I did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did. Very intense. I found myself short of breath at times. I felt the horror.

I've listened to him in interviews (most recently on The Bill Simmons Podcast) and he's a funny guy who just is great at his craft. He says he has a slightly different sense of humor where he finds it funny when people are just way too serious and committed to something that's so over the top. The baptism scene in *There Will Be Blood* comes to mind -- it's such a strong scene but you can see Daniel Plainview thinking that it was all so ridiculous.

I didn't really like *The Master* at the time I saw it (I really have to re-watch it) but PTA said that there were a lot of scenes that he thought were hilarious but didn't really land with audiences as much as he hoped.

dsxqtg0,"I also saw this movie at the Music Box for the 70mm presentation. My audience was “uproarious” as well—perhaps you and I were at the same showing. I absolutely loved this movie. I’ll admit to being a PTA stan upfront since I can barely find a flaw in any of his films. 

>	I could watch the scenes of DDL driving on repeat for eternity. They were immaculately shot, and captured the feeling of driving/acceleration really well, which is something I usually find lacking in cinema.

I cannot agree with this sentiment more, the driving scenes are sensational. You describe—perfectly—why those scenes work so well. There are, at least, a half-dozen scenes in this film that made me immediately think, “this movie is stunning” and the driving scenes are included in that half-dozen. The cinematography is immaculate and the score is beyond superb. 

>	the whole foundation of the film is built upon a relationship I never really believed in at any point which makes the film feel practically soulless

I would argue this film is not asking you to believe in their relationship rather to witness the shifting power dynamics of a relationship. This film is a battle of wills between two people with life-conquering obsessions. 

She’s just as obsessed with him as he is with his work. From the moment he wipes her lipstick off he’s exerting control. He controls everything around him, even the noise level. His relentless control overwhelms almost everyone else but not Alma and also not Cyril. The parallels between Cyril and Alma show the viewer the type of person required to survive being around Woodcock. Most tertiary characters in the film placate Woodcock and Cyril does to an extent but when it matters she does not hesitate to slap him down and Woodcock—somewhere deep down—respects that. Alma, eventually, refusing to be controlled learns a method for slapping him down and getting what she wants from him, granted it’s a dangerous and twisted method but it’s effective. Alma’s particular method also manipulates his desire to have his mother present as Alma plays the mother role of nurse/nurturer after she poisons him. She—essentially, in the most demented way possible—is hitting his reset button, which is what he thinks he needs as becomes exhausted from working too hard and is reduced, ridiculously, to infantile behavior. So, as they understand the other’s motivations they form this bizarre compatibility—this is romance for strange, obsessive people. And it’s completely within character as Woodcock keeps around only those that can withstand his overwhelming, controlling behavior while giving him what he needs and Alma remains herself and can love him the way she wants (paraphrasing her line from the movie). 

I’ve heard an interpretation of this movie in which Alma is an expert con artist. Now, obviously that’s not how I interpreted this film but I think that’s a fascinating theory that seems to hold up after a deep analysis of the film. And that’s the brilliance at work here by PTA, differing interpretations of a few scenes here and there and this movie is capable of sliding on a spectrum of genres for the audience. I can understand how some may actually see this as a quiet thriller just as easily as I can see how some may perceive this movie as a fresh take on the tortured/demanding genius motif. I see it as an absurdist romantic comedy mixed with some Hitchcock to add some layers of intrigue. This film is overflowing with some classic Hitchcock themes. 

>	Another thing I want to add is that I felt a little bit like an alien in my screening as I didn't feel this to be as much of a comedy as people are making it out to be. 

I am one of those people you refer to as I found it to be hilarious while simultaneously keeping me on the edge of my seat, waiting for the twisted turn. Obviously humor is subjective and if you didn’t find it that funny then so be it but I encourage you to see it a second time, especially with the slightly bizarre Hitchcockian romantic comedy lens. 

Lastly, I also agree that the performances are spectacular with DDL bringing his usual brilliance but I think it’s easy for people to walk out of the theatre thinking this film, at its core, is about Woodcock…it’s not, it’s about Alma. ",7rfe1t

I can't decide if I didn't get it, or if I did get it, and what was there to get I just didn't like.

du9vy9n,"For me this movie, and P.T. Anderson's other films, are just stories snapped out of a human history. And that's what makes them so magical. Imho he should always be making films with beautiful impressionist lilting piano and sweeping violins because it truly captures that human essence. Phantom Thread is just a story with characters who are people with quirks and traits and beliefs and act accordingly. Everything that happens makes sense, and effortlessly too. Motives or reasons aren't explained but they are in their unexplainedness. That look in Woodcock's eye when he finds her at the party, how many of us have given that look or received it, from who, and why? We know it, but we don't. It's just so unbearably real, all of it. The ambiguity of us in two hours of an eclectic fashion designer and his simple, conniving muse. 

I don't think the other settings in his films really captures that beauty, besides The Master maybe, and that's just because of the style or time period, but I think the gut of it remains the same, like an extended vignette almost.

Even when I was *slightly* disinterested in the middle third of the movie, I think the constant musical score held me in just enough to not get lost.

So many times I'll watch an enjoyable movie and then forget about it before I even get home. This one lingered in my mind for a while.

I wouldn't hold it against anyone if they found it boring though; it's definitely not a movie I would recommend for *anyone* to see.

This is all fascinating to read because I kept feeling PTA in Woodcock. That type of man (neurotic, fussy, confused) is common on PTA's films, and this is one of the few times we've seen a woman destabilize a man like that in his films. I kept thinking of his relationship with Maya, and how much that must have informed Phantom Thread, which, to me, is about lovers who know each other in ways only they can.

I didn't think about Fiona Apple though... probably because that was such an early relationship in his career, but I wouldn't be surprised if she's in Alma too.

I suggest going chronological. The earlier ones will suck you in. The Master, Inherent Vice, and Phantom Thread are just less 'Hollywood' than Boogie Nights, Magnolia, and There Will Be Blood if you ask me (the latter are not all that 'Hollywood' themselves, but still). Better to go chronological and watch the development; see PTA tell some more bombastic stories before he has the license to show something quieter. I think what I'm getting at is that PTA began to care less and less about being 'entertaining' and more and more about telling an interesting story, especially visually. As always, take it with a grain of salt and decide for yourself. PTA beats the Coens for me too.

 ",7rfe1t
dt033dh,"I feel like the house fitting scene perfectly set up the three main characters. Reynolds' mind never strays far from his work and he has little consideration for what others find comfortable (which is an interesting comment on fashion in general being more about the whims of the designer than the comfort of the clothes). Alma is opportunistic and excited by the romance of the unusual. She didn't seem uncomfortable *until* Cyril comes along. She is professional, always there to help her brother, with a strange jealousy of anyone who gets close to him. 

That scene, odd as it was, started off feeling somewhat warm. But then Cyril reared her head and the odd sibling symbiosis was introduced. Alma went from an odd, but romantic situation to a more cold, clinical environment with the introduction of his sister. And it sets up the fact that until Cyril is distanced from Reynolds, Alma will be a secondary figure in his life (tertiary if you count his pining for their mother). ",7rfe1t

Now we are talking.  But PTA wants him to surrender, see? ",7rfe1t
dt54d3x,HE DESERVES THAT AWARD. PHANTOM THREAD ALL THE WAY,7rfe1t
dt36naa,">  Why does he keep her around and insist that she be so meek? But more importantly, why does Alma love him? That's the biggest mystery here. She talks at the beginning of the movie to the doctor about loving high society and the fact that he loves her, but surely she could escape him at the end and still remain in high society with the doctor (who, by all indications, liked her more than Reynolds at that point). Yet she chooses to poison her bully and stay with him? Why?

The way I see it, their relationship is built on a fatal imbalance and the poison mushrooms are their equalizer. Under normal circumstances, Alma is constantly in a weaker position, because not only is she much younger and financially dependend on him, but also he's a control freak who feels comfortable only when he can impose rigid rules on those around him *and* he has his loyal sister around him, so when decisions are to be made, Alma is often outmanned two to one. In the beginning, she's so in love with him that she kids herself into thinking she can live with that, but as the movie goes on, we see her getting more and more frustrated by the situation. 

As for why she fell in love with him in the first place, I think pure physical attraction played a part (""You're a very beautiful man"", she tells him in one of their first scenes together) as did admiration for his art and his strength. As for him, he longs to have a mother figure to protect him, but at the same time, his need for control is so great that he can't just admit when he needs help. This is where the magic mushrooms come in. Alma discovers that she likes being the one in control when she tends to him when he's sick. It makes her feel useful and it also let's her see another, more tender side of him, which he usually tries to hide from her. Then, when she finally tells him about it, he immediately grasps that this is what he needs as well. When he's sick, his rigid control slides and he's able to enjoy being taken care of. ",7rfe1t
dt1go6k,"Hmmmmmm, I think she's not so much a child as she is a mannequin to him, which is like a symptom of his 'curse' rather than the cause. Hence that shot where they wake up at 4am and he's trying dresses on her (""i can stand longer than anyone""), or that earlier scene where we think they'll have sex but instead he just takes her measurements. + It seems like he's not totally aware that he could use a motherly figure until like, that last dinner scene. 

Alma's definitely mysterious tho. I'm not convinced she loves high society--she seems too free-spirited, and when they argue in private, she makes a point that for her, all these ppl are just playing a sort of fake game. Overall, outrageously, I think she prefers being romantically involved with a weak, helpless, old baby than a young, rich, confident doctor, which might say smthn about why we never see any sex scenes lol. 

Maybe she lost a child in the war, or a younger brother? Who knowsss. But she's sensitive about her past--like that banquet scene, the doctor says, this'll be the best party you ever been to. she counters, how do you know what I've been through? or that long dinner scene, where reynolds tells her to go back to where she came from, she's like, fuck this i'm done.

She's telling the story to the doctor, but while she's confidently imagining a baby and a bigger hand in the fashion business, it's really hard to imagine that actually happening. It's a lot easier to imagine her accidentally going too heavy on the mushrooms and killing or permanently disabling him, and her talk about babies and how they'll be together after death being as much of a dream as Reynolds's vision of his mother.

nope

>Woodcock craves female adoration

nope

>Like Andrew Neiman, Woodcock is obsessed with striving for perfection, and until he reaches it, he’ll never rest.

not really

>Woodcock too can’t sustain relationships as he views them as inferior to his true passion – his dresses.

definitely not

1. Reynolds certainly doesn't feel incomplete - he isn't bothered at the start of the film when Cyril floats dismissing his current muse, but rather bored by the conversation itself. Reynolds seems to be satisfied with the current arrangement of finding a muse for inspiration and dumping her when he gets bored. *Reynolds lives his entire life by strict order, and the film is about a disruption of this order*

2. Not in the slightest. Pay attention to the scene where the young girls approach him and compliment his dresses, saying they'd like to be buried in one. Note that you only see the girls through the gritty mirror behind them and the focus *never leaves Reynolds' face*, and he is quite bored and possibly offended by their interruption. 
Again, here we see an interruption of his order - he always sits at the same table in the same restaurant with Cyril. He doesn't crave female adoration in the slightest; rather, he wishes for his routine to continue unperturbed. 
Another example - he is very upset when Alma questions his taste when she states that she dislikes a certain fabric. If he was craving her adoration he would've changed the fabric or the shape but he was so rigid that he shouted her down. 

3. Reynolds believes he has already reached perfection, hence his being offended every time his perfect routine (perfect to him, not necessarily to the viewer) is interrupted by noise or unforeseen events. 

4. It's not that he refuses to sustain relationships because they're inferior to his dresses, but rather that the relationships serve as ""fuel"" for his dressmaking, fuel to be used and eventually dumped. Note that Reynolds only experiences failure, the wedding dress being ugly and the Countess going to a different house, after the chaotic element of Alma is introduced.

I think your conception of Reynolds' character is flawed which impacts the relevance of the rest of the review. Your mistake is looking at the relationship as any other, when it's clearly not - she is a force of chaos in his orderly world. 

For example, in the second paragraph you state that ""the two begin dating."" Where is this implied by the film? They have a relationship, sure, but is it one of romantic attraction? There are no sex scenes in the movie so a relationship of passion is out of the question. Before Reynolds kisses her after they steal the dress, there is no explicit romantic contact between the two of them. 

You begin to get at it when you note that Alma rarely does things quietly. But you don't discuss why - Alma seeks to establish herself within his world so as not to be cast aside like the muses before her. In fact, the reason he tires of the other muses so quickly is because they *don't* make noise and they *don't* interrupt his routine. 

For your future reviews, take care that your personal assumptions don't influence your reading of the themes. It's clear to me that your conception of Reynolds as craving romantic love and adoration and striving for perfection don't come from the film itself.",7rfe1t
dt1mp0g,The humor is very character-based though it never breaks the tension and it adds more unusual layers to the characters. The very small crowd in the theater I was at lightly chuckled and groaned at most of Reynolds' reactions to little things.,7rfe1t

dsx4xok,">The first is the dressmaking, which is Woodcock's career but I would argue is hardly a focus in the movie. There's very little about dressmaking in this movie that could not be substituted with something like designing jewelry or hair dressing.

I'd argue that Phantom Thread is less about dressmaking and more about the dressmaker in the way The Master was less about the cult and more about the cult leader. Dressmaking and Scientology (The Cause) are lenses through which PTA examines the men who partake in these respective... trades?

That being said, dressmaking is a significant element of the film, and one that wouldn't have supported its themes as effectively had it been substituted for necklaces or hairdressing. I say this because the dress is the thing. Yes jewelry and hairstyles are highlighted at awards shows and galas, but neither as much as the dress.

The first woman we see dressed by Woodcock tells him his dresses give her courage. It's a small, yet important moment because we see why Woodcock's work is meaningful to the women in this society, from princesses to fans who long to be clothed in his designs. Alma picks up on this, which is why her heroic/romantic gesture to rescue the dress from the soused Barbara Rose means so much to Woodcock.

Also, that extensive measurement scene with Woodcock, Alma, and Cyril wouldn't have been nearly as intimate, revealing, or potent were he sizing her up for a necklace or a hairdo. The dress allows PTA to explore so much more.

>The next one is the superstition, and this is where I really feel like the movie drops the ball.

Is it that you don't know why Woodcock's superstitious, or you don't like the way the film expressed his superstitions? I just saw him as a deeply neurotic dude, likely due to his mother's death. I wouldn't be surprised if the loss instilled in him the need to control his world. It's also clear that a lot of these neuroses stunted his maturation... hiding things in dresses seems like kid's play, his inability to handle anything that would discomfort him is childish, and his accusations that Alma's got a gun are absurd. But it all made sense to me. I don't know.

>Finally, I did not see the importance of the sister character, Cyril. Her character seemed less predictable and less effected by their mother, almost to the point that I question why she had to be a sibling.

That's interesting. I thought she was essential, and easily my favorite character in the film. It's easy to see that she would have been the first motherly replacement for Woodcock. She's as present in his life as his lovers it seems, and their association's intentionally blurred... him calling her his old so and so and what not. Even the scene where the doctor refers to Mrs. Woodcock, and both she and Alma respond. All of this exemplifies how intermingled these female relationships become to Woodcock. Are these women his mothers? Sisters? Lovers?

Also, the scene where he gets mouthy with her and she's all, ""Don't even start with me,"" is so fucking grand. That's a modern articulation of what she said, which was something along the lines if, ""I'll go right through you..."" or ""It'll be you who's on the floor."" She's a powerful, yet understated character, not unlike Amy Adams' Peggy in The Master. It's clear that Cyril's the most powerful woman in that house. Alma may have fought her way into Woodcock's heart, but I'd argue that getting past Cyril may have been a similarly difficult challenge.

>I'm seeing a lot of people call it one of PTA's best, or best of 2017 by a long shot, and I don't quite see that.

Ultimately that's okay, and I wouldn't worry about it. My relationship with PTA's films are always changing. I had no idea what to do with The Master when I saw it and now it's easily my favorite film of his. I don't know if any of what I wrote was helpful, but I've always found that rewatching PTA's films helps me see what I didn't before.",7rfe1t

The movie is clearly far more interested in the central relationships than it is the machinations of the fashion world. Just because the relationship could have worked in a different setting doesn't mean the movie is weaker for choosing the setting it did. I fail to see how the setting was a meaningless distraction or how the movie would have been improved by being set in present day--why could you focus on the psychodrama more if it took place in suburban 2018 rather than mid-century England? I just don't follow this reasoning.

One of the main ideas of the film I thought was that we all have our own type of love and happiness, that is unique to us, that is influenced/caused by our pasts. In the end do you think DDL was happier or worse off loving his wife in a weird motherly way? His past relationships were outrageously abusive and unorthodox to the woman he was with, maybe this weird relationship is the best for him and his personal happiness. ",7rfe1t

Reynolds mistakes her not caring for her being angry because she's losing, and they argue. After their argument, she stands up and creates a bit of a scene about how intolerable he is. Reynolds says, ""Next opponent!"" because he's taking the game night super seriously. A woman (presumably his next opponent) approaches him and asks (but says she's not being racist) if it's a custom in Alma's country to throw tantrums and says he married a toddler.",7rfe1t

His love for his mother is something he sought out by surrounding himself with women. He wanted to be loved and taken care of like his mother took care of him when he was little. There could be grander messages about gender and power(I don't think so though even though The Master has similar themes of power and submission), but I think it was just meant to be an examination of makes this man tick and do what he does. What is the phantom thread in our life that makes us tick or makes us happy? 

I took a class in personality psychology, the teacher taught this idea I guess was a part of psychoanalysis that we subconsciously seek things out that were caused by our early childhood or childhood. An exercise we did was pull up like 10 pictures from a magazine where there is something happening and you write for 5 minutes as quick as you can on one image. You do that for all 10 images. Then you look for patterns in the stories you wrote and this was supposed to provide some insight into what drives us subconsciously.

Having said that, on paper, Phantom Thread is a film I would probably have never seen (especially in a theater) if not for the people involved.

Then we find out she's talking to the doctor, still about Reynolds. A host of other questions - is this far after their relationship ends? Is she involved with the doctor? Is Reynolds even alive?

Then, beautifully, we find out after her speech about how ""loving him makes life no big mystery,"" we see that he's resting on her lap and has been there the entire film. 

Even while she calls him the ""most demanding man"" or is recounting how she poisoned him because ""it's good for him to slow down once in a while"" he has been there listening.

 Reynolds wants to be nourished and taken care of, but his nature makes it impossible for him to let people be in control of him even if it’s what he truly desires. He wants someone to mother him. When he’s sick, however, things are different, and he can finally let go and allow Alma to dote on him and mother him.

The man at the end was the doctor we see in other scenes throughout the film. Reynolds is concensually allowing Alma to poison him with the mushrooms, and the two of them are explaining to the doctor what she had done so that the doctor can give Reynolds an informed check up. 

Alma isn’t being a brat, she’s actually helping her husband in her own way. They’re both obviously happy with this situation, I’m not sure how you read into it otherwise. ",7rfe1t

dsx36hn,"Thank you!  My interpretation was that Alma was an equally stubborn person in her own way who was simultaneously frustrated by, but attracted to a man who was so set in his ways and successful because of it.  I think she could sense his unhappiness and a hidden desire within him to be set free from his self-made prison without explicitly asking for it (I think this part is important, and may be influenced by the ghostly presence of his mother in his life and the shame that comes with that).  For example, despite their arguments, he would continue to keep her in his life and His sewing messages into his work may be his way of whispering his hidden desires to the world without explicitly asking for anything and hoping that someone hears him. For example, Maybe ""Never Cursed"" meant that nothing has truly ever come along to upset his ways (which would free him in a way), I'm not sure.

Alma sees him as a nut that she must crack and displays frustration with others who would deny this (like Cyril) and jealousy towards those who have the potential to capture Woodcock's interest or take on that same task.  I think she wants to be the only one who can truly get under his skin and doesn't want to be just another in a long line of women who tried to, but failed to solve this riddle of a man.",7rfe1t

Is he really a shell of his former self or is this character growth? I see a genuine change after the vision of his mother, with a relapse after marriage.

It's interesting to ask the simple question of 'what does each character want?' throughout the movie. It's a power triangle of desires. Among Reynolds many wants/needs is his mother. Both women can be seen as his surrogate mother - Cyril providing the discipline, Alma providing the affection. In this sense, Alma can be read as the ghost of his mother, and is furthermore, visually framed alongside his vision of his ghost mother. 

Thanks for commenting. I don't mean to negate your take, in fact, I love that so many interpretations can exist. The reserved nature of the movie demands interpretations. So much is not said in the film and so much has stuck with me.

I've found that's been the case with There Will be Blood, The Master, and this film. PTA's got such a specific sense of humor and it's present even in his more dramatic works.
",7rfe1t
dtgiahq,"I think marketing might have been a serious problem with Phantom Thread. The box office hasn't been as high as people expected of a PTA film, and personally I believe that comes down to the trailer conveying ""married people bicker for the duration of what is probably a three hour movie"". 

If Day Lewis hadn't announced retirement prior to release, this brilliant work might have tanked.",7rfe1t

dswkodg,You’re right. Not sure why I thought it was that. ,7rfe1t
dszp5ax,"eh i actually wouldnt compare this to the big little lies relationship. its been a while since i binged that, but iirc that came off more as Celeste's character doing mental gymnastics to avoid confronting how terribly abusive the husband was by reminding herself of their good ol days, choosing to view certain sexual moments between each other as rough passionate sex rather than manipulative sexual violence and abuse, and thinking if she stays and pretends their life is good and this is a minor rough patch, things will get back to being perfect. which is a realistic and literal depiction of what an abusive relationship can be like and what women do actually experience. 

meanwhile, taking the relationship of phantom thread literally, Reynolds's choice to accept Alma's poison and his enjoyment of playing the sick role is far more like Reynold's having a factitious disorder or Munchausen's syndrome and Alma's his proxy, willing to give him poison because she loves it when hes sick too. still an abusive relationship by definition but not at all a common experience that's meant to be a realistic depiction or taken literally. it doesnt serve to show the complexity of an abusive relationship between a married couple and how tough it is for the abused to leave.

i agree though that when taken figuratively, Reynolds and Alma's relationship represents the quirks and subversions of romantic norms and gender norms required for a man and woman to make their relationship work out. and ofc the tenderness and love that a romantic partner treats you with whenever you're vulnerable. it's a beautifully told story.",7rfe1t
dsz3och,"You really nailed why I loved the film. The first watch plays with the viewer who is viewing a relationship sans the context of why they are together.

They're odd, but what strong and loving couple doesn't have something unique to them that others might find repulsive? ",7rfe1t
dt5m108,"I definitely agree with your take on this. I have a question though. I'm romantically autistic, I was wondering if this kind of relationship is par for the course or is it toxic? Or this only works in movies?",7rfe1t
dtkn8g2,"Their relationship reminded me so much of a girl who I used to date. Separately we were nice, open, meek, and cool. Together we were the absolute opposites of that. Something about each other brought out the worst in both of us, to the point where we loved it. It was never anything physically abusive, but it was a constant pressing of each other's buttons.

It was toxic, and we recognized it, but it was fun. In the end we got to a point where neither of us could take it anymore and went our own ways. We still keep in contact for whatever reason, and I still consider her a good friend but romantically she's toxic as all hell.",7rfe1t

I wanted to give it 3.5 stars (3 meaning 'I liked it,' and 4 meaning 'I loved it'), because while it was masterfully made, there's no way I'll ever watch it again or suggest it to any friends... but then I remembered that I saw Jumanji 2 the day before and also gave it a 3.5 and felt weird about rating them similarly when this movie is obviously better in every single way except not actually being enjoyable.",7rfe1t

I thought her natural accent emerged much stronger in the asparagus scene than during the rest of the movie. It kinda took me out of what should've been one of the defining scenes of the movie. But overall her performance was still wonderful.

I guess I just don't understand what the denouement added to the movie that hadn't already been conveyed/implied by the reveal. In *The Master*, it served to underscore Dodd's point: all men have masters, and Freddie's is instinct/women/sex (or, more specifically, oedipal urges). 

Additionally, *The Master* has a more subtle climax. There's less to undercut by dragging the movie past Freddie's motorcycle departure. In *Phantom Thread*, which builds throughout the movie towards a reveal which in my mind resolves most of the major questions/themes of the film, every additional minute actually lessens the mysteriousness for me and borders on superfluity. I'd rather the movie end with Dr. Hardy's arrival at the house and work out for myself Alma's final monologue as I leave the theater.",7rfe1t

And she sees these rules and this prison he lives in and has created for himself and others, and wants to get him out.

I'd love to hear your take, but I don't see much character growth from Reynolds.

He's not himself when he proposes, so he falls back into his true self as the memory of the mushroom experience fades.



I'm glad you mentioned stockholm syndrome; I feel this is the primary motivation for Reynolds' willingness in the end.

Also in the high-end fashion industry it's not uncommon for a designer to be hired/retained to make and maintain person's whole wardrobe and the relationship more akin to a meseum's relationship to an artist whose work they display(hence the dress stealing scene because she was disgracing the art wearing it while getting blackout drunk).",7rfe1t

I also thought her poisoning him ties with the whole theme of near-death. ""There's an air of quiet death in this house."" or DDL monologue about the dead watching over the living.

This is why he was so upset when Alma sent Cyril and everyone away for the night. He was no longer in control and the affection was not on his terms. 

And this, I think, ties in to why he let himself get poisoned. He is aware that the only time he feels affectionate is when he can't work. Normally the only time he can't work is when he has fully exhausted himself, but that doesn't come around often. By allowing Alma to poison him, he is forcing himself to give up work and to indulge in his affectionate side. 

The more I think about it, the more his relationship with Alma makes sense. It's supremely unorthodox, but he knows it's the only way to allow himself a romantic relationship.",7rfe1t

In a way this is his plottiest film ever considering the mid-point kick, where you're then waiting for the other shoe to drop, followed by the ultimate revelations which are actually satisfying.  For me, many of his films have this alienating effect on the first viewing where you're hoping it's going to come together into something satisfying and then just doesn't.  On rewatch I come to love them, but I'm always surprised and left empty by the first viewing.  Phantom Thread was an exception.

Like The Master, what seems to be overlong on a first viewing reveals itself as not only incredibly economical and fluid but also missing some things that ought to be there, adding to its sense of mystery.",7rfe1t

dt0mtlx,"Here's the thing: his ""style"" in Phantom Thread is actually different from his first three films, which are the two films above that I mentioned as well as *Hard Eight*. These more closely resemble the films of Scorsese, specifically the movie Goodfellas. This more refined style he's adopted began with the film *Punch-Drunk Love* and has continued since then. So if his later style is what you really like then I would watch *There Will Be Blood*, *The Master*, and *Punch Drunk Love*. Again I'm a PTA stan so I'd say just watch all his films because he's only made like 8. Id even recommend watching in release order to watch his style grow.",7rfe1t
dsx1js7,"Those sinister undertones are there, but mainly because Woodcock is an extremely controlling and overly sensitive man. Alma, however, doesn't allow herself to be intimidated by him, and therefore removes him of his bite, softening him into something more.

I, however, didn't feel like the film was stuck between a period romance and psychological study. I thought it deftly explored the psychological landscape of these lovers in this specific period. I think that the contrast between what is refined (fashion) and what is repulsive (poison) is what makes the film so effective.",7rfe1t
dsz3v22,"Well, it definitely plays like a cold drama at first, but that's because we spend a lot of time observing the relationship without the actual context of why they are together.

I was paying attention to the music very close. The sister isn't really flushed out but I got the impression that Daniel day Lewis was the favorite kid and his mom promoted a toxic view on the value of women. I viewed the sister being instilled with the view DDL expressed when talking about the helper who died alone because supposedly she was ugly. She also could have viewed herself as cursed since she touches wedding dresses so often. The sister seems to still like the wife even when DDL says she is ruining him and the home. I can't wait to watch it again, I think the sister is the key to a lot of the meaning. I bet there are more layers, since it is a PTA film.

It's really a character study about a particular character type, but it does show how this particular character type affects and is affected by society at large, and then how when you put another layer of gender, how it starts to affect gender relations and inequalities. He didn't treat women they way he because he ""hates women"" or thinks they are naturally dumber or something than men.

Inherent Vice was reviewed poorly and seemed to be a film of mostly interior shots that could be enjoyed almost as much on the small screen. It took 8 million domestic.

The Master was reviewed well, but your average viewer didn't see Philip Seymour Hoffman as one of the world's greatest actors until that performance, and his death. It took 16 million domestic.

There Will Be Blood was a grand scale visual Western of sorts, starring Daniel Day Lewis hot off of Gangs of New York and perceived as the greatest actor of his generation. It took 40 million domestic.

On the surface, Phantom Thread is a movie about a fashion designer in a shitty marriage. It has the Day Lewis built in audience, but without his GoNY hype fresh in the minds of the general audience.

He falls in love with her bc she stumbles and just smiles, sth Reynolds couldn't do. He is highly obsessive and this means, that there is an underlying fear of death in his mind. With those near-death experiences, Alma tries to cure (not poison) him, because she understands, that he is in fact weak (and says that).

I don't wanna go too much into detail, bc english isn't my mother tongue, but I think the movie is about relationships today, where everyone is trying to optimize himself and his surroundings. Death and failure are tabooed and this makes us think we have an eternity and billions of choices. We don't. We have to allow OTHER people to be DIFFERENT from us, we have to let go.
I know this sounds a little bit crude and incoherent, but I think, it's the right approach.

dsxrx4d,"I agree it seemed that way with Cyril, but almost in a way that she was playing the game too. She's very standoffish in some scenes towards Alma, and then later seemingly caring towards her. And the scene about her ""running through him"" and that he would be the one on the ground all come together to why she's so unpredictable and refreshing in the movie.  I appreciate the long response!",7rfe1t
dt2l3e0,I agree not everything must be done with subtlety. I'm saying that in this case it was so obvious that I was taken out of the movie by the realization that the director or editor was trying to manipulate a response from me...rather than me feeling the response they desired I feel.  ,7rfe1t
dsxgm2z,Thanks. Do you mind telling me what theater chain you watched it at? I saw mine at a Regal Cinema and I'm just trying to figure out if the distributor sent out different versions of the film to different chains. ,7rfe1t
dt0ue23,Noted. I think I’ll go with watching in release order,7rfe1t

dtp0yfa,"Yeah, that is some psycho weird stuff and takes some serious balls as a woman to advertise on their Twitter. That is a sure way of coming off as a crazy woman which I know many women don't like to be labelled as.

htf2ojl,"I just watched this movie 4 years later and always come to Reddit discussions after movies, but if you still care the blue is from the scene that he is first fitting her and holds up the blue and says it’s too serious but that was her vibe the whole time and what she wanted. So this flash forward of hers is depicting the dress she actually wanted",7rfe1t
dt68hz5,"Thanks for that.  I still need to see those first three and A Ghost Story, but I do agree that this year gave us some pretty great films.  Unfortunately, I didn't care much for Baby Driver and Logan fell off for me around the halfway point.  However, I can still respect what they were trying to do.

To any list of 2017's best, I'd also like to add Blade Runner 2049 and Paddington 2. 2049 is my current favorite of the year.",7rfe1t

dtebdw5,"Ugh, I know how you feel. During the credits I heard an elderly woman say, ""that wasn't what I expected, very disappointing."" 

That doesn't even make sense! What *were* you expecting, lady? Did you look up the director? No, because if you did, you would've seen that his work is consistently unique and abrasive to general audiences; films you obviously wouldn't enjoy. I guess she wasn't listening when DDL said ""expectations and assumptions are the cause of all heartache;"" a line in the movie you just fucking watched and are now criticizing based on unfounded expectations and assumptions. It screams it's themes in the audience's face, beautifully tying in with the ending and wrapping it up all nice, and you still didn't get it! It was literally trying to subvert your expectations, you stupid bitch. How the fuck is that ""disappointing?!"" I legitimately couldn't hold it in and burst out laughing when she said it. The irony could not have been more palpable. Some people are just scared of weird movies, and I will never understand it.

But honestly, I'm totally okay with marketing weird movies as something more accessible if it gets these old people to buy tickets to something they wouldn't see otherwise. Keep giving PTA money so he can keep making weird awesome shit.",7rfe1t

dt2q7zv,"A lot of PTA's films can be *really* long and deliberate with their pacing, which might come off as slow/boring if you aren't in the right mindset. I think going in order is a good strategy, just don't burn yourself out by trying to watch them all in a week or something. ",7rfe1t

dtp345x,"Whether a woman acts good or evil, it's the agency, creativity, or non-traditionally feminine qualities that the character displays that gets people to appreciate a movie's portrayal of women.  Both Alma and Cyril are very in control of everything they do.  They don't back down on anything.  For that and other reasons, morality aside, people like the way PTA wrote the characters.

It's not really about wanting to BE the characters, who are both quite mean, as we see.",7rfe1t

duxolnf,"Magnolia: 

>in the 1999 film Magnolia Tom Cruise plays a narcissistic misogynist PUA who eventually breaks down when he realises what a terribly sad man he is.

Also:

>Claims for Reynolds as an archetype of toxic masculinity are, he thinks, “a bit thin. He’s just your standard-issue self-absorbed, spoiled-baby fashion designer in Fitzrovia in 1955. He’s not ripping his shirt off and doing jello shots.”

Sure baby PTA, sure.

Because the same ""The Guardian"" published:

>Ravenous, even destructively toxic masculinity is hardly a new theme in Anderson’s oeuvre. Magnolia tackled it head-on via Tom Cruise’s performance as male-empowerment motivational speaker Frank TJ Mackey, a misogynist with a brittle alpha veneer and braying mantra of “respect the cock”. There Will Be Blood’s ruthless, loveless oil prospector Daniel Plainview craved possession of land and human souls in roughly equal measure; The Master gave us two spiritually poisoned men, each shaped and gnarled by dysfunctional relations with women, whose power struggle built into a crippled romance of egos.

>The Twisted Fascination of ‘Phantom Thread’: If This Isn’t Toxic Masculinity, What Is? Coming after “There Will Be Blood” and “The Master,” “Phantom Thread” is the third film Anderson has made that centers on a domineering patriarchal ego-stoked power figure who squeezes the juice out of the person closest to him",7rfe1t
dujt8hs,¿? What do you think this movie is about? PTA has pet subjects. He was trashing PUAs (Magnolia)  when they were not even in the mainstream discourse. ,7rfe1t

dtfdrca,"Pacing is most certainly the result of storytelling and editing and the decisions around the story told and how it was portrayed were definitely deliberate. The pace of a movie is the speed at which plot is revealed to the audience. Since this was a movie with very limited plot lines the result was that the story--where ultimately quite little occurs over the 2hrs--felt, in my opinion, quite drawn out, limited, and ultimately unsatisfying. The acting was good, but the characters themselves were not altogether that compelling. I didn’t find myself “rooting” for or against anyone in any discernible way and I didn’t really find myself caring what happened to the characters. There have been plenty of character driven movies this year (The Darkest Hour, Ladybird, Three Billboards, to name a few), which all made me invest in the outcomes or resolutions for the characters that they revolved around. This one didn’t do it for me.",7rfe1t
