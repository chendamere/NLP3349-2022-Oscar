He died fighting and even though it wasn't enough, it shows just how genuine/good his character was.

dls6fds,"The tension building up when they visit the oil rig followed by the shootout... holy shit.

Really good film overall. Loving all of Taylor Sheridan's work so far. He really nails the modern western feel, even when he is trying something different - like a thriller set in the Winds.

The dialogue was a little over the top with the whole ""we are in wyoming"" thing but it didnt really bother me.

Fantastic acting all around.           ",6ueskb
dls6lp9,"Really solid crime story here. Very smartly written; all the performances were great. Especially Elizabeth Olsen. Probably her best performance since *Martha Marcy May Marlene*. 

Taylor Sheridan has written three great movies and this was a very strong directorial debut. I can't wait to see what's next for him, because thus far he's been killing it. 

I'm really glad they didn't go the serial killer route. It was just a terrible set of circumstances and some downright evil decisions made by some drunk guys. Nothing premeditated, no connection to the death of Jeremy Renner's daughter, no super creepy killer who stalks the police, just a really sad and fucked up situation.",6ueskb
dlsvpbe,"I absolutely love the way he handled the reveal of what actually happened to Matt and Natalie.

Cutting away from Jane knocking at the door to go to the flashback, where you see the awful things that happened within those sleeping quarters.  The tension building up as you watch that flashback and know that Jane is walking right into a trap, and then cutting back to the present where you're extremely on edge because you know something awful is about to happen.

That whole sequence was perfect.   ",6ueskb

dlsef49,"I actually went to watch this yesterday(& Logan Lucky tonight) and man... this was a solid flick.  It felt like part-thriller & part-drama with a few dark moments here and there but strong acting, dialogue and overall storytelling.  



- The line that hit me the most was Cory's ""Steer from the pain"" speech.  Even though I've never experienced the pain of loss myself, that talk he gave to Natalie's father hit me hard and I started to tear up right in the middle of that scene.  


- Renner and Olsen did really well.  She really sold it as the rookie agent and Renner played the hell out of the silent, level-headed, badass game-hunter.


- A very satisfying conclusion seeing those assholes getting snuffed by Cory and helping find justice and answers for Natalie, even if it meant sacrificing him finding closure for Emily.


It's sad to see the turnout was so low and that only two theaters(not just in my city but my whole area) were playing this film.  This is definitely worth a viewing and Taylor Sheridan deserves more work.. Very well made.",6ueskb
dlsbhzd,"Wasn't really sure what to expect from Sheridan's directorial debut but this movie really blew me away. The screenplay was top notch as usual and he was able to build some great tension during the action scenes and even during simple conversations. The cinematography is also very beautiful with a lot of landscape shots. 

This is a career best performance from Elizabeth Olsen and one of Jeremy Renner's best over the last few years. 

I also appreciated how some of the darker aspects of this situation weren't shied away from and the character's actions did have consequences. Since this is the last movie in his unofficial western trilogy, Sheridan is going out on a very high note. 

I still can't believe the cop from Sons of Anarchy is directing movies now. ",6ueskb
dlsd8a2,"All I have to say is wow. I'm going to be recommending this movie to a lot of people. Fantastic performances from Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olson, Graham Greene was great as always, and while I always love Gil Birmingham he went above and beyond. His scenes were very emotional and I really felt his pain.

The cinematography was phenomenal as well. I can't say enough good things about this movie.",6ueskb
dltduvv,"I don't think I've ever experienced tension as I did in the climax of this movie. I just clenched my chest with my fingers harder and harder, and couldn't let go. 

I love the kind of modern western theme Sheridan went for in his last two movies, and I love how he uses political and social climate in the US as a setting for the movies, as reasons for the conflict. The atmosphere and structure/pacing seem to be his strongest abilities.

Also, holy shit, Olsen and Renner. Between this mediocre blockbuster and that mediocre blockbuster, I forgot these people can act. They just blew me away with their performances (especially Renner).

A stunning achievement of a debut.",6ueskb
dlu0uhn,"Man, there was some cool editing in this movie!! I love when Cory stomping on the guy's face outside the trailer cuts into Jane kicking in the door. I also really loved the first person perspective after she was maced.

I also really loved the [tension building between the federal agents and the workers. All hell broke loose once Jane was shot through the door and flew back, it was like an erupting volcano](#spoiler)

dls6ot1,How the fuck is this movie not getting a bigger release? Sicario was an amazing film and Hell or High Water was nominated for Best Picture. The third film of this brilliant trilogy is getting a very slow limited release. This film is hopefully going to get a buzz like Hell or High Water. I don't get why studios would bury this film in the dreck of summer rather than in fall. This movie is almost guaranteed a Screenwriting nomination.,6ueskb

dlwccgn,"I loved this film. My take: if you were looking for a mystery/thriller film, you probably ended up disappointed, as it was a pretty straight forward story that lacked intensity, save for a scene or two. However, I thought the film did an incredible job of using a run of the mill double homicide as a vehicle to transport its central themes: the static and trapped life on a Native American Reservation and how suffering is the best way to acknowledge loss. Every character touched my the central conflict in the story showed these themes in some way, but you really just needed to see the final scene to get the essence of the film. 

[When Jeremy Renner turns to the father and says ""I'm going nowhere"" or something to that affect he really got at the crux of the film: the people on this reservation are stuck, both in their traditions, lack of social mobility, and physical distance from the outside world. I thought it was especially telling how the camera panned behind them afterwards, and the way the swing set was positioned around the two of them, it looked like they were in a teepee overlooking the desolate landscape](#spoiler) Really impressive film, did an amazing job portraying its central themes, thoroughly enjoyed it. Interested to hear if others found it as powerful.",6ueskb

dlt6ppr,Gil Birmingham was fantastic in his smaller role. I'm starting to love this guy. I didn't really know him before Hell or Highwater (where he was hilarious). Started watching House of Cards last week and I was pleased to see him in season two. Then he makes me weep like a baby at the end of Wind River. Anyone have any recommendations for projects he's in?,6ueskb
dlt8nck,"Absolutely loved it. Favorite movie of the year. Renner's ex-wife was a little too stoic for her part, but loved everyone else. Wasn't expecting Bernthal's character to actually be a good guy, but as soon as the other guys came back it was pretty obvious what was going to happen to her. He sure put up a hell of a fight though. Renner nailed his part too . I would say all of Sheridan's 3 movies are probably my favorites of the years they came out. ",6ueskb
dm2ug6c,"My favorite was Graham Greene quietly stealing every scene he was in.

Actually, can we just take a moment to appreciate all the excellent Native actors in this? Gil Birmingham, obviously, and Martin Sensmeier and Kelsey Chow gave really powerful performances.",6ueskb
dlv7n36,"I mostly enjoyed the film quite a bit. It was certainly thrilling in the parts where it was supposed to be but . . .

I had a big problem with how often Renner's backstory came up. It seemed like they were pounding us in the face with it when I felt it would have been much more effective had it been elusive. Less is more here.

Instead, among other moments, I got to roll my eyes in scenes like when the drug addict brother was arrested. ""I wanna fight the whole world! Do you have any idea what that's like?"" with Renner's character responding ""Yeah . . . I do. But I'd rather fight the feeling.""

Even Renner's ex-wife just felt like a stereotype of a begrudged widow who stands in the doorway always reminding Renner ""this won't solve what you're looking for.""

Those moments were just too on the nose. Too hammy and could have used some paring down. 

THAT SAID, the rest of it was well done. I enjoyed the Graham Greene character and Elizabeth Olsen. The whole backdrop of this Native reservation withering away was quite enthralling. The shootouts were exhilarating. And the rape scene . . . was terrifying.

Would certainly recommend this to friends of mine.",6ueskb
dn951sy,"Just saw this movie yesterday. I liked this movie a lot. While it wasn’t perfect for a few reasons, I thought it was a great film. However, there was one thing that really bothered me about the movie. I really think they made a big mistake in regard to casting. I'll just come out and say it. Renner's role should have been played by a Native American. And not simply for the sake of the lost opportunity for representation, but more importantly because the narrative suffered a bit because of it.

For example, as presented in the movie, the subplot where [Renner's character and the father of the murdered girl grapple with the loss of their children is extremely powerful. However, if Renner's character was casted as a Native American, the scene would have taken on a more meaningful and darker subtext. Instead of the two men just bonding over the loss of their daughters, it would have been two men, grappling with the reality that their community and culture is deteriorating, with the rape and murder of their child only playing a part of that grim reality. And now picture these two men staring off in the distance while the movie fades to black. ](#spoiler)

Another scene that would have worked so much better was the scene where [Renner scolds the brother in the back of the cop car and lays out the options he eschewed in favor of living his life as a junkie. The scene is played relatively straight with Renner showing a measure of sympathy for the brother. But were the character a Native American, there would be a deeper subtext and a more interesting dynamic between the two characters. From one older cynical Native American to another younger jaded Native American, the conversation becomes much more meaningful, and can go in many different directions.] (#spoiler)

In the film, they had a brief window of opportunity to add depth to the scene, and even add more thematic depth to the plot as a whole, when [the brother calls out Renner's character for coming from outside the community. ] (#spoiler) Unfortunately they chose not to flesh that theme out more, and it remained one of the few, if not the only allusion to the characters’ background.

Every scene I imagine with a Native American Actor is far more powerful in my head. [Even the speech Renner gives at the end to Olsen’s character about surviving](#spoiler), would have taken on a darker subtext. Every time Renner referred to “his family’s struggles” it would remind me of how unnecessary the casting was. Instead of having Renner defer his struggles to “his family’s” struggles, they could simply be his struggles. 

The most frustrating part about the casting decision, is that it felt unnecessary. If they had used Renners’ character to add depth to the role and plot, the movie would have been fine. But as written, the role didn’t lend itself to a non-Native American character, and would have suited a Native American actor more cleanly. It would have been at least a little better, albeit controversial and hard to pass off, to have the character played by Renner be Native American. At times, it can feel that Hollywood has trouble believing that white audience members can empathize with non-white actors. However, it is more likely that there just aren't enough big name Native American Actors they can put on the playbill. It is also possible, they just couldn't find a Native American Actor to audition for the part that was up to snuff. Whatever the case, I feel like they really missed an opportunity to take this movie to the next level simply for the sake of making a few extra dollars in the box office.

dndujb2,"As soon as the brother mentioned the ""cracker boyfriend"" I was guessing who they had casted to be the murderer. I didn't look up the cast list beforehand so when we see inside the trailer and it's Jon Bernthal I was like, yep there we go. But I was bummed because I LOVE Bernthal and didn't want him to be the killer.

Well, my happiness that he wasn't the killer did. Not. Last. God, what a hard scene to watch. ",6ueskb
dlv8k8t,"I liked it right up until the confrontation with the oil rig security guys. I don't understand what exactly their plan was. Did they really think that they could kill 5 police officers from multiple jurisdictions and an FBI agent and that would be the end of it? Or that it would make this less bad for them somehow? I get that people don't always think clearly when they are under stress, but their actions made no sense to me. I think it would have been better if they acted suspicious but non threateningly until the guy in the trailer shoots Banner, then all hell breaks loose. ",6ueskb

dlse4sv,"Taylor Sheridan has quickly become someone that I would watch anything that he writes and/or directs in the future from now on, regardless of what the story is about. The man is incredibly talented. 

Incredible character driven film and I hope the studio doesn't screw up the release of this film to wider audiences. ",6ueskb
dlthrtc,"I loved the film. I'll admit there were some moments that felt a little bit off, likely due to Sheridan's first time in the director's chair (perhaps that's unfair but it's the impression I got). But they didn't drag down the movie as a whole. Overall a very engaging thriller. And to Sheridan's credit, he nails it when it matters most. The tension leading up to the finale was just incredible. And learning the truth about what happened was heartbreaking. Renner absolutely kills it in this movie. Olsen too. And they're surrounded by a fantastic supporting cast. I can't wait to see what Sheridan does next. This, Sicario, and Hell or High Water are among my favorite films of the past several years. ",6ueskb
dnqeuyc,This movie is so golden because people are generally used to garbage CGI Hollywood lights and magic movies. This is a film that decides to not use trashy effects and instead real acting from actors and actresses who not only know how to present themselves on a visual medium but a mental medium as well. Its so nice and refreshing because we have something that holds ambiguity and real meaning not explosions on a feel good level. ,6ueskb

dq894o6,"Just watched the movie this evening, and it may not be the tightest movie in a narrative sense, but it establishes its atmosphere fairly well.

Some performances of the Natives seem a little too on-the-nose in describing the issues they face. While others (notably the older men) have better dialogue and act logically within the narrative.

I really the tribal police captain, because he had a bit of a small story arc with how I perceived him. At the beginning, I thought he was a ""hump"" that was going to be an obstacle for the main characters trying to solve the murder. I thought he doesn't want to mess with the status quo, and he doesn't care.

But then my perception of him starts changing, because you see that he is quietly jaded. He's understaffed, and overmatched, and he's seen too much failure in his line of work throughout all of these years, and he's just become numb to it even though he still cares inside.

He immediately sees the young FBI detective and thinks that he's knows this is going to end the same way as all the other times. He tries to stop Elizabeth Olsen from pushing the locals too hard, not because he doesn't like the outsider pushing, but he knows that she doesn't understand just how rough a condition the locals are in.

They make some progress, and he's still apprehensive about the effort. And then you begin to see him have hope that they could get a decent lead towards solving this case.

And by the end, he's a believer in the two partners he's got, and he went out of his way to get a couple more State Troopers because he thinks that they are close to nailing it. He ends up being fully awake and being a cop with fight in him near the end. I really liked that guy's performance.",6ueskb

Sometimes these crime/dramas get overly complicated but Sheridan kept it simple which I loved. I really recommend this one.

I tend to stay away from the silly CGI filled Hollywood blockbusters anyway so this films makes it feel like it's made just for me. By the sounds of it a few other people here also liked that it's not another big CGI blockbuster. Just actors, landscape and acting.",6ueskb

That scene towards in the end when Jane is in the hospital and feels the pain and says she ran 6 miles in the snow was powerful and sad at the same time.

Also, what was their plan? Kill all the cops and hope no-one notices they murdered a federal agent, the BIA cops and sheriffs? I buy that these guys aren't criminal masterminds, but I feel like the shootout would have made more sense as a spontaneous panicked thing rather than being a planned ambush.](#spoiler)

The action itself was great, and the dialogue and scene setting was also really good.

There was substantially more nuance, drama, and emotional subtext than in his other films. This is definitely a writer's film. There is action, but the richness is in the characters and how they deal with trauma. What really stood out to me was the way Cory engaged other characters by using his trauma as a way to connect with them. I also think Olsen was fantastic. She is has been great over the last few years. I wish there was more Bernthal, such a fantastic actor. He needs more lead roles. ",6ueskb

When the main crew had guns out and pointed towards the group who did it at first, they slowly came to a peaceful agreement when the FBI woman put her weapon in it's holster. When everyone did it but the last guy, she approached him slowly and said ""Holster the gun or you're under arrest"" to which he replied with something along the lines of ""Didn't you see it?""

As much I like flashy shootouts like say what they have in John Wick, I also really like short, brutal realistic depictions of how a real gunfight would likely play out.

I get that hicks love guns, but I can’t understand how it would make financial sense to employ such a big security team out in the middle of nowhere.

The cast's acting excellent all around. Jeremy Renner gives one of the best performances of his career, and his relationship with Elizabeth Olsen's character is so refreshingly pure and...kind. The music and cinematography are both hauntingly beautiful. The plot is simple, but because of its simplicity, I had the room to feel every drama, conflict and character's emotion in every step of the story's progression. I stayed in my seat for a long time after the credits rolled in, and I left the cinema in awe. Brilliant brilliant film!",6ueskb

I only have two...issues? nitpicks?...with this movie. First, I thought that there would be a little more involvement of Renner's family in the movie, based on how much time we spend with them right off the bat. But somewhere along the way Renner's family basically disappears from the movie except for [his dead daughter](#spoiler)

Second, and this is the tiniest of nitpicks to have with this movie, and I can't believe I ever would have said this, but did we really need the shot of Elizabeth Olson's ass when she's getting dressed in the winter clothing? Don't get me wrong, she's got a nice ass, but with the tone of the rest of the movie and how serious and depressing it is, it felt really awkward and out of place for that five second shot of her ass and thong.",6ueskb
dowqhqe,"I really liked this movie. It wasn't perfect, but was one of the more enjoyable I've seen this year. Even with some flaws I found myself engaged and into it the whole time. I didn't know til this thread this guy wrote Sicario and Hell or High Water. He's building quite the writing resume, I'll have to be on the lookout for his next work. 

The star of the movie to me was the reservation. It was really interesting seeing the desolation and isolation and vastness and desperation of it.  It was cool getting to see a world that isn't used very often and one most people will never see.  I do wish there had been more. The reservation life fascinated me. But outside of the few homes and the junkie trailer and the drill site, we didn't get much else. I wish it had explored a little more of the circumstances of these people and gave us a larger taste. They talked about the life there but didn't show a whole lot of it. 

I thought Jeremy Renner was really good. One of his best performances I think. I especially liked his scene telling Olsen about his daughter. That got me choked up. Olsen was pretty good, nothing spectacular, but not bad at all. I didn't know Jon Bernthal was in the movie and at first when he opened the door I thought he was the rapist/killer and was thinking, of course, this guy plays such a great asshole. Turns out he wasn't the asshole after all.

A few things I wasn't a fan of.  Nitpicky, but I really didn't like the conversation between Renner and the brother in the cop truck. The conversation content was alright but it felt out of place and unrealistic in that situation. A little contrived.  I thought the last act was too rushed. It needed more time to breathe. The tension was building and then it exploded quickly and was over.  It also was a little chaotic. Why are cops just walking along with armed workers when they are there to investigate a rape/murder. Seemed odd to me. I can't imagine too many officers being comfortable going to question somebody with a guy with a loaded shotgun right next to them. Then the door scene got tense and they switched to the flashback. I don't know how I would have done it better but I would have liked the flashback scene and the door scene without interrupting the tension building in the door scene.  And the flashback was off to me. I maybe would have liked that to breathe a little more and build up and last longer. Also, I don't necessarily *want* more assault but the coroner's story didn't really match up with the scene. He described multiple people or multiple occasions and we didn't get that. Just seemed inconsistent. Next, I didn't understand how Renner knew what was about to happen, and I guess he radioed the cop and the cop yelled to get away from the door. Then a second later the shotgun goes off. How did he know the exact second to warn? Did the cop have a hunch? Why let her go to the door in the first place? Maybe I missed something. Then the shootout has like 40 point blank shots going off but they all seem to be alive for a while like they were only shooting each others legs of something, it felt off. The whole scene was a little clumsy. Not bad but could have been more thought out and methodical. I still don't know how Renner knew what happened and knew which guy it was and all that at the end. Maybe I missed something again. And the scene where he lets the guy run needed more gravity to it. In principle I liked it, but he ran like 50 yards and collapsed. Could have had a lot more weight to it and didn't leave me as satisfied as I wanted to be with it. Alsonwhat happened to Matt? Was he the second body they found? Did they not identify it before they went looking  for him? That whole thing left me confused. And I wish there had been more resolution. Did all the cops die? His friend cop got killed and we just see him hanging out with Olsen. What about his kid, what about his wife. I just think it needed like 20-30 more minutes in the last act to flesh it all out properly. 

All that said I did like it. I'll watch it again and recommend it for sure.",6ueskb
dlsqx66,"Oh my god I loved this movie.

I should also say this is the most ""Wyoming"" thing I've ever seen, and you really get the feeling that at least some research was done on what life is actually like there. The big, empty, frozen landscapes were beautifully shot, and the bits and pieces of dialogue attached to the various towns in middle and western Wyoming felt realistically spoken (the bemoaning of Jackson Hole's housing prices is a good example of this).

This felt like it was a tighter, more personal story than Sicario's. Man I really just adore this movie.",6ueskb

I felt that Sheridan's directing as a whole was quite bland and it was fairly obvious he was a new director. The lack of wide establishing shots and his coverage in dialogue scenes was disappointing (what stood out was that one scene early on where Renner was speaking to his father in law and it seemed like he was talking to himself because we had no cutaways or wider shots). 

When you compare this to the previous films written by Sheridan - *Hell Or High Water* and *Sicario*, where you had Mackenzie's keen awareness of performance and visceral action, and Villeneuve's lean, ruthless editing that escalated tension - Wind River ends up feeling like a great script in need of more interesting ways to frame or visualize it.",6ueskb

dlve30x,"My thoughts (posted this on another Wind River discussion before I saw this one, I promise I’m not spamming!).

Personally, I hated it.

I really thought it was predictable, cliche, pretentious shit. There’s literally no mystery, they make a guess right away and then the entire answer is told to us.

I’m typing this on the walk home from the theater so forgive me for any grammar issues!

There was no intelligent reveal with anything. The flashback was totally superfluous and took away all the tension. Renner’s character had literally zero arc and was always a step ahead and basically got what he wanted.

Elizabeth Olsen’s character, the cliched, pencil-pushing out of towner, didn’t contribute to a single thing. She complains that the Coroner won’t rule it a murder so she can’t call in back-up. Then after a shootout where she kills a guy she still doesn’t call in back-up.

It felt totally contrived that all the guys would have the will to rape and murder and even more cover the entire thing up, giving their life to protect their drunk friend.

Jeremy Renner chewed the scenery and spent most of the time (besides constantly succeeding) spouting off pseudo-intellectual philosophy.

They kept repeating that the air would kill you if you breathe it in and then, of course, that’s how the big bad guy had to die.

Jeremy Renner’s son was seemingly important to him and then totally forgotten for the last two thirds of the movie. Maybe he’s still waiting at Grandpa’s?

The final blurb about missing people not being reported on Native American reservations seemed somewhat irrelevant... Maybe it would have made more sense if they discovered a slough of unreported missing people who are all part of one large conspiracy?

And the bad guy’s acting at the very end was *so* over the top and hammy.

The landscape is supposed to be the ‘enemy’ overarching throughout the entire film, but it never feels that overwhelming. And it definitely should, it’s basically the big-bad’s entire motive. Movies like Insomnia, for instance, did a great job of making the environment a major cause of anxiety within the characters and within the audience.

I think that a big issue was they never seemed to be able to choose who the main character was. I strongly think that it should have been totally about Elizabeth Olsen, and Renner’s tracker character should have been lurking mysteriously in the background. Maybe at one point she suspects him? Maybe he should have been dismissive of her initially to but then he comes around to being on her side? I don’t know, those are just random ideas off the top of my head as I’m walking home.

All together, I can say I was quite disappointed. It started pretty well IMO, but quickly devolved into a TV melodrama that was laughably bad at some points.

I’m open to discussion. Those are just my thoughts.",6ueskb

Of the three that I am referencing (Sicario, Hell or High Water, and Wind River), I have to say that I enjoyed River the most. Renner and Olson had great chemistry on screen, I really felt for their characters. I also appreciated the bite size moments of lightheartedness in this film, it helped to alleviate the otherwise somber tone. As everyone else is saying, I LOVED when they were all walking towards the oil rig and they found themselves in a standoff.

dmypgzq,"A solid B- from me, where Sicario is a solid A and Hell or High Water is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It just didn't soar to those heights, and I found it a bit tonally odd.  For example - we are introduced to his son, and sweet, nostalgic music plays.  Then, we never see his son for the rest of the film, and the music is all that creeping Nick Cave (who I love but I found the use of him a little in-your-face). Those emotional roots to his son were never revisited, when they were the establishing note of his character.  I know they shifted the focus to his situation with his daughter, but I still thought wanted some tonal resonance towards the end.  Another thing is I didn't really buy Elizabeth Olsen's character - she was very much just a fish outta water cop archetype, and I didn't really know or buy much about her character outside of that.  

And here's where my lefty political roots are showing, so please don't eviscerate me all SJWy - I don't see any reason why, short of the fact that Jeremy Renner is a stellar actor, that they couldn't have found an equally stellar native actor.  There was only one line in the whole movie which referenced him being non-native, and it was a relatively inconsequential line.  And I think the rape scene was just a touuuuch too gratuitous/sexualized.

All in all, I wouldn't say I left the theater angry, but given the heights the other two films by Taylor soared too, I was expecting something really magnificent, and while this had aspects I liked, this was pretty rote/formulaic all-in-all.

For the sake of the story being believable I choose to believe it was -45 that night and she was really out of shape or had a preexisting condition.

I did like how characters in the cold actually wore toques and balaclavas to keep their heads warm. Nothing kills my suspended disbelief more in a movie than it being -40 in Antarctica and the main characters are running around with their heads and necks completely exposed. That would get painful within seconds and body parts would be frozen within minutes.",6ueskb
dlsgk0t,"I think this is an above-average movie. But honestly? It kind of disappointed me. The dialogue in particular I thought was not up to snuff. None of the monologues felt earned. Every time Jeremy Renner or someone else would start on a monologue, all I would think about is how in real life no one would give a movie speech like that. So all those beautiful, flowery monologues really took me out of the movie. And then the acting I thought was too over-the-top in several scenes. The scene in the morgue where Elizabeth Olsen gets mad at the medical examiner is one standout, in particular. Another is the scene where they approached the house with the brothers and Jeremy Renner doesn't flinch even a little at all of the gunfire inside the building.

It just... All of it felt too over-the-top, and not realistic.

That said, Hell or High Water is one of my favorite movies of the decade.",6ueskb
dmkn12t,"I know this isn't a popular opinion on reddit, but in a movie that has to do so much with Native Americans, why did Jeremy Renner's character have to be a white guy?

dmkq5sv,"One of the few movies where I almost walked out of the theater during the climax.


I hated it. Just simply for the fact that the ending was fucking butchered by that out-of-place and out-of-reason gunfight. Like, holy FUCK. You'd have me believe that not one of those guys had the moral compass to stop the rape/murder? You'd have me believe that these guys were going to gun down a bunch of police officers and get away with it? Fucking retarded ending.
That being said, I did thoroughly enjoy the rest of the movie.... but that plot point and the resulting chaos was just.... horrible. 

Inexcusable for all of the 'realism' they'd built up throughout the rest of the movie.

To put into perspective, I live in Wyoming. Both the Wyoming town name drops and the poetic-justice, hardcore one-liners from Renner also annoyed me to no end. However, besides these two things and that horrible fucking climax, the movie got **so much right**. The solitude, the empty expanses, the openness. The cinematography was mint, the acting was fantastic, and the eerie atmosphere cut deep.

That being said, that climax really did ruin the movie for me.... which is surprising, considering that both Sicario and Hell or High Water were so damn good. ",6ueskb

dm11ykc,"i was downvoted on here for saying your lungs don't freeze in -20 F.. 

The good news is that our bodies are highly adapted to living in cold weather and there are many built-in protections that ensure that our lungs will not freeze from cold air. First, air is immediately heated up when it reaches your nose and mouth due to mucous. Ever wonder why you nose runs in cold weather? It is a defense mechanism that helps to heat up air before it reaches your lungs. Due to the importance of mucous and the amount produced, it is very important to stay well-hydrated when running in the cold.

Second, the lungs have a huge supply of blood. Being one of the most critical organs in the body, there are numerous blood vessels and capillaries that provide a constant supply of warm blood to the lungs that keeps them warm. Any cold air that makes it to the lungs is immediately warmed up and presents no threat of freezing. With that said, running in cold air does present some risks to certain people who have asthma.

Violence against native women on reservations is staggering but it's almost all domestic. Scapegoating white people for a very real problem is honestly pretty gross.

dlst1dd,"A good, if extremely flawed film.

Taylor Sheridan's direction is the primary issue here, as his style is somewhat choppy and there are even breaks in fluidity in some scenes. Further, he leaves some aspects of the narrative completely muddled and undeveloped, which is shocking considering the strength of his previous screenplays. Some of the plot was very poorly articulated, which is a misstep considering this is a murder mystery. Sheridan's dialogue, which is usually a strength borders on sermonizing here, which got to be a bit much by the films end. Given the topic being explored here, which is magnified in Canada, given that our number of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women total between 1500-2000 (there is actually a federal inquiry into it at the moment), I would have liked a little more insight into the issue on film rather than a quick throw in title at the end of the film. 

In terms of establishing a time and place, this was extremely well done, the atmosphere and setting was captured perfectly, capturing a certain realism that is then betrayed by little set-pieces like a shootout at a cabin filled with junkies that just has this ho-hum resolution and doesn't even garner any further attention, despite the fact that an FBI agent kills a man, when a central tenet of the plot is that the FBI isn't going to get involved beyond Olsen's character. You'd figure that would have changed very quickly given that scene. 

However, the flashback/shootout scene was absolutely incredible film-making. The buildup of dread and tension far outweighs the fact that it is technically a 10 minute cop-out to the questions that the film has been raising since the outset. 

Good directorial debut, but not even in the league of Sicario or Hell or High Water. In a lot of ways, this was a missed opportunity.",6ueskb

I imagine you'd be hard pressed to find someone not like this movie unless the only reason they don't like it is because they see everyone else like it and have to be contrarian.

The atmosphere is well-crafted and you feel put right into it, not just the cold weather but the cold life everyone there has to endure. The twists are masterfully set up and the little bit of action in it reminds me of the little bit of action in A History of Violence, where what actually happens is so short but the build up to it is so tense that it carries more weight to it.

The reveal of what actually happened and the immediate aftermath of that is very well done. I always like reveal scenes, even if you know what's coming, but especially if you don't really know EXACTLY what's coming, and the ambiguity leading up to then of whether Matt was good or bad set that up really well.

I assume they all died but who knows. Then the absurd premise of this guy running like 50 yrds before his lungs explode or something? Like people in ski resorts are dropping left and right or something. Renner and the father of the murdered girl had some good scenes with nice dialogue.

One thing that nagged me the whole way through and made me think I missed something is why didn't Cory or others just follow Natalie's tracks to where they started. She ran from the oil place for 6 miles apparently. Cory found her because he came across some tracks from her running. The tracks were so clear that he could tell she had been running due to the toes pointing down. Surely if she left some tracks she would have left tracks going a long way which in turn would have taken them to or close to the oil refinery (which I assume would be the only buildings for miles).

dmcv91m,"Another great Taylor Sheridan film.  I've made it a point to watch the films he's involved with since Sicario.  He has yet to disappoint.  This film, as with Hell or High Water really capture and update the archetypal themes of the old west without using self-parody or racist caricatures of European, Mexican, or American Indian people.  You can tell he didn't waste his life reading shit like The Atlantic and listening to NPR in his formative years.  His characters are honest, genuine, and believable.  

Sheridan really knows his stuff.  As with Sicario and Hell, his tightly wound stories offer an update to a culture common to those descendants of the pioneer spirit and what happened a century later to those who decided to stay behind.  

His female characters are also unique.  Like the arrogant, naive, and out of their range carpetbagger from 150 years ago, we see the cosmopolitan woman, full of hubris coming into a strange land and expecting all to kiss her ass.  In time she discovers her Dad was way too good to her and begins to see a reality far away from her soft institutionalized life.

I would think these characters are intentional for Sheridan.  The frontier of the nihilistic liberated woman's mind; high on her own 'civilized' ways, acting in bad faith with prejudice and mixing with the 'savages' is an important feature of his films. 

As with Sicario, the woman plays an important role for the audience.  The media culture is so far removed from such a large segment of American culture, that without these female leads, the contrast of cultures would likely be lost on the audience or exceedingly diminished.

I can't say enough about how Sheridan nails the ethic and values of rural America.  He is a kind of cultural anthropologist who produces quality work about the forgotten men and women who still live there.",6ueskb

It's because it's not a real studio, it's Weinstein. They don't specialize in large releases. A large release exposes the company to a lot of financial risk, and a hard boiled violent movie about an indian reservation murder just isn't going to play on 2,000+ screens. The last movie they put out on 2,000+ was Hateful Eight, and that did not go well for them financially. 

This movie has a low budget, targeted marketing, and a slow roll out. They're playing it safe, and doing an Oscar campaign later this year for sure, and hoping it can pick up steam like Hell or High Water, and transition into a successful home video run during Oscar season. It's out in August so it can be on VOD by November when awards season ramps up. ",6ueskb

4. It came out too early. Unless your movie is widely considered to be a genuine masterpiece and a top 3 film of the year, best picture nominations aren't likely.

The story about Lambert's wife/daughter was actually alluded to throughout the movie, starting from the scene in the beginning when he goes to pick up his son.

dqeqbzf,"Ok I'll go point by point. 

Security teams for a drilling operation (it seems like a fairly large area, they mention running the perimeter on snowmobiles. Point is, it's not like one building or on facility) would be armed the way you'd expect security guards to be armed. They each appear to have a handgun. They have two shotguns, the Mossberg 590 the rapist has in the trailer and the marinecote one the guy has in the field. If they have to monitor the perimeter, there's always the chance that they could run into a mountain lion or a bear or something else that might want to kill them and a handgun isn't much use in that situation, so that makes sense. Also I don't know if it's an oil drilling operation...I think they just say the drilling rigs...so it could be natural gas or anything.

[As for the full-auto firearm in the trailer](#spoiler)...that could have been a personal firearm or, if the security team is part of a large firm, they could have supplied them with one as a SHTF firearm. I believe there's one other rifle. In the wilds of Wyoming, that's not very much. [Frankly, the LEOs were underarmed for having no backup.](#spoiler) 

The reason for the team's presence is to prevent theft, vandalism, and likely to act as a maintenance crew during the winter when it's not operating. Same principal as a caretaker, only for a large multi-million dollar facility in the middle of nowhere, where they frequently get snowed in such that the roads are impassable. Six sounds reasonable. There's all kinds of machinery that would be stripped or stolen if not secured, not to mention portable equipment. Plus there are probably office trailers or buildings with computer equipment, files and such. And all the equipment that can be is likely barned up for the winter, which is why you don't see much. Also we only really see the trailer area of the drilling facility up close. 

Additionally, it doesn't seem like all the security team members are wearing body armor. [Actually, I only see it on chief rapist guy. The rest go down from torso shots, other than the one Jane gets in the legs and head. Again, the armor might have been a private item or it might have been supplied by the security company along with the assault weapon. Hell, you can buy a plate carrier and Level III armor for under $300 online right now. A little shitweasel like that is just the type to own an (illegal) machine gun and body armor thinking he's GI Joe working for a security outpost in the middle of nowhere.](#spoiler)

Again, the LEOs don't even have body armor [and are outmatched, other than Jane. Which was a little bit of a hole as we never see her put it on, and when she arrives, she's obviously not wearing it and explicitly states she's in a rental car, not a federal vehicle, which is why there's no cold weather gear. It's hard to swallow that she had her vest in the car but like no other luggage...though, in fairness, she could have had a bag in the car that we never see, just no cold weather gear. Since she's stationed near Vegas, and clearly came out quickly, that makes sense.](#spoiler) 

As far as the jurisdiction thing...the private security team says the property is on a lease from the reservation, meaning it's located within the reservation. 

In case you didn't realize, reservations are areas of land managed by a federally recognized Native American tribe under the US Bureau of Indian Affairs rather than the state governments of the United States in which they are physically located. Which means legally a county sheriff is no longer in their county once they enter a reservation. And since it's private property, without a warrant, the Tribal Police Chief's authority is technically limited as well. 

Certain felonies like murder fall under federal jurisdiction. That's the entire reason the FBI was called and responded. It has been the basis for a number of fish-out-of-water cop movies over the past few decades. ",6ueskb

The rookie FBI agent (female of course, it has to be a female) who is so dumb she doesn't check the weather forecast before going to a remote part of the country. She is there only to counterpoint Renner's skill as an outdoorsman. 

And while we're talking about stereotypes did you notice how the Indigenous women didn't look like any actual Indigenous women - instead they conformed closely to the classical ""Western"" idea of beauty. Go to any Indian reservation and you won't see anyone like this. Why do that? To manipulate the audience's emotions of course. To make us care more for them. Same as the bullshit story about the girl's lungs exploding from  the cold air. Instead of simple hypothermia, why? Because it sounds much more dramatic, that's why. If it treats the audience as morons that's just too bad.

The 1 cop is dismayed that he's the only one seeing that behavior and when he says ""you didn't see it"" he's coming to terms with how fucked the situation is.

Then as the police are walking with the guards, they are put in a vulnerable position, the flanking. It is not 100% clear that the guards are in on it, and from the perspective of the police, being around unknown men with guns made them nervous. This is compounded by the fact that the security guards know that they are one wrong step from being found out, and as you saw, were willing to commit murder of an FBI agent and several police to escape detection. 

So, the officer is on guard and super nervous, when confronted by unknown variables with guns, in a remote location, with no chance for back-up. Once he feels the lions closing in around him and the others, his fight or flight response begins triggering.

Quite honestly, I don't know why they let them keep the guns. They should've played dumb and left, and returned with a larger group of men. They were outflanked, out-maneuvered, and taken by surprise, and paid with their lives for their carelessness. ",6ueskb

I think they drove his body up there and dumped it and then continued back to the oil rig - what confuses me is that they must have done it so the tracks led from the drug house - but if they were counting on the tracks being there, then continuing on to the rigs, which the tracks do I believe, would tie them to the body - but maybe it is better that way, then if the tracks went from and back to the oil rig only - maybe it's better if it is somewhat ambiguous, then if all the tracks go to and from the oil rig only... ???",6ueskb

dqw2pr9,"They were up at Gannett peak which is almost 14k ft so the atmosphere can only have about 40% of what there is at sea level. Also pulmonary edema GREATLY increases past 12k ft which they were.  I'm from Boston and consider myself to be in pretty good shape (I jog quite a bit). I spent this summer working on a ranch on this same reservation just by chance. The ranch was at 9200 ft and that was enough to make just about any manual labor five times more difficult than normal. Every single night I'd go for a jog and wouldn't even be able to make it out of the driveway without having to walk. In Boston I run 5k's often and confidently. The point is, I think the whole lung bursting for both Natalie and the rapist is completely legit. It's absolutely insane what that type of elevation does to your body, even when you're living at that level consistently.  The air is also ridiculously dry. ",6ueskb
dqdj44c,"All I can think of is that their lungs burst because of the fact that they were in a full on sprint. If they used nearly all of their lung capacity, more of their lungs would be exposed to the cold causing damage. Idk... Running at a reasonable pace allows for the body handle it better?",6ueskb
dqer4dp,"They say it gets to -20F at night (we're assuming because it's set in the U.S.). If it were a simple conversion, that would be -29C, but it's not. The temperature scales are set differently in relation to the freezing temp of water. Water freezes at 32F, which means -20F is 52 degrees below freezing. 

The freezing temperature for water on the Celsius scale is 0, which means -20C is 20 degrees below freezing. So there's a -32 degree difference between what you were running in and what the character endured.  A world of difference. 

In such weather, the rapidity of the breathing is the key to how it kills you. If you breath slowly, the air and any fluid in your lungs has time to be warmed by the body, at least above freezing, for relatively short periods of time. Any kind of mask that can help warm the air before it gets to your lungs is a help. If you breath too fast, that can't happen, and as they say in the movie, fluid in the lungs can crystalize. And, if you're body is already cold, I'd imagine it would happen faster.

dltqjgw,"Yeah, I mostly enjoyed it, but it had some problems. I'd probably say I felt it was a 6/10 or so for me personally. When it was good it was really good, which made some of the problems more frustrating, because I did feel it was close in many ways to being a great film. 

One thing I mentioned elsewhere was that Renner's character felt too competent and in control at all times—I never really doubted he'd get his man and solve the case, which dampened the tension a bit for me. He was just too good, he always knew what to do in every single situation and never seemed like there was a chance he'd fail. 

I agree some of the dialogue was overwritten, especially the bigger monologues. The one he gives to the grieving father felt a bit forced to me, and kind of a weird thing to say to someone who has *just* now found out they've lost their daughter. That scene had another thing that bugged me, when Olsen's character walks in on the wife cutting herself and... They all just walk away from that and close the door? Like what. It just felt gratuitous, grief-porn really, and the characters reactions to that were bizarre. I don't mind a movie being serious and eschewing in levity, but that was a bit much. 

I would've also liked if the environment had played a bigger role in the plot as well. They talk a lot about the unforgiving terrain and scenery, but it never really proves to be that much of an impediment for the most part to the characters. I would've liked nature itself proving to be somewhat of a bigger obstacle for the characters. ",6ueskb

I see a lot of people praising the acting here, but I felt the exact opposite. None of the characters seemed to mesh too well and the tone was all over the place. I don't blame the actors, though. I think Sheridan is not nearly as good a director as he is a writer.

That whole scene when they visit Gil Birmingham for the first time and Olsen's character walks in on the mother cutting herself was shot very awkwardly and then is capped off with that speech from Renner, which I feel the same about as you do. I don't buy any of the motivations for the ending and thought that whole thing played out very strangely and was a huge let-down to the mystery.

dml2g4n,"If I could have a go at counter arguing your issues with the climax (which I thought was done to near perfection), here is some of the reasoning I picked up from the film:

* Just because you, me, and hopefully everyone else here would have a moral compass to stop a rape/murder, not everyone does. As Renner explained, life out there is about survival. The strong prey on the weak, and it's beneficial to travel in packs. Things escalated very quickly from drunkenly joking around to fighting, and people don't think straight in those situations.

* As the man said, it's lonely out there. Nothing but snow and silence. I doubt he was the only one feeling that way. Alcohol enhances those feelings and they were all pretty drunk. Doesn't excuse them, just explains their actions.

* The men didn't have any sort of plan when the cops showed up. They're not trained to deal with that kind of fallout and everyone was improvising. It looked like the dude in charge just wanted them to look around and then get out. But his workers panicked and shit went south real quick.

* I think it's really important to recognize that people don't think things through in these sorts of situations and many brash decisions are made in the heat of the moment. What's logical and moral for you and me might not occur to someone else in that situation. This film did a marvelous job establishing the reservation as a sort of modern ""wild west"" where shit happens. 6 officers patrolling an area the size of Rhode Island. Morals and ethics are replaced by domination and survival, which I think is enough explanation to why the security team acted as they did.

All that being said, this is just my interpretation of why things went down the way they did. Everyone has their own viewing and I hope I could shed some light on things that might have been overlooked.",6ueskb
dmo91jq,"Yeah, it was pretty bizarre.  Did the security guys think they were going to get away with it, blowing away all the police?  Speaking of which, very little emotion on the part of BLM Renner or the FBI agent about all the police who lost their lives.

And if these security guys were willing to go to those lengths, how about they go and really lose the body of their buddy who they killed, find the girl's body and cover their snow mobile tracks, or at least make it so the snowmobile tracks are no longer leading to anything big?  You didn't need a tracker to follow the snow mobile tracks right to the badness, including coming right out of the rig straight to the body of their missing coworker. 

It took a turn for the weird. 

EDIT:  Thinking about it more, and reading down the thread:  I don't think there's much in these theories that the security guys executed some bad frame job on the trailer living bad drug guys.  They wouldn't have been ready for Black Day at Deadman's Gulch with the police and feds if they were executing some frame job and the police were just looking around and asking questions.  There were two plans that were the simplest with the greatest chances of success:

1.  Neither body can be found.  Security guys clean as best they can. ""The lovers must have run off.""

2.  Whatever happens with Nathalie's body is allowed to happen.  The boyfriend, Matt's body must not be found.  ""Yeah, they had some kind of altercation and she stormed off, and he got disgusted and followed her on snowmobile about half an hour later.  He never came back.  Did something happen, officer?""   ",6ueskb
dn2sdrw,"I agree that the way the gunfight was executed could have been so much better. 

Their all being cool with murder was a bit of a stretch but having a group of guys out in a remote shithole being a gang of opportunistic rapists is, unfortunately, not much of a stretch. There are a lot of remote corners of Alaska and Canada that have really high rates of sexual violence against women per capita. The way they all ended up in on the violence reminded me of the rape and murder of that 14-year-old Iraqi girl and her family by a group of American soldiers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmudiyah_rape_and_killings

And also reminds me of the long list of various sexual crimes/murders and subsequent coverups and hushing of witnesses/victims committed by American contractors for the past couple of decades (KBR, Halliburton, Blackwater, etc.).

But frankly there needed to be something a little incredible behind the girl's murder or it would have just been like a 2 hour long episode of some crime investigation show with a mundane reveal that it was just a jealous ex-boyfriend all along, but with beautiful cinematography. You mention Sicario and Hell or High Water handling things so much better.

This is sometimes done also as a sacrifice to assist in the healing of another. Another form is the cutting shown. It is culturally accurate. It was not done much in the 20th century due to colonization, but has seen a resurgence in recent years among some who follow a traditional path. It would be a violation of religious freedom and interference in spiritual practice to stop this. I agree that it is surprising though that the FBI agent was so quickly able to ascertain the nature of the situation and make the decision not to interfere. That was respectful.](#spoiler)

1. Yes, that was weird. I didn't thinks he was cutting her wrists and assumed she was just cutting her hand or something. Which doesn't make it okay but you would assume the husband would intervene.

2. I figured she just didn't report anything and acted like the coroner hadn't looked at the body yet. It was just a couple days so it's not too crazy.

Lauderdale and inappropriately dressed for Wyoming winter weather, we dont know anything else about her.  The movie would still be exactly the same if she was not in it--Renner had all the lines, a developed character, and the complete  strong, silent, white savior type.

Then Renner and the father have a big profound conversation outside about never adapting to death, and Olsen is presumably just inside patiently waiting.  

At first I strained to listen to the poetic words in the music, thinking it was another characters narration, then just as I'm listening it gets interrupted with a snowspeeder - pulling me out of the film again.  

The cabin scene used the flashback as a cheap trick to become a ""dark"" film, justifying Renner's treatment of the villain. But why was this scene necessary? The protagonists, who we've been following through, don't get to see the flashback so why should we? I feel like the film should have left it to the imagination rather than rub our faces in it, but Sheridan knows it would have been a weaker, lamer film without that moment of horror to wake everyone up.  

Renner's heroic saving of the damsel in distress was insanely cliched, as was all the sexism generally around a pretty young FBI agent and a moody man of nature saving the day.

Edit: So maybe it's this simple...the guards drove a snowmobile in a truck with Matt's body to the drug den, and then left from there on the snowmobile to stash the body to make it look like he came from there. They thought the tracks would be covered up by the blizzard that never came. 
So Corey and Jane find the body, and then have to get him out and ID him, and it gets dark so they leave. The next morning, while Jane goes to investigate Matt's job site, Corey heads back into the woods to hunt the mountain lion. Near the den, he finds the other end of the single snowmobile tracks headed toward the drilling site. 

His logic was that if someone had left from the drug den, they would have had to return, but didn't, since there was only one set of snowmobile tracks. He then sees a single set of tracks heading TOWARD the drilling site, but no other tracks heading out. So he knows it was one vehicle that went from the drug den to the body site and then to the drilling site. 
The question is, why didn't he go back to the body dump site in the morning and pick up the snowmobile tracks from there...

I think we're meant to assume, and that the cops assume, the death had something to do with the drug house and that neither death was related to the drilling site, and that the only dude who might know had been shot? 

EDIT: Hold on....wait. When Natalie first shows up and Matt answers the door, she says someone dropped her off at the top of the road right? Who was it and could that have something to do with the tracks? Was it her brother?

In Wind River you've got a tense situation that came out of fucking nowhere and the chaos and the sheer unexpectedness of it and the fact that there is no way to predict how it's going to down, these factors made it super tense.

And now he's basically sidelined in every franchise of his, it's not very enjoyable to be a supporting role actor when you had every chance to be a star. That's how I dissect it anyway.

My point is less about the fact that the Renner is white and more about the fact that the character is white, and I address this in the latter paragraphs.

This absolutely would have worked, had Banner done what she was supposed to and reported and left. It would have bought the rig guys time to destroy and plant evidence, since local law enforcement had no jurisdiction where they were.

That was what made Banner strong--doing what was right instead of doing what she was supposed to do.

I think the hardest thing for me to believe in this about her character was that she *was* after all an FBI field agent. I mean, I understand that she's 'young' in the story but surely to be an FBI field agent you must first understand the basic principals of police work, investigative work, forensic science, etc.? Also, I'm quite sure police officers/FBI/etc. are instructed not to stand in front of doorways when knocking in case of the very thing that happens in the film.

She felt more like the Lawyer in Jurassic World than any sort of law enforcement officer.

IIRC the only thing she actually *did* that no other character did was ordering the rape kit. Besides that she basically stood around being told what to do by other characters. No actually investigative work was done by her. The scene with the coroner just seemed like Sheridan was trying to poke fun at all those silly cop movies where the coroner calls random deaths 'murder' without actual evidence.

Most of these complaints are not Olsen's fault, they are the writer's though.

I can't help but be brought back to Insomnia, a very similar film that was executed much better (both the original and the remake). The main detective might have been out of his element, he was against insurmountable odds with a disorganized police force, but he at least still had a basic understanding of police work.

Then when she's outside of the doorway we get the super obvious ""THERE IS AN *FBI* AGENT STANDING RIGHT *IN FRONT* OF THE DOOR! YOU BETTER OPEN UP!""

Plus, the bruises on the face where an obvious giveaway to the point that they basically just spell out 'yep these are the bad guys' so there was no real tension throughout the entire scene. We know they're a part of it and we get a scene that just says ""yeah, we weren't lying before, they are the bad guys"" and then a big dumb shootout.

The son could have been entirely removed. I thought when Renner promised to 'make it up to him' that would come around someway but it didn't. I thought maybe the focus Renner mentioning gun safety to his son would come around some way, but it didn't.

dq489gb,"I just don't at all buy that their subtle flanking movement was a bigger indicator that they were dangerous than the **guns drawn standoff** they all have immediately following. It's like stubbing your toe and and then having a stroke, but telling the paramedics to check your toe out like it's the bigger issue. The flank is all but totally irrelevant given the standoff and the reveal that they know Natalie is dead. The fact that this guy was freaking out over the flank of all things makes zero sense to me, as if had Banner seen it, they would have responded differently? You could remove the ""you didn't see it?"" line from the movie and effect *nothing*, you could actually remove the flank and replace it with any reason to instigate that standoff and the movie still doesn't change. For that reason, I think the standoff hurts the movie, it's really jarring when everybody just holsters their weapons and continue to walk to the trailer (the cops even let some of the gaurds follow and let others lead, i.e. let them surround them, wtf?!). I would have preferred them just walking to the trailer having tense and revealing discussion, get to the door, knock, cue flashback, continue the movie. I don't see how the standoff-lol-jk part of the scene does *anything* but confuse people and make the cops look like completely untrained dumbasses, becasue in real life those guards would have immediately been taken into custody. That standoff would **completely** change the situation in real life, but in the movie it doesn't effect a damn thing in the behavior of the officers. Sure, it's puts them on edge, but they were **already** on edge, and it would have made the shotgun blast more surprising and believable (because the cops would only have had conversational warning signs, not a **standoff**, which is the most incriminating thing you could have them do aside from actually attacking the officers, which they do later to nobody's surprise except the cops in this story, somehow).

The fact that they have a standoff and then pretend it never happened was just bizarre and hard to believe even without that confusing and out of place line. There is some great writing in this movie, but man, certain stuff just should have been edited out, because they don't help the movie.",6ueskb
dq3gujn,"Yeah, I mean, I don't disagree with anything you said, but it doesn't answer what the officer was referring to her not having seen. What did he see that she/we didn't? If the answer really is just the flank, then I don't think that line works well for the film, as I don't think I was the only one looking for an answer after the line. It's not a line that moves the plot forward, AND it's confusing the audience. I was literally trying to guess if maybe he saw a sniper or a bomb or something (but he wouldn't have been coy and mysterious about either of those, so wtf is he referring to?)

Overall, I think it's a great scene that has a few critical failures, and a lot of people are going to walk away incredulous because of them. In a handful of ways it's just not very believable. I'm halfway to having the insane tactical oversights + mysterious and unanswered ""you didn't see it?"" line as ruining the scene for me (and it's a crux scene, ruining it ruins the movie).",6ueskb
dq4lr0c,"Eh, you're just reiterating what I already recognized as an ineffective plot device; it's just not that plausible that the subtle flank is the main piece of evidence that they are shady and dangerous; there are two other pieces of evidence that are on orders of magnitude more relevant than the flank, and everybody is witness to them. So the emphasis on this ""seeing"" the flank is erroneous and confusing.

>The officer says that because he sees the obvious, which is that the security are not to be trusted.

Exactly, it's **obvious**, it's so obvious and NOT because of the flank. **Everybody** in the audience sees this obvious reality because it is spoon-fed to us through a guns drawn standoff, and then all the characters seem to totally forget it ever happened. The flank is the last piece of evidence that made it obvious, but Sheridan is treating it like it's the *only* thing that made it obvious, and that was very hard to see as plausible.

As for private property without a warrant, they consented to their being there, and agreed to lead them to the trailer, answered some basic questions of there own volition, etc. They never demanded to see a warrant, or asked them to obtain one; they could have, but they never did, so nothing the officers did there would have been inadmissible in court. Just because you are on private property doesn't mean to can legally pull a gun on an FBI agent who is investigating a homicide, that's not an authority a civilian holds, sorry... That's why Jane is able to (rather unrealistically) defuse the standoff: she holds the superior authority and jurisdiction. Now that I consider it, it's similarly implausible that everybody even had to argue about that. Who would ever think that some private security yokels have jurisdiction over a federal agent? That's what federal kinda means, haha! It's ridiculous, like having a mall cop challenge a highway patrolman over authority. It's where this film becomes really hard to suspend disbelief for, which is too bad because I otherwise really enjoyed it. They could have removed the weird standoff-lol-jk moment without changing the plot at all, and would have avoided this incredulity.

I really would love to see ONE real world case where something like this happened: where somebody on private property drew a gun on a federal officer, or any officer, and after some discussion, they all holster their weapons and continue on whatever path they were on before the drawing of guns. I call bullshit, that has never happened once; that person was taken into custody. Maybe they aren't charged with a crime, but they aren't just treated as if they are no longer a threat after everybody settles down, they would be disarmed and detained immediately for the safety of the officer, and then after everything is sorted out and understood be released.

Perhaps the ""You didn't see it?"" officer is supposed to be the foil for the audience, he is supposed to be the one person that has the same perspective we hold: that these are threatening men who are involved with this crime, but it's so implausible that he is the **only** one that feels that way given the context. Even if he was somehow the only one picking up on the fact these guys maybe aren't on their side, he wouldn't just say ""you didn't see it?"" and then go on his merry way to the trailer seconds later, he'd say ""no, no, everybody stop, these guys are involved and tried to attack us, they all need to drop their weapons and get on their knees! etc."" The fact that he is scared shitless one second and then just causally waltzing up to the trailer with everybody else the next is wildly inconsistent.",6ueskb

dr11uuc,"I have been perusing this thread, hoping for any references to the symbolism, and though you aren't referring to my very specific question, at least you aren't talking about the flanking/standoff/""Didn't you see it?"" part.  You raise a very good point about the theme of broken families in the film.  Shooting wolves that are minutes - maybe seconds away from attacking livestock is a long walk in the park from killing a family (of predators) chilling in their den.  My query has to do with Renner's trek to the den, and the black spider we see skittering through his freshly made tracks.  It seemed out of place, and in films such as Wind River, I figure there was a reason we see this arachnid, its black body in direct contrast with the white background.  I need someone to tell me if I am reaching, or if my theory is plausible.  I know that in some Native American lore, there exists a trickster spider.   I submit that this was a clue by the writer/director telling us that anyone expecting this movie to end with [someone being mauled by a mountain lion is going to be disappointed.  The lions actually end up helping the protagonist by pointing him in the correct direction.  They are not presented as an immediate threat to Renner, so he tells them ""End of the line for you."" I agree with you regarding the reason for his reluctance at this point. He then sees the gathering at the trailer and his directive changes.  He knows that if he executes the family, he will be alerting the suspects of his presence and also giving away his  cloistered position. ](#spoiler)  The climax of the movie did not end as many (I can't be the only one, can I?) expected.

They did a FLANKING maneuver to surround the cops and the FBI agent, corralling them if necessary. They had it very planned out contrary to your statements. 

4. Again, you've never been out here... never lived in Wyoming. The reservations may have their problems with drugs, with missing women, and so on, but this state is not the wild west, as hard as Hollywood or the state legislature would want you to believe. The 'silence' and 'survival' commentary peddled by the movie is a bullshit excuse for a bad climax.

And again, don't get me wrong, I did think they nailed the openness of Wyoming, and the cold, perfectly. Wyoming may be one of the last places in the United States where men are men, too, and I think that machismo attitude of some of the characters was refreshing. I also thought it shone a light on the problems of Native American communities, specially family dynamics and the breakdown of those dynamics, drug use, and rampant sexual assault. However, I think they went overboard with the survival and isolation element. Way overboard. ",6ueskb

Pete, understanding the full extent of his plight, 'wimpers' off and dies pitifully with lungs full of frozen blood. Renner's character never successfully killed the lion which he tracked right up until the climax of the movie, when he finds the lions den. Pete is the lion. I also think it was loosely implied that Cory's daughter's died as as the result of some kind of assault by another sadistic man. May as well be Pete. A lion is a lion. How does this sound?

I agree with you about the security guards being ridiculously underprepared and having no plan at all to deal with law enforcement after they commited two murders. Just murder a bunch of cops and get away with it? I agree that part was strange but as the other commenter mentioned they seemed frantic and not exactly thinking straight. 
But your issue with how they were all portrayed as evil rapists and not one had the decency to stop the rape and murder, sadly this isn't hard for me to believe. The only decent one in that crew *was* the boyfriend. It's implied that there was buildup prior to the incident as it was clear Natalie was uncomfortable around those men and Matt was very concerned as soon as they arrived drunk. They probably hated Matt because he was ""better"" than them, handsome and had a beautiful girlfriend. That resentment plus liquor and being without women for however long made for a horrible combination. We all know of cases where groups of soldiers, for example, commit similar acts when grouped together. I come from an oilfield background and there is stereotypically a type of guy that ends up on isolated rigs. ""Rough around the edges"" is a good way to describe it. Add that to the fact that they were security contactors as well. Obviously it's a stereotype and they're not all shitty people, but this is a little more believable than if it were, say, a group of scientists studying penguins or something.",6ueskb

Sold out character development for action which I think was a poor choice in this film, the direction lost a lot of consistency as a result. The only decent part in the second half of the film was the discussion with the father, the film needed a lot more moments like that and a lot less horribly directed action sequences.

The good news is that our bodies are highly adapted to living in cold weather and there are many built-in protections that ensure that our lungs will not freeze from cold air. First, air is immediately heated up when it reaches your nose and mouth due to mucous. Ever wonder why you nose runs in cold weather? It is a defense mechanism that helps to heat up air before it reaches your lungs. Due to the importance of mucous and the amount produced, it is very important to stay well-hydrated when running in the cold.

Second, the lungs have a huge supply of blood. Being one of the most critical organs in the body, there are numerous blood vessels and capillaries that provide a constant supply of warm blood to the lungs that keeps them warm. Any cold air that makes it to the lungs is immediately warmed up and presents no threat of freezing. With that said, running in cold air does present some risks to certain people who have asthma.

But if it was her tracks, then from the body to the rig would have 3 sets of tracks.  Her's, the guards coming to dump the body, and then going back.  But then is it just dumb luck they dumped him along her tracks?  Or did they explicitly trace her steps ?",6ueskb
ds69aml,"The brother knew the rig dudes from selling them drugs, I'd assume - probably how Natalie and Matt met, through him. They had presumably taken that shortcut over the mountain before and dumped the body where they did so it would look like a drug-related murder. From the tracks going over the lion den, the sled came from the rig, not the other way.

The rig dudes went to the drughouse looking for her, I assume, because that is literally the only place nearby she could go for help. Probably, one took the sled out looking for her that way and to dump the body then get picked up by the truck which had driven down the road looking for her that way. And probably others had gone in different directions looking for her, too.",6ueskb
dqewrxa,"Yes, I think it was her brother who dropped her off.  So, I think the oil rig guys want to make it look like Matt was killed by Natalie's brother as revenge.  The difficulty they had in setting that up in terms of tracks in the snow is probably similar to the difficulty we're having trying to understand it.  Somehow they would need to show Matt and the brother meeting at some point and then the brother dropping the body in the woods near the lion den.  So a set of tracks from the drug den up the mountain to the woods and back makes sense, as that would be the brother dumping the body.

""Predatory violence"" as a criminologist would define it requires target selection and premeditation. They were certainly not predatory towards Natalie or Matt, that was 100% group violence.

dq358z4,"That's not at all what they are saying. I think they make a very valid claim that the crimes they commit cannot be classified as predatory, and it's really unlikely they are repeat offenders. I actually think this is scarier and more profound than a group of rapists/killers. The point is this kind of violence exists in a lot of places and happens all the time, perpetrated by people that *maybe* would not have done this had they been given different opportunities in life, etc. but are put in a context that not only allows for this kind of violence, but allows them to slowly justify it in their own heads through groupthink and/or simply being miserable for long periods of time. A overarching theme of the movie is how much that region takes from the people in it, and that perhaps includes the morality of some. Recall [Pete and his confession](#spoiler), basically just complaining that the place sucks, which wears at people and ends up begetting terrible violence. It's not at all a justification, but it is a reality... no doubt similar things have happened over and over again, because all the circumstances allowed for it. The movie isn't about a specific group of drill security guards who commit egregious acts of violence in the region, it's about how the region generates this kind of violence in many ways and with many people, and that native american women are the most at risk, yet routinely ignored on a larger scale.

I think you have bit of a misunderstanding of how criminology defines predatory violence. Just because they are not enacting predatory violence doesn't mean they are not violent rapists, and in fact, they are guilty of an even scarier form of violence.

The event in Wind River was not predatory in nature, it was actually a more caustic type of violence commonly called the ""group monkey fight""; this is when a group of individuals who have already established bonds feed off each other's energy and effectively/entirely ""other"" their victim. They, as a group, are able to diffuse responsibility and are thus able to entirely dehumanize their target, and it gets bad very very quickly. This ability to ""other"" a person comes from our evolutionary history as part of nomadic tribes, where our success depended on close relationships with our tribesmen, and aggressive wariness of those who weren't of our tribe. As humans we are successful only because we form personal bonds and social structures that utilize group cooperation, but when it came time to war with another tribe we have to somehow defy that natural ability to empathize and see others as similarly human. If you convince yourself the other tribe **isn't** human and entirely ""other"" than you, then you can effectively go to war and kill (and mitigate a lot of psychological trauma). This happens on smaller scales all the time in the modern world, GMFs are one particularly violent demonstration of it.

So back to Wind River: The drill crew was able to effectively other Matt and Natalie, and a GMF resulted. This is not predatory violence, it's actually worse when it comes to statistical odds of survival. We are not letting this guys off the hook by not classifying them as predators. The GMF is easily *the* worst type of violence to find yourself confronted with,  and the only strategies I've even heard of working to escape them require a lot of awareness, creativity, and luck. This is actually why the scene is so effective IMO; of course any depicition of rape is deeply unsettling, but in this case of a GMF, we know implicitly that so little can be done, that it can only end up going one way without a miraculous intervention [(which happens in the present part of the film, but not the flashback)](#spoiler). Even after Natalie escapes the assault, we get zero sense of relief, not because we know she dies later, but because we know the GMF is still in progress; even if we don't explicitly know how that violence is classified and all the vocabulary, we inherently know how deadly it is.

tl;dr The drill crew were not predators in the shadows planning a rape, they were much closer to something like a gang initiation, which are 1st degree GMF's (i.e. they plan those to some extent). Wind River was clearly a 2nd degree GMF, as they had no idea she was going to be there. It was entirely spur the moment (which does *not* make the violence any less egregious). GMFs, as pretty well depicted in the film, typically escalate extremely quickly and towards profound violence.",6ueskb

dqesm54,"You have to look at it in context. It's not a normal police vs. civilians altercation. This is a group of law enforcement officers, most of whom have no legal authority in the location, and a group of armed private security personnel, who obviously drink too much. 

As they reiterate over and over, this is a place that is so far out of the way that there's no real backup. People disappear.

To the cop who said ""You didn't see it..."" it looked like they moved into a formation to flank them and get them in a crossfire. Everybody's armed, so he drew his weapon. That's when everyone drew their guns and the standoff ensued. 
To the other cops and Jane apparently, it seemed like the cop got jumpy and drew his gun to address a nonexistent threat, and everyone else drew in response to that. 

It's almost like like two groups of soldiers from different countries who aren't enemies but aren't allies either meet out of the reach of all superiors and have a moment where they raise their arms in confusion. 

It's admittedly strange that Jane wouldn't demand the security guards disarm before they went any farther, or that the guards didn't demand that, even though she's an FBI agent, she come back with a warrant after the altercation. The only thing I can come up with is that Jane figured if they left at that point, the guards would almost certainly have had the time and inclination to cover up and hide whatever they might find, and she wasn't going to let that happen. Plus she's on a clock. She doesn't have a couple days to wait, because as she said, she'll be ordered back to her station once the death isn't reported as a homicide.  Also, she may have figured that if things were going to go south, that was where it was going to happen, and they had gotten past it. She's supposed to be young, inexperienced, utterly out of her element...

[As far as why the guard's didn't have a better plan...how much time did they really have? OK night 1, they kill Natalie's boyfriend and she runs out to her death in the cold. The following morning, Corey finds her body. Later that day, probably around when the guards are waking up from their hangover sleep, Corey and Jane find Matt's body and identify him by that evening. We're still on day one, which ends with Corey and Jane talking in Corey's house at night.](#spoiler) 

The next morning, they're at the drilling site. So the guard's have about half a day and a night to figure things out, in between arguing and blaming each other and maybe even trying to remember exactly what they'd done the night before. 

Also, there was supposed to be a blizzard that never materializes...it snows for a bit when Jane arrives and then lets up. The guards probably never thought [either body would be found until spring, if at all. They likely thought the bodies and their tracks would be covered by mid-morning, and that the scavengers would get most of the bodies before anyone found them, if at all. Hell, the only reason Corey found Natalie's tracks and body was because the mountain lion tracks led him right to it, just like following the lions to their den led him to the snowmobile tracks and the drilling site.](#spoiler) 

The guards certainly didn't expect the FBI to be there the very next morning asking about Matt. [They had a weak story about Matt and Natalie getting in a fight and her running off, him going after her, which they probably came up with when they heard something on the radio about her body being found. They never expected them to find Matt, since they stashed his body in the other direction, and I don't think they expected the FBI to be there. That story probably would have been enough to get rid of the Tribal Chief, at least for a while, if he'd been there alone.](#spoiler) 

All that being said. I agree with you in part, because, the only goal the guards could have had was to [funnel the cops to the trailer with the two guys camped out in it. So, their endgame, if they couldn't just get the cops to turn back at the gate so to speak, was to kill them all and I guess leave them in the snow too, which is pretty absurd. But...they are a gang of drunken rapist murderers who have gone a little nutty from isolation and cabin fever it seems, so maybe they didn't have a sane plan. They might also dabble in meth or heroin, which makes for poor decisions.](#spoiler)

I agree, that whole sequence would have flowed better and more logically if the mexican standoff had simply never happened. Maybe they thought it needed to feel like Corey had more time to get into shooting range?  ",6ueskb
dq42hsj,"The guy didn't actually ""see"" anything besides the flank. Rather, he's so concerned and frightened because of what the flank *implies*. Had someone else witnessed what the security guards were up to, they'd immediately understand how dangerous the situation was. He's asking if Agent Banner if she saw that -- the implied danger, the hostility of the guards, etc -- and that's why the question is so loaded. I think the line absolutely works in the context of the situation, and adds to the atmosphere of building dread: ""you didn't see it?

dq5poe5,">I really would love to see ONE real world case where something like this happened: where somebody on private property drew a gun on a federal officer, or any officer, and after some discussion, they all holster their weapons and continue on whatever path they were on before the drawing of guns. I call bullshit, that has never happened once; that person was taken into custody. Maybe they aren't charged with a crime, but they aren't just treated as if they are no longer a threat after everybody settles down, they would be disarmed and detained immediately for the safety of the officer, and then after everything is sorted out and understood be released.

Totally agree. It was very hard to believe that scene from either perspective. The first red flag would have been how the private security detail that should be sitting on their asses all winter are for some reason all out and about with weapons visible. Especially the dude clutching the shotgun w/both hands instead of just carrying it in the sling, he's obviously expecting a fire fight from the get go. Then she points out how they're all bruised up, seem to know more about the murder than they should and finally has to diffuse a tense stand-off where everyone certainly would have ended up shot or dead. But apparently none of that is enough to cause any of the police or a rookie FBI agent to abandon their mission to inspect a trailer/talk to Matt. Seriously? 

I also found the behavior of the security detail to be really strange. Their leader seems like smart guy & smooth talker, but apparently the only strategy he can come up w/is to kill half a dozen cops/FBI in cold blood. They could have come up with a million different excuses for where Matt was or simply insisted the cops come back w/a warrant. Heck, blame it on corporate policy and use the time to cover up the difficult to prove crime. But once you kill a half dozen cops, there's simply no amount of cover-up that can protect you.

It did progress the plot... he found the tracks of the snowmobile used to dump the body so that he could be find the bad guys and be led into the shootout. It was also a metaphor for Renner's character hunting and finding the predators who killed those girls. The scenes of him hunting the lions near the beginning of the movie also helped to establish his skills as a tracker. 

Definitely agreed with the other points. I think there's plenty to criticize in this movie but the tracking stuff and the lions in particular I thought was really well done. ",6ueskb

dos3xw5,"When I was watching this, as well as The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, while I agree the rape was portrayed horrifically, I also found that the camera angles still emphasized the beauty/sexuality of the victim.  Whenever this happens, it puts me in a moral grey area, because the camera is implicitly stating that this female is desirable, and it becomes this yucky experience where even in rape, the female character still gets defined by her attractiveness.

And just to show that I'm not jumping down the throats of all rape scenes: I actually think Game of Thrones does a pretty good job of displaying rape as traumatic and not sexual, as it's very character-based.  A few others - Leaving Las Vegas, Pretty Woman...thinking of rape scenes that were handled delicately.  It doesn't mean they weren't graphic, it doesn't mean they weren't horrific...but for me, it doesn't leave me wondering if, say, the director specifically shot that angle to get a good look at her, not to further demonstrate the horror, but just to give the audience a good gander at a pretty woman.",6ueskb
dmng6jj,"It's agreeable that this film has its issues, but for the most part, the ones you have noted are mostly intended to be that way, and for very particular reason. Before I address these points, please bear in mind these few (major) influences on the film: 

**1. In its purest, most linear and most analytical sense, Wind River is a Western. It's also dynamically allegorical.** I don't mean a ""shoot-em-down-good guy- bad guy"", traditional kind of western. It's much deeper and, in many cases, this film is paying homage to western film arcs and storytelling. The forced and purposefully placed nuances may seem awkward, but try to appreciate that Sheridan is attempting a nod to the *past and present western, all at once. These scenes make you uncomfortable because they are not meant to be fully realistic; they are meant to blend reality with western film, and with metaphors, etc.*   **2. Sheridan is known for writing contemporary westerns, and often with fairly impressive analytical depth.** If you look up various film analysis of his other writings, it can get deep fast. **3.This is Sheridan's directors debut**. Yea, I thought some parts were gaudy or a bit overbearing, and that sometimes the dialogue maybe didn't fit well. But he's fairly new to the Director's chair, and it's possible he got carried away trying to over-romanticize some scenes. I so imagine if he had directed *Hell or High Water*, it would've been noticeably different. But I thought that turned out fucking amazing anyways.

**To try and address the list you mentioned:**


**1. They do not look down on the Native population, from what we know. They simply work out in the wilderness, but did not grow up on or near the reservation. They are not enemies prior to this crime.** The major outlier is that these men did not grow up on the land: they are not used to it, and may not have bonded or grown stronger from the wilderness as the locals have, and they may not have had similar ethnic histories/hardships as the locals d0. In addition, these men created a lawless and wreckless bond after they committed the rape and murder, further separating them morally and socially from everyone else.

You mention there is no build-up to their introduction, yet, from the second they first mention those men working there, it's clear from context that they are considered outliers, and mainly keep to themselves. Already, there is foreshadowing. There are other beautifully subtle hints leading up to the shoot-out-scene, and they are intentional.

**2. This entire scene epitomizes yet another traditional Western cornerstone that Sheridan pays homage to: the Harshness of the Wilderness. Here, Sheridan takes that to the next level, and forms the wilderness into an actual enemy.**  I do agree that Pete's excuse of ""the snow"" was corny and a bit over the top, but could I also appreciate the hell out of it, it was like a little nugget that Sheridan slipped in (could've been done with more tact, and at a different time, though). Sheridan knew why it had to be brought up, it was entirely central to one of the major themes. Pete's complaint about ""snow"" was him referencing the isolation and cold as an enemy, even though he didn't realize it. While it is no valid excuse for what he did, he sees it as his enemy and what set him up to do the things he did. **The director further hits his point home when the traditional ""show down"" is not between Renner and the rapist...it's between the rapist and nature.** Again, paying some homage to traditional westerns.

**3. This scene also references two additional major cornerstones of any western: lawlessness, and a shootout.** The second I heard the security detail say line ""You're on private property, you have no jurisdiction here.."" or something like that, *I KNEW shit was going down.* That was a red flag that they were beyond a land of reasonable law enforcement, and that they could enact lawlessness if they wished: there no common understanding or morals, so to each their own, and a shootout was gonna happen. One FBI agent didn't mean shit amongst these two crowds.

Yes, it was definitely planned, *all of it.* **Understand that these men had already chosen the option of taking the law and taking morals into their own hands; that all happened the night of the rape and murder. And they were able to go undetected for a few days due to their (see points 1 and 2) isolation, which ironically ended up bringing them closer together after the murder and rape.**

**4. The ""silence and survival"" motif is meant to go beyond what you see on the screen. It's yet another beautiful (but sad) metaphor that Sheridan constantly uses.** Try to watch this movie as an allegory in it's entirely: why on a Reservation? Why the fact about statistics at the end? Why did wilderness play such a big part? Why animals, and how is Renner's relationship to them a paralleled metaphor? Why was the absence of police and FBI presence constantly brought up and treated as normal? What about the stance on feminism? **Allegory. Allegory. Allegory**. Sheridan blew it out of the water when he wrote *Hell or High Water*, and while *Wind River* may have been a bit oversaturated as his first film, I still can't help but be in awe of how he tied all of these aspects together. In my opinion, he is one of the most talented writers out there, especially in regards to contemporary westerns.

**5. One more thing to consider:** people on here have wondered why the girl or guy didn't take the main lead. While that's traditional in thrillers or possibly crime dramas, Westerns often try to play more into character dynamics, it's all planned, but with a different outcome. A big motif in westerns is having a protagonist embark on a lawless experience (FBI agent and the shootout), and then return to society and find it hard to re-integrate. One of the final scenes depicts Renner trying to ""normalize"" what happened and read her a magazine or make her laugh...but she can't. She brings up the girl again.

Renner was actually her character foil, and hers was his. And while it seemed cliché, it was a nod to the traditional storyline. They were both very different, having lived through different experiences and on different terrain; the viewer needs a comparison, so that's why they are paired up in that sense.

If you go back and watch *Cold in July* or *Hell or High Water*, you'll see similar pairings and outcomes of one of the major characters. The brothers in *Hell* are very different in terms of personality and context, and by the end of the film, the more ""innocent"" one has changed a lot once he has returned to society.

EDIT: grammar ",6ueskb
dmpaqz8,"They were doing their job, but the absolute bedlam among collegaues that happens when a police officer gets injured or killed in the real world totally goes against the total ho humness of the reaction of these two in the movie.

And the rape scene, yeah, I can see your point. My bigger issue is that there were no power dynamics in that scene. They presented these villains as horny, psychopathic, sociopathic, and without morals. There wasn't an escalation of group thinking or 'gang mentality', they just all saw her on the bed and started raping her. It went from 0-60 in about five seconds.... there wasn't any build-up, or discussion amongst the security guards, or animosity brewing between Pete and the couple (other than him being drunk and annoying).

dmb3oe2,"My theory is that yes, they hoped *if* the body was found, they would just assume it was drug-related stumbling...but they didn't really think either Matt or Natalie would be found or found quickly.

She was miles from anything where they found her. If not for the lions, Cory wouldn't have been there...It was just random that they found her so quickly.",6ueskb
dmd7r9g,"So i think Cory went up waaay into the mountains because he wanted to be a sort of back up and sniper cover if things went wrong.  It was coincidental the mntain lions were up there.

dqexzdy,"OK I think I have it figured out. I think some dialog was cut and it made it hard to understand. From the script: 

EXT. SAM LITTLEFEATHER’S HOUSE -- DAY.
The house is the very essence of dilapidation. An old,
burgundy MINIVAN that can’t possibly run, sits beside a
lowered TOYOTA TERCEL in the driveway.
HIP-HOP pulses the windows of the flimsy house.
Cory, Jane, and Ben pull off the road. Get out. Cory looks
down -- sees snow-filled SNOWMOBILE TRACKS beside the
highway. They disappear abruptly -- as though they levitated.
Or were loaded onto a trailer ...
Cory begins walking through the snow to the back of the house
as Jane and Ben head to the front door.

----



CORY WALKS THROUGH THE SNOW. He stares at the ground, looking
for anything that tells a story. Notices SNOWMOBILE TRACKS,
almost completely filled in with fresh snow, that run west
into the mountains, disappearing into the black timber.
He stares at the tracks. Mumbles to himself.

CORY

Who goes into the mountains just
before a storm ...

--------

CORY

Natalie died over there -- seven
miles(He points north). Those
tracks lead to the mountain from
here -- that’s five miles.

He points south to tall drill rigs jutting up from the
ground.

CORY (CONT’D)

There’s West-Central’s nearest
rigs. Six miles. Someone unloaded
sleds right here and drove way the
hell out there, but there‘s no
tracks coming back -- why is that?
(Cory points at the house) Do those
assholes look like they’re up for a
trek ten miles into the snow? In
what -- that minivan? The answers
are out there.




——

Cory starts moving off. Jane gathers her strength and
follows.
CROWS can be heard cawing. The trail opens to a clearing, the
snow here is so deep, there is no evidence of any tracks.
But at the far end of the clearing, A DOZEN CROWS gather
around a DEAD SOMETHING.
Cory moves toward it, trudging through the snow. The crows
scream their frustration at having their dinner interrupted.
As Cory and Jane get closer, they relent and fly to nearby
branches.

----- 

So there it is. The guards drove a truck and trailer with a snowmobile to the drug house, unloaded it and Matt's body, and drove into the mountains with it, presumably to dump it closer to there to make it look like that's where Matt had come from. I don't think they planned for their tracks to be visible for any amount of time, as a blizzard was supposed to come in, but didn't. 

the snow around the body is so deep and windswept that Cory loses the tracks and can't follow them from there.    If he had been able to, they would have led right to the drilling rig. 

So, when he finds the mountain lion den, he picks up the single track of the snowmobile again at it's other end, near the drilling site, on the other side of the mountain. ",6ueskb

I also think that the guilt she will face is a major part of the movie. All the survivors deal with guilt.

 ""What if we didn't go away to the motel for a weekend; would our daughter still be alive?""

""What if we had asked about the guy she was seeing, could we have warned her to stay away from the rig?""

I doubt they ever would have been successful in getting away (unless they all fled the country or something), but why wouldn't they want to buy time if they know the cops are sniffing around?

Heck, blame it on corporate policy and use the time to cover up the difficult to prove crime. But once you kill a half dozen cops, there's simply no amount of cover-up that can protect you.

1.  They are racist, in the flashback scene they call Natalie a derogatory term like ""feather nigger"" before Matt punches them.

2.  Renner's character also says how ""silence and cold"" are the only things the Govt. hasn't taken away from the Native Americans.  He draws comparisons between how strong you have to be to survive, and that the distance to the highway is shorter than the distance Natalie ran from the drill site.  

3. We also see the security detail compliant with the crime when Matt repeatedly asks the Leader to do something when the rapist is antagonizing them.  They are supposed to be keeping the peace and security but are corrupt, similar to the archetypal corrupt deputies from Westerns.  

4. I'm still trying to place meaning on all the animals in the film.  Renner's character hunts the wolves in the beginning with the same efficiency he later uses to dispatch the security detail.  I think the horse represents Renner gaining the trust of the natives on the reservation, letting them get to know him, but also showing strength when needed.  But I can't place the Puma yet.  He is repeatedly told that his job is to kill it, but right away he knows its a mother puma just trying to teach her offspring to survive in a changing world.  The puma leads him to the snowmobile tracks, but he spares them in favor of warning his friends.  Perhaps the big cat represents his grief, he never forgets it, but by acknowledging its existence, allows him to keep going, and keep working.

5.  I thought it was interesting how he consols the father, with blunt language about never being the same, and explains how Jane's own strength and will is what kept her alive.  Life isn't fair and it changes you, and he even tells her the story about his daughter as a kind of warning that anything can happen.  The ex-wife says to ""watch him"" in regards to their son, and then he says to Jane to always keep your eyes open, and then he also acts on it, he is always looking and using his binoculars to see the clues around him, because he didn't see his daughters death coming and it changed him.

Also, why would they go to the trouble of driving it from the drug dealer's house - if it was to create tracks from the drug dealer's house, they would have to assume that it would be likely to also see the tracks going to the drilling site - and if they didn't think the tracks would be around long enough, then why go to the trouble?  I suppose maybe because, if someone did find the tracks, it is certainly better to have them from the drug house, even if they go to the drill site, rather than go from and back to the drill site - that latter case would be more damning I guess.

So, she was maybe dropped near her brothers house by her friend that went into town to see the movie. Then, took the snowmobile to the drill site to see Matt. Also, it looked like those same snowmobile tracks went past the Mtn. Lion den, which possibly helped lead the Mtn. Lions back along her trail to near the brothers trailer, at which point they don’t find any food so they mosey down the highway a bit until they get to the parents house, where they kill the Steer.

dn7kl0d,"Yes I think this is the right answer. 

They had killed Matt, and needed a way to dispose of the body. They steal a snowmobile from the local druggies, one of whom happens to be the brother of Natalie, and try to frame them. 

They know it doesn't have to be a GOOD frame job, because of the problems of local jurisdiction. It just needs to be believable enough to make a mess.

Basically they were going to tell (or imply) this story: Nat and Matt have a fight and she storms out. He thinks she's gone to her brother's house and follows her there. The brother and his junkie friends attack and kill Matt, (thinking he's done something to Nat) and ditch his body up the hill on their snowmobile. 

Meanwhile Nat was never at the brothers house, having died of exposure on the way. 

The local law enforcement would know that's not how it played out, but they would have no jurisdiction at the oil rig, to properly investigate.
 
Meanwhile, the FBI would have been delayed (remember, Banner was supposed to have reported and gone--the follow-up team probably wouldn't have arrived for a few days), and by the time the FBI arrived, the evidence would have been messed up enough--and the oil rig guys would have had time to destroy trailer evidence--that this story could have seemed plausible.

As for them not knowing Nat's brother was a junkie there, I'm sure they knew. After all, the brother had met Matt, he probably met more of them. I imagine that there is probably only one or two bars in town, and those places are where the oil rig guys and the local young adults all hang out.

Any death that occurs during the commission of a felony, is a murder.

dq36q68,"I think the only way the scene is justified as plausible is because everybody there is not all that well trained. The only person we know is very perceptive and has lots of street smarts is absent, until the last minute.

I was initially annoyed that the female lead was so helpless, it felt like a little bit like a damsel in distress trope, but now that I think about it, this one scene is why it needed to be the case. If she wasn't very young, very new, entirely without FBI backup, and in an unfamiliar and unforgiving environment, I would have never bought this scene.

Everybody else in the scene: drill site security guards (not especially trained, they might as well be mall cops), and some county officers + the relatively laid back sheriff who all, given the region, don't see a lot of this kind of action, perhaps never have. The film has a few lines making the point that the sheriff's job is mostly just sending junkies to jail repeatedly, he almost is friendly with criminals of the area. So it's not like the good guys in this scene are all SWAT buddies who all trained together. Indeed, none of them really know each other or worked with each other, and there may be even some level of mistrust between them (Jane trusts the sherrif, but kinda begrudgingly).

All of this means it's a bit more conceivable that they'd make such drastic tactical oversights, but I still have a hard time believing that after the flank and first stand off they'd all just take a deep breathe and continue like it never happened; that was really strange. Considering that followed one of the men giving away they knew about Natalie's death, IRL I think they would have disarmed the men and put them into custody before ever getting to the trailer.",6ueskb

The standoff could be explained as them just trying to protect themselves after they're drawn on. The flank is clearly them looking to get in a position to eliminate the cops.",6ueskb
dq4atwu,"The flank is hardly minor imho. I think the standoff can be written off as a tense moment catalyzed by a dude getting hysterical and spooking everyone to draw their weapons, but the flank shows some kind of intent. Premeditation.

The audience doesn't know *exactly* what the guards were planning, but had the cop not noticed what was going on, the guards could have circled the smaller group and either shot them all dead, or -- at the very least -- controlled the situation. Plus, it seemed like only one dude was aware of the flank, and wanted the others to understand the gravity of the fact that a group of security guards seemed intent on surrounding and drawing their guns on a bunch of cops.

ds2pzjr,"because them drawing out their guns for the standoff is just the natural reaction to the cop pulling his gun on them. For all the cops/the agent who didn't notice the flank it seems like a perfectly reasonable response for the security guys to pull their guns to protect themselves when the cop has drawn his weapon, because they hadn't noticed any reason at that point to be hostile towards the security crew and it looks like the one cop got wrongly spooked drew his gun thinking something was going on (it was, they just didn't notice it.) The standoff could be explained by the security team as ""He drew his gun so we drew ours,"" but the flank is a lot more sinister because at that point wouldn't have any reason to do it unless they were planning to kill all the officers/the agent, because the officers/agent hadn't become hostile towards them yet. It's a subtle thing but I feel like you're just not getting it.

**2.** yes

**3.** hell yes

**4.**  Personally, I think your assessment of the horse scene is spot-on. I got a couple things from the Pumas: I found the ""survival in a changing world"" to be referencing to Native cultures and traditions that were--and still are--struggling to stay preserved in today's socio-cultural landscape. In the film, it's hinted that the Puma's existence is more at stake that is the livestock's; the Puma is doing what it has to, in order to survive. 

At the same time, I first saw the Pumas to represent grief, too. There were 3 of them, perhaps the number 3 could represent the 3 members left of his family? While all essentially coping with the death of their daughter/sister, and how they must survive as a broken family. Perhaps, in that moment of seeing the Puma and cubs, he related to their struggle to just survive. Then he went and shot the fuck outta those buttheads!
Dunno though. I feel like there is more there?

I think one of the biggest takeaways I had from a film Q & A once was that (paraphrasing here) an in-depth film is like a layered work of art: you have the director's meaning, the critic's meaning, and the endless opinions and analysis that  views bring to the table. None of the them are wrong, they are simply different. 

**5.** I think these are all great points- love the connection you found on how the death of his daughter changed him into viewing the world so differently. Going off the Jane's strength bit (which I loved): this film had a lot regarding women, and the equality of strength they can have to others...mental, physical, etc. One of the most powerful lines for me was when Cory/Renner told Pete that while the woman he raped ran 6 miles in the snow, Pete probably wouldn't make it 600 ft. Then, he looked at Pete and said ""That's a warrior. *That's a Warrior.*"" Ugh I almost cried.  It wasn't just regarding her ability to run a far distnce, but it was the fact that mentally, she was pegged as ""a fighter"" when her body was found. She was strong all around. 


**6.** Just a random tidbit: Sheridan is a big supporter of Native rights, and has made it clear he views their past and present treatment with distain. I mentioned on another threat that I recently watched *Ken Burns: The West* on Netflix, and that documentary sheds a lot of light and depth into this film. ",6ueskb

I think that is entirely untrue. Nobody in the history of law enforcement has just been like ""whew, that was tense, but let's just write it off and continue like nothing happened."" If it was *just* the flank, sure, it would not have been minor and helped the ""something's fishy"" tension, but considering it lead to this standoff, it's entirely irrelevant *compared* to the standoff. After the standoff there is no ""something's fishy"" tension, it's 100% obvious ""these guys are involved!"" tension that the cops just ignore, not because any cop would actually do that, but because the plot still needs to move forward and maybe you have the insult the audiences intelligence to do that.

>not a nefarious and predatory plan to subtly back your enemy into a corner.

I totally agree, but it doesn't *need* to be that for the cops to re-evaulate their mission and approach things differently after the standoff. It also gives even **less** credence to the ""you didn't see it?"" line, which is supposedly trying to tell us they ARE being predatory towards the cops. Sure, maybe it's all a misunderstanding that lead to a tense moment, but that's not the kind of moment police officers just forgive 30 seconds later; that is going to cause a long and drawn out process of clarification that involves all those security guards in custody.

My biggest beef is that the standoff serves no purpose **other** than to insult our intelligence, or the intelligence of our police officer protagonists. Imagine they just walked up to the trailer without the standoff, continuing that revealing and tense discussion along the way? Knock, cue flashback, etc. Is the movie any different? No, it's just way way waaaaay more believable, which is why I am so flabbergasted that the standoff didn't get cut in editing. How did nobody involved with this film not mention that the standoff is confusing, implausible, and entirely useless to the storyline?! I feel like this scene got worked and re-worked throughout development and it just got convoluted along the way. At first I thought Jeremy Renner was going to luckily SEE the standoff in his scope and then hurry to intervene, which would have been fine, but no, everybody has to forget anything ever happened for no reason and things have to escalate *again* before he can jump into the fray after making his own discoveries unrelated to the standoff.",6ueskb

dn7nm3k,"It's about a small town. I grew up in rural Upstate NY, not nearly as isolated, but still. 

The ""town"" was the local point for 4 towns in the area. It had 1 supermarket, 4 churches, an antiques store,police dept.,  a library, a school, 1 motel, and 1 bar.  My family had to drive 45 mins to get there, some people came further. 

we left while I was young, but my understanding is that the bar was the only place for anyone to congregate after dark. Locals and any outsiders (we got a lot of leaf-peeping tourists, and some skiers who didn't want to pay high hotel prices in Vermont.)

So Nat would have hung out there, it's probably where she met Matt. Her brother would certainly have been selling there, and it's very likely that the men would have witnessed some sort of interaction between the siblings.


What I love about this story is how it all came back to what Lambert said in the very beginning. Remember, they assumed the druggies were responsible because they were only 3 miles away. The oil rig was 5 miles away, and even Lambert thought she couldn't have made it that far.

But the first thin he tells Banner about Natalie is that she's a fighter, and ""no matter how far you think she could go, I guarantee she went farther"".

He didn't think she could come 5 miles, but she did 6",6ueskb

I have the movie on my computer (torrented it) and watched the scene again and the reason why I don't think she knows fully is in the scene: [Jane goes to the trailer door and sees that it is locked and says ""You sure that there is someone in there?"" The bad guy then says ""Hey Pete, FBI is standing in FRONT of the door....Open Up"". This is right when the Indian Chief is getting notified via radio and yells ""JANE GET AWAY FROM THE DOOR"", and right then Jane gets shot through the door. The bad guy pretty much was giving instructions of where exactly Jane was and to give the signal to open fire. I agree now after watching the scene that regardless, there wasn't much they could have done at that point, and a firefight was almost certain,

Then (as the guy confesses to the FBI lady) they were listening to the police frequencies. When the police find the girl's body, they instead decide to frame her brother. Matt killed the girl, the brother killed Matt in revenge kind of thing.  So they dump Matt's body close to the brother's house.

I have not heard of such an issue in the US.  Women here (even Native women), do not regularly go hitchhiking.  It is not considered a safe way to travel.

The Highway of Tears is also the exception to the norm when it comes to violence against Native women.  Most Native women are victims of men they know or are in a relationship with.  Despite what Wind River hinted at, the perps are not generally white men who happen to be out on the Res.  Most of this stems from alcohol and drug abuse being a HUGE problem among Native communities.  

I do not mind the message of a movie like Wind River, but it heavily implies that white men coming out to Native communities is the source of violence against Native women when it isn't.  Like all women around the world who suffer violence, most of it comes from inside their own home.  ",6ueskb

I have 0 experience with law enforcement, and beyond knowing the ""basic"" stuff, not a ton of knowledge about protocol and all that. I mean, I know enough to realize that continuing the investigation after the standoff was stupid, but was able to rationalize their decision as convincing because: 1.) the film seemed to portray the FBI agent as kind of inexperienced, so it fit within her character 2.) they were on private land without a warrant, possibly outside their jurisdiction? idk, i don't know the intricacies of all that, which compounds point 3.) the cops were first to draw and escalate the situation, and 4.) it's back country Wyoming, where there's probably a pretty strong rough-and-tumble ""frontier"" culture that might justify those security guards being so aggressive given the fact that the cops came to *their* place without a warrant and ready to draw guns, and 5.) looking back and taking in the film as a whole, the FBI agent had no issue bending the law in some areas (she's fine with Renner going off to get the guy). Obviously some of this stuff is based on my own ignorance, but even so, I wrote off the standoff as a ""well, everything is kind of lawless and crazy way out there! Cops are probably used to trigger-happy woodspeople!"" Overall, I was way more worried about whatever the security guards were ultimately planning, so the flank worked really well for me. 

But I also agree that they could have scrapped the entire standoff scene and just kept the quiet, slow-burn tension going. Except then... how do you write in the cop freaking out about the flank?

Besides, as callous as it sounds, audiences generally like feeling bad for marginalized communities, as indicated by the previously listed films, so I honestly don't think this would be too far out of the scope of other successful films with non-white leads. Slave movies were all the rage for a while. 

But it's also true that critical acclaim doesn't correlate with box office success.

I think it would have been interesting to see how this film would have performed.

Unfortunately I had to hang up the gloves when I moved away to college, but my interest and study of violence dynamics never diminished, because IMHO a good understanding of violence is actually more powerful a tool for defense than 10+ years of martial arts training. Knowing how to fight is great, but only helpful when you actually get into a fight, which is last link in the violence chain, and perhaps there were golden opportunities for de-escalation earlier in that chain that went unnoticed because all cognitive effort was spent preparing for/thinking about an imminent fight. If you understand violence dynamics, you can get out of a lot of tricky situations without resorting to blows.

>easier and faster to figure out what to train than how.

I think most people see it that way, but I don't think it's actually that way. I think with just a little bit of knowledge, people can develop large toolsets to avoid and de-escalate. It's a lot easier and faster to read a few books and ruminate on human psychology than it is to spend years learning to fight (and even best fighters are never guaranteed success, violence is chaotic and unpredictable, physically training for fighting gives you small edge at best). But we as a culture just don't approach violence that way, hell, most people consider ""defending yourself"" to exclusively include offensive maneuvers. We're all sorts of mixed up, because of lot of us still want to seem like badass cowboys that never back down from a fight, even if that is the worst way to move through the modern world. I've had to convince a **lot** of men that throwing a punch actually *opens you up*. You'd figure that would be obvious, but it's not, most people believe that if they are threatened physically, the safest tactic is to go offensive. That couldn't be less the case. In order of prioritization, it goes defensive moves, counters, and finally offensive moves. Watch any street brawl youtube video, 90% of the time the person who loses is the one throwing most of the attacks, because a hand that is punching isn't there to defend. Defensive moves hold the fort, effective counters *end* the fight, and offensive moves are inherently risky.",6ueskb

Makes me feel a lot better about my memory then.

I have to disagree with you on a number of other points though. I definitely agree that sport training is a priority for too many amateur athletes these days, but it has an incredibly valid and necessary use - one I don't think I need to explain to you of all people. From what I know, it's a lot easier to de-escalate when you have confirmation that you can, indeed, back your shit up. And while being ambushed or gang-attacked is a terrible thing with few to no good outcomes, being stronger and (*recently*) well-trained will give you a much better chance than the other way around.

Secondly, street brawl videos are *phenomenal* for studying the psychology of the whole thing, but the reality is most people either aren't trained or aren't trained for fighting outside the ring. As such, we can't really use them as reliable evidence for ""this and this works *on the purely physical level*."" I'd rather talk to an old-school cop or bouncer on that stuff.",6ueskb

dq49vs1,"I suggest you re-read Meditations, as Rory's philosophy directly opposes much of what you say in that last post. Physical defense is the last step in the violence chain (unless a death occurs from it), so it should be the least prioritized by the average person. Avoidance, de-escalation, fleeing, fighting, dying. That's the order. Putting fighting first will blind you to anything but the *fight*, and will **increase** the chances of any confrontation resulting in violence, because the only skill you can think about and utilize is physically fighting. Rory would say you should practice sprinting away before you practice a block.

> From what I know, it's a lot easier to de-escalate when you have confirmation that you can, indeed, back your shit up

I think you are really overestimating the average person's ability to stay level headed. Most people who have confidence in their fighting ability allow that to inflate their pride; they won't allow disrespect, and will actually escalate **because** they think ""I can handle this punk"". There is no shame in looking cowardly if it avoids violence (and legal fees, time, etc.), but almost all young males struggle with that.

**What you are suggesting is that you should build an army before you ever study diplomacy**, and Rory would agree that is entirely backwards. And remember, I was just talking about what is easier and faster, I think learning how to talk to people and stay calm and defuse situations is a WAY easier skill to develop than fighting prowess, and way more useful. Everybody has been in arguments and tense situations, everybody already has a lot of these tools of negotiation, expressing sympathy or apology, etc. and it just takes a tiny amount of education and understanding to effectively apply them far before punches are ever thrown. Those non-physical tools can avoid 98% of all would-be fights. Without those tools, any given situation will just escalate and escalate (see Scaling Force).

I also disagree that street brawls aren't relevant in physical analysis. They are typical monkey fights involving untrained people, the most likely kind of violence any male is going to face in their lifetime. If you tell your average joe you need to go on the offensive to defend themselves, they are more inherently vulnerable, **especially** if their opponent does have some training. You will never convince me that utilizing a natural weapon offensively does not remove some defensive capability at least temporarily; you can be as logical as possible in setting up checks and eliminate perhaps two axes of your opponents dimensional mobility with a single move, but you are still sacrificing defense, and for your average person, defensive tactics have the highest odds of keeping them safe. Consider that a lot of fights are not strictly one-on-one, and when you attack, very likely that's when their friend you didn't know was in the fight makes their move as well. This is not actually something up for much debate, the statistics in almost every context are very clear about this: the defenders walk away in better shape overall than had they gone offensive(assuming they had some opportunity to defend). This is especially true with what we are talking about: monkey fights, and the only exception to this is very specific manifestations of predatory violence. It''s too bad that the public perception, even somebody as educated and thoughtful as you on these matters, simply get it wrong or don't believe the numbers for some reason. Martial Arts know this, but many martial artists do not; there is a reason EVERY defense art will start teaching you blocks and parries before anything offensive. And consider this one KEY defensive tactic people often have the opportunity to pursue, but do not, and therefore toss out the window any claim of self-defense: running away.

You also say being stronger and well trained is the ideal if you get jumped by a gang. Rory argues that your strength and training are of the least value in the GMF violence type, and attacking is the most surefire way to get yourself killed. Considering the GMF is the most dangerous type of violence you are likely to face, you **really** ought to go back and read that section in *Meditations*, because you have a way higher chance of surviving being jumped by a gang if you start acting like a stark raving mad, but non-violent, schizophrenic(i.e. othering yourself before they can, and in a way they aren't entirely sure how to deal with). You're maximizing your chance of death if you want to brute force your way out of it with fists and elbows.

dq4cvx9,"No problem man.

I think you and I are having *the exact same problem I was having with other commentators* (which shows I have trouble communicating my ideas - good to know). Basically, let me flesh it out like this, and tell me what you think.

1 - The ""diplomatic"" aspect of it all *should be emphasized and your go-to.* Don't get into situations that could get ugly, study the psychology of the thing, etc. 

2 - If, despite all attempts to prevent it, you are now in a fight, *it is vital that you have good, effective training in violence, if for no other reason than you will be more conditioned to the pain and adrenaline of the encounter.*

[An](http://chirontraining.blogspot.ca/2011/10/values-in-sparring.html) article from Miller, and [another one](http://chirontraining.blogspot.ca/2011/06/teo-asked-to-play-this-morning-to-work.html). Again, I am *not* saying to rely on your fisticuffs - great way to get killed that. But if you are in the situation where you have to use them, it's vital that you can use them as best as you can. (A great example of this - cops. There's a notorious deficiency in their training in *both* of those areas, and plenty of incidents have come across from that. Cop can't defuse the situation, suddenly he's in a violent encounter, and he can't take it down to the appropriate level of violence because he lacks the physical skill and mindset. Result? Guys getting shot reaching in to hit pause on their phone. Guys getting their window broken because the cop couldn't get them out. Guys getting sent to the hospital because the cop couldn't take get an arm-lock on the guy, so he batoned him until his legs were broken and vitals plummeting.)",6ueskb

dq4ciqq,"Okay, so I think I understand the problem here. You are seemingly talking pretty much exclusively about people who *are* trained and spend/t a lot of training. You are considering only a small percentage of the population(and even then, some of your claims still really do not hold water, like brute forcing out of a gang jumping). You need to consider violence dynamics in a more macroscopic context: most people are not trained, those are that are didn't receive very much training. The people like us that spent 10 years or more training kind of approach all of this very differently, and to be honest, they aren't the ones getting into many fights. Also, hubris in your ability will only get you into trouble, the best fighters I've ever met, and the people that have seen the most real world violence, universally say that they move through the world under the assumption that any 6 year old can kick their ass and cause them harm, because realistically, any 6 year old can jab a knife or pull a trigger. The idea that you can size **anybody** up and compare them to your ability on sight alone is the biggest indicator I see of a lack of mastery and primitive understanding of violence dynamics. I'm not saying that's you, but this idea of confidence in ability playing much of a role in how you approach a dynamically violent context is simply kinda weird and not legitimate. You will find no mention of that idea in Rory's, nor anybody else's work, quite the opposite in fact.

>At the end of the day, diplomacy hinges on having a credible threat of violence at your disposal

It really, *really* doesn't. The fact that that is often NOT true on an interpersonal level is what has allowed humans to be successful as a species. Of course we still use the treat of violence as diplomatic ammunition, but anthropologically, historically, and biologically, that is a more primitive and less successful means of communication and achieving peaceful compromise regardless of whether you are talking about kingdoms or just two people in a confrontation. Why do you think the Cold War was such a mess, and why nobody has much issue with Denmark? Indeed, diplomatic relations with a country like North Korea are abysmal entirely **because** each is backing it up with threat of violence. I think it's naive to assume the same dynamics can't or don't regularly play out between just two people.

You really ought to read Scaling Force if you like Rory Miller, I think he'll change your mind about a lot of this; he changed mine, and I think we can both agree he is perhaps a better authority on this than either of us? I am really just trying to regurgitate his ideas, along with a handful of similarly qualified people, because I don't have much authority on this, but they have tons, and it's their ideas I am working with here, not my own.

dq4dpup,"Okay so now we are on the same page, 100%. You put the ""diplomacy"" first, and then fighting prowess second. I did not mean to entirely de-emphasize any value in training, just like I don't think you meant to de-value the non-violent tools. I just took issue because it seemed you swapped that priority. You bring up the crucial moment where you ""have"" to use fists, and that's really entirely different. I am talking about every moment that leads up to that one, and being aware of how  and when that moment occurs. If you have no tools to direct proceeding moments away from that ""no choice left but to fight"" moment, you're gonna have a bad time with every dude who has some attitude at the bar, haha.

Let me put it another way. I don't think every person on earth has an obligation to learn to fight. I think proof that we are doing well as a species overall is that most people **don't** ever learn any kind of combat these days, and live their lives in relative safety regardless. However, I think everybody *does* have an obligation to themselves to be perceptive and aware, to educate themselves about the nature of violence and confrontation/escalation, how to avoid it in the first place, and how to defuse it when it does arise. By nature everybody does this to some extent, everybody knows when they are in an argument and when they aren't, but I think it could use more direct effort and thought from most people, especially young men. Since I ask that everybody be educated about violence, but not that everybody know how to fight, it's pretty clear which I think is the priority skillset.

dq4dp6y,"Dude I am having a lot of trouble keeping track of the conversation at this point - we're both writing such massive walls of text, and I'm a little lost. Still, my brief points:

1 - You're right on the diplomatic front, for sure, but that doesn't change that if you and a country can't get along, all relations rest on violence. So at the end of the day, that violence needs to be potent and credible.

2 - I read Scaling Force. Loved it. But for me, it just dialed in, ""Stay out of the fight, but know how to fight, and how hard."" Personally, I'm going in the military, so my go-to is going to be buddies with carbines and sidearms and tons of ammo if it goes down that way. If I'm alone, then that was just stupid. Which brings me to number 3.

3 - I am only considering people who are trained, *because the only person I can control is myself.* What Joe does on the other side of the street isn't up to me. As such, I have to consider what works best for me. If I'm going to deal with violence, my priorities are, in decreasing order: 1-have as little violence as possible, 2-have as many competent, armed fighters with me, preferably outnumbering whoever (along with all the other tactical advantages we can get - high ground, air support, etc.), 3-*I* need to be as solid as I can, as far as fighting goes. In my mind, this translates fairly well to the street: stay out of situations that could get real shady real fast, have friends to deal with it, and make sure we're all good at being intimidating (so as not to attract predators) and good at the physical part of violence (to deal with the 3 jackass fratboys who got drunk enough to think they could take on with the fire-team out on the town).",6ueskb
