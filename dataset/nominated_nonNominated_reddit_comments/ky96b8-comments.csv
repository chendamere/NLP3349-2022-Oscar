gjf5cxd,Give me a Sam Cooke biopic starting Leslie Odom Jr.,ky96b8
gjerwyp,"I really should watch more stage adaptations. I loved this one, most importantly the one-on-one interactions between the four main characters. I love this cast, and Kingsley Ben-Adir especially is an amazing Malcolm X, with a level of vulnerability that I've never seen. 

Shoutout to Mad Dog from Riverdale, he was a great Cassius Clay. Movin on up! Haha",ky96b8
gjf3chn,"Wow never seen a thread posed while I was watching the movie.

Everyone did very well in their parts.

That aquantence of Jim Brown talking up his football career, being all chummy then not letting him in the house was depressing but hilarious.",ky96b8
gjfammq,Having “A Change Gonna Come” finish the film was a master stroke,ky96b8
gjfbumf,"I hope I’m not the only one who thought Kingsley Ben-Adir was the best out of the bunch.

I know Leslie Odom Jr. is getting all the love by the critics, but I think Kingsley Ben-Adir packs more of a punch as Malcolm X.

Impressive directorial debut by Regina King.",ky96b8
gjjxdfn,"That opening scene for Jim Brown is the most jarring and effective use of the n-word I’ve ever seen in storytelling. I don’t know why, but I was SO taken aback by the casualness, the incongruity with the previous exchange, and the polite tone.",ky96b8
gjfni1e,"I would just like to add, amongst all the praise and discussion that this movie deservedly receives, that holy shit Aldis Hodge as Jim Brown is gorgeous. Like goddamn he is ridiculously good-looking.",ky96b8
gjexoab,I could've watched ten hours of Sam Cooke & Malcolm X going at it. What's funny is that I agreed with both of them.,ky96b8
gjfpb2d,"I really enjoyed the movie. 

I had never heard of the actor who played Malcolm X, but his performance caught me off guard by both the intensity and vulnerability he brought to the character. You could see his strengths and struggles. Sorry, I'm not really great at describing these sorts of things. I thought all four of the actors were good, but Leslie Odom Jr and Kingsley Bed-Adir were just a little bit better. As a Fringe fan it was also great to see Lance Reddick.

I already knew the history between Cooke and Dylan's ""Blowing in the Wind."" (I even predicted that was the song Malcolm was going to play) But the idea of tying in that history/inspiration of ""A Change is Gonna Come"" and giving it to Malcolm X was brilliant.  

The four of them together was what got me to want to see this movie, but the various times they would split up made for some wonderful scenes and interactions. Great moments between Brown and Clay and then later it would be Brown and Malcom or Cooke and Clay. Cooke and Malcolm's debates/arguments were top notch. 

I was surprised that at the end of the movie they didn't include a note about Sam Cooke's tragic death which would occur less than a year later. It's really sad to think that within two years of that special night the four of them shared, that two of them would be dead. 

Also I knew it was a long shot, but seeing Malcolm take those pictures throughout the movie had me really thinking/hoping we'd see them during the credits.",ky96b8
gjeqvsq,"This was great. Like other stage-to-film adaptations, the pacing can sometimes feel slow during all the talking, but it's full of well-acted, thought-provoking conversations between these notable Black men. Some nice framing and set design (loved that shot of a neon-lit Malcolm looking out of a window toward the end). Kingsley Ben-Adir was excellent and deserves the awards talk he's been getting, and I also really liked Eli Goree. Always happy to see Lance Reddick pop up too.

gjh4m5l,Just want to acknowledge Kemp Powers who wrote the play and screenplay adaptation. Aside from this movie he’s only done one other film. And that is Pixar’s Soul. God Damn,ky96b8
gjn5zwp,No one gonna take about how funny Goree was as Cassius. Him calling his opponent ugly got a good laugh out of me,ky96b8
gjfi24d,Watching the sensational Boston a cappella scene gave me the kind of live-music chills I didn’t even realize I’d been missing so much,ky96b8
gjeu7x1,"Debuting this late after its festival premiere has mostly hobbled this one’s shot at Oscar gold, which is a shame, cause it’s the best movie of the year. In a weaker year, Ben-Adir would be guaranteed for a leading actor nom, but as is, the movie’s probably gonna have to settle for supporting actor for Odom (very deserved) and adapted screenplay

The four leads deliver some of the finest performances of the year, and it’s brought to life by one of the strongest scripts in recent memory. King’s direction is sort of hurt by the staginess inherent to the story, but still very strong. In particular, the early scenes and the moments when they leave the room. When I first saw it during TIFF, I really under-appreciated Hodge’s performance, but I found him to be very crucial to the discussions happening (and also, *really* funny). Goree seems to have channeled Muhammad Ali’s spirit into himself, because he’s like the man himself in almost every regard

Fun fact: Cooke performed “A Change is Gonna Come” in front of an audience only once before his death, but the tape was lost because the studio just sort of destroyed it, not seeing its value. The ending of this film is the closest the world will get to seeing that",ky96b8
gjltyfv,"Watching this reminds me of some conversations me and friends used to have sitting in the dorms at Hampton University. For many of us, including me, this was the first time I’d not been the only black kid in the group. A bunch of black men from different parts of the country with different experiences and different backgrounds trying to figure out for ourselves what’s the way forward for black folks. I met my first black republican in one such discussion. Discussed the Nation of Islam and Farrakhan, etc. Good stuff.",ky96b8
gjf3s23,"Leslie Odom Jr. as Sam Cooke was the highlight — felt like you were watching the real guy at times.

I liked this movie a lot.  It's only January but I can already tell this will be one of my top 10 of the year.  I have no complaints.  It was perfect for me.

If you're recommending this to anyone, tell them not to watch the trailer or read anything about it beforehand.  I watched this movie knowing nothing except the plot description from PrimeVideo and I think it's one of those films that's just better when you know nothing about it going in.

gjhkap8,"I don’t like doing the comparison game but sometimes it’s tough not to. Watching this movie and looking back at Ma Rainey’s you can really see the difference in taking a stage performance and translating it to the big screen. The slight change of scenery gives you a breath of fresh air needed at times. Both movies are very tense at times but where ma Rainey’s stays put, One Night in Miami takes us to the roof or liquor store. I enjoyed Ma Rainey’s so please don’t think this is a knock but I think One Night in Miami shows how to take it to the next level. I could talk for hours about this movie but I’ll reserve. Great movie and highly recommend.",ky96b8

gjn15z4,That scene between Aldis Hodge and Beau Bridges blew me away...did not see that coming...should have...but didn't.,ky96b8
gjz55wb,"In some ways, the film almost bears a strange resemblance to something like *The Breakfast Club*. John Hughes presented a brain, a beauty, a jock, a rebel and a recluse; Regina King presents a boxer, a baller, an artist and an activist. What bound *The Breakfast Club’s* teens together were the various pains and struggles of adolescence, and what binds these men together are the various pains and struggles racial prejudice. The latter obviously far outweighs the former in terms of importance, but I thought it was an interesting comparison.",ky96b8
gjf5e51,"Man, I could have easily watched a 3 hour cut of this movie. The incredibly sharp back and fourth dialog and the pacing was so compelling. Regina  King absolutely killed it. Literally I don’t think there’s anything she can’t do.",ky96b8
gjf4cii,"Absolutely loved this movie! I thought the tightness and anxiety of the stage-like performance was mesmerizing.

Each man delivered such a great adaptation of very real-life characters. And the still-relevant discussion of Black men in America, let alone successful Black men, is vulnerable and nuanced.

Loved the Boston “Chain Gang” scene!",ky96b8

gjf9slr,Regina King and Kemp Powers for the Oscars. What an incredible cast and crew. Beautiful movie,ky96b8
gjk4rba,"80% of this movie is set in a hotel room and I was absolutely riveted the entire time.

The four main actors are all incredible, that it's Leslie Odom Jr actually singing in those scenes is a truly incredible showcase. Kingsley Ben Adir more than holds his own stepping into the shoes of Malcolm X and also Denzel as Malcolm X which for my generation is what any Malcolm X performance is going to be compared to. Eli Goree brings an almost childish joy to Ali. And Aldis Hodge ties everything together by keeping it more under-stated and grounds the film, which isn't easy with everything else around him.

An absolute delight from start to finish.",ky96b8
gjlovug,"I was definitely a fan, it very much comes across to me as a “stage adaptation”. There’s not a whole lot of cinematic flourish from Regina King but she does a gangbusters job with shots that get all four main characters in frame at the same time in a variety of ways.

And those four are all fantastic but I gotta say (I’m spacing on his name) Malcolm X’s actor and Leslie Odom Jr. as Sam Cooke are phenomenal. But all four get moments to shine in what is a very dialogue-driven film.",ky96b8
gjjqf62,OH! this was movie is incredible! I think this movie has been unfairly reviewed like Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. One Night in Miami was captivating. This is a great biopic story with an emotional ride. The actors played their part great. This was good.,ky96b8

gkh9jw8,"Such a GREAT film. It really humanized larger than life figures. Can you imagine them play-fully bullying Malcolm X with his camera, like all close friends do, in real life?  Obviously we have no idea what they talked about when they all met up, but I think its fun to imagine what their convo wouldve been like. Also considering what happened days following, its interesting to just wonder what they talked about. They've HAD to have touched on Muhammed Ali converting (since he announced the morning after) and Malcolm leaving the Nation (considering he left 2 days later). And its fascinating to wonder if they talked about Malcolm's upcoming pilgrimage to Mecca and Ali's future trips to Africa. This is what this film does: it turns our curiosity into a fun re-imagined movie of a true event.",ky96b8

gjort0q,"I hadn’t heard anything about this movie until I saw a commercial yesterday and boy am I glad that I saw that commercial.

I think the highlight for me was Malcom’s recollection of the Boston show. I felt short of breath just watching it, truly an awesome scene. All of the leads were amazing, but one thing I haven’t seen discussed much is Aldis Hodge’s performance as Jim Brown. He doesn’t have any of the outward emotional reaction that the rest get to show. Instead his change is quiet and contained in himself and seeing his press conference at the end felt so powerful. 

I don’t usually like to watch movies again so close to each other, but I’m excited to watch this one again.",ky96b8

I don’t know that it’s as “A++” as the hype goes, but it’s a very, very confident and competent debut for King, all four leads deserve nominations (I find it impossible to say who the standout is. They all stand out), and I felt like I learned a bit, particularly about Malcolm X, that I didn’t know. It’s a fine movie. Probably not gonna blow your hair back or anything, but it hit the spot.",ky96b8

gjg3iws,"Really enjoy this one. Its a little slow at times but the strong script and performances made sure I was engaged the whole way through. It is such a shame that Kingsley Ben-Adir probably won't get an Oscar nom, he was the standout for me.",ky96b8
gjf66j5,"Screenplay was terrific. Acting was terrific (particularly Leslie Odom & Aldis Hodge as Cooke/Brown respectively)

Big issue for me was that the lighting was god awful. No idea what was going on there, but it really took me out of the movie at times (it would randomly get super bright or super dark in the middle of scenes)",ky96b8
gkxh5g7,"This was very obviously filmed theater and it was easy to spot the things they had done in an attempt to open it up (I can't imagine the entire opening pre motel was in the play). 

But cinematic fireworks doesn't seem to be the point. The point is characters and dialogue and the film does a great job with that.

As a white European dude these people aren't quite as mythical to me as I imagine they are to Americans, but it was still very fun and a bit shocking to see them portrayed in such a human manner. I mean, they're teasing and making fun of Malcolm X!

Stellar acting by everyone and special shoutout to Lance Reddick for being so very Lance Reddick.

Also, that famous Southern hospitality complete with lemonade and everything sure is... something.",ky96b8
gk7j7qi,"This film blew my mind. So often in the quarantine era I’ll find myself kinda half paying attention to movies or browsing my phone while watching, but this one held my absolute attention from start to finish. As a white guy, I truly appreciated just hearing the different opinions and viewpoints on the civil rights movement, since the topic is obviously still largely at play in today’s society. It didn’t hold your hand and say “see, we can be equal and unite” (Remember the Titans and Green Book come to mind), but it was a brutally honest look at how even people at the top of their respective crafts experienced life (I know it’s factionalized, but just from a story standpoint). I was captivated on just hearing these men discuss the movement and their roles. I like how none of them told any really specific racist horror stories. It didn’t need that to be impactful, just their thoughts.

While the center point of the film is that brilliantly two-sided argument between Sam and Malcolm, the highlight scene for me was when Jim Brown finally shared his true feelings on how the people who pretend they aren’t racist because they’re not in your face about it and pat themselves on the back for it are worse than stereotypical, borderline caricature racists. Incredibly thought provoking, it reminds me of all those “I’m not racist, I have a black friend” jokes. It helps me realize that there are so many types of experiences and different ways for racism to seep in, and there’s a constant, ongoing battle against it. I recognize that I can’t fully understand these characters’ viewpoints without experiencing similar things myself, but I really appreciate opportunities like this to learn more about it.

Some other highlights: Sam’s performance at the end with the visuals of the other three continuing their own respective lives (I thought it was going to end with showing Malcolm’s murder, but I think ending with his quote was fitting). I love the scene where Sam admits his insecurities about his career and how Dylan’s song affected him, it was the cherry on top of his argument with Malcolm and I think it made Sam the most compelling character, as the whole film up to that point showed he had an anger beneath the surface. And the performances! Really hope we see noms for both Ben-Adir and Odom Jr, their portrayals of the vulnerable side of these larger than life figures were mesmerizing. I can’t wait to watch it again, I feel there is so much more to take in from it

TL;DR - loved it",ky96b8

Must be such a difficult part to play, given how definitive the Denzel Washington movie is.

gob0lz6,"I read all of the comments on here.  I thought the movie was so good I couldn’t get enough of the comments about the movie!

Interesting. The overall feel about the movie starts off less than good. By the time you get to the most recent takes on the film, people are positively raving about the film...

I don’t know. I just thought I’d comment on that.

Oh and...
The one thing about the climate of the conversation in regards to the movie that really sticks out to me is the mention of this being a “black culture cash grab”. I was pretty shocked about that viewpoint. While this is a fabrication of what happened that night and the conversations that could have occurred, I thought the point was one worth making. The point wasn’t to necessarily nail down how these people would have acted with each other that night. I think the point is you have presuppositions about their viewpoints based on having some proof of what their real lives were like through other mediums which, sets the stage for depicting different viewpoints. There’s plenty of people that are superfluously gauging current racial conflicts to have one similar narrative driven particularly by the media (and soaked up by many might I add).  This movie was for people like that (who I admit might not ever watch a move like this). 

My point is the point was not to depict what we think actually happened in some fantasy fanart but to show the nuances of human experience. Notice I didn’t say Black experience. But I think assuming all black folks are going to have a similar take on events occurring right now happens more often than not. And this movie seemed to really flesh out the myriad of ways the Civil Rights Movement affected people and how they perceived the events of the time.",ky96b8
gjk5vur,"I just finished watching this movie on Amazon. What am I missing here? It was a little slow and very predictable. This whole story is mostly fabrication, the only true part is that they were together, that’s it. I also was not pleased with the way they portrayed Malcolm.",ky96b8

The cynic in me just sees this whole thing as a black culture cash grab. I don't want to feel that way. . . .but creating a fictional story about legitimately fantastic, real-life people practically sells itself. It's like those giant-headed kids' books about civil rights figures. No library was not going to buy those.

The story is a complete fantasy? Correct? Except for the fact they all met?

Disclaimer and edit: I am not trying to discredit what was an interesting movie with solid directing. I enjoyed it. I love Sam Cooke and she did him justice! I wish we had more stories about Jim Brown. However, sites like The Guardian already have a few articles up about how this is a ""powder keg"" and other clickbaity shit and that leaves me confused.

Other people are presenting this movie like it does amazing things for ""black people."" I am a little tone-deaf to that I suppose. We've had plenty of great black actors, directors, and writers for decades.

What does the fictional narrative in this art do for our current culture.  I mean...the story is just fantasy.  Help me, a person who generally enjoys zombies, sci-fi, horror, Buffy, Art Brut, kitsch, Troma etc and grew up loving Roger Corman films, understand.",ky96b8

gjnvin6,"Thought it was mediocre drivel. I'm baffled by its critical acclaim.

*One Night in Miami* is too aware of how it's a film adaptation of a stage play that is less about the psychology of its characters than how they can speak to the present moment. What the audience gets is less penetrating insight into Malcolm X, Cassius Clay, Jim Brown, and Sam Cooke than characters who're aware of what their futures hold. Similar to how Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character in *The Dark Knight Rises* is revealed to be named ""Robin,"" *One Night in Miami* telegraphs each character's future in unimaginative ways. Malcolm is not long for the world, but he's meeting with ""a writer"" to get his life down; Cassius Clay is the greatest boxer of all time, but he's soon to become an icon transcending sports; Jim Brown is a football player but he's soon to be an actor; Sam Cooke is about to author ""A Change is Gonna Come."" C'mon, how is this interesting? Each hint at these characters' futures takes a page from the *Dewey Cox* school of biopics.

The greatest sin of the movie is how it lacks actual drama. The drama imposed by King and Powers is from the present. Neither Clay nor Brown are vessels of the present but X and Cooke are, and what uninteresting vessels they are. The performers don't reveal anything new about the past or present to us. Their arguments can be read in the pages of *The New York Times* or on Twitter.

Eli Goree is horrible as Cassius Clay, by the way, a caricature of old video reels and interviews.

Most stage adaptations are terrible. They're usually the main characters talking in a room while the camera sort of just swivels around.

This movie though is a notable exception and a welcome departure. Not just because of the scenes that don't take place in the room, but because of how the plot stays dynamic. They go to the roof at one point. Cooke and Ali make that detour to the liquor store, etc. This is how you do it. Phenomenal movie. Odom's monologue about the Rolling Stones is such a brilliant fuck you to Malcolm. Incredible all around. The Boston Concert is probably my favorite scene of the year. also I had no idea Cookie died IRL 10 months later. Surprised they didn't include a note about that.

I wonder if Leslie Odom Jr. is getting more love because he’s already a big name.",ky96b8
gkxpuha,"I agree that Kingsley was incredible! I do not agree that he was BETTER than Leslie. Leslie needs to drop music for acting imo, he is a force(if he prefers musing then more power to him). Leslie transcends in his ability to act while not talking. 

Kingsley was absolutely incredible as well. When he first appeared on screen i critiqued his lack of physical resemblance to Malcolm(usually not a huge deal but Malcolm had a very powerful physical appearance). I was pleased to forget that thought quickly once Kingsley really got into character. Man, that verbal bout between Cooke and Malcolm was some of the best writing/directing/acting combination on a long time. It played like a prize fight. I hope to see more of Kingsley in the future as well.",ky96b8

gjqhf8h,"I love when movies do this. A lot of movies that explore political/cultural issues are content with having one clear point of view and argument scenes tend to have an obvious ""right"" person and ""wrong"" person. It makes sense if the movie is taking a firm stand on something, and those scenes can totally be entertaining or satisfying, but it's also pretty easy to pick out writer surrogate characters and it can feel condescending if it's not executed well.   


It's rare to see a script that is willing to leave big questions up in the air instead of trying to answer them. It's much more rewarding to have something to actually *think* about or a moral question to ponder rather than have the movie tell you how to feel.",ky96b8

What I find fascinating is something that didn't come up in the movie, but the author surely knew. I'm curious how it was incorporated into the director's and the actors' portrayal:

By the time of the Liston fight, *Sam had already recorded ""A Change is Gonna Come""* but it wouldn't be released for another few days. So, in the reality of the play/movie, Sam knew that Malcolm was about to get what he wanted from him, but didn't even mention it.

It also helps that he absolutely nails Sam Cooke’s singing voice, holy crap. Sent chills down my spine.",ky96b8

I like this movie's Malcolm in spots, but at times he seemed nerdy, awkward, and stumbling. Not to say they can't show him being flustered, but as someone who watched him talk for hours and hours, he's one of the best speakers ever and had a certain charisma, which Denzel nailed - that wasn't the case here. 

I think Malcolm and Brown should've had flashback scenes like Cooke had during his Boston concert. That would've helped flesh them out. When it comes to Malcolm vs Sam, I think Malcolm was proven right since A Change is Gonna Come was and is a huge hit. He wanted his music to have a message sometimes, he wasn't against him making money.
