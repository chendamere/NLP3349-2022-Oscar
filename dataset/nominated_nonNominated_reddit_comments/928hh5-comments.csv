e37btri,"**Official Mini Discussion: First Man IMAX footage**

**Director:** Damien Chazelle

**Description**: We see footage of the Apollo 11 launch but all of it takes place inside the cockpit mostly focused on Armstrong's face and through the windows. At the end there's a few brief shots of Armstrong coming out of the lander, a panoramic view of the lunar surface, and a shot of Armstrong on the moon.",928hh5
e33yep2,"The scene in the catacombs - kicked off by Simon Pegg as a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude - followed by no less than 6 additional consecutive twists, nearly made my head explode. ",928hh5

I laughed pretty hard.",928hh5
e33vrdr,"Kudos to the filmmakers for not taking the easy out and making Julia's husband one of the Apostles or something. As soon as I saw Wes Bentley I thought that's the angle they were going for.

The action scenes were all top notch in this. Especially the fight scenes. That bathroom brawl is probably the best fight scene of the year. Also nice to see Lane getting to fight this time.

Cavill made a good villain. He's got a good steely gaze with those icy blues. And we got to see Superman become Two-Face.

The rest of the cast were reliable as always. Ferguson kicked ass and Ving had a strong scene with her, acting wise. Also did not expect Alec Baldwin getting into a fight with Henry Cavill.

If they keep making M:I films this good, I'll keep watching them until Tom Cruise is aggressively wheeling his wheelchair after the latest villain.

My one little quibble: if Walker was Lark, why almost kill himself with the storm Halo Jump? Unless he was just screwing with Ethan the whole time.",928hh5
e343ki6,Best use of Wolf Blitzer in a movie yet. ,928hh5
e33v0gg,"I like how Ethan didn't actually know how to fly the helicopter - he was just winging it. I just assumed from the trailer and behind the scenes videos that flying helicopters was simply another unexplained skill of Ethan's.

Edit: Also the sound in this movie was fucking awesome, the gunshots in particular. The three scenes that come to mind include the early shootout over the plutonium, when Ethan kills the Widow's men protecting the cop, and Walker pulling out the FN Para in the helicopter. ",928hh5

The writing is incredible, the choreography and cinematography are top notch, every character is well acted and delivers when called upon. I was so jazzed when I left the theater. I want to see it again so very badly. Somehow, it’s the best movie in this series by a long shot, and Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation we’re also fantastic, so that’s really saying something",928hh5

But despite knowing it’s coming, it’s still an amazing moment.  The setup delivers a payoff, and a satisfying one at that.",928hh5

e33vji8,"I could gush about this movie all night but one thing stood out to me. Before Ethan jumps out the window in London, one of the office workers gives him a nod basically saying ""You got this"".

e33v6yj,Bathroom fight scene was way too short. Should've been like 2 hours longer,928hh5
e33uxwl,Thanks Tom Cruise for constantly risking your life for our enjoyment. My god this scratches an itch like few other. ,928hh5
e35dhp6,"Was anyone else pleasantly surprised by the outcome of that bathroom fight? I love how the trailers set that conflict up as Walker's bad ass punch out scene but the movie result is the opponent laying both him and Ethan out. 

Also when Ethan tried dropping the payload on Walker's helicopter but missed terribly. It's those kind of developments that show the good guys aren't always on their A game and only enhances the entire movie experience in my opinion",928hh5

• Walker struck by lightning and the scene that followed

• Bathroom scene

• White Widow’s plan and Ethan’s plan in action 

• Every team member has important moments 

• The helicopter scenes 

• Henry Two-Face and his metal as fuck death

This movie has great pacing, especially for being nearly 2 hours and 30 minutes long. The soundtrack is phenomenal, the tracks Free Fall, Fallout, and The Exchange are favorites. The cinematography was incredible as well, would love to hear from someone who saw this in imax as I saw it the other evening in a standard format theater. ",928hh5
e33wjch,"That one-take (stitched or not) HALO jump set the bar for the rest of the movie's action sequences, and they didn't disappoint. 

Also, I liked how you could tell the helicopter chase was actually filmed instead of CGI because of the camera positions, it usually being mounted somewhere, instead of panning from impossible angles. ",928hh5
e33vfpb,"Even in Mission Impossible, Hawkeye is missing. Where the hell is Jeremy Renner?",928hh5

When we are revealed that Julia is at the location the bombs are set to go off the audience in sync let out a huge gasp.

I enjoyed our time with Cavill being part of the group as well, but he also made a great villain for the remainder of the movie.  Overall a top notch action film.

Edit:  Getting comments about Julia being revealed in the trailer.  Some people might not have watched the trailers, or this was their first MI and from the trailer alone didn’t have the context Julia was Ethan’s wife.  Possibly they were just caught up in the moment.  I don’t know, but it still got gasp either way and was a great moment.",928hh5
e33uiih,"Henry Cavill's mustache fiasco was 100% worth it, this was one of the most action packed movies I've ever seen and it helps so much it has some of the best stuntwork. The Paris chase sequence and the helicopter chase particularly come in mind, I couldn't believe what I was seeing",928hh5

e33yvqk,"I thought they were going to reveal that Cavill was actually a good guy, because they kept making these super obvious hints very early on that he was a bad dude, but nope. They played it totally straight.

That said, I loved this movie. My personal highlight was the fake-out with Benji being Lane.",928hh5

I'm just super disappointed now because I'll never get to see August Walker on my screen again.  Damn, he was a satisfying antagonist.  

""Hope is not a strategy!"" But Ethan sure pulls it off every time.  So much fun.  This movie has earned a 2nd viewing after I rewatch Rogue Nation.",928hh5

That said, the fight choreography in that fight sequence was pretty great. Really that's what I liked most, how well structured and choreographed everything is with the film. Especially the helicopter sequence! It is a visual spectacle, well paced, builds tension well, overall one of the better action films this year.",928hh5

e33uqf2,"I've been saying it for years and this movie just proves it further. Mission Impossible is the best and most consistent action franchise, probably ever. It's obvious they reuse plots and situations but as far as entertainment and just pure adrenaline pumping hype this shit goes so hard. Sorry, I really loved this movie. Here's some of the shit I loved. 

- First off, I think the relationship between Ferguson's character and Hunt is so well done. It's the perfect spy love story. They trust each other totally and don't hold it against one another when they have to act against each other. They protect each other and in the end put the other over their objective. His relationship with his ex wife is done really well, too. I almost cried when she explained that she's happy and feels safe because he's out there at the end. Kind of a great callback to 3, too, since she's been less important in the last two movies. What kind of awesome era are we in when a spy in a spy movie has an ex-wife he's still good friends with? This series has just become so untypical in that sense and I love it.


- Action is just balls to the wall. I think my favorite description of this movie so far from Twitter was, ""Boy Fallout really drags on for the first 45 seconds."" The bathroom fight, the extraction scene, chasing Cavill on rooftop, the underground scene where the CIA surrounds them, the fucking helicopter scene. It's just awesome and even better knowing that Tom Cruise is out there doing it. Getting us those shots. The whole scene where he's hanging from the helicopter on the payload was so awesome yet beautiful. Same with the final fight on the cliffs. 

- The plot is run of the mill for the MI franchise. Despite a couple twists and turns the IMF still gets shut down by the CIA, there's still a mole, and Ethan still has to operate with minimal backup at times, there's a nuclear bomb (or 3). But there's also this layer to the movie that anything might happen. Like when they psyche us out and make us think the bombs went off in Israel. Or in that first scene I really thought Rhames was dead. Or the sunset at the end where I actually for a minute thought they just killed everyone. Like I actually thought that sitting in a summer movie. In the end the good guys win and everyone is intact (minus Baldwin as someone reminded me). But getting there has real stakes, real chance of failure. It feels heavy. 

At the end of the day if this isn't your bag then feel free to move on. But I love these movies and I felt like this one is in the running for the best. Cavill was a solid addition and a fucking unit of a lad to watch fight.  It's a bit long but never boring, the set pieces are beautiful, and the action is on fucking point. 

This is seems like what SPECTRE could have been. I was a little skeptical about going with the same director and continuing the same story (first time for that, every movie has had a diff director and a different female agent until now) but it felt natural. It felt like an obvious evolution. In the last movie Ethan was described as a manifestation of destiny. In this movie, his compassion and mistakes have caused him to scramble to keep the world from falling apart. You hear ""We're working on it"" a lot and it gives the whole thing this great spontaneous and improvisational feel. 

Alright I'm done pleasuring myself to this movie. It wasn't perfect, maybe dragged on a bit and maybe some plot points are a little obvious, but there's so much to love it's hard to linger on that stuff. 9/10",928hh5

In a recent report the studio claimed that almost $70M was paid out by insurance because Cruise broke his ankle which delayed filming for eight weeks.

e35u9xp,[deleted],928hh5
e33vx25,"there is a really interesting parallel between the Mission: Impossible series and the Fast and the Furious series.

the original comes out and is pretty well loved by the target audience. then a sequel (or two in F&F) case that is popular but kinda bad, and the series nearly dies off. then a few years later we get a proper sequel and the series REALLY finds it's footing and gets absolutely amazing.

obviously the M:I series is a lot better made and more high brow than F&F, but this movie feels like their Fast 5. everything in this movie clicked, the movie never slogs down but isn't pure GO GO GO and takes time to take a breath. the Julia being in the camp reveal made everyone gasp, and everything Cruise does in this film is nuts.

e33uiv3,"I loved this movie so much.  This is usually a fucking pull quote cliche but I was \*\*actually\*\* on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. Once this thing starts rolling it never stops.

Mini thoughts:

* More like Mission Impossible Fakeout, right? Any other franchise and the amount of reversals would have been annoying but it’s right at home here and they’re well set up. Total movie magic. It also helps to keep the action moving in this movie, because you never know if an action sequence has actually ended or if it’s just getting started.
* Speaking of movie magic the stunts in this are incredible. Even when they’re doing something that’s likely improbable it feels tangible and real on the screen, and it lends a sense of danger to the characters that feels like a giant middle finger to every other action movie these days.
* Henry Cavill makes for a great villain. He’s a total selfish bastard and I hated him in the best way. Seeing him take a hook to the face is one of the most cathartic villain deaths of all time.
* I liked how this was “dark” but never aggressively so. It never forgets how to have a fun time at the movies.
* I’m not sure how I feel about Lorne Balfe’s score on first viewing. In some moments it worked, but in others it felt like it was trying too hard to be like Hans Zimmer’s work on The Dark Knight and distracted from what was on screen. My thoughts could always change on a rewatch, though.
* Can’t believe I’m saying this but I’m gonna miss Baldwin’s character in these movies. His “Hunt is the living manifestation of destiny” speech in \*Rogue Nation\* was the right balance of class and camp, and they brought a little bit of it back here only to kill him off halfway through. I want more prose heavy government officials.
* Despite liking him in the other movies, Renner’s absence in this isn’t a huge deal. In fact it isn’t much of any deal.
* Does this feel like a “series finale” to anyone else? In addition to it seeming like they can’t possibly top this one (seriously, where do you go from here in terms of generating new thrills?), so much of the movie feels like it’s trying to have the last word on just who Ethan Hunt is, which is funny, considering he doesn’t have much of an actual character to him. But the end where Michelle Monaghan tells him she feels safe because she knows he’ll “always be there” feels like the kind of scene you have when you’re done with it all. I know this is going to be far from the last \*Mission Impossible\* movie (especially if and when this makes a ton of money), but it kind of feels like it could be.

Anyways, this was just a fantastic time at the movies and I can’t wait to see it again with other people for the first time so I can watch their faces melt just like mine did.",928hh5
e37vp4q,Watching Tom Cruise run at full speed is incredibly exhilarating. ,928hh5
e33z9qn,David Ehrlich wasn’t kidding when he said this is the best action movie since Mad Max. I was watching it and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. All of the scenes seemed incredibly tense and McQuarrie did a good job at making it seem like there were actually stakes in the movie. What I seemed to love most though is that McQuarrie and Cruise seemed to know what people loved from Rogue Nation (the theatre scene) and expanded the mood and tenseness of that into one whole movie. I just absolutely love it!!!,928hh5

e36aqut,The introduction of face masks in this series is probably the best thing they've done in making twists come out of left field. Since it's introduction you would think people would catch on when a person is wearing a mask but every single time it gets revealed the whole audience ends up going OH SHIT.,928hh5
e33vh6o,"Honestly might beat out Rogue Nation as the best MI movie for me, definitely the best action movie since Fury Road. The pace is unbelievable from the getgo and it just doesn't let up.  
* The fight scene in the bathroom was fantastic, even minus Henry Cavill's fist-loading sounds.  
* The helicopter chase was freaking insane.  
* Paris chase and the double crossing in the sewers/garage was classic MI  
* It was great to see Rebecca Ferguson return, she was great in the last one  
* Cavill-stache

The only thing I wasn't too keen on was how quick of a bow got tied on the White Widow, I hope she comes back if/when they do the next one. Angela Basset too, maybe she'll be taking over now that Alec Baldwin is out.

There's something so kinetic about his filming style, the framing, the pacing, getting in close with the actors and opening into a wider shot. The man is a magician directing chases. They just grab you by the sack and pull you in.

e33wiju,"I'm confident others will be able to put their thoughts into more eloquent words than my own... because right now I'm just a rambling series of thoughts.

This was easily one of the best action movies I've ever seen and one of the best theater experiences ever. The action set pieces were unbelievable. The fake out in the beginning, the bathroom scene, the chase through Paris, the rooftop chases, the helicopter scenes... were all individually incredible. The Paris motorcycle chase, in particular, might be the best movie chase I've ever seen... and it's immediately one of the all-time chases.

The franchise is really unique because it can build these characters, moments, and this world, without relying on each movie as an essential part of the experience. I haven't seen the first 3 Mission Impossible movies in years, but I can still feel the significance when he sees Julia and when he has to save Luther's life. And I'd say the biggest complaint of the franchise, the formulaic plot, doesn't even matter because it's executed so well. It's the same concept as any superhero, James Bond, Jason Bourne, etc., so it's not really valid unless you want to point out ALL genre cliches or formulas as a criticism.

The characters were excellent and the actors delivered so much in the opportunities given. Ving Rhames, Cruise, Ferguson, Baldwin, and Monaghan, all delivered knockout scenes with very little time or in between large action scenes.. and they resonated too. I'm going to cut myself off because I'm just going to keep typing about how amazing this movie was... oh yeah Henry Cavill played that role exactly as we wanted and expected... great addition.

e3iins0,"I managed to watch this again; things I picked up:

* It's even better on second rewatch. Somehow the emotional beats became more powerful and less cheesy, the twists somehow managed to remain twisty, and the stunts are still fucking incredible. The gunshots are so loud and they make me so happy; they remind me of *Heat* and *Collateral*.

* Luther hands Benji a tenner with his glasses after the Wolf Blitzer scene! Benji won the bet :)

* In the bathroom, when Hunt and Walker are either side of Decoy Lark and waiting for the last pleb to leave the bathroom to knock out the fake Lark, Hunt's entire attention is on the last person to leave; Walker is looking at Lark and Hunt in the mirror. Nice indication of their priorities.

* Ilsa swears when she shoots Decoy Lark to save Hunt; because her first instinct was to save Ethan's life over protecting the fake Lark and acting in her own best interests in order to return to MI6.

* I think a tiny part of the Solomon Lane motif from *Rogue Nation* made it into the movie, heavily Zimmerised but still!!! Might have to listen to the OST at some point to check.

* I was right on first watch!!! There's a fruit and legumes truck in the Paris bike chase that briefly impedes Hunt: the logo on the side shows two hands holding a yellow fruit - and under that, 'De Palma', a call-back to the director of the first *M:I*!",928hh5

Idiots.",928hh5
e34xflo,"This movie definitely deserved its praise. 

Weird thing to point out but because nobody seems to have focused in on this: The sound design of the film is absolutely incredible, along with the score. First of all, the movie knew when and when not to have a score. IIRC the bathroom scene either was mostly or completely scoreless, with grunts, punches, and crashes being the only sound. 

The HALO scene I was afraid it would sacrifice tension for score, but once the lightning struck and the score cut out it was only heavy breathing and rustling as they essentially realtime fall to the ground. 

Two scenes did the opposite, where they cut all noise EXCEPT the score. And it works. The first one is a dream sequence, the second one I believe is when they are in the boat after Hunt jumps into the sewer system thing. 

Every gunshot in the movie has an impact. They made it sound way more real than it had any right to be and this was in a normal theater with a normal sound system. I can't imagine watching this in Dolby. I think this plays into the themes of the movie nicely. Just like our protagonist, the movie knows that there is consequence to every shot. 

Two other places of sound design I want to talk about. First of all, the helicopter blades matching up with the music is amazing. Second of all, when Hunt is running through the path with the pillars, and the sound is from his perspective essentially and you hear every pillar whiz by. 

Also, weirdly enough my theater played zero trailers before this movie. I think they must have somehow forgotten to, because they didn't show the theater introduction either (for Marcus theater people, the part where Greg Marcus welcomes you to the theater, then the ""enjoy our feature presentation"" slide). They can get in trouble for that, right? I mean I didn't mind but there were people walking in 15 minutes late to miss the trailers but instead just missed 15 minutes of the movie. And the end time on the door said 11PM but it ended 10:45PM so I assume there was meant to be 15 minutes of trailers.",928hh5

And for Cruise to be committed to it to the point that ""It needs to look real, so it needs to be me."" Respect to that, man. But it does make me wonder how many of these he has left in him. 

We knew Henry Cavill was the villain from the trailers, but I really enjoyed how they revealed it. They pretty much telegraph it in the first half of the movie (introduce a mystery villain, then introduce this new character who we're not supposed to 100% trust...of course they're the same guy.)  but I loved that the team pretty much puts two and two together the same way the audience does. They're supposed to be a top-notch spy team. They should be able to see a double-cross coming. And they do. Good stuff.

e3bwiik,"As a desk warrior myself, my thoughts go out to the guy at 'IMF' who has to prepare the reel for the 'should you choose to accept it' bit. So many questions:

* this has gotta be prepared by the agent team, as an in-house design department will not be feasible (work on a 'need to know' basis). Do they have a training on 'How to prepare pithy videos for field agents'?

* shit there are 35 suspects.. i can only fit 32 small icons on the page

* When the voice over says that 'we dont know how many are there and who they are', should I just put a big question mark.... no maybe I should go with empty picture frames.. that communicates the idea better

* Is this red and black scheme from the in-house design deck?

e3c0xf1,"Even though I knew Cavil was the ""Bad guy"" I REALLY love how they handled the reveal. With the big argument in the tunnel, the use of masks, and then Cavil revealing who he was to the audience, only to find out that that entire sequence was just a set up to reveal him, and they already knew. It's not so much that the film was predictable, but that the writers knew the audience would be able to figure everything out, so they added fresh twists in HOW everything is played out.

Same with the beginning when you think the bombs had been detonated, and they're in the hospital with Blitzer reporting. Then it's revealed it's not even a hospital at all and Blitzer is Simon Pegg in a mask (probably my favorite use of the masks in the entire franchise). That part really took me by surprise and just perfect execution. 

The film went from really good, to flat-out great once the second half kicked off. That helicopter scene was INSANE and relentless. 

I'm looking forward to seeing this again, just pure action and entertainment from beginning to end, and the stunts and set-pieces were incredible. I really don't know how Cruise hasn't died yet while filming. 

And seriously how are they going to top this? Have Ethan pull off a mission within the space station? I can already see the headline now 'Tom Cruise to film action sequence in space in next M:I installment'.

My favorite part is how many different corners it feels like Ethan gets into just to get out in the most unimaginable way possible. This movie was as much of a wild ride as the rest of the series and I'm so damn happy it exists.  

Wouldn't mind seeing Jeremy Renner make an appearance again though. Also I guess the only predictable part was Cavill's character being the bad guy but I don't mind it because they were able to create great moments around that.",928hh5
e33ul9f,"I watched the movie two days ago and here are my thoughts:

* I cannot pick which Mission: Impossible movie is the best between this movie, Rogue Nation, and Ghost Protocol. I will understand that why some people pick Mission: Impossible – Fallout as the best Mission: Impossible movie in the franchise

* I like that the first few minutes of the movie set the overall tone for the movie, which are full of actions and surprises with the sprinkles of levity

* Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt is what makes this franchise so robust. He just cannot stop, especially with the action scene in the London Building when he jumped from building to building and Helicopter Scene in Kashmir.

* The action scene in London building was so well executed and it is very enjoyable to watch Ethan Hunt parkouring. Plus I like the levity moment when Benji (Simon Pegg) wrongly informed Ethan about the information from the Tablet and when Ethan had to borrow a chair to break a window. Those moments made the second act more even and well rounded

* I like how they Reveal that August Walker (Henry Cavill) is a traitor, they did a reversal and it was so well done and I was in awe

* Speaking of Henry Cavill, I know the mustache is not necessary for the character I am glad that he kept that and Mustache, it added some gravitas and charisma to his character for me, and he become an formidable opponent for Ethan Hunt.

* I like that Ilsa Faust is more rounded this time, she has clear motivation and they added some levity to her character this time. Especially when she chatted with Luther about Ethan's Past and When She teamed up with Benji in the third act.

* The Helicopter Scene was awesome, it is really enjoyable to watch Ethan Climbed that Helicopter and strike the Walker's helicopter. After that, they did an one on one fight plus classic Mission Impossible fight when there is a time limit. The Tension was there and it was the right level of tension

* One thing that I kinda do not like about the movie is White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) is kinda underutilized in this movie. Her resolution in the movie is kinda rushed for my taste but her performance as Female Fatale-ish character was enjoyable. I hope she return for the sequel. Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) is also kinda underutilized but I think we'll see more of her in the franchise since Hunley is dead. I am okay with that because Angela Bassett is a badass

* Overall I really like the movie and for me it is easily the best action movies in recent years. It also one of my favorite Mission Impossible Movies besides Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation. **I gave it 8 - 8.5 out of 10.**

e4jl4uh,"The plot doesn't get enough attention, and as a result it is quite weak, but as a pure action movie this was pretty damn great. So yeah, if you're just looking for pure fun action, watch this film.

I really only have two gripes about this film, but they are big ones:

* I was disappointed with how they pussed out at every single opportunity to do something different for once (nuclear explosions were fake, Ethan killing the police officer was him imagining it, he of course saved the female officer, and naturally no one dies and everyone is fine). If they had actually gone through with some of this shit, the plot and Ethan as a character would be much more interesting to watch.

* Though entertaining, the film is Hollywood jerking off Tom Cruise for two hours. Ethan Hunt is the best agent in the world, but also manages to be an absolute perferct person who never does wrong, and it's infuriating. Him refusing to kill the cops, Donald Trump blessing his face with a touch before he dies, his wife thanking and applauding him for making her go into hiding... at the end I was rolling my eyes so hard I thought I'd go blind. It is VERY apparent that Cruise produced the film.

So yeah, that was my experience. Awesome action, good pacing and pretty good dialogue, but a very thin and unexplored plot that seems like it could have been really cool if elaborated on, villains with no clear motives (Henry Cavill) and a mild feeling of being dirty after having Tom Cruise rub his ego on me for two hours. But fuck if the man isn't an awesome actor with a do-or-die work ethic.

e34b4q9,"I haven’t read much of the comments yet so I may end up repeating sentiments but WOW.

By far the best Mission: Impossible film yet.  Almost every action scene was excellent, and one alone would have made the whole movie excellent, so given there were several of them alone in this film made this one of the most engaging films in the franchise.  While there were many excellent scenes, including the motorcycle chase in Paris at the Arc de Triomphe, the one that took the cake for me was the HALO jump sequence done in one single take.  I didn’t research much on what type of stunts were gonna be done in the film, so I was genuinely stunned watching that sequence for the first time, it was utterly breathtaking.

On a personal note, as a kid born in 1996 named after Ethan Hunt when the first MI film came out, this was my first time seeing a Mission: Impossible movie in theaters, so this was so special to see such an exhilarating film with personal meaning to me.  I can’t wait for more!

My only criticism is I wish Henry Cavill’s character, Walker, didn’t end up being a glorified henchman for Soloman Lane.  I was genuinely more interested in him as a character in the first half when I thought he genuinely suspected and believed Hunt was Lark; it would have been interesting to see him as an anti-hero-like character who would have clashed with Hunt due to their misunderstanding and moral differences.  Even when Walker was revealed as Lark he still didn’t feel like the main villain, and the focus was on Lane.  That said, the story probably had to go that way at the writer’s table, so I’ll take it, and I thought Cavill’s performance was excellent with what he was given.

Also this is kinda random and not intended as a criticism of the film, but am I the only one that has a hard time telling Rebecca Ferguson and Michelle Monaghan's characters apart? Sure most of the time I could easily tell based on the context of the scene and their clothing, but in the scene at the end of the film where Tom Cruise was waking up I actually thought it was Ferguson in frame, not Monaghan.

His moustache was perfection, I really wished that he'd have twirled it while flying on the helicopter cause he was JUST SO DAMN EVIL LOOKING.

I was very disappointed that the 3 nukes didn't actually go off in the holy cities. I was so pumped that they'd start off with such a colossal failure. Ethan essentially sacrificing an unimaginable amount of people to save his friends.

They got me with the Simon Pegg switcheroo in the cell, very clever. Although I did get a bit lost in the tunnel just after that with so many betrayals happening in sequence. I wasn't really sure who was fighting who after it went dark.

I thought that the car/motorbike chase and the helicopter chases went on for too long and did start to drag. Speaking of helicopters, did the CGI on that hook and rocks it was connected to really bother anyone else?

While I liked it, I felt throughout the movie that it was missing something important that the other movies had, I put it down as a lack of 'spy things' but others in the comments have very accurately pointed out that the movie doesn't really have a big heist. There wasn't a Mission Impossible unless you count the failsafe detonators.

While it would have been a bummer ending, I do wish that Hunt didn't get to the detonator on time and the nukes did go off. He'd watch the blast from the cliff face, watching the Fallout from his past mistakes. Although the next movie would be a lot less enjoyable without Benji :(",928hh5

Outside of that minor criticism, best MI yet. One of the behind the scenes featurettes talked about how each movie has that stunt that everyone talks about, but this one has three major ones that just took my breath away. The HALO jump reminded me of my desire to become a skydiving cinematographer and work with magically scenes like that. The fact that Tom literally learned how to fly a helicopter in 2 months for that final chase is still so insane, especially with the 360 spin in the middle there. And of course, the man fucking broke his foot yet powers through to get the take anyway, and it’s THE PERFECT take. Tom’s desire to go above and beyond is something that I will always be in awe of. Honestly at this point, they could release Tom just running for 2.5 hours with no plot, and I’d still see it in IMAX because I know he’d make it interesting and exciting. Best action franchise there is.

Also, Ving Rhames is a phenomenally serviceable actor. I don’t necessarily think he’s hurting, but it would be great if he got more work. Honestly Luther is the backbone of the whole franchise and that’s almost entirely based on Rhames likability. 


Additionally, I wish they took more risks with it. After Infinity War, and having a downer ending, I was kinda hoping Ethan would fail, although as others have pointed out, they do fail constantly and right from the beginning. Basically that sunrise/nuke fake out got me. In any case I enjoyed it quite a bit. ",928hh5

The fights scenes were some of the best I’ve ever seen. Better perhaps than the Bourne movies. Hunt and Walker vs Lark in the bathroom. Ilsa vs Lane. Insanely raw and fast paced.

Also love those transitions with smoke and ilsa head 

When alec Baldwin said Good God during the rant at ethan in London I got a jack Donaghy vibe and expected a lemon right after 

How accurate was the chase scenes for geography in London and Paris. Did they magically end up on another side of town?

There looked to be a really bad shot of Henry Cavill that it didn't look like him during the helicopter chase as he's firing the gun just once. Could have been the hair.

Jesus...I honestly don't know what to say. The whole movie was just amazing. I don't understand how Mquarrie improved this much in a matter of three years. The jump in quality from Rogue Nation to Fallout is insane. 

From the first scene onwards the cinematography stood out to me. One of the best looking movies I've seen. The action is all emaculate too.

I thought Cavill was a bad guy after seeing the trailers, so finding out that he actually was didn't come as much of a surprise. I liked him in this, Simon Pegg was great as usual, and I'm in love with Rebecca Ferguson so I'm biased but I liked her too. Just a great all around entertaining action flick.",928hh5
e38inod,"So, were there actually any Apostles in the movie? Seems like the movie was trying to set them up, but they were barely in the movie (aka sequel hook). Lark wasn't even an apostle, just working with them and Solomon was the leader but he wasn't seen with his minions.

Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe the Apostles was the guys that stole the plutonium, the asian assassin guy,, the henchmen trying to kill Ethan  and Widow in the charity event, and the CIA dudes that shot the other CIA dudes when they were trying to arrest John Lark/Walker, Ethan, Hunley and Benji.",928hh5

Anyways, I wanted to talk about the very ""minor"" romantic subplots of this film. I apologize beforehand, I know this is an action franchise first and foremost. It's just the hopeless romantic in me. So to start...

Damn, I love Julia and Monaghan in general. What happened between her and Ethan is truly sad and heartbreaking I tear up at the tent scene every time (after Ethan's rescue). But I am glad that they were both given closure.

Again, I know that this is not by any means a romance story but it is Ethan's story. That being said...Did anyone else notice how much Ethan and even Ilsa were caressing  each other's faces after Julia left the tent. Like whatever forces preventing them from being something more were suddenly pushed out of the way. In the next, if there is a next, I would be disappointed if there was not something more between them. They have good chemistry formed from a mutual admiration and respect for one another.

And on a final note...It's sad that they just erased Nyah from the universe with Luther's ""he's only been serious about two women"". Last we checked she was waking off into to the Sunset with Ethan. It was a little over the top and over stylized but MI:2 wasn't bad enough to just cut her out. It's still better in my opinion, than most of the crap action films they pump out these days.",928hh5

- Loved the scene with the French cop, it presented Ethan’s good mannered character to do the right thing under tense situations.  
  
- Henry Cavill would make a good Two Face if they wanted to reboot the DCEU/Elseworlds thing.  
  
- I think they intentionally left a loose thread for the Apostles/Syndicate for future movies.  
  
- If Cruise can’t do anymore of these because of insurance/age reasons, it would be the perfect transition for Hunt to pass the leadership role to Faust.  
  
- On a further note; if they bring McQuarrie back for 7, I’d like to see it be a wrap up to this mini-trilogy (Rogue Nation/Fallout/???) between Hunt and Lane or putting away the Apostles/Syndicate.

e50t1b3,"Loved it. My one complaint was Hunt pulling down the helicopter with a tug of the cable inexplicably holding it up. It has thousands of pounds of pressure on it and all it takes is a little pull from Hunt to bring it down? I know it's a movie, but that whole scene took me out of the film for a bit. I was too aware that I was watching a movie, if that makes sense.",928hh5
e5pls7i,"I really liked this film, probably my joint favourite MI film with number 3. When Walker gave over the phone to Sloane me and my brother said it was too obvious for him to be Lark but it turned out it was him.

After 6 movies of this, I’m not sure there is anything left that would be able to shock the audience stuntwise that would be even remotely safe for him to do. I truly fear for his life. ",928hh5
e355za8,"Great movie. Apart from everything everyone already said, I really liked how they showed [Walker was Lark](#spoiler) at the beginning instead of the end.

I just hated the English villain from Rogue Nation. Can't stand the way he speaks and I'm never a fan of those magic needle things that put people to sleep in an instant.

That said. What. A. Fucking. Ride. Absolutely insane last hour and a half coupled with an awesome score and camera angles. It's VERY easy to laugh at Tom Cruise running especially in Fallout, but when the camera moves as it does and showcases (his running speed) the surroundings it's just brilliant to look at.

Really entertaining - I would absolutely see this film again! ",928hh5
e3wts8u,"just saw the movie and my two biggest takeaways is that 1. it's convoluted for the sake of being convoluted. 2. Solome lane stays at the camp and knows/wants to die with his two bombs going off. He **LITERALLY** sees Ethan climbing one of the helicopters to stop the bomb. So Lane knows he either already saw his wife/love or he didn't. But it's irrelevant now that Ethan is trying to stop the bombs. 

So, why didn't he just go into that cabin he was at and trigger the bomb's failsafe himself? 


Fantastic action otherwise.",928hh5

e8uo29m,"That bathroom fight scene is amazing. However, the movie plot, in my opinion, was not that good. I mean, that massive nuclear devastation planned by so called ""Apostles"" in order to bring peace, was not convincing (Unlike science fiction series of ""Watchmen""). If they thought that the CIA was threatening the peace in the world, why would they try to kill billions, instead of trying to infiltrate CIA and slowly carry out their agenda?",928hh5
e33vyyw,"Watch the first trailer for this movie again. There are many scenes that are shown that was completely removed in the film. Marvel has done this before but never to this degree (they usually CG pre-existing scenes).

e3l9fwp,"Watched the movie last week but had my second viewing of the film today. Have to say i was entertained just as much the second time as i was in the first. This movie has very easily become my favourite action film of all time and i find the need to express my appreciation for this film.

First of all, Tom Cruise is probably one of the last, if not the last, of his kind. In a film industry that depends so much on green screen, especially with the rise of superhero movies within the past decade, Cruise does his own stunts, with the film having minimal usage of green screen (as far as i know). The authenticity of each stunt makes it all the more intense, knowing that Cruise actually did that in real life, risking his life to entertain the audience. From doing the HALO jump to climbing up the helicopter and even learning how to pilot a helicopter, Cruise has really stolen the show and impressed me greatly.

Furthermore, the camera work in this movie is unreal. With the cameraman perform the HALO jump as well with a camera on top of his head, it is absolutely insane that they managed to film such a great scene. However, what really impressed me was the camera work in the motorcycle chase scene. I genuinely felt like i was on the motorcycle with Ethan Hunt and Ilsa Faust and I could hear a few gasps in the theatre when Hunt crashed on his bike. My personal favourite scene in the movie was when Ilsa took a shortcut and passed many pillars to catch up to hunt. Camera angles on that scene were perfect and the sound effects felt really genuine i could feel the adrenaline rush.

A small detail i really enjoyed was the lack of music in the bathroom fight scene, that made the fight a lot more epic.

Overall, the film was really great. No complains but a small part of me wished that Hunt didn't manage to pull out the detonator key on time. It would have been interesting to see Hunt deal with the loss of so many loved ones and having to work with old allies back at IMF such as William Brandt in the next film, if there were to be one. But that would have killed far too many main characters than the film can handle so i have nothing against the ending.

TLDR: Great film, strongly recommend others to watch it.",928hh5
e4eqox3,"Watched it today, enjoyed it massively.

1) Knew Walker was the baddie from the beginning, but then again I guess that much was obvious from the trailer

2) Also didn't realize Henry Cavill was so big! I guess when he stands next to Jason Momoa he looks normal but then super tall next to Tom Cruise.

3) Also didn't realize how much Elsa looked like Julia until this movie.

4) I wondered why Walker didn't just throw away the detonator into the mountains/trees. It would have been so much harder to find than keeping the detonator on his person.

5) White Widow kissing Ethan was super random haha. I liked her though. 

6) As someone else mentioned, the soundtrack was amazing!! 

7) I also loved the humour in the movies ""I'M JUMPING OUT OF A WINDOW!!""",928hh5

Now Cavill has played two amoral agents with an American accent, can we let him use his real accent next time he plays a secret agent? Hint, hint....

Speaking of the accent, it's really good isn't it? He doesn't get enough props for how well he can carry accents. Normally actors seem to struggle outside a certain range, but here calm, angry, quiet, top of your voice shouting at 150mph in a open door helicopter? 100% could have been an American actor not having to go through that extra layer.",928hh5

e38v2bp,"Just came back from seeing it again. Just as good the second time around, and it was nice to be able to digest the Ethan/Julia relationship and what exactly happened. I had always assumed they were still married after the 3rd film, and going into the 4th, and they were still together by Rogue Nation. The way it unfolded made sense. Also missed the fact that there was an anonymous donor that tipped Julia and her new Husband to come to the Kashmir area. 

I really enjoyed McQuarrie's use of the score, and when not to use it. That silence really pulled you in at times. 

One big issue I have with the film IS the score. [This Track - The Exchange](https://youtu.be/TXY7EZDUVyY?list=PLohYzz4btpaQ6yn0pXMZEqNxc6MuhVLk3&t=50) SOUNDS way too much like [Gotham's Reckoning from The Dark Knight Rises](https://youtu.be/DR0fl5fgTDg?t=20). It was super intrusive for me. Clearly they used it as a temp track and said just copy that and GOOD ENOUGH. 

The convoy scene had a lot of similar beats as the The Dark Knight scene did too. -semi flip -vehicle rammed into water -convoy diverted onto alternate lower route, etc. 

Still love the movie though. ",928hh5
e392til,"Mission Impossible: Fallout was an absolute blast and one hell of a ride. The action scenes were impeccable, performances and stunts (Does Tom Cruise age?) were top notch, and the storyline had delightful twists and turns. 9.5/10 in my opinion. ",928hh5
e39jxmh,"Haven’t seen anyone mention this, but I loved that when Walker was describing to Sloan about “how many times has Hunt’s government betrayed him, disavowed him, cast him aside? How long before a man like that, has had enough?” he was actually referring to himself. I loved how they subtlety showed that Cavill and Cruise are two sides of the same coin, and likely went through the same experiences but one believed in the system and his principles and continued to protect the world, while the other became jaded by it and wrote the manifesto to upend civilization and the world as we know it.

Hunt coulda become like Walker, and the director uses cinematography and script to show this. In addition to Walker’s conversation with Sloan, another example is in the bathroom scene when you see Hunt walking on one side of the mirror while Walker walks at the same pace on the other side, and you see Hunt’s reflection stalk from left to right but as the mirror ends, you see Hunt’s face disappear and Walker’s face timed perfectly to replace Hunt’s. That man could have been what Hunt became.

There was so much tightness to the script, action, cinematography. What a wonderfully constructed film!",928hh5
e39ky8i,"It seemed like the movie referenced the previous missions:

The fake hospital room scene was similar to the opening of the first movie.

Near the end when Ethan free climbs to get to the trigger it was similar to the opening of the second movie where he is free climbing in the desert.

Obviously they brought back Ethan's wife from the third movie.

The part where Ethan goes on to meet the White widow without a mask is similar to when he meets with the assassin in the fourth cases, assuming that both parties had never met in both movies.

The plot is somewhat of a continuation of the fifth movie's plot.

A lot of praise for the HALO jump, the bathroom fight, and the helicopter scenes. Those will be legendary sequences down the line.

But I’d to give credit to the entire Paris scene when they were getting Lane. The car and motorcycle chase scenes were so fucking ridiculous. This is some of the best cinematographic work I’ve ever seen for an action movie. I felt like I was on the motorcycle with Ethan. Everytime he goes through an intersection I hold my breath. Everytime he turns and sticks his leg out for balance feels so slick. 

Then Rebecca Ferguson on her bike; especially the scene when she’s ZOOMING down that corridor, that literally was just motorcycle porn. I loved it. I loved the story throughout the entire sequence. 

Hats off to the guys behind the camera and their work. The camera work during the HALO jump scene genuinely made me hold my breath as if I was jumping with them.

Not only did this have some of the best practical action you'll see in modern blockbuster filmmaking today, it was also a compelling deconstruction of Ethan Hunt as a character. It put him in psychologically testing situations and the third act tied back to his greatest strength/weakness, prioritising the people he cares most for. Rob Hardy's cinematography is stunning and he creates such an elegant looking movie. All of the supporting characters are great once again and Cavill brings a palpable raw physicality throughout.

Henry Cavill loading his arms before going into beast mode. Great movie, great thrills.

One thing I wasn't crazy about though was the White Widow storyline. I thought the actress was good and totally beautiful, and her character was interesting. She knows people, she has power, she knows how to fight, she has connections. After she upped her price with Ethan and demanded that he capture Isla, she seals the deal with a kiss and then disappears for the rest of the movie.

Mindbogglingly absurd, but also mindbogglingly thrilling.

It's self-aware all the way through and the entire cast is great.  Slight criticism - Michelle Monaghan looks slightly too much like Rebecca Ferguson and that gets a bit confusing.  Vanessa Kirby (from Netflix's The Crown, apparently) plays seriously the sexiest character since Jessica Rabbit.  I spent so much of this film with a massive massive gurning grin on my face, i mean it really is completely absurd, but it's so much fun that you don't care.

We seen him here at the end, flying that helicopter not knowing exactly what to do. He is genuinely worried and vulnerable, not since MI:3 have we seen him like this. Still, he doesn't give up or admit defeat. He figures it out, he finds a way by ramming the helicopter he's in into another helicopter. He survives the crash, survives falling down a cliff in that crashed helicopter as the other helicopter rolls down the mountain and hits him. Fights Walker on the cliff and then on the side of it. Defeats walker by using his rock climbing skills. Now battered, bruised and bloodied; he must climb back up the nearly vertical cliff and remove the key before time runs out.  

Meanwhile his team decides to give him one extra second by cutting the wire at 1 instead of 2.  They cut the wire and the screen goes white...we wait, we wait for victory or we wait for defeat. Most of us know that Ethan will come through, or least we think so. Could this be the end?...

After the white screen, we see him there, hanging on to the cliff with one hand. In the other hand is the detonator and in his mouth, he holds the key and there's not an explosion in sight. I don't know about the rest of you, but this victory, Ethan coming through and doing what he does, it was emotional to me. I had a few tears build up and I said to myself, ""he did it, he fucking did it"" 

Ethan Hunt, who never gives up, never stops until victory is achieved, the living Manifestation of Destiny - My Man!

Great ending, great flick, great hero and great franchise!

e34d7ws,"Spectacular: that's the best way to sum up this film.

- Twice as action-packed compared to Rogue Nation, never missing a beat or wasting a single moment.  Whereas the last two films felt like they went at a steady pace with engaging moments interspersed throughout those films, this one moved fast right from the get-go and didn't let up until the final scene while also giving us thrilling situations left & right.

- Gave us more from supporting characters, especially Luther.  Seeing him tell Ilsa about Julia and  showing him get emotional was effective and almost got to me. Henry Cavill was excellent, of course.  Sadly, Pegg's humor felt a bit hit-or-miss this time around but with so much going on, that gets a pass.

- Almost every frame feels tight and well-shot.  The alternate flash-forward where Hunt breaks bad was was a little chilling & ominous. Plus that beautiful rotating shot of Ethan on top of the tower.

- The stunts were on-point.. My goodness.  The helicopter climb & rock climb to retrieve the detonator scene definitely stood out.

- R.I.P. Hunley, went from being a pain in the ass to a genuine ally. He could've easily berated Hunt for letting the plutonium get stolen but instead he saw through the kind of man Ethan really is, respecting his approach on valuing one man's/individual life over the world and went out a hero.  Very admirable.

e36k0av,"I must admit that my interest in this movie and franchise only came about from Henry Cavill being cast in Fallout. That said, the trailer was fantastic and I heard great things about the franchise as a whole, especially Ghost Protocol. I watched the whole franchise a few weeks back and I became a big fan. The first film was decent, the second was cheesy garbage in both good and bad ways, and then from the third film onward there was just this consistency that really drew me in to the franchise, with Rogue Nation ending up as one of, if not my favourite action movie of all time. That was, until Mission Impossible: Fallout came out.

I like how the movie isn't afraid to start slow, where after a brief exposition of the basic premise we spend time with the characters rather than going into any massive set piece. I was actually starting to get a little worried that we weren't going to get an opening credits sequence, but the way they did it was perfect whilst simultaneously referencing back to the first film (and call backs to the various elements of the entire franchise is a prominent part of Fallout) and then from then onward the movie just doesn't stop, with either new or familiar characters coming in to move the plot in interesting ways, or one action set piece somehow leading into another in such a smooth way and ultimately the movie earns it's runtime and never feels like it overstays it's welcome. In fact I could have easily done with an extra 10 minutes or so of nothing but character moments because the cast has excellent chemistry, especially Cruise and Ferguson. I also would have liked to have seen Henry Cavill with the team in more set pieces like the Paris bathroom fight and the subsequent interactions.

In fact Henry Cavill's character is probably the weakest part of the movie for me because of how predictable they went with the character (this is pretty much completely down to the trailers which were insistent on showing him against Ethan instead of playing up him being the new member of the team). His performance took a while to get going (there was something really off about his scene on the plane with Cruise, like it felt really forced and theatrical which didn't go well with the movie in my opinion) and I think it's fair to say he comes into his own when the truth is revealed and he can really ham it up on screen. On one hand i'm gutted they went the predictable route of making him a villain because he could have been a great supporting character in the franchise but at the same time he did good here and his death was both sad in that I wanted him to return but also satisfying because the character was an arrogant prick who got what he deserved. Also the way he so half heartedly jumped out of the plane with no thought or regard for himself or others felt really weird, like you don't establish a character as badass by having him go ""fuck it lol"" and then flail about in the sky because he's a fucking idiot. That was a major flaw in a menacing character in my opinion.

The action is honestly the best I have ever seen in an action movie before. I never really saw the big deal of doing something practically over the ease of effects until this movie, particularly when he's climbing the helicopter where it just felt so real and made the stakes that much more higher. There were a few gasps in the audience during the jump which ended up breaking his ankle, and I love how they even used the take of him running after he injured himself. May as well make the most of it I suppose. I think if I had to say one thing the movie's action was missing, it would be a slow burner like the opera scene in the last film, but there wasn't really much time or place for one here and what we got was fantastic.

Something that I really loved about the film is how McQuarrie didn't go the easy/cheap way of having Julia, Ilsa and Ethan involved in a love triangle. Straight away they established that Ethan and Julia still care for each other but respect their life decisions and I think Ethan's happiness at Julia saying she's happy was great closure on their storyline whilst also leaving the door open for Ilsa and Ethan to have a happy ending. Genuinely the one thing missing from the movie for me is them kissing at the end but i'm fine waiting for the sequel, in which case they better get together because their chemistry is fantastic, I believe in the character's connection and attraction and unlike a lot of forced romances, this one feels earned.

Overall this movie had pretty much everything I want from an action movie and there is so much here to rewatch it for. Any of the action scenes, the playful interactions, the convoluted but engaging narrative. McQuarrie said how he wanted to try and make it feel like the film was made by a different director and he succeeded, the movie stands on it's own away from Rogue Nation whilst also building on what made that film so great, and as far as i'm concerned this franchise is now as much his as it is Cruise's and with a few story threads clearly left open ended for a sequel, I hope he can come back to complete his trilogy, which may even end up being the finale for the franchise, and if it is, then this franchise has been an absolute pleasure to watch, even if I've only become a fan recently.

Walker was the one caring about the plan being executed, but after the whole helicopter chase and half his face being melted off, he didn't even care abou the detonator and just wanted to kill Ethan.
Lane didn't care much about the plan and only wanted his revenge, but did his best to ensure the detonation of the bombs after he was tied up by Ilsa.",928hh5
e37zujk,"One thing I wanna add is that I like how they're sticking with this convention of previewing key moments from the movie in the opening credits.  I don't know if it's a holdover from the show or what, but something about it is almost wholesomely old-fashioned.  ",928hh5
e3a5gms,"It looks like the deal ""Max"" made with Eugene Kittridge at the end of Mission: Impossible is still going strong. It totally makes sense that White Widow (daughter of ""Max"" from the first film) turned over everyone as she and her brother probably run her mother's organization and are still involved or act as informants for the CIA.",928hh5
e3gl0iz,all i have to say is HOLY FUCK this is the most amazing action movie ive seen in my LIFE,928hh5
e3r4l1l,"I dont get why everyone seem to be so much in love with this instalment of the franchise. I thought it was a decent action movie not much more. There were no breaks in action just constant fighting and loudness. There also was a striking lack of an IMPOSSIBLE MISSION. There was a mission, but there was no planning and execution of any sort. The closest thing we get is the plan to just intercept the motorcade and shoot everyone and even that is not what they end up doing, in stead we get something completely out of left field followed by a 20 minute Paris motorcycle chase around the city.

I really felt like they skipped out on the best part of the franchise which have always been the ""heists"". Breaking into Langley in the original, The Skyscraper in MI2, the Shanghai twin tower Skyscraper in MI3, Burj Khalifa in Ghost Protocol, the security vortex vault in Rogue Nation. These are the parts of the movies that sets them apart from the run of the mill action movie and outside of the ending which was quite distinct from the Bourne movies and more in line with the Mission Impossible ones, this could have almost been a Bourne movie. The heist parts of the missions is also what gives the viewers a break in the middle of the movies, they are tense rather than loud and screaming.

I was a bit disappointed I have to say especially after hearing all the praise the movie got. I did think Cavill made for a good villain tho, I just wished the story and script was a little better.",928hh5
e3upxzt,"During the end credits, the Mission Impossible theme plays. I had just sat for two and a half hours and had guzzled a huge amount of Coke zero. I'm also on meds that make me pee a lot.

eag4qyl,"Not much character building at all in this, unfortunately. Walker is just, there, doing stuff, because. No real motivation given, no depth whatsoever. How about a scene or two fleshing him out a bit, telling us about himself? Not ""uh, he's fighting for a cause, and it's a baaad one"", but actual character building stuff.

I really enjoyed it but there was something off about the entire thing, and I think it was a visual thing. The film felt flat to me for some reason, I enjoyed it but came out of the IMAX thinking I really didn't need to spend the extra cash. 

The sound design was absolutely stellar though, absolutely fucking stellar. 

I also really liked how they kept switching Walker, I knew he was going to be a bad dude but he had many dimensions to him. At first you think he is just going to set Ethan up as a crazy dude. And then you pull the twist that he's an Apostle, then you got the twist with that wasn't Lane and so on. Storywise they kept me on my toes. Fight choreo was the best I think it has been all series too. 

This was my most anticipated blockbuster of the year and even though I didn't love it as much as I wanted to, I'm still incredibly satisfied with it. Another great M:I flick and if this was the end, then I'm happy with it.",928hh5

Plus the whole two-face ""reveal.""

Not complaining at all. Those are good things to get inspiration from.

But there were some great shots in this. I hope the way they didn't use shaky cam will start a new trend again of not using it. Made it easier to see all the action. Really liked the jumping out of the airplane shot. The music builds and then just sorta stops and you know what's about to happen.",928hh5

Other than that, super solid and Tom Cruise is a crazy person.  Fallout and Ghost Protocol are my two favourites.  I think I have to let it simmer more but I think this entry just might be the best in the series.

That being said, the movie definitely lives up to it's hype. There were way too many scenes in the movie where I kept going "" how could they have shot that, that's brilliant"". I love the plot as well, it was tightly written and didn't treat the audience as idiots.

I just had one concern though. During publicity of the movie, they always referred to Henry Cavill as the villain of the movie. Why did they do that? Granted the writers weren't trying really hard to conceal the fact that he's the villain. ( The scene early on when he passes the phone with an unbroken screen to Angela basset and basically starts creating a narrative that Ethan is the villain). I really believe that there could have been some element of surprise to viewers if they always claimed that Henry Cavill is Ethan's partner.

Then again, I guess the Moustache gives it away.",928hh5
e37713g,"Basically as expected.

The sound editing was fantastic, and the set pieces were all great. Vanessa Kirby stole her scenes as the White Widow absolutely fantastically, though I wasn't a fan of Angela Bassett's performance.

The only major gripe I have about this film is how terribly introduced most of the characters were to each scene. It's time for X to appear, so they do. There's no continuation shots linking where people are going. It seems like a recent trend in action films - characters come and go as they are needed for scenes, and continuity isn't nearly as important.

I would have also liked to see Lark been someone present throughout the MI films, or recent ones. Introducing a shadow villain and then introducing a new character made for a very underwhelming reveal later on. I think, with some foresight, Alec Baldwin would have made for a very interesting flip as Lark. Wouldn't that have been something?",928hh5

e3a3ze9,Great film was a wild ride. Definitely considering seeing it again. My only gripe is that [this scene](https://youtu.be/wb49-oV0F78?t=22) was never in the film. It was so beautiful in the trailer.,928hh5
e3anzgx,"You know, this is probably the best action movie out this year. The scenes were chaotic but there weren't a lot of camera cuts making it easy to follow.

Even though the trailer gives a basic outline of the entire movie, there were still plot points in the film that still surprised me. 

[I do have to say that I'm sad to see Baldwin exit the stage here. I actually liked him a lot in this franchise, and his ending fight scene was both funny and sad at the same time.](#spoiler)

[Some reason I was hoping for a misdirect from the trailers with Cavill being a good guy. And then I was hoping that he'd be a reoccurring villain. Because if there is another, which there might not be, I'd like to see him again in this franchise. But alas, he died a pretty gruesome death.](#spoiler)

[Also, I found it funny that after Cavill reloads his arms in the bathroom scene, I was expecting him to kick ass. It caught me by surprise to see him getting his ass kicked very shortly after that intimidating walk.](#spoiler)

[Anyways, as I said earlier, this really did feel like the final MI movie. Granted if this does like $500M or more, than it's probably hard for Paramount, who hasn't had any good franchises recently, to hang it up. It really did feel like a send off for Cruise (as well as for Monaghan, who has been a huge part of Hunt's story). Something about this film felt like it leads to the fact that Ethan Hunt can never be at peace, he's accepted that fact, so while there may be more bad guys to defeat, it just won't be onscreen anymore.](#spoiler)

[One last note, if they continue with MI movies, I feel like it needs Cruise to headline it, I don't think the franchise has quite the same appeal of even Ferguson being the main star.  Even though she did a really good job in this one. Though who knows, James Bond has switched actors every so often and they all do pretty well.](#spoiler)",928hh5

The stunts are on another level, loud powerful, and technically perfect.  I just can't say enough good things about Fallout.  Is it going to be the last MI film?

e37up2c,"I probably would have skipped this in theatres and waited for it to hit digital streaming but the review that made me buy a ticket ASAP was Chris Stuckman calling it the best action movie since Mad Max Fury Road.

Movie totally deserves to make a billion plus dollars.",928hh5
e35av9u,"Oh this movie was soooo good. I really don't have much bad to say about it. Maybe the opening mission briefing was overly explanatory? The movie was about two and a half hours, but it didn't feel like it because of how well paced it was. I like that there were personal stakes for Ethan and of course the higher stakes of nuclear bombs. What's interesting about this movie was it felt like a direct sequel to Rogue Nation due to the prominence of Ilsa and Solomon's roles in the story.

The action scenes in this movie are unrivaled with all of them being standout. 

* The thunderstrike part during the HALO jump. Not only was it a cool sequence, but it was a great way to introduce how of much an ass Walker was. 
* Bathroom brawl - What the hell? Who would have thought a random goon could take on both Ethan Hunt and Walker (even when Walker tried to reload his fists). This definitely came out of nowhere and the choreography was great. Little bit of trivia, I looked up Liang Yang and he was the ""TRAITOR!"" stormtrooper in Force Awakens. 
* French car chase - This scene alone will earn Fallout a nomination in sound editing. The whooshing sound as Ilsa drove past the pillars and the car engines revving, skidding, etc. Utterly spectacular. The chase is just choreographed well with how Ethan loses all the cops. 
* Ethan rooftop run - Holy shit. This topped the China sprinting scene in in MI3. Ethan was sprinting and jumping over rooftops like a mad man. He's not even tired from doing all of that along with hanging onto an elevator at the end. Ethan Hunt's cardio is unmatched. Makes me wonder how much break time 56 year-old Tom Cruise had between the runs. 
* Underground gun fight - Again sound design is amazing here with the oomph of each gun shot. The standout in this scene was Alec Baldwin getting in on the action with some cool hand to hand combat before being stabbed by evil mustache man. 
* Climax - Holy shit was there a lot going on here. What I love about this sequence was how important everyone's role was not just Ethan. Ethan was helicopter dueling with Walker, Benji and Luthor disarming bombs, and Ilsa having her personal fight with Solomon. Even Julia gets in on the action with the disarming. I liked that Ethan relied on smarts to defeat Walker. Walker was younger and a big guy.

Moreover what made the action so good was the fact it was all discernible. There weren't any shaky cams, rapid cuts, or extreme close ups so much that you couldn't understand what was on happening on screen. The direction and cinematography deserve all the credit. 

I heavily implore anyone to check this movie out in (real) IMAX or Dolby Cinema. The audio and visuals in this was top notch and Dolby Atmos enhance all the action sequences so much. 

Is Huntley really dead by the way? Kept expecting him to turn on at the end, but I guess not. Someone mentioned that he doesn't mind if this were the last MI film and in a way I agree because this would end the series on a very high note, while wrapping some things like Julia and Ethan's relationship. ",928hh5
e36xux0,"I have seen a ton of people saying ""best action since Fury Road"" and I completely agree. Does Fallout have any hope of Oscar success like Fury Road did? Or is that ridiculous? I mean from a technical perspective more than any of the traditional big awards.",928hh5

e37riyf,"HOLY FUCK. Saw it opening weekend after hearing comparisons to Mad Max: Fury Road in levels of sheer awesomeness. DID NOT DISAPPOINT. Edge of seat the entire movie. While it was 2 1/2 hours I swear to god it felt like 30 minutes had only passed by when it ended.

But, can we please talk about the scene when Michelle Monaghan first sees Tom Cruise at the medical site. Her acting in this scene brought me to tears. Just the sheer anguish on her face from being happy to see him, to knowing he could only be there for awful reasons, to her having to try to hide all of this from her husband.

Also, the last stunt is a helicopter stunt.

**edit**: Also, the method of mission-delivery in M:I6 was via Homer's *Odyssey*. *Odyssey* is about this one incredible dude who gets cursed with horrible bad luck, goes through all manner of insanity and comes up with all kinds of hare-brained schemes to get him and his crew safely home to Ithaca.

I expected it to be good, but it was AMAZING!",928hh5
e3pda5p,"I must say, I went into this film expecting to love it - I'm a quiet fan of the MI series and of Tom Cruise's particular brand of uncompromising authenticity, and Fallout has been getting pretty consistently excellent reviews - but ultimately I was just entertained for the runtime rather than blown away during it

There's a really, really well done fake-out early on in the plot ([the 'successful' detonation of the three nukes](#spoiler)) that serves as a great example of the directorial sleight of hand so typical of Mission Impossible series, but I really wish the script had been willing to go down that road for real - without wishing to spoil things for those brave enough to venture here ahead of seeing the film, it would have been a much different and arguably more interesting picture if the plot had revolved around those dire consequences and how Ethan Hunt and co go about managing and rectifying such a dire situation for the 2+ hours

Henry Cavill is on top Man From U.N.C.L.E form (seriously, if you haven't seen that movie go watch it - it's a real gem with a wonderfully cocky performance from Cavill that makes me sure he would have been a great James Bond), but his character is really quite perfunctory, and functions mostly to set up a 'twist' that literally everyone will see coming from the moment he's introduced in a hail of dry expositional dialogue. Considering how much of the plot relies on this revelation, it comes off as something of a damp squib towards the end of an otherwise engaging second act when everything should be popping ready for the third act climax

Car chases make up the bulk of the main stunt sequences in the film, which are all competent enough - but even knowing that that's really Tom Cruise doing the driving/biking can't help with the sense of apathy that comes with having seen countless similar car chases in countless similar movies, shot in a similarly competent fashion

The helicopter sequence is genuinely fantastic though, and there's a wonderful touch in that, for possibly the first time in the franchise, there's something that Hunt isn't already a master of - he doesn't actually know how to fly a helicopter when he takes over the controls, and so we get some funny moments while he's working out what does what (and which warning lights are actually bad) 

Fallout is a very, very solid offering to a pretty finely tuned franchise - that said, there's a lot of clunky exposition that could have been handled much better, and the plot is just too far onto the formulaic-by-way-of-predictable scale for my liking - especially noticeable when there are at least two clever fake-outs that would have been much more interesting and inventive than the actual reveal

Firm 7 out of 10 - pretty darn good, but nothing spectacularly groundbreaking",928hh5
e33vqvn,"I loved the music in this. It completely takes over some scenes. There'd be absolutely no dialogue then the music kicks in. Not in a Insterstellar ***BWAAAMMMMM*** way, it's a lot better/delicate than that. Felt nice to see/hear in a $250M+ huge tentpole film.

I don't know how they manage to keep the quality so consistent. Bravo.

Side note: did anyone else notice that *quite* a few shots / scenes from trailers were missing? Off the top of my head: Ethan doesn't almost fly his helicopter into a truck; the IMF team doesn't stop by a car with murdered passengers in Kashmir; Ving Rhames doesn't say ""he's an assassin"", instead Alec Baldwin delivers that (or a similar) line in a different manner, etc etc. The dialogue ""this is a bad idea"" - ""when is it ever a good one, honestly?"" between Rhames and Pegg didn't happen either, iirc.

A few qualms I will say I had with this was I felt like it was lacking some of the more exciting stunt pieces that we saw in previous films. I don’t think anything here matched the Burj Khalifa scene or Ethan flying on the side of the plane from the last movie. It also lacked some of the more small scale but really exciting moments like the underwater scene from a few movies back, or the invisible screen Simon Pegg made.

I feel like a lot of this movie was ‘look at all the danger we are in they finally caught us...AHA! Gotcha! We had a fake mask on the whole time!’ Which is cool.

But then, after the break goes “wrong” and Ethan-as-Lark is conferring with the White Widow next to the river, with Notre Dame in the background, she says: now you have to get Ilsa, too. And if you don’t — I’ll sell the cores to the highest bidder.

Even though it is to be expected, I was so anxious internally because they had to make it IN that 1 second mark. To me it's like playing darts; making a score is good, but a bullseye is super good and you've been getting bullseyes. But now, you HAVE TO get a bullseye or else the world dies.

My only 'complaint' is that Walker didn't feel like much of a threatening/menacing villain; he seemed very human.

He didn't feel like a superhuman (hah) villain. 

Favourite part has got to be after Ilsa cuts Benji from the rope and he 'plomps' down to the floor - the whole cinema grew silent, only to burst out laughing in relief a second later when Benji gasps for air. You could feel the release of tension in the entire cinema. ",928hh5

Anyway, the writing has only really gotten better since the second film (easily the weakest entry but I still enjoy it for what it is). This one's got a good script that expands the series' canvas while delving much deeper into character. It's anchored by a great supporting cast and some of the most satisfying set pieces the series has to offer (and that's saying something). I'll be first in line for the seventh film, assuming Tom is game (he's shown no signs of slowing down). I'd see an Ilsa Faust spinoff too.",928hh5

I was a bit confused on a lot of it the first time but it all (mostly) made sense the second time. But I don't get why Walker had to go through anyone if the Apostles already have it??? What am I missing? Why is he meeting White Rose? Why is there even a middle man? Was it just to frame Hunt? But even that doesn't make sense because there is no direct connection between Ethan and the Apostles. If he wanted to do that then have one of them literally say it was Ethan they met with. Instead its a vague paper trail but as the film itself showed no one even bought it. The second he tried to set him up with Sloan they all figured out in minutes it wasn't true. 

So I still love the movie but yeah this is really bothering me now lol. It would've worked better if they ALWAYS knew Walker was Lark and playing him to get the nukes instead of him showing his hand when there was ZERO reason to. Or am I missing something?",928hh5

e3odcwu,"For my money, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the pinnacle of the franchise and edges out its predecessors with the series's best entry in a franchise that's (generally) gotten better as it's went on.

The entire cast did a fantastic job. Tom Cruise is great as Ethan Hunt as always, Sean Harris is seriously challenging Philip Seymour Hoffman as best villain of the series with his portrayal of Solomon Lane, and Henry Cavill is a very welcome addition who has great chemistry with Cruise.

The stunts do not disappoint. The HALO jump was incredible, as was the entire chase sequence in Paris. Then there's the helicopter sequence at the end. The entire movie is nuts - and it doesn't let up. I really loved it.

We get the series's best plot in Fallout as well. A returning villain, plenty of twists and turns, a major character death, this movie has the stakes and packs a punch.

Christopher McQuarrie returns as the director, and delivers more of the same goodness from Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation. While I still prefer Brad Bird's style overall, I think Christopher McQuarrie bests himself and tops his work in the prior film. The bathroom sequence and the motorcycle chase scene in particular have some fantastic shots.

I wasn't sure I'd like Fallout as much as most people. The hype was real. I'm glad to say that it is well-deserved, however. Mission: Impossible - Fallout delivers the series' best entry with thrilling action, a twist-ridden plot, and Tom Cruise doing insane stunts. Everything's amped up in this film.

e36k6bc,Best Tom Cruise movie since Edge of Tommorrow. ,928hh5
e36w7sw,"Seriously, the best movie in the franchise. The law of diminishing returns but in reverse for these movies because each movie gets better and better  
  
Tom Cruise at 56 years old is still killing it as Ethan Hunt. I really did enjoy all the crazy shit he did in the movie from the motorcycle chase, jumping off buildings, climbing on helicopters, helicopter chases...Also liked they sprinkled in the right amount of angst with him in terms of dealing with the fact he did not kill Lane, conflicted feelings about Ilsa, Julia's well-being, the choice he made to save Luther and not go for the case.  
  
Christopher McQuarrie, I gotta say, I really can't wait to see whatever film he directs next. I think he took the great work Brad Bird did in 'Ghost Protocol' and took it even way further. He knows how to really shoot action sequences and was able to pace the film well to have those moments of exposition, levity and time for the audience to breath a bit. His scripts for this and ""Rogue Nation"" are also well structured especially getting to those action scenes.   
  
Supporting cast was really strong. I really liked the contrast of August (Physical, brute wants to beat you to death... no games) and Lane (Cunning, wants you to suffer before you die). They gave Luther more to do than being a dude in the van and made him more of the emotional center with Ethan. Pegg really has evolved Benji into a great field agent while bringing in those moments of laughter especially with the mask reveal. Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson is so stunning) and how they brought her back because of the blowback with Lane and clearly her feelings for Ethan. Also I really hope White Widow comes back too, wow gorgeous and you get the same chemistry Hunt had with her mom in the first movie. My one slight thing though I understand in terms of the bigger picture because you needed to be convince Walker was a pure threat, I wish Hunley lived, I liked the character and wasn't really feeling Sloane. I also liked how they gave closure to Ethan and Julia. 
  
IMO best part of the film was the fight sequence, I loved how Fake Lark beat the shit out of Walker/Hunt until Ilsa ended it

Seeing Tom Cruise say “suit up” to Superman and then saving his life midair was something too.

Great movie. Rogue nation is still my favorite. I never know what people talk about when they say “edge of your seat” but there was a lot of that when watching. This has elements of all of the MI movies and still managed to out impossible them. Feeling the fatigue of where it all can go from here and kinda wish he had died honestly. But it’s been a ride

e3lygmv,"Only seen the first film in the series and haven't seen any of the trailers so I went into this about as blind as you can be.

Most of the movie and the backstory was pretty easy to glean from what gets said, with the exception of Rebecca Ferguson's character. It didn't feel too much like it was hitting you on the head with the backstory but maybe that's different for people who have seen the other films.

Set pieces were utterly spectacular and the second half of the movie was paced really well. First third or so felt a bit crap, seemed like they knew what they wanted the majority of the movie to be about (Paris, London, Kashmir set pieces) so they just rushed through the buildup to that which is fine because those three destinations ended up being really fucking enjoyable.

Villain's motives are pretty cheesy and I feel like they could have put a bit more work into making those deliveries come across a bit better. But that's a minor gripe.

Only other gripe I had was that the plot seems to be continuing the trend of big blockbusters to just get more and more convoluted with like 10 backstabbings/betrayals in the film. Cavill meeting with the woman from the CIA on that rooftop was done quite well with him giving the not-smashed phone to her but then the bit in the catacombs was really over the top.",928hh5

Happy to report that this movie is one of the few exceptions.  That bathroom fight with the Asian dude was incredible and probably one of the best fight scenes I've seen on the big screen.  

It's also surprisingly well shot for this type of movie.  The shot of the motorcycle driving between the columns is one I won't soon forget.  Good movie.  Highly recommended.

I see no reason why they needed Hunt to free Lane; they came up with the plan to free him and could’ve executed it themselves.

Also in the nightclub scene I was confused as to why the apostles were trying to kill “Lark” (Hunt) and the broker when the plan was to have Hunt free Lane and for White Widow to broker the deal.

Also there was a line of dialogue I missed. White Widow was revealed to be working with the CIA. What was Lane’s original plan had Hunt delivered him to White Widow? The Apostles would’ve killed everybody?

And a nitpick but, was the only way to enter the nightclub really by HALO jump?

-Cruise, my man, you're insanse and that's a compliment in every sense of the word.

-The camera work. Phenomenal and extremely entertaining scenes from start to finish. It helped that TC did his own stunts

- the score. It worked when it did (even the lack of during the bathroom scene was lovely) and other times I didn't notice it because so much was going on.

-action sequences. You know. You know. You know (though some parts I expected from the trailer we're severely lacking, bathroom scene delivered HARD)

-Cavill as the baddie (Stache was worth it. And I like the dude. Played it well)

- The nods/homages to the previous movies and the TV show! (Didn't notice the max connection but lots of shots/actions/themes similar to past movies will jump out when you marathon this movie)

-literally most of the stuff, Including set up for future franchises)


The Hol(e)y Shit

- Plot holes. I get we have them in all the movies but this one attempted to pack more plot and it didn't always work. Including ""twists"" and showing it as it is. 

-Bad guy reveal. I know this is probably part of previous part but the he may not or he will seemed unnecessary. Should've stuck to one or the other from the beginning (like Jon Voight in mi1 or Hoffman from mi3)

-the length of some action blocks. The whole chase in Paris and the helicopter chase are essentially what the movie boils down too. But some part of it felt like it was longer than it needed to be (helicopter slide down the perfectly created pit, the amount of running, by God)

- the trailer. I think this was the worst part because between what they showed and the movie I was able to string together most of it and knowing what is coming next (broadly) detracted a lot from my experience of this. Wish I had gone in blind. IF YOU READ THIS, PLEASE GO WITHOUT WATCHING THE TRAILER.



Chris McQuarrie did Jack Reacher 1 and MI5 and now MI6. All of them have been solid movies IMO and I think credit where it's due to the whole team. With Baldwin dead(?) I think this juncture to have Angela Bassett or even Tom Cruise to semi retire from the field and be secretary but still accompany on some missions would be a great next step for the franchise (do some stunts but now we know how much they take a toll on Agents)

1. So as I understand it, The Apostles (working with Lark/Walker) want two things: to get plutonium to make the bombs, and to free their leader, Lane.

Their plan from there was to act like they were setting up a deal for Lark to get the plutonium from them, knowing that White Widow (who was working with the CIA to capture Lane, Walker, and the plutonium) would lead them to Lane, who they could take along with the plutonium. SO, they used a fake Lark to approach White Widow so Walker wouldn't be exposed. My question: Why, then, did the Apostles try to kill ""Lark or whoever was meeting with White Widow"" and White Widow? Didn't they need her to lead them to Lane? And wouldn't they recognize Walker/Lane? And for all they know the fake Lark was the real Lark, who they were working with?????
2. After Ethan chases Walker to the Tate, Walker admits he can't kill Ethan until he has the plutonium... why? And when/where did Walker/the apostles get the plutonium? Because as far as I remember, they never used Ethan to get it after that.
3. Basically, I understand Walker being Lark and wanting to bomb everything, I understand Lane wanting Ethan to suffer by killing Julia, and I mostly understand the CIA not trusting Ethan but then wanting to sort everything out and giving Lane to MI6 bc Ethan saved everyone.

Just when you think the tension is at its limit, it goes even beyond that adding more and more factors to make you even more tense than before.

e5944da,I think there are many good theories here but let me put some twist of my own and maybe people can chime in.  When Lark didn't kill Ethan at the elevator was he referring to one plutonium that was given in good faith by the White widow's?

Though, on the other hand, I also understand that he's basically a superhero and showing that side of it might go against the theme of him just hurling himself full-bore into these situations.   Maybe they want to avoid the whole, 'I'm getting to old for this shit' trope and just continue to have him be a super human who is fazed by nothing and will never be too old for a mission.",928hh5
e362oa2,"Man, this was incredible. Watched this last night after a recent rewatch of all the films. It's amazing how they keep outdoing themselves, to the point where I'm worried for what's probably going to be an inevitable next film. Even if somebody tries to argue that they've made the same film six times, how can anyone complain when they're this good? Obviously the action was excellent - the anxiety inducing HALO jump, the TDK-esque armored truck and motorcycle sequence, the helicopter ramming - but I'm glad to see that this particular brand of *story-driven* action films hasn't died out. Everything felt like it had a logical place in the story, and I'm particularly impressed knowing they had to improvise a bit and planned the film around the set pieces (not unlike TDK as well). 

Loved how dense the narrative was with serious stakes and a sense of tension that carried throughout the entire film. It was ""this time, it's *personal*"" done well in an unironic sense. From the word go, you were in Ethan's head space - what an opening between the nightmare and the hospital room fake-out - and as the fuck-ups piled up, I really began to wonder if this mission was going to be impossible (that flash at the end...). It was fascinating to see Ethan's choices complicating things further and further until the situation was totally down to the wire - everything satisfyingly tied back into that central theme of his core need to save even a single life at any cost, with an emotionally resonant resolution conveying what he's sacrificed to do just that and to perform this whole job in general in the scene at the end with his wife. 

And shout-out to Ving Rhames for his performance in that talk with Ilsa and with the ""my man"" at the end (;_;). Also, Lorne Balfe did an expectedly great job on the soundtrack, I'm glad to see he's getting to do bigger stuff after hearing his underrated soundtrack on Assassin's Creed 3 from a little while back (I may or may not be listening to it as I type this, and it may or may not be entering the rotation with ACIII tracks like Fight Club).

1. Heavy TDK influences in first half, with the score and the convoy diversion.
2. Benji fighting for his life with the rope.... ugh. Hard to watch even though we know it will work out. Those make me cringe. Great work.
3. Opening fake out with Wolf was awesome. 
4. HALO jump, that fucking bathroom scene, entire convoy scene (and imagined one), bike chase through Paris, underground SWAT fight and the bajilion twists, Tom Cruise running across London, and the helicopter scene and that whole Kashmir sequence were ALL executed brilliantly. McQuarrie knows how to pace a film. Basically just listed the film but that's how good it was.
5. Don't know if this was intentional, but setting up Walker as the villain in the first trailer, then backing away from it in the second trailer, then having him be a good guy in the first half of the movie, then having him be an actual bad guy was kinda great.

Toward the beginning, when Hunley is briefing Hunt on Lane and the “Apostles”, there is a shot of a b/w photo of said Apostles with everyone’s eyes black barred out. One of the men in the photo is very obviously Cavill, with his large build and mustache. It gave away the ending very early on in the film, or rather, let the audience know that that twist will be coming. This, in no way, was a negative thing for me. I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Like what’s been said already, great cinematography, score, cast, acting, stunts and subtle special effects.

A bit too inconsistent for my taste. Even though this felt a lot like TDKR, he didn't have the presences of Bane. Not blaming him for his acting. It was mostly the writing of his character.",928hh5
e39zcex,"It has the best ""raw"" action from any of the MI movies. Especially the bathroom fight, and the chase through France. It felt like it had the Christoper McQuarrie tone, but on steroids. Also, it felt very McQuarrie-like to have scenes in which Ethan Hunt is participating in his very own ""No Russian"" scenario where he is with the bad guys and he is force to participate killing innocent people. But the movie kinda has it both ways by making it a dream sequence or Ethan Hunt saving the good person at the very last moment and still manages to not blow his cover.

I mean, you're telling me that after that underground road sequence where Hunt purposely botches it and gets the men arrested, the White Widow and her brother completely BUY Ethan/John Lark's explanation and proceed to work with him again?

But the main thing that I keep thinking about is that they've painted themselves into a corner since MI4 Ghost Protocol.  The bad guys have the organization and skill of first-world spies (because they are spies from first-world countries), but they are ideological zealots on a level that is hard to believe. In MI 4, 5 and 6, the bad guys want to accomplish the same thing for almost-exactly the same reasons. And the movies keep on escalating the complexity of the bad guy's organization. It requires both the British and the American intelligence agencies to have so many double-agents infiltrating them. Which leads to alot of convoluted plots in order to explain this complexity. I don't believe they can continue expanding the nature of the enemy in future sequels. They have to scale down at some point.",928hh5

e3z2lvz,"So as much as I loved the film, I have a theory that the last 3 Mission movies should have swapped out the 2nd and 3rd acts.

MI4: The entire Dubai sequence would have been the perfect finale with some climactic chase\fight perhaps involving the Burj Dubai, as opposed to that cartoony car parking\gala finale.

MI5: Morocco, with the bike chase and underwater scene as the 2nd act could have been switched off with Act 3, which is a more downbeat (obviously, considering they redid the whole ending) 3rd act: it feels like literally everything after the motorcycle chase (Starting with Ethan asking Benji if he made a copy of that disc) was rewritten last minute. 

MI6: The Solomon Lane escape, chase through Paris, and chasing Walker through the streets of London, now that finale was more intense and thrilling than the over the top helicopter chase, which was pretty fun and exiting to watch, but just a TAD bit too over the top.


Again, to be clear, these are all great movies and the finales work, but it's clear that the last couple of movies use Act 2 as their big action showcase. 

But another pattern I noticed is, all of these Act 3's I mentioned are in very secluded, private, small, contained areas. Act 2's all tend to be in the public: in streets, in metropolitan areas, a wide traffic jam, etc. (The exception of course is Skyfall, which is more of a cowboy mano a mano style where nobody is too overpowered IMO)

IMO there's something kinda less thrilling\suspenseful when a final battle is just between 2 people and empty space; makes the whole thing less suspenseful. For instance, that scene with Ethan and the wounded cop, THAT was a great moment. Unexpected, suspenseful, raises the stakes on not just the mission but Ethan as a person, and you truly do not know what happens next. Public places give us moments like that, as opposed to the sandbox mentality of an open airfield and a helicopter dogfight.

Again, all great movies, but it is clear that Act 2 is where the filmmakers hit their stride these last few flicks -- great action, great suspense, and nothing too over the top -- and that Act 2 would've made for a grand finale.

Personally, like what happened after Spectre (4 year wait for Bond 25 coming next year), I'd rather not see a new Mission until 2022 if that means McQ\Cruise\new writer\director take the time to hammer out a cool script and go into filming with a complete screenplay as opposed to on-the-fly writing.",928hh5

e35ih0h,"This was easily the best theater experience I've had all year.  The spectacle and pacing of this film is relentless and just never lets up.  The action and sound design was some of the best in the series.  I loved the fake-outs too.  Even though they all seemed very obvious after a second or two (of course they're not going to kill Hunt 20 minutes into the film or kill the entire team in a nuclear blast or have hunt execute a policeman in the streets) they all had me fooled just long enough to make my heart jump and my mind go, 'no!'.      
  
Does anyone know, was this shot on film?  It looked like it to me, especially in the more dimly lit scenes but I was wondering if anyone could confirm.    
  
If I had *any* negatives, they would be very minor but I thought the color grade was a bit off at times and the cinematography didn't seem *quite* as impressive as McQuarrie's first entry in the franchise or Bird's.  I didn't mind it, it just felt a lot more practical than flashy.    There were still some gorgeous shots though.  The escape boat in the tunnel, a couple of the shots in the club and in the small room where he meets the White Widow, the interior shot of armored truck with Lane sinking (from the trailer) and almost all of the aerial shots all spring to mind.

I mean, IT IS a great action movie, but I didn't feel the ""mission impossible"" vibe for the entire film. Yes, it has a couple of mask and disguise moments, but just a couple, and pretty predictables. 

I don't know exactly why, but as repetitive as it is in the series, maybe I missed the usual ""big heists a `la ocean's eleven impossible robbery or kidnap"", big epic less predictable plot twists, the ""we are alone in this because the IMF abandoned us/dissapeared/betrayed/whatever...

During Walker's meeting with Sloan in Paris, when he hands over the fake phone in an obvious ploy to frame Ethan as Lark, Nostradamus back there exclaims, ""Oh, you know what? I bet *he's* actually working with the bad guys.""

Still, he had nothing on the lady in the back who, during the IMAX preview of First Man, when the sound dropped out entirely and we first saw the panoramic shot of the moon's surface, loudly asked, ""Wow... how do you think they filmed up there?""

One thing I appreciate about this film is its tone. It takes itself seriously, but at the same time isn’t afraid to honor genre traditions like the impossible gadgets that give Ethan Hunt his mission info, or throw in humor to ease up on the stress (which there is a ton!).

Having watched all five prior films over the past week, I am stunned that they took the time to really match up events and answer unanswered questions from prior films. We've been waiting for three films for a full explanation of what happened with Julia! By the way .... Ethan has a type.

Cavill was fantastic. The resolution of the Lane storyline was great. I can't believe they fucking got me again with that double-fake in the middle.

Can I say again how jaw droppingly amazing those final sequences were?

I feel like it was with THIS movie, shockingly the sixth in the series, that we finally get a full picture of Ethan Hunt, our protagonist. He's been a cypher for so long, with only a few layers peeled off in each film, it almost feels weird to actually have him snap into place as a fully fleshed out character roughly 2/3rds of the way through this film.

I love sci-fi and comic book action. Gimme big CGI space portals on a regular basis. But you know what? It was so goddamned refreshing to feel like REAL people were doing REAL STUNTS and it added an absolute ton to the immersion and ""seat of your pants"" feeling (maybe a little too much in IMAX ... I felt like I was being put through the wringer). And Cruise? My god.

My god, the only other time I feel this exhausted is during my annual rewatch of Band of Brothers—and that shit is 10+ hours. 

Vanessa Kirby is a revelation. Girl is very alluring on screen. 

Henry, oh Henry.. Can’t say I care much about his huge studio films (except for UNCLE, which I love) but he does the baddie very well. 

While I am sad to see Michelle go, I think the closure of their relationship was done well—it hurt cos I think she will always be Ethan’s greatest love but now they can push the Ethan-Ilsa thing and I’m all in on that. 

Oh speaking of UNCLE, I remember it should have been a Tom and Henry starrer but Tom dropped out. That should have been interesting since these two have incredible chemistry.

The hand to hand combat is amazing and intense. The whole Paris section of the film was incredible, it just kept delivering on set-piece after set-piece. No one is doing action like this nowadays, it's just great to see this large amount of in-camera filmmaking

It's also the most emotional stakes we've had in the film since MI3 for Ethan, I think a large part of that is bringing Julia back but also the dream sequences really show you the weight that's on Ethan's shoulders. The one he has in Paris where he shoots the guy is beautiful

And between the average comedy lines, the convoluted story, we must also suspend our belief that Ethan can escape unscathed from all kind of crazy and implausible situations and stunts. Really? Do they really expect the viewers to buy that? It would have worked if you were maybe a 6 years old kid, but this whole thing is just sleazy story telling backed up by AAA production value in my opinion.

For some reason, the bathroom scene in MI:Fallout reminded me of True Lies. And I kept comparing both of them throughout the whole viewing. True Lies' plot was easy to understand, it was funny, the action scenes were top notch. That movie didn't try to take itself seriously and it was witty. I think MI:Fallout’s writers tried to emulate the True Lies formula, but it seems they just threw a bunch of shit ideas on a wall and see what sticked.

I'm also really glad how much longevity this franchise proves to have. I get worried how franchises almost always have to keep upping the stakes to the point of exhaustion. Although this movie felt just as dangerous as the other movies, the stakes were fresh and different and it was nice.

My favorite part, however, is listening to how invested the audience was! They'd be gasping and exclaiming, and as a filmmaker myself, that's truly my favorite part of the whole process -- hitting all the right notes and emotionally toying with the audience.

e3byvld,"Just got done watching, amazing movie.  Watched all the MI movies in the past and gotta say this is my favorite by far.

So there were a one thing that I didn't realize until after the movie and discussing it with my gf.  Obviously, Walker (Cavil) turning out to be a villain in the movie is the turning point(the underground scene when he thought he was talking to Solomon Lane and talking about the agreement they had to frame Ethan Hunt).

However, she stated that she knew he was a villain way before.  If you recall the bathroom scene, Ethan Hunt takes the cellphone out of the Lark Decoy's jacket which clearly indicates its broken.  However, when Walker hands the cellphone over to Erica Sloane, he indicates that he got the cellphone from the decoy Lark but the cellphone clearly isn't broken.

So my questions is, was it intentional that he handed over an unbroken cellphone for foreshadowing purposes or was it a mistake (as I have seen in some other movies in the past with switched props) because I truly believe that underground scene as mentioned previously was supposed to be the ""big scene"" where everything is revealed.",928hh5

e35uwyd,"I’ll offer up a different opinion. 

I found the movie to be good but ultimately disappointing. It doesn’t really do anything new or interesting for the franchise aside from being bigger. And I think that’s unfortunately the way these films seem to be heading. A mindset of “bigger is better.” 

The plot is kind of dumb and I find it perplexing that some people are saying the writing is good. 

Some of the acting felt a bit off. Mostly from proven actors like Angela Bassett. 

The CGI, though used sparingly, stuck out even more as fake because so much of the action is practical. 

I wish the movie took a bit more risks. It felt like it was struggling with whether it wanted to be a realistic action film or over the top and as a result it kind of ends up in the middle. It’s also a shame that the film doesn’t really challenge the audience emotionally. I know it’s “just an action movie” but there are moments with interesting ideas that present a moral or emotional conflict but it doesn’t really commit to them. 

The stakes don’t feel real and I was never worried someone important was at serious risk. 

I hate that the bulk of my comment is negative but I figured it’d add more to the discussion than just saying what everyone else is. 

Overall I *did* like the movie. The stunts were impressive, I enjoyed the score for the most part, and I love me some lens flares so I liked the look of it. I’ll definitely see it again sometime. ",928hh5

e3jppym,"I'll start with saying that I liked it and enjoyed myself but, it was weaker than the previous movies. I'm just gonna go over the bad stuff, the good things about this movie are obvious. 

I have 2 big problems with it. 

1) There was no heist. This was the best part about the previous film. There's this big heist they have to pull off that is ""impossible"". I feel like it lacked this centre piece that the movie revolvs around. You could maybe say the breaking out of the antagonist Lane but that doesn't really count. 

2) The movie was waaayyy too predictable. Henry Cavill turning was sooooooo obvious that I was hoping throughout the movie that it would be something else, that I missed something, that they please would do something else, but of course they didn't. From him turning on the movie was very weak imo. That's the entire third act. There was no tension anymore. Two atom bombs going off? Yeah unlikely. 

Their are a few minor things like why was walker so incompetent? Especially with that skydiving scene? I mean if he wasn't saved A lot of shit wouldn't have happened. Also this Lane doesn't really match with the Lane from the previous movie? Why does he head of the IMF die, we don't really care for him do we? 

I think this would have been a great opportunity to sort of pass on the torch. Tom Cruise won't always be able to break his ankle. I would have loved it if Walker really evolved in this film and became part of the team. 

But like I said, overall still very enjoyable. ",928hh5
e371d7u,"4.5 stars out of 5 stars

Fallout is an intense action epic brimming with thrills!

Christopher McQuarrie directs an action film that is massive in scope, ambitious in realism, and stunning in execution. Fallout goes to multiple exotic locales, shot beautifully, and with memorable cinematography. The stunt work is immaculate with real stunts executed by Tom Cruise. The HALO jump is breathtaking, the bathroom fight is cool, and the gun-play is visceral. The fight choreography is brutal and feels like the punches have weight.

Tom Cruise is the main draw as always. His dedication to performing the stunts for real is admirable, but his dramatic acting as Ethan Hunt is still my favorite part. Cruise is the ultimate action star, but also an accomplished dramatic actor. He runs all over the world, jumps from roof to roof, actually flies a helicopter, jumps from a plane, fights men in hand to hand combat, and shoots firearms constantly in the most exhilarating Mission: Impossible film yet. I may prefer Ghost Protocol more still, but Fallout is a close second for the best Mission: Impossible movie for sure.

The supporting cast is particularly notable this time around with excellent performances all around. Cruise's Ethan Hunt is offset well by the always hilarious Simon Pegg as Benji, who finally gets more to do in the franchise. Newcomer, Henry Cavill is intimidating and formidable as August Walker. Cavill holds his own both in combat and drama alike. 

Surprisingly, Ving Rhames is not only back, but he also gets to deliver more weighted dramatic dialogue. I really liked his performance here. He carries himself with an earnest concern for Ethan as well as a likable presence as Luther Stickell. Likewise, Alec Baldwin has a brief, but incredibly memorable role reprising his part as Alan Hunley. You'll like him in Fallout. 

Similarly, Rebecca Ferguson kills it again as Ilsa Faust. She is cool, smart, and interesting as Ethan Hunt's foil and love interest. I wish there were even more of Ferguson! She could easily play the lead in the next movie. Next, Michelle Monaghan makes a neat cameo with some serious lines and a touching delivery. I was disappointed that her character goes in the direction they went with, but I understand. Lastly for the ladies, Angela Bassett gets a small, but integral role as the head of the CIA Erica Sloane. I hope she appears in more Mission: Impossible movies!

In regards to the villains, Sean Harris is frightening and monstrous as Solomon Lane. Harris is even scarier than he was in Rogue Nation. Also, Vanessa Kirby is sultry and intriguing as White Widow. I wonder if they'll bring her back as she has potential for more on screen crime. She is pleasantly good in Fallout. Overall, the entire ensemble is excellently well cast and aptly utilized. 

All in all, you will be entertained by Fallout. I think there is plenty here for any audience. Fast paced action, character progression, enjoyable dialogue, intriguing story, clever fake outs, and funny jokes. Fallout is phenomenal!",928hh5

The franchise is completely derivative at this point; they literally just make the exact same movie over and over while trying to up the ante each time. I'd say it's pretty similar to the Fast and Furious movies in that respect. It's incredibly fun but also incredibly hollow as you know exactly what's going to happen with every step of the movie despite it trying to act like it has a lot of twists and turns which means there's no real feeling of tension or suspense no matter how close they cut it in each scene.",928hh5

I felt the film could have cut down some of the conflicting factions and random betrayals, which were needlessly complicating the plot.

I really wish they chose something other than a ticking nuclear bomb as the final threat, felt like a really cliche way to end an action movie that had been somewhat unique up to that point. Character moments and dialogue were unnatural, the delivery felt very video gamey in how expositional and cookie cutter it was.

Sound was also top notch and smartly used.

I can't tell if Cavill simply has 2 modes (stare blankly/handsomely or grimace angrily) and has stumpy acting range or if its just the roles he's getting.

This was here and there but slightly subtle throughout half of the movie, but the reveal of Hunt's former lover, and the reason for them breaking up being ""I just can't stop thinking of how many times you could be saving the world at the very moment you look at me"" really just felt like they were making Hunt to be a pinnacle of justice that always succeeds.

e365us8,"So I realize that this is an espionage movie, but Fallout is pretty much a bunch of trolling over 2 and a half hours... not that that's a bad thing.

* Mustache-gate: this one's self-explanatory. What makes it worse is that a month or so ago, Henry Cavill said that he needed to keep the mustache for reasons we'd see in the movie. As it turns out... there's no reason at all. When Cavill is disfigured, his mustache is still intact.

* God damn the quadruple cross scene is ridiculous. Walker is working with Lane... but it turns out it was a honeypot by IMF! The CIA is listening in... but they're actually taking everyone into custody! And then the CIA is double crossed by the guys Walker had. 

* The ending. White screen, didn't throw me off. Showing the sunset but making it look like a nuclear bomb went off, uh yeah I got fooled.

* There was a ton of footage in the trailer that wasn't in the movie. The biggest was the scene with Hunt in the helicopter trying not to crash it into a truck.

* Keeping the scene where Tom Cruise broke his leg jumping to the other building, and then his cripple walk after,... that counts as trolling right?

Overall, very good movie. The stuntwork and cinematography are top notch. I do wish that the movie would be a little more bolder and not make Ethan such a perfect protagonist (not that they need to make him full on evil, but when he fucks up, like say with Hunley, that should be a point of emphasis).

I really enjoyed the first half of the film, especially the car chase sequence through Paris, one of the best car chases I have ever seen. However after they are at the safehouse with Solomon that is when the film went down hill for me. I thought the ""twist"" of Walker being the villain was too obvious and not well done. Also, this had the same issue I had with the last two mission impossibles but more so in this one, the ending action sequence when the two helicopters crash into each other are too ridiculous that it removes all the tension for me. There is so much disbelief I can take before it takes me out of the moment and the film. It started to become like fast and furious level of action in my opinion.

e3ksdrq,"I hated that fake out with the bombs at the end, it felt so cheap.

At first I was silently applauding the creators of the movies for the massive balls it must have taken to kill off everyone but Hunt and leave the  movie ending on a morbid note, then it just doubled back. The reason it felt so cheap, in my opinion, was the blatant detonation imagery they filled the scene with: the blinding white flash and the massive billowing orange clouds. Then the movie just said ""no, none of that was related, they're all okay lmao"". That wasn't a twist, that was a blatant abuse of the audience's trust. The fake news broadcast was a twist. The Benji/Lane swap was a twist. Hunt's wife appearing at the med camp was a twist. This movie was filled to the brim with many amazing twists that didn't feel over bearing. The fake detonation, however, was not a twist. That was just a filthy, lazy move.

If they wanted an ""oh my god did they fail?!"" reaction from the audience they should have just cut away the moment the wire was cut and shown Ethan still hanging off the cliff but not reveal he had removed the key yet. A much more classic (but more predictable, I'll admit) and cleaner way to twist the audience's arm.

How they handled that scene was just stupid.",928hh5
e3oxwt6,"Had high hopes but left disappointed. Especially because it had such an original (For the series) and powerful first 20~30 min.

The film ultimately felt confused on what it wanted to do and tried to do too many things at once.

Cavill's character ultimately felt wasted and predictable... though that could have gone a completely different direction and seemed like it was going to during the first couple of acts.

The action scenes were fantastic though the car chase scenes were a bit much.

That flash forward Ethan had as he envisioned the cop shootout was... ultimately unnecessary and one of many moments the film does a cheap fake switcharoos that felt very tacky and insulting to the audience because the film was trying to set itself up with a more serious tone.

The length of the film also felt a bit much ultimately. And that ending? What was with that ending? The final few dialogues were so bad and corny that it almost felt like a parody of an action film.

It's frustrating because the film had all the pieces to make it great and it could have been so much better. But ultimately it had an identity crisis and could have used a bit more time in editing.

e391fju,"Based on the ratings, I thought this movie would be a lot better than it was. Not saying it’s a bad movie, it definitely isn’t. The action scenes were all super well shot, especially enjoyed the helicopter scene. Just for me it felt like the story dragged on for way to long, I felt there was a good amount that you could cut out. There was also a couple times were I thought “damn, that was convenient”

Like I said, it’s a good movie and I did enjoy it. It just dragged on a little to long for my taste. I don’t really think it deserves a 97% rating on RT, I’d probably say high 70’s - mid 80s is more where it should be

Edit: probably shouldn’t use the RT score since the way it works is stupid. Probably shoulda compared it to meta critic ",928hh5
e3k7dby,"I'm surprised that this movie got critical acclaim. It's not a bad movie, but it plays it very safe which makes it predictable. I was really hyped and excited in the beginning when it seemed like Ethan had failed and that the three nuclear weapons had actually gone off. I thought it was a brave new idea, having a Mission Impossible start off with Ethan failing and going after the villians as a form of revenge or to bring them to justice. But nope, it was all staged. 

And I KNEW it was just a fakeout the moment Ethan makes the phone call and CNN immediately reads the transcript. I was disappointed that MI wasn't going in a new direction which would had been VERY cool to see.

Not a bad movie, but it's nothing extraordinary or worth critical acclaim.",928hh5

e345imb,"Mission: Impossible - Fallout is one of the best movies of the year! I had high expectations going in and was blown away by this movie!

* Tom Cruise fucking killed it in this movie. This seemed like an end of a chapter for Ethan Hunt, with closure from Julia.

* All the stunts were awesome. My favorite was the Paris chase. It was a crazier version of the chase sequence in Rogue Nation.

* The pacing of this movie was fantastic. It starts off slow but once the HALO jump happens, it's a thrilling ride until the credits roll.

* Vanessa Kirby is an excellent addition to the franchise. Tom Cruise seemed to genuinely like her in the movie. Can't wait to see her in the new Fast & Furious spin-off.

* Rebecca Ferguson's inclusion in the story was logical. Hopefully, she joins the IMF in the next movie.

* Henry Cavill was a great villain. He was calm, collected and could hold his own against Hunt.

* The musical score in this movie really elevated the movie. The cinematography and direction were outstanding.

* The only complaint I have was that Wes Bentley was wasted in the movie. As soon as I saw his name on the credits, I was hoping him to be a villain to be set-up for future MI movies.

Overall, this is the best movie in the Mission Impossible series. In a lot of ways, Fallout seemingly felt the 'Dark Knight' of this series (this movie had Two-Face also!) and most of what happened in the movie will probably never be attempted by another movie. Can't wait for Mission 7!",928hh5

Mission impossible 1 had the CIA vault in Langley.

Mission impossible 2 & 3 I dont talk about.

Mission impossible 4 had the kremlin scene, the dubai skyscraper scene, and the mumbai server array scene. (Prolly my favorite MI).

Mission impossible 5 had the server room that was water cooled.

This one didnt really have any crazy break in, I would hardly call the Lane break out a crazy impossible mission. I think what made all the MIs great was they actually had an impossible part of their mission. Instead they tried to play off the nukes being disarmed as impossible. 

But something that I really did like was all the double agent stuff. Ilsa is probably my favorite new character in these movies really hope she stays in them for good but if they make her a love interest it would just ruin it.

Not saying this movie didnt have a super crazy stunt that was more suspenseful than action because there certainly was a lot, I just rather enjoy the use of gadgets and the fort knox type break ins that they usually do.",928hh5

e366g1t,"Hear me out here.

I'm not sure why this movie has as high of a rating as it does. A lot of people seem to like it, and that's fine. Cruise's performance of his stunts are top notch and it shows.

But... on the dialogue end, I was totally thrown for a winch. It seems to me that a LOT of it, especially in the first half, was ham-fisted and was there for the sake of heavy exposition. It felt... very hand-hold-y, and even though I'm only vaguely familiar with the prior movies, there really didn't need to be as much packed exposition as there was. Maybe after coming from movies like IW where the dialogue was ""lean and clean"" with an emphasis on inference between the lines, I simply had a different mindset. The film got a lot better in the second half with better dialogue and streamlined action, though.

If this is the way the Mission Impossible series is set up to be- on the cheesy end, then that's fine. Perhaps I'm just a latecomer and not used to the way those type of movies are done. This is how I feel after seeing it, that's all. Nothing wrong with people who enjoy the movie- it's pretty cool! 

Still standing by the dialogue thing, though. There are a lot of better ways to do it. For instance, the Luther/Ilsa discussion about Ethan's ex-wife is probably one of the highlights. It keeps a nice blend of not being too heavy, a few nice callbacks, a little inference, etc.

EDIT: Come on. If you want to have a healthy discussion, then address the points instead of downvoting them to all hell because they don't agree with every other comment on here. It'd be nice to generate feedback on a movie with differing perspectives. ",928hh5

TECHNICAL GLITCH - anyone else notice that during Michelle Monaghan's final scene with Cruise her face was slightly out of focus?

e35a4ng,"It's very good, but I don't think it's the significant step up from all the others in the series that many people seem to be praising it as - let alone ""the best action film since Fury Road!"" or ""the best blockbuster since The Dark Knight!"" claims that I've seen in a couple of places. (Speaking of which: I liked [this review by Darren Mooney](https://them0vieblog.com/2018/07/19/non-review-review-mission-impossible-fallout/) talking about how Fallout incorporates continuity and callbacks to a greater extent than the series ever before - and how it functions in relation to The Dark Knight, ten years on.)

But I consider all of the series (except M:I-2) four-star action films, for different reasons, so consistency with that is still welcome!

It continues the series' trend of the mid-film action/stealth set-pieces being the highlights, better than those in the films' final act climaxes. In this case the mid-film sequence is [the superb convoy ambush, leading into the van and motorbike chase. I really like the bike chase in Rogue Nation, but this was a step up from that - rivalling the Nick Fury attack in Winter Soldier.](#spoiler)

But as for the final act action climax: [for all the amazing real stunt work in the helicopter chase, once the crash happens I'm afraid it starts to verge on King Kong/Hobbit/Pirates of the Caribbean levels of absurd fall survivability! Somehow, Ethan Hunt's survival in these films is at its least believable when he's at the whims of getting lucky in how a vehicle just *happens* to crash!](#spoiler)

Also, for a M:I film, I was disappointed by the absence of a certain type of sequence: there was no [""here's a high-security place we've got to get into, here's what the security is like, here's what will happen if it goes wrong"" heist caper. I suppose there's an element of that in Hunt imagining the convoy ambush (in which the Thing That Can Go Wrong is not being discovered by security, but crossing a moral boundry). Instead of meticulous planning in advance, the film goes for a lot of double-crossing and on-the-fly improvisation.](#spoiler)

Also on the subject of ""crossing a moral boundry"" - remember that line back in M:I-2, when the villain Sean Ambrose said of Ethan Hunt: ""He'll undoubtedly engage in some aerobatic insanity before he'll risk harming a hair on a security guard's head."" That line turns out to be *the* key thing running throughout Fallout. Earlier this year, Avengers: Infinity War [constantly made its characters hand over what the villains wanted in exchange for their friends' lives, and Fallout does something extremely similar. The difference being that in this film - being a complete entry rather than a part 1 cliffhanger - that attitude is ultimately proved correct.](#spoiler)

There's a line in the film comparing the CIA's hammers to the IMF's scalpels. That must be an intentional reference to M's famous line about James Bond being a ""blunt instrument"", right?",928hh5

e33w6bt,"At the risk of sounding like a huge buzzkill, I didn't love it. It was competently put together for the most part, but stuff like shaky cam and jump cuts during every single fight scene except for the bathroom one really started to bug me. And any time the movie could have taken a risk and done something interesting it just kinda *didn't.* The hospital scene in the start for example, for about five seconds I thought that wasn't a ruse, then I figured it was and when they showed that yeah, it was, it just kinda started me off on the wrong foot with the whole thing. All of the twists and reversals just seemed predictable.

I've seen every movie McQuarrie's done. That guy has a flair for dialogue. Seriously, Way of the Gun and Usual Suspects have some of the best snappy tough guy dialogue in cinema. Ditto Jack Reacher. This had none of that, no cool one liners, the banter was kind of forced and the villain just... really isn't impressive. Seriously, the MI series needs a bad guy as good as Herzog was in Jack Reacher. People point at the Mission Impossible series and go ""*this* is how Bond should be doing it!"" but Bond movies are partially defined by how effective/memorable the villain is and with the exception of Philip Seymour Hoffman in MI3, there hasn't been a single bad guy who made the threat seem legitimate, or stood out in any memorable way. And why the fuck does Alec Baldwin have *another* monologue about how great Ethan Hunt is? The character is turning into Poochie, where if he's not onscreen every other character has to be talking about him. I love Tom Cruise, he's great, he's one of my favourite actors, but between this stuff and how the Mummy went down I'm worried his ego is getting in the way of him making movies.

Anyway that's my piece. Sorry if it sounds overly critical and seeing all the praise the movie is getting is making me feel like I'm taking crazy pills a little bit.",928hh5

e365kz9,"Saw it in IMAX, its good, but I can't help thinking it felt a little hollow. 

My random thoughts: 

I liked the twists and the callback's (White widow is the daughter of Max from the first movie). 

The Halo jump was gorgeous in IMAX, seeing the city below was a visual treat. The cinematography in general was fantastic. Kashmir looked amazing. 

Henry Cavill was very good. I think this and Man from U.N.C.L.E. have been his best performances. Its kind of a shame his Superman is so dull. 

Kimberly Williams-Paisley must be kicking herself for not getting a part - Ethan's ex wife and Elisa all look alike. I'm glad Ethan's ex wife story line was wrapped up. It seemed like a curious loose end dating back to the third movie. 

I didn't like the White Widow character, she seemed like a spoiled brat who got off on violence and messing with other people. Her role seemed kind of pointless. 

I did like that Alec Baldwin's character will be gone. 

I still don't get Benji's role. Luther is the tech guy, and Benji just seems redundant. Also glad Jeremy Renner wasn't around. 

I know I'm in the minority but I still love the second mission impossible the most. It was hilariously cheesy, had the best female lead, fun/cheesy villain, and the best music. And I still like that plot better than the generic macguffins of the other movies. 

I'd rank this movie as being smack in the middle : 

II > III > VI > IV > V > I

I enjoyed the HALO jump and bathroom fight like pretty much everyone else in this thread, but I found the plot extremely convoluted until Walker revealed himself to be Lark - then the plot dropped a lot of the extraneous details and it became a good old fashioned chase to the nuclear bombs. I loved that last act and them cutting between the helicopters and Lane/Ilsa/Benji in the cabin.

Vanessa Kirby is striking to look at but I had no idea what her character was doing or really wanted besides some vague form of diplomatic immunity. Rebecca Ferguson remains stunningly beautiful and badass and I felt like the movie significantly improved whenever she was around. I'm not really sure how I feel about the ending because one of my favourite things about Ilsa was the undercurrent of sexual tension she had with Ethan that never crossed that line into romance, and I feel like with Julia willingly handing over the reins (so to speak) they did cross that line here.",928hh5

It was obvious Cavill was going to be the Lark when they first mentioned him but the reveal was still thrilling and unexpected none-the-less. I feel like these movies are the grown-up version of walking around a corner and having a friend jump out at you. You expect face-swapping and double-crossing but it happens in such an unpredicted way that's just so delightful. The action was more enjoyable in this movie than any of the other Mission Impossibles that I can remember. Like the fight scene in the bathroom, having seen the trailer so many times I felt I knew what was going to happen but it was still great.

As a huge fan of the series and Tom Cruise I do have to nitpick though, there were a couple of times, mostly with the bike chase in Paris where I thought the desire to show off the stunts as ""real stunts"" was getting in the way of the filmmaking, there wasn't enough tension of speed to the chase and every shot had to clearly show Hunt, as if to say ""Look! It's still Tom Cruise on the bike!"".

>!Loved all the twists and turns, obviously they were pretty heavy handed with Cavills character but it worked. I didn't understand why the White Widow was involved with handing over Solomon Lane at the end after all the talk of not letting him out of their sight though.!<

Saw it in IMAX, a couple of very distracting out of focus shots, very grainy in parts too, I think the cinematography was overall much better in the previous two instalments. Would *love* to see one of these films shot on IMAX cameras or even 70mm.

e34c656,"My feelings:

Seemed like they took all the action set pieces from the first 5 movies and then just updated them in some way for this movie. Still managed to somehow top them all. I wish, though, they could have had one fresh scene, like the burj Khalifa in GP or the water tunnel in RN, where I was left wondering how they did that. In spite of all that, it was still really strong action pieces. 

I had avoided all trailers and i’m Glad I did. I gasped at Julia’s appearance too, and my mouth was just as open as the characters...

I had a sneaking suspicion cavill’s “walker” was the mole from the first time they announced the brouhaha with the mustache, even though I have no idea why they needed him to keep it. Still, he was flexed his villainous chops, even if it felt underwritten at times. Felt the “diabolical” part of him didn’t really come out once it was revealed who he was. I guess the heath ledger in “the dark knight” and Javier Bardem in “skyfall” performances have spoiled me. But, yeah, when the reveal twist happened, I thought, hmm, saw that coming a mile away and figured that’s where the movie was ending. And then, I realized we still had another 1.5 hrs left?!?! Holy crap!!!

Rebecca Ferguson continues to light up the screen and i’m Glad they featured her just as much as last time. I had begun to wonder how they would bring back his wife, as they kind of “forgot about her.” Now we know. Only woman meant for hunt is a spy herself. And like others have mentioned, i’m Glad Luther got to show off his chops again instead of just benji. 

Really looking forward to the next one and to see how they can top this. The only thing left is space right?!?? Ethan diving onto a rogue satellite to stop it from firing on the us?!?! 
“MI:7-Satellite”??? 😜

Loved the music during the HALO drop, in fact the music throughout the whole film was amazing, Lorne Balfe killing it. I also liked that there was no music during some of the action set pieces, really gave a me grounded viewing experience.

Not sure if this was intentional but I noticed some callbacks or references, or whatever the appropriate term is, that were in my opinion, prominent in previous M:I films. Bike chase and mountain climbing from M:I2, running sequence from M:I3, car chase sequence from M:I4 and '5. I thought that was pretty cool.

Also liked they showed in the bathroom fight that Walker and Ethan can hit with superhero strength and that they were also in pain from the punches received.

I know the HALO jump was real, but I'm confused as to Cavill's involvement. Was their grappling mid-air actually Cavill? I don't remember exactly, but was the whole fall one shot, or did they cut?

Towards the end, someone (Sloane?) explains that the White Widow was actually a CIA operative and that her whole operation was run by them to...entrap criminals?

But Hunt botched that plan because he didn't know and he didn't want to give away Lane anyway. Right? So that makes White Widow on the good side and we'll see her team-up for the next movie?

However, we saw that Superman is Lank from the start, it’s very obvious, even though I don’t fully understand his drive , at first he was introduced as the perfect spy who would follow commands to the letter then all of a sudden he’s the sophisticated villain. His character needed better work in my opinion.

My second thought is that the movie as always didn’t raise the bar, it’s just another sequel, no one dies and they pull off the mission in the last second. 

The action is great though, but the lack of stakes and the confusing character of the CIA spy (the guy who played Superman) took much of the gravity of the action scenes. Good people should’ve died. I think the movie makers fucked up in this one. ",928hh5

I would've liked to have seen August survive so maybe he can come back in the future, because I thought he was pretty great. Sean Harris is just consistently awesome.

Along the same lines, having Ethan not knowing how to fly a helicopter (and miss with the cargo net) was a neat detail that really elevated the stakes of an already off the rails chase. I loved how his solution to getting the detonator in the end was literally ramming his helicopter into Walker’s. 

My only gripe is that Tom Cruise is once again the weakest link in terms of acting in a movie where he is the star. The only exception being the scene with the Paris cop. Not that I watch MI movies for the acting, but it’s disappointing considering Tom Cruise has proven in other roles that he is a decent (and sometimes great) actor. ",928hh5
e41g3c5,"Saw this today.

Very fun action movie in the first hour. The nightclub and bathroom sequences were clearly the highlight. Car chase and breakout was also very good. 

Overlong and mediocre thereafter. Quintuple-cross plots have never been of interest to me. The action similarly was not nearly as good and was just ridiculous in the back half. By the time the helicopter stuff and the longest 7 minutes in history happened at the end people in the theatre were laughing at (not with) the movie.

Of course, Cruise doesn't age.

i'm gonna say the 4th one was likely a lot better, but i can't say for sure. i remember loving that one, thinking it was done really coolly, but it's been a while. it's at least just as good as the 5th one, which is by no means bad, but there's still some boredom sprinkled in it.",928hh5

Stunts like those in this movie are super hard to pull off and coordinate and I want more of them in movies. However, the story just didn't match.

The Halo jump even felt a little forced. They had to Halo jump because somehow it wasn't safe to travel to Paris. That seemed odd. Like they had this idea for a stunt but didn't have a great reason to put it in the movie, so they made up this odd reason about it being too dangerous to travel. 

And then the whole plot itself kinda confused me with the apostles, Max, Lane, and motives. 

It kinda made more sense towards the end when things became just stopping the nukes and figuring out Ethan was being framed, but the story seemed all over the place.

Cruise was Cruise, he wasn't bad but he also wasn't great he was right in the middle. 

Cavill started pretty decent but they basically came out of the box and said he was the bad guy, I guess it was intentional (at least I hope it was with how early they started in that direction), and pretty much from that point on I lost interest in his character.

I suppose the M.I. movies have never truly been my thing, other than the first film, so I guess I'm not really the target for these movies but it was hard to be excited for anything during the movie. Not saying it was bad or anything just not for me.

MI3 had a stronger villain.  There's no reason for the villain in this movie to return since he contributes nothing a new character could have done.
MI4 had better setpieces.
MI5 had a better conspiracy plot.

This is still a very good movie, but the team dynamic built in the last three films just felt so much lesser this time around.  Every time Ving and Pegg show up as part of the plan, the movie is fun, but it's a little too dark and singular for my tastes.

Like ok, they mention in this movie that the government of every country that he ever committed a crime in now wants Lane to do prison time in their country (fair enough), but then that kind of raises the question why the British government would have given Lane up for extradition to other countries if they apparently never wanted him to leave their custody in the first place.

**Edit:**

And what was meant to be the reason why Walker let Ethan live instead of shooting him when he was hanging on to the elevator floor grate?

Ethan says something like, “You can’t kill me until you get the plutonium” and then Walker just kind of nods, but I thought he already had the plutonium secured by that point? That... doesn’t really make sense.",928hh5

Overall I didn't like this much. Re-hash of prior plots. Who couldn't see that Cavill was the bad guy? The reveal was not good. I guess Cruise is just allergic to having an understudy for this part. It went on too long. Too many of the same kind of chases and action sequences.

Michelle Monaghan got the shaft, she's such a good actress. Furguson got shafted too. She barely has anything to do. It would have been more interesting if he tried to have the relationship with Michelle.

You have all this incredibly serious stuff going on, and Tom Cruise just killing it, one of the best car chase scenes in filmmaking history, and then Simon Pegg cracking jokes about holding the tablet incorrectly...

**WHAT?!**

The 3rd act was a little shaky with the cutting back and forth from the bomb to the helicopters, and it was made worse by just how good the scenes with Ethan were, the scene where he runs into his ex-wife and all that stuff. But those little doses of humor were just not needed at all, and I don't really get why they shoved them in.

e34fhf4,"I haven't seen anyone talk about this yet, but isn't the film an amalgamation of Nolan movies plus some video games?

-The Paris scene where they free the bad guy is from The Dark Knight; anarchist transported by police van and motorcade are diverted right and underground by truck and ambushed. A police van gets shoved into the water.

-The shot of the spinning van filling with water is both the Inception van going off the bridge and the Inception corridor scene.

-The scene where the van gets stuck in the wall happened to Leonardo in Inception.

-Tom hanging onto the hanging payload during the helicopter scene was Bane inside a dangling plane in the opening of The Dark Knight Rises.

-The main theme (? The music that played during the credits at any rate) was a copy of the music that plays during the opening of The Dark Knight Rises.

-Henry Cavill goes Two Face at the end.

Videogames:

-The helicopter dangling off the edge of a snowy cliff, plus hanging inside it and climbing up it is from the opening/midpoint of Uncharted 2. Although Nathan Drake is dangling off a train, he's there because he had just been chased by a helicopter with a machine gun.

-The ending village location just prior was very reminiscent of the snowy village towards the end of Uncharted 2, just after this dangling scene. The director said the opening of Rogue Nation was taken from Uncharted 3, so these two observations don't seem so farfetched.

-Isn't the dream where Tom Cruise goes undercover with the bad guys and shoots people 'No Russian' from Modern Warfare 2?

-The ending location also looks like one of the ending locations of Modern Warfare 1 (COD4). The location looks the same, there's also a helicopter shooting, and they're chasing after nukes!

It's making me think that most of the film is taken from multiple sources. Anyone see any other inspirations?

It took six movies, but they finally started putting in real effort into exploring who Ethan Hunt is. You can absolutely say that these movies never really *needed* deep characterization and that's not what they're about, but this movie shows it doesn't have to distract from the epic set pieces.

It also doesn't hurt that Henry Cavill is the best villain since Phillip Seymour Hoffman (even if his turn was obvious from a mile away).

It also brings back the best parts of the best movies. I'd like the next movie (which I feel should be Ethan's final movie) to bring back EVERYONE. Carter, Zhei, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Laurence Fishburne, hell even the annoying Australian from II. Make the threat something from Ethan's past, maybe connected to Phelps, that's about hurting *him,* not causing a global apocalypse. Bigger isn't always better.

If they *really* want to drop jaws with the last movie, they could make Ethan *actually* turn out to be a bad guy (like Walker said, he's been disabowed so many times it'd be understandable), bringing it full circle with Jim Phelps turning villain in the first movie.",928hh5

Some of it felt like a retread of other action movies I'd seen, some of them doing it much better like the Bourne movies for instance. The first car chase felt somewhat generic to me, yet I really liked the moment with the police office under the bridge. That was really well done. Some of the twists were pretty good, and some of them were expected. I knew right away that Caville would end up being one of the main bad guys. The helicopter scene was pretty damn good, and I'm pretty sure that Cruise was actually dangling under a real helicopter because I couldn't notice any CGI fuckery in most of those scenes. Overall I think I'd give it a 7.8/10.

The cast was great and it had a solid plot. There was also a decent amount of twists and turns.

Only real downsides were that the score was only okay I thought and I feel like the trailers showed a bit much.

Overall I would give this a 9.5/10. One of the best action movies in years.

Also, this isn't good or bad, but I always felt the Mission Impossible movies were very standalone films. Like Bond, you didn't have to watch all the films to understand the new ones.

What I liked: The action scenes are uniformly great.  I thought the bathroom fight was amazing and couldn't be topped, then I thought the motorcycle chase topped it and couldn't be topped, and then the helicopter chase topped that. And that's not even mentioning the HALO jump, the rest of the Paris chase, the London footchase, or the final fights. This is getting buzz as the best action movie since Fury Road, and I need to think on that a bit but it's great and I think it's easily the best this year.  The performances I thought were all strong, and I think weirdly the best example of that is Wes Bentley.  He had like 2-3 minutes of screentime and managed to seem like a fully formed character. This probably takes the mantle as my favorite Henry Cavill performance, and Cruise and the lot were all great as expected. I seriously could have watched another 2 hours of this, it was so good.

Normally when I post in these discussions, I have a section where I talk about what I didn't like, but everything I can think of right now is either a dumb nitpick or didn't really change how I felt about the movie.

e347oyo,i'm convinced there's no stuntman involved in motorcycle scene.,928hh5
e347pz9,"I really loved this movie. The stunt work in this film really elevate this movie to one of the better action movies I've seen. Once the movie starts it never stops impressing. It never once dragged which is amazing considering it's almost 2.5 hour runtime. Tom cruise deserves a lot of credit for going all in for this film. It made this film really fun to watch.

There are a couple of minor issues I have with this film and to a certain extent the franchise as a whole. First of all, I kind of wish the reveal of Henry Cavill being the villain wasn't as obvious. Part of the reason it was so obvious was the trailers kind of gave it away, so I wish they hid that better. Also, while I loved the helicopter scene, it was a bit over the top. There comes a point when you can no longer suspend disbelief. It was very entertaining to watch but the colliding with the helicopter and the crash and them being perfectly fine and that hook somehow being able to snag onto the cliff and hold that much weight. It was just too much and briefly took me out of the film. But I still love the sequence because again the stunt work is impressive. 

My final issue is more with the franchise in general. I kind of feel like there needs to be real consequences in these films which is why the opening scene actually caught me off guard and they fooled me into thinking that the film makers actually decided to have the bombs go off. I think it would be refreshing to see Ethan hunt fail for once. Things just happen too conveniently for him.

Overall though I loved this film. It is my favorite of the franchise and I would love to see another one. I would like to see if they can improve on the franchise even more than they already have with this film. I would give a solid 9/10",928hh5

1) this was the first true sequel of the franchise. Everything else has just been a different story, it was nice to directly follow the story of the last film. 

2) there was a callback to each previous film at some point. 

MI:I) Max & climbing on the helicopter
MI:2) motor cycle/rock climbing
MI:3) the mask switch with the villain.
MI:4) the car underwater and assassin shooting someone in the passenger seat. Also killing the director. 

There was also the slight nod to Avengers: Infinity War by having Jeremy Renner in the previous movies but not this one.",928hh5
e34az51,"Loved it. Tom Cruise really goes all out in these movies and it shows with the amount of prep and training involved. I loved the helicopter sequence. Props to Cruise for learning how to fly. The bathroom fight was a blast and Henry Cavill sure can throw a punch. There were some cheesy lines here and there, but that’s expected. 

One complaint was how easily the team let the plutonium get away at the beginning. I get that Luther’s life was on the line, but if them losing the plutonium was necessary to further the movie, I wish they could have handled that differently as opposed to, “wait a second gang, did we forget something” type of deal. Just a minor critique is all. 

If you go into this movie hoping for a great action movie then you will not be disappointed at all. 9/10 in my book. ",928hh5

I loved that he didn't win all the fights and he was limping and constantly out of breath. The last scene the guy was just on his last legs. It was (oddly) cool to see his last scene end with him in the hospital bed.

Two other critiques; helicopter scene and the “hook” all seemed a bit too long, but it was fun. And along with that, I am pretty sure they re-used a clip of the helicopter spinning downward twice.. really looked like the same clip.

e34cpui,"I give it 8/10 only and here's why:

Just saw the movie. The action and emotional stakes in this movie was unmatched and unprecedented. It was a ravaging 2 hour movie that constantly forces you to expect anything (even Ethan being a villain). I liked the values that were explored in Ethan, relating to the 'kill one to save many' philosophy. It gave him more depth that we've ever seen. And Lane's character reminded me of the Joker as his every move/plan is to break Ethan.

 This was a great build up.  Therefore, I think it deserved a grim/dark ending which every plot & dialgoue constantly instigated throughout the movie. It would have been interesting in my opinion to have had Ethan lose by not saving the only person he cared about - Julia. I think this would have been a great way for the writer or director to say ""yes Ethan is a great guy but his goodness comes with consequences which he cannot escape."" The fact that the movie ended with Ethan triumphing over Lane kinda lessens the significance of Julia's character buildup. Lane should have won, maybe not totally but to a degree he should have  been right. His character doesn't come off as the irrational psychotic villain, instead he is portrayed to be a high functioning, rational psychopath. Hence it is only befitting that his doctrines, though pessimistic and perhaps insane, hold some truths. That sometimes the system you sacrifice for turns on you and abandons you. Again and again, Ethan has been a victim of this, yet he's always been the same, always climbing back up and reaching the trigger on time.

I think the movie would have been a 10/10 if only it stayed true to its title: Fallout. In fact an ending where Ethan never got to the trigger on time would have made for a more tasty sequel. I would have loved to see him lose his values in that sequel and have him crawl his way back out of the hole. That'd made a great ending of a franchise even. Just like wolverine. :)",928hh5

e35erjj,"it was fun to see the mustache that toppled a franchise in action.  overall, i didnt like this one as much as the previous ones.  the story and flow seem disjointed, the reasons for moving from one scene to another were odd.  the setpieces werent as cool as something like the server infiltration with fake hallway, but the bathroom fight was very kinetic.  you could feel the impact when someone gets hit or thrown.

ethan being framed as being john lark is laughable,  like they would believe he has the time to be a secret international terrorist and write manifestos.  i have to think that this is intentional lampooning of how often he gets disavowed, and the writers figure they have to step it up.  

i think the biggest shame is how ilsa is now relegated to that side character that tags along.  theres a minor conflict but that goes away conveniently quickly.   this is in line with how the story is more straightforward, but i did like her mystery and intrigue in rogue nation.   

seeing julia again is nice,  this one is the more referential since they talk about people and events with no other context.  i like the running theme that ethan cares for the one out of millions with ving rames, the cops, and in the end,  when the villians place julia in position to hurt ethan, it becomes his biggest strength since he can save everyone.  going full circle what alec baldwin said before",928hh5

e37uluh,"You know what would've made M:I Fallout and all-time classic and revolutionary entry into the consistent (yet formulaic) series? Spoiler thought below, but this is a spoiler discussion anyway. 

If they explosion went off at the end. Or even better yet, if the moment where Walker turns his face, the scrapped/burnt side reveals that it's a IMF mask that he kept complain about in a baiting manner. Turns out to be Sean Harris' Solomon Lane, and yatta yatta tech explanation, the actual detonation piece they need was with Walker back at the base. If the IMF can outthink and outsmart the CIA and find a solution to a bomb that cannot be defused, it is no stretch to assume The Syndicate/Apostles can do the same. They out maneuver Benji and trick Hunt, using IMF's own tropes.

Lane wanted personal revenge versus Hunt anyway, and was willing to die getting it. To have him just chill and wait at a hut was sort of underwhelming, just like the final (should've been epic) fight with Walker was very underwhelming.

Cut back to the adjusted end scene, where Lane reveals himself, and gives a brief villain monologue. Explaining how he duped Ethan with his own devices and tricks, and how Hunt is his own worst enemy. Blah blah blah, you're luck finally ran out, and I told you, you should have killed me. He throws Hunt the detonator, explaining how it won't serve him any use, and neither will his team. Cut to Walker successfully subduing Ilsa and radioing Hunt while Benji is heard struggling to breathe. The radio is choppy, but enough for Hunt to hear  Benji's neck breaking with the noose. Cue the ""Everyone you love will die"". 

So the final shot would be Lane ripping off the Walker mask, and staying the creed: ""With no suffering, there can be no peace. The greater the suffering, the greater the peace"". He says this as he casually walks backwards, off the cliff. As Hunt instinctively attempts to grab Lane, he fails and frantically yells into his comms for Benji or Ilsa to respond. ""Eth...."" the bomb detonates, whiting out the screen. Cut to black, credits roll, somber rendition of M:I theme.

Next film, who survived? Was Ethan out of range? Will he be blamed for everything? Does Jeremy Renner take over the franchise? If Hunt is alive, is Renner the new secretary? Did the IMF somehow think of a way ridiculous manner to survive the bomb? Is it the end? ",928hh5

e349w2s,"So, I could go on and on about the things I really liked in this movie and how awesome of a point prover this is that Tom is the greatest action star of all time. But I'm going to do this differently, I'm going to focus on what I didn't like.

1. The bathroom fight scene was good, but it was not great. In this age of John Wick and The Raid, you can't build up an awesome fight scene like that and have it be so short. Tom looked great, that other guy looked great but Henry looked STIFF as all holy hell, definitely not the ""Hammer"" of the CIA as it was put. I really wanted to love that scene but in the end it was just OK for me. Rogue Nation had fight scenes with him and Rebecca that were much better choreographed IMO. Damn did he look menacing though.
2. I did NOT like how Walker died. They basically teased him vs Ethan the whole time and we never got a proper fight between them. I don't know if that is because of how stiff and awkward Henry fights that totally didn't mesh with Tom's fluidity and experience, but it was completely unsatisfying to me.
3. The end of the movie was pretty utterly predictable the second they were going to a medical camp, right down to them solving the problem at 1 second remaining. Still well shot and tense, but super predictable, especially with his ex wife being there. The husband threw me for a loop though, bravo with that one! 
4. The CGI was pretty bad. The ending helicopter part was especially Black Panther bad, but it really wasn't great throughout. I guess they needed most of their money for the star power, but I still expect a little better for a movie of this caliber.

That's pretty much all my criticism, I really enjoyed it otherwise! Tom's stunts were insane and the general sound editing with the gunshots was perfect. Almost Christopher Nolanesque with his sound design and some of the camera shots (breakout scene especially). I can't wait for the next one! ",928hh5

There was NO POINT in Cavill needing that mustache.  The only justification for him keeping it for the filming of M:I would be if they had already filmed key action scenes later in the story line (because I am sure some of those action set pieces would be too expensive to reshoot.

e39ff37,"A few thoughts:

* Like all the Mission: Impossible movies, except for the first, the characters and plot were completely disposable.
* I was not a huge Ghost Protocol or Rogue Nation fan but the action setpieces in this one were on another level and covered up most of the shitty dialogue and non-existent character development.
* They really went balls to the wall with the action (it's honestly the best stuff I've seen since Inception, probably) and I cannot help but think it's meant as a send-off to Tom Cruise. Honestly, I don't know how they'll top it. Also, for the first time in this series you can really tell he is a 50 something year old man doing these stunts. I can see Paramount doing a soft reboot or something in the future.
* The callback to the first movie, having Vanessa Kirby be Vanessa Redgrave's daughter, was very unnecessary fan service
* As a corollary to the plot being silly, the movie really drags at points. There's no reason it should have been 2.5 hours. Those dream sequences should have been cut. ",928hh5
e3ewmwt,[deleted],928hh5
e3edzp5,"MI6:Fallout was...okay.  It's in the middle of the pack of the series with Ghost Protocol at #1 and MI3 at the bottom.  A few of my gripes:

* Even though I've seen all of the MI movies, some references to the previous movies left me in the dark (I only realized them after reading comments here).  The MI series is not iconic like Star Wars or the Marvel movies, so those references and homages to the original movie are going to go right over many casual moviegoers' heads.  You really need to see Rogue Nation before watching Fallout since this seems to be a sequel to that movie.  You won't know who Ilsa is, and you'll have no backstory to her relationship with Ethan Hunt or Lane.  To be honest, I only have vague memories of Rogue Nation, and I did not even remember Lane in that movie or all the nasty things he did.  Fallout assumes you know who Ilsa, Lane, Alec Baldwin's character, and even Hunt's wife is (and what he did to protect her) already.  

* Lots of chases in cars, on the ground, in the air, etc.  Lots of fight scenes.  Lots of shooting.  Put them together and you have...lots of action scenes.  But where's the movie?  Even though the plot may be simple - recover the plutonium orbs - it's extremely convoluted with Walker, White Widow, British Intel MI6, etc.  They were throwing out names and places left and right, so it was hard keeping up.  Even in a 2+ hour movie, you still have to keep it short and sweet so a general audience can follow.  

* Someone below said this was Cruise's worst acting role, and I kind of agree.  Why?  I just realized Cruise is not a good action star.  Basically, anyone can do Cruise's action scenes and make them look better.  Vin Diesel or The Rock are my protypical action heroes because I can believe they are getting the shit kicked out of them and still getting up.  But what make Cruise special is that he can act, and that's why I intensely follow him and root for him in movies.  Cruise had little acting parts in the movie.  Plenty of action scenes, but that's it.  I wish they would have had more espionage in this movie.  Flush out the bad guy instead of just making it a shoot 'em up action movie.",928hh5

First off, killing Alec Baldwin. I really liked the idea of the Secretary being in on some of the stuff that the team did and was sad that he was gone so quickly.

Second, I don't like the fact that Ethan and Julia aren't married any more. I loved the idea that they were still together and he possibly disappeared to be with her from time to time. None of the other movies as far as I can remember specifically stated that they weren't married any more. Just that she was in hiding.

Third, this is the first time they didn't have an actual impossible mission. All the other movies had something that they needed to do that seemed impossible but they came up with a whole plan and executed it to get what they needed. This one had the deactivation of the bomb but all the pieces weren't as elaborate so the whole last action sequence was a chase scene. That wasn't part of the plan.

This franchise needs to die for 10years so someone can come up with something new. I am tired of movie franchises that have a great angle like MI, that just degenerate into what is just another forgettable, lame action movie which is nothing more than an excuse to link some stunts and fight scenes together.

At the end I think they even take the piss out of it themselves, with all that ""how can you do that?"" ""I'll find a way"" bullshit. Also, hunt clearly is not supposed to be able to fly a helicopter...you dont just jump in and wiggle the control stick.....that was awful.

e37pued,"A lot of people are talking up MI:Fallout as the new Fury Road, and this is my take. MI never got better as a series, at least if we completely ignore that second one, which most do. It is, instead, a testament to persistence. When Mission Impossible came out in 1996, the status quo of American blockbuster action cinema was a cultural landscape, and Mission Impossible stood there, in a hole. Not a deep hole, just as shallow as Tom Cruise was short. 

A lot of people took turns jumping down that hole with Tom, to see what it was like and some of them came out wishing they hadn't lowered themselves to that level, while many enjoyed the unique experience of doing so. As time went on, the landscape started to descend. It was pushed down by megastudio aversion to risk, by computer generated special effects, by digital filmmaking and projection, by software color correction, and by a general lack of rebellious pulse, out of fashion for reasons I won't get into here.

While this happened, the floor of that hole did not descend with the rest of the landscape. Instead, it remained right where it was. It could afford to because Tom Cruise had the power to resist change. Now the floor of that unmoving place has become much higher than the shifting landscape, and is consequently spoken of as the ""pinnacle"" of action cinema, a series that has ""reached new heights"", or for the more critical, a movie placed ""too high on a pedestal"".

When they show wide shots of the helicopters flying, it's usually real and it's great-looking, but then they cut to Tom or Henry in a cockpit in front of a very obvious green screen. There's convincing skydiving choreography completely sullied by a video-game-quality CG Paris below.

e37c21a,"Realized I forgot to include this on release day, whoops. 

Anyways this was pretty interesting stuff. Didn't know IMAX was involved and so I'm glad there will be an experiential element to the film rather than just a standard biopic. The cockpit stuff was neat but that shot of the lunar surface really got me. Reminded me of seeing Gravity on the big screen and occasionally getting some vertigo feelings from that. Definitely will try to see it in IMAX now. ",928hh5

I think the lunar surface stuff looked a bit too obviously fake, especially in contrast with the more gritty, aged, 1960s looking feel of the rest of the film. I really like what we did see, and I'll almost certainly see this film, but I'm not as excited for it as other people will be. I'm far more excited to see the smaller roles (Kyle Chandler, Corey Stoll, Jason Clarke) than I am to see Ryan Gosling.",928hh5

I hope they play it at the imax in the national air and space museum because I'm definitely seeing it there if that's the case.",928hh5

1: Hanley is going to turn Ethan in to save IMF

4: But it's Benji, not Lane. They tricked him to confess!

5: But Erica Sloane betrays everyone, cuts the power and sends in a unit to take everyone in anyway!

6: But Sloane's men are filled with Lark's agents and they attack IMF.

It was a top notch fight sequence, once of the best IMHO.  Fake John Lark was a BAMF! Hard to describe why I liked it so much but I’ll try. I feel many times, in badass Asian guy fights, the focus seems to be the choreography and making the moves look nice or fluid. It also feels like there is often a lack of true emotion or reaction. Sure, there’s usually yelling/screaming and lots of angry faces but it’s all very superficial.  The bathroom fight did not subscribe to any of that. Fake John Lark was enraged and definitely doing his level best to kill them both as quickly and violently as possible. Kudos to Tom Cruise for being a true talent. When his head went through a porcelain urinal, he didn’t spring back up like nothing happened. He genuinely looked like he got his bell rung and might not have been able to tell you what he was doing in a swanky Paris nightclub bathroom at that moment.

e39kjv4,"My biggest problem with the movie (I don't have many) is that Walker never gets to do anything bad ass but the movie still wants me to see him as this major threat to Hunt. They *tell* us how bad he is -- the CIA lady likens him to a ""hammer,"" there are several references to how many terrorists he's killed, his skills as an assassin, etc -- but we are never really shown that he is anywhere near as physically capable as Hunt. 

I think if that bathroom scene had played out with the John Lark stand-in slightly outclassing Hunt (like he did) only to be brutally beaten by Walker, it would have set-up more of a threat. As it stands I don't think the Walker character worked all that well. The guy was even getting beat by Hanley, who's had a desk job for however many years, til he pulled a knife on him! 

Don't get me wrong. Cavill did a good job in terms of performance. In terms of the script / story, however,  he just... Didn't seem very menacing. Or even competent.

Alot of things had to go right in Henry Cavill's plan for it to be carried out, many of which were out of his control. He had to be saved by Tom Cruise during the jump, Iisa had to show up and shoot the asian dude in the bathroom, Tom Cruise has to not get caught by the French police (maybe Henry Cavill sabotaged his bike and he wanted him to get caught?), Solomon Lane has to not get killed in the Paris chase.

e3898q6,"I'm trying to imagine how the movie goes if hunt wasn't able to save him there. Like he is probably able to take out fake lark in the bathroom stealthily instead of getting into a huge fight. Then he does meet white widow with the face mask on, and frees lane as before. 

But walker isn't there to frame hunt, and so the trade goes as intended? Hunt gives WW lane and it gets revealed she is working for the CIA, and then they would have to try and figure out a way to locate the 2 remaining bombs.

Although this alternate storyline could still have Ilsa as an antagonist still trying to kill Lane, and then it becomes a CIA vs. MI6 fight?

You know what, even this alternate plot could have been interesting.",928hh5

I was thinking the whole time Hunt was setting it up ""That shouldn't work, if this works it's a violation of one of the most basic laws of the universe, he should absolutely miss."" Of course, since it was a movie, I assumed they wouldn't care about physics, and expected to be let down. I was very pleasantly surprsed when it just missed.",928hh5

The best moment for me, however, was the Ethan imagining having to kill the French cop, the score, editing and cinematography in that scene were absolute perfection. It's a genuine moment in a movie that falls in a genre demanding relentless set pieces ",928hh5

Once Ethan got his air working again and pulled his chute, he kinda just woke up and seemed completely fine. 

The one thing that bothered me in an otherwise epic movie.",928hh5
e3afdq4,The non IMAX footage on the IMAX screen was blurry. I guess they tried to up scale the footage. The IMAX footage was incredible. ,928hh5
e3mbe83,"Picture-wise IMAX was disappointing for me, sadly, but I don’t blame the movie. The screen is just too big for making 4K look good. The image noise was especially nasty in dark scenes.

Of course, some scenes were actually shot in IMAX (helicopter, parachute) and those looked amazing. Really stood out.

I really wish filmmakers (and cinemas) would move up from 4K soon. It just looks bad, even on normal sized cinema screens. 

Edit: to be clear, the cinematography was great! It’s just the technical limitation of 4K.",928hh5

e3exkhs,"It was 3 jumps stitched, they did 106 jumps overall. Only 3 minutes per day had the right lighting for filming. (see NYT article)",928hh5
e3kfytg,"I think they only stitched 2-3 scenes together. I caught one cut near the end when Tom Cruise flips through a cloud or something before emerging for the final section (where you actually see the city below them) but it was still a lot of long ass takes. 

And for once, it not being one long take is actually almost more impressive because it proves that they did the ENTIRETY of the HALO jump more than 3-4 times to get the right combination of shots.

EDIT: 3-4 times MY ASS - **THEY DID THE JUMP ONE HUNDRED AND SIX TIMES** jesus christ",928hh5

Even the new supporting cast were more rounded and memorable (I know opinions differ wildly about that with UC4, don't hate me).

Thematically, Hunt’s morality was constantly being put to the utilitarian test - the Berlin choice with Luther, busting Lane out as payment for plutonium, getting near busted by the cop after extracting Lane, White Widow upping the price and requiring Ilsa as recompense, etc. It reminded me a bit of how the Joker forced his marks into making choices that undermine their morality either way.

In a way, both films ponder how far a person’s morality can carry them through impossible choices (no pun intended) before breaking.  TDK does so through how its antagonist tests everyone; M:I Fallout does so through how its protagonist is tested by everyone.

But Renner's character basically did the same thing in the last film and it was a fakeout. Also the trailers made it look like Walker was trying to kill Hunt, which I assumed was probably purposeful misdirection.

But instead they played it straight, which for this series is kind of the equivalent of a twist.",928hh5

What struck me the most is how it beared almost no resemblance to Rogue Nation despite it being the same director.

I'd even dare to say that, aesthetically and stylistically, this felt like something directed by Christopher Nolan, Lorne Balfe's score for the movie certainly felt like a Zimmer score for a Nolan movie.

e34mgdq,"I was telling my friends about this the other day:

Both franchises have enjoyed increased critical (and commercial) success in their second halves. The second half of the M:I franchise scores 30% better on average than the first half, while the second half of the F&F franchise scores 35% better than its first half.

Both franchises are generally well liked by audiences for each entry, apart from the second film in each: Mission: Impossible II and 2 Fast 2 Furious both scored negatively with both audiences and critics.

Both franchises are known for their big stunts.

Both franchises have seen big names leave the series and return (Ving Rhames/Vin Diesel - even have similar first names!) and big names join the series for repeat instalments later on (Simon Pegg/Jeremy Renner/Dwayne Johnson)

The current run of Star Trek films has had two directors: JJ Abrams, whose feature debut was the third M:I film before going on to produce the next three, and Justin Lin, who joined the F&F franchise with the third entry, before going on to direct the next three also. (Lin has skipped 7 and 8 but will be back for 9.)

Both franchises have had single-entry directors who have also worked on superhero movies (Brad Bird - Incredibles ; James Wan - Aquaman).

Each franchise only has one returning director respectively (Christopher McQuarrie/Justin Lin). Otherwise, every other entry has a different director.

Also Vin Diesel voiced the titular role in Brad Bird's debut, Iron Giant!",928hh5

e33yyo8,"I agree, it really did feel like a final chapter in a lot of ways, not least because I genuinely have no idea how they could possibly top the stunts they've already done. Like what is even left?? But also the way they called back to each of the earlier films somehow, the way they brought characters back, tied up all the loose ends, and at the same time made it clear that we know precisely what everyone remaining is going to go on doing off-screen even if we never see them again. That's the best kind of finale, in my opinion: when it doesn't end the characters' stories, it just gets them to a point where you can walk away, comfortable in the knowledge that somewhere out there in their fictional world, they're going on with their lives, doing exactly what they're meant to be doing. That felt like what we got here.

That said, I'm pretty sure Tom Cruise is going to keep making these movies until they literally kill him, and this movie is going to make so much fucking money nobody's going to stop him. I know insurance is expensive, but I'm pretty sure Tom Cruise will just pay the difference himself if it comes down to it.",928hh5

Balfe's from the 'School of Zimmer', having worked with him many times as an additional composer. This film was basically The Dark Knight Rises without the Batman themes - though, in fact, the Syndicate theme IS essentially a big Batman Begins motif.

Hans Zimmer's Nolan scores are very much My Sound, so I was very much here for it!

Extra fun fact: Zimmer did M:I2, in which you can hear earlier versions of themes that would later be expanded for The Dark Knight! Full circle!",928hh5

It’s a far more dark soundtrack then the other films which is interesting. But my favourite track is (it might not just be for this character) the piano piece that played when we see Walker, err, walking away through London. Has a very meticulous feel about it. Very nice. 

And there’s was like three different versions of the MI theme! Got the all out version, the heart beat thomping version. And then the synth style one which I believe takes place in London but I might be wrong.

Anyway, for me the music was a unique take that really worked and gave a bit more weight to the film without removing the Hollywood flair that’s found in the past MI films.",928hh5

If Tom can't do stunts anymore, or if the studio\insurers don't want him to, they can make MI7 a total atmosphere/espionage movie and I'd be down.

Looking at the opera scene in Rogue Nation and the bathroom brawl in this one, it becomes clear that for a big suspenseful action scene you don't have to necessarily shut down freeways and go on location across the world. All you need is a creative mind (McQ/writer/directors), a few actors, and a Burbank backlot. lol

As a huge fan of this style, I don't mean to be reductive when I say he's something of a Zimmer-style clone, and this score was effectively TDKR's, which I LOVED.

Walker is also a bit of a maverick (lol) with reduced self-preservation instincts, but in a different vein to Hunt - he tends to solve problems 'as the crow flies', regardless of how many corpses he has to wade through to make it happen. That's why he's the hammer in Sloane's analogy.

I also got the feeling that Walker used that situation to gauge Hunt a bit, check out where his line is (obviously before he got struck by lightning), as well as sabotage the mission somewhat - if Hunt doesn't have the balls to jump after him, he gets to sort out the meeting just how he'd like it. If Hunt jumps after him and gets struck by lightning, Hunt dies or is otherwise out of the game, and once again Walker gets to run things to his liking. Walker just played the odds that *he himself* wouldn't be struck and failed. My theory is that he came to when Hunt gave him his O2, but played possum to delay Hunt's landing as much as possible.",928hh5

They asked to be dropped on the far side of the island, the one with huge cliffs and a glacier. The Navy told them they where crazy, the SAS replied something like ""the enemy won't expect us to come from there"".

* Luther to Hunt’s wife: “something about walking away”
* Various “I’m so sorry’s”
* Hunt to cop, “please awalk away”
* Hunt to cop, “I’m so sorry”

Frankly I think in addition to being trite writing it shows a kind of psychological hang-up of Cruise.

And I think as someone else said they DO fail a lot in the actual film. I think this one and GP is where we see things just go to shit more so than the other films.

Walker only seems to get really angry when he's talking about this idea that the old order is the problem - the other time is with 'Lane'. The rest of the time he doesn't seem to rise much above annoyed/frustrated at what's happening.

Introducing himself doesn't seem to be very important plot wise, so it's probably a character thing. They've just killed a man and are standing next to a pool of blood while the mission is on the verge of going wrong, and he's just coolly saying 'Hi'.

I read that McQuarrie originally had planned to write Brandt out, but Renner wasnt interested.  Since he was occupied with Avengers, they were gonna bring him in for a brief part.  How I understood it was that instead of Luther being captured at the beginning, it was going to be Brandt, and that Brandt was going to die.  And then that would kick off the events of the movie.

Then OMG the rope and hook that some how manages to get stuck in a small rock and not crack.... Blah the ending pisses me off. It would of been better if the bombs went off.

e3529b7,"> Unpopular opinion, I think this should be the last one. The movie was amazing, perhaps one of the best action movies of the decade if I say so myself. I’m truly not sure if they can top this ever.

I'm not sure it needs to be the last one, but I came out of the theater with the same feeling that it's impossible to top this plot, ever. The stakes were just so fucking high and the challenge so incredibly unsurmountable that I jokingly said the next movie will have to be set in either the Moon or Mars because they can't raise the bar any higher in this planet.

The only way I can see the story working is if things take place however many years in the future, with a good chunk of implied plot development between the end of this movie and the start of the next one, so that the story has essentially been reset. This was clearly the end of an arc so they'll need to start fresh.

The challenge with starting fresh is that I definitely agree with you that Cruise has clearly aged. He looks so much like a bonafide dad right now it's kind of ridiculous beyond suspension of disbelief to see him pull off some of these stunts.

If only we had a new actor who could play a ""next generation"" Hunt and Cruise could play the mentor that joins him on what turns out to be his last mission in the field -- without necessarily dying in the end since his name is so closely tied to the franchise.",928hh5

I think the oxygen debacle was just to put Ethan at ease around him so he wouldn't look like a threat. You're very right that the dive ,in hindsight, does seem a little out of his (truly revealed) character however I would argue it was just him purely thinking he was better than the storm. Much like how the movie pointed out that to Ethan all the problems seem minute and manageable....until the moment they are not haha (maybe the same deal with him believing the big gun on the heli was a guarantee of safety until of course the ammo ran out). 

I also believe that in the Mission Impossible world, being the CIA's top ""plumber"" really doesn't make him the best of the best. In the film they stated that obviously John Lark would hire a proxy to fill in for himself at the meeting, which was true. I think a good explanation is that he really didn't know who he was hiring or he once again thought that he was bigger and better than anyone else out there. Even if the proxy was aware of who Lark was, Lark's intentions were clearly to kill him with the help of Ethan.

He stabbed Hunley quickly and tried to shoot Ethan in the helicopter but then became incapacitated when his face got burned so that left him at a disadvantage in the final fight against Ethan.

This was hinted at when Walker was about to shoot the innocent Paris cop because she was simply asking too many questions.",928hh5
e3buoyl,"I personally thought he was losing the fight on purpose. He wanted Ethan dead, but Lane wouldn't let him kill Ethan so Lane could get revenge. Solution? Let the proxy you had to go the meeting kill Ethan for you. If Ilsa hadn't been there, then Ethan dies, and proxy still makes it to the meeting and plan for without IMF involvement goes on. But as a just in case Ethan somehow won, Walker pretends to fight the proxy while secretly jobbing it. He probably intended for him to wake up in the middle of the mask scanning, and was planning on distracting Ethan somehow. Might be giving Walker too much credit, but it makes more sense then some random dude kicking the shit out of the top CIA assassin and top IMF agent.",928hh5

e4wpg0m,"It’s kind of a convoluted plot point, but it is explained at least twice in the movie, if my memory is correct. I’m trying to remember if it actually makes sense though. It’s kind of hard because they kind of just breeze by it.

Anyway, here’s my understanding / what I gathered:

It’s explained when Angela Bassett is ripping Henry Cavill a new one after they accidentally kill the Asian guy in the three-piece suit (an agent of Lark’s) at the nightclub.

Bassett says that her plan was for the real John Lark to be working with the White Widow to extract Lane in order to make the trade for the plutonium. Angela Bassett / the CIA was trying to lure Lark out of hiding with the plutonium deal so that they could bring him in.

She accuses Henry Cavill of screwing up her plan because they accidentally killed “Lark” / Lark’s agent and Ethan took his place in the plot.

It wasn’t meant to happen that way, it was meant to be a CIA-organized trap for the White Widow to alert the CIA when she meets up with the real John Lark.

Hunley later corroborates this when he tells Ethan and the gang in the London IMF safehouse that the White Widow and her entourage are working for the CIA to secure their own immunity from crimes they’ve committed (something like that).

Although I only picked up on this because I saw the movie twice in quick succession, they blow past these plot points pretty quickly in the movie.

**Edit:**

The plot point that makes this kind of hazy is *who* stole the plutonium from Ethan and he gang at the start of the movie. Because Walker is later in possession of it, without apparently having to give anything up for them and without having to expend effort to get them.

It’s kind of implied that it was the CIA, possibly with Walker’s involvement, and then Walker later made off with the plutonium with the Apostle infiltrators in the CIA because they never suspected that he was John Lark.

Something like that.",928hh5

Massive props to Cavill and Cruise for doing most of their own stunts. When you don't have to worry about cutting from the actor to a stunt guy it makes the scene flow so much better. And like you pointed out when Cruise uses his leg for steering on the bike, maybe a pro stuntman wouldn't have done that but it just made it feel like it was more real.

MI is how Cruise wants the world to see him.  Ethan Hunt is not only the biggest daredevil, he's modest and doesn't even want to do these badass things.  

He's empathetic to a fault, valuing each and every life he comes across (unless its the redshirts, he kills them pretty thoughtlessly).

He's charming and everybody likes him, his crew seems to idolize him and still share healthy relationships with him.  The fact that he maintains healthy relationships with women is also incredible, and it's funny how the franchise bends over backwards to show how Ethan lying to his wife and uprooting her entire life and identity was actually positive growth for her.

I mean, he doesn't even have any substance abuse problems like Bond, yet don't think he's one of those creeps that doesn't touch drinks because he really gets off on some weird type of abuse like that one dude in Atlanta, he'll enjoy a beer with his team, just after the mission is unimpossibled.

e36bh97,"Second time seeing it, so originally they're all one unit called The Syndicate. It's run by Solomon Lane and is a world wide crime and terror initiative that was saw in Rogue Nation. When he was captured, the existence of the Syndicate was proven and it was taken down. 

All of the named members were caught or killed. Ethan mentions this about Lark during the double cross, when Lark is still claiming that Ethan is actually Lark - that Walker killed any Syndicate members so there weren't any live witnesses. Which he actually did, if Lark/Walker encountered Syndicate members rather than them being captured, he would kill them.

The Apostles were the remaining members of the Syndicate who were not identified. They were a mystery with the only contact being the alias ""John Lark"". So we still don't know who they are and how many are left. It was alluded that they were worldwide as well, so we only saw one portion of them in this film. 

Lane's nuke plan and the plan of the Apostles was the same plan: destabilize the World in this case by contaminating the water supply of a third of the World's population. And also end Hunt, but if that's not possible, kill his loved ones and himself (Lane) so Ethan has no ability for recourse.

In MI 1, the main link to Ethan and the mole is an arms dealer Max. It seems like The Widow is the daughter of the arms dealer and took up the mantle. She realized that her business is a lot crazier now, and she made a deal with the CIA to get out. Her brother was the more aggressive type so he was okay with the cops (and probably didn’t know the whole plan), and head CIA lady was more Interested in tracking the apostles more than anything else. The widow was just a means to an end. Hope this helps. ",928hh5
e380xeg,"Widow was a broker for arms/weapons dealers. 

She wasn't working for MI6. 

The Apostles were the leftovers of the Syndicate (the group started by Solomon Lane). The Apostles stole the plutonium from Ethan at the start of the movie. They stole it with the intent of selling it to their client John Lark (who we later learn is August Walker). 

The White Widow was to be the broker of the deal between the Apostles and Lark..........but for some reason they sent agents to kill her and Lark, though I'm not sure why.........maybe they figured Ethan would be there posing as Lark and they were really sent to kill Ethan.   

Anyway, Ethan tries to acquire the plutonium pretending to be John Lark. The White Widow tells him the price isn't money but the retrieval of Solomon Lane (the Syndicate's founder).  

When Lane is retrieved, Walker's rouse is unraveled, and he takes Lane (whom he needs to activate the weapons) to Kashmir. 

The question is why didn't the Apostles just give the plutonium to Walker aka Lark in the first place? Why the need for all the subterfuge with the Widow,etc? My guess is Solomon Lane would only help Walker with the bombs if Walker played along to frame Ethan and ruin Ethan. Hence the line ""Why do you have to make things so F***ing complicated?""

Once it was all over, remember Erica Sloane (with the CIA) was on site and took Solomon Lane into custody. Its then revealed that the White Widow is sort of in the employ of the CIA. Erica used the Widow to transfer Lane to MI6, which then cleared Elisa in the eyes of MI6. 

I'll admit that last bit of using the Widow to transfer Lane seemed pointless. The CIA could've just handed over Lane themselves. ",928hh5

I’m never quite sold  on his movies’ aesthetic — all of his released films I’ve seen are given an extensive digital ‘bleach bypass’ that I’m never quite sold on. 

In some sequences, it gives the film a gritty, modern French Connection vibe. Yet in other scenes, it does seem out-of-whack. The intentional messiness can work great, but it also can come across as self-indulgent, and really struggle to hold a candle to Elswitt’s phenomenal work on Rogue Nation.

e39qigb,"Yes, but it's because the CIA didn't trust Ethan. The CIA had never had very positive emotions toward the IMF, and Walker planted the seed of Ethan being Lark. Nobody trusted anybody, which is why we got a badass 2 and 1/2 hour long movie.",928hh5

e3augbs,"I've been wrong in the past about motivations for sequels, but I really do think this was the main casts last MI movie. I think Cruise and Rhames are definitely exiting the franchise. However, there is no way there won't be another MI movie. Someone will take the reins as the main guy at IMF. It's the same reason I could see Pegg staying on as the transitional character. 

To me, Cruise, Rhames, Monaghan, and Ferguson all have good reasons to be out of the game altogether at this point. Maybe Cruise does a double back cameo? But I think Cruise is smart enough to know that this movie was an incredible sendoff to Hunt's character. ",928hh5

They talked about how all these foreign governments want a piece of Lane, so the Brits taking him out before any of those governments can speak to him is probably going to make a lot of people very unhappy. If Ilsa succeeds, great: Lane's dead, and MI-6 can quietly bring her back into the fold. If Ilsa fails or gets outed, the UK can safely sit back and claim they had nothing to do with it because Ilsa's a former Syndicate agent they disavowed years ago. It's more about risk management and deniability than trust.",928hh5
e3h17tv,"I would guess they MI6 hired Ilsa because she was already disavowed.  She was expendable, so they have plausible deniability if she fails.  

Lane was already being moved from government to government, so an MI6 sanctioned assassination of Lane might ruffle some feathers, diplomatically.  If Ilsa does it, MI6 could just say she was rogue in her actions (since she was already disavowed).",928hh5
e3ftsdi,"Not much more unrealistic than anything else in the franchise.

Hunt would have been strung out in public after the Russians discovered he'd infiltrated the Kremlin in Ghost Protocol.   Merely being correct about the nuke guy wouldn't have been enough to make them OK with American intelligence operatives sneaking into what is essentially their White House.  ",928hh5
e3gq2ns,"I'm guessing it was Ilsa who came up with the idea and MI6 just went along with it. But yeah I mean I'm not sure why they couldn't have someone else do it since the guy was already caught, it's not like they had to find him lol. ",928hh5
e3j2wlw,"If you watch the trailer again, you see that for the truck shot, Tom Cruise is sitting in a helicopter cockpit, not a truck cab and for the falling off the cliff, the CGI of the crashed helicopter is not present so it looks like he is falling completely as opposed to him holding onto the cable.",928hh5

e3wu4mj,"none of that helicopter chase made sense really and neither did solomon not triggering the bombs himself by messing with the one in his cabin. I legitimately would of done that. ""fuck, IMF team is here. lets get this over with then.""",928hh5
e41u35b,It's not any worse than crashing into the helicopter head-on. The only possibility to even have a chance to get the thing was to down their helicopter,928hh5
e4dd2tk,The standard these days is 20-22 minutes of trailers ,928hh5
e4tdfg6,"When he's running after Walker and makes a rooftop jump to another rooftop and his upper body lands on the ledge of it.

I noticed they left most of the shots of it in because I think they showed it on Graham Norton and without the music and with a slowdown you can see his ankle and foot hit the side of the building at a really bad angle and bend out of place, and then when he climbed back up and tried to run again, he was hobbling.

Honestly I was surprised that they left that much of it in the actual movie. I would have thought they would have used the camera cut to change to a new shot of Tom running but they obviously kept the shot where he finished the stunt while injured.

Lane on the other hand was a spurned covert operative who, probably partially motivated by a personal vendetta, had developed a belief that the existing world order and global politics needed to be destroyed.  And, to achieve that goal, he wanted to use their own network of covert activities against them.

Then, when Lane failed in MI5, he turned to the more extreme method of forcing the world order to collapse by starving a third of the world's population.

Hendrix was a sociopath and psycho.

Lane was an anarchist that had no issue with sacrifices.

e3rnmzt,"So the thing about Rogue Nation and most of the other MI movies is that Cruise kinda influences the cast to try to do as many stunts as possible before switching out with the stunt doubles. (And I think in general Cruise wants the actors to do a lot of stunts, I know Emily Blunt was pregnant during the re-shoots of Edge of Tomorrow, and Cruise gave her shit before Blunt explained that she just got pregnant so doing the stunts was a no go)

But Ferguson got pregnant during the shooting, and so I think in order to hide the double (and without using CGI to replace the face of the person), they increased the camera movement to hide the face more. At least, that's what I thought with all of her flying wrestling moves she was pulling off as the camera followed her around. ",928hh5

Also, this was Ilsa's proving ground, so wanted her too if she went rogue. We're meant to think the Widow wants her dead, but maybe they were just going to turn her in as well.

It took place between the time Ethan dove down to when he climbs back up and catches up to Walker.

Another sequence I liked that was omitted was when the White Widow was introduced and gave her speech in Paris; it was originally her singing Feeling Good. To me, it added a classic spy film touch to the movie (maybe that’s why they cut it, because it felt like a James Bond scene).

If he's so bad why didn't the director just advice him and get better takes of his performance? Maybe it's the character supposed to pretend acting cool till he lose his cool at the end? And that's what happened I guess that's why Chris McQ was ok with his performance? ",928hh5

I think Lark is the one who wants the bombs at Jerusalem, Mecca and the Vatican as per his manifesto but Lane shut him down and put the bombs in Kashmir.

Lane himself has gone a little round the twist (as if he wasn't loopy enough already, but before he was a little more interested in his own self-preservation and less obsessed with Hunt), with his Syndicate goals having taken a back seat to sticking it to Hunt as thoroughly as possible.

Walker won't kill Ethan then because Lane wants him to go to Kashmir and die not only knowing everyone he loves is dead because of him, but that 1/3 of the global population is dead because he couldn't put millions of lives over one. Maybe that's why Lane only switched the tracker off when he got to the medical camp. Still doesn't explain why they need Hunt for the plutonium at that point.

e39k259,"The assassins in the Widow's private area at the nightclub were sent there to kill Lark by other parties who don't want nuclear bombs in his hands (possibly MI6? Remember that that's who Ilsa's working for and that would explain how she would know about them). Hunt passes off these assassins as wanting to kill the Widow too to stop the deal with him, so the Widow takes him to her house.

I think Lark and his agents aren't connected to the Apostles; he is a anarchist third party that just wants plutonium. He doesn't want to directly contact the Apostles for his own safety and cover. He needs Lane because now that Delbruuk is captured, Lane is the next most easily accessible individual at that time who can set the bombs off, and the only way to get the Apostles to co-operate and give him the plutonium is to give them Lane.

Quoting from my previous comment re: Lane

> Lane himself has gone a little round the twist (as if he wasn't loopy enough already, but before he was a little more interested in his own self-preservation and less obsessed with Hunt), with his Syndicate goals having taken a back seat to sticking it to Hunt as thoroughly as possible.
>
> Walker won't kill Ethan then because Lane wants him to go to Kashmir and die not only knowing everyone he loves is dead because of him, but that 1/3 of the global population is dead because he couldn't put millions of lives over one. Maybe that's why Lane only switched the tracker off when he got to the medical camp.

I think the ""voice in his head"" is just his instinct for reading people, which has kept him alive.  And the fact that the voice has no opinion of Hunt says that something's not right.  The voice isn't saying he's a legit buyer, but it's not sounding the alarms about cops or agents or spies or whatever.  Basically, the voice in his head, his instinct, can't read Ethan Hunt when he looks at him.

Even apart from being the latest installment in the MI franchise, it's a brilliantly shot movie and all the action sequences are absolutely amazing. ",928hh5
e3mbz6i,"The beginning of the plan and everyone's motivations are in the mission brief at the start, but it is kind of a lot to take in.  This is how the events are supposed to go, without IMF or CIA interfering.

1. Cores are stolen from a Russian facility. 
2. Cores are sold on the black market to The Apostles. 
3. The Apostles give the cores to John Lark through the White Widow.
4. John Lark frees Solomon Lane for The Apostles and is also given the cores.
5. Lark, working with Dr. Debruuk and Lane, construct 3 nukes and detonate them across the world.

What happens in the movie is Ethan beats The Apostles to the black market deal (#2) and fails, so he now must use Dr. Debruuk to find the location of John Lark (#3).  So what actually happens in the movie is similar:

1. Cores are stolen from a Russian facility. 
2. Cores are sold on the black market to Ethan and Benji. 
3. Ethan loses the cores to The Apostles as Luther and Benji are threatened during the black market deal. 
4. The Apostles have all 3 cores now so Ethan uses Dr. Debruuk to find out where they plan to give them to Lark.
5. Ethan goes to the Paris deal to obtain the cores from the White Widow, who is in contact with The Apostles, by posing as John Lark. 
6. In pre-payment for freeing Lane, Ethan is given one core from the WW while The Apostles still have two. 
7. After Ethan abducts Lane on his own, Lark abandons the use of the White Widow.  He frees Solomon Lane on his own (the sewer scene), abandons the Walker identity, and uses Lane to directly obtain the remaining two cores from The Apostles (unseen).
8. Lane and Lark want to detonate all the nukes at Kashmir, but the IMF/CIA have one core already from Hunt, which is why there are only 2 nukes at the medical camp with Lane.

The confusing part is Lark (Walker, not the Asian dude sent as a proxy) works with Solomon Lane but not with The Apostles.  The Apostles follow Lane since they're remnants of The Syndicate, who Lane led in the previous movie.  I guess extra confusing is that Lane is willing to die in the end to get revenge on Ethan, even tho he is the mastermind behind the plan, which makes Lark seem like the brilliant villain who (almost) got away.",928hh5
e3ldw78,"This confused me for a bit but according to Wikipedia, John Lark isn't actually an agent of the Apostles but is a client of theirs, which explains how it works. Chain of sequence of events goes like this after thinking about it - this is my interpretation but it seems reasonably accurate:

1. Apostles steal the plutonium at the beginning of the movie.
2. They contact the White Widow to broker a deal with John Lark - so Apostles still have the plutonium but gives one to the White Widow so she can give it to Lark to prove that Apostles have the plutonium. 
3. John Lark arranges meeting with the White Widow. Now, presumably, how this goes is that the White Widow as a CIA agent, was probably ordered by the CIA head to go ahead with the meeting because the CIA wants to know who John Lark is. However, unknown to the White Widow and everyone else, John Lark is already at the meeting as ""CIA agent Walker"" and lets Ethan impersonate him.
4. Apostles want Solomon Lane in exchange for the plutonium.
5. Ethan breaks out Solomon, and thus, allows the Walker/real John Lark to use the opportunity to break Lane out and hand over Lane to the Apostles.
6. In exchange for him breaking out Lane, Apostles who still have the plutonium, agree to finish off Lark's mission in Kashmir by detonating the bombs there.",928hh5

I don't think that's accurate even though it'll probably be painted that way in an Honest Trailer or something.  

In MI4, while the threat was nuclear in nature, Hendrix just wanted to watch the world burn regardless of governments.  He just wanted to create a world post nuclear-fallout because he felt that was the natural order and human progression.

MI5 was very different from 4.  It was about spurned former spies feeling betrayed by the system that created them.  It was a much more personal agenda centered around getting revenge on the system by bringing down the old world order.  This is completely different from 4.

With MI6, while it's the same villains due to being a direct sequel, the overall theme is completely different.  It's literally the name of the movie, Fallout, and a key line in the promotional content and movie.  It's the comeuppance for past actions whether it's the mercenarization of the Syndicate due to what Hunt did to their funding in MI5, Hunt's decision to save Luther, the job Ilsa Faust is given due to her time spent with the Syndicate, the result of the deal the White Widow's mom made in the first MI movie, the emotional situation Hunt and Julia were in due to the events of MI3, etc.  It's a movie about consequences that wrapped up a lot of lingering plot lines from the entire series and cleaned the slate.

So I guess, on a very superficial level, one might think the movies are the same.  They are not.

Also, with how British Intelligence treated Ilsa from MI5 until MI6, it's not hard to see why the Apostles would be so determined to destroy the system.  A big theme of MI5 (which has been a recurring theme in the series) is how poorly these government agents are being treated.  They're betrayed, abandoned, scapegoated, and exploited.  Ilsa and Hunt didn't retaliate but that doesn't mean none will.",928hh5

Ethan knew he was choosing one, or the other. ",928hh5

e37c534,Of course they were okay with it. It's a means to an end. Even Walker had orders to not let anyone get the way of recovering the plutonium. CIA has done some crazy shit in real life so it's not even that much of a stretch for a film. ,928hh5

I think Walker didn't care one way or the other - he had a phone that would implicate Hunt to plant on ""Lark.""  Had they captured Lark, it was his duty to turn him over to the extraction team - plenty of chances to plant the phone. 

Of course, that part makes no sense because ""Lark"" was supposed to be a plant by Hunt as a double agent. Why the fuck would Hunt implicate himself????? ",928hh5

Also, when Ethan meet the new husband, reactions are healthy. He is open to appreciate the guy. The new guy is cordial to Ethan. Same with both girls together. It was refreshing to see an action movie where the alpha male is not a ""douche bag have it all alpha male"" and ""all girls hate each other to have the alpha male"".

Action sequences were creative. They explored every facets of the helicopter fight scene. We felt the design team put a lot of thought into it.

Not every movie needs a giant bombastic twist. I was okay with it, when he hands over the phone, you basically know hes bad. But yeah would have been nice if they played it straight and he was a good guy. John Lark being a big villain whos just killed early on in the film would have been unique too.

> Their are a few minor things like why was walker so incompetent? Especially with that skydiving scene?

I think they were driving to make it seem unlikely he would be a bad guy because hes so incompetent lol...? ie Benji 2.0

> Also this Lane doesn't really match with the Lane from the previous movie?

You are 100% right now you mention it. Rogue Nation Lane wanted money to continue his organization, he was motivated. This one... seems suicidal? Just wants to nuke some water supply and hes happy with that..?

I feel like Lane should have died in this film and John Lark should have survived instead. That half face scar is totally an evil guy thing lol

> Why does he head of the IMF die, we don't really care for him do we? 

Read some reviews where they said it worked them, felt bad for the character. From the movie making side though you basically *needed* at least one good character to die to try and show there's some stakes.

What if they *really* tried to make it a suprise and it was just obvious the whole time? It would've been considerably worse imo.

Also, I think he was incompetent in the first act to try and hide is real identity. A cocky meathead jumping out of a plane before Ethan says so? Not likely an evil mastermind. Maybe he was in a rush to get to the rave before his fake John Lark left. Maybe he broke the suitcase on purpose so they couldn't make a mask out of him, hoping to delay the mission. Just some thoughts. ",928hh5

e3lnuhk,"Breaking out Lane plays out exactly like a heist sequence. Sure it's not the impossible heist like the underwater Rogue Nation heist but it's still a heist sequence.


The way they reveal the turn is great it's shown that he's framing Ethan with a fake John Lark phone and then doesn't play it as shocking when the reveal of the turn happens making it being obvious not much of an issue given that the reveal isn't meant to be shocking and instead about when that turn is going to come.


Walker isn't incompetent he's locked into a plan he doesn't want to be in the form of Lane's quest for revenge. Every bad choice Lark makes is either because he doesn't know much about Ethan or is because Lane wants to make Ethan suffer and Lane has what he needs to carry out his goal of causing great suffering to create peace forcing him to go along with Lane's revenge plan rather than something simple. Lane ultimately wants to watch Ethan lose everything so yes Lane isn't the same as Rogue Nation Lane instead he's set on revenge and just wants to watch Ethan losing everyone he cares about and failing to save them while being framed for everything. To that point the reason Walker is seemingly incompetent during the halo jump is that he had to make Ethan make the meetup and kill the fake hired John Lark to assume the identity for Lane's plan of framing him for being John Lark to work which was time sensitive and after Ethan saw the storm he wanted to find a different way. So Walker forces his hand which yes almost kills him which would have prevented most of the rest but he's stuck following Lane's plan so he lacked options. Breaking the laptop during the fight also forces Ethan to play the role of Lark as himself to frame him during the meeting with the White Widow who is a CIA informant rather than behind a disguise of the dead fake Lark.

e388ks6,"It's quite simple. The first 2/3 of the film was all about Walker trying to pin EVERYTHING on Hunt at the request of Lane who was still the defacto leader of the apostles. Walker would not get his plutonium until Lane got his revenge on Hunt. 

Walker more or less created Lark so that he could slap that persona on to Hunt...the goal was to have Hunt in prison and be helpless to watch as everything he ever cared about was destroyed and there would be nothing he could do about it.

White widow was working with the CIA since the start. Her job was to hand over everything to the CIA, in favor of the CIA turning a blind eye to her arms dealing/brokering. She is why Hunley was in London as she ""handed"" over Lark to the CIA all while Walker accused Hunt of being Lark to Sloane. This is the reason for that crazy quadruple cross.

WW never possessed all 3 cores. She was given one core by the apostles to ensure that Hunt posing as Lark would commit to breaking out Lane.",928hh5

e3883xi,"So the apostles are followers of lane. They stole the plutonium in order to get someone to free lane. They do this through the white widow who is a broker for people. The white widow then sets them up with John lark (not knowing he's walker). So the deal is lark frees lane, and then the apostles give lark the bombs. The apostles have given one bomb to WW as a form of pre payment, but the other 2 bombs are still with the apostles.

So walker is really there the whole time to free lane (having been CIA he'd know she is a CIA informant, but still has to work through her to get the bombs). Once lane and walker get away in London, they must have met up with the apostles who had the 2 remaining bombs. 

I'd assume WW has already given her bomb to the CIA, and that's why lane/walker only have 2 bombs at the end.

I thought in general the script was kind of lacking. Certain scenes were begging for some meaningful dialogue but were either clunky exposition dumps or would just fade to some generic Hans Zimmer-esque soundtrack. Lane's ""fallout"" monologue was great but that's about it. And for being IMF seasoned vets, Luther and Benji get more and more inept with each installment. They really didn't have much to do this time around but be damsels in distress. I'm afraid they're just going to be Jay and Silent Bob in the next one. The writers also set up certain things that never paid off, like the initial scanning of Cavill in the mask maker, Zola seemingly up to something counter to sis...I don't know. And where the hell was Hawkeye? Not even a throwaway line about retiring or house arrest?

The stunts were cool and beautifully captured and framed; for all the kinetics it was easy to follow and highlighted the settings but very similar to shtuff we've already seen. And I guess fundamentally that's the problem I have with the MI series in general, it all just kind of bleeds together. Is this the one where he dangles off the cliff or the big building? Is this the one with the motorcycle highway chase or the motorcycle traffic chase? Is this the one with the airplane or the helicopter craziness? Is this the one where they threaten his girl or...?

We see and know if none of this onscreen until Walker outs himself in front of “Solomon”....and Alec Baldwin’s character probably didn’t know until he heard via listening device on Benji that Walker was Lark, thereby returning his full confidence in Ethan once again.

4. Hunt knows Walker knows that Hunt is not Lark - [*spideysense screaming* - remember that the Syndicate, and later the Apostles, as well as Lane are mostly pissed-off spies sick of being used by the system]

5. Hunt sees the 'evidence' - way too complex to be TheoreticalUnlikelyGoodGuy!Walker simply connecting the dots wrong -> Walker=Lark or at least an Apostle with a hand in the smallpox breakout, attempting to frame Hunt -> Walker must have allies in the CIA to be able to pull all this off, no one in the CIA can be trusted.

6. From there, it's easy to guess Walker's aims. He needs Hunt-as-Lark to get the bombs off the White Widow, plus if he's an Apostle/Lark he will want to steal Lane, so Hunt quickly offers to continue the transaction with Benji-as-Lane, pretending that Walker still just wants to get the plutonium back for the CIA and to ostensibly get Walker off his back for 'going rogue'. This nets Walker both the bombs and Lane in his sole custody, and he jumps at the opportunity. Team Hunt, on the other hand, need to clear Hunt's name and neutralise Walker.

He clearly cares for his friends (the luther scene) and will NOT sacrifice them, as he believes that any setback caused by not doing so, can be rectified later (by him)

They established that there's a hard line he wouldn't cross with the police woman scene, and they also pushed the regret from not killing Solomon Lane a good amount.

Also, it's a bit exposition-heavy, but the scene between Luther and Ilsa hit on the relationship bit - he can't have them because it causes major distraction and adds stakes that he otherwise wouldn't have to consider. He knows this, that's why he pushes to keep everyone away. He tells Benji to leave at the start because he doesn't want people endangering themselves for him. 

I think Cavill's character represented an interesting mirror for Ethan, about what he could potentially be like if he didn't have those moral lines he wouldn't cross.

e35ztov,"The movie as a whole felt very Nolan-esque to me honestly. Aside from Lorne Balfe's Zimmer-esque score, it had a very similar aesthetic and similar sort of cinematography that we typically get from Nolan's films. I'm really glad McQuarrie decided to continue the trend of each movie in the franchise being stylistically unique from the rest, I watched Rogue Nation 12 hours before seeing this one and can honestly say that this movie beared almost no resemblance to the prior movie.",928hh5

I also figured out the Lane swap immediately (I also loved the look of dissapointment on real Lane's face when he sees that Walker got duped) .  I love that the masks still play a key role.   Overall, none of the twists surprised me, which I was totally cool with because it made the movie feel much more logical and natural, instead of twists for the sake of twists.

Comic book movies cater to a message or an overall narrative where action and fighting take a backseat to character development and world-building. You’re supposed to connect to the characters and their choices which are usually preludes to conflict, kinetic or otherwise. 

Great films can do both. Loved how visceral this film felt. ",928hh5

Yeah. I think the movie's main failure is that it doesn't get Cavill over as an antagonist.

Why cast motherfucking **Superman** and then have him not be all that impressive? He's twenty years younger and a lot taller and buffer than Cruise; the movie should've played up Walkers competence and then had him lose vs Hunt and Faust working together or something.

ecc83za,"At the end of the day, it's all personal preference. This movie, like I said, was basically everything I would want out of a movie I enjoy. It's not some cinematic masterpiece like Inception but it's the most fun I've had watching a movie all year.  

I agree, you could tell Cavill was going to be bad from the beginning. In fact, the trailers even painted him to be the bad guy. It's the different ways they played Cavill being the bad guy that made it enjoyable. He wasn't just someone looking to end the world. He made it personal by bringing in Julia. The stakes were also raised because Cavill managed to make Hunt look like the bad guy. Sure it's a generic thing to do, but I thought it was creative the different ways Cavill impacted the IMF team and how well he stood his ground against Hunt.  

As for character growth, it felt like a lot of that was done already in the past movies. I didn't sit down to this movie to learn more about Hunt's background or about why he and Elsa seem to have a stronger relationship than just work. All those pieces were already set in place. I sat down to this movie wanting a straightforward action movie. Give me more Tom Cruise running, give me more punches and gun fights and wild car chases. I don't care that it's been done before, it's fun to watch and I'll enjoy just as much as I did before.  

I'm not saying this movie is better than Inception or Dark Knight but I enjoyed all of them just as much.  

And as for your last points, no that doesn't bother me. The same way it doesn't bother me that Leo can somehow plant ideas in people's mind while they sleep or some dude in a clown mask can terrorize an entire city and the only guy that can stop him is a guy in a bat costume. Movies make the unbelievable come to life on screen and that's why I enjoy them movies and that's why I enjoy this one. If your biggest complaint is that MI is unrealistic then maybe it's not the movie for you. But at the end of the day, I had a good time watching the movie and that's what matters for me.",928hh5

Now while he could have done that to sabotage the mission or force hunt to play the game his way, I personally get the sense that he is just more reactionary and looked for a weapon, not a believable way to disrupt hunt.

The exact same thing applies to Maggie Q, who got her first speaking role a year or so before Mission Impossible 3. Paula Patton and Thandie Newton are a little different, as Paula Patton's first lead was actually 5 years earlier, but she had gone 3 years without a credit before appearing in Ghost Protocol and Thandie Newton had been acting for a decade but was at this point fresh off Beloved, which is the movie that made her a breakout star.

Basically, with the leading women in Mission Impossible movies, they went with relatively unknown actresses who had recently blown up in the press and were expected to become even more popular.",928hh5

Everything about his personal life makes it clear that he's a nutjob, but then everything you read about these recent movies especially suggests that he's not only incredibly hard-working but also unselfish and doesn't take himself very seriously. There's a half hour of b-roll from Fallout on youtube and there's a bunch of Cruise thanking and crediting and congratulating the production teams that helped make all those stunts possible and he just comes off like a pretty friendly stand up guy like you said.

And you could chalk all that up to a great PR team, but the movies themselves also bear it out. This last string of films he's done have all featured strong, competent female leads that he's allowed to shine alongside him without the usual action movie sexualization, his co-stars all get plenty of moments to shine, his characters are always fallible and often get the shit beat out of them and need to be saved by others. The last two MI films especially have had jokes at his expense (the height gag in the opera scene in RN, all the moments in RN and Fallout where he's clearly exhausted and clinging on by luck and the skin of his teeth), etc. And these are movies that Cruise has significant creative control over. They could be whatever he wanted them to be, and he wanted them to be this.

But she, on the other hand, could do it I think.  She's interesting enough, badass enough, and she's got enough of her own thing going on (working for MI:6 and not the IMF) that it could be really fun imo.

MI III has him sprinting at length (and its a great tracking shot) down a canal side in..... indonesia (somewhere anyway). MI IV has him running away from the exploding Kremlin, MI V has him sprinting ... actually I dont remember this one. And MI VI has him sprinting for an absurdly long time. Full sprint, great form, high speed, high tension, great accompanying music AND great camerawork.

Benji and Ving cut the wire but the screen flashes to white....slowly fades in to Ethan hanging from the cliff admiring the scenery, he has the plug thingie from the detonator and he spits it out.

But then he would have just merc'd a bunch of American agents. I actually don't know who those men were. Or were they Apostles and they only wanted to kill Hunt because they knew he wasn't Lark?

As for the Apostles' plan being to nuke the water, that doesn't fully track because they were dealing the plutonium to Lark in exchange for him getting them Lane. But Lane was the one controlling the nukes, so why was Lark even involved? I think they just wanted Lane back, and were super down with having Lark build nukes in the process?",928hh5

Problem is, it's hard to equal Cruise's presence in an action film. Like Renner did an ok job, but he's got a different type of charisma than Cruise. And I'm not sure that his type of charisma can carry a franchise like MI. 

I could see Cruise coming back because critics really love this film. In fact, critics just love Mission Impossible. I think Cruise's top 5 highest rated movies (via RT) is MI: Fallout, Risky Business, MI: Ghost Protocol, MI: Rogue Nation, and Minority Report. With Fallout being his highest scoring movie yet. 

Also because Paramount will probably throw boatloads of cash to him and give him free reign to do whatever he wants on the film as a producer as well. ",928hh5

It seems like Solomon is who inspired him but what would saving Solomon do in terms of their plan? He said it himself when he (thought) he was talking to him that framing Ethan had nothing to do with their mission, it was just for revenge.

e382s7i,"Lol yes! His accusations were way too heavy and intense and as he was talking I thought he might be Lark. Then the phone screen thing was way too deliberate so I don’t think they were necessarily trying to hide it. More to build tension like ok, when is he going to betray everyone. ",928hh5
e392nhk,"He's not, but Cruise has a ton of creative control on these things, so who knows where that idea came from. McQuarrie might not even remember. It could be something that just got tossed around in a meeting and ended up being used.",928hh5

e394rwc,Chekhov's crack,928hh5
e3988sm,"Yeah, that did it for me too, not to mention all the stuff he said to make Ethan look like Lark applied equally to him

[P.S.  Though Ethan didn't have the same information the audience had, which makes the sting to reveal even more impressive.  Though one explanation is that Sloan also realized what Wallace said about Ethan also applied to him, and was in on the sting (would help explain her listening in too)](#spoiler)",928hh5
e39apwm,They showed he had some skills for sure!,928hh5
e39i3jm,"Oh, I didn't realize that the phone he gave Sloan was supposed to be the one retrieved from Lark. That's a pretty obvious give-away, though I figured it out regardless. Actually, I was confused in that scene who they were talking about. Weren't they talking about pulling someone out of a river? Did they mean the guy who was supposed to be Lark?",928hh5
e39lhv4,"I didn't mind finally getting some explanation/closure for his relationship with Julia, and I was glad that they made her content and gave her a real, happy life instead of having her out there just pining for Ethan forever, which is what it kind of looked like she was doing based on the end of Ghost Protocol.

But I agree it was lame and clunky to then force in a romance with Ilsa, especially the way they did it where they acted like it was obvious to the audience and all the characters that of course they're in love and have been the whole time, and made so many of her scenes teary-eyed gazing at Ethan (or at Ving while he makes that weird speech about Ethan). Completely unnecessary and not in keeping with what made her so incredibly cool in Rogue Nation.",928hh5

2. CIA doesn't know who Lark is

3. *I believe* the CIA doesn't have Lane: at one point in the film someone talks about how every intelligence service in the world wants a pound of his flesh so at that time it seemed as though the French had custody of him

4. The CIA want to get Lane before anyone else can.

So their plot is to get Lark to break Lane out and hand him over to the White Widow who was working for them, then they'd have both Lark and Lane. ",928hh5

Not complaining, it was a great scene. ",928hh5

I seen Rogue Nation before since I was able to figure out that a lot of what happens in Fallout is directly connected to Rogue Nation. Fallout was pretty damn awesome, it's the best one in the franchise. The bathroom scene is a beast of action fight scene. ",928hh5
e38zabn,I didn't catch it on my first viewing either. But she's talking about Max when she's in the VIP lounge as hunt enters. My mother was a broker. That's what she said.,928hh5

e39lid6,Thanks! Makes total sense.,928hh5
e39kbyd,"Makes perfect sense, thanks. Been reading around and it ties up. Lark wants plutonium, the Apostles want Lane. Lark wants to set up a trade with the Apostles, using the White Widow as the broker. Not sure he needed Lane for anything else. Definitely a convoluted plot, but that's what makes it so unpredictable, you don't know what each character's motivation is!",928hh5
e3afcse,Because plot sounds about right...,928hh5

e3ggqrp,"Lark at that time was known to be a bidder for plutonium. Therefore,  anybody else seeking plutonium would have an incentive to put a bounty on Lark's head, as him out of the picture would mean one less bidder, and thus a greater chance of securing the material at a favorable price. Moreover, secret services that don't have a special relationship with the CIA, like those of Russia and China, may also have a bounty on his head. ",928hh5
e3l15gz,I rented it on Amazon for 4 bucks.,928hh5

e3kslyp,Thanks! I'll try to watch the previous one before I go then,928hh5
e3mcl5q,"Good breakdown, that cleared up a lot. I agree Lark's relationship w/Lane is confusing. Do we know who was trying to kill WW/John Lark at the charity thing?",928hh5
e3lizgu,"Thanks for the write up, that explains theblkutonium. The whole thing was part of  Lane's vision though right? He seems to assume a leadership role at the end even over Walker/Lark, and is prepared to die with the bomb. 

Also why were the apostles trying to kill the Widow/Lark at the charity fundraiser if they needed them to break Lane out?",928hh5
e3lutfc,[deleted],928hh5
e3mvb8h,Yeah Lark is essentially a client which is why Lane frustrated him so much in regards to Hunt and his punishment and why Lark didnt have contact with the Apostles. Also why Lark had to free Lane as payment for the plutonium. ,928hh5

e41y815,"That makes sense re: Fake Lane swap out with real Lane.

Was there ever an explanation what Widow would do with Lane in the end?",928hh5
e59bfyj,Sloane agreed to give Lane back to the British through WW so that Ilsa could be accepted back into the fold. Sloane does this as a favor to Ethan.,928hh5
e5czrrw,It's not a plot hole.  Lane wanted Hunt alive to see what he was going to do.  It was basically Lane's entire motivation.  Walker was under strict orders to leave Hunt alive.,928hh5

Any movie is an all time great hit or an all time great dud, there's no middle ground.

> The way they reveal the turn is great it's shown that he's framing Ethan with a fake John Lark phone and then doesn't play it as shocking when the reveal of the turn happens making it being obvious not much of an issue given that the reveal isn't meant to be shocking and instead about when that turn is going to come.

My problem with it was that I personally felt it was obvious almost the moment he was introduced. It's probably from having seen too many movies but the timing and way he's introduced just imidiately said ""bad guy"". But I see your point.  ",928hh5

Wasn't he? I saw the movie twice and in the initial briefing it's mentioned. But also additionally during the underground exchange - when Walker is trying to pin ""Lark"" on Ethan before Sloane speaks on the phone. 

Ethan says something to the effect of, ""you're the reason we don't have any Syndicate witnesses!""

I interpreted that as Lark having killed the identified/compromised Syndicate agents while still keeping in line with The Apostles who were all unknown. All as an effort to prevent those caught from turning or identifying others. 

I'd even throw in the Doctor laughing during the Fake News segment about the manifesto. Since the Apostles' mission went off without a hitch.

e3fw3b4,"Yep, that's the thing that help simplifies it....you have to look at the motivations.

Walker - He's ""had enough"" he has snapped and wants to burn the whole thing down.   He needs help to carry out his plan(getting nuclear devices + plutonium).

Solomon Lane - Wants Ethan to suffer.  Also somewhat invested in/sympathetic to Walker's goal.    

Apostles - Former Syndicate members.   Somewhat loyal to Lane(hence requiring his freeing in exchange for the plutonium), but probably not operating under him any longer.  Walker clearly didn't connect to them through Lane, but through the White Widow, at least in his John Lark guise which was set up solely to frame Hunt.   

White Widow - international arms dealer that's been working with the CIA in some capacity, probably turning in valuable intel in exchange for being ignored.   Probably also used to stage coup's or other sordid deeds that the CIA wants to maintain plausible deniability of.   Walker likely knows she's CIA affiliated and was counting on her hopefully corroborating that Hunt is John Lark.    Hunt doesn't know because the IMF and the CIA don't trust each other.

So basically 

Walker meets Lane

Lane tells him to talk to White Widow

White Widow connects him to the Apostles, promises plutonium in exchange for him and Lark freeing Lane.

Lane is freed and turned over to Walker.  They go to detonate the bomb.  Ethan comes out of the chase looking dirty as hell.  A CIA contact has just witnessed him agreeing to kill cops and then springing a very dangerous terrorist from custody.    Apostles got what they wanted, White Widow probably got paid, Walker got his weapons.  Lane gets to watch Ethan suffer.  HDGAF about anything else at this point, including his Apostles.

Edit: I agree we needed to see more though. I thought some of the problem was Cavill played it still ambiguous while the narrative showed its hand early. If they had one of the IMF like him, rather than all hate him from the off, or he saves one then the reveal would have more impact.

Walker was all about doing what they need to do for the mission. Should've killed Luther, should not delay the mission and jump, would not risk the mission for anything.

Think of Steve Rogers and how being a bullied kid turned into a Superhero drives him.

Tony Stark has so many relationships and a set of wants and needs that's evolved drastically over ten years, going from Playboy to General in a War.

Risking the mission to save his buddies is something pretty much all action heroes do at some point. 

Why does Ethan do what he does. Was there ever a time when he lost a friend because he chose the mission, and can't do that ever again? What does he do in his free time?

But as soon as neither Benji nor Luther died in the opening trap, I knew they would follow their profitable yet generic formula.

I think that a Benji or Luther death right off the bat would have set the mood and stakes.

Benji and Luther could have also been shot point blank when the obvious reveal of Walker occurred. ",928hh5

Think about what you remember from teh first film.

The slower paced plot that really hangs together, an emphasis on who is where, when, no one just appears from no where when required, where people are matters.

The action is there, but its not the focus of the film, the main set piece is the computer room, hunt hanging upside down, the scene setting suspense and tension.....

The way hunt plays through things in his mind, the way you see flashes of events as he works out what people's motivations are.

The way there are small reveals (often literally), but they hang togeher, and are set up in a way the viewer can look at and go ""ah, I see what you did there"", rather than the ones in this which are out of nowhere just ""look how clever we are"".....

Its the little things that add up collectively to make a film great, and to make a franchise distinct.

This one is just a load of action pieces loosely stitched together. Its mistaken a convoluted plot for a clever one which is what the first one had.",928hh5

Awful. God it was so cringeworthy. I didnt go into this thing wanting to hate it, to be clear, but ended up just shaking my head the entire time. 

When did we lower our expectations as a society? This would've been laughed out of the boxoffice years ago! ",928hh5

Air resistance is really not all that much of a factor in the time it would take to drop from where it was to where Walker's chopper was.

The problem is that doesn't mean others movies can't do the same. Fury Road has an overall narrative. It is pure visual storytelling. The Raid tells a full arc. They have developed characters.       


Action should be part of the story not just shoehorned in between quiet scenes. Thats why so many comicbook movies are forgettable. ",928hh5

In MI:1 the rule is that they have really cool tech that we don’t have in our world.  Everything follows from that. But all other stuff should act like our world. Helicopters can’t ram each other as speed and come out fine. Tiny hooks can’t hold helicopters on the side of mountains by a crevice. And Ethan pulling on it won’t do shit. The bike scene is the edge of believability. It is fine. 

But that isn’t even the worst of it. The plot is terrible. All exposition comes from wooden dialogue. The twists are convoluted.

Don't get me wrong, he's very much a fascinating event director, and The Prestige gets to where it's going with Christian Bale and Michael Caine's unrestrained intensity and creativity dragging Nolan into a place filled with a lot of heart based on someone else's story, but it's kind of unique.

There's a lot of things that are just thrown out there and then the plot moves on and you don't really get time to think about the logic behind it.

I'm assuming that McQuarrie thought about all of this while he was writing it and didn't just write one draft with the basic deception, betrayal, and reveal plot points set and call it a day.

>Thanks for the detailed reply, I actually thought about this as well but it’s still not solid. ok the CIA was working with white widow to set this up, but they still have to convince the real Lark that this plan makes sense but it wouldn’t. The real Lark would ask the same Q, what the hell do you need my services for in this situation?

There's a couple answers to this.

In terms of the logic of the movie itself it actually makes sense because Walker is Lark, therefore Walker already knows everything that's going to happen and isn't going to make miss-step because he's always one step ahead. He's not going to make a screw-up as Lark in that situation because he knows what's going to happen, and in all likelihood he's probably the one that suggested the Paris set-up to Sloane. Although we don't know this 100% because the movie never tells us this, **but** it seems to play very much into Walker/Lark's hands that Lane is the one guy who the White Widow needs in order to make the trade for the plutonium.

Notice how everything that happens with the capture of Solomon Lane in Paris, plays into his hands. He's able to make better decisions because he knows what the CIA has orchestrated. The one thing that screws up his kidnapping of Lane is that Ethan is able to start-up his motorcycle, after it was presumably sabotaged. He probably could have gotten away in Paris and taken Lane from Benji and Luther, if only Ethan hadn't managed to escape the Paris police.

Now, in terms of the logic behind the character motivations, Sloane was honestly kind of stupid to not think of what you said, but then again she gets fooled again and again throughout the entire movie by Walker.

Walker lies to her face about what ""he thinks"" Ethan is doing and what he thinks Ethan's motivations are, and she basically just goes along with it because it confirms her suspicions / plays into her own idea of what could be going on. It's convenient for her to think that Ethan is John Lark and that the IMF have been compromised by Lark and the Apostles, and doesn't think it through any further. It explains everything suspicious that has happened, and allows Walker to take any potential suspicions off himself and shift it on to Hunt.

>Edit: One thing that I just realized may help here is the fact that Lane/Lark clearly knew each other and were working together. I don’t see how this connects to the white widow angle but maybe it can help

I have two theories about this.

One is that Walker/Lark always intended to be involved in what happened in Paris because it was how he planned to get Lane out of custody. I'm assuming here that he needed Lane out of custody so that Lane's underlings (now known as the Apostles) would give him the plutonium. This is assuming the Apostles were the ones who stole the plutonium from under the IMF's nose in Berlin.

In the above case, Ethan trying to stay involved after he failed in Berlin was not expected but Walker worked with it and fit it into his plans to rescue Lane and get the plutonium.

The other theory is that Walker planned all along for Ethan to get involved in Paris and he basically contrived the situation such that Ethan would have to step-in as Lark when Lark's agent (the Asian guy in the three-piece suit) was killed at the nightclub.

This second theory is somewhat supported by Walker himself basically telling Sloane his own master-plan except he substituted himself in the little narrative he told for Ethan Hunt. Remember, he was the one who planted the seed in Sloane's mind that Ethan was actually Lark by telling her that he thinks Ethan, as Lark, sent a decoy representative of Lark to the nightclub in order to kill him and give himself the opportunity to openly act as John Lark without arousing suspicion from the CIA or the IMF.

This does raise the question though, were the Apostles the ones who stole the plutonium in Berlin. Or was it Lark? If it was Lark who stole the plutonium, then he didn't need to do any of that bullshit.

If Lark and Lane were basically on the same side, and if Lark had the plutonium, why did he need to get him out of prison if he already had the plutonium?

He could have just skipped right to the end of his Master Plan that happens at the end of the movie, and activated the bombs.

The movie doesn't do a very good job of explaining if the Apostles or Lark had the plutonium.",928hh5

I really enjoyed the roles played by Crudup and Philip Seymour Hoffman. This was back when Julia (wifey) was still in the mix of things. Of all MI's I think I watched this one the most and is still the most highly regarded because it made me fall in love with the franchise. The 2 that came before it never really clicked, maybe I was just a tad young to understand and appreciate it, who knows.

e36vjtb,"> I think my main confusion was why the Apostles would want Lark and Widow dead at the fundraiser (so said the Wikipedia summary after seeing a somewhat convoluted film haha).

Hahaha yeah. It definitely wasn't clear whose faction those people were working for. Or why they would want Lark dead if he was there to get the nukes. Wasn't that their goal?

> Upon rewatch, Ethan references to Widow that these were Americans. I suppose that's true? Other agents who wanted Lark dead, since that would be another approach. But then he would have just merc'd a bunch of American agents. I actually don't know who those men were. Or were they Apostles and they only wanted to kill Hunt because they knew he wasn't Lark?

Adding on to that, how did Lane and Lark get the nukes? If Widow was brokering the transaction to a 3rd party - they had the plutonium cores. But they wanted Lane as price. If it was the Apostles could they not just proceed without Lane? Or was this just an elaborate exchange to get Widow and Lark to bust Lane out? Does this mean Lark's group had the nukes the entire time? Because they had them in the end. 

> As for the Apostles' plan being to nuke the water, that doesn't fully track because they were dealing the plutonium to Lark in exchange for him getting them Lane. But Lane was the one controlling the nukes, so why was Lark even involved? I think they just wanted Lane back, and were super down with having Lark build nukes in the process?

Right? Like it seemed as though in the beginning the nukes were detonated over religious cities and that was the plan during the FAKE NEWS segment. The Doctor grinned knowingly as the plan went off without a hitch. 

The manifesto was Lark's.

But seemingly Lark ""Guardian Angel"" funded Julia to be at the river's head to execute Lane's plan. As if this was the intention the entire time.",928hh5

She definitely thought so but the movie kind of justifies it with Walker faking evidence and feeding her a misleading narrative of what's happening.

I think 4 had the best set pieces and stunts and was probably the most fun of all the films. I'd put it just a slight notch below 3 but it was all fantastic. 5 I felt was the weakest of 3-5 and seemed like it was going through the formula a little more than doing its own thing.

Over the movies, we have seen time and time again his own agency, his government and his country against him, and yet he does not turn. Maybe you need motivation for why someone wouldnt turn, but I think the fact that he doesnt is a character trait enough.  

The opposite of what you described happened, yes (was there ever a time he lost a friend because he chose a mission. He lost a protege because he *didnt* choose a mission, in prt.3)
This is exactly the kind of stuff you describe. its there. This is why he does the missions, so no one else dies because he shirks his ""responsibility""

>“At the time, when the movie started, we didn’t really have a screenplay, so it was very difficult for us to say who would be in the movie for how long and on what days, and he had a commitment to Marvel. So there was just simply no predicting. If we had a finished script, we would have been able to say, ‘Yes, this will work and we can let you go for this time’, but there was just no predicting what those roles were going to turn out to be.

Had he accepted the role to appear in the [film](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/07/tom-cruise-ian-mckellen-gandalf-magneto-mission-impossible-2). MI3 went through [2 other directors before J.J. Abrams](http://collider.com/mission-impossible-3-alternate-versions/#tom-cruise) each with their own script and plan for the story before it actually started production when they had actors signed on that later dropped from the film. MI4 had J.J. Abrams bowing out of directing but staying to produce (Bad Robot is his company) and gave the director chair to Brad Bird. He never had a finished script for Brad Bird just a rough sketch and ideas. When Renner signed onto the film there was no script. They had multiple script changes too during filming as Brad Bird implemented his vision. Mission Impossible 5 had no script when it went into production only the idea of that underwater sequence which they built the film plot around that lol. MI6 like he said had no [script either](https://screenrant.com/mission-impossible-fallout-script-christopher-mcquarrie/)

""You should have came with me"" followed by ""Ethan only ever cared about two women"" followed by Julia having a husband and being happy with her life followed by Julia ""passing on the torch"" at the end followed by the all round attraction to each other Ethan and Ilsa have. 

They didn't need to kiss, but I think it's a testament to how well developed their relationship is that I actually wanted it to happen. McQuarrie has done an excellent job writing the two and the actors have fantastic chemistry. Julia was the only thing that seemed like was in the way of them having something and they resolved that plotline in an incredibly mature manner where Julia and Ethan have mutual respect for one another and are happy to see them both follow their own dreams. They could have easily turned the three of them into a needless love triangle and instead we got something with far more depth and realism that elevates both the characters and the movie itself. 

That said, I hope Ethan and Ilsa get together in the next film. The franchise is going to have to end eventually and I hope it's with those two riding off into the sunset with the team watching on (I don't care if MI:III already did this).",928hh5

To make thing more confusing IMAX have branded a modified Alexa 65 with their IMAX brand, this camera shoots in the digital IMAX ratio and has been used to sell films shot on IMAX (Infinity War, Mission impossible Fallout). They're capped by digital projection and the mastering process which limits their output to 4K and aspect ratio to 1:9:1

However this is inferior to real 70MM IMAX which has the full IMAX aspect ratio and up to 16K quality, Very few films feature footage from this because it's so difficult to film in. A 70mm IMAX print will feature a ratio of 1:43:1

That said, I've been following Cavill for a while and it's kinda fascinating how people respond to him and his acting.

I notice a lot of the time people say 'this character should be more A, B, C but I feel X, Y, Z about the character, so maybe Cavill isn't a good actor' and then I see interviews with Cavill where he's asked about the character and he says the character is X, Y, Z.

Even if the bomb wasn't counting down, wouldn't it make more sense to keep it with Solomon who was actually there to see Ethan show up and then blow it up??

In fact they made a point of saying they wanted Ethan there but then it was never made clear Walker knew he was there. In other words were they going to blow it up if he showed up or not?

Again I saw it twice, but maybe I'm forgetting something? And we also know they cut out about 25 mins of the movie, so there is probably a lot of dialogue that clears up a lot of this stuff. ",928hh5

Can't be the Apostles as they want to facilitate the trade, and so it wouldn't be in their interest to kill Lark. And it's not made crystal clear throughout that Lark is a third party and not an Apostle- if this isn't understood then it's confusing as to who is trading what with who (plutonium for Lane), and why Lark didn't kill Hunt in the lift (because Lane wanted him alive). The scene in the tunnel after Lark's reveal and the blackout is an absolute mess of three plotlines together (Lark, CIA, Ilsa), made harder to follow by the fact that you can't see anything.

The additional twist at the end that the Widow works for the CIA is messy and unnecessary too- she could have just been the neutral broker. Instead it makes the CIA part of the entire plot to trade Lane for Plutonium and means they inadvertently facilitated the nuclear bombs being made in the first place.

e5bqepn,"I really didn't have to look closely at all. We got multiple close ups of the rope. And you're clearly discounting the fact that the helicopter was falling at speed. That would have put a lot more strain on the rope, and it would have snapped from that stress easily. And that's obviously ignoring the insane luck that the metal hook did not bend under that weight and the fact that it caught a tiny ass rocks TWICE! It was hard to believe the first time, but the second time it happened the theatre I was in started laughing pretty hard.   
  
To me the action scenes in this movie were so ridiculously unbelievable it broke my suspension of disbelief. Tom Cruise getting so damn lucky every time. Drive through crowded intersections like 3 times and makes it out three times like a lucky son of a bitch. I want my action movie stars to succeed because they are skilled not because they bank their success on sheer luck. Or the fact that he doesn't know how to fly a helicopter and flies it really well. It would have been more believable if they just said he's an ace helicopter pilot, nobody would have questioned it. Or the fact that he's rolling down the mountain in a helicopter with two massive openings for the door and a bunch of busted windows, but he never falls out. Again, kind of broke my suspension of disbelief. Or the fact that a 15 minute timer took like 45 minutes. I never understood why they don't shoot the scenes first and just make the timer based on how long that part of the movie is. Instead we have people doing long tasks in an unrealistic amount of short time. These are just coming off the top of my head. The boat scene in France was also ridiculous how they caught him perfectly when he jumped in the sewer, would have been way more believable if he fell in the water and they picked him up. Or when they are fighting the evil guy, and Simon Pegg is trying to cut the rope with a broken bottle. The evil guy came close enough to Pegg that he could have stuck him with the broken bottle  in the neck and ended the fight. When I saw he didn't do that it broke all the tension in the scene for me, because it was such a stupid decision.  
  
These are all off the top of my head, but stuff like this ruined the movie for me. I really liked the first half of this movie as an action movie, with the exception of a bunch of hamfisted dialogue and exposition that wasn't necessary. The action was great, but as the movie went on my suspension of disbelief quickly started to fade as it got more and more ridiculous. I pretty much lost all interest in this film after Walker double crossed the double double cross and the CIA started shooting their own men. At that point I was like wtf am I watching, and I stopped taking it seriously and stopped caring about the characters.   
  
I'm sure people were able to maintain their suspension of disbelief, but not me. Maybe I take mission impossible movies to seriously, but I really do think apart from the cinematography and the fighting choreography, this was movie was way below par. Like a solid 4/10",928hh5

It would have made the movie way more dynamic because they did a good job establishing Walker but if they had him shift into this John Lark persona at that moment (true believer, mastermind, etc) it would have been a lot more interesting.   

Lane was already the villain last time so it would have been great if Lark took over as baddie #1 after the reveal and Lane's somehow obsession for revenge against Hunt was more directly linked to bomb plan failing. I think both baddies would have had a better arc if Lane's ended with him being so desperate for revenge it was almost pathetic and if somehow all of Lark's deceit and subterfuge ended up causing his nuke plan to fail.

After the bathroom scene Hunt retrieves Larks phone and it’s visibly smashed. Shortly thereafter Cavil hands a brand new phone to Bassett, claiming it is Lark’s. 

I found that the director tended to make a point of using the camera to signal to the audience. He does it again later with the hook on the helicopter, a scene that was ruined for me by a stupid interviewer who literally said to Simon Pegg right off the bat, “when Henry Cavil got taken out by the hook the entire audience cheered”, freaking Bitch...

And then right after the helicopter crash, there is a very intentional shot of the dangling hook.

It would be a plot contrivance if she was just randomly there.

You complain about walker being tricked with the mask. Except it made sense to leave the mask making machine there because he knew that’s what they were just doing why would they move it.

Ethan might not have known that walker was bad 100% but he was the only player in the game at that point that he didn’t trust. Given we have just been told that the widow works for the CIA, and if the head of the CIA(or whatever the woman’s position was) was corrupt then he was fucked either way.

If walker wasn’t up to no good he would have had no reason to go into the cell with Benjamin. And hunt would have needed to figure out a new plan after that point.

So it isn't stretched and there is indeed more picture (probably because they filmed with a much bigger aspect ratio and then cropped it for 16:9 or whatever format they wanted). In this case you do see more but the resolution and picture quality isn't superior. It isn't true Imax like we have with Christopher Nolan movies.

My wife and I couldn’t stop laughing at how bad it was. Just terrible all around. 

By any chance, did you like Transformers?",928hh5
e3apiyg,"Yes. Our wonderful wonderful censor board decided to cut any mention of Kashmir from the film. Maybe because it was mentioned as ""Indian-controlled"" Kashmir at the beginning of the film. Was so jarring. ",928hh5
e39fyln,Was Henry Caville on her payroll too? ,928hh5
e3iicsv,"OK that makes sense then. So it was the Apostle's who really wanted Solomon back and frame Ethan and Walker was just trying to please them.

Again I get wanting Solomon back but framing Ethan just makes no real sense to me. Yes, I know they wanted him to suffer, but just kill him or Julia and be done with it. That's WHERE their entire plan faltered. And it just makes no sense because no one would've known who Lark was so it never really mattered. Lark would've stayed a ghost. It's not like Walker had any problem keeping himself hidden as Lark, in fact it did the opposite effect. 

I'm not trying to be stubborn about it, its just a very weak plan that costed them their real plan. But I can at least see why Walker would go along with it now if the Apostle's wouldn't give him the plutonium until he gave in to their plan.  ",928hh5
e3h4ipz,"Sloane was CLEARLY skeptical of it though. She trusted Walker but even she had a hard time believing Hunt would just betray his country in such a fashion knowing all the things he's done for it.

That's exactly why she was on the other end of that call when they tricked Walker. She obviously had doubts because she clearly knew what Hunley was up to, right?'

I'll give you Julia was his escape route in a way but she was never needed if he never tried to frame Hunt. All I'm saying is its clear framing Hunt wasn't really his idea and if he stuck to what he wanted to do, he could've gotten away with it easily. ",928hh5
e3truem,..just when I thought I was getting a hang of things... drat,928hh5
e3khdon,If you saw the movie you'd know that isn't the real spoilers. lol,928hh5
e3bq7vg,"The opinion was wrong bro, no need to be salty about it ",928hh5
e38aoim,Still carried over ,928hh5
e54byfl,"Alright it's clear we can agree to disagree. I don't think overall this movie has better dialogue than Dark Knight, but Dark Knight also has moments of dialogue worse than anything in MI Fallout. The line you quoted is generic but not bad. It's delivered well and is so no one notices. The delivery of the bad lines I quoted in Dark Knight are awful as well as poorly written. I still think Dark Knight is better but it's clear your love for that film has blinded you and makes you think that anyone who likes Fallout better is wrong.",928hh5
e3a62t7,"Yeh, this is the top mission. I've never seen anything like this. Rogue Nation and Fallout now are connected. Thank you",928hh5
e37swar,"I really don't know what your malfunction is. All I know is that it's sad and pathetic. You can hate the damn movie---it's no skin off my back. And you have every right to voice your opinion...Your initial post was completely fine up until the end when you said to everyone,  ""but suck my cock, homes."" You call it harmless but it's anything but.  Saying that at work would get you fired from your job...it's pretty much an ""F'"" you to everyone who liked the movie. If you would have simply left that out, I guarantee that you would not have gotten the downvotes you did and this conversation would never have happened. So why did you do it? What was your goal if not to troll?

And then there's all this nonsense about some commanding officer that you're receiving ""special orders"" from. You know that you can get help for that...mental health is no laughing matter. Just say the word and I or someone else can direct you to some medical professionals who can help you with this.

But in all honesty I ask respectfully, really what's your deal man? You purposely provoked a fight with ""fighting words"" and then bitched about it when people called you out on it. ",928hh5

You are how this sub should be 👌",928hh5

e3p0y0p,Yes...,928hh5
e39uv6w,"I figured that they knew that it was Hunt, and Hunt would work out a plan in such a way that no cops\civilians would get killed?",928hh5
e343m6i,like reading scripts ?,928hh5
e3a4pwv,True. Avengers 3 and 4 were actually 100% shot in IMAX.. Not like Nolan's movies where only some scenes were in IMAX. That was awesome.,928hh5
e3dz15e,The last 1/2-hour of the film happens and the audience doesn't know where it takes place?,928hh5
e39fyzt,"Or at least, did she think he was? ",928hh5
e3jdefw,"I imagine it like this.....

Solomon - Ok Superman, you want me to tell my Apostle's to help you get the Plutonium? I can do that, but you have to do something for me. You have to frame Ethan for it.

Walker - Um, why don't I just keep on being Lark and do more anarchy shit ...

Solomon - Because Fuck Ethan Hunt, that's why. That little bitch got me captured 2 years ago. I'm not letting that shit slide. You want my Apostles to help you - that's what I want!

Walker - (sigh) Sure, whatever. I'll just set up a decoy Lark, get Ethan to kill the decoy. Then Ethan will think he has to go undercover as the decoy to get his hands on the Plutonium. Then, I'll tell the CIA .....

Solomon - Yeah, yeah. I don't care. Just wait by the phone for a call from our broker to pick up your Plutonium or whatever.

(Walker leaves the room)

Solomon - Hiya, CIA team that are really my Apostles. Go get this stuff for this douche Walker and call the Widow once it's done to set up the trade. But here's the twist, ya'll. You tell the broker that we aren't going to give him his shit unless he breaks me out. (laughs) Whadda ya think? It's good, right?

Bad CIA guys - Yep, sounds good to us. Love the twist. We'll go tell the rest of the Apostles. ",928hh5
e3jbpk6,"This movie has an overly convoluted plot just for the sake of it. Having as many twists as possible. People are just defending it because it's a fun action movie, but the writing is all over the place.

If they wanted revenge on Hunt, they could have just killed him and gotten Solomon some other way. Also the whole thing with Ethan not wanting to kill policemen just didn't work for me, there was no point in risking the plan so much, and also he was able to shoot Luther in the chest in the beginning without a second thought about it.",928hh5
e54cy1e,"Mission Impossible is on the same level as transformers movies. My love for the Dark Knight has nothing to do with anything, it's clearly a better movie in virtually every facet. ",928hh5
e3bq9dd,"Heh. Thank you. I know how it is when you just don’t like something that everyone else loves. (Also, the related but different phenomenon where you fully acknowledge that everyone’s criticism of something is right on target, but you love it anyway.)

I’d love to hear from you after you watch Rogue Nation; there’s a lot of faux snobbery around action movies that makes their actual quality as films difficult to discuss sometimes, and this conversation is being such a pleasant exception that I’d love to pick it up again. ",928hh5
