ggdglu8,Can we all just agree mads mikkelsen dancing to this trippy song is the biggest gift of this year.,kg0k8n
ggc9rbo,"Another reminder of how much I love Mads Mikkelsen, he puts on such an engaging performance no matter what he's in.

When I saw the initial play time I thought it might overstay its welcome but I was surprised how good it was through and through. I actually teared up toward the the end when I saw the kid with the glasses at the funeral and realized how invested I was in it. The film really made me think about my own relationship with alcohol in the past few years, especially during this pandemic.",kg0k8n
gh8osww,"I would like to offer my analysis of some of the themes and motifs I believe the film contain, particularly that of water, coldness, light/darkness and inside/outside.

I would first like to establish that I believe outside vs. inside and light vs. dark represent openness, freedom and acceptance versus shame, loss of control and difficulty coping, as it most often does in fiction. Cold, particularly that of chilled liquids, represent resignation or distance, and the temptation thereof. Finally I wish to put forth the notion that water and all things aquatic represent balance and life itself.

Let me start with water, the source of all life. Throughout the film water plays a central part, not only as the alternative to alcohol, but also as a symbol for life itself, living, balance or simply being present and ""alive"". The most obvious case of this is if course the fact that you should, unless you want a hangover, balance your intake of alcohol and water. Water is also the alternative to the somewhat destructive alcohol, but it is also the main constituent of every drink. Also, all life stems from the ocean, and humans die without water, so there's that. But let us look at the way this is expressed in the film in less obvious ways. A characters proximity or relationship to water will often represent how much, or how well, they are living or ""alive"", as well as their relationship to alcohol.

Tommy, the oldest of the gang, drowned. He couldn't handle life, and so his life was reclaimed by the sea. He was also the only one who couldn't swim, a clear parallel. Yet, Tommy had not only lived a longer, but maybe more of a life, than the others, as he was older and was divorced. He had experience with life, and thus he was the only owner of a boat, you know, because the sea is life.

Nikolaj, the bearded psychology teacher, lives a pretty good life. He lives in a house with a view of the sea, and we not only go there later, but Nikolaj even mentions this at his party as one of the signs that he has a good life. He is permanently close to water, close to being truly ""alive"", even if he is troubled by some minor leaking issues. Martin, however, also has a wife, kids and the same job, but he lives nowhere near water. In the beginning of the birthday party scene, Martin drinks water. Plain sparkling water, no lemon, please. Sure, he is living, but living a plain, boring life. When Martin truly starts to live, thanks to alcohol, he takes his family canoeing on a lake, something they haven't done in years. The relationship between Martin and Anika haven't been alive in years, but for ""ten minutes"", as Martin later puts it, it is. In the end, Martin, now having maybe found a spark or way to get back to living (he is dancing again after all this time) throws himself into the sea, into life.

This theme manifests itself many more times throughout the film, it even opens with a bunch of young people enjoying life around a lake. Peter is present enough to notice the struggling student while washing his hands, he also drunkenly jumps into the harbor, but swims, and we later learn he has met a woman and helps a student pass his exam. Almost everything they eat comes from the sea (caviar, cod, prawns), and when they are drunk and loosing their grip on the experiment they fail at both buying a fish and catching one. In the final scene in Tommy's apartment before he dies, water is suspiciously absent: we see Martin feed Tommy's dog, but not give it water, they eat pasta, not seafood, and the dishes are cleaned into the trash and not washed in the sink above.

I would like to quickly include three more scenes and my interpretations. The first one is the fishing scene. Martin, who is now using alcohol to kind of cheat at ""living"", maybe having misunderstood it's purpose in a balanced life, is also misusing the fishing net as a spear to ""cheat"" at catch a fish. The second scene is the fireside 20-questions Martin has with his family. He is embodying an animal and the others are guessing which animal he chose. His wife, a woman who is still somewhat in touch with life, asks him if he lives in the sea. Martin declines. I interpret this as Anika asking him if he is someone who is ready, or even able, to live, but in Martins own mind he still thinks of himself, or maybe knows, he is not somebody who is ready to live unaided by alcohol. He is not a fish. This might lead Anika to let slip her affair to Martin later, as she now knows it is hopeless to wait any more. The final scene is the first scene with Martin and Anika, where he asks her if he is boring. In this scene Martin is reading, and Anika is readying herself to go to work, or as it is revealed later, meet another man. This is foreshadowed by Anika readying herself by going into the bathroom, where the water is, because she is ""living"", and when Martin asks if he is boring, the camera finally brings into focus the poster on the wall: An old poster of seashells. Once alive in the ocean, now dead, fossilized and barely a memory of the life it had in the ocean. Just like Martin. This is repeated a few minutes later when Martin is leaving for the party: Anika is going out, so she briefly visits the bathroom, and Martin is in the foreground failing to live, with the poster in the background. Not to mention another fish-poster in his kitchen a few moments later, like a photo of a Martin that once was.

Now let us briefly cover the many cold moments of the film. I get it, a movie about alcohol is bound to include some ice, but there are many gratuitous frames of cold glasses and ice.   I propose this symbolizes resignation and distance, and the temptation of indulging in this. This is perhaps most notable in the scene between Martin and Anika where they meet in the restaurant and Anika orders a chilled glass of wine, while Martin drinks water. Anika is resigned from the relationship. Some time before this, Nikolajs wife specifically tells her husband she wants fresh cod, not frozen. She is still invested in their relationship, and reminds her husband not to forget this. At the end, the men are battered and defeated by the loss of their friend, and thus they are given cold glasses to drink from. At the beginning Martin is persuaded by the chilled vodka to start drinking and forget his plans for the next day, and later by the magnificently misting drink with a huge ice ball in it. Martin also hides his alcohol under a bag of ice in his freezer.

Finally I would like to discuss the theme of light and darkness, as well as open spaces and confined spaces, as a symbol of control, coping and relationship to alcohol. The film both opens and ends with people enjoying alcohol, and to a larger extend, life, outside in the sun. Nikolaj, the person with the most control and ""best"" life, lives in a bright and open house, with large windows looking out over the sea, drinking openly in his home. Martin lives in a more enclosed house with fewer windows, and frequently sits in more darkness than others, and in the beginning he is visibly more exposed and vulnerable in his brightly lit classroom than his friends. He is more private with his drinking, often standing in front of a large window in his study room. Perhaps this is where he can feel relaxed and in control? Tommy on the other hand lives in a small apartment with few windows, most covered by something, but he is also outside a lot, showing how his character tries to appear as in control to others, but privately is slipping, as he is seen both hiding and stashing his alcohol and deceiving others when it comes to when/how he drinks. 

Peter goes on a journey. He starts of with an open music hall and office, but as the drinking starts to get out of hand, he closes the curtains in both the music hall and his office, and starts to drink hidden alcohol. In the end, after regaining more control, he is seen in bright classrooms helping the struggling student cope. This visual motif is present other places in the film, such as when Peter discovers the crying student and takes him from a brightly lit hallway into a dimly lit classroom, or how the men are dancing and having fun in Nikolajs open living room, then being a nuance in the dark, windowless pub, or how Nikolaj starts by being peed on while sleeping in the open living room, then later pees himself in the small bedroom or how the happy students in the opening turn into hooligans after dark in the cramped tram. One could even argue that Tommy ends up in one of the most confined spaces imaginable.

Does anybody else share my interpretation?",kg0k8n
ggss461,"Loved it, probably my favourite of the year. I don't think the message is as simple as ""drinking can be good for you but don't so it too much.""

I think it was that alcohol can loosen you up a bit but ultimately it's you that has to make the change within yourself. Alcohol made Nikolaj admit to himself he was unhappy with his family life (and exacerbate it) and he makes the choice to improve it. Peter admits he wants a partner and is dating someone by the end of the movie. Tommy perhaps doesn't see much of a life for himself and falls into alcoholism leading to his demise.

Alcohol makes Martin feel good but outside of one camping trip it doesn't make him a more present father/husband. Even when at his drunkest, he refuses to dance despite encouragement from his friends, he's not able to be his true self. It's not til the end when he's suffered loss, connected with his students and decided to try and rebuild his marriage that he's finally able to dance. Alcohol took him on a wild ride, and magnified the positive and negative aspects of himself/his life, but ultimately he had to make the choice to grow before he could feel like himself.",kg0k8n
ghr68it,"Besides the drinking themes, the film is also a box of condensed Danish culture. Everything in the movie is extremely Danish. The pop music. The classical music and choir songs. The high school graduates with red band hats celebrating their freedom driving from home to home in the back of a decorated truck. The fancy Copenhagen gourmet restaurants. The bodegas (pubs) with draft beer. The quotes from Soren Kirkegaard. The diffent types of homes and classical architecture and design. The lakes and the ocean. It is basically an homage to Danish culture.",kg0k8n

gx4ziep,"Just watched the movie, and coming from Denmark myself, I definitely believe the movie doesn't paint alcohol in a good or bad light. It actually accurately portrays just how drinking is in Denmark, though with some exaggerating parts (such as the high school student claiming he drinks 80 beers worth of alcohol in a week, this is more normal for University students).

I my opinion, much of the movie's meaning lies in its opening quote from Søren Kierkegaard: ""What is youth? A dream. What is love? The content of the dream."" Youth is not just a number, it's something you live and stop living when there's no love, of your life and of the world. Martin is going through a rough period of life, for whatever reasons, and for years he has been unable to find the spirit of his former youthful self (the one Anika misses), which is briefly brought back as the excitement of his success with alcohol boosts his mood, making him find the desire to go camping with family, make love with his wife, and enjoying his life. This all blows up when he's unable to control his consumption, and end up in an embarrassing situation that reveals his family knowing about his alcohol abuse, his wife's cheating on him, ultimately ending in divorce.

Before his death, Martin's childhood friend tells Martin ""I'm rooting for you, for you and Anika. It's always been the two of you"". These words serve as a motivation for Martin to rekindle lost love, and while partaking in the funeral dinner with his friends, he sees his students partying at their traditional high school graduation ""truck tour"" celebration, and receives a text from his ex-wife, telling she misses him a lot. This confirmation of rekindling his relationship with Anika and seeing the joyful students that he managed to prepare for their exam finals (to make up for his own subpar performance as a teacher) makes him love again. Love his life, love now, love the world. He finally finds a reason to dance, and let's go in euphoria as his soul, almost in an instant, looks 30 years younger.",kg0k8n

gggf78s,"What a great movie. Second best of the year for me after Trial of The Chicago 7.
I find movies about 40-somethings and middle-age crises very relatable, even though i’m in my 20s. That feeling of being lost and wondering where’a all the hope and promise of being 16 and happy?

Vinterberg is a really great director. This, Festen, The Hunt. All amazing movies.
Freeze frame at the end is perfect.

Also, how hilarious was that cut from them in the store buying fresh cod, realizing they don’t have it, and cut to them trying to catch it? I laughed. Just awesome.",kg0k8n

gtax9l5,"I just finished this move about five minutes ago.

I'm an ex-drinker with ~650 days of sobriety. To me, this whole movie represents the ebb and flow of being a problem drinker.

You start like Martin did at the restaurant. You know you shouldn't have that first drink because you have been doing well and you have other responsibilities that you may need to tend to later. Then you see everyone else having fun and decide to have one. That one drink goes down so damn good and feels so warm that you let your guard down and embrace the buzz. 

In the middle of the movie, it's like the middle of a binge. You feel invincible and want to keep the party/buzz going. Around you, others may notice you are acting like a fool but, in your head, you are the coolest person in the room. Everything is so much more enjoyable, and there is an adventure around every corner. Things are going so well until you push yourself too far, blackout, and fuck up.

The scenes with Nicholaj struggling to get up the stairs and pissing the bed/pissing off his wife, and Martin passed out in the street hit especially hard. I have been in both of those scenarios. After a particularly messing weekend, I would typically swear the stuff off for a few weeks or months.

The climax is the doom and the gloom when the binge is over, and you have to face your consequences. The lighting even shifted from warm and fun to stark white and cold - colors I relate with a harsh hangover.

 That final scene to me is Martin submitting to alcohol all over again. He is trying to make things work with his wife, but the call to fun and antics is too enticing, and he says fuck it and starts the binge again, igniting another cycle of drinking, fucking up, feeling remorse, and rinsing and repeating.",kg0k8n
ggdtbzp,"The fact the film managed to make you so emotionally invested in all four main characters was amazing. Like the scenes with the student who had to retake the year could’ve been extraneous but ended up being so heartwarming. 

And yes, that beautiful ending.",kg0k8n
ggoanb3,Wow that final scene was fucking incredible. It hurts to know that no matter what I do in life i’ll never be nearly as cool as Mads Mikkelsen. He’s something else entirely,kg0k8n
ghk974g,"This movie was fucking amazing, RIP coach. Specs and I are going to miss you.

Apparently this all hit close to home for the director? Don't really get it but they and the rest of their team made a great film regardless.",kg0k8n
gw556v4,"just finished watching this and i really enjoyed it. I see some people saying it wasnt really I happy ending but I thought it was because Martin's reason for getting drunk was in celebration of what was going on in his life (students graduating, wife texting him) whereas the entire movie he was drinking to kind of escape his life? Idk if that makes sense but the different interpretations of this movie make me like it even more",kg0k8n
ggcsviz,"The ending is so incredible in this, maybe the best of the year!

Ties everything together SO well.",kg0k8n
ghy8ptw,"Really love the movie ‘the hunt’ previously from this director so was excited to check this out. He always brings up interesting questions and topics that feel truthful and challenge you.

Another round does a lot of the same. I love how it depicts alcohol. It shows our complicated relationship with it, and as someone with a complicated relationship with alcohol, I appreciate that. You can have great times with it, or it can be your worst enemy. It’s not bad or good, it just, is.

Watching this also made me miss my buds, can’t wait til we can get back to some form of normal.

The movie has a lot of funny moments intertwined with the drama, I think it’s a good balance. All the cast is great too, but mads really elevates this film. What a talent. That dance number may be one of my favourite scenes of 2020. I do think the movie drags a little at times, and I could have done with less of the mads and his wife subplot. Though I think it’s a different film without it.

It’s hard to talk about this movie without mentioning the tragedy behind it. The director’s daughter died during the filming of it in a car crash. She was even supposed to play a part in the film and the movie is dedicated to her. I can’t even imagine what that must be like, and to finish the film still? Thankful, but I wouldn’t have been surprised if he didn’t.

Dug it though a lot. Very danish, asks a lot of great questions and is still a good time. Cinematography is top notch too, I feel like a lot of these films from Northern Europe have similar vibes, maybe because they can all speak like 9 languages? I don’t know, makes me want to check out Denmark. The drinking age is like 16 there though? Wild.",kg0k8n
gh96nbn,"I went into this film totally blind, only seeing it briefly discussed online as a contender come award season, and I’m blown away.

The direction is superb. Mads’ performance is sublime, one of this year’s best. The ending is cathartic. Damn, I loved this so much.",kg0k8n
gpbf16e,anyone else think most movies should be 90 minutes?,kg0k8n
gvejtk1,"I have to say -- I don't think this will be a popular opinion, but I didn't read the ending as Martin as descending back into alcoholism.

Part of why I say this is because I've felt exactly what he felt when he got that first text message from Anika in the restaurant. That scene so accurately portrayed his excitement at knowing she was thinking of him and that his wishes for their future now had a chance to come to fruition. His expression when putting the phone away perfectly showed he'd been completely taken away from the moment and he was dreamily coming back to what was going on around him 

I saw the rest of that scene as his giddy celebration of the new possibility of their relationship -- he and Anika were again possible and he was then free to fully enjoy the joyous moment of graduation with his friends and former students, knowing that Anika was thinking of him.",kg0k8n
ggho0ub,"I thought most of the movie was lower-tier Vinterberg but man, that last scene is just utterly fantastic.

gi0zph0,"I'm in my last year of education and suffer from anxiety and Sebastian's portrayal nailed it perfectly. The very early mornings, the sobbing, the feelings of despair, the knowing you need X grade to make it to where you need to be but feeling like you'd be lucky to even pass, nothing going in, forgetting everything you know when the exam starts. Every bit of it struck a chord with me. 

The actor nailed it perfectly and I hope he has a bright future ahead of him. 

I felt seen by the film (which is kind of ironic when you think about it) and I'm grateful for that.",kg0k8n
ggc250o,"Even with just a general knowledge of Danish drinking culture, I really enjoyed this and it made me reflect on my American drinking culture, particularly college and my friends who've been unable to get out of that mindset.

gi5x28u,"I liked it. The first act was really great, but the second act started to feel a bit grindy. 

However, I decided to push through it and the cathartic release at the end of the film is just perfect. I can see why some people will like it and why some people don't. It's just not for everyone.

I also personally found the comedy rather weak. But the comedy, to me, is the only weak point of the film. Everything else was great.",kg0k8n

Maybe personal perceptions taint people’s interpretation of the final scene. He’s either flying or about to drown.

As fun and heart warming as it was to watch, i also felt it in the pit of my stomach.",kg0k8n
gwsjjxw,"Just finished the movie and I really loved it. My personal thoughts are that the movie did not want to show Alcohol either in Good Light or in a Bad light, it gave a very true picture as to some people can overcome their anxiety and self-esteem issues with the help of moderate alcohol and even achieve success while it can be the reason of downfall for many others. As such I believe the Ending was a happy one as Martin realized that while he has caused harm to his wife and family, he has also caused good in the life of his students and is drinking probably realizing the nature of things. There is no absolution in the statement weather alcohol is good or bad.",kg0k8n

guf3bmc,"This is why I love Oscar movies cause I don't think I ever would have heard about this Danish Comedy about drinking unless it were to be noticed by an awards show. And I'm glad, cause this movie is so my shit.

I don't think a movie has done such a nuanced, detailed portrayal of the culture of alcohol and alcoholism. Lots of American films feel super heavy handed in exploring how destructive or raw/revealing alcohol is and I feel like Another Round explores the entire gammaut. There's the confidence, the easy drinking, the way it weakens inhibitions, the need to perform, the loud/slurred speech, the harshness, the dangers, and the pleasures. Alcohol just exists as this ubiquitous presence that we know is bad but we celebrate and create culture around. 

I know some people were giving high praises to the main ensemble and I didn't quite get it at first, because Mads Mikkelsen just felt like a sad sack and his friends were kind of logey. But you don't know how difficult it is to *act* drunk in a convincing, especially since they are exploring every stage. Sometimes you try to overcorrect by walking cool or wanna get control of your surroundings and that just makes you stick out even more. And I think all that exploration builds up to in that fantastic ending. 

From what Danish friends have told me, this is very accurate to Danish culture and so many of the references and cultural touchstones fit that. And I do think it can transcend to any country that has a huge drinking culture? Like at first it felt too overbearing when one student he has up to like 50 drinks per week, but then I thought about how like college kids will pound light beers like nothing. The juxtaposition between the joy of inbridled youth in the beginning when they were doing the beer relay and then when the adults begrugingly want to re-experience that joy after a tragic event. 

This would have been one of my favorite movies of last year if I saw it then, but it's certainly one of my favorite foreign films now.",kg0k8n

No exaggerated plot, characters or acting.  even if you are not going through your midlife crisis, you can really understand them and kind of relate to them, that feeling of loosing purpose and motivation, just going through life day by day without any passion or excitement. it can get really hard, even when there are no serious problems in your life, this feeling of stagnancy could really drain you.

Mads Mikkelsen was amazing through out the movie, but the final scene was just the  crème de la crème of his performance and the entire movie.

ggcfr4e," Thomas Vinterberg is undeniably a great director and in this film he does a fantastic job of balancing tone. Another Round ranges from hilarious broad comedy about drunks to a pretty sad character drama with identity crises, divorce and death, all switching back and forth in natural ways that don’t feel like two films are clashing against each other. The performances are great and it’s a testament to the other actors’ talents that they weren’t overshadowed by Mads Mikkelsen. However, the film feels a little too long and its message is very muddled. At the same time it seems to be glorifying alcohol as a wonderful enhancer of life and vilifying it as an addictive destroyer of life. And of course that’s exactly what alcohol is and its merits strongly depend on avoiding excess. So is that it? Did Thomas Vinterberg take two hours to tell us grandma’s lesson that everything is good in moderation? And what lessons have the characters learned when they end the movie partying right after facing the worst possible consequences of drinking?",kg0k8n
ggrom4h,"OK, so I watched it tonight, to my credit, I, an almost-total teetotaler, matched the guys by taking a sip of whiskey tonic each time they drink.

This didn't seem like a novel or interesting concept for a movie. These guys aren't the first people to do regimented experiments with drugs, and if I wanted to watch people being drunk and occasionally acting like idiots, there's a lot of real life examples I could view instead. 

At the end of the day I'm not quite sure what this film's message was. Alcohol is fun but also bad? We knew all that already.

Surprising to see all these people saying they were laughing/crying. I don't think I laughed once, definitely didn't cry.   

I'm not really sure one becomes an alcoholic just by drinking heavily for a couple weeks. There's a strong genetic component.

I don't know if it's that I don't get the Danish drinking culture (I know that basically everybody there drinks on every occasion and if you don't, you just don't socialize with people because they get insulted by sober people), but the plot is so unappealing to me. I didn't like any of the characters, and I genuinely don't know if we're supposed to? I could never tell what the film wanted me to think of them. Because I thought they were all stupid, terrible people, but I think we're supposed to be rooting for them? Or rooting for Martin, at least.

""He's free"" ""He's finally in the moment"" ....sure. He should've cut back, all of their lives got worse from the experiment in alcohol saturation. Celebrating him that he didn't stop drinking makes no sense to me. His ex-wife misses him and so he goes and gets shitfaced again. Hooray.

Movie required a great deal of suspension of disbelief. Little details like him slurring his words at 0.05 is pretty ridiculous. Their inability to just put 4 shots in a water bottle at home and NOT have to hide 3 f'n liquor bottles at the school, at work, is ridiculous. Day drinking is exhausting, too, you get tired in the afternoon and wake up feeling horrible. All these scenes of them binge drinking at home by themselves as if that's some worthwhile good time unto itself? A four of these guys the same way? Only one got addicted, at least there was that. Drinking like this fucks up your sleep, makes people more irritable in the long run, and is goddamn miserable by day 3.

ggk6t28,"ultimately, the preconceptions you bring to it will affect how you interpret the content, but the way i see it, they started this ""experiment"" in order to change themselves. they were cloaking it in this pseudo-academic language, but for martin, it was clearly an attempt to awaken some life within himself

and once they began enjoying it, rather than staying on that even keel, they wanted to just keep pushing, because that's what happens when you're chasing a particular feeling. first martin pushes himself to 0.1%, then they enter 'phase 2' of the 'experiment' as an excuse to down cocktails and go wild, etc. and naturally at a certain point this means their ability to stay functioning alcoholics has vanished and it's spilling over into their lives. which, of course, started screwing their lives up

tommy, who was completely unmoored from anything in life worth staying around for, couldn't reel himself back in. the other three could - they had reasons to get their lives back in order. and although the movie does end with them drinking again, and with martin going into his ballet moves, i don't think it can either be 1. straightforwardly a sign that he has recaptured his inner life or 2. an ominous indicator that he will collapse into drunkenness again. i think it ultimately depends on whether they have something in their lives which provides the meaning and the foundation to make them want to keep themselves in check",kg0k8n

Ironically for a film that is literally about addiction, the arrival fallacy and trying to maintain or get that high that is always within reach but never quite obtainable, that ending is literally what summarises that all up for me. I kept going back rewatching it, trying to get the same rush of endorphins and the catharsis that came from it the first time I watched it today.

I literally had tears streaming down my cheeks watching him run around. Not to mention it reminded me of Beau Travail's ending which is a masterpiece in its own right.

In a shit year like this with all that's happened, seeing that sense of euphoria and pure emotion displayed on screen was so so special and I can't thank Vinterberg, Mikkelsen and co. for making something like this. This is a truly, truly special film.

i0pmdce,"I’m very late here to this discussion but I think the end is ambiguous on purpose and leaves it up to the audience’s own interpretation, which will be coloured by their own relationship with alcohol. The final shot is very smart; he’s either flying, or he’s drowning. That’s booze for you. 

I had that feeling of dread too; I enjoy a drink myself and being only 23 I’m still out binging most every weekend and maybe even a day or two somewhere in the week from time to time, but addiction runs strong in my family and I’ve watched it eat up friends and tons of other people I know too. I live in a country with a massive drinking culture and I loved how it was represented here. Alcohol isn’t completely empty and hollow like it’s often dramatized; it’s fun, it’s enticing, it can be the catalyst for some amazing moments in your life and it can turn you into a version of yourself who you like a little more for a while. But the undertow can suck you down and drown you if you’re not careful and that’s exactly what the ending represented. You fly or you drown. What one it ends up being is down to each individual person, their life’s circumstances, what they get out of drinking and what their relationship is to booze. Fantastic ending.

I personally see it as a celebration of life and the moments you can share with those around you when you let your inhibitions down and live in the moment, influenced by alcohol or not. Martin’s main issue was that he wasn’t present in his own life and he was emotionally distanced from everything around him; alcohol definitely has its way of temporarily placing you in the here and now, but you don’t need booze to do that either, although sometimes there simply is nothing more life-affirming than a booze-filled dance and celebration.

Despite the fact that he was having fun the alcohol was really a band-aid and didn't make him more present. It was only after he'd gone through everything; lost a friend and a marriage, that he was able to get back to his old self. He was engaging with his students, looking to rebuild his marriage and he was finally able to release his true self, which came out as a dance routine.

I was lucky enough to catch the film at a cinema in October and also saw it again just two days ago.
At my first watch I also thought Tommy committed suicide, because the conversation Tommy and Martin have at Tommy’s door just seemed like a farewell. 
But now, after rewatching it, I think it can be more described as an accident of a man, who wasn’t very keen to live anymore, but didn’t actively try to kill himself...if that makes any sense. He tries to put on the life jacket, before going in the boat, but he’s just too drunk and therefore too clumsy.

Throughout the movie, even at the very beginning at the Happy Birthday party, he always almost backs off from alcohol, but in the end he still comes back to it. I interpret his final jump in the water as the sort of a foreshadowing of his eventual fate being parallel to that of Tommy

I think the final scene is incredibly sad in its fatalism nature, depicting Martin's inability to change and being dependent on the alcohol to bring him happiness. Even though he seems to dance and enjoy the moment it's an illusion of freedom, the kind of an illusion that the booze brings. Eventually the drink will do to him, what it did to his friend",kg0k8n

gtax8pb,"I just finished this move about five minutes ago.

I'm an ex-drinker with ~650 days of sobriety. To me, this whole movie represents the ebb and flow of being a problem drinker.

You start like Martin did at the restaurant. You know you shouldn't have that first drink because you have been doing well and you have other responsibilities that you may need to tend to later. Then you see everyone else having fun and decide to have one. That one drink goes down so damn good and feels so warm that you let your guard down and embrace the buzz. 

In the middle of the movie, it's like the middle of a binge. You feel invincible and want to keep the party/buzz going. Around you, others may notice you are acting like a fool but, in your head, you are the coolest person in the room. Everything is so much more enjoyable, and there is an adventure around every corner. Things are going so well until you push yourself too far, blackout, and fuck up.

The scenes with the Nicholaj was struggling to get up the stairs and pissing the bed/pissing off his wife, and when Martin passed out in the street hit especially hard. I have been in both of those scenarios.

The climax is the doom and the gloom when the binge is over, and you have to face your consequences. The lighting even shifted from warm and fun to stark white and cold - colors I relate with a harsh hangover.

 That final scene to me is Martin submitting to alcohol all over again. He is trying to make things work with his wife, but the call to fun and antics is too enticing, and he says fuck it and starts the binge again, igniting another cycle of drinking, fucking up, feeling remorse, and rinsing and repeating.",kg0k8n

3. The ex-wife was cheating. Doubt it was with Tommy, since he was also spending all his time with his friends.

I don't think the point was to show balance of alcohol as much to just show the spectrum of good and bad that alcohol has. TBH, drinking all day to keep your BAC 0.05 is not good balance at all. It helped them perform better at work and be more confident and had a short term improvement in their personal lives, but at the risk of their jobs, professional/personal/self respect, relationships, addiction and their lives. It shows alcohol as a coping mechanism, such as in the case of that young kid drinking to pass the exam, and being pushed by a teacher to do so... Things will not end well for that young man. I was even bothered a bit by the end. He was doing so well to avoid alcohol, but then had a drink to celebrate his friend who died from alcohol related problems (wasn't clear, was it suicide or an accident, or did he die on the boat of liver disease or something?).

However, it isnt all doom and gloom either, they would continue on with joy, wonder, loss and moments of dancing perhaps with a beer.

> Ironically for a film that is literally about addiction, the arrival fallacy and trying to maintain or get that high that is always within reach but never quite obtainable, that ending is literally what summarises that all up for me. I kept going back rewatching it, trying to get the same rush of endorphins and the catharsis that came from it the first time I watched it today.

Are you sure the movie is about addiction?

I think it's a celebration of alcohol as something that helps people live in the moment, discard their anxieties, and so on.  The addiction stuff and the ""going too far"" scenes are there for the sake of honesty and humor but the movie is somewhere between pro-alcohol and dodging the issue altogether.

Tommy's alcoholism is presented not as a disease in itself but as a symptom of the emptiness of his life (no family and in particular no children).  This is against the widely accepted idea of alcoholism these days, which is that it's a innate/biological/genetic disease that some people have, irrespective of the facts of their lives.  The other three stop drinking on a dime and this is presented as the result of them having things that tether them to the world (family) whereas Tommy is adrift.",kg0k8n

gmvaxwp,"He used the drinking as a means to change his life in a manifest way, and it ended up mostly changing his psychological perspective of it. What I mean is his ultimate realization of his locus of control. 

The student has a similar epiphany (in my eyes a microcosm of the teachers' experience) while giving his dissertation on anxiety according to Kierkegaard, realizing it was the idea/fear of failure, not the act of failure that controlled his anxiety. Mads has a similar realization, it is subtle, but it happens in class with the students. Where a student in his class jokes that he has appeared to have lost his ""newfound"" vigor (due to him now being sober), and instead of drinking or lamenting, he smiles and responds in a jovial manner that was previously impossible without alcohol there, showing us his breakthrough and catharsis.

This is displayed more obviously in the final scene with the textual exchange with his wife, the conversation with his friends, and his matured perspective of the substance. To drink as a means of self expression (the dancing), but not as an end of means or a totality of the self (living/dying for the drink). If anything this movie demonstrates Martin's ability TO change, the pitfalls of the lengthy process of self-discovery were necessary, and ultimate catharsis proved as much. 

P.S I feel the movie does display your concerns with alcoholism and the inability to change, but with Tommy's character not so much with Martin.",kg0k8n

I point the control part to alcohol, even when they stop the experiment and his friend invites him for another beer he says to his friend take it easy, not dont do it.

ggi1sdy,"> You can't say Tommy's alcoholism wasn't presented as a disease, because most people are not humanly capable of going on that kind of bender. It don't believe everyone's alcoholism ""awakens"" at the same time and in the same way.

My point was this: we, today, understand alcoholism to be a disease in the same way cancer is a disease.  You have it or you don't, it's a question of genetics, biology, innate properties.  It does not have to do with the contingent facts of your life.  We tend to view depression and mental illness the same way.  Everything can be wonderful in someone's life and they can still be depressed (I know people like this, or think I do).

In the movie, a clear decision is made to show Tommy's alcoholism not as a disease (in the way I outlined above) but as an existential disorder that hinges on the contingent facts of his life (which meshes nicely with the Kierkegaardian subtext).  There's no other way to view Tommy lamenting that he has no kids and will never have them.  Or his last conversation with Martin where he tells him to try to get back together with Anika so Martin can avoid being like him.

I think the movie presents alcohol as a useful tool to lower inhibitions and be more present in life...as long as you have something worldly and solid in your life to give you a reason to stop drinking.  Whether or not this is actual (whether it matches up with the experiences of actual alcoholics), I have no strong opinion.",kg0k8n

These two quotes from the director are very revealing:

(ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND ALCOHOL): “To begin with, we wanted to celebrate alcohol,” Vinterberg said. “But the same thing that can actually elevate conversation, art, politicians, also destroys families and relationships. So we wanted to look into the **mental balance of liquor**.”
