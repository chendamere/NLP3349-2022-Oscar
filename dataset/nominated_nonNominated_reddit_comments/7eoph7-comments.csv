dq78gu8,"Everyone at the cinema laughed at Mama Coco's ""Who are you?"" at the beginning of the movie while talking to Abuelita, but I found it so heartbreaking, just seeing that sweet great-grandmother not able to remember her own daughter's name...

Great film, might be one of my favorites from Pixar in terms of the amount of heart that was put into it, and the great human connection that it made us strengthen with our own family.",7eoph7
dq6w1a2,"If you are worried about this movie aping *Book of Life,* fear not! They're about as alike as two Christmas movies. Totally different stories, just a shared culture and color palette. ",7eoph7
dq7d60r,"""I'll play Remember Me!""

""No, not that one.""

I wonder if Hector said that not because it's too popular, but because he's still bitter about De La Cruz stealing his lyrics (and also obviously sad about it because he wrote it for Coco).",7eoph7
dq6k1k4,"I was so glad that the main message was not another generic ""chase your dream"" but rather about family",7eoph7
dq73my1,"The Frida Kahlo part was brilliant, I could completely see it as something she would do, especially being a metaphor for birth where she gives birth to herself and then feeds her own selves. Also, fire!",7eoph7
dq6jsap,"I’d kill for high quality stills of the city of the dead. 
They talked about how they made it the beginning of the movie and they weren’t exaggerating it’s beauty. ",7eoph7
dq7go80,Those last 10 minutes. Crying my eyes out. Incredible movie. But fuck that frozen short. ,7eoph7
dq6l5u6,"When the true reason Remember Me was written was shown, me and my girlfriend couldn't keep it together. The film was beautifully animated, the songs were sung gorgeously and the story reminded me so much of my own family in Mexico that I couldnt help but relate to a lot of Miguel's life. One of the best Pixar films in the last decade for me, hands down, and I cant wait to go re-watch it with my Father to get his reaction!",7eoph7
dq9hz3j,"I know it was a minor scene, but when Chicharrón was forgotten. It was such a poignant and moving scene, especially the drink.",7eoph7
dq9l1db,"This is likely to be my favorite movie of all time.  I'm a 37 year old Mexican American, and although I'm no longer the Miguel, I identified with his family so much.  His abuela is MY abuela.  Mama Coco is my Mama Antonia.  I recently lost my grandfather just under a year ago, and this film reminded me of him so much.  He was always big about Dia de Los Muertos and would go back to Mexico every year to visit his parents graves.  

There's just so much that I identified with in this film.  From the chancla, to the Abuela always wanting to feed you, to every freaking detail that they got right.  I feel so thankful for Pixar having made this movie.  ",7eoph7
dq7gw7k,"The amount of complaints I have gotten at my theater because of the Frozen short is unreal. 

The last time I got this many complaints about a single movie was probably from old ladies walking out of Wolf of Wall Street because of how offended they were ",7eoph7
dq7wsvg,"I laughed my ass off during the frozen short, because a kid in my theater halfway through it said, ""I wanna watch Coco.""",7eoph7
dq6pfnn,"What an emotional ending. Coco reminded me of my Abuelitas which  made it that much more powerful a movie.

That said there were no subtitles for a lot of the Spanish speaking parts, especially the songs. As a Hispanic American I had no problem understanding but if someone who doesn’t know Spanish listens if may not be as powerful.",7eoph7

Fuckin' de la Cruz...",7eoph7

dq6pgjx,"The big differences in the concept of one character murdering another between The Lion King and Coco is that in Coco they are humans, while in The Lion King, they are animals. ",7eoph7

dqdyeu6,"As a guitar player, the attention to detail with the guitar fingering was cool.  They actually show the correct chords.

Also, that frozen short was terrible.",7eoph7
dq9of8j,"Wow...what a hell of a movie.

When the first trailers came online I just thought this was going to be another mediocre film by Pixar, but damn was I wrong. This movie was the best, in my opinion, since Toy Story 3.

The characters, the way they set up why music was banned in the beginning was great, the art style and the heart of the film was all there. 

I loved Dante, he wasn't an annoying animal sidekick, he actually helped drive the story and I loved how he and Pepita came back at the end and visited the family. Also did anyone else notice how Ernesto's horse, in the film that was shown briefly, was also named Dante? I love that small detail.

All in all this was a fantastic movie. I loved the characters and the heart. The last 10 minutes was pure bliss and I will totally see this again.",7eoph7
dq6i3sy,Towards the end I thought I finally got through a Disney Pixar movie with my heart unscathed.. and then Miguel sang to Mamá Coco.,7eoph7
dq6gxwg,My showing started at 7. The movie actually started at 7:40. ,7eoph7
dq6hrvf,"I'm actually quite surprised that this film went into dark territory with Ernesto and Hector's deaths. I also did not expect to hate the ever-loving fuck out of Ernesto by the end of this film. It was such a nice turning of the tables. Pixar, you did it once again.",7eoph7
dq80jsk,"The whole thing was a metaphor for my attitude towards animated films. Following the trailers for Sherlock Gnomes, Peter Rabbit, and Ferdinand, as well as that atrociously long Frozen nightmare, I wanted to blow my brains out. Then this comes along and reminds me that there are good animated films and it's memory is resotred, allowing it to continue living.",7eoph7
dq6le47,"Just came back from a late night showing and... wow. I was told there'd be tears and I'm not ashamed to say there were tears. I loved how they handled the Land of the Dead. It kind of reminded me of Terry Gilliam's Brazil with the bureaucracy and retro technology yet still with a much more vibrant palette. The music was top notch and ""Remember Me"" is a clear contender for Best Song. Loved it, had a wonderful trip into this world, and I think it will be a picture people will love to visit numerous times.

On the point of Olaf's Frozen Adventure I am one of the two dozen people that has not seen Frozen so I was very ""meh"" about the thing. The animation was good, had some fun parts, but I think it's perfectly fine to use it as a chance to get more snacks from the lobby.",7eoph7
dqe8scz,"When Hector was singing “Remember Me” to infant Coco I was literally clenching my jaws shut tight so as not to start weeping. 

Having a little girl that I adore, that scene just smeared onions all over my face. ",7eoph7
dq6kra7,"I wanted to tell you something that happen when I saw this movie a few weeks ago. it might help you illustrate why this film is the most successful ever in the Mexican market.

After going to the bathroom waiting for the screening of ""Thor"", I saw an elderly granny crying her eyes out, what I assume was her daughter was holding her tight, telling her ""Esta bien, es verdad"" (It's okay, it's true) She was whimpering hard and telling her over and over again ""I miss them all, I miss them so much, my papa , my mama, I want this film to be so true"". 

It dawn on me how special this movie is for the folks at the sunset of their lives, I noticed so many red eyes in the elderly that were present in my screening, when I finally saw it.

As a 35 year old, as a mexican, that last song reminded me of my loved ones that are no longer with us, how special is the culture of my country that for one day out of many, we refuse to forget and we celebrate with love for those dearly departed.

Suffice to say, I absolutely adored this film. Pixar just gets it, on so many levels. It breaks my heart reading here doubts that the movie is not going to do well due to the country that it decides to celebrate. It's my hope that deep in their hearts of the international community a seed can be planted of love and understanding, and there's a culture in Mexico that firmly believes that those who have left them, will forever live deep in where's said love lives.",7eoph7
dq9jzhi,it's something about animated films with culture that do it for me. The contrast with the bland ass frozen short was overwhelming. This movie had so much flavor. Loved it ,7eoph7
dq7bczu,Did we need a future film in front of Coco Jesus that thing was long,7eoph7
dqk31h8,"So I've had some thoughts about Dante's role. It's a lot to go over, so I won't mark all of it as spoilers. 

**Major spoilers below**.

Dante attempted to do some key things to steer Miguel in the right direction, like trying to bring him back to Hector and keeping him away from going to see de la Cruz, but I can't help but think that the most important part of the whole movie happened as a result of Dante himself. 

Right after de la Cruz throws Miguel off the building, Dante attempts to rescue Miguel but can't do it alone. Until Imelda's spirit guide rescues Miguel. However, thanks to Dante's attempt, Miguel lost the picture Hector gave him.

It seems as though with this picture lost, Hector's final death was inevitable. However,

Because Miguel no longer had Hector's picture, he desperately attempts to get Coco to remember him herself, because it's the only option he has left. And against his family's wishes, he plays her fathers song for her, giving Coco one more burst of life as she perks up and sings along with Miguel, reminding her of Hector one more time. She goes on to tell the family stories of her parents, and to retrieve all those letters and lyrics Hector wrote for her. Including the original torn piece of Imelda's photo, restoring Hector's memory as not just some random picture on the side; but as a true member of the family.

Music is reintroduced to Miguel's family, his family is united more than ever, and now the world knows the truth of Hector's importance as de la Cruz's songwriter. All thanks to Dante's attempt to rescue Miguel. He really was a true spirit guide :)",7eoph7
dqcjpx7,"I am telling you when I left my screening, everybody had either dried tears rolling down their faces or red eyes where you know they recently just cried. Shoot, the screening’s security rep was in tears once I passed him.

This movie has the “Kubo and the Two Strings” effect where you question why the film is given its title, but until the very end, you both realize the meaning behind it while crying your ass off after you're blown away by the magnificent story it told.

Several years ago, I reviewed “The Book of Life” which was one of my favorite animated films of 2014. Because of that review, director Jorge Gutierrez followed me on Twitter, and my tweet was used for marketing. 

So if anything, I feel like I’m qualified enough to be the descriptor of the similarities between that and “Coco,” BY SAYING THERE ARE NONE  

The only similarities “Coco” and “The Book of Life” share besides their lead characters crossing over from their real world to the land of the dead is that both films are a joyous celebration of this special Mexican holiday that has never been displayed in cinema before. The art styles are different, the narratives are different, and the settings are uniquely different. This widens the eyes of young viewers who are unbeknownst to holiday Dias de Los Muertos. The way how these movies appropriate other cultures through the film with a sweeping story and hitting home every tradition the holiday is all about is a welcoming change and should be followed by other animation studios.

dq6grh9,"Best Pixar movie since Toy Story 3.  I fell in love with the music and the characters.  The twist came out of no where too!!  Although, did anyone else notice how the ending was almost exactly like Monster's Inc.? (With the cameras catching his confession?)  Anyway, I plan on seeing it again since it had a ton of foreshadowing.  Also, I may or may not have cried a little.",7eoph7
dq7cuhy,"Loved this movie! Great celebration of heritage, great music, and a intriguing story.

[Did anyone else wonder how at the end, De La Cruz's legacy was demolished, and Hector's story the new focus of celebrity? How was this truth brought to light in the living world? Just the word of a kid who says he went there?](#spoiler)",7eoph7

What they nailed most perfectly is to not fuck with a woman with her chancla.",7eoph7

dq6jv2i,"What's up with that long ass Frozen short?

Still, Coco was a good ass movie. Great visuals and the story wasn't too predictable. Went with my gf to go see it and it made her cry. Found myself fighting back tears too.",7eoph7
dqdo4vu,"Adults sobbing, children having to be carried out of the theater screaming for their moms. Good movie. ",7eoph7
dq6gzj9,"Few thoughts:

1) I expected to walk out with a 'meh' but ended up loving it! (I doubted that a childrens movie about death could be anything but depressing)

2) The other pixar cameos in the beginning werent subtle but were great.

3) The music was phenomenal!

4) The twist caught me off guard completely!

All in all, another homerun for pixar!",7eoph7

 With Abuelita Coco and her memory loss really hit Home. Beautiful movie ",7eoph7

dq73wu5,This movie is incredible. Toy Story 3 good. My wife and I pretty much bawled the last 10 minutes of this.,7eoph7
dqbhyh6,"I'm late to the game but no movie has ever made me cry so much. I'm not even Mexican, but Filipino culture is just so similar. We don't have Dia de Muertos, but we have All souls day where everyone goes to cemeteries to see their loved ones who have passed away. It struck the right values, especially the importance of family.

The abuela's jiggly arms every time she threw a chancla (we have tsinelas in Philippines) was such a hilarious detail.
 10/10  ",7eoph7
dqbtcvy,"One thing I haven't seen anyone mention yet is the amazing use of papel picado to give us the background at the beginning of the story. It was so beautifully and creatively done and once I saw it, I knew we were in for a treat. Loved this movie and will be rewatching for sure!",7eoph7
dvgtfw3,"Man, this movie hitted me hard.

I am Mexican, from a very traditional family who sets ofrendas each year and we talk about our ancestors and stuff, that sure got me emotional.

But the hardest part is that mi abuelito passed away last month, and mi abuelita is in the same mental/physical state than Coco, she stopped recognizing people from time to time.

Somehow, maybe in her dementia she started ""hating"" my grandpa, for whatever reason she would be like ""that man surely is with another woman!"" and stuff. Then she became abscent minded for a long while, at first she didnt knew her husband had passed away a month ago until someone told her, then she fell into a long, long slumber. 

I traveled to see her and stay with her last week, she kissed me and gave me her blessing, I want to think she recognized me even if she didnt said my name and I hope she forgives my grandpa, I know he will be waiting for her with their beloved dogs. :)

So  yeah, loved the movie even if it made me cry a river!",7eoph7
dq6s7zb,"Ughhhhh. Words cannot describe the feeling I got watching this. Truly what makes Pixar and Disney what they are. No other studio can come close. Nothing can make me feel this way. 

The music, The story , the characters and the fun. It’s just truly ❤️ Magical. ",7eoph7
dq6gu9x,"Saw it earlier tonight and it's gorgeous and surprisingly emotional - Pixar knows how to make me cry evidently. I've been disappointed with more recent Pixar films, but this gets back to their artistic side effectively. Miguel might be my favorite Pixar character. 

I absolutely *loathed* the Frozen 'short' at the beginning. It wasn't Pixar, it was beyond annoying, and it was freaking 20+ minutes long!",7eoph7
dq7v3it,"Absolutely amazing film. I realllllllly don't break for movies often (especially for Pixar movies, which I feel are nearly emotionally manipulative at this point) but I was straight up teary eyed and crying when he sang her fathers song with Coco.

Also - I loved the song/dance climax for the film. Very unique.

And the Frozen short isn't even bad, it was just horribly, horribly misplaced before this movie. So many confused people in my theater. Whoever made that call should be fired. ",7eoph7
dvrzonh,"While this film was pretty formulaic of other pixar films (I want to be something but my family forbid it, like ratatouille) it was well executed and looked beautiful. 

That said the ending hit me like a ton of bricks. I cried, I don't usually cry, it stuck with me and I dwelled on it. And I realised something... 

SPOILER

So the fact that music was banned from the house was a blessing. The guy who stole the song was the biggest star in Mexico (think Elvis, Beatles, MJ standard) - so if Coco had grown up with his music she would have surely have memories of him singing it over her own father as a little girl. 

The fact that she didn't grow up with the pop version meant the intimate personal song her father wrote always stuck with her in that special place which she never forgot. And that was what saved the day. 

I realised this, then I cried again.


",7eoph7
dqrzbiu,"What I loved most was how it showed different perspectives on ""Family first"". Does that mean Miguel should've just gone along with family wishes, or does it mean the other side should let him follow his dream at the expense of facing some hurtful memories, or both?

It shows that family first is well-meaning, but often murky and troublesome when trying to achieve happiness. In the end, they both did something that made each other happy.",7eoph7
dqai2ju,"I took my grandma to see this for Thanksgiving. She really got into it and kept whispering to me when she saw things that mirrored our family. The chancla and tamale jokes especially got her laughing. Probably the most excited I've ever seen her about a movie. 

Also, I saw the ending coming as soon as the twist happened and I actually pre-emptively teared up. Then it happened and with my nana sitting next to me, I was basically a blubbering mess.

This movie better do well so more studios embrace non-pandering diversity. And maybe next time we won't have to sit through a half hour of ""Fucky the Snowman and the Autotune Sisters"".",7eoph7
dr92hgy,"In case the ending seemed a little too ""Disney"" for you... it's actually realistic for those with dementia to regain memory and function through music. I was quickly reminded of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKDXuCE7LeQ) where the same thing happens.",7eoph7
dqc31wr,"As someone who doesn’t have a lot of family left (small family to begin with - lost my sister when I was 18 and my dad a few years ago), this movie hit me right in the feels. It was beautiful, but I still want to tear up thinking about it. Thanks a lot Pixar, making a 35 year old grown man cry like a baby. ",7eoph7
dq9ixth,"What a great movie its definitely in my top 3 pixar films. The colors were great, animation was smooth, characters were likable, and the story was interesting.

My biggest praise would be that they got mexican culture right and Im glad I dragged along my parents to watch the movie. They said they loved it :)",7eoph7
dqbvp8c,I haven't cried in a movie like that in years. I don't want to say it was the greatest animated movies I've ever seen. Just because of recency bias and all. But it's definitely up there. It certainly moved me emotionally. What a great concept. Pixar did it again.,7eoph7
dr1qlb7,"I also loved Hector’s arc throughout the movie, at first you think he is some petty thief trying to get remembered but you realize his tragic story and not being able to have his chance of rectifying his mistake and be with his daughter because of being murdered and that he only wanted Coco to remember he always loved her... Carl Fredicksen territory ",7eoph7
dqnaiaf,"So, thinking my son would think I'm a genius, when they get to the bit where Miguel is singing at Ernesto's party I leaned over and said ""so what do you think is going to happen?""  He said:
 [""he's not Miguel's grandfather""  
So I said ""well, who do you think is?""
 ""Hector""
 ""why is that"" 
""because he has a gold tooth...just like the one on his father's guitar!""  
....which I never for a second noticed...](#spoiler)",7eoph7
dqckgji,"I was blown away by this. It was both kid friendly (I mean I have none but it seemed fine) but shockingly mature. It had character development, a solid twist, and generally shied away from being formulaic and cheesy. I also felt it paid respect to Mexican culture. The “you’re dead forever when forgotten by the living” alone could’ve been the plot to a major non Disney production. It was incredibly emotional. Maybe even more so for me than Toy Story 3. Truly, a return to greatness for Pixar.  Also the music was great. 

ALSO, fuck Olaf. ",7eoph7
dqwd6dq,"I was not expecting this to end up being one of my favorite animated films I've ever seen. But here we are. It exhilarated me like Spirited Away did when I saw that in theaters for the first time. I've been pretty lukewarm or flat out disappointed with most of what pixar has put out since The Incredibles and Wall-E, but they really out did themselves this time. 

It's also the first one to legitimately make me cry. I immediately starting thinking about people I knew who have passed who I may have forgotten about because I just imagined them vanishing into dust. This cartoon had me in this state pondering death, the afterlife, those I've lost, and memories. How my grandfather passed of Alzheimer and how I will never forget that man as long as I live, or how scary it is for me to think about forgetting others. This sounds unpleasant, but it's exhilarating and comforting. 

 It has so many great messages that aren't bludgeoned over the head, but that are genuinely heartfelt and universal. The appreciation of Mexican culture was also pitch perfect, I'm not mexican myself, but in Trump's america this is the type of film we need right now. It's a loving valentine to mexican culture and festivities, but it never comes across as pandering or cheap. It celebrates family in the most fulfilling of ways. Never overly sentimental or coming across obvious like it's shoving it down your throat. It just naturally exudes this amazing warmth. 

I also got a lot of Studio Ghibli vibes. Also, the voice work is outstanding, I loved the songs (which can usually be hit and miss for me in an animated film), and the characters were bursting with life. This all sounds so hyperbolic, I'm just stunned I fell in love with this as much as I have. 

One of Pixar's crowning achievements. 5/5",7eoph7
dq6gtos,"PSA the ""short"" before this movie is a ~25 minute long Frozen storyline that revolves around Olaf the snowman. If you don't want to sit through 25 minutes of Olaf the snowman just show up to the movie around 40 minutes after showtime, I wish I did....

Now about the movie, I really loved it. The characters were funny and lovable, the pueblo residents reminded me of the patients that would come into my clinic(mostly Mexican immigrants), there were lots of tiny details in the movie that made it evident that Pixar really did their research on Mexican culture. I'm happy for (and slightly jealous of) my Mexican/Chicano friends for having such a beautiful movie about their culture! My family is Peruvian so  I'll have to settle for the Emperors new groove :p 

The songs were so fun but after listening to both the English and Spanish soundtracks the Spanish sounds so much better, but both are good! That [on screen death](#spoiler) caught me off guard like woah Disney...The ending made me cry  and I wasn't really expecting the ""surprise"" but perhaps I wasn't paying close enough attention to catch the foreshadowing details. I'm going to have to rewatch it with the Spanish dub for sure! ",7eoph7

dq7ceov,"Pixar does it again! This movie hit so close to home since I'm an absolute Grandma's Boy. Spectacular visuals, that trademark ""tug at your heartstrings"" story telling Pixar is known for, and the music was great. Went to visit my grandma at her house today and hugged the fuck out of her!",7eoph7
dqhtldn,"I’m a huge Pixar fan, or was. Last film I loved from them was WALL-E. I thought UP was okay and didn’t care for inside out. So I’ve been pretty down on them especially with their sequels but I was bored so i gave the film a chance without even seeing a trailer for this one. 

Good lord I loved this film. It felt like the old Pixar but also very unique in the way it was portraying a different culture. I was a bit worried that as an American I wouldn’t appreciate the holiday or customs but I was so elated to see the film being about family at its core and how anyone could appreciate it. My family is extremely important to me but there has always been lots of drama and some of the stuff in here was actually a bit similar to what I’ve experienced. I walked away feeling enlightened. 

The film made me cry, not tear up, cry. There were two times where I was full blown crying at how beautiful or sad(sometimes both) the story was. Sure I can do some nitpicking but when a movie’s story is that good to the point of moving me to tears it did something right in a BIG way. 

This is the first Pixar film that has made me cry, it feels very unique, the world building is fantastic as are the visuals and acting. The whole film feels like a celebration of life and love even though it’s dealing with some pretty dark subject matter in death. No lame or forced jokes. 

I think this movie will not only go down as a Pixar classic, but one of the best thanksgiving films of all time as well. I cannot give it higher praise. ",7eoph7
dr0r17l,"IMO, Pixar at its finest in terms of story beats, mixing the humor with drama, amazing imagery and well thought out characters.

Also, did anyone else see Cantinflas and other popular Mexican celebrities that have passed away? I only caught him, Pedro Infante and Frida Kahlo (the real one, not Hector lol). ",7eoph7
dqghoos,"Coco was an absolutely amazing Pixar movie. At this point I'm only echoing what countless others have said, but I may as well add my voice to all of the positive reviews. 

I don't think the music was especially amazing. There are other movies with catchier songs, but Coco's songs hit me in the feels like no other Pixar movie has. The songs had meaning... they were touching and absolutely sweet.

The color scheme was vibrant and pleasant. The scenes were visually attractive and evoked such happy sentiments. Can we even talk about the neon colors of the spirit animals??? How cool were they?!

The last few minutes of the movie were just so emotionally charged. Way to go, Pixar. My heart just exploded... I couldn't hold the tears in. The emotional intensity was definitely ramped up as the movie neared its end. Nobody was immune. The ending scenes were easy to relate to and empathize with. 

Just... amazing, Pixar. I can't believe there wasn't a tremendous amount of hype for Coco. It deserves a round of applause and a standing ovation.",7eoph7

I was also fortunate enough to get my family together this Christmas Eve to go watch it with me. Everyone was in tears while the credits rolled on.

So many of the themes hit home for me. My grandma is 99 and has dementia and I want to preserve the memories about our family. I don't want our past to be forgotten. Yes, de la Cruz not being Miguel's ancestor was obvious pretty early on but it was a beautiful, heart felt movie.

Most of all, it was personal to me because of what happened to my own abuelita this year and my whole family, who loved her so much, are still a bit torn up about it. So when we went to see it today, almost all of us were crying and it really touched our heart.

Safe to say that broke my heart. 

Also, Abuelita is basically my abuela, strict, forces us to eat a lot, chancla and all. And so sweet whenever it comes to taking care of all of us.

Wow this hit too close to home. Too damn relatable to Miguel. It just got better and better. A perfect story with message alongside beautiful animation.I can't believe this animated movie actually is now my favorite movie of the year. Sorry Three Billboards.

The street animals, the ofrendas, the communal celebration, like all of it. They didn't go book of Life and actually used traditional-ish music too. The visuals were absolutely stunning too.

dr4wf0p,"I loved that as usual they made it very clear in clues early on what was going to happen. We see Miguel coloring in a gold tooth on the guitar, and then later see hector with the gold tooth. And when you see the torn picture before it's folded out you see his belt buckle is of two guitars suggesting a duo.

Yet early on I still had a very different prediction of what was going to happen with the Ernesto reveal. I thought we were going to see an empty shell of a person who was just a depiction of his movie scene so with no personality. Which would somehow reveal to Miguel that Hector was his real father prompting a new mad dash to find him. The idea would be to underline that it wasn't just important to be remembered in the afterlife but also how you were rememebered, and since no one knew Ernesto as anything except his performances that was all he was in the afterworld. Which would also more directly push a family over fame narrative, instead of just a family is important, and fame is important, just don't kill your friends narrative. 

But I guess that's angle is a bit steep for a childrens movie and throwing in a classic villain twist arc was easier for them.",7eoph7

I couldn't believe how sad it was. There were 3 points that brought me to tears.

2. Coco starts to forget her father who meant the world to her. Followed by the flashback of him singing to her to remember him.

3. Miguel singing Remember Me to Coco and she starts to cry. [That part broke me, I'm starting to tear up just thinking about it]

Amazing film, loved every minute of it!",7eoph7
dqb8lzt,"This was a really good movie. If you're a fan of Pixar/Disney then you have no excuse not to see it. The story was both interesting and heart warming, and the twist that leads to the climax was different enough that I didn't fully see it coming. Also the animation is spectacular and really just a thing of beauty. The world they build in this movie, particularly in the land of the dead, is just full of life and color and the few songs that the characters sang/performed were also quite nice. Voice acting is great through out, and the kid was really good too, which is good because kid actors can be hit or miss as the lead IMO, especially in voice acting. 

&nbsp;

Overall, if you have family over and are looking to see a movie this weekend together, you can not go wrong with Coco. Personally I saw practically zero advertising for this movie, I didn't even see a trailer, so I didn't know what to expect besides it being set in Mexico and that it would relate to the Day of the Dead. So I don't know if going in (near) blind made it more enjoyable but I think it's uniqueness and quality make it a good watch regardless of much you know going in. Also, this is the first Pixar movie I've seen since Toy Story 3, and I'd say it hangs up there with the best of them with ease. 

&nbsp;

And it's been mentioned plenty of times here already, but there's a Frozen short at the start which is about 20 minutes long. It's ok, but I think your opinion of it will vary greatly depending on what you think of Frozen and whether or not you know it's coming. I did feel it was a bit on the long side though personally. So while the run time at the theater may be listed as roughly 2 hours, Coco itself is more around an hour and a half. ",7eoph7

The Frozen ""short"" movie at the start was the worst part.

I live with my older brother.  A few days ago he checked into the hospital thinking he had pneumonia.  He actually had a large heart attack.  Had surgery, is in recovery.  I brought one of our closest friends to visit him at the hospital, and once visiting hours were done she and I went out to see *Coco*, so family and mortality were definitely on my mind during that movie.",7eoph7

I couldn’t believe how much it nailed the culture. What a special movie. ",7eoph7
drjyfwu,"The story was formulaic in the sense that you'll likely see where things are going with the plot, but it didn't even matter whatsoever, because the themes, animation and overall adventure of this movie absolutely swept me away. They did an incredible job with this and it's my favourite movie of 2017 so far. Some movies use 'family' or 'loss' as a way to try (and fail) to be endearing to it's audience and it ends up feeling tacky or hollow, but once again Pixar manages to smartly craft and deliver a message across that is just so perfect for both kids and adults.",7eoph7
ds7g5es,"Finally saw this today. The last time I bawled during a movie was Toy Story 3...
And I didn’t bawl because I was reminded of loved ones I’ve lost (though I was), but because I kept thinking about myself. I’m a pretty young adult living with a severe heart condition, which basically means my life expectancy is... who knows. I have ALWAYS had a fear of dying too young and being forgotten, so this movie tore me to shreds emotionally. Remember Me has been stuck in my head all day because of this. 

Other than destroying me on the inside, this was a truly beautiful movie. And I can’t wait for it to come out on DVD so I can watch it over and over. Truly one of Pixar’s best.",7eoph7

Animation and graphics are absolutely amazing, that's kind of a given with Pixar but really impressive.

The musics is on top (especially important considering the big role it plays in the movie), the songs are all great, will certainly listen to the score outside of watching the movie too.

Great story and characters all throughout, very difficult subject for a kids movie but handled with extreme care and respectful of Mexican culture (considering what I heard). And the feels that this movie brings. I'm not ashamed to say I had tears in my eyes quite a few times.

Damn Pixar, that's why you have to create more original movies, they're mostly always at the top of their game while the sequels feels inferior to them.",7eoph7

From what we understand, Mama Imelda never remarried (she didn't seem to have a new beau in the Land of the Dead) and Coco was her only child.

So then Papa Julio is likely Coco's dead husband.

So then who are Tia Rosita, Tia Victoria, Tio Berto, Tio Felipe and Tio Oscar? They would have to be Coco's children (and therefore Abuelita's older brothers and sisters), right? So did Coco survive most of her children? Or could they be Coco's husband's brothers and sisters?",7eoph7

For me it wasn’t quite as good as Inside Out, but definitely on par or better than Toy Story 3. There are definitely things to nitpick like how contrived the coincidences are or the forced climax, but it’s easy to overlook them because you do get sucked into the story, also, the last 10 minutes absolutely destroyed me.

The movie reminded me of Up. There’s a recurring message about loss of family/loved ones. It follows a kid and an old man which have a family like bond. There’s a slow witted but loveable dog sidekick that provides comedic relief. There’s a famous old guy that one of the main character’s idolizes. In the half way point they meet the old guy and he seems super nice and cool, but then it turns out he’s the villain and tries to murder them. The main characters are sad for about but then come to a realization and gets motivated again. And the most gutting wrenching moments are within about 10 minutes of the film, in Up it’s in the beginning and Coco it’s in the end.

The theme of personal ambition versus family tradition is something I think myself and a lot of other who leave their hometowns to pursue creative careers have to face. It's a hard theme to find the right balance for and I think Coco does the best it can have it both ways.

[Hector left his family to become famous, but then decided he wanted to be back with his family right before he was betrayed and murdered by De La Cruz. In the end, Hector gets to be remembered by his family and also famous for the songs he wrote. But if he had been able to leave with his music, those songs probably wouldn't have reached the popular level that De La Cruz made them to be. In the end I guess Hector gets to have it both ways, in that he finds what made him happy in his family and daughter and gets to be remembered by them, but also have his work still be famous because De La Cruz did that leg of the work for him. Not taking anything away from what De La Cruz did (he murdered a guy), but he still elevated Hector's song to what I assume are global popularity.](#spoiler)",7eoph7

Not since Brave have I seen Pixar try something this vivid with a setting before and not since Wall-E have I seen them back it up with a film.

This struck me as a uniquely cynical film by Pixar standards, with every character being greedy or shortsighted in some major way that hurts others. At the same time, however, that cynicism is what made certain moments so hopeful.",7eoph7

dqr5bbn,"I think I'm alone in this but before coco, no pixar movie was as unforgettable as ratatouille. I know right? There was just something about that 10 year old movie about a cooking rat that made you think. Toy story and the first finding nemo are great films. I could find no fault in those but ""up"" was kind of simple (follow your dreams and make friends. Dont be a grouch) and inside out was just too grownup in the execution. My nephews could not understand the ending and i had to explain it slowly. Wall e is good but the lack of dialogue kind of sinks it for me. I could not believe good dinosaur flopped as it was better than ""up"" for me (gasp). So barring toy story 3,  i think coco is the best film since ratatouille in terms of uniqueness, perfect execution, drama and heart.

dunwliv,"(Spoilers Below)

I loved the film a lot more than I expected...I'm Mexican-American and proud of my heritage and I foolishly thought Pixar couldn't nail nearly every aspect of my culture. I was wrong, so very wrong...I don't bawl at movies but I've been known to tear up a little and Miguel and Coco's scene really got me. In hindsight, the twists were predictable but I've learned not to try to figure out things and just enjoy films as there's only so many ways they can go and it's much more fun to allow yourself to be surprised. I do have a tendency to over-analyze and ask questions after and that's why I'm here...I've read just about every comment and most of my comments/questions have been addressed so I'll only mention the few that haven't. 

First, Dante, I saw comments where ppl thought he died and that's not the case IMO...I think the point was animals (spirit guides/alebrijes specifically) have a permanent connection to the land of the dead, even while living...I think they can come and go as they please. This is evidenced by the fact Abuela saw and played with Dante at the end and he and the cat (implied as Pepita) were not ghostly translucent like the other spirits which Dante could obviously still see. This could even imply that they never really die, and possibly reincarnate into a similar (or very different, doesn't really matter) body as if Pepita was known by Imelda in the living world, you can bet she passed, but there at the end, she's right there with Dante. My family just lost our Maltese, Jack, of 11 years, and this is a beautiful thought for me. My Husky/shepherd mix, Dantes (more after Edmund Dantes of the Count of Monte Cristo, but that's inspired by Dante too i believe, actually interesting side note, Dante means Enduring, which is also why it's a great name for Miguel's Dog and the never die theory) is 10 years old and almost 11 so I know he's not far behind and I expect to be fully crushed, but that thought will definitely help.

Second, while I loved the twist with Ernesto and Hector and thought it was very very well done, the musician in me stopped to wonder why would he do that really? I'm not worried about how or the logistics, but what would he have to gain. You see, if he and Hector had been playing together for a while or even a year, he knows the songs through and through. Perhaps not 'Remember Me' which was admittedly his greatest hit as Hector probably never showed it to him wanting to keep it for his daughter, but he wouldn't have known that existed, and murdering for one song seems silly. The rest should've been in his repertoire already. Lastly, ending Hector only served the temporary. The better move would have been to pay Hector for the rights to his songs (upfront and royalties) so he could continue to churn hit after hit for him. Hector gets to stay home and provide for his family and Ernesto gets the fame and majority of the fortune to himself, cuz let's be honest, rarely do fans gush over the songwriters in the background. I suppose he did get famous from those few songs and it worked out for him at first but it just seemed like a very foolish and short sighted thing for him to do. Had he not been crushed by that bell, he would have been crushed by the eventual washed up-ness that would have followed had he not been able to come up with any good new material.

Third, While I loved the Spanish version for the more natural feeling dialogue, as a singer/songwriter myself that is all about emotive delivery of the lyrics in music, I couldn't help but feel the Spanish versioned actors were too smooth in their singing. Beautiful yes, but the English actors actually acted and expressed emotions during their songs. Miguel sounded more amateurish in English than in Spanish and Ernesto didn't seem as pompous and cocky in Spanish, prob because the Spanish actors are actual musical artists but they just seemed to lay down perfect studio tracks. For the most part, it was still ok, but Miguel and Coco's Scene at the end really highlighted the difference. In English, Anthony starts off practically crying and singing and becomes more joyful...Luis just sings it beautifully from the start. Takes away a little something for me. I prefer the English version though it is probably the best Spanish dubbed movie I've ever seen, without a doubt. When speaking, it felt very fluid and not out of place like other dubbed films. And Gael was awesome in both versions. He's so Good!

Lastly, though my immediate family is from a little pueblo in Guadalajara Mexico, they/we never grew up with Day of the Dead traditions. I wondered if we did and I never knew about it since we never visited at that time, but after asking my parents, no, they didn't so all of this is relatively new to me. Having read through the comments, I was disappointed to learn there is no actual Land of the Dead where the remembered reside and can be forgotten and what not. So I wonder, where did this idea originate? I only ask because Book of Life also had a similar concept with the Lands of the Remembered and the Forgotten. I'm not comparing the two, they're very different and I enjoyed that one as well, though not as much as Coco which has reached Inside Out level for me due to the cultural aspect. Inside Out still slightly edges it out slightly for me due to it being a bonafide masterpiece, but it's definitely up there. I just wonder if there's something out there, even in a different culture that inspired these concepts. At any rate, real or not, I love the idea of setting that day aside to remember your loved ones and I plan to build an ofrenda this coming year and maybe get some sugar skulls and alebrijes. Why not!?",7eoph7

dqcd99i,"Wow... I just got out of my showing and I'm still collecting my thoughts. Pixar does it again, and made the best animated movie of the year! (not that they had much competition).

This is my personal favorite movie of the year so far. It was absolutely incredible. Everything from the details that Pixar puts in all their movies, to the story, to the music, to pretty much anything. All of it was done so well.

This was a solid 10/10 for me, and a movie I plan to see again with another group. Wow. ",7eoph7
dqcstjo,"After the movie, my younger cousins were surprised that I was crying. I was the opposite of Miguel growing up. My late maternal grandparents were musicians and they introduced me to arts/music. They brought me to recitals and musical programs.

[I was really surprised that the guitar wasn't more of the film. Like I thought the trailers implied he would have magical powers or something from playing it.

dqfcuv9,"Loved it, like everybody else here. Went home and listened to the soundtrack on Spotify. I think my favorite scene as I look back was when Hector goes to his old friend who's about to fade away and sings him that little song about Juanita. Pixar does a great job in their best movies of including little rest scenes in the middle of the mayhem to allow you to stop and think.

My one complaint would be that the scene where [Ernesto gets his comeuppance felt like one too many. Miguel could have gone back on the second-to-last ""blessing"" scene, leaving Ernesto's fate clearly implied, and it would have been fine](#spoiler). Not everything has to be spelled out.",7eoph7

dq7db4w,"Overall, I really liked the movie. The music was awesome (Robert and Kristen Lopez have been on fire since Avenue Q). However, I have questions. 


Why do some of the dead have jobs? 

What's the economic situation in TLotD? 

Do the customs workers ever get to visit their families? Maybe you say they don't have families. Well why don't they disappear?

If you only disappear when you're no longer remembered, why didn't the guy in the hammock survive? Miguel says he remembers him, but Hector says it doesn't work that way. How does he know? Miguel's the first living person to visit TLotD. 

How are spirit animals decided? Why does his GGGrandma get a sick ass flying cat and Miguel get a retarded dog? And why don't his other family members have any?

Where's Coco's husband?

The emotional resonance of this film is up there with Inside Out and the first 10 minutes of Up.

drgzhpp,I could have misheard.  But at De La Cruz's party when the videos of his movie roles and what not were playing on the walls. I could've sworn that De La Cruz was riding a horse that he called Dante in one of them.  Is this at all related to the fact that Dante the dog was a spirit animal? Was Dante related to Hector in any way and this was yet another thing De La Cruz stole from him?  It seemed that all along Dante was trying to bring Miguel back to Hector.  Maybe Dante was Hector's dog in life?  Could be a stretch.,7eoph7

dqdvgcy,"This was honestly one of the most aesthetically beautiful movies I ever seen. Many will liken it to ""The Book of Life"" which was incredible but I enjoyed Coco more (they both obviously share a beautiful holiday). From an animation perspective, this is one of Pixar's best animated movie (if not the best). The colors are so vibrant they pop off the screen and the scenes are ridiculously detailed.  Some of the scenes look photorealistic if the characters are taken out of the shots. From a plot/dialogue perspective - I think it was overall really good. All the actors can sing which was great but no one song or moment really stuck out to me. Frozen raised the bar to another level but its not a fair comparison because nobody can match Idina Menzel's powerful voice. Speaking of Frozen - that fucking short was damn annoying. [I thought it was a freakin trailer when it started and was going to end at one point but kept going. WAY TOO LONG! A kid in my theater exasperated ""finally!"" when the short ended.

Also they do bring up the point that Dante is a spirit guide but they also say maybe he wasn’t at first. Maybe he earned it fully by watching over Miguel in the spirit world? 

Maybe that’s far fetched but if true thats an amazing little detail. And doesn’t Pixar love amazing little details?

 Even if it’s not the case it still provides context for how Miguel is rationalizing the dog being with him. Like how he never wonders how Dante is there with him. ",7eoph7

Everything was set for disapointment.
Bad trailer, bad marketing in my country, and a visual universe that i dont usually like.

As deep as the questionning of faith and familly in inside out.
Crafter with the same perfectionnisme as Stanley Kubrick (if i remember correctly the negative spaces between buildings when he discover the city of the deads were shaped as skullhead to avoid the juxtaposition of the fireworks with the buildings.

Or the use of color palete from mexican culture, who is a whole new level of storytelling by itself.

To finish the finest exemple of universal concepts in movies.
Most of the animated movies use [The Hero with a Thousand Faces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces) as a bible, in order to connect with the audience.

dq9ceia,"I always look forward to seeing what short Pixar puts before their films... imagine my surprise!

It's not that the Frozen thing was BAD, it was just clearly, clearly, a TV or direct to video special and entirely too long.

To fix it, all they needed to do was start with the bell sequence, how Anna and Elsa had no tradition, then the bit with Olaf setting everything on fire and telling the reindeer they're in trouble.

That would have been fine as a short

Coco though was f'ing brilliant. Best Pixar flick in a while. Needs to be a double feature with Kubo and the Two Strings.",7eoph7

dqm3s8t,"I loved this movie! My wife is Hispanic so I have come to learn various parts of the culture and language, and seeing those things in this movie made it every bit more amazing! Before this, Book of Life was the closest thing to filling that niche. Nothing against Guillermo del Toro, but seeing Coco makes me realize how much was lacking from Book of Life. Coco really embraces it all from the Spanish/Spanglish being more present, to aspects from the culture like the Alebrijes, to abuelita's threats of taking her chancla to the mariachi. Even the casting was better. Channing Tatum is an excellent actor, but not my first pick for a movie taking place in Mexico.",7eoph7
dqnay3g,"I saw this because there was nothing else showing I wanted to see. I also make an effort to see a movie at the theater once a week, so this sets up my interest, or lack of, going into the theater.  
  
First: VERY glad that stupid 22 minute Frozen short is leaving the beginning. It was at the beginning of my showing and dragged on and on. Unwelcome, not even good, and felt like a 22 minute advertisement.  
  
That said, Coco had a lot of heart. There were some great twists and great music throughout the movie. Culturally, not everything hit for me since I've never been part of the Mexican culture. They do a lot to help you along the way and don't just assume you know the culture, so that was good. The characters had their own personalities and quirks. They felt like a real family.

The premise seemed very simple but the delivery was on point and didn't feel cliched. Music was gorgeous and ""Remember Me"" is catchy but not annoyingly catchy like ""Let It Go."" Speaking of Frozen, that short was really long. All in all, I really liked the movie would probably watch it again in the future.",7eoph7
dq8u0pj,"Being of Mexican descent and having my Mom pass away recently, I had a special connection with the film. Masterful from beginning to end. The end had me bawling like a baby. Really enjoyed the progression and pace of Miguel's journey to reach De La Cruz and discover the truth about his family. Pixar has once again produced a memorable and timeless masterpiece for many generations to come.

Edit: The Frozen ""short"" was way too long. Could have easily been a 5 or 10 minute thing. Bit of a weird decision to include it. Skip it, it's almost 30 minutes long.",7eoph7
dqn3va0,"This movie just kept shattering the cynicism and criticisms I was thinking during it.

""de la Cruz is his great great grandfather; it's obvious, please don't drag this reveal out!""

""I don't get why they're so desperate to go to the Land of the Living, it's not established well.""

""This Hector character is really annoying.""

dqghmqh,"I really liked this movie. In fact, it was one of my favorite Pixar film in years. Everything I loved about it has already been said here. I will say, the one thing that felt a little wonky for me was the relationship between the great grandfather and great grandmother. Dealing with the dynamics of a father abandoning his family to be an artist is a pretty big deal, and I feel like they weren't able to give that part of the plot as much attention as it deserved. Yeah, we find out that Hector was going to go back home, but I wish the great-grandmother didn't seem quite so shrill considering what her husband did was very wrong (seriously, he walked away from his daughter). Again, I loved the movie, but I wish the 20 minutes of Frozen was instead used to add more to what was an awesome movie.",7eoph7

Edit: So I was searching older posts for the promos for Coco and chanced upon [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/70v1ny/disneypixars_coco_new_poster/). It was getting shit on so hard, glad that it proved itself otherwise.",7eoph7

dqvy631,"I've seen this movie 3 times (going a 4th on Saturday) and am still unable to sit through it without crying. As a musician, as someone who lost a grandfather recently, and as a movie fan, it completely tore me in two. This is probably my favorite Pixar movie to date. 

The songs were well-crafted and not a story crutch, as is so often the case with kids' movies. The plot was almost too beautiful for words (the one thing I would change would be to SPOILER [make the buildup to when we're supposed to think that de la Cruz is his grandfather more of an emotional payoff so that when we find out he's not, it's even more surprising](#spoiler)

The only thing is I was actually sadder after the movie was over due to the fact that I believe that Miguel wasn’t sure if he arrived on time for Coco to remember Hector or not so Miguel is going to go his whole life not knowing if him singing to his great grandma worked or not :(,7eoph7

The Frozen short however just seemed like cheap advertising for a second movie and nothing else. Way too long and not nearly as good as Lou or Lava. Definitely didn't enjoy it, but thankfully Coco more than made up for it.",7eoph7

Miguel was a good character during all the movie, I liked the idea of putting wakeup on him during practically all the movie.  

I'm glad because it was completely different of The Good Dinosaur or Dory. Pixar is really great when it comes to make original movies.

I have one issue with the story though. I think I just didn't understand it well or read between the lines. [How did Miguel enter the spirit world just by touching the guitar?

dqc91xo,"What an amazing film!!!!!  I loved every minute of the movie (except that Frozen ""short"").  I love the movie more because I am also Mexican and the culture was represented well, but I also loved the movie because of how well the story was told. If the movie can make a 38 year old man cry, then you know the movie did something right. ",7eoph7
dqr8zsx,"This one was a little too predictable from a very early point. I still loved the first half of Coco (the first half is some of my favorite Pixar content ever) but before he got to de la Cruz I was just counting the seconds until they revealed he wasn't the actual great great grandfather, and how he was actually villainous or at the very least a self-absorbed douchebag who would refuse to help. 

I once described Pixar films' greatest strength as being the ability to appeal to audiences of all ages equally. Coco does that fine, but I really want to see them telling more stories without traditional hero vs villain structures. More Inside Out, less Cars 3. Maybe that's an unfair request.

Visually, I loved the movie. They've never made a movie that had an environment that looked anything like this before. The world of the dead was just so pleasing to look at, and even Miguel's town in the living world was visually very distinct from all of their past stuff.  I won't compare the art direction to their past films, but in terms of the finished product, I really liked looking at it. 

Overall, Coco is probably my favorite Pixar movie since Wall-E. Not a high bar unless you really love the Toy Story 2 remake they made in 2010, but still. Even with all the complaints I had, it impressed me. The voices, the visuals, the music, it was all good. At no point was I close to crying, though. The movie was more heartwarming than sad or bittersweet, imo. ",7eoph7
dq81fci,"Geez, that Frozen movie lasted forever.",7eoph7
dqc7qps,"Absolutely beautiful movie.  As much as I loved the origins of ""Remember Me"" (and boy was I tearing) the end song was what really got me.  Seeing all the old generations happy and singing with the new generation was really emotional for me.

And the Frozen short wasn't THAT bad. Maybe having 5 or 6 songs was a little much, but I had fun. There was one family who almost left because they thought they were in the wrong movie and the audience had to explain to him that it was a short before  the movie. I thought that was funny haha  Ultimately it's length is the biggest offender as we were all there to see Coco obviously but the short itself was kind of cute in my opinion.

EDIT:  I had one small bit of confusion that I don't knock the movie for as it was likely entirely my misunderstanding.  So the beginning has Miguel recounting how his family is cursed because his father left to pursue his love for music.  Very soon after that, we are introduced to De La Cruz.  My mind automatically assumed that the movie was telling us that that was his father.  I thought a bit part of the conflict was that his father was the greatest musician ever and yet his family had forbade music for generations.  When he uncovers the rest of the photo and sees the guitar, it's treated like a plot twist.  I was confused because I thought that was established at the very beginning!   I was very much, ""ok...?  Didn't we already know this?""  Did anybody else get tripped up with this?

Of course, if you've seen the movie, that twist is actually re-twisted later! ",7eoph7
dqci3nh,"Absolutely gorgeous. It went HARD too, I was so shocked near the end. Hector was adorable, so was Coco. ""de la Cruzito"", oh my god",7eoph7
dqju4ke,"Great movie, I didn't research anything about it prior to going in so I felt pleasantly surprised by the way it turned out.  I have not enjoyed many of Pixar's latest films, especially their sequels, so I'm glad they have come out with something I like again.

What I didn't like though was that awful Frozen short in the beginning.  It wouldn't have been a major problem had the short actually been short, but it was about 20 minutes long, pretty much an entire animated episode.  The other problem was that it wasn't even that interesting of a short.  I understand it was included because it dealt with holiday traditions much like Coco but the way they deal with it in the short is just so uninteresting.  Even children near me were confused and not amused by the short.

As for the movie itself visually there were moments that were absolutely spectacular.  Pretty much all the background shots were amazing, especially the one's of the city in the land of the dead.  If you are looking for a reason to watch this in theaters as opposed to at home, this would be it.  The amount of detail you can see on the big screen is insane and I think would be lost if viewed on just a laptop.  As for the plot of the movie, it was a lot darker than I expected.  [for example I didn't expect so much death in this movie.  Right when the great grandmother was introduced I knew damn well she'd die cause she was so fucking old and the movie was named after her, but I did not expect so many other characters to have such sad deaths, especially Hector who was freaking murdered.](#spoiler)

To put into perspective the darkness of this film, at the end of it, the child sitting next to me who was probably about 7 years old was crying non stop.  Not happy tears crying, like devastated, depressed sort of crying.  Throughout the film I could over hear her whispering to her mom asking questions about certain character deaths and her exclaiming ""are they dead?""  Compared to other disney/pixar movies, I feel this movie may be for a bit of an older audience (say middle school).  For that little kid I really feel like all the death in this movie was rather traumatizing for her.

Overall a great film, I don't recall feeling bored during it despite the long run time, it managed to provide with a couple twists I didn't expect and some great visuals.",7eoph7

dqqjd9z,"So today's my birthday, and because I was curious, I decided to go see *Coco*.

Needless to say, I have a lot to say about this film. 

- **Point 1: ""Book of Life"" vs. ""Coco"": Or, Why They're Both Equally Good Movies**

First off, I want to get the comparisons about *Book of Life* and *Coco* out of the way. I've been a long-time supporter of *Book of Life* creator Jorge Gutierrez, especially given his massive struggles just to get *Book of Life* made, and to get mainstream Hollywood to recognize (and respect) Mexican culture in films.

Comparing *Book of Life* ad *Coco* is like comparing apples to oranges. Yes, they have similar themes, and yes, they have similar plot / story and character elements. However, seeing both movies, it's clear that there are some *major* differences between them as well.

I see people are also being completely unfair to *Book of Life* on this thread for no reason, and I'll list why:

- *Coco* had a 3-4x bigger budget than *Book of Life* did - including advertising, production, etc. ($50 million for *Book of Life* vs. $175-200 million for *Coco*)
- *Coco* was made by a much bigger, older, well-established, and well-funded studio than *Book of Life*. (Disney-Pixar vs. Reel FX)
- *Coco* was subject to ""the Pixar formula"", which viewers are far more familiar with, as well as being made by a well-beloved studio that most American viewers are more familiar with.

That being said, of course, from the start, due to its advantages, *Coco* was probably going to be more widely considered ""the better film"" - and have better ratings, because most critics love Pixar. The studio has been a cornerstone in innovative animation for the past 20-odd-years, and is a major part of most Milennials' childhoods. When you take into account that, to date, *Coco* appears to be Pixar's last ""original"" (i.e. non-sequel) film at the moment - possibly signifying ""the end of the Pixar golden era"" - this is even more so. 

Popular misconceptions I've seen:

- **""Book of Life"" doesn't have as much culture as ""Coco"".** People who say this obviously do not remember *Book of Life* well, or simply didn't pay attention. Both films did a phenomenal job at providing attention to detail in terms of Mexican culture. They both draw from the same sources in terms of character and scene design - including Day of the Dead motifs. *Book of Life* also focuses more on Mexican / Aztec mythology, romantic love, and the ""hero's quest"", whereas *Coco* focuses more on the theme of family, platonic love, and ""unravelling the mystery"". Many people forget that *Book of Life* takes place in 19th century Mexico, whereas *Coco* takes place in modern-day Mexico - therefore, of *course* Mexican culture would be different in those time periods.

- **""Coco"" ripped off ""Book of Life"".** Not true. After seeing *Coco*, one can say, definitively, that the two are *starkly* different - and, even if Disney-Pixar decided to use the same concept, they completely tweaked and re-wrote it. *Coco* is also, very clearly, written to fit the ""Pixar Formula"" - and, I feel, is based largely on previous Pixar films like *Ratatouille* (i.e. re-using the scene where Remy watches Chef Gusteau say ""everyone can cook"" for Miguel watching Ernesto de la Cruz talk about ""following his dream"") - whereas *Book of Life* draws much more from the classical fairy-tale format. 

- **""Coco"" had better writing than ""Book of Life"".** Personally, I didn't find *Coco* any better than *Book of Life* in terms of writing. Both had similar surface details, but again, both had different messages that they were trying to convey. A lot of people - and I mean a *lot* - are also forgetting that *Coco* uses some of the *same* writing / plot devices that *Book of Life* used! One major example was narration / exposition given to ""set the scene"" at the beginning of the movie - something which I found that people somehow praise Pixar for, but criticize *Book of Life* for the same thing.

- **""Coco"" had better design than ""Book of Life"".** When it comes down to it, both movies had *phenomenal* character design, and paid attention to little details. Many people also do not give nearly enough credit, or even brush off, Reel FX doing such amazing animation on *Book of Life*...for only a quarter of the funding that Pixar had for *Coco*. However, I will give *Coco* credit for putting an absolutely *insane* amount of detail in their ""City of the Dead"" as well. This was, very likely, a result of *Coco*'s budget being 3-4x that of *Book of Life*'s. *Book of Life*, unfortunately, didn't spend much time in their ""City of the Dead"", most likely because (unlike Disney-Pixar) they simply couldn't afford it.

- **That people feel the need to put ""Book of Life vs. Coco"" against one another at all.** Seriously. Everyone was aware, from the start, that *Coco*, which was made by Pixar, would gain a much wider popularity and audience than *Book of Life*. It's like trying to pit the underdog trying to get into the industry (Reel FX) against a juggernaut of wealth, fame, and success (Disney-Pixar)...or, for you *Coco* fans, the obvious comparison of [Hector Rivera vs. Ernesto de la Cruz, according to some BOL fans](#spoiler). That being said, both the creator of *Book of Life*, Jorge Gutierrez, and the director of *Coco*, Lee Unkrich...are, actually, good friends in real life. Gutierrez has been nothing but supportive of *Coco* on his Twitter.

Now that's out of the way, on to my feelings about *Coco*, as a stand-alone film. 

- **Point 2: Why I Both Loved (and Hated) ""Coco"" - From Both Personal and Professional Views**

Firstly, from a personal viewpoint...*Coco* completely destroyed my emotions, but only because the story...was something *I*, too, had experienced. [Particularly, with the core tale of *Coco* being the love story of Hector and Imelda.](#spoiler) 

[Hector reminded me so much of my ex, who was also Hispanic, and loved to write music, poetry, create stories, play guitar, and learn instruments. Like Imelda and Hector, for a long time, my ex and I shared a really close, loving bond. We both loved to express ourselves through the language of song and language, though unlike Imelda, I...lost my singing voice before I met him. We even talked about building a future together at one point - possibly getting married and having kids. He promised me that he would always love me, always be there for me. But then...he seemed to ""disappear"" - not physically, but mentally and emotionally, out of the blue. So, I had to make my own way, without him.](#spoiler)

So, of course, given this, by the end of the film, I was absolutely on the verge of sobbing like a baby during the film...or locking myself in the nearest broom closet and drowning in sorrows. If Pixar has a knack for making people cry, then watching *Coco* was like having Pixar constantly gut-punch me in the feels, over and over again.

That being said, from a professional standpoint, I'll lists both positives and ""areas of improvement"" with this film:

**Pros**

- It's absolutely one of Pixar's best films, and is a fitting tribute to Pixar's first films, including *Toy Story* (of which there are Easter Eggs of in the film), *A Bug's Life*, and others. I liked it even better than *Inside Out*, and it's on the level of *Up!* and *WALL-E*.
- It's *Ratatouille* if you mixed it with *Up!*, with a Mexican theme and backdrop. However, I felt it *improved* upon the themes originally introduced in *Ratatouille*.
- It has simply stunning details and attention in every scene, particularly in the ""City / Land of the Dead"", and, by far, I feel, the most of *any* Pixar movie to-date.
- It touches upon the theme of ""family"" and platonic love that are at the heart of Day of the Dead - even including references to the holiday's ancient Aztec and Mayan (Mesoamerican) roots by including Mayan temples, ""guardian spirits"", etc. - with perfect ease. 
- Despite some very mature themes, I feel that the protagonist, Miguel, is one of Pixar's most likeable and relatable protagonists, and the story written of his journey - and *bildungsroman*, or ""coming of age"" - is particularly well-done. 

**Cons**

- The writing, I feel, could've been improved in some areas - and it shows. It felt like areas of the plot were rushed, predictable (I saw many ""twists"" coming from a mile away). Like the criticism with *Book of Life* with using over-handed exposition via to try and get people into the film, I also had that issue with *Coco*. There's one, golden rule taught to writers - ""show, don't tell"" - and Pixar broke that rule, sometimes at several points in the film. There was too much ""telling"" and not enough ""showing"". I also felt there was some major plot contrivance and breaking of suspension of disbelief.
- Lack of explanation, or even tweaking, of certain aspects of Mexican culture and lore, particularly of the *Alebrijes* (and not featuring their creator, Pedro Linares, as a skeleton in the Land of the Dead). It seems to me like they cut out an entire sub-plot about the creatures, and left zero explanation about how they work. In the film, they're stated to be ""guardians of the dead"", implying that they've always been present, when in reality, they have zero ties to Day of the Dead. However, they didn't appear before the 1930s in Mexico, and are largely the creation of one artist, who claimed to get the concept from a hallucinogenic-like dream.
- Editing out of the religious roots and links of Day of the Dead in order to make it more ""Disney friendly"". What many people don't realize is that Day of the Dead is, to a large extent, *absolutely* a religious holiday - not only closely tied with Catholicism, but also the original Aztec and Mesoamerican religion(s). Instead of religion, Disney-Pixar focused on the *Alebrijes* (which, again, otherwise had no link to the Day of the Dead) as ""guardians of the dead"" in a ham-fisted approach to try and avoid the religious nature of the holiday.

dr7c1ct,"Missed opportunity. Don't want to bury the lead. I LOVED the movie, every bit of it, but as I discussed it with my friend afterward it really hit me how big of a missed opportunity the character of de la Cruz was. In a world where there are split up families everywhere Pixar had a golden opportunity to give a nuanced view of how to deal with black sheep. Until the Hector twist at the end I thought for sure they were going to have to let de la Cruz explain how he could justify doing such a hurtful thing like walk away from his family and then more importantly show us how the family could come to peace with the consequences of that choice. But then Pixar just turned de la Cruz into a monster who everyone could just forget about him because he wasn't part of the family after all. Like I said it was a terrific movie, I just think it was a missed opportunity to show how find love inside a real flawed family. ",7eoph7

He also finds out Ernesto is a murderer, and a plagiarist. What will he do? Follow his dreams, even when their family is against that and his main inspiration is a lie? Abandon his dreams? NO!

I was pleased with it. All I knew it that it was Pixar, and it did deliver on a Pixar level quality. It is no Wall-E or Monster’s Inc, but it is really good in Pixar standards, great by animated movie standards.

The music was great, the animation was incredible as always, and this time the cinematography was better done than usual IMO. The depth of field shots were much more real camera like, and some of the environments and skin animation looked photographic. 

The story wasn’t totally unpredictable, but I did feel it steered away from cliches a good bit and actually had quite a bit of layers and depth to it that I appreciated. At first it felt like a kids movie, like Frozen or something (probably because of that cheesy Frozen short that made me feel like 5 years old before the movie?), but then it got deeper and felt more like Up with all the emotions and serious tones. 

It’s worth seeing in theaters. I appreciate that it might not be the best Pixar movie, but they always meet or exceed my expectation of a great movie every time. ",7eoph7

Is one of the uncles wearing a National Soccer team jersey in the US screenings? When I saw it one of them was using the Mexico jersey (the three bars in the sleeve left little doubt), whilst in the posters he had a generic purple shirt.

Disney has a history of changing small details depending on the screening region. Let's take Inside Out for example. Baby Riley had broccoli in North America but the japan version showed a different kind of food (can't recall which). Additionally, in the scene where [the dad's mind drifts off](#spoiler) the Mexico version showed a soccer match instead of hockey like in the USA. I'm assuming the jersey is one of those changes, which would add to that list of attention to detail Pixar is known for. Like other users have replied already, every Mexican family has that relative who wears soccer jerseys and it's a typical inside joke in the Mexican culture.

dq9n2p4,"I was moved by this film. Coco tells the story of a young musician, Miguel (*Anthony Gonzalez*), who desires to reconnect his family to its musical roots. To do so, he ends up in the world of the dead in search of his lost great-great grandfather. Most of the film's story is highly predictable but the scenery will engross the viewer into each scene. Colors are abound in the film. From Miguel's town to the city of the dead, each world is vivid (*no pun intended*) with the appropriate contrast. Coco's tale is an emotional one, and the film would have even the toughest person in the theater shedding tears at the end. The film encompasses both Miguel's living and decease families but focuses more on the latter, especially Miguel's great-great grandmother. There is a scene concerning her that stops the entire movie and makes the viewer respond with a ""huh."" 

Everything about the film's directing, voice-acting (*I would really like to watch this movie in Spanish*), animation, and editing are great. Though the run time is under 2 hours, there is a lot of content that provides one's money worth.

This seems like a common enough occurrence for an afterlife to be much more well documented by the living.

It didn't hurt my enjoyment of the movie any (which was pure Bliss) but just a thought.

Actually, you know what, more questions:

What if the skeletons stay in the living world after sunrise?

Do the spirit guides always exist and help the people or do we create them?  I forgot what their actual name was so I just started calling them stands like in JoJo's bizzare adventures

What if you die in the spirit world?

Did I hear right that it isn't enough remembering somebody for them not to fade because they have to be family?  If so, explain why Ernesto didn't go poof.  He's just as much a deadbeat as Miguel was famous or not, I doubt his next of kin would recognize him as family.

Finally, if we're going to get a sequel (a.k.a Pixar hasn't gotten the memo that they've made more Cars 2s than Toy Story 3s), this isn't so much a question as it is a request but please make the sequel focus around La Llrona and finding her lost children.

They could have done one of two things here. Either make the twist a double whammy, where we find out with one blow that Ernesto murdered Hector AND Hector is really Miguel's GGGP, or you skip the second twist completely, which would vindicate the Abuela's hatred of Ernesto and also add in a neat little theme of 'family isn't just the people you're related to', though I don't know how that would have gone over in Mexico.

dq9l952,"Toy Story 3 is my favorite Pixar film so I was excited to see Lee Ukrich in the director's chair again. And he certainly delivered, along with his co-director Adrian Molina. I was able to predict much of the film from the start thanks to all the foreshadowing. The fact that Hector was Miguel's father, Ernesto being shady in some way, that Remember Me was written for the Rivera family, and that Coco would be key to the climax of the film. 

Despite predicting all that though the way the film executed is what made the difference. I feel like the scene with Chicharrón passing isn't getting talked about as much since there were so many great emotional scenes later on. But that was the first truly great scene in the film and not one I predicted at all. 

I'm a sucker for elderly people getting emotional so Hector singing ""Remember Me"" and the scene with Coco at the very end both made me tear up. Loved the strong focus on the importance of family and keeping people in your memories. I was worried at first they had made a plot hole with Hector being around despite Coco's death but then I remembered that the stories from those who knew the person while alive are what keeps them around. And thanks to Hector becoming famous he'll be remembered for a long time, not to mention being reintegrated with the family. 

I only had two critiques aside from the plot being somewhat predictable:

1. I would've preferred it if Imelda had been more unforgiving of Hector after he returned. She pretty quickly began calling him ""the love of my life"" again despite the fact that he ran out on her and she had rejected music so fully. I think they could've toned that down during the third act and showed them acting closer when they were all together a year later, reunited with Coco.

2. I understand that this needed to happen in order to set up the whole story but I'm not sure I buy Coco continuing her mother's ""no music"" policy after Imelda died. For a while Coco had to have been the matriarch of the family and she clearly loved her father and his music. Now it's possible she went through a phase in the middle years of her life where she was mad at him and shut that all away, all the regrets coming back only as she got old. But if that's the case I feel like that should've been shown in the film or at least referenced.

These two critiques are pretty minor in the wider scheme of things. Pixar blew me away again with this film and I'm glad to see them back on top.

It kind of made me wonder...how did figure that out? If Hector and Ernesto played together, how would they be able to figure out authorship? Questioned documents unit? Seeing the guitar on the picture?  Fumigating his body? Or just was like ""ask someone from the land of the dead""
The letters don't necessarily prove that Hector wrote the songs. They could have easily said that Hector stole from Ernesto. 
So that kinda made me say ""huh?"" while in the movie theater.

\**SPOILERS*\*

""okay, the formula dictates he needs a goofy sidekick.  how about a dog?  okay, he needs a quirk.  a long unwieldy tongue?  bingo!""  ugh.  and i was actually screaming at my screen at the end as the sun was rising and they were trying to build emotion and tension.  ""JUST TAKE THE BLESSING AND SING THE SONG TO COCO!!""  but we had to suffer 10 minutes of pointless clumsy emotional filler before getting to the resolution we all knew was coming.  consequently i was just too annoyed to get any satisfaction from the grand finale.

I still love the movie and its messages.

But I also thought the movie was very PIXAR redundant.  2 characters on a buddy trip from Point A to Point B.  Ex. Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Inside Out, The Good Dinosaur, Up, and Monsters Inc. more or less.  And there's also the sour, downer point at the end of second act where the 2 characters are stuck in an isolated place.  A la, Toy Story, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, WALL-E, and Inside Out.

I saw Moana last year on Thanksgiving and thought that was pretty good--not great. This is pretty average. 

-  Holy shit, that Olaf short story was mind mindbogglingly boring. I couldn't wait for it to end. The only redeeming thing was seeing the Frozen sisters again.
- The main character was really generic. Had a hard time caring about him because I've seen his character a thousand times already.
- Everybody else was good though.
- I can't help but feel the movie's story too much was based on misunderstanding and not knowing. I wondered why the great, great grandma never mentioned or made peace with the grandfather. I'm sure it technically makes sense but it makes the story feel contrived.
- The world of the afterlife was amazing to look at. It felt like a really comfy video game setting. 
- As usual in Disney/Pixar films, I dislike animal sidekicks. 
- The twist was a little too obvious.
- I think Pixar is moving too much into the hyperrealistic look sometimes. It's great for water or environment but for character it was a bit much. Sometimes the main character's face looked like an alien.
- Overall, I liked it enough, but it was only just ""okay.""

EDIT Seems like I criticized a sacred cow. And hardly any counterpoints, just passive aggressive down votes. Pixar themselves have talked about the 22 rules of storytelling and yet Coco feels oddly unoriginal. The more I think about Coco, the less interesting it becomes. It doesn't stay with me like Blade Runner 2049.

dq6hb6b,"That Frozen short was definitely a slog. Had it premiered as a half hour special on television between A Charlie Brown Christmas and The Grinch, it'd be perfectly wonderful holiday kiddie fodder. But watching it as an adult on the big screen feels like a chore. The plot is thin and the music is forgettable.

As for Coco, I definitely enjoyed it. Judging it is tricky, though. Had this been a Dreamworks, Illumination or Sony animated film, I would've walked out of this thing shouting ""Amazing! Remarkable! Wonderful! Must-See!"" But since it's Pixar, I feel compelled to compare it to other Pixar movies and in that sense, it sorta falls a little short. I'd say it definitely hovers in the middle of the pack; better than, say, the Cars movies, A Bug's Life and The Good Dinosaur, but it's no Toy Story, Wall-E or Inside Out. 

Much like Brave, this feels a bit more like a Disney fairy tale than a Pixar movie, although I found this to be more effective than Brave. The ""surprise"" twist is telegraphed pretty early on, but it still works.

I would recommend skipping the 3D screenings, as I felt it didn't add much of anything. The Land of the Dead, which looks like it has so much depth in the trailers looks surprisingly flat with the glasses. The 3D throughout is lackluster. I found myself more impressed with the 3D in the trailer for Sherlock Gnomes (which still looks like it's going to be a hot garbage movie).

The ending bothers me a bit.  While it's sweet Miguel sang to Coco, why? One doesn't need to be remembered by family or even someone who knew you when you were alive, so why didn't Miguel count? 

Hector's murder was never actually uncovered and he never got real justice in the history or music books.

I also felt most of his family was pretty useless to the story.  Undead background characters got more personality to them.

Lastly, while again I stressed it was sweet that Miguel sang to Coco, the movie goes against the Disney grain. Abuela isn't called out by anyone for how she acts (she'd be a villain in most other movies) and there seemed to be an undertone against feeling non-relatives as family members (many neighbors were friendly,but no one was close to Miguel and helped encourage his talent like in most other Disney movies).

One of the things that did surprise me was how they chose to reveal Hector was the father of coco...WHAT?!? The whole movie they were building for the guitar to create that reveal. Something like Hector storming in and demanding his guitar but the guitar belonged to Miguel's great grandfather, this would reveal to Miguel who his great grandfathwr trully is.

It was a fine, formuliac affair (I worked out Hector's identity real damn fast) and the designs were great but it really didn't do anything too special for me spare the incredible concert scene at the end and the catharsis of the irony bell death.

Book of Life had such vibrancy with its characters. The twins alone have more interesting design, concept and dynamic than any of Miguel's family.

One thing I credit is that where BoL taught the culture it was displaying (even framing the story as a cultural exchange/lesson), Coco is unabashedly steeped in that culture which plays more genuine and gives a lot more humanity to the characters, especially in the living segment.

The issue really comes down to construction (and length obviously). A Pixar short has a very specific core idea that is explored quickly and efficiently. It's a one act at the most. Here you have some built not only to have a traditional three-act structure but also to have songs and commercial breaks. So it doesn't feel cinematic in any way. It just feels like you are watching a TV episode before your movie. 

I think this was a terrible move by Disney. Now people who have no idea why this short was so long they must be terrified next time they go to the next Pixar film.

It's been four years since the first Frozen and there's a good chance a lot of their initial audience has grown beyond its initial explosion in pop culture. Disney more than anything relies on brands, whether it's for theme parks, cruise ships or merchandise and likely they already had this thing produced as a TV special so they saw it as an easy way to drum up interest in the franchise again.

However the film itself felt simultaneously too long and too short. It seemed eager to reintroduce us to a lot of characters and add in a few new songs but it didn't have enough groundwork in place for it to really earn its emotional ending. Definitely would have played better on the small screen, it's flaws were even more apparent when placed next to an A-tier Pixar movie. Felt a few of the shots and environments were kind of flat and lacking the amount of detail and charm you'd typically find in a theatrically released short.

Are those strong and heavy beats throughout the film? Or is it more lumpy?

I found both Up and TS3 to be essentially really terrific, moving, highly emotional 10 minutes that would have made an amazing stand-alone short, followed by (in the case of Up) or mostly preceded by (for TS3) 120 minutes of pedestrian low ball to mid ball comedy. If I'm flipping channels and see one of them, I'll probably only stop if I'll see that great 10 minutes soon.

Compare to, say, Ratatouille or The Incredibles. They may not be as strong emotionally, but the emotion seems better connection to the rest of the movie. If I'm flipping channels and one of those comes on, I'm far more likely to stop no matter where it is in the movie.

Or that they just didn’t get “it”?

Im not Latino but could relate to Coco in that, the Chinese culture has a similar day called “tomb day” where your family visits and clean ups family tombs at the cemetery, offer food, burn paper money and paper clothes (so that it goes to them in the afterlife), and pray to them. It’s not as huge as dia de los muertos and I don’t think as personal (we don’t have anything similar to ofrendas). 

But the movie really hit me because my grandma who raised us and lived with us had Alzheimer’s and any scene with mama coco gave me the water works. like in the beginning when she perked up and said “papa???” cause she can’t remember he died... oh god I’m gonna start crying again.",7eoph7

>Do the customs workers ever get to visit their families? Maybe you say they don't have families. Well why don't they disappear?


Yes, they do! The cop that sets Hector free in the beggining of the movie says that he is going to let him go because he wants to see his family before Día de muertos ends.


>If you only disappear when you're no longer remembered, why didn't the guy in the hammock survive? Miguel says he remembers him, but Hector says it doesn't work that way. How does he know? Miguel's the first living person to visit TLotD. 


Hector explains that the memories have to be formed in the land of the living. Miguel met hammock guy in the LotD, so, sadly, it doesn't count. Now, how does Hector know this? That I don't know.


>How are spirit animals decided? Why does his GGGrandma get a sick ass flying cat and Miguel get a retarded dog? And why don't his other family members have any?


They never say but my guess is that they are linked to your personality. Frida Kahlo gets a monkey because there is a painting she made where one appears in her shoulder, just like in the movie! And GGGrandma gets the badass spirit because she is badass too, I would say.",7eoph7

dq82exd,"Why do some of the dead have jobs?
Well it's a society, they probably have their own currency and they need to earn money to live well.

What's the economic situation in TLotD?
It appears that the richest people are the ones that are more remembered (like De la Cruz and Frida Kahlo) while the mostly forgotten live in the slums.

Do the customs workers ever get to visit their families? 
Yes, one of them says so. I imagine they take shifts.

Why didn't the guy in the hammock survive? 
The memories had to be created in the land of the living, they explain that. Hector knows because of plot convenience, although it is possible that another human had been in the land of the dead before.

How are spirit animals decided?
Who knows really. They appear to work as guardian angels and it is hinted by Frida Kahlo that all of them are equally as powerful. However Alebrijes don't have any relationship whatsoever with the Day of the Dead and IMO the movie could have worked around them.

Where's Coco's husband?
He was the short man that was traveling with the family

Dante's breed is Xoloitzcuintli (or just Xolo), also known as Mexican Hairless Dog. In Mexico it's known for its importance in ancient Native American cultures. Quoting [Wikipedia's article on the Xoloitzcuintli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Hairless_Dog):
>Long regarded as guardians and protectors, the indigenous peoples believed that the Xolo would safeguard the home from evil spirits as well as intruders. In ancient times the Xolos were often sacrificed and then buried with their owners to act as guide to the soul on its journey to the underworld.

>Xolos were considered sacred dogs by the Aztecs, Toltecs, Maya, and other groups.

In fact, [Frida Kahlo (who in real life was a famous contemporary painter and loved Xolos) explains this when she meets Miguel and sees Dante.](#spoiler) (Fun fact: [she was also married to muralist Diego Rivera who also appears briefly in this scene, and in the Xolo Wikipedia article you can see a photo of him with one of these dogs.](#spoiler) My God, all the references to Mexican culture in this movie are so sublime I swear I'm crying right now.)

Regarding that [chicken bone theory, it might be true, but why didn't Dante gradually turn into a skeleton too?](#spoiler) Anyway, it might've been a nod to this part of the Xolo myth (also quoting from Wikipedia):

>According to Aztec mythology, the god Xolotl made the Xoloitzcuintli from a sliver of the Bone of Life from which all mankind was made. Xolotl gave this gift to Man with the instruction to guard it with his life and in exchange it would guide Man through the dangers of Mictlan, the world of Death, toward the Evening Star in the Heavens.

In short, [Dante was *always* a spirit guide. When Frida says he probably wasn't, I saw it like ""this dog breed was *said* to be a spirit guide in ancient cultures. Oh, wait, maybe the myth isn't true, this dog doesn't seem smart."" Just a little comedy moment, you know?](#spoiler)

>Maybe he earned it fully by watching over Miguel in the spirit world?

[That's when he turned into an alebrije, but yes, you could say that he ""earned it fully"" at that point, he physically and visibly became a supernatural being.](#spoiler)

I did like that it was so location specific -- it wasn't happening in Anytown, Generic Country to appeal to the broadest possible audience; it was set in a specific country and culture and appealed to the audience by showing something we all have in common, even though it manifests itself very differently in different places.

Miguel didn't have any of Chicharrón's stories passed down to him, so even though he knew *of* him, he didn't have enough memories of his life to save him from being forgotten.

I liked the character overall though. I found him suspect the minute his party looked so over the top, Hollywood style and very VIP. Like everyone else was celebrating with family or going back to their families but he didn’t. He made the celebration about himself and his movies. A big hint that he wasn’t his great grandfather was how he was surprised he had a great grand son, when Miguel’s family immediately knew who he was despite dying before he was born. Upon second viewing I think Ernesto knew it was impossible that he had a great grandson because he probably never got to have kids and died young, but he played along for attention and to look good because Miguel was being talked about a lot.

My showing had the statement from Unkrich, Anderson and Molina at the beginning as well, and Unkrich at least is in Europe right now so yeah, they knew something might be going down. I imagine they filmed the segment and hoped they wouldn't have to use it, but that's how it goes. Personally I don't feel particularly bad about going to see it, since (a) Lasseter's already made his money and is almost certain to be gone now, what's done is done, (b) the people who will get laid off if Disney and Pixar movies bomb will not be John Lasseter and (c) if you want to avoid every movie he's ever had a hand in, well, good luck with that.

dq847z5,"That’s like saying all Christmas movies are unnecessary because you only need one. Just like there are many movies about Christmas there can be many movies about other holidays. The book of life was fun but it wasn’t that deep. It lacked emotion. It also had a few stereotypes, while Coco was very accurate in even the smallest details. As far as which one was a more accurate representation of the culture and Mexico, Coco definitely takes the prize. The Book of Life has a few elements that were very Hollywood and not necessarily super faithful to the real thing. Tiny details, but Coco was perfectly accurate. 

You can’t compare the soundtracks either. Coco’s music will definitely get Oscar nods.

Lol, it's not even in the same ballpark as Toy Story 1/2/3, Inside Out, Wall-E, Up, or Finding Nemo. Visually it was amazing, but the story was pretty generic, the ending was cliche, the music was forgettable, it wasn't that funny, the twist was pretty obvious, and I can't think of a single quotable line in the movie. 

All this over the top praise being heaped onto this movie seems undeserved after you've seen it. I think people just want to like it so much because it's pretty and it's a Pixar movie, and they've fooled themselves into believing it's more than it is. I'm sure if this movie depicts your culture it will hold a special place in your heart, but to say it's a ""top 3"" Pixar movie? Nah.

It would've been a little better if they at least added that he was sending money home to the family (and maybe when it stopped--because he died--the wife assumed he didn't care anymore).

I know it would've taken a total rewrite of the story in the movie, but I really would've been pleasantly surprised if de la Cruz had been the great guy and musician Miguel expected, but done something else besides turn into a villain. Maybe Miguel gets to him after a long adventure and de la Cruz pats him on the shoulder and gives him some hard-hitting advice about how music and seizing your moment is great, but that he had to abandon his family to fully realize his dream. How he regrets what he did somewhat, but would do it again because it's what he wanted. He made that choice and he has to live (die?) with the consequences, and Miguel will have to live with the consequences of his actions, too. 

Miguel is forced to actually look at his relationship with his family and make a tough decision. Even if they decided to make it a compromise where he plays music and still learns to make shoes or something.

This short was just full of corny dialogue and jokes (I laughed a few times at Olaf but even his jokes were stale/predictable because they were exactly the same as all his other jokes), and forgettable music. I also feel like they retconned a relationship between Elsa and Anna while Elsa was always locked away.

Or, considering Hector keeps trying to reach the land of the living even when the bridge clearly isn't working for him, extremely desperate people still trying to use the bridge and subsequently falling into whatever is below it could be a problem big enough that they need security. 

Alternatively, since otherwise it'd be a pretty ridiculous coincidence that the sole entrance to the Land of the Dead happens to be in Miquel's small town, it's possible there are a bunch of these security checkpoints, it's less seeing if your picture's on an ofrenda, more seeing if it's on an ofrenda in that town.

For what *Book of Life* did on a $50 million budget, and was a much smaller project (with the director-creator basically coming up with everything himself), it's a pretty good film. *Coco* takes a similar concept to much greater heights, due to having a lot more money (and a much wider team of employees) at its disposal.",7eoph7
dqbrddd,">  It was well researched...the subject matter was meticulously respected to the highest degree

You do know that *Book of Life* was all but entirely devised, written, and made by a Mexican director, Jorge Gutierrez, as opposed to the team of white American guys and ""consultants"" that Disney-Pixar hired for, and who worked on, *Coco*, right? 

Seeing posts like this upvoted, that clearly champion *Coco* while spreading misinformation about *Book of Life* - and, not only that, tries to imply that *Book of Life* was somehow ""disrespectful / not faithful / not researched"" to Mexican culture - is really insulting to *Book of Life*, which was a good film in its own regards. It's also dishonest.

I mean, it's not like the director of *Book of Life*, y'know, literally grew up in Mexico, and knew all about the Day of the Dead, or anything.../s 

> *Coco* is superior in every aspect

That's because it was done by a much larger studio, with a much larger budget. *Book of Life* had only a $50 million budget to work with; *Coco* had a $175-200 million budget, by comparison. More money meant much better effects, hiring better teams, etc. For $50 million, what *Book of Life* did was no less than respectable.

In some customs the glass being flipped over is to show that you've drank all the liquor in the glass and adding to it could be a sign of respect, that you've finished the whole drink. 

Other customs see it as an invitation to fight or even buy another shot. I saw it as a sign of respect as well as showing that although the friend has disappeared from the afterlife, he's still respecting the custom of shot etiquette.",7eoph7

It started crying so hard when older Murph came on to the screen. I lost it. I cried a couple more times. The crescendo of perfect editing with the sound/music/story when he goes into the black hole and knows what is really going on was too amazing. It really is like we are/will be ghosts for our children and that they are our future that can save us. If we cared for our children with that much ideal, then we would be different people fundamentally. Something profound I suppose. Science and emotion put together makes a grown dude cry for the first time. I had to sit there and take in the movie after the credits rolled. Never been so overwhelmed by a movie.

Adrian Molina, who co-directed Coco and is a Pixar veteran, is of Mexican descent. I'm sure Jorge Gutiérrez had a team of white American guys help him out, no? Come on.


>  *Book of Life* had only a $50 million budget to work with; *Coco* had a $175-200 million budget, by comparison. More money meant much better effects, hiring better teams, etc. For $50 million, what *Book of Life* did was no less than respectable.

It was respectable, no one will argue that. I'm actually happy that Guillermo del Toro helped out on the storyboards for Book of Life and without his input, it could have been something else. As a person of Mexican descent, I feel like Coco treated the subject matter with even more respect though. It was just properly researched, it made me feel like I was actually in Mexico celebrating this holiday with family. Book of Life was trying too hard to appeal to audiences in my view and it came off as annoying. It didn't have the same emotional connection that Coco was able to emulate.

It’s good that there is more than one point of reference now. As someone who also grew up celebrating this day, and as someone who has been everywhere in Mexico and has seen countless little towns and cities, Coco is by far the most accurate in its depiction of the culture and the country. Also, Coco had dozens of Mexican artists working on this movie. It wasn’t entirely made by Americans. They had real artists, musicians, designers and consultants working on this project tirelessly. That’s why it’s so perfect. People knew what they were doing. Coco is far more superior to the Book of life in many ways. The Book of Life had several details that were not particularly accurate, such as the Spanish hats and some costumes, which also looked more Spanish than Mexican, among other stuff. Coco didn’t have a single mistake and they explained this holiday much better. Plus, you cannot compare the quality of the music and the animation.

Plus nobody WANTS to carry him over because everyone else is already satisfied with what they already have; the freedom to go to the living world whenever they want (on the day of the dead at least). I'm sure there's some sort of parallel to be drawn to immigration in that as well.

Also keep in mind they have to maintain consistency with the day of the dead as well; that being said the whole point of the day of the dead is to remember your deceased loved ones/relatives, and to hope that they cross/visit you and hear your prayers.

As for positive vs negative memories, a famous person remembered positively would have a lot of ofrendas and gifts of food, items etc -- good currency.

It's a common misconception that the islands speak different dialects of Filipino. In truth, it's more accurate to say that each island has its own language that has common roots with the rest of the islands. Bisaya for example has a completely different syntax from most other dialects and Chabacano is basically spanish with heavy filipino influence.

If I were to order the frequency of languages spoken, I guess it would be something similar to this:
Local Dialect>English>Second dialect>Second Language

dqemvjg,"Sorry for mistaking you, but I'm confused as to what you're trying to say.  There was no knowledge by anyone but Coco that she had the photo (and it had been long established the photo wasn't necessary, but the memory was, and the memory didn't need s photo).  It was a sweet scene, but as you said, Miguel's knowledge came from the and of the dead and he needed to spread the knowledge to save Hector.  Miguel didn't know Coco would say anything significant to him or his family or that she had an keepsakes.

Lastly, I know you're not the other guy, but I'm thought I explained Hector's justice would be the knowledge of his murder.  He's still known as a deadbeat dad and Ernesto as just a thief.",7eoph7
dqelt1d,"Nope.  I double checked last night. In that scene, Hector said the memory OF when the the person was alive only counts.  That's why Ernesto isn't on trouble, when everyone who remembers him only does so by songs they heard from bands, radio, TV, or records (if I took bathroom breaks, how'd I miss this?)

Tour guides just get instructions, which is why they an pass the memory on.

Miguel could definitely have passed on knowledge of Hector (Hector wanted him to in the first place.  It's be impossible to just shove a photo into someone's shrine without repercussions).",7eoph7

Darabont knows how to make some great stuff. Usually when I'm tired, I get more emotional. As I've gotten older, I don't really care what people say about my behavior when I watch a movie. If the movie gets, it will get me to that place. Interstellar is a curve ball that hit me in the place so much. I was fighting so many tears in the movie.

dqdroux,"I understand the “power of art” as well as the idea of pushing yourself to the limit for the sake of it, but murder is a whole nother level ^(I can’t believe I’m arguing this). People don’t agonize over art they don’t know exists...well...not existing. If someone doesn’t use their talent, the world keeps on spinning.

For example, were you to, say...murder your songwriter becasue he wants to see his daughter, no song is going to bring him back for her no matter how much solace she may find in his music. “Making people’s lives better through art” and “destroy lives” are opposites ^(I can’t believe I’m arguing this).

Keep in mind, within the movie, de la Cruz is a freeloader. If anything, Hector should be your hero: he tried to keep his integrity, and died because of it. And he totally did the right thing: just because you’re talented doesn’t mean you owe anyone anything. Otherwise, you get people like [this](http://www.popbuzz.com/tv-film/stranger-things/finn-wolfhard-rude-fan-video/).

Murder isn’t *ever* the price for a masterpiece ^(I can’t believe I’m arguing this). Like I said, if someone did that they were probably pretty bad to begin with.",7eoph7

dw880k2,"Yes, it’s a very old tradition we do every year. Many families don’t do it though because it’s too sad or hard for them. So it’s not like absolutely everyone puts altars, but they do celebrate the day in other ways. I always have to be the one in my family to initiate everything in Día de Muertos because for my parents it’s too sad and difficult to put altars and see their loved ones there. Especially because both have lost siblings in recent years. It can be a very emotional experience when someone passed recently and you have to put them in the altar. Especially the first time you put their picture there. It’s not fun. It’s a beautiful but sad tradition. Other families don’t put altars in their homes. They go to the cemetery and put the offerings around their loved one’s headstone. Flowers, candles, food, etc. But that happens mostly in small, colonial towns like the one depicted in the movie. City people tend to be a little bit more closed off to those old traditions. Little towns preserve the traditions better. ",7eoph7
