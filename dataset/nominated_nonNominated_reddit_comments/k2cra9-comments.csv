gdtlvcc,"This movie can be summed up by the one cut to the reindeers face while Santa was flying... aka what the hell was that.

It certainly did not live up to the first one, but to be fair it was more original than the majority of Christmas movies these days. One thing is for sure though, it could have done without that musical number...",k2cra9
gdv1o29,The dad's favorite song was O Christmas Tree. I mentally checked out of this movie after that scene. No one's favorite song is O Christmas Tree.,k2cra9
gdtlxtz,"I am watching it now, and the most annoying thing for my 4 year old daughter is how many subtitles there are but she is cuddling mom enjoying the movie. My 7 year old is loving it, like calling out to the screen and jumping around. I think its awful, obviously I'm writing this rather than watching. Worst part, my kids like it so much I'm definitely going to have to watch it a few more times.

Just noticed the gold! Thanks for the gift first ever!",k2cra9
gduy1ki,I liked how they acknowledged Santa Claus' origins as a bishop in 4th century Anatolia. Never seen a movie attempt to bring the story of the original St. Nicholas into the fold of modern-day Santa Claus mythology before.,k2cra9
gdtgyrc,"Watched it yesterday, a lot of ""what the fuck"" when it came to some of it. But I didn't hate it. Perfectly fine silly movie.",k2cra9
gdtxtqc,Maybe one of the worst casting decisions I‚Äôve seen with Belsnickel. The movie just couldn‚Äôt go anywhere with him in such a pivotal role,k2cra9

The biggest WTF thing for me is that the parents ditch all the kids to go off resort for a night, in a foreign country no less.",k2cra9

Felt underdeveloped and rushed. Plus they switched out the humor for a more adventurous tone and that was a bad choice.",k2cra9
ge5m5jo,A LOT of subtitles for a movie made for kids 10 and under.,k2cra9
gecqs57,"Seems to be the unpopular opinion in this thread, but I actually liked this one a lot better than the first movie. It definitely fell into some heavy sequel tropes, but the story felt a lot more cohesive instead a bunch of strung together set pieces. Not a masterpiece or anything, but Christmas movies don‚Äôt have to be ‚Äúgood‚Äù in the traditional sense. I enjoyed it and could imagine rewatching it again in later years.",k2cra9
gdttcye,"Why, oh why, did they choose to do an original musical number with so many amazing Christmas songs they could have pulled from? Terrible disappointment. The rest of the movie was passable, with a bad villain and way too much action. Overall... meh.",k2cra9
ge5ssuq,"Should have gone with a different casting. The villain amounted to teenage angst. Movie would have been over if Santa gave him a hug or something idk. Acting felt forced and quite flat to me. Loved the first one but this one leaves a lot to be desired.

However, the Christmas/North Pole town was pretty sick though.",k2cra9
gdtnblr,"Yeah this sucks. The elves were the worst part of the first movie, now here's an entire movie about Santa's village and the elves. Also I'm pretty sure it was 95% CGI or green screen.",k2cra9
gdv5akc,I really just don't like the New Zealand actor kid. Hated him in Deadpool 2 as well. I don't know what it is exactly but he really takes me out of the movie.,k2cra9

That's when I stopped watching",k2cra9
gdtjpjq,"I loved the first movie. This one was terrible. Kurt Russel doesn‚Äôt get to shine at all as Santa. Mrs. Claus was useless and annoying. Rehashing the dead dad storyline AGAIN that I thought we resolved in the first movie was a total waste of the script. And the elves (which are weird looking, kinda creepy, super annoying, and the worst part of the first movie) are the main focus. Don‚Äôt get me started on how bad that villain was. Just awful. Hated it.",k2cra9
gehd74l,"I hate this movie only  because it got more press and  promotion the Klaus ever did. 

Klaus has yet to ever be in Netflixs top ten, despite Arctic Dog and Duck Duck Gose being Abel too.  And I'm so pissed they  gave this movie a big add campaign, so everyone will watch this movie, instead of discovering Klaus",k2cra9
ge2kltm,Best part of this movie was seeing Sunny Suljic towards the end. Hope to see boi in a lot more stuff going forward.,k2cra9
ge3t5ra,"It was alright, although they had the least threatening villain of all time",k2cra9
geavchy,Its got a longer ending than The Lord of the Rings.,k2cra9
gf2nurv,"I liked it, but just like everyone else it seems, I think the first one was better. The first one perfectly blended fantasy and reality. It felt like what would really happen if it happened in real life. This one is just too unrealistic to give off that vibe. But that's a good thing. A movie and its sequel should feel different from each other.

I love the 1990 airport scene. Time travel is a favorite of mine and this movie used it in a simple but great way. Even if the thing with the batteries doesn't make sense. What's Santa doing with unopened 6-year-old batteries in his pocket? Why didn't they just have him not have batteries at all? And since when do batteries expire? Also, Kate stole the batteries from the gift shop.",k2cra9

gg2cbv8,Wait... this shit was directed by the *Home Alone* director??,k2cra9
gghav2l,I was very disappointed with this one. I loved the first one but this one did not do it for me at all. The villain had go away heat w/ me. I did like the predictable moment when she's interacting w/ her father. I feel like I would've been BALLIN' crying though.,k2cra9
gh0ejtc,This movie felt way too long and the acting just felt bad. The original cast from the first movie did a great job but the rest was just bad. The elves look like honestly nightmare fuel.,k2cra9
geyic73,"I know this is primarily a movie for kids but here are my thoughts on it:
The first movie was surprisingly good (I saw it one week before seeing the second so I am comparing them quite a bit) it was kind of a twist on a typical childrens christmas movie with more adult humor and action, I mean santa stealing a car and a police chase come on its gold. The only thing I didn't enjoy in the first one were the elves, though I completely accepted them since they  made the movie much more enjoyable for kids. In the sequel however they decided to double down on the elves and everytging that goes with it, p.e. humor for children, a really simple plot etc. I understand that it was probably a WAY more profitable approach to go with the highly marketable minion-like creatures but thats makes the movie unfaithful to the first one and -what i believe- it stood for. For me it was a way for adult not only to enjoy a movie for kids but to enjoy christmas overall and be filled with joy and christmas spirit. On the other hand, Christmas Chronicles 2 is just a plain old fashioned kids christmas movie with some mediocre action. Even if the lesson the characters and the audience ""learn"" at the end is to value and love our families even in tough conditions which isn't a bad thing to teach children, it is completely ruined for me since instead of using the plot and decent character development, the movie just spits it on our faces in the end through dialogue. That's not the only case of needless explanations throughout the film. Such types of dialogue thrive in the hands of the ""antagonist"" who instead of being menacing through his actions is always having one liners such as ""You are going to pay Santa"" while talking to himself. It's not just the lacklaster villain though but the dissapointing choices for the heroes as well. Let me just say WHY WASN'T TEDDY IN THE DAMN MOVIE? He was our protagonist in the previous movie along with his sister and the means to make the movie more accessible to older audiences. But since this one is just for kids we should forget about him and give Kate (our protagonist) a goofy kid sidekick. I don't have any problem whatsoever with the cast mind you just with the writing. I don't want to go into any more detail since i didn't even intend to write this much about a movie series I don't really care about. I am just going to say that the plot and pacing left me bored to the bone with all the aforementioned flaws and more making me cringe and in the end disliking the film. Overall, I would not recommend watching this movie and wasting your evening unless you are watching it with your kids. Instead you could watch Klaus, also on Netflix, which I too intend to see because of the overhaul of positive comments and reviews it has gotten. Or just watch Home alone again...

3/10",k2cra9
geyks55,"They went back in time, then come back 15 second behind belsnickle so they can steal that star thing but you can't just come back.to your time line at a different time. Have people not seen Rick and Morty? That shit fuck the world up. Biggest plot hole in any film I've ever seen.

How did no one see a giant red sleigh in the sky, with 8 floating raindeer at the end in Mexico? People were all around on the beach, how did no one spot that?",k2cra9
geoaftw,"I just watched this and I liked it. It was fun, easy watching Christmas movie with a more adventurous twist than many Christmas Santa movies. Kurt plays a great Santa (probably my favorite), and Goldie was a good choice for Mrs. 

I didn‚Äôt like Bellsnickle though (the Fire fist kid from Deadpool 2) it just didn‚Äôt match, and I felt like he was gonna throw a fireball at any second. 

The origins of Santa part was a neat and refreshing, you don‚Äôt see that at all in Santa movies. I‚Äôd watch it again for sure. 

I feel like some people forget that this is primarily a children‚Äôs movie, yet are unreasonably expecting something much, much more from the actors, the storyline, the dialogue, the CGI, etc.",k2cra9
gdv99sd,"Very confused about the airport scene in the 90s.
In the first movie a home video from 2006 and the dad looks mid 40s yet the daughter travels back to 1990 and meets her own dad who is no older then 13 making him about 29-30 in 2006.",k2cra9
gerio45,"Watched this last night, liked the original more. One thing I couldn't get over was the time travel scene. DOES HE NOT KNOW THAT HE MET HIS DAUGHTER FROM THE FUTURE? Do time loops not exist in this universe?

Obviously I am asking questions that are unable to be answered, perhaps it's the hot chocolate kicking in.

Overall wouldn't watch again. Unless tempted with cookies.",k2cra9

gh1e3ei,"Kurt and Goldie were the only enjoyable parts of this movie. The plot was contrived and some of the elf-cocaine moments were insane in the worst way. 
I really thought they killed off one of Santa‚Äôs Reindeer and it infuriated me.
I did really like seeing Goldie on screen, though. They didn‚Äôt give her much to do but each scene she looked like she was having an absolute blast. 

Also, Kurt‚Äôs beard and hair were lion-levels of regal.

Also ALSO, it‚Äôs a terrible start when the actor you have playing an elf can‚Äôt even say his own damn name. I get it that he‚Äôs from New Zealand but maybe alter it a bit for the guy.",k2cra9
gh7ont1,Kate‚Äôs hair is awful in this movie. Someone needed to part it. The lions mane at the top was terrible looking. The curls could be great but how it was styled was terrible.,k2cra9
ggb0j86,"The movie could have been better if it wasn't filled with cringy bits and completely unrealistic bits like where they were sent to the north pole and where going 5 miles per hour then when the cart turns they fly at 120 miles an hour which made no sense. When they are in the clouds they lose how they actually can freeze up there like in the first movie. Some of the jokes were semi-funny like when they were strolling through the town that Mrs. Clause built. Santa was explaining how his village was built by Mrs. Clause and she basically says that things should change. That isn't a bad thing but I don't want to hear SJW shit in a Christmas movie. In all, I give the movie a 4/10 just because the script sucked but the acting is what gave it the extra few points.",k2cra9

hlvno4b,"I fucking hate Kate in this movie, she's a whiny brat who refuses to be happy even though she has no reason not to be, she has a great new stepdad, a sweet little brother, her mother is finally happy, and her brother is in a good mood and isn't bullying her yet she throws tantrums and is horrible to her stepdad who only ever tries to make her feel better but she just cannot appreciate it at all because her dad died years ago, my dad died this morning but years later I wont be like this, god damn.

ghq4lse,"Yeah, I just finished it and came here expecting to see some jokes and stuff like that, not pure dislike and indiference.

The 'O Christmas Tree' finale was pretty cringe, but I liked the rest a lot. The elfs are villains in a +18 movie with all those chainsaws, Kurt Russell is a perfect Santa, and it didn't feel boring at any point. Would I watch it again? Idk, maybe with friends to have a laugh and not much else; but as far as christmas movies go, this falls in line with the first one as a harmless but enjoyable film for the season for me.

Don't get me wrong, the first one felt much more original and I think it's a better film no doubt, but the worst I could say about this one is that it's guilty of taking the generic route, not that it's unwatchable or plain bad.


Also, Teddy 100% banged off-screened and that's why he's not mad he missed all the fun.
