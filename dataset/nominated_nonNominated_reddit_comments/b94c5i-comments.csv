\- if he can't say the name clearly it won't work (like if he's underwater)  

\- the lighting is usually piercing enough to pass thru a roof, but in case it gets blocked, another lighting will come down (like when he was in the mall and the first lighting got blocked by the plastic roof and the second one broke it)  

\- I liked how he used the lighting offensively too by putting his enemy in between, reminds me of that cartoon where he grabs I think it's Superman? and just Shazams the shit outta him

Pedro found the book and handed it off to Eugene which enabled Billy to meet his mom again and realize that he already has a family waiting for him. Darla showed how dedicated she was fo Billy even though she didn't know him by keeping a secret although she's terrible at them. Everyone helped in their own way.

I especially enjoyed the scene with Billy and Mary as he's trying to convince her to leave the family for college.

ek8e2lu,"(I was told to post this here, instead of a lone post)

I apologize if I get my terms mixed up, but I was simply amazed when I came to the realization that Billy had to overcome all seven deadly sins as the hero, before he could defeat them. 

In the movie, our main character gains his powers, and soon finds he has his villain, but unknown to him, his super-villain is all too familiar to him, as he’s been fighting the underlying problem/villain throughout the entire movie and his life as a foster child. I hope you guys enjoy my short analysis, and be sure to let me know if I missed anything, or if you have any corrections!

A little explanation: throughout the film, Billy (Main character) encounters the seven deadly sins in his activities as the hero, starting with gluttony, when he first stops the robbery at the convenience store. After the robbery is stopped, we see our main character walk out of the store with the beer he first intended to buy, we then see him spit it out in disgust, and we cut to him walking back out of the shop with arms full of drinks and snacks (gluttony).

Next, we see him basking in the glory of people noticing him and wanting pictures, with him wanting money for the pictures (greed). 

It’s during this introductory period of the film where we see him visit a gentlemen’s club, assumed to just be a small laugh in the script, but this is the location he chooses to travel to when he leaves the lair with his brothers and sisters. The fact that the club was the first safe location he thought of shows he had a connection to the thought of the location, and most like the women (lust). 

On Billy’s first day of school, his foster brother gets hit by some asshole in a truck, who proceeds to exit and starts to harass the crippled foster brother, who jokes with them about the incident, showing the teenagers from the truck are familiar with this kid, and we’re left to assume these are the kid’s bullies. Billy walks away as the brother is getting his ass beat, but stops when one of the bullies mentions the kid calling out for his mom (I assume this was a joke about him being a foster child). This strikes a nerve with Billy, who stops, turns around, and continues to attack the bullies, without thinking about who he’s doing it for, and without realizing what would happen to him after his attack (wrath).

I believe Billy is jealous of kids who have a stable family, shown by his consistent search for his mother, and hatred of foster homes. All he wants is his own mother, and it leads to him being an absolute hellion of a foster child, as we see throughout the first half of the film (envy).

Now pride and sloth were tricky to me, as he seemed to portray pride throughout most of the movie with almost all of his outings as the hero, which I believed to be coinciding with greed, but the fact he feels so special that people should pay him money to take a picture. Sloth was definitely the hardest to pick out, and I decided it was fitting to tie it with the fact he was skipping school in his first phase of being the hero, and it was nothing to him.

I apologize for the poor explanations, and if I’m wrong with any, or the overall idea (specifically me stating it as the motif), I’m new to analyzing movies, and I figured a few of you might appreciate this.",b94c5i

The contrast between Billy/Shazam works if you understand that Shazam is actually more childish than Billy because the superpowers are an outlet for him after he's just had his whole life crushed. So he's far more joyous whilst as Shazam until he gets beaten.

They also best explained why Billy gets chosen more than other interpretations.

Character development and motivations felt organic, like it wasn't pushed along by the plot but came from the natural progression of the character.

Billy seems to be really grounded and not as goofy while Shazam acts younger than 15. Billy doesn't seem to have that great of that chemistry with the foster kids while Shazam did. It made it feel that Billy and Shazam were two entirely different people rather than one being an adult version of the other. I really wish they made Billy a lot less somber and incorporated more of Freddy's personality into him in order to make the goofier Zack Levi Shazam work.

The script was just great and most of the actors are doing a great job. Zachary Levi was a perfect pick, the kid actors for most of the time were really good, and a surprisingly standout performance from Cooper Andrews (foster dad). 

I certainly don’t think it’s perfect though. I thought the villain & the seven sins were under-written considering how much screen time they got. I think Mark Strong did a good job with what he had but overall his character fell flat. If we wanna get nit picky there are a certainly a lot of plot conveniences but this is a movie about a teenager transforming into a lightening spewing adult in a cheesy suit by saying a name so i’m not gonna complain too much.

I think what makes this better than Wonder Woman was that it stuck it’s landing while WW lost all its momentum in the final bits.

I kept playing that part over and over in my head on the drive home and laughing at it. I thought it was fantastic. But the fact that they couldn’t get Cavill really bums me out, because it’s just a reminder that Superman and Batman are both circled with dysfunction. They’re trying to build up this big universe that is supposedly connected, but they can’t commit to it fully because the universe was built off of dysfunction. 

Out of the 7 movies in the DCEU we’ve gotten so far, I’ve enjoyed all of the solo films. That seems to be their bread and butter. I’m excited for the future of these franchises...but I still want to see these characters meet up again, and that scene bummed me out because we have no idea how or when we’ll see Batman and Superman again.

ekaf7z6," My quick thoughts on this solid film:

I was floored with how much this movie made me care about their characters. I was moved by its protagonist and hence was ecstatic to watch the origins of a true superhero. First of all, huge props to Asher Angel and Jack Dylan Grazer. Can I just hang out with them? Wow.. they reminded me of myself from 5-6 years ago! The two actors brought so much to the role, they took this brotherly friendship and brought shockingly real emotion into it. I felt triumphant when they did, anger when they did, joy when they did and undertood all the crazy shenanigans that they played out. When you have two leads like that... Could it get any better? YES! ZACHARY LEVI AS SHAZAM IS PHENOMENAL. WOW! I didnt love the casting at first but my god... He convincingly plays a 15 year old to perfection, Nails every line of dialogue, and most importantly brings out sincerity. Shazam in the comics always looks up to superman, well Zach Levi, since DC dont know what to do with their greatest hero... you're all we got, and my god am I thankful. I really feel like Shazam captures what it means to be a superhero.

While the friendship between Billy/Freddie and the second act of the film, which involves superpower shenanigans, is the highlight for me, this movie has other huge postives. Everything about the family dynamic was beautifully done. Family is the most important thing in life, and this movie gets that. This movie shows you why that is, ugh, theres so much impressed by and so much I want to say about this but I can't cause spoilers. But wow, some deserved tearjerker moments regarding family and how being a part of one (whether bonded by blood or not) is so insanely beautiful. The jokes and one liners..... AHHHH 95% of them landed and lmao I was rollling on the floor laughing, Zach Levi!!!!!!

Now. I do have a bunch of complaints, i thought the villain was weak, I love Mark Stong but he was wasted in this role. I totally fet the parallel behind Billy and the villain and I get what they were trying to do, but it was really poorly executed. They had a 3 dimensional villain to play with but he just came off as one note. The movie also ran on for a tad too long, I think they could have shaved a few goofy moments (again, the goofs involving the villain didnt work but did when Zach pulled it off!!). The final battle got a tiny bit tiresome, though had some fannnnnntasssticccc moments! Like AAAA moments I so wanna takk about but AAAAAA.

Shocked they pulled off the Shazam family so well (even though I wish the final battle was a bit shorter)

Also, the last scene in this movie!!!

There's so much more I can praise. The supporting cast were brilliant, the music was well done, I particularly loved Shazams upbeat/uplifiting theme and I also like the way it was shot (felt low budget but in the best way. Down to earth and real!)

I'd personally give it an 8.5/10

I knew little to nothing about Shazam before going into this and seeing a hero for the first time again made me remember what it was like seeing Iron Man back in 2008.

That shit gets stale, and they need to chill out and learn to enjoy some other themes. 

I definitely enjoyed it and got a good laugh from a number of parts. Wouldn't call it perfect, but it's definitely one of the better movies released recently. My expectations were not high and that probably had something to do with it tbh, but as long as you're not too crazy of an arm chair critic expecting the next big super hero masterpiece, you should definitely check it out.

ekg8wb4,"It stayed true to the source material. Shazam as a superhero was meant to embody a hero thats a child, with it being his greatness weakness, but also his strength. Thats why i liked the film, it didnt try to take itself seriously. It was never meant to be a detective movie like Batman, or Superman’s internal struggle of being a god, or the empowerment of a certain marginalized or minority class.

So if you found it cliche and cheesy, thats okay, because it was meant to be that way. Shazam doesnt try to be something else, just a fun take on a child in Superman’s body. 

With that said, Captain Marvel (Shazam) has some great standalone comics. They’re all light hearted and genuine.",b94c5i

I just wish they had somehow >!made an actual tiger transform alongside the Family!< like in the comics.

Billy has no sense of humor, barely talks, a relatively flat affect and almost no personality. Shazam is basically funny the entire time and is never not talking. They seem as different as night and day.

Freddy on the other hand seems a whole lot more like Shazam. They even made black haired Freddy be a brown haired adult while brown haired Billy becomes black haired Shazam.

Mary is an adult already so I don't know why they switched actresses.

Finally Billy's mom did not look 17 at all. She looked 30ish which really through me off as to why she would abandon her son. If she was 17, she must have given birth around 12-13.",b94c5i

I liked that it wasn’t the typical boy searches for mom and finds her and they live happily ever after story. You felt just as bummed as Billy when, after all this work to find her, realizes his mother was a selfish woman who abandoned him to unburden herself. He then realized he had all the family he needed in his foster siblings.

I think there are parallels between this film and Homecoming in the depiction of ground-level life in a world where superheroes exist. So they have the replica Batarangs and such to put to work, but they also are unburdened by everything that happened in the other Snyderverse films.

It is *always* great to see John Glover. And Thad’s origin story is kinda sympathetic. Imagine being told you suck by everyone around you then being whisked away by a wizard who also told you you suck. You’d take that pretty personally, wouldn’t you?

They found some real good kid actors, and the casting for the adult counterparts was perfect. Meagan Good was a pleasant surprise.",b94c5i

Billy Batson was a lost kid who grew up before his powers, Clark Kent always had his powers and part of his growing pains was understanding what he is. So when you're a kid who's had a rough life before receiving powers, what would you do? ""The right thing to do"" doesn't come naturally. But eventually, it will",b94c5i

I loved this movie. It was campy, self-aware, heartwarming, and hilarious. I adored the entire cast. Jack Dylan Grazer is an absolute treasure. I can’t believe how well Zachary Levi pulled off a fifteen year old in an adult body. I will admit that I still loved the original kids more than their “shazam” counterparts, and I’m not entirely sure why that is. I just found the foster home to be adorable. Even the parents are so likable.

I’m not surprised to learn the director has dabbled in horror films/shorts in the past. It makes sense. The creature design was terrifying, and some of the deaths were brutal. It really raised the stakes and added to the tension.

Lust: He goes to the strip club.

Sloth: He plays hookey from school, and forgets about the lunch.

Greed: He asks for money when taking selfies with his fans.

Pride: He demonstrates his powers to a crowd of people.

Envy: He wants a stable family life with his mom.

Zachary Levi is so charming as Shazam and I love the way Shazam and Freddy play off each other. I always enjoy a good Mark Strong villain. This one was a bit ham in certain scenes, but I think that it made those scenes even more funny, especially the “what?! I can’t hear you!” when he’s attempting to give his villainous monologue.

Was not expecting it to be as dark as it was between the seven deadly sins, Mark Strong killing his dad and brother, all of the stuff with Billy’s biological mother abandoning him; even the opening scene was unnerving. And of course, the lady who touched the door and disintegrated.

All of the kids getting superpowers at the end was a surprise, but it was pretty cool, I hope they do something good with that in the sequel. The scene where he reunites with his mom was gut-wrenching, even if I did see it coming.

My only significant complaints... The bit where Freddie accuses Billy of not being a real hero falls flat, considering that he was encouraging and benefiting from Billy's powers and adult form, and Billy did have a point about his request not only being selfish, but also defeating the point of a secret identity.

At first when I saw the trailers awhile back ago, I had no interest in it and originally I presumed the film would be a mess and a major flop, especially because even the costume in the trailers look eh (I know, never judge by the trailer!) And booooy, I was wrong. I am so glad I was wrong.

I saw the film in a group and we all like it'd. The film was beyond hilarious. The child actors were actually pretty good, including the lead, which left me surprised. The directing style was perfect and flowed well. Some directors have trouble with these films, but not this one.

The light hearted comedy was perfect and at times the film became perfectly emotional.

I seriously recommend this film, and I recommend going in a group, it's a *hilarious* must see, I'm serious this is a film you don't want to miss and is well worth the $ and I thought I was going to hate it!

Obviously it had some flaws like some CGI problems, but it was cinematic gold. Loved it. 9/10. DC has been killing it. I loved WW, thought I'd hate Aquaman, but loved that too and now this. It's a breathe of fresh air and much different!",b94c5i

I heard that the Marvel family was in this, so I was excited, but so far I liked the younger actors better than the adult ones. The bit of dialogue the adult actors had felt corny (though one could say that's intended, i just think it didn't work so well). Sivana had potential as a villain, but he just felt too cookie cutter and the seven deadly sins (imo) look very generic and didn't really do much. but i guess they were technically still in their gargoyle form? 

Overall, I loved about 3/4 of the movie. The stuff that dealt with family was heart-warming (and sad), the fight scenes i didn't really care for, and what's up with DC's obsession with slow-mo shots? There were quite a few of them in the final fight, and the shots didn't even look that interesting.

The cartoon, from the little they showed made Billy out to be the typical good kid..it was interesting to know/see that Billy wasn't necessarily true of heart when he was given the powers. The main villain was alright, but I did like having the seven deadly sins monsterfied...and the horror elements were a nice touch...was a little surprised how ""graphic"" some of the deaths were. Granted no blood but seemed to push what a PG13 could do. The assistant turning into ash looked great. Darla was absolutely adorable and reminded me of my god daughter.

It really warmed my heart when the kids in my theater walked out yelling ""Shazam!""

Both the leads for Billy are great, it was so much fun seeing Zachary Levi, felt nostalgic because of his Chuck days. I really want to see this character interact with Superman, that would make some fun scenes.

Watched it last night all I have to say is WOW.  I didn't expect to like this movie that much, but it was good. I've seen about 5 movies this year and I must admit I think this is the best one so far.  I didn't feel like I was watching the generic superhero movie. Let me say in my movie theater the crowd was really into it as the film was getting great reactions.

As far as the movie goes, did anyone get 90s/early 2000s movie vibes from this, but in a good way? But anyway the comedy was on point.  I'd only say 2-3 jokes didn't get reactions.  The story had good timing and I never felt like anything I was watching was really filler.  I have to say I loved the villain.  I loved when he just smacked his brother out of the window without a second thought. It was apparent that he was screwed up way before he met the Wizard, but the Wizard was the breaking point for him.  It was very realistic that he would have no problem killing a kid.  I enjoyed Billy's story though (heartbreaking when he finally met his Mom) I must admit I think the film was a lot better when Shazam came  out.  I also didn't see the family Shazams coming out I thought they'd go the route of having all of the kids create one Shazam (Flash Paradox version), but I must admit it was way more entertaining with the family of Shazams.  Anyways overall great film, I liked Aquaman but I thought this was by far better.

&#x200B;

PS: Was I the only one happy they had diversity in the film that made sense (the foster family)? I feel like so many movies are ""diverse"" because that's the expectation and many times it's forced.  I didn't even realize all of the different races until I was thinking back on the movie. ",b94c5i

I liked the music, and having John Glover was a nice surprise. I also lost it when Strong was giving a speech he wasn't heard. They did a good job of pacing, and making him not OP right off the bat.

The villain's origin story was quite punchy, making a kid feel special only to smack him down with a smugly stated ""unworthy"" after a very superficial first impression must have really stung, especially with all of his family already demeaning him.

Gotta say, not sure how to feel about the Shazam family though. Seems like a strange decision to introduce a whole orphanage worth of side characters, some of which barely had screen time, and give them the powers of Shazam. Kind of makes the powers of Shazam feel less unique and places future sequels in a weird place of having to juggle a bunch of characters or ignore them. I'm also curious about their capabilities. Does Billy have a greater potential in terms of power, or are there now a group of Superman tier characters in the DCU now?",b94c5i

This is the movie that DCEU needs.",b94c5i
ek90loq,"**SPOILER WARNING**

I loved the movie for the same reason I loved Spider-Verse. The heart of Shazam was Billy's relationship with his foster family and his friendship with Freddy. This movie was a perfect mix of humor and drama. The last superhero movie which made me laugh this much was Thor: Ragnarok but I have to admit that it's a running gag from start to finish and never takes itself seriously, which is completely fine because I loved it. But Shazam knows how to make you feel emotional, for Sivana, for Billy, and even for Freddy. I felt horrible when Billy realized that his mother had abandoned him. The references to other DCEU heroes were very naturally placed and it never felt like Shazam! was trying to set up another DCEU movie or was just another movie in the franchise. Another thing I loved was how Billy was a really flawed character. He's not your goody two shoes Peter Parker. He doesn't want to be a hero, and I really liked that how he was quite scared of Sivana during their first encounter. He didn't expect things to get this serious.

Also, that scene where they made fun of how Billy couldn't hear Sivana's evil villain speech since they're a mile apart was hilarious. Reminded me of how nobody in the first Avengers movie had earpieces.

>This scene was gold.  
>  
>**Batman Toy:** I'm Batman!  
>  
>**Billy:** Go get him Batman!

The only complaint I have is that the seven deadly sins and Sivana could've gotten better dialogue. Almost everything they say sounds like generic evil guy stuff which is a shame because the rest of the characters have great dialogue. Also I have to applaud Zachary Levi's acting here. I never felt that Billy and Captain Sparklefingers were different people. Zachary used to pick up exactly where Asher Angel left off in all the transformation scenes.

eka7211,"Finally a DC movie I truly loved lol

I was excited for this movie from the first trailer I saw. It seemed like it was just going to be a goofy origin story that focused on the friendship between Billy and Freddy (did not even know there were other foster kids in the house from the trailers), and somehow a supervillain finds them and threatens Shazam, as they usually always do in these types of origin stories. What I didn't expect was the mini origin story of the villain himself, which took up like 15 minutes at the beginning of the movie. I loved those scenes too. It was unexpectedly dark and not at all what I thought would have been in this goofy movie. In fact, many scenes took me by surprise. I was shocked that such violence was occurring on-screen. Like when he threw his brother out the window to die, or when we saw and heard every body hitting the bus's windshield as they fell.

And not only that, but I cared. I cared about Billy and Freddy and the other foster kids. I cared about their foster parents and what they must be going through not knowing what happened to Billy. I cared when the villain was holding the kids hostage. I really cared about everyone on screen.

And the ending where he transferred the powers of the other wizards to his siblings was cool too, because it subverted my expectations. I expected the hero to take down everyone on his own, because that's usually what happens. At the beginning of the movie, I remembered paying attention to the fact that there were 7 other thrones but only one wizard left. By the end of the movie, I forgot that that was a thing. But it was cool for the movie to bring it back and make them all Shazams. Totally subverted my expectations for how the climax was gonna go.

Also Zachary Levi as Shazam was amazing casting! The dude is a big man-kid already so it was a perfect role. And Jack Dylan Grazer has been a new fave since It, and he was totally great in this too. Also major props to Asher Angel, he really sold the role of Billy. Both kids just seemed like such real kids, it was great acting 

And the very last scene with Superman was amazing! My whole theatre was waited on bated breath to see who it was going to be (since Henry Cavill's been fired) and when they cut to the credits, some guy behind me was like 'oh come on!'. It was great lol

The only loose end or gripe I have with this movie was with Envy at the end. I kept waiting for him to come back and attack them because of the way they shot those last few scenes before the villain was taken down. They showed Envy rematerializing and then zoomed in on him watching Billy and the villain fly back to the carnival. It looked like he was about to fly after them. But then it's never brought up again. I even looked to make sure there were 7 statues at the end in the cave room and there were. Those few zoom ins on Envy watching them fly away made no sense. I have no idea why that was still in there, other than to perhaps show that he didn't actually die, but we could have interpreted that ourselves since we see the Sins always rematerialize. We didn't need a whole shot of Envy coming back if there was no payoff to that. But literally that's all. That's the only issue I had with the whole movie lol

Overall, so much fun! Theres a lot I could say/talk about from this movie but I don't have the patience or the coherence to type it all out lol. Warner Brothers must have been really sure of the movie to release it in theatres every Saturday for three weeks before the actual release date. And they were right. It's a great movie ",b94c5i

ekbd8cg,Was I just not noticing stuff or did Shazam never fire his electricity at the bad guys? That really confused me because it seemed like his most powerful ability but he never used it.,b94c5i
ekdo2xq,"I absolutely love this movie and I actually enjoyed it even more during my re-watch. Before I get to the good parts, I think some people are missing the point about Billy and Shazam seeming like 2 completely different people. Or at least this is how I see it. 

Billy is a troubled kid with a sense of abandonment and loneliness. Everyone he knows have told him that he wasn't loved and that his mother thought she was better off without him. He clings on to the hope of finding her because he wants to believe that's not true. But a part of him knows he's living in denial. Which is why he's closed off from everyone. To avoid being abandoned again. Life has been hard on him and forced him to toughen up.

But when he becomes Shazam, he doesn't have to be Billy anymore. In that moment, he can forget about his existential angst. Billy becoming Shazam is his form of escapism, much like how it's escapism for us to watch these movies or read these comics. When he's Shazam, he can be unburdened and truly be ""himself"" so to speak. 

As Billy, he has shown his lighter side. He's smart, witty, adventurous, curious, sarcastic and also a prankster and a trouble maker. He's clearly not as broody as he pretends to be.

The Sins were so creepy, right off the bat. But I liked how the movie takes  time not only to show us who Billy is, but also explore and establish Freddy and the other foster kids and their relationships with each other.

Darla is the heart of the family. Pure and innocent. Pedro is insecure, not just about his appearance, but also about his abilities in general. He finds it hard to fit in and we later get a hint that he's gay. He still tries to better himself everyday. Eugene is a happy go lucky kid who is probably the only one in the family who's not really bogged down by the fact that he's a foster kid. Mary is the responsible elder sister who deeply cares for her younger siblings and protects them. Freddy is the geekiest kid around the block but also very perceptive and mature where it matters most. He doesn't pity himself or feel sorry about his disability but he knows every around him does and hence treat him differently.

They could've probably explored the Sins more and sort of have the kids fight a specific Sin which are a reflection of their personal shortcomings. Like Pedro fighting Gluttony (not fat shaming) , Freddy fighting Lust, Eugene fighting Wrath, Mary fighting Pride etc. But it was still done really well done. The callback about Billy opening up his heart and discovering the Wizard meant he could share his powers with his brothers and sisters brought tears to my eges. Really really well done. And that moment was truly earned. It really comes full circle. 

I was surprised how good the fight scenes were considering the low budget. But it was somewhat noticeable in the final fight. You could feel the actors being dangled with wires and flung around when Shazam and Sivana face off in an airel battle. MoS obviously didn't have this problem because of its higher budget. The only thing I can nitpick about the movie tbh. I'm sure they could've cut out a lot of the joke's during the final fight and have the Shazam family  be serious, badass superheros but that would've been contradictory to the tone of the movie. I'm glad WB didn't do this just to appease to the CGI-battle loving folks out there.

And DC finally having that moment where the public cheers on its heroes was so amazing and uplifting. This is how Superman should be. 

10/10 would recommended.

Plus, he straight up caused a traffic accident that could've killed people and there are just no consequences to that.

ekfny4u,"I liked this better than Captain Marvel. I’m not saying CM is a bad film, but it felt too formulaic.

Anyways, I really liked the suit. The cape looks cool, though I prefer the version where it’s over his shoulder. The red was vibrant and the lightning bolt and gauntlets always being aglow was a nice touch. As for the character himself, I really wish we could have had him in Superman’s place in Justice League. Shazam and Flash could’ve had the friendship that Flash was trying to get from Cyborg and would have given that movie some actual magic.

I felt the film could have done more with Mark Strong, and the Sins were typical boring generic CGI villains. That said, Sivana and Shazam sharing powers didn’t feel as boring as the MCU does with their heroes and villains (Ant-Man and Yellowjacket, Doctor Strange and Kaecillius, etc.)

I did not see the Shazam family coming, so props for daring that in the initial film when I was anticipating it in the sequel. With the exception of Mary, the family felt like individual characters. It’s not that Mary felt bland, but I don’t think she was given enough personality to feel distinct other than her plot with going to college.

My biggest gripe with the film though is how Freddie acknowledges that villains will use the hero’s family as a weakness then nonchalantly calls Billy by his real name even in front of rolling cameras and around strangers. Not even mentioning how he didn’t think of the potential dangers of uploading videos showcasing all of Shazam’s abilities. The dumbass is letting villains go into every fight with a severe advantage not just against Shazam, but their whole family.",b94c5i

ekbtmas,"Did the lightning in the the Rock of Eternity scenes remind anyone else of Alex Ross' art? 

This is the second superhero movie to use the Ramones in their credits. It's funny how when the Ramones first came out, many people were afraid of punk rock and its influence on society. Especially on young people. How it was the end of civilization. How it was going to drive children to violence. Now when kids hear Ramones they are going to automatically think of superheroes. It's now, ""save the day,"" music. I think Joey would have gotten a kick out of that. And, personally, I love any chance to get kids into Ramones and punk rock in general. So, kids, here's the Ramones doing, [""I don't want to grow up,""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Tpu_XoNABA) which is actually a [Tom Waits' cover.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IaNaQHjIRE)

I liked how the movie skipped so many of the superhero origin cliches or turn them on their head. Billy didn't try to hide his new superpowers from his entire family throughout the movie. He quickly went to Freddie the moment he got them for help. Billy's mother didn't turn out to be dead, which is what I was afraid would happen. That way Billy would still be an orphan but mom wouldn't come across as awful. Nope. She was just awful. That scene when Billy finally found her was heartbreaking. Here is this kid who had spent a decade, 2/3 of his life having hope to be reunited with his mom. He carried that little compass with him everywhere he went. From home to home to home thinking that she would remember it. That it would touch her. But she didn't remember it at all. And when Billy went in for a hug, oh, God, she recoiled. Ouch, my heart. But what got me most about that scene was how Billy didn't become angry or bitter. He accepted it and immediately wanted to save Freddie and the others. That was the biggest difference Sivana, because the two were in the same boat, they were both rejected by their parents. Sivana became angry and bitter. He carried that with him for decades. And the moment he got magic, he went in for murderous revenge and spite. Billy had magic too. But he didn't hurt his mother when he found out the truth. His first thought was Freddie and the others. I think that was the pure heart the wizard was talking about. 

Speaking about Freddie and the others. I love that the foster parents were former foster kids too. That everyone in that house was in the same boat or had been there and wanted to make sure the kids had a safe and loving place to come home too. I like how the house looked a bit beat up and lived in. The wallpaper and paint was stripping in places. It wasn't all bright and sunny. But it did have this warmth. I loved all the kids. Freddie was really the heart of the movie. But Darla was so adorable. Yet I became sad at the thought of her when I realized that as cute and sweet as she was, she had either been born an orphan and no one had yet given her a permanent adoption or like Billy, her parents had abandoned her for some reason as a kid. Either way, I wanted to hug her. It made sense for her to cling onto Billy when they first met. She is of that age that she would give anything to have a permanent big brother. 

I didn't expect them to Shazam the rest of the kids. Usually, they would have saved that for the sequel. I'm glad I didn't have to wait. ",b94c5i

Overall the film is fun if a bit long - serious pacing issues dog the middle of the film - and is one I can easily recommend.

Question:  How exactly does the wizard Shazam pick his candidates?  He's after a champion with a pure soul yet he grabs a kid with serious emotional issues, is a basically a selfish little prick who even robs his crippled orphan roommate and definitely has problems with authority.

The humor and dialogue was 5th grade level funny, Levi over the top acting even as a kid was cringy at times.

I thought it was particularly well shot. The scene when Dr. Sivana opens the door and walks into the Lair was really cool as it transitioned - can't help but feel for the poor Doc that got roasted though.

---

The family dynamic was really great, especially Freddy and Billy. I've been waiting for a superhero nerd to get his chance to be a superhero. I thought it was great how they showed him testing his powers, I would probably be acting the same way at 14. The way the Wizard Shazam talked to Billy and mentioned the other wizards I quickly caught on with where they were going. I really enjoyed that it happened in this movie and they didn't play it out for a sequel. 

Did each of the kids get one of Billy's powers?
*Darla: Superspeed
*Freddy: Flight
*Eugene: Electricity
*Pedro: Super Strength
*Mary: Durability and Endurance? 

Also side note on Shazam Mary- not really sure why they decided to age superhero her up. The character is almost 18 and I though she did a good job acting. They should have just given her the suit and maybe some other striking feature, she could have done it herself.

Some parts the tone was a lot more... Mature I guess you could say than I had anticipated. The Sins creeped even me out so  I kinda feel for any kids who have nightmares tonight - and some people got outright murdered right on screen.

ekn2xl0,"My personal opinion of the movie was it was a positive ""okay"", but not one I see watching again.

The shame is that the *characters* and their relationships were fantastic. I think the actual *villain* portion of the movie, though, is where things fell apart for me.

I'd *MUCH* prefer if they'd have just focused entirely on the ""teenager trying to get used to having an adult's body"", not even focusing too much on the ""superhero"" stuff. Or just focus on more *regular* bad guys, like the bullies from high school doing some detective work and outing him as Shazam, and then regular thugs going after his family, or something like that.

I would say, I really didn't care for the whole scene of ""finding his mom"". Something felt ""missing"", like it was too *overly* trying to be a ""sad scene"" to the point it just didn't feel believable.",b94c5i
ekv7jrf,"I'd have preferred it if the second end credit scene was Freddy and co having lunch with Shazam and Superman. The cut on Freddy's reaction was a great way to end the movie - but I'd have liked to see a bit more after the fact.

Truly loved most of the movie, but the sins were way too silly/lame looking and the end fight was too long - enjoyed the humor sprinkled in, but flying and punching gets old after a while these days.

But WOW, great well-made movie and it seems like DC with Wonder Woman, Aquaman and now this that they are finding the right filmmakers to adapt their material.   
  
David Sandburg really nailed in the tone and his crew did great with the cinematography and VFX, making you really care for Billy and the other kids while making it clear there are stakes involved in between the lighthearted moments. I was actually impressed with the 7 Deadly Sins and the horror they showed which are from his past roots. Also appreciated they did not reveal the Shazamily in the trailers which made that great moment pay off.  
  
Zachary Levi was just great, I've been a fan since ""Chuck"" and happy he is starting to really break into lead roles. They casted the kids all well, each was their own character and their counterparts were perfect.  
  
Yeah one of my negatives was Dr. Sivana who didn't really have more depth but I am assuming he's merely the vessel and the 7 Deadly Sins were the real villain. Mark Strong played him the best he can but hopefully next movie with Master Mind they will give him more to do.  
  
Also want to call out Jack Dylan Grazer who was awesome as Freddie Freeman, he to me was really key to the story in terms of setting the rules and making you care about Billy and his sibilings.

Good humor that doesn't feel forced and doesn't undercut the emotional core of the film. It's not afraid to be dark and serious when it needs to be.

* Sucks that Shazam has the problem with never being able to say ""Shazam"" without transforming. Maybe they'll do away with it next film.

DC needed a win and they definitely got one with this. I'm actually gonna go ahead and say it's my favorite DC movie since Nolan's Batmen.

Billy Batson is a shy, kind of mean kid who dosen't express joy that much. Shazam is always cracking jokes, has a smile, and that just dosn't make sense. Also, the trailers advertise it like family fun so you bring your 8-year old child and then the boardroom scene happens.

1. Kid billy and adult billy have different personalities. I think asher angel portrays the rebellious teenager searching for his mom better, while zachary levi is too.. happy? Yeah anyway, them supposedly being the same person is not believable

2. Sivana saw the scientist touched the door and turned into dust so his reaction is immediately touching the door himself, real smart move /s

3. Why didnt shazam stop adult sivana from taking the eye? He was weak but he still had some magic in him and adult sivana was basically powerless before getting the eye

ek72pjs,"I got to early screen Shazam! and Upfront I actually really liked the film, despite me not being into superheroes.

But This movie is not generic super hero movie so that was nice. If you're a little tired of the MCU and DCU and whatever generic superhero film that's been constantly marketed to you, this isn't one of them. So that's a plus.

Though the setup sequence for the film is really weird and a bit bait and switchy, but then again a lot of superhero movies tend to be pretty weird so this isn't all too unusual.

The humour in the film is actually really hilarious. It's on point the entire film which is great. None of the jokes and gags in the film fall flat or feel out of place. The humor alone is worth watching this film if you're a fan of comedy, because this movie had the theater laughing pretty good.

There's plenty of jokes for adults, and kids which is really nice. 

The film never has a boring moment in it, and while it does have some emotional downtime to it, it pulls a twist in the film that is positive and actually had the theater clapping.  It's pretty wholesome without being cheezey, and doesn't pull too many generic clichés to uphold it's story. 

I obviously don't want to spoil anything so I'm going to leave at that.
 
I tend to rate films more on a basis of fun, and entertainment rather than a measure of quality, and Shazam! was actually quite fun.

If you're looking for a film to take your kids too for a weekend, this is a really good candidate, and I think a better choice than How to Train Your Dragon 3. The movie is fairly clean humor as well, so no big worries about gutter level humor.

Note: There is an in-credit's plot setup, but the credits are pretty fun and amusing too, so it's worth watching them.

The Runtime of the movie, by the way, its a little over 2 hours, so it's kind of long. It's longer than I expected, and may be a bit long for for kids to sit through.

I'm giving Shazam! an 8 out of 10. Very fun and I think worth a movie ticket, especially for parents wanting to see a movie with their kids.",b94c5i

I really enjoyed it! The humor was on point nearly all of the time, there were a lot of great, sweet heartfelt moments too that I really liked, and I really came to like the characters too.

The biggest negative for me was the villain in general (he was kind of just...a one note, generic ""I am evil!!!!!"" villain and that was it) and uhh, the use of horror elements? Like, I get that the director comes from horror movies, but in a movie that is otherwise really sweet and fun, some of the death scenes that came about by the villain were a little too brutal for my tastes, and in general it kind of just felt jarring in comparison to how the rest of the movie is. 

Some other negatives was that the final battle felt a little too long also (but there were still some great moments in it). Also, not really a negative but just a thing to point out I guess, I got a lot of Sam Raimi Spider-Man vibes from this movie, which well, is also a superhero movie coming from a mostly horror director, so I guess it makes sense.

I'm also really glad that they managed to fully split time between Levi and Asher as I feel that both were equally fantastic in their roles.  I know the villain was pretty 1D, but honestly I'm kind of glad.  This movie was really about family, and the villain was just a plot device to give Billy something to tangibly conquer and display his unity with and love for his new siblings.  Credit to Mark though, he's a professional through and through and he gave us a pretty decent performance for an otherwise flat character.

There were a few noticeable flaws and it did have some pacing issues between him getting his powers and the first confrontation with Dr. Sivana, but I think it was a fantastic movie honestly and well worth the money.

Loved: 

When Billy looked at the subway map and outside to the Rock of Eternity.

Freddy sucks at coming up with superhero names as much as Billy does for coming up with Comebacks 

The go pro on Freddy's head to record the truck destruction. Reminded me of a more childish version of the truck in Man of Steel. 

The actor playing Feddy, Jack Dylan Grazer  looked so familiar it was bugging me throughout the film as why he did. Than when he got his alter ego and it was played by Adam Brody ([Seth](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/13/SethCohen.jpg)) from the OC it became obvious. Seth character from The OC was similar too. 

The Big reference piano

Love that movies are embracing the cheeseniss of the comics costumes. 

Both times they subverted the bad guy evil monologue. Once when the kids ask what Dr.  Sivana and he was about to say what he wants and than when during the fight where he was and it was played for jokes that he couldn't hear him 

Mark Strong great as always but guess he's the bad guy again after Kingsman subverted the expectation of him always being the bad guy 

Nitpick:

 Freddy sits down and starts talking about superheroes and what superpower invisibility or flight he was carrying a full lunch tray and Billy gets up and throws his away. Freddy didn't eat and just threw away his full lunch tray. 

That poor guys phone that got overloaded and so much property damage. Surprised there wasn't an attempt to question Shazam for trying to Rob an ATM and how much dough did they get for going street performances to afford all those electronics  lol makes one understand why so many people dress up as fake superheroes or mascots in like new York or San Fran. The foster parents never noticed a hole in their house and ceiling. Destroying part of the skyscraper by failing to jump over. Shocking the soda machine and making a hole in the bathroom. Knocked out a transformer. Destroyed a bus and part of the highway. 

Why does the boardroom have a locked button what would it ever be used for to seal people in? 

I still liked Aquaman better but I did love this film but how did they know Aquaman commands aquatic animals if the Atlantians existence is still mostly hidden. Unless Freddy was such a superhero fanatic he read all fan theories and stuff so that's probably how. Also pretty much it was to be a throwaway to poke fun of it's rival so not really meant to be taken seriously so fun.

The door after Dr. sivana created to the Rock of Eternity where the Psychologist touched and than disintegrated. Wish they did more with the door being dangerous except for the door knob.

Also the amount of times Freddy and Billy were arguing in public in full view of cameras seemed pretty easy for any villain to find out who he really is or get close to him.

I know they made it more of a personal story and less of a destroy the world type which would probably make Superman or Wonder Woman come to help but Dr. sivana and the seven evils seemed pretty weak for having the power to once almost destroying the world until stopped by Shazam and his brother and sisters. Though gr8anted the seven sins did get the upper hands over the new champions versions still they went much smaller than Aquaman did.

Wish they played more on the seven deadly sins with Shazam taunting envy out or Dr. sivana with greed for his father. Bit disappointed on that.

Also seems like philadelphia police and news don't have any news or attempts to find a missing psychologist, a dead board of directors and CEO of an obviously rich company. Plus two bodies thrown out of a building must have landed somewhere unless the police lunch got stolen than they seem able to track down their suspect

Wish they got Henry Cavill for Superman or should have just changed it to Wonder Woman instead. 

Also poor Djimon Hounsou I knew Shazam would probably die from the no magic storyline they had in the comics but didn't expect him to die again so early. He really should be taking over for Sean Bean for if he's in it he's probably gonna die. He has died twice now in the DCEU (Fisher King in Aquaman) and once in MCU it's time for marvel to recast him to even the score. Dies in Furious 7, Aquaman, Shazam, Guardians of the Galaxy, Push, eragon, I forgot if he died in Seventh Son. Glad to see him twice this year in a DCEU and MCU film. Well also only 4 months ago in Aquaman too.

Who would have thought we would get two captain marvel films in the same year. Superhero movies really came far since the beginning . Also Djimon Hounsou was in both ",b94c5i

There was a couple people who brought their 8 or 9 year old kids to the movie.  The Spiderman trailer ends with ""dickwad"" as the punch line, to which one kid behind me asks very loudly ""Daddy what's a dickwad"".  It was great everybody in the theater was laughing.  About a third of the way though the movie there was a scene where a demon rips a guy's head off and throws him through the window of a tall building.  Same kid was crying through that scene.  It might be a bit intense for someone that young, which is odd cause the rest of the movie has the villains are more goofy.",b94c5i

Really struggling to understand 92% on RT for this one.

ery44jy,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. This feels like a 1990s Disney or Nickelodeon made-for-TV movie.  Tragic in just about every way. Why was 90% of the movie just Billy/Shazam running away from the villain? Even at the end in the cheezy power rangers assemble scene most of the ""fighting"" was just the different coloured Shazams running away from the seven sins. 

I can't really express how bad this movie was. When you go back and watch a 1980s kids movie you cringe because it's just so awful. We turned a corner with Batman Begins/TDK, Nolan made superhero movies mean something. Seems we've come full circle now. Would anyone here actually say this movie would look out of place if you put on Nickelodean in the mid 1990s?",b94c5i
ek5rwt9,"I thought it was really weird that as Captain Marvel he was wayyyyy less serious than when he was a kid. It’s like the kid was playing a responsible adult, and Levi was playing a screw around kid. It was hard to see them as the same character. Otherwise it was pretty good",b94c5i

ek5eqho,"I’m a huge comic book fan. Yet, I’ve been feeling superhero film fatigue for quite sometime. Infinity war was okay, aquaman didn’t wow me, and captain marvel felt like something we’ve seen before. 
Yet, Shazam was somewhat refreshing. It feels like a family drama first, then a superhero film second. It pokes fun not only at the superheroes but the genre itself. It allows for children to resonate with the characters because they see that the character is a kid (despite appearing as an adult) It blends the humor, drama and horror well. 
The first 15 minutes are clunky and awkward but it benefits the film later. Once Levi shows up, the film exceeds expectations. 

There’s an amazing family element present in the film. I believe I read that the screenplay writer and David F. Sandberg first approached the script as a family drama to see if it works, rather than a superhero film. 

Can we appreciate that we have an entertaining third arc as well? I’m glad it’s not another huge CGI battle where we can distinguish what is going on.

I do agree with some that there is a personality imbalance between billy and Shazam. It sometimes felt like they were playing the same core person. 

I managed to watch the film a couple of weeks ago during the Fandango event. I’m excited to see it again this weekend. 

Edit: I know the film follows some of the common tropes but there are other parts to it that made me feel it’s refreshing for the genre.",b94c5i

ekdegas,"It was quite good and I enjoyed it! It's certainly refreshing for a super hero movie, and tastefully modern. I wouldn't call it life-changing, it's not incredible, but it does its job well to entertain. It focuses on the right content while purposefully ignoring things that would raise a few eyebrows. The bridge got destroyed, people's lives were put at risk, and Shazam isn't questioned by the authorities? A hole in the ceiling isn't explained? He took money from an ATM and, once again, authorities didn't question him? Focus, guys. It's a super hero movie about the personal growth of Billy as he learns to move on from a troubled past, to mature, and to accept and protect a loving family. Leave the super serious stuff to the edgy Joker, Batman, or Superman movies.

It felt like Goonies from the point they all met at the house with the villain, which is by and far much more of a Spielberg -esque moment than RPO was in its entirety.

Most of the main characters had appropriate arcs, though Mary's college arc didn't seem to go anywhere. I get that she had that talk with Shazam in order to emphasize her priority for her family while exploring Shazam's disconnectedness, but it's never determined whether she goes to college or not and it feels a bit unsatisfying. It could have been worth completing that just to bring home the idea that no matter where she goes, she'll always be connected to her family. Just a thought. Pedro didn't do much, either, if I recall correctly. Darla's arc was cute. Eugene's arc was useful to the plot moving forward.

I feel that the movie dragged a bit during the first fight between Shazam and the villain by the time it got to the mall and a bit during the carnival scene, but otherwise, the pacing was decent. Though, some of the rules laid out by the movie didn't make too much sense.. for example, how come he cannot attack the Sin at the carnival who kept turning into fog, but his family could take on them one on one without them.. clouding out, so to speak? Though, I don't recall at any point that he was able to fight any of the sins, save for his lightning bolt during the transformation. Maybe the other Shazams can fight them because they need something to fight..? I'm just glad it wasn't another army of gray cgi bugs or monsters... oh, wait...

The Shazams being heroic at the carnival should have focused on completing some arcs. Granted, Pedro had no arc, but why are we exploring his ability to ""do it"" by holding the ferris wheel together when he never could not ""do it"" to begin with? Make it satisfying. Super Darla acting like little Darla was charming and fun, which is all it needed to be. Super Freddy was a satisfying arc and made you care. Super Eugene was for the references.

The movie relied on its humor quite a lot, and a lot of the jokes landed pretty well. Perhaps the only joke that felt cheap was being unable to hear the villain. I get it, but let Deadpool do the fourth walling so I can not watch those movies and enjoy this one.

The movie was maybe 10-15 minutes longer than it needed to be, but it was pretty good, better than most other DC movies released this decade, and I recommend it over Captain Marvel.",b94c5i

enh6pzb,"Below average for me.

I'd like to at least say that it comes off better in writing but I have a huge problem with Billy as a character. He was just a little shit. Forget all of human civilization for the past however many thousand years, the kid next to him, Freddy, was easily a more deserving candidate to be Shazam. Worst thing of all was that they made him get rejected by his birth mother before he had to make any decision to choose between finding his mom ASAP and helping back his new family. He had no redemption and went back to his new family only because he got abandoned not because he wanted to at all. I was willing to be lax on him in the beginning 'cause-y'know, he's an orphan, give him a break for acting out, but things just kept piling on and on and on. Call me a sourpuss, but I *really* don't think they handled balancing comedy and seriousness well in the overall tone of the movie. Him giving Mary the shittiest advice ever and ""humorously"" being like, ""Really? What else do you want me to do?"" to those people about to die who already fell \~50 ft from one end of the bus into glass really rubbed me the wrong way.

Villain's backstory was pretty solid and the whole family motif contrast between him and Billy had a lot of potential, but once we got to the present timeline the dude just came off as a generic bad guy with a one-track mind. Wish the Sins were more threatening, seems like they are suppose to rival the gods that Shazam gets his power from so any one should be pretty damn fearsome. Was pretty surprised at how much gore they depicted in the scene where he killed his family seeing as how this is the most kids-oriented superhero film of them all but can't say I didn't like that. In the end though, you just got them running around a carnival harassing normal people like a rowdy dog off its leash. One of them literally stopped attacking one of the Shazam Fam peeps mid-battle just to waltz over to the ferris wheel and knock it down-for what? Random forced suspense?

Shazam Family was a signature DCEU jumping the shark move, so much potential for that to be a kick-ass development in a future movie once it's earned but comes off as rushed and shoehorned when done now. Film had a decent light-hearted feel at the beginning but it consistently got cornier and cornier, and the dialogue from the family while they were fighting the Sins was the pinnacle, like Power Rangers-level cringe.

All in all, Zachary Levi and Billy's actor do a decent job but don't think any of the supporting cast was that good. Recognize a decent amount of the actors from TV shows I watch; and while I think they're fine in those, just don't think they're capable of pulling off supporting cast in a blockbuster movie like this. Weren't any particularly cool or creative fight scenes, which is really the only thing I would demand from a superhero movie. Think him jumping off the roof to transform and some shots in the cave/lair were the only visually impressive shots. Don't think I'd bother watching a sequel unless I eventually felt forced to just to be caught up to the DCEU as a whole to watch some future Justice League movie or something (am a fan of Aquaman).

Lastly, I'm really, really confused why Superman's suit looks so bad, like a plastic figure or wax model. Thought that it was a joke at first and Billy just got a random person on the street to impersonate him or something. Looked it up online after the movie and apparently it was supposed to be a legit cameo but I still don't know for sure to be honest.",b94c5i

ek5t6ad,"This has happened with a good handful of movies and it always bugs me, it's almost like screen writers forget to count backwards when it comes to young parents / teen parents kind of backstories.

If I'm remembering correctly Billy's mom said she was 17 when she abandoned him. But the kid we see in the flashback is like what 3, 4 maybe 5 tops? So is the movie implying she had him at 12 minimum? And the fact the dad is in jail, can we suspect something dark like he was much older than her? And he's in jail for knocking her up? It's never said why he's in jail. But the movie also said she went back to her maiden name, so that means that Batson is the father's name. So does this also imply some kind of marriage between two under 18 teenagers or one teenager and an older man before he was arrested?

This also may very well be the most realistic superhero movie I've ever seen: no pathetic 5 minute dialogues before killing villain, real life problems any of us could've dealt with (much like spiderman), the hero is actually a KID (we all were kids at some point), all of that ties up perfectly. Overall it was a very fun 2 hour ride, which I would recommend to literally anyone, even families with kids (movie is pretty much family centered).

My only real complaints would be the sudden, jarring tonal shifts.  
I get that DC is trying to be less serious and grim, but a lot of the scenes with Sivana felt like they were *way* too dark considering the overall tone for the rest of the movie.   
The scene with Sivana's assistant disintegrating and the scene with Sivana and the sins murdering his father/the entire board of directors (seriously it felt like it strayed into Cabin in the Woods-esque territory for a second there) felt like overkill.

Same goes for Billy's mom, although they correct it a little bit at the end.  Still, I think they could've handled giving him away better so that it didn't feel so ridiculous.  It didn't help that the actress wasn't good.](#spoiler)

[And I think others have touched on the weakness of the family members' introductions.  It almost felt like the story setups in a Disney Channel show, more than a blockbuster movie.  Sorry to make this comparison, but I think those are the elements the average Marvel movie handles much better.](#spoiler)

[On the final carnival fight, it just wasn't as interesting as it should've been and it didn't make sense in places.  The slow motion was part of the problem - it's really unnecessary to do it so often.  It also didn't fit that the siblings were strong enough to fight back against the Sins but Billy couldn't earlier.  The power levels never felt very consistent, and the Sins didn't feel very unique, aside from flying vs non-flying](#spoiler)

I'd give it like an 8/10.",b94c5i

Meagan Good killed it as Darla's powered up form, she was great. All in all it was a great movie and one of the better ones. The best comparison is to Spider-Man Homecoming and in that regard, I think Shazam was better and accomplished what it set out to do.

ekjn3hm,"My quick, hot take, review:

This is hands down, IMO, the darkest movie DC has put out since The Watchmen. Which created this very interesting dichotomy; where it had these dark themes, moments, visuals, juxtaposed to these lighter, humorous and visceral moments.

So while it felt to me like the darkest movie for DC since The Watchmen, it had this spirit that felt very reminiscent of Donner's original Superman: The Movie.

Just a real treat of a movie, and felt different from recent big budget superhero movies from the past five years or so. Great achievement all around, and can't wait for the sequel.",b94c5i

- Meet his mom was fucked up

I would give it a C-",b94c5i
ek5xcec,"I liked the movie. I didn’t love it though. But I liked it enough to be hopeful for a sequel that can really take off, hopefully featuring Black Adam.

What works really works. The humor, the banter between Freddy and Billy/Zach, Zach as Shazam. It has heart and it was nice seeing a hero movie set in rust belt / middle class snowy America for a change. The first two acts of the movie has an indie vibe it, and it’s wonderful. The robbery scenes, both of them, them trying to figure out his powers, then later trying to test them. All great.

The 3rd act though, oof. I think it was anti climactic and overall the action wasn’t very good. The lightning and all was well done, but there really wasn’t enough of it, and especially the final fight was anti climactic. It was just weirdly devoid of any tension. I get making it smaller scale to fit the world of the kids, but the fairgrounds set-piece and scene was just really underwhelming I thought. But I can forgive it because the movie wasn’t so much about that as it was about Shazam/Billy figuring out who he is and where he belongs. I just wish he’d figured that out without turning his foster siblings into the Shazam family. It kind of seems like he only cared about them arbitrarily and until they got powers. But that coincides of course with him learning his mom doesn’t want him and that they’re all he’s got, but it didn’t seem so organic to me in a way. I think if there was a little bit of passage of time between his encounter with his mom and the final action stretch they could have hammered home that he was finally committed to his “real” family before the climax, like him coming back to an empty house, looking fo them but not finding them or something like that. I also must be one of the few who didn’t like they introduced the Shazam family already. It kind of made Billy/Shazam feel less special in a way, but okay, they weren’t in it much, fine. But I wish he’d overcome all these things on his own, maybe with help from his foster siblings without powers, so his growth as a hero wouldn’t hinge so much on the other kids gaining powers. Oh well I can live with it.

Another weird thing was how different Billy seemed from Shazam. I’d expect them to behave more similarly but oh well, you might be able to attribute that to the confidence gained from being in a superhero’s body. But the Freddy/Blue Shazam was much more aligned in this manner.

Finally, the Superman cameo was awkward as hell. If you’re gonna do it but can’t land Cavill, best to just show him from the back then with the cape and then the reaction of all the kids, or not at all. That body clearly wasn’t Cavill and the way the cropped the head was so jarring. 

7/10 for me.

I’d be interested in seeing how this fares in Europe as I felt this was really a *very specifically american* movie.",b94c5i
ek7uq0y,"I don't see anyone discussing this, but does it make sense for Shazam to be as dorky and immature as he was?

There were a couple of minor issues with it, mainly that it sort of fails to achieve an inspiring hero vibe. >!Billy goes through the whole arc of average joe gifted with powers through to realising the responsibility of the powers and in the end truly become ""The Champion"" yet somehow the film falls short of capturing that poignancy of that journey and becoming a ""hero"". Family is also a central theme throughout the film as Billy is torn between finding his biological family and accepting the foster family that are trying to welcome him into their lot, and the conclusion to that arc is clunkily resolved and moved past. !<It felt as if any somber moments were intentionally rushed through to keep the tone fun and light hearted.

I'm completely down for a sequel featuring Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil! ",b94c5i
ekd17yq,"What a great flick. I watched it a second time today with a friend. I've never seen a movie really tackle foster care and wasn't expecting that in a super hero film. Finding out you may not be wanted is something I'm sure a few kids go through out there. To me, that seems more devastating than batman's dead yet loving parents.

Mary crying because she got into her dream school and having a hard time leaving everything behind seemed relatable to me. The unknown has always been scary.

Doctor Sivana's story was a tragedy. Sure we saw the fight with envy at the end, but it was interesting seeing his start. At his heart, he was just a kid like Billy but without a loving family when Billy found a good family. It really shows how much development has an impact on a child's life. 

Also I just love Mark Strong. His character didn't pull any punches. The entire board of directors were violently murdered. I love that cheesy setup of the air rifle firing at his eye in slowmo and he just catches it effortlessly at the end of buildup. That cinematography was awesome.

I didn't expect any of that from a movie full of great comedy and action, and yet here we are. The ""big"" and ""tawky tawny"" nods were really great. I was not expecting the Shazam family first movie and coud not have been happier with their execution. One of the few 3rd acts that holds up well. Great script, great story, great effects, even a great soundtrack. For such a cringey comic book, probably the first movie I saw this year that didnt make me cringe at any point.

ekwvu7g,"These are fresh thoughts… very fresh thoughts. I left the theater about an hour and a half ago. Ok, enough fluff, let’s get into it.

The GREAT:

Jokes- Wow. I really loved the comedic aspect of the film. The jokes never seemed forced and were genuinely very funny. Lots of jokes went over very well with the audience, including myself. A subtle reference here or there about being a teenager or something as blunt as the disabled foster kid claiming that he “has it the best”. I absolutely love how instead of just having some robbery, it comes during the time when the two boys are trying to buy beer with Billy’s newfound identity. The superhero testing was awesome and I wish that hadn’t just grazed over it as they did in the film. One last part, swearing Santa. LOVE IT. I would have to say the part where the movie shines the most is in its humor.

Acting- The acting was OUTSTANDING. The chemistry on screen was awesome to see play out and the fact that Zachary Levi did such an amazing job of really portraying how a teenager would act in that situation was really cool to see. Asher Angel and Jack Dylan Grazer also do a great job. You can really see the bond they form and how terrible it is to watch when they go through their rough patches. I really love how unique each character is from one another based on their acting. You can tell the enthusiastic ones, like Darla (Faithe Herman) and Eugene (Ian Chen) from the ones who are more laid back and even quiet like Mary (Grace Fulton) and Pedro (Jovan Armand). I love that dynamic and it makes it so much easier to distinguish and really learn about each character (which I will touch on later).

CGI (?)- From the limited amount of flying around and moments where you would look for CGI, everything looked great. The seven sins looked photorealistic, which had to have been tough based on the fact that they arise from smoke. The lightning that came out of Shazam’s fingers looked flawless, and even when there were those moments where he was being thrown around and whatnot, it was not easy to tell it was CGI. Obviously me, being the movie nerd I am was looking for it, and really found no complaints so good on DC, especially after rebounding from some poor CGI in their last few films (Steppenwolf OML). As compared to the CGI in Captain Marvel($152 million budget) as compared to that of Shazam! ($85 million budget) I’m going to have to give the upper hand to Shazam! Here. Captain Marvel had some glaring flaws in that department even with the huge budget (granted Marvel Studios is most definitely going in much harder with CGI for Avengers: Endgame).

Costume- Ok I’ll keep this short. Love the Shazam costume. All 6 of them to be exact. Love the glow given off by the bolt. That’s all.

Character development- I know, I know, I’m handing out greats all around, and it’s somewhat unusual due to the fact that I am a huge critic of superhero movies, but I promise this is the last one. The character arcs for all of the main characters (and even the smaller ones) were awesome. I felt like I really knew each of their stories and why they acted how they did. The villain (Dr. Sivana, played by Mark Strong) had his motivations established literally in minute number one, and Billy’s inner demons about his mom were set up equally as well and early. I really liked how each character wasn’t over or under developed. Every character was given just the right amount of background info to really establish a connection with the audience. For example, we know Freddy is disabled, but we don’t hear about how or when or any of that stuff because it simply doesn’t matter. We can tell Pedro is quiet, but never given a reason or a backstory, because we don't need it. I could go on and on about how well they slip in or leave out fluff, but then this would be already way too long (on top of how it is already way too long). Overall, loved the character development.

The GOOD:

Pacing- Now here’s something I ripped Captain Marvel on heavy because the pacing was terrible. DC got it right. The only issue I has was with the final fight, it was stretched a tiny bit long, but I still was engaged the whole time. Nothing that really made me groan. Basically, we were given everything we needed in a short and concise way that kept the audience involved, enough said.

Setting- Big city, high school, carnival, wizard castle. Pretty fun playground to go to work with. They did a really good job with it. Not much beyond that.

The OK:

Wait, wait, wait, where’s the BAD?? To that I answer, I didn’t find anything to be glaringly bad. I know it ounds ridiculous, but I really didn’t see anything that made me cringe. Good on DC, nice rebound from Aquatrash.

Multiple Shazams!- Ok I know I might get ripped apart for this, but just hear me out. I get it, they are a family, but this is Billy’s fight. He was clearly not overmatched as shown by his ability to fight on his own until he turned over the staff. I’m aware and I understand that they wouldn’t just want 5 extras standing there being damsels in distress. I would have prefered to see him win the fight on his own and then after his victory, triumph with his newfound family over some post battle superheroing. I also wouldn’t have minded a super short montage of them working together.

Final Analysis:

We finally made it! Ok I’ll make this brief. I really enjoyed this movie and it was probably the second best superhero film this year (behind Into the Spider-Verse and yes I know it came out in 2018 just give it to me). There were no glaring flaws and I really loved a lot of aspects of the movie. Drum roll…. 8.5/10.",b94c5i

ek647zf,"The movie was quite good, I'd say it's the second best movie of this universe behind Man of Steel (sue me). The last 20 minutes or so felt like a bit of a drag though, like I was quite unengaged by the non-stop action. Seeing Shazam figuring out his powers and all the family stuff was *so* much more fun than seeing some cgi demons or a flying man with a glowing eye. I'd say the really good parts of the movie was like an 8.5/10 or something like that while the worse parts were maybe a 6. 

* Dr. Sivana was nothing special, he was servicable with an awesome scene of him using his powers out in the world for the first time (him throwing out his brother from the 50th floor). Other than that I'm probably going to forget him in a couple of weeks.

* The opening scene in the car was really good too, /u/dauid really got me with that bait of them being safe. Loved the music choice in that scene too. 

* Zachary Levi killed it in the role and some of the kids were really impressive too. I wonder how they'll do with the sequels? I guess they'll have to recast some of the kids if they ever get to a third movie because I feel like Asher Angel has got 1 more in him at the most. 

* Does Shazam/Billy transform whenever he says Shazam or does he have to have intent to transform when saying it? Because if he transforms whenever he says it it would be very impractical to have that as your superhero name since whenever someone asks you what your name is you can't really answer. 

* How come the magic thingy that was to choose a champion with a pure heart didn't choose Superman? Is it racist against aliens? Surely Barry Allen would've been good hearted enough too.

* I don't know how well known David's short animation [All Quiet Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83rq4G569EM) is but I was very surprised to see that playing in the mall scene and that really put a smile on my face.

There were definitely some plot contrivances, but nothing that dragged the movie down for me. I was surprised by how dark some moments were - it had some legitimately disturbing stuff. But it played that contrast well with the silly humor, and it took things serious when it needed to. I like the formulation of the main villain - it's not exactly S tier but you at least had a good understanding of his backstory and motivations, as opposed to something like Yellowjacket from Ant-Man. It had a solidly structured story that played out its beats, with a fun (if dumb) ending and a good sense of personality, so on a personal level I would call this a win for DC. If they can keep that up I expect great things in the future, which would be very nice to see. ",b94c5i

I liked: 


How fun the movie was. I was laughing out loud at several points in the movie. 

Shazamly. I've never followed Shazam. I didnt know there was a family! I frikkin loved it!


How the actually developed Shazamly in a nice way. No hamfisted horseshit here.

Diversity


A good father figure that was (maybe overly good but still) human and believable. 


A realistic abandonment story 


Mark Strong. He was good.



What I didnt like:

The CGI seemed off at times. 


The tangible form of the sins was a bit - cartoonish. 


The sins didnt seem to have different personalities. The threat they posed was never explained. Maybe thats good? I'm not sure at this point. 


The neverending aerial fights. We need an update on how aerial fights are coregraphed because none of them seem interesting or even exciting. In shazam, they've interspersed the aerial combat with civilian POVs and attempted attacks on civilians and infrastructure so you dont notice it, but it does leave you unsatisfied. 


Djimon Honsue. The exaggerated fury didnt work.

ek5ho6m,"  

Wow, I feel like I am in crazy town. I really wanted to like this movie and I enjoyed the trailers, but both myself and my buddy who saw it tonight thought it was horrible. It had its funny parts and the main character was pretty good, but it was just so cliché and ridiculous.

I have no issues watching a movie and bringing myself into an imaginary world where kids can magically transform into super heroes. That doesn’t bother me at all, but I get offended by lazy writing and when the basic premise of the movie is so lazy and unrealistic it is laughable. Like the fact that Billy’s mom, just walks away from him as a child, and somehow the police, child services, the government, just have no idea what happened to her. Poof she is gone and can never be found. “Sorry Billy, I looked everywhere for 10 minutes and couldn’t find your mom, I guess you will be in foster care for the rest of your life.” What? Like they really couldn’t find his mom, or tell him anything, or know what happened to her? Really? All we needed was one scene where she gives up her rights as a parent or something. Also, when he finds her, she tells him that she was a 17 year old single mom, but the kid in the flashback is like 5-7 years old, meaning she would have been like 12 years old when she gave birth to him. It makes no sense.

From there we get the immediate cliché of Billy being the “rebellious foster child” who is always running away yet somehow ends up in an amazing foster house with amazing well behaved kids in a house that is a mansion that probably costs almost a million dollars, but we put some trash on the patio and a hole in the wall so it’s a little junky now. 

Then, we get to the now grown up bad guy, who has held his grudge for 40 years, who is somehow rich enough to run these crazy experiments, and then all of a sudden surprised doctor lady is murdered by a magic door, followed up by the next 30 minutes where pretty freaky looking pixelated CGI monsters brutally murder people including eating one guys head off center screen. The movie started out pretty dark with the car crash and the violence, I was actually surprised, and I thought that was going to be the tone of the whole movie, but of course it wasn’t. We go from murdering freaky monsters, to the rest of the movie being goofy and silly, not to mention after that point the monsters don’t seem to kill a single person, even when they get their hands on someone, they just kind of chase people and dangle them from high places. It makes no sense at all.

Can we please also mention how god awful DC is at CGI in its movies. It obviously is by choice because when they want to, the CGI can look amazing. Between Superman’s face and lip, Nichole Kidman’s messed up face in Aquaman, the end fight scene in Wonder Women, and now this garbage, I don’t understand how no one ever mentions these problems. It is completely unacceptable to release a major blockbuster movie with this bad of CGI. The 7 sins in this movie were downright awful and it got progressively worse as the movie went on. There was a scene in the middle of the movie where the 7 sins are surrounding the good guys, and for a two second shot it looked like youtube lost its connection and it went down to 144p, and I have no idea how no one hasn’t mentioned it at all.

There is just so many issues I had with this movie, and I tried really hard to like it. I really did enjoy the two young kids learning about his powers and making the videos, but it never went anywhere. We never see him learn anything about his powers, or grow as a hero, we just see him learn about family, which is nice, but that doesn’t make it a super hero movie. There were so many interesting things we could of learned about his lore, or about him coming to grip with his powers and getting serious, but no, the entire movie becomes a joke fest and we never even get one serious scene with the hero. I was a little surprised by the kids turning into heroes too, but it was easy to see early on in the movie when they line up all the kids in front of the empty chairs in the lair, but it was pretty unnecessary and distracting. They really don’t do anything in the movie and they never even fight with the 7 sins, they only really got captured by them and then the good guy gets the eye and all the evil goes away. We never see the hero take anything seriously or grow as a hero. Personally, I would have thought it would have been better if he finally discovers about his powers and saves his family and we get one serious scene with him discovering his hidden potential, then at the very end he discovers about the 6 heroes and we see the family grab the staff and cut to black….

God, I keep thinking of more awful things, but the score in this movie was so underwhelming and the over use of bullet time was ridiculous. Every single shot involving a hero just went to slow motion for everything they did, not to mention that that the only skill Billy mastered in the whole movie was transforming into a kid, running away a bit, and transforming back. That is all he does the entire movie. They even make a huge deal about his lightening hands, and I don’t think in the entire movie he ever used that power during a fight, not once.

I am sorry, that is all I have now. I am just amazed to come home and find that everyone likes this movie and I haven’t read a single critically thing about it…Please tell me how wrong I am…",b94c5i
ekjszyj,"Definitely think it was a fun movie, but it spent so much time dawdling with them running away from the big bad, that I kept thinking ""**Surely** they'll stand and fight him now!""

&#x200B;

But then he runs, and he gets found, and runs, and his family is caught, runs, family helps, runs, and finally fights at the carnival. There was so much time for them just dicking about, that I wish they'd just gone right to the fighting, since the only thing of value we learned during that, was he can open a door to the ""lair"" and that the Sins were his source of power.

&#x200B;

But Chuck (I won't ever call him anything but Chuck, sorry not sorry) was brilliant, he truly was able to act like a kid that turned into a superhero. The conflict between Billy and Freddy felt very sudden and a bit forced as well, but all in all, I think the movie was fun, more wholesome than anticipated.

ek75jkq,"I honestly thought this movie was borderline terrible, although there were some genuine moments to it. This movie just falls so flat with such one-dimensional characters, dumb humor, and tired motivations. Compared to Spider-Man: Homecoming, whose characters feel genuine and not 100% stereotypes like the kids in this movie, Shazam! is laughable. In Spider-Man, Peter Parker is a teenager at odds with being a teenager, student, and a superhero, and there are real stakes to his involvement in crime-fighting. You almost feel that in Shazam! when he first fights Sivana and bleeds, but the rest of the fight scenes feel like scenes from Man of Steel where the stakes are low. Compare that to Homecoming where Peter has to escape an entire building crushing him to death - a scene that is actually terrifying. Or compare the motivations of the Vulture character in Homecoming versus Sivana. They feel real. They feel earned. Sivana becomes a super villain because his dad was emotionally abusive. Yawn. Even Peter and Ned's relationship is more genuine than Billy and Freddy's, although Freddy was definitely a highlight of this movie. They really blew their load too soon with the final act of Shazam! as well. Manifesting the Marvel family felt unearned as we BARELY even got to know some of the characters. A criticism I've seen about the Billy/Shazam dynamic is that their shared character feels disjointed. The same can be said for each of the Marvel family when they become superheros. It's just so so bad. That being said, I do agree that it's one of the better DCEU movies in recent memory. I definitely wish I had waited to rent this instead of spending $30 on two tickets opening night.",b94c5i

ek5ca7j,"It was fun. Charming. Nice. I liked it, I wasn't absolutely in love with it. I don't really have much to say about it honestly. As far as superhero origin films go it was pretty run of the mill. You get the powers, there's a bad guy with similar powers who is a nice foil to your protag, in this case Thad had a family who he hated and Billy didn't have a family but he desperately wanted one. Both were outcast by their blood families. Both get new families with lots of ""siblings"" although Thad's were using him and Billy's loved him. They were the same yet different, nice foil. They have an initial encounter where protag gets his ass kicked, then a final one where he figures out his true power. Pretty run of the mill. The saviors of this movie are the solid supporting cast including Freddy and the foster parents, and Zachary Levi who was just having a lot of fun. 

I think my biggest criticism of this movie, and I know this is a lot of speculation and I'm gonna get a bunch of replies about how this is on purpose or whatever, but I really felt like Zachary Levi and the kid playing Billy Batson were playing different characters. Billy was like this angsty runaway who pushes everyone away and Shazam was this happy go lucky full of energy guy who was always in a good mood. Obviously getting these powers and being able to transform into an adult will have some of these effects, but even after he got the powers I felt like his personality totally changed depending on which character was on screen. He goes from like ""leave me alone this isn't my real family"" to ""I love soda and pranks!"" and even though you can chalk it up to context I just didn't feel like they were playing the same core human. It's honestly a nitpick and didn't really affect my enjoyment, just a thought considering the superpower involved. 

Also, another small thing, were those bullies high school bullies or were they, like, escaped mental prison psychopaths. Like who the fuck hits a cripple kid with your car and then gets out and starts kicking the shit out of him? I understand that we need to see Billy stand up for Freddy and that bullies are an easy set piece, but that wasn't schoolyard bullying. That was like pulling the heads off birds for amusement. And all the kids are just standing around being like, ""Oh boy they're at it again. Sucks to be that cripple kid right now."" Call me crazy but I don't think that stopping two guys from kicking a cripple kid in the stomach after hitting him with your car is the end all show that you are pure of heart. I think it just shows you're a person who can process information correctly and act on it. Crazy scene. 

Overall, not bad. Not too long, the final act involving all the foster kids transforming caught me by surprise and I really liked that, it's fun to watch. Had a lot of heart, too. The scene where Freddy says he wished he had the powers and where Billy confronts his birth mother were good. Probably a solid 7/10 because even though it's not perfect there isn't really much to complain about either. But can we all agree that the ""Business office"" joke while wearing a trenchcoat is ripped straight from Bojack Horseman? Someone owed Vincent Adultman a royalty check. ",b94c5i

ekic8d0,"I'll confess that I went to see this on a bit of whim. I had a free evening and fancied seeing a film by myself. I  enjoyed this a lot more than I expected to. I don't generally get excited about comic book films although I've seen a lot of them, but I was aware of the good reviews and it was showing

It's not gonna change the world, and it's a typical family-friendly blockbuster in a lot of ways, but I thought this struck a bit of a different tone to other superhero films. It felt like a real throwback to older films with its mix of humour, a coming of age story and the joy of the characters as the wish fulfilment of having powers played out. Excusing the setting, it felt a lot like an 80s fantasy/sci-fi film and I liked that it kept things sort of small scale (although I guess it is an origin story) and the tone relatively goofy. The parts where they were testing out the powers, trying to buy beer and trying to visit the strip club got solid laughs.

I think it's biggest strength is that it is well cast. It's always a pleasure to see Mark Strong on the screen even when he's playing a rather one-dimensional baddie. The two leads kinda worked seamlessly and Levi in particular played the part of a kid really well. I thought the kid from *IT* who played Freddy as well as the other kids in the family had really good comic timing and delivery.

Only potential thing against it that really springs to mind was some of the film was a bit tonally jumbled early on. The opening and some of the earlier scenes were a bit jarring with their dark tone in comparison to the rest of the film – like the boardroom scene and the woman disintegrating – although they were well done. You could tell this was made by the guy who made *Lights Out* and *Annabelle: Creation*. But then that darkness never really resurfaced in the same way again.

Enjoyed it a lot, brightened up my otherwise miserable Tuesday.

Also bonus points for the end credits song – [The Ramones covering Tom Waits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73NdmMYZsnM). Never thought I'd hear that at the end of a superhero film.

Edit: spelling",b94c5i

elgd2lh,"I enjoyed the heck out of this movie. It had charm, laughs, and great story about what family can really mean. 

[Also HECK YEAH! MR.MIND CRAWLING ALL UP IN HERE](#spoiler)

The only real problem I had with the movie is how much they changed Sivana from his comic book self. Sivana is a genius with no need to rely on magic to take on the Big Red Cheese. Would have liked to see the super scientist Sivana and not a Sabac stand in.",b94c5i
ekg61lm,"To sum up my beefs with the movie I will give an example of a scene I did not like.

The villain has just chased Shazam into a mall, where Shazam turns into Billy and disperses into the crowd.

Everyone in the mall runs away from the villain except for Billys friend, Freddy, who stays and starts screaming ""Billy, where are you?"" right in the direction of the villain.

There was no one there but the villain and Freddy.

It was scenes like this that made it feel the movie was not made with a lot of attention to detail.",b94c5i
ek5w31q,"Shazam returns the superhero genre back to kids. It's an enjoyable coming of age film about family, responsibility, and friendship. Zachary Levi does a great job portraying the Golden Age hero for a modern audience and special note should be given to Asher Angel and Jack Dylan Grazer who made their characters' relationship believable. The film's plot, directing, and cinematography feel as if they were taken out of the late 80s but the superhero aspect made them feel fresh. 

Much of the editing could have used some work as there are scenes that do not flow together and make the film appear disjointed. Mark Strong's portrayal of Dr. Sivana is a weak aspect of the movie, but equal blame should be given to the script and the director's approach to the character. 

All in all, ""Shazam"" is a really good film for kids and families should see it together. It has a positive message for those struggling to find their place in society as well. Zachary Levi, Asher Angel, and Jack Dylan Grazer do carry the film through their characters' friendship. Some negatives include the editing and the main villain. Go see this film at least twice in theaters. 


**Notes**

* ""Lightning Hands are the new ""Spirit Fingers""
* The Seven Sins should have underwent another round of design that included coloring
* The Marvel Family could have been saved for a sequel, especially since the movie does not spend a lot of time with the kids
* How many character actors did Billy go through before finding someone who'd be Superman for his foster brother?
* Billy's journey to find his mom was predictable but we all knew what kind of reception he was going to be faced with, which made the conclusion even sadder
* DC will greenlit a movie containing a villainous caterpillar before ever attempting to return Superman to the big screen",b94c5i
ekdxy3r,I actually enjoyed this movie more than *Captain Marvel*.,b94c5i
ek67mdf,"Just saw it, I'm gonna get hate for this. Guys, I REALLY WANTED to like it. I just couldn't. I could not understand how it sits at 93% on RT right now. Admittedly I am a Marvel fanboy, but I have watched all movies DC put out too and find them entertaining as well.     
 I really tried to like it but it was so cringy and the humor was so.. I dunno, basic, and immature. I get that it's probable target audience are young teens, but so are most superhero movies. I felt like the movie dragged, I was wishing it would end soon. There were a couple of jokes that were good (from the little girl), but most were just painful. Zachary Levy reminds me of Jimmy Fallon, and that is not a compliment. I waited for the 2 post credits, the 1st I did not get but was decent I guess. The 2nd was just.. not worth it.     I could not wrap my head around how critics are raving about it. I hope I'm not alone feeling this. I am so confused right now.",b94c5i
ek6ewui,"I was really excited for this movie, but I gotta say some parts of it made it very underwhelming.

1) It felt like too much (more than a tolerable extent) plot convenience was involved. 3 examples (not exhaustive). 

* One, at the start, the Wizard just allowed Sivana to walk up slowly to the 'orb' and release the 7 Sins...? He could have just thunderbolted Sivana immediately, instead of waiting for Sivana to release the Sins and only then, thunderbolting a *fully powered* Sivana. The Wizard didn't even need to charge up a strong thunderbolt to stop Sivana from taking the 'orb'... 

* Second, why were the Sins so conveniently weak at the end, when fighting the Shazam family? What happened to the vaporizing ability of the Sin that took on Shazam? The Sins didn't feel 'Deadly' at the end, and it felt worse when I saw them having difficulty fighting rookies who had only *just* acquired their magic powers. 

* Third, while in jail, couldn't Sivana just write the sequence of symbols 7 times to reopen a portal to Rock of Eternity? I mean, it's not like the Shazam family was constantly there to guard the Rock of Eternity (as seen by the ending too) if Sivana ever did that.

2) The adult form (in Shazam mode) had such a *different* personality from the teenager form (Billy Batson). The powers given doesn't change one's personality *that* much right? This is something I see other users have commented on too, so I won't elaborate further. 

Don't get me wrong, I still loved many parts of the movie, e.g. Freddy telling Billy how much he wanted to be Shazam instead, the Shazam family reveal, Sivana's ruthlessness, the acting, the grotesque looks of the Sins, 'Billy!', the ending 'cameo' etc. But as a whole, it wasn't exactly as good as I thought it would be. A 6.5/10 for me. No doubt, it's still a fun movie",b94c5i
esmokcc,"Fuck this fucking stupid movie, waste of time and money.",b94c5i
ek5qt71,"* The villain was one dimensional, lacked motivation, and wasn’t intimidating. 

* The smoke monsters looked like shitty CGI I’d expect in a Scooby Doo caper. 

* While I loved Levi’s performance as Shazam, the disconnect between his personality and that of young Billy’s was jarring and took me out of the moment.  

* The whole idea of the Marvel Family was cute but entirely wasted - how on earth did they contribute in that last fight?

* His mother just, like, left him ... that wasn’t dark, it was lazy. If they wanted to sell that, they needed to set it up better. It seemed extremely forced. 

* I don’t mind one dimensiaonal bullies but these ones were just boring and not memorable. 

* I was so confused - 6 heroes but 7 thrones - what am I missing?

* Notmally love Djimon Hounsoa but he just looked silly, almost like a characticure of Heindall.

ek6nava,I didn't enjoy the movie as much as everyone else did.  What's wrong with me?  I went in hyped after seeing the trailer.  Everything beforehand seemed to be doing it for me but the plot seemed so cookie cutter after actually watching it.  Shazam and Billy seemed like totally different people.  They spent so much time building up the story with the mom and he seemed to be over it in a second with the phone call he receives after meeting her.,b94c5i
ek7cxtc,"I thought the movie was above average -- not great, but not horrible. I enjoyed it slightly more than Captain Marvel. (I probably would have enjoyed it more, had I not seen 75% of the film already in the trailers.)

Things I liked:

* Good action, great visuals, likable characters, decent pace
* ""Hands! Lightning with my hands!""

Things I didn't like:

* Most of the jokes were already spoiled during the trailers (but I guess, shame on me for watching them)
* The seven sins were hard to differentiate -- they could have used some color or **something** to tell them apart. Otherwise, I just saw generic looking grey baddies
* Billy seemed to get dumber as Shazam -- so much for the wisdom of Solomon *(Edit: someone pointed out Billy used Wisdom to lure Envy out... I can buy that)*
* The movie missed a great opportunity to follow up on Freddie's question from the first of the film -- flight or invisibility? During the last scene, Freddie was basically invisible to everyone in the school -- no one paid him any attention. A few minutes before, he was flying around town. He had both superpowers, one as a teenager and one as a superhero

Other thoughts:

* What were Mary's superpowers? Was she supposed to have super wisdom?
* If they weren't able to include Henry Cavill, they should have at least included Dwayne Johnson",b94c5i

Also, question to you all: During the bus scene, there is a random but very apparent old man in the background watching with everyone else as Shazam and the big baddie go at it. Did anyone else think he was the original Shazam just watching Billy evolve as a character?

Also, it was kinda weird but I felt like the intro to the foster family felt really stilted, like it just wasn’t natural the delivery. It got better at the end though.

ek6r82y,"Saw this at a pre-screening a few weeks ago and avoided saying much cause everyone with negative views was being destroyed in comments

I love superhero movies. See every one of them in theater. The preview was amazing for this so I jumped at the chance to see it early. Unfortunately....

Not good. My main issue was it seemed like two different movies. Shazam and kid Billy have very little in common. Billy is a selfish asshole who seemingly sees no good in anyone or anything but as soon as he's shazam it's the opposite.

There's no character development for Billy. He remains a jerk throughout while shazam remains virtuous. There's one scene (where shazam doesn't show at school for the crippled kid) that shows some similarities but that's it

The family dynamic was cool but again, no progression. The reactions from all the adults was also very odd. From the police not bothering to find his mum, to his mum's response when he does, to the foster parents when he's vanished, to the villians motive... None of it was grounded in reality.

The training scenes where good fun but they went on too long and didn't contribute to his progression much. I really liked the little black girl she was a great character but didn't do much.

The ending was alright but the shazam family didn't show much power beyond very basic shit and the Sins were laughable. The idea behind them is great (sins) and the character design was amazing but we're supposed to believe these villains killed millions of people yet can't even kill any of the foster kids? They're scooby-doo like and added very little

ekfpb9g,"One thing I liked about the film which I haven't seen anyone mention:

It takes place in Philadelphia.

It doesn't take place in *Metropolis* or in *Gotham*.  There's no need for suspension of disbelief about a make-believe place.

So while the story doesn't involve Philadelphia as a character (much like how New York is an absolute character in any Spider-Man film), the fact that audiences can put investment into a real-world location makes Shazam feel much more relatable than any of the other DCU films.

That's just my observation.

Shazam felt much closer to a Marvel film than a DC film, and its adherence to characters and costumes and humour *and location* all provide a sense of authenticity which most other DC films (and the comics themselves) always lacked.

> *""Not only did [Stan] Lee give his new characters these more human characteristics, but he placed them in the real world—often New York City, rather than the Metropolis or Gotham of Superman and Batman—forcing them to deal with real world problems. They had bills to pay, jobs to hold down, paramours to impress, family members to deal with, existential crises to work through.""*

Also, I think the kids all turning into superheroes at the end was kinda dumb. I know it happens in the comics, but still, it felt cheap making them all really powerful so close to the end (can they all become superheroes whenever they want now by saying ""Shazam""? Can anyone touch the staff and become one?)

A few flaws aside though, the movie is genuinely funny and has a lot of heart. Zachary Levi is such a a joy to watch and the part where Billy finally meets his mother only to find out she doesn't really care about him is heart wrenching. The CGI is also MUCH better than past DC films.

Most of the critics are giving it good reviews and rightly so, I thought it was a genuinely good movie. However, by far my biggest grievance with it, which none of the reviews of the movie mentioned was the writers of the movie cramming a bunch of annoying trends into the script. I didn’t bring a notepad into the movie with me to write down my thoughts so it’s hard for me to cite specific examples but the one that sticks out the most to me is in the montage with Shazam and Freddy goofing off and making YT videos with his powers and Shazam is doing the floss. It seemed like the out of touch writers (particularly in the first act) googled ‘what are kids saying these days’ and wrote a bunch of half-assed lines into the script. It felt like they were pandering to a younger audience and It kind of killed the family dynamic for me in the beginning but maybe I’m just overreacting to it. What did you guys think?",b94c5i

I'm honestly shocked at how awful this was with how hyped people sounded about it. I loved Zachary Levi in Chuck but this role was terrible. Seemed like a movie for 10 year olds or people that laugh at the dumbest things.

I want more things with Zachary Levi - he was fantastic as Shazam! I loved his comedic timing. I had my doubts about the kids but they were also pretty awesome. 

The only thing I didn't like was Billy's reaction when he finally found his mom. The kid did everything in his power to find her, she rejects him and he's like ""great, gotta go to my family"".

ekb2xfy,"Pros: First off pretty good film overall. The jokes were pretty good, I was pretty surprised that they actually did Shazam family, actually caught me a bit off guard with that one.

Also quite pleased they adapted the new 52 origin pretty loyally, though Black Adam is swapped out for Mark strong lol.

Is Dwayne Johnson still down as Black Adam? The wizard's exposition briefly showed him(?) but apart from that they didnt even explain how they ""got rid"" of Black Adam... (assuming the magic hologram was showing Black adam) if they ever make a Shazam 2, I hope, they will use black Adam instead of the caterpillar...

Read up a couple of interviews of director Sandberg, he seems like a real comic book fan, so I'm glad DC is finally getting some directors with their hearts and vision in the right place.

Cons: the costumes feel very ""costume like"", the lighting bolt on Shazam's (and the wizard's) chest looks like a silicon LED sticker,and his boots looked really fake in the close up shot...

~~God dam headless superman, from the fuking supergirl show!!!! Fuck!~~

The screenplay though, could definitely be streamlined a bit more, the movie didn’t need to be over 2 hours long, the final battle dragged on just a bit too long; they negotiates in the tent for like five minutes and then go back to the Ferris wheel, and oh the 2 dickhead bullies are still there. They also negotiate for 2 / 3 scenes? That's just kind of awkward and clunky.

Also the 7 deadly sin's voices were... hard to listen to. Their cgi doesn't mix with in the environment, it was ok in the wizard room, but once the y got out in the real world it just looked off...

Conclusion: DC / WB is learning and improving, thank god, keep it up! I'm now actually looking forward to their next instalment in their universe. (The flash? Is that right? cause I heard the Joker movie is not set in the same universe?)",b94c5i
ekbt0d6,"The recurring thought of ""If I was a superhero, I wouldn't have half my problems and it would be so cool."" was sometimes the only light of imagination present when I found myself stuck in a limbo of being bullied, questioning my purpose and getting over self doubt.  
As you grow older, the light dims and the caves get coarser. You get blinded by the chase of something, something that you feel like if you had it then it would fix everything in your life. But we are fools and everything we need to feel better is right in our reach, always. That's what Shazam! taught me. Only the third time I've felt like this after Patty Jenkins's Wonder Woman and Richard Donner's classic Superman. A thought from a pool of optimism, a takeaway from the power of authentic storytelling. 

Shazam! is a classic superhero film filled with innocent humor and an unpretentious woke personality. The film is aware that it exists in the market of superhero saturation, people are tired and bogged down with tales of the ultimate good and saving the world. Realizing one's potential and defeating the evil within you is a done concept. Shazam! just tells you the simple story of a foster kid, Billy Batson, and his adorably well-written family. His accidental superpowers and some whacky relatable experiments with the same. Along with some genuine moments of sentiments like the one I mentioned in the beginning. The jokes almost always land, and DC seems to have finally struck a balance of humor and emotions with this one. The whole cast is a delight to watch and the family is just a roster of people that you are either gonna love or love. This makes me very excited for upcoming projects and if I will get to see more of the Shazam family with the most anticipated Black Adam who is just referenced here. 

Shazam! is a good time at the movies and will refresh you with its charm and heart. It's probably the funniest superhero film since Deadpool, and this one doesn't even rely on a cliched plot and an R rating. It goes straight to the thunder. PS: Zachary Levi is a cutie and man DC is back in the game or what! ",b94c5i
eke3g8g,"great movie - i was as impressed with this film as i was with Spiderverse. I know there will be detractors but this is definitely the film that Aquaman was trying to be- the script dialogue and acting were all on point and yes the lead has character- you SEE the difference in ""Billy"" and ""shazam"" (Idealized Billy) even though they are essentially the same person.

the Marvel Family coming together and appearing had me in the same space i was when Wonder Woman showed up - in the otherwise visual porn of BvS

( so quick - did you miss Eugene Choi screaming ""Haduken!"" when he lighting blasts the Sins )   

Mark Strongs villian was a little TOO ""mustache twirlly"" ...but overall the movies strong points overshadow this fault...

this movie was well worth the price and will ( and should ) hold up upon any subsequent viewings ",b94c5i

ek68b6b,"I watched this movie on Wednesday night in Australia and the theatre was packed! I loved it just as everyone else did. 

But although there is no good way to put it, I still wanna say the adult Billy actor is trying way too hard. His efforts of trying to make the audiences believe he’s a child on the inside are forced, unnatural and obnoxious.

Billy is a child who doesn’t seem to talk a lot and a bit keep-everything-to-himself. The adult Billy turns out to be an entirely different person. Levi just wants to act like an average derpy kid instead of Billy. I mean, he’s basically 15 years old and has gone through a lot as a foster kid, while Levi makes me think he can’t be older than 10.

Love the kid actors far more than the adult ones.",b94c5i

ek5fm34,"Just saw Shazam! with my 10 year old. I asked her how she liked the movie and she said she didn't like it. I asked her for a star rating between 1-5 and she gave it a 2.5. I asked her what the last really good movie she saw was and she said ""Spiderverse"". I asked her which she thought was better Captain Marvel or Shazam! (Captain Marvel was the last movie we saw together in the theater) she said Captain Marvel (she really liked goose so I'm not surprised). I asked her if she could have the powers of either and she said Captain Marvel ""cause she's a girl"".

Personally, I thought the film was okay. The villain was 1 dimensional (as are the 2 bullies) and chewed up the scenery. The trailers gave away all the funny parts which seemed funnier in the trailer. The acting between Billy Batson and Shazam didn't match up, the younger actor was quiet and serious and Levi is loud and silly. A lot of the scenes suffer from a sense of claustrophobia, too many close shots. The seasonal setting makes the whole film seem off. The plot seems to meander around.

On the up side, some scenes are shot really well. The lighting with Shazam near the thrones had moments that made me think I was looking at an Alex Ross painting. Levi doesn't look as silly as he did in the leaked behind the scenes shots (though the padding in the suit is obvious, Levi pulls it off). The child actors are fantastic as are the foster parents. The film is entertaining and maybe it'll become something people watch during the holidays.",b94c5i

I think legit the only gripe I had (and it was because it was quite possibly the most astronomically stupid thing I've seen in a movie in quite some time) was the plot about his mother.

Jesus that was truly a turd.

Outside that though, this was a straight forward, fun, light-hearted, family friendly, throwback to simpler comic movies and was all the better for it. Highly recommended.",b94c5i

ek6zdnf,"I saw this during the Fandango screening a few weeks ago and liked it, but I'm a bit lower on it than a lot of the responses here are.  Full disclosure: I don't find the character of Shazam interesting. I'm sure when I was a teenager the idea of a 15 year old who can become a superhero would have been really cool to me, but it just doesn't appeal to me now.

What I liked: It doesn't surprise me, but I thought Sandberg did great with the horror-ish scenes, the Sins being unleashed in the boardroom in particular. The scientist being disintegrated by the door was great, too. Between James Wan and Sandberg I'd love to see the DCEU keep using horror influences and maybe even make a straight up horror movie. I also really enjoyed the training montage set to Don't Stop Me Now, and the villain speech scene. I also really liked Jack Dylan Grazer and (especially) Asher Angel, who killed it in the scene where he learned the truth about his mom.

What I didn't like: I thought the action scenes were mostly pretty bad. Mark Strong was fine, but I thought Dr. Sivana sucked as a villain. It's a little strange to me that this movie isn't getting any flak for being the 100th superhero movie where the hero and villain have the same powers. I didn't particularly like Levi, it felt to me like he was playing a completely different character than Angel, and I just don't think he has leading man charisma. With no prior attachment to the characters, the Marvel Family reveal did nothing for me, and actually made Freddy a less interesting character. Freddy as a disabled foster kid who has to help his kind of asshole-ish foster brother learn how to be a superhero is interesting, when he also has superpowers it's less so.

Quick aside: Was the sin with the vines Lust, and is that supposed to be an Evil Dead shout-out?

I know I'm listing more things I didn't like than I did, but I really did enjoy this movie, just not as much as some others here. It's a 3/5 for me, and I'd slot it in as my 3rd favorite DCEU movie.",b94c5i
ek91wcv,"Pretty funny and enjoyable! My favorite part was when the villain was monologuing but Billy couldn't even hear him. Also really funny when it.turned out that the house he knocked at wasn't his mother's. And when he told all his friends to yell his name and they yelled 'Billy!'

Loved the lampshading of superhero tropes. Felt it went a little kid's movie at the end there though, with his 'true power' being friendship. Super predictable. And it was obvious that it was going to end with him putting his hand in for the dinner prayer and showing up to make his friend look cool.

 I remember reading long ago that Superman was going to show up at the end and tell Billy to keep up the good work, but the cameo was in jeopardy because of all the contracts/shitty reviews/rebooting/box office fails going on at DC. I was wondering how they'd get around that and their solution was pretty good — just don't show his face. 

Not sure how I feel about sequels now that his friends are all superpowered. I think they were good enough without superpowers, it would've been more fun that way with Billy being the main guy and his friends doing kid shenanigans to help hiim out. They have the swole guy who can lift things, the smart guy, the little girl who can be used to distract someone, etc.
Now, it just seems like a Justice League-lite and gives me Thor 1 and 2 vibes where the friends are just kinda...there. They don't get much to do other than a few one-liners and motivational speeches or being useless and getting captured/dying.

I was impressed at the subversion of expectations with his mother. I was sure that she was in bad health or something and that's why she couldn't go look for him and that the bad guy would capture her and force Billy to give up his powers for her life. The scene and her acting seemed kinda flat though. She didn't even try to apologize or make up for it/reconnect with him. 

Liked the villain's origin story, but then he just became the standard monologuing bad guy and then they didn't give him any more development or internal conflict and redemption.
Wonder why they didn't reveal their powers to the foster parents. Saving it for a sequel I guess.

Honestly got hyped for half a second when I saw the Batarang and thought Batman actually showed up to wreck shit.
Could've used some more action and some cool, well-choreographed fight scenes rather than boring, TV-show level wirework. Maybe some badass slo-mo brawls to show off his superspeed.

Didn't get the significance of the YouTube videos they were uploading, they didn't lead anywhere. It thought that would lead to the villian finding him but it seems like he flew there after watching the live news report.

Pretty much the whole time Levi was on screen, all I could think of was 'Well, that's just Jimmy Fallon in a cape."" Seriously, I think you could Photoshop Fallon's face onto him and nobody would even be able to tell.

Overall, more than a little clichéd and childish but a fun weekend watch nonetheless. It'll easily tide you over till GoT and Endgame. Went in with zero expectations considering the recent trend of DC movies (haven't watched Aquaman yet) and was pleasantly surprised.
The part after he gets his powers and they were playing around with them was gold. Could be fun to watch him interact with the justice league.",b94c5i

The editing was also really awkward, from betraying the blocking of a scene to hindering the comedy. And the pacing was strange. It wasn't offensively bad or anything but it sped through somethings and stayed in some places WAY to long. Also, I felt like they wanted to make Shazam a huge dick but they weren't allowed to. Crutches' speech, saying that Billy was being a dick, didn't land as hard as it should of. Like Shazam wasn't being a hero but he wasn't being a huge ass, he was just being a kid.

ekb058u,"I am honestly baffled at how this movie is getting good reviews. Was basically shaking my head in disbelief throughout the whole movie. 


The bus scene in particular was absolutely ridiculous. People are falling down and crashing into the front window and not only does the window not break when he catches the bus (after already being cracked) somehow no one is seriously injured. I get that he has superpowers but physics still exists in this world and that window definitely would have broken when he was trying to catch it (he caught it maybe 6 ft off the ground?? and the bus still takes the impact) and the people in that bus would have been injured. 

The deadly sins in the final fight could go into smoke to avoid physical punches from Shazam but when his family is fighting they just seem to lose that power. Not to mention how many times they had an opportunity to just kill random civillians and choose not to. Also Shazam going into kid form to get away from the monsters hold and then not immediately turning back after getting away just so he could be ""drowned"" by the bad guy.. jesus that made me want to scream out loud in the theater.

The main bad guy could have killed the members of Shazam's family so many god damn times but of course he doesn't, seriously how many times do you have to be tricked by him and yet you still let go of all your insurance when he says ok I'll give you my powers.

* The Seven Deadly Sins don’t look much like representations of their specific sins. I’d say they're more in keeping with the average monsters that Hellboy would be comfortable punching.

* If the Seven Deadly Sins have been imprisoned inside the Wizard’s statues all these years why does the world still suffer from greed, pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath and sloth? Clearly the writers lifted this idea from the Greek myth of Pandora’s Box but then forgot the part about the sins never being put back inside.

* None of the monsters use aspects of the sins their named after. Wouldn’t it have been cool to see Lust or Gluttony using their aspects to torment the hero?

* When freed these monsters can turn to mist as to avoid being punched, ability they forget they have later on.

* Silvana gets his power from being possessed by these Sins/Monsters, but his power level doesn’t seem to fluctuate, even if he’s down to just one of the Sins residing within him.",b94c5i

Parents divorced at 3, moved to Philly 20 months later, so 5 (or very close to) when his mother abandoned him. Her excuse to why she left him was that she was 17 at the time. Not a great timeline. Who's letting a 12 - 14 year old get married and divorced?

**Some things i didnt like:**

\-Zero to none thrills

\-Awkward Christmas setting

\-Marvel family plot holes. I mean we saw Billy a 15 yo boy trying to figure out his powers in a span of maybe 2 weeks? And the rest of the family flying around fighting and zapping things in a matter of seconds.

\-Shazam didnt showcase his powers enough.

\-The villain was ok but didnt feel like a threat.

\- Too light for my taste

**Some good things:**

\-Some wholesome and funny moments

\-Cgi was ok considering the budget of the film.

\-Zach,Freddy were great.

\-Headless Superman

\-Almost all the characters in the movie had a proper introduction, enough to care about them.

It was fun to watch, i didnt get  bored at any point but i didnt feel any ""chills"" either. Shazam is the ~~weakest DCEU film~~  weakest solo DCEU film so far.Maybe younger audiences will appreciate the movie more than i did.

ek5i5y7,"##Warning Spoilers!

I really liked it. Shazam! is one of my favorite DC movies, I had a great time from start to finish. It was definitely worth seeing in theaters. The cast is great. The pacing was really good, and didn’t fall apart in the third act. The CGI was pretty good, but there was one scene that really bugged me, when Dr. Sivana opened the doorway from his office into the Rock of Eternity and we see him standing there in the doorway and it looked really bad.

 I love the kids and their Shazam versions. I like that the kids have all the powers of Shazam, even if we see each of them mainly use one, Freddy used Flight, Mary used Invincibility, Pedro used Super Strength, Darla used Super Speed and Eugene used Electricity Manipulation, we do see all of them fly over to join Billy after he’s defeated Dr. Sivana. It’s also really interesting to note we never see any of them use the [powers of Solomon] (https://shazam.fandom.com/wiki/Shazam). I love the fact that that in this movie that it is anytime that Billy says Shazam he switches and not just him intentionally wanting to switch.

There are tons of easter eggs in this movie.

Billy and his adopted siblings go to Fawcett High School, Fawcett Comics were the original publishes of Shazam.

The Holy Moley and Gee Whiz are great callbacks to the time he was made.

There are a lot of reference for Billy’s tiger [Tawky Tawny] (https://shazam.fandom.com/wiki/Tawky_Tawny). Young Billy wants the tiger toy. Billy has a tiger on his backpack. Then at the end of the movie he gives the scared little girl the tiger toy.

We get a lots of cameos and reference about Shazam related villians. >!The first end credit scene has [Mister Mind] (https://shazam.fandom.com/wiki/Mister_Mind), that’s an interesting choice for the villain of the possible sequel.!< Freddy opens the door with Crocodile-Men, >!I believe these are [Jorrk, Sylverster and Herkimer] (https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Crocodile_Man), they even tie into the first end credit scene if DC decides to make the Monster’s Society of Evil as they are all members.!< Pedro opens a door with a plant that tries to attack him, This is might be a reference to [Ramalus] (https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Ramulus_(New_Earth) who has the ability to control plants. >!He also can tie into the first end credit scene as he is also a member of the Monster’s Society of Evil.!< I’m pretty sure the door Darla opens with the strong wind is also a reference to ~~another villain of Shazam but I’m not sure who right now~~ [Nyola] (https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Nyola_(Earth-Two) who is a magic-wielding weather-controlling Aztec priestes, >!She also can tie into the first end credit scene as she is also a member of the Monster’s Society of Evil.!<. I’m pretty sure when the wizard was explaining telling Billy why he wanted a champion of pure heart, the previous champion was Black Adam.

I really liked how they used the fact that other heroes already exist in this world with the references all over the place. The Batman toy scene was great and I believe that was Kevin Conroy’s Batman. >!I also really liked the Superman scene, even though we don’t get to see his face.!<",b94c5i

Few complaints from me: I thought they made Billy too much of an asshole.  He literally walked away from Freddy getting beat up in front of everyone.  Billy just seemed too far from a potential ""pure heart"" candidate at the beginning and even after he was awarded the powers.  Second, I wanted more fighting.  Too much of the movie was testing his powers out but not actually testing them out on baddies.  He also doesn't really fight the villain at the end.  Wanted more lightning hitting bad guys lol.  Finally, I WANTED TO SEE HENRY CAVILL. Not just superman but Cavill. Oh well. 8/10",b94c5i

Aquaman & Shazam have restored my faith in DC.  It's a shame that the two weren't released in Christmas for Shazam & Late Spring for Aquaman.  I am guessing production issues caused that.

My two biggest nitpicks were how the bullying was handled.  Freddy got run over and attacked, and nobody alerted school administration about it.    And even though Freddy was shown on the news having a conversation with Red Cyclone, none of his classmates seemed to have seen it to know that he does seem to have some kind of relationship with the person.

Otherwise really good, it deserves the 92% rotten tomatoes score.  I'd probably give it a 9 out of 10.  I hope they fast track a sequel while the actors are still young.  ",b94c5i

The seven deadly sins that go from ""dangerous entities"" to pets. The billy that is serious as a child but playful as shazam. The interaction with his brother that begins with a mutual agreement in using shazam's power to personal gain, but soon after the brother delivers a moral speech. Everyone around acting like someone shooting lightning off his hands is normal.

ek65yz3,"Initially I really liked it (and still do kind of), but the more I think about it the more the movie annoys me: 

1) Billy finds himself encountering violence EVERYWHERE.

2) They copied the 'dorky kid being friend of superhero' trope from Spiderman 

3) I don't understand why Billy was never truly afraid of Sivana. He's a kid and gets hurt. 

4) As others have said, Billy and Shazam are 2 opposite characters and don't feel like they're playing the same kid. 

5) **THIS ONE I HATE MOST**: The sins can turn into smoke and can't be physically harmed as demonstrated by Billy trying to fly into one of the Sins.... UNTIL THE SHAZAM FAMILY WRESTLES WITH THEM ALL FOR THE NEXT 15 MINS. ",b94c5i

ekva3uj,"Just watched Shazam and DC has continued the streak of entertaining DCEU flicks.

The humor was pretty funny, a good amount of memorable jokes in there for eg the bullet invulnerability from the trailer, there's more to it than what's in trailers, but some of those jokes do end up kinda messing the final 20-30 minutes of the movie. I did enjoy the family dynamic between Billy and his foster family, especially the foster brother, a great side character and even the rest of the side characters were good too. And props to Zachary Levi, he really did seem like Billy's adult form as in a goofy reckless teen in a superman-like adult body. The villain is pretty one dimensional and not really that memorable. He has some contrast to the Billy but is really only touched upon slightly in the end.

Now one of the bigger annoyances about this movie, besides a rather messy third act that needed a bit more focus, is the CG. The effects on the CG in this movie is pretty bad, like once you see these CG related effects on screen, they looked abit video gamey for lack of a better term. They standout in a bad way IMO.

Overall, it's not all that amazing but if you're looking for a fun movie that knows it's goofy and embraces that goofiness by making fun of itself a number of times, Shazam is one flick that could hold you down till Endgame. A solid 4/5.",b94c5i

I was super bummed, but I was able to get a manager that I’m familiar with to snag me the last seat for the next showing while everyone lined up for re-admit passes.  

I just got out of that later showing, and holy crap was that a captivating movie!  It was in no means perfect, but that was an absolute ton of fun.  

I’m really looking forward to more of the Zachary Levi/Adam Brody dynamic should there be a sequel. 

I’d say my biggest complaint is some of the acting.  The foster mother was absolutely awful, and many of her lines were delivered like she was reading them out loud for the first time.  It didn’t feel sincere, it felt like a commercial.  The woman doctor who gets dusted at the beginning was the exact same way, and the majority of the kids weren’t great. 

Overall it was a fun time, and I’m hopeful we will see a sequel with some Black Adam action!

I enjoyed the film in almost every aspect besides the Shazam family. Even though i thought it was awesome to see them on screen, the introduction of the Shazam family causes a lot of problems for the DC Universe. Warner brothers can’t make another Shazam film with just Billy, if they have Billy take on a villain alone it wouldn’t make any sense because there are 5 other gods that he could ask for help. It would also be hard to explain why only Billy is in a justice league film and not the other 5 gods that live with him. It’s just going to create a lot of plot holes.

ekjx8al,Can someone clarify how they got out of the Rock of Eternity? Does Shazam indeed have teleportation powers?,b94c5i
ek5qgem,"Saw it wednesday. I thought it was OK.

Best bits is with Shazam! in character, his interactions with Jack Dylan Grazer and them trying out the powers and just goofing around - it's easily the best 30 minutes or so in total, the school security guard scene of them skipping class is hilarious. Everything else is sort of by the numbers, very standard as far as action and story goes.

Technically -  the score is very mundane and forgettable, the VFX is 50/50, most of the technical stuff is all in all passable and functional - feels very mundane to be honest - I was expection a little more flair and personality with an even more personal touch (different framing, editing and photography) but it's OK, nothing out of the ordinary for a blockbuster superhero movie. 

All I can say is, it feels like a standard Marvel movie, it's passable and cute entertainment, feels pretty safe for the most part.   
The storybeats are (mostly) competent, the family aspects and the themes of parental figures is done fine, it works - this in combination with the lighter goofier tone and chemistry between Zachary Levi and Jack Dylan Grazer has this movie from being a total bore.

Some of the writing is pretty thick, like the whole Sivana character is pretty dense and like ""whoa what? he did all that, this is pretty convoluted, seems like a fucking reach here"". He just feels like a literal cartoon villain and all of his dialogue is in line with it.

I'd give it an in the middle 5/10 if anyone is asking for an actual rating.",b94c5i

It's great that the whole Marvel Family got to make their debut, probably would have loved it more if they weren't spoiled by having their Funko Pops on sale months before the movie. Also, what are they called now? The ""Shazam Family""? lol

This movie however made me realize something, and that's that writers and producers do not understand how to write a ""gamer"" character, or video game humor, similar to ""hacker"" characters. I should say now that this does not detract from the movie's quality, it's just a pet peeve that I have. Anyway, I feel like they all have this generalized view on what a ""gamer"" is, which is this dated caricature of a distracted kid that yells ""Die!"" a lot at a screen, then have them throw in a few buzz words here and there, like ""Hadouken""

The one that stuck out like a sore thumb for me was when that Eugene kid said he learned how to ""hack"" because of the game Watch Dogs. If anyone in their team had actually bothered to play Watch Dogs, they'd know that that game doesn't tell you shit about actual hacking. You just point at something, you press a button and voila, ""hacked."" But no, the game is about hackers so therefore, you can learn how to hack by playing that game. Throw in the word ""mainframe"" to make it more believable

Anyway I should probably stop the rant there, because in the scheme of things it's just a nitpick and a pet peeve of mine. The movie was very good. I'm psyched to see more, and to see how Shazam interacts with the Justice League",b94c5i

eu34ars,"I was expecting the movie to be somewhat a teenflick of comedy just kind of the same realm as 'superbad' with explosive jokes and action in a superhero theme.

&#x200B;

God was I wrong, kids comedy at best, acting wasnt great from any of the actors, neither from the kids or the superhero/Adults themselves, I think the best actors where the two foster parents at best, at least they seemed to have somewhat of an existing chemistry.

Some few plot holes, I fail to see how Billy was anywhere near the candidate to hold Shazams power, just doesnt seem the type of kid to have a pure/kind hearted personality, hell any of the foster kids would of filled that 'need' X10 more then Billy could have.

&#x200B;

I also dont get how the tranformation works, when Billy turns into Shazam does his mentatility also change?

Its weird having contradicting scenes where it seems like hes acting childish as if he was still Billy, yet in other scenes he acts over the top genuilely happy when Billy comes across as the stereotypical depressed non-interested teen, its like the grown up shazam is that old dad/Guy that tries to be 'cool/hip' with the younger generation from his acting...

its badly conflicting would be the word to use here between the kid and him transforming into the superhero.

&#x200B;

Villian was alright, again kind of dissapointed that he got outsmarted by a bunch of kids that didnt seem to know what they were doing up until they got superhero status... After him playing in Sherlock Holmes and Kingsman, I was suprised to see him play in this mediocre movie, screams desperate moment in his career imo lol.

&#x200B;

Chuckled at maybe 2/3 jokes in the entire movie, to be honest, I wasnt in the mood to turn of the stream once I reached the 30 minute mark, I knew that I would be dissapointed with the movie but wasnt really motivated to change it, I kinda wished and hoped that it would turn to the better, but it never did.

&#x200B;

2.5/5 would be my rating, just average, not reccomemend to anyone above the age group of 15+ tbh, unless if you are a superhero fanatic.

Theres nothing special really about the movie, and as stated I think this movie would of had great potential if it had 18+ Jokes and Billy/Shazam acted way more cocky, but unfortunately it catered to a kids movie which sunk its potential.

Edit: HOWEVER, Billy's mom subplot did not work for me. I get why they felt it was necessary to the foster-family plotline... I just felt it was tossed in late in the game (him finding his mother) without adding much to the story. By that point, I think it's already believable that Billy cares about his foster-family.",b94c5i
ek77dqz,"Movie was damn fun and I love how it was self-aware it was a superhero film through Freddy. Yet at the same time, the movie was in some way darker than expected. Holy hell were the parents assholes in the film. You can easily understand why Dr. Sivana turned out the way he did. The way he killed that boardroom and his family with the Sins was horror movie-like (I looked up and found the director has a history of directing horror films like Annabelle and Lights Out).

Then you have Billy's mom abandoning him just because she couldn't take care of him.... but the never bother trying to reconnect or find him again. I also found it hard to believe she was 17 in the flashback scene(should have used a younger actress)... does that mean she had Billy when she was like 13 or something? I did find it strange that the cops didn't bother searching for her to return the kid.

Zachary Levi did an amazing job playing a man-child as Shazam though. You can't help, but feel like he had a lot of fun with the role. Despite the great set up for Dr. Sivana, Mark Strong unfortunately have much to work with other than trying to take Shazam's powers.

I enjoyed the arc of Billy coming to terms with finding his mom and accepting his new family. He also seem to come to grasp with being a bit less selfish.

Also liked the training montage with Billy and Freddy, but I feel like that could have been shorten to give more time with his family. I don't know a thing about Victor. Meanwhile, what becomes of Mary and her college admission? I feel like there should have been a scene that showed how close was with her family to give further impact to her college acceptance.

I thought it was interesting that the one feminist who was being robbed was poked fun at especially in this day and age where that seemed more taboo.

The Shazam's form is suppose to be when the kids are at their physical peak right? If so, how come everyone aside from Eugene(adult actor is 28) is aged up to nearly 40 (based on the adult actors)? Isn't the 20's considered the physical peak?

What was Mary's power? I can't remember if she anything during the Sin fight.

ekdy2kp,"After watching Shazam last night and coming out somewhat disappointed with what I have just seen, I kept thinking if it wouldn't have been better if they made it as an animated film, like Into the Spider-verse.

Since the story is inherently silly in the first place, they would have gotten away with everything in an animated form. The CGI and overall look of the movie were pretty bland for the speculated $100m budget and Spider-verse, which cost around the same amount, had style for days, even doing stuff we haven't seen before by incorporating hand drawn techniques from comics into animation.

Tawky Tawny would have definitely worked as a character instead of just being an easter egg in a few scenes and they would have had free reign to go nuts with whatever zany idea they had.

Also, I felt the pacing dragged in the movie and since animation requires a lot of storyboarding it would have flowed a lot better in that form.

What I'm saying is that after Spider-Verse studios shouldn't be afraid to make some of their superhero properties into animations, because it can definitely be a better choice as opposed to the limitations of live action, but the downside to that is it takes more time to make and since they're interested in profit, it's not going to happen as often as one would hope.",b94c5i

It was okay I guess? Just nothing seemed that great. The CGI was patchy at times, and the special effects just ropey. That bus glass was strong enough to support its entire weight? 

Mark strongs villain seemed somewhat underwhelming too. He went straight into hunting down Shazam because some demons told him to.... didn’t stop for fun, or to get some henchmen.... or anything. It just seemed like “go kill this kid... okay” 

The bullies where cringe and unbelievable. 

The plot was kind of non existent at times, and the training montages took way too long.  I was so bored near the end, and when it got there all I saw was two guys flying around poking each other in the face.

We the viewers didn’t have to see half of it, for it to make the same level of sense. like... why so much Christmas?

Why didn’t Billy Facebook his mum?
Or google her... Or ask a teacher for help... why once he got his Shazam power didn’t he go and fly around looking for her? When he did find her why didn’t he zip there speedy quick? Why go up to the rooftop just to jump down? 

I’m not a follower of the comic books but  7 was telegraphed throughout the film, glaringly apparent, 7 sins, 7 seats, 707 on the mums door or “7 on 7.” Yet the *cringe* Shazamily is only 6 members?

He was great chemistry wise but I can’t believe for 1 second that he and Asher Angel are supposed to be the same person. They are so different personality wise. Zachary plays Shazam as Chuck and most of his other stuff, a goofy, awkward kinda guy. 

Jack Dylan Grazer was the star of the movie for me. What a promising future for this young guy. And I also believe the guy that plays Shazam’s version of him. ",b94c5i

With Shazam though, the stories of relationship is told is a much better way than in Capt Marvel. Acting could be better and the editing needs to be tighter, too many anti-climax and the climax wasn’t hitting hard enough. 

It’ll have trouble keeping up if it’s released this close to Avengers Endgame. ",b94c5i
ekeu4sx,"I loved the movie. The only two things I'd change is:
• Give the demons their very unique appearances and give them the line or two to better differentiate them and make them not just a CGI-mess that the hero needs to defeat.
• After Billy gave his foster-siblings the powers, I think it would be lovely to give them different set of powers not derived from Shazam.

All in all, I really enjoyed the movie though.",b94c5i

ekcqr9w,"I saw it tonight and came out somewhat underwhelmed. It was fun when him and Freddy were trying to find out what powers Billy had, but after that I started to lose interest because the pacing was so static and the movie was overlong for what the storyline was. Mark Strong as Sivana was pretty meh and the buildup towards the final act dragged quite a lot.

I felt the script was pretty low effort because it felt more like it was ticking boxes instead of flowing naturally.

In terms of acting, Jack Dylan Glazer was the only one who stood out for me. Everyone else was serviceable and Zach Levi probably overdid it at times compared to how Asher Angel played young Billy. The stiff poses and walking I found awkward at times, as if he was an action figure, but some jokes were funny and he tried his best.

Overall it was fine, I guess, but there was so much more they could tap into considering it was inspired by Big, which I'm a huge fan of.

eke8seg,"movie is just alright.

Levi is the best part about this film, but the kid who plays 14 year old Billy is pretty good too. The kid from IT who plays the best friend though is the real breakout, didnt expect to like him as much as i did.

Villain was trash. Why does DC keep giving us CGI monster things to fight for these films? 

Im assuming the champion who initially started this whole thing was Black Adam? Im not to familar with shazam lore, not gonna lie, i was hoping we'd get the rock in here for a bit, i get why they held off though.

the film is a slog overall. it was fun, but felt longer than it was. had tons of logical leaps, aka ""how did this person know that?"" moments.  Im looking forward to a sequel, where we get mostly Zach Levi, with no set up needed. Could do without the shazam family (except for meagan good, my gawd, keep her)",b94c5i
ekg2exy,"What a ***fun*** movie. While I loved Into The Spider-Verse, it spent a lot of time mulling over darker topics - the only time that Shazam really got close to that was when he met his birth mother. It was a funny, exciting, and cool movie. The fact that this came out of the same studio that released Justice League is mind-boggling. This is the first time in a while that I've said something like this about a DC property, but: I can't wait for the sequel.",b94c5i

Anyway massive disconnect between teen Billy and Shazam, and the rest really. All the superheroes act like little kids, yeah I get it, you got super powers and it's super cool but I think the actors could have put in more work to convey a similarity. But then again the kids didn't really have anything beyond really superficial traits. Mark Strong came off as really generic. Direction wasn't particularly good, and the script is downright awful, cringy, soap opera level dialogue. For comparisons sake, people might hate it, but I'd rather watch Green Lantern on repeat than be tortured by this. Things just feel off with this movie - it can't find a tone, the direction is sloppy, the dialogue bad, plot generic, major disconnect between characters.",b94c5i

ek7uuf4,"it was alright, don’t get the super positive response to it - lots of the jokes felt kinda forced and cheesy and i genuinely didn’t like some parts. some things they bring up could have been referenced to give it even more heart- it felt to me as though they had all the pieces of a really really good superhero movie but kinda forgot about how much substance they were working with and ended up wasting a lot of the potential they could have unlocked. characters were interesting (except for bad guy who was crazy default and bland) but i felt like there was too little interaction with them to the extent that i didn’t really care about any of them except the boy with the leg. same with the deadly sins and the bad guy. billy in superhero form was a completely diff person- he was cooler than non superhero him but still acted like a dumbass to the point where some stuff he did i just got annoyed by, and him as a boy was just mega stupid and edgy and some stuff went unexplained like him stealing the coins, the flight or invisibility thing, how dude broke his leg, i dunno i think i’m just takin this poorly. i’d give it a 7.1/10 it was a blast but just kinda standard and shallow",b94c5i
eke2q1j,"Watched it last night and I found it to be an overall over-hyped and over-rated superhero movie. 

&#x200B;

I thought the acting was fine, nothing special; and although Shazam was great at acting like a child, I found it to be a little obnoxious towards the end. 

&#x200B;

I found the conclusion to the mother's story to be forced - just to give the viewer's a reason to sympathize, and also to motivate the  main character. It didn't feel natural. 

&#x200B;

Action sequence was boring. Too much use of the slow-motion. And towards the end, Shazam appearing ""suddenly"" and ""majestically"" was over-used (particularly when he was being drowned).

&#x200B;

After the training sequences in the beginning, most of the jokes were boring. My entire theatre was .......

&#x200B;

First 1/3 of the movie was fantastic though. It just didn't pace itself well for me. Overall, a decent DC movie, and I've seen worse... about 6.5/10

I dont know, most of the stuff people are saying they enjoy, i didnt. I didn't find it that funny (except the youtube copyright, that got a laugh out of me), I thought the acting was okay. I really didnt like Zach Levi, I mean I definitely thought he was believable and he did a good job acting, but his character I thought was annoying. The villian was not that great and Mark Strong didnt really have much to work with IMO. The kid actors were.... fine I guess. Definitely not as bad as the Dumbo kids. Although I thought the 7 deadly sins looked neat.

ek5p3ak,"Shazam! is a clunky movie, but there is so much to love about it. The way it was put together definitely makes it less than the sum of its parts, but those parts are so good that you can’t help but enjoy the movie in spite of its flaws. There are so many scenes that are 8/10, 9/10, and even 10/10, but they’re put together kinda weirdly and there are parts that feel out of place and odd. The composition and editing bring down the overall quality of the movie, but not too badly. It’s charming and full of heart. From watching the movie, it’s obvious that David Sandberg understands what makes Shazam work and did his best to stay true to the character and what Billy Batson stands for. It’s a good movie and easily my favorite DC movie. Go watch it, both to have a good time and support a movie that spits directly in Zack Snyder’s stupid, smug face.",b94c5i

ek5nw59,"I never thought I'd say this but I'm genuinely starting to enjoy the DC Universe, perhaps even more than the MCU. Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and now Shazam have all been excellent films that totally got their characters right. What I love the most about these movies though is how each story is so uniquely entertaining. None of it feels formulaic, I liked every one of these movies for completely different reasons. Shazam was just so dynamic, Warner Brothers weren't afraid to make a hero that didn't fit a stereotypical hero mold. Billy acted EXACTLY how you would expect a 15 year old who just got powers to act, like a gigantic douche. His character development didn't feel forced or cliche either. The growing bond between him and his foster family was well paced and ended up being believable (The chemistry between him and the boy with crutches was actually pretty good)  Also the Marvel family reveal blew me away. The marketing for this film was on point and every studio should take note. The trailers got everyone excited to go see this film but still didn't give away any of the huge twists or funniest scenes. It got me genuinely excited for any sequels or future team up films like Justice League. I'd honestly love to see his interactions with characters like Aquaman and Wonder Woman. Tbh if DC fixes their Batman/Superman problem, puts a little more time into making us genuinely care about their characters, and fleshes out their universe a bit more, both Flashpoint and Justice League 2 could be amazing films that rival, and perhaps even surpass the Avengers.

Score is a little on the weak side but the second time around I noticed it more and liked more of it. 

Sivana and the Sin’s motivations are a little murky. What is the end goal other than kill Shazam? I give the movie a little room on this regarding Sivana since he’s alive still and looks like he will be in a sequel. The prospect of seeing him and Mr. Mind teaming up is awesome.

ek5qk9r,"Shazam! - Review

It's not perfect, but the good outweighs the bad more often than not. With a fun story, boundless energy, and an irresistible sense of wonder this is easily one of the best-installment of the DCEU so far. (Not counting out Wonder Woman)

Direction: I feel like David Samberg is the DCEU's take on Thor Ragnarok or Guardians of the Galaxy (other world type story). He's not really known for much past some horror, which made him an initially odd choice for this movie; a choice that paid off extremely well. He helps shine some light into this world, but doesn't underplay the action. His direction and coordination through framing helps us laugh and, in some cases, feel the punches. The action isn't shaky, like the other DCEU installments and due to the bright vibrant colors, we really know what's happening, where it's happening, and who it's happening to. Well done.

The writing can be uneven at times, but definitely fun. It's a story that converts Billy Batson's origin into a modern-day retelling with some elements of Big in there. The humor is timed well and consistently funny; a lot of the jokes and humor from side charactershelp the story obtain its brighter feel. The relationships are extremely well written and heartfelt.

Performances: I swear, Zachary Levi was born to play Shazam! He carried childlike enthusiasm effortlessly. Mark Strong played a menacing villain. The child actors, especially Jack Dylan Fraiser was my favorite of the bunch and seeing his super hero version was wonderful with perfect cast of Adam Brody (The OC)



Basically go see this movie. This is easily the best incarnation of any superhero in the DCEU

IF they decide to play it right Shazam, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman team-up movie could be really cool.

If it doesn't have much physical comedies which is timeless(Charlie Chaplin, Tom & Jerry, memerable Friends episodes that have physical comedy etc), these movies can't be constantly rewatched (at least by me). 

Most of the movie is well done with kudos to the teen actors and Zach Levi. Mark strong also did a great job as always, and most of the humour landed for me. The only thing that might go against the movie(imo) was maybe the action was a little bland.

Also, directed really well and paced decently.

One problem maybe is that Zach Levi really was way more juvenile than the actual teen actor who acted more stoic. So there was a bit of a mismatch between how Billy and Shazam acted. ",b94c5i

***\*Spoilers below\****

&#x200B;

That scene when Shazam dropped Freddy's bullet into the sewer was hilarious to me. 

I actually liked the special effects when Shazam uses his speed. 

I didn't understand the conflict between Billy and Freddy. They went from testing out Shazam's power to ""fuck you, you're selfish."" or something. Guess I fell asleep at why Freddy was so mad and said to Billy that he is now the bully. A showoff, yeah. But not a bully.

ekf08cf,"I saw this movie over a preview weekend two weeks ago and I loved it and have been waiting for its official release to discuss it!  I really found this movie enjoyable on a macro level, but I thought it was negligent of its messaging in a few areas that have nothing to do with the story itself, but the cinematic responsibility of having a movie this big open wide ostensibly to young kids and families who will attend.  My first point of contention is that it glorified gun violence in a way that I found disconcerting.  Yes, gun violence is par for the course in any superhero film, but the scene where Billy and Freddy are up against robbers at a convenience store where they ask him to ""shoot him the face"" felt a bit irresponsible.  Yes, to me, as an adult, this scene was funny.  But the idea of young kids watching it believing shooting someone in the face that is impervious to its consequences (and does not exist in real life) felt dangerous.  My other point of contention was with Pedro's character.  Pedro, as a superhero adult, had more lines and characterization than his child counterpart which I would argue, is more important to the story than his transformation into superhero.  I understand that he is meant to be shy, but why limit the scope of this character in a way that wasn't done with the rest of the foster siblings?  It also sent the wrong message about body positivity:  Pedro is overweight as a child and regardless of where you are on the spectrum of this debate, a child should never be made to feel BAD or less than because they don't live up to some kind of physical standard.  To have his superhero counterpart grow up to be a lean bodybuilder sends the wrong message:  you can only be powerful like this, never like that.  Jacob Hall of Slashfilm writes about it [here](https://www.slashfilm.com/shazam-body-issues/) and articulates it in a much better way than I ever could, but I'm glad he discussed it because it was an immediate red flag for me.  Overall, this movie is perhaps some of the most fun I've had at the movies in a very long time, but as the industry grows up and becomes aware of its shortcomings as it has heavily over the past couple years (whitewashing, representation, income parity, etc), writers and creators must take a responsibility for the broader dialogue they take part in as influencers of culture.",b94c5i

ekabtc8,"Found it pretty painful to watch for the most part, and apparently I'll be in the minority on this. Before everyone starts downvoting and flipping out at me, I shouldn't have to say that this is just my opinion.

In terms of character logic and most plot events, this felt like a 90's movie. I wonder if that's when the screenplay/script was written. People said the same thing about Venom, and I thought this had a similar sort of feel to it. I just found Venom way more entertaining. 

Feels like the kind of movie someone who doesn't know you very well rents, assumes you'll love it, but even as a kid you thought it was kind of stupid, but you pretend to like it so as to not hurt their feelings.

The strongest (maybe only strong) scene was billy confronting his biological mom. The movie's at its best when dealing with the kids inter-relationships (and also at its most cliche and predictable), and at its worst everytime shazam is on screen.

Was hoping for the Marvel Family and was giddy when I got them. Still, sad no Tawky Tawny but at least they had the tiger reference. 

Kinda surprised how intense the bad guy stuff got for the subject matter. Villain is not complex but at least he comes from a solid emotional core. I was hoping for a Dwayne Johnson cameo in the mid-credits but, oh well. Gonna have to look up the caterpillar because I was familiar with everything else but my knowledge reached its limits with that one.

About my only complaint was I think the Superman ""cameo"" at the end was real dumb... maybe you get away with it if you show Henry Cavill's face but the way it went was a sour note to me. I guess that might be due to the rumor(?) Cavill's not Superman anymore. (I don't even know how Billy would have met Supes so quick.)",b94c5i

The cgi was ok at times, it suffered from the seven deadly sins but other than that on point. But it is the heart of this film that steals it. The writing was fucking superb too. The scene with the mom silenced the theater. At the end I suspected we would see the Marvel family but I did not recognize a single actor until the credits rolled. Even Meghan Good and Adam Brody. Mark Strong was good but the villain in and of himself is not an interesting one. The big crime in this film though is the lack of enough Mary Marvel.

This film is like a throwback to 1980s kids movies. It was great. Mary was using her textbook as a weapon. Like, seriously? You have access to kitchen knives.

John Glover just hangs out at DC?

Glad they addressed the creep factor. Reminds me of Lego Batman where Barbara points out how creepy it is that Robin is hanging out with Batman.

""Get him, Batman!"" my favorite part. ""They were very persuasive!""

His momma is the real villain for abandoning him. And he never deduced that that was what happened? You don't just lose a kid, unless you're ICE.

That said, I hate how the people were caught mid-fall. They would've been killed in these falls.

It is a little stupid that Batman is not just an urban legend. They also could've addressed the dark side of foster care: when Mary turns 18, she will be financially cut off by the state. In real life, she would be cutoff by her foster parents too.",b94c5i

ek768cl,"If you enjoy reading my spoiler-free reviews, please follow my blog @ [MSB Reviews](www.msbreviews.com) 

First of all, I didn’t know anything about Shazam. What his powers were, what story did he have … Basically, I didn’t know who he was. This is what David F. Sandberg‘s movie does best: introduce the audience to a new DC superhero, by delivering an uncommonly well-structured comic-book screenplay, packed with laughter and entertaining action. Zachary Levi is undoubtedly the standout! Not only is he hilarious, but he perfectly captures the childlike personality that a kid-turned-adult would have. His expressions of absolute surprise and awe of his powers are extremely precious, and he effortlessly carries the more lighthearted tone on his shoulders.

Asher Angel is brilliant as Billy Batson. His character has a notably well-written and well-explored backstory, which eventually justifies the person he has become. It’s the most emotional and heartfelt subplot of the film (probably the only one, really), and Henry Gayden did a fantastic job writing its script. It doesn’t feel cliche or over-the-top, it actually feels grounded and quite realistic. Jack Dylan Grazer plays his best friend, Freddy Freeman, and he’s the primary source of self-aware comedy. He knows all the cliches regarding superheroes and supervillains, so his jokes constantly land and play seamlessly into the last act.

Usually, villains tend to be hollow characters with paper-thin motivations, but since a few years ago, this issue has gradually been corrected. The latest comic-book movies have incredibly well-developed villains, who carry a compelling backstory that entirely supports their beliefs, but not their actions. This type of villains work because not only the audience can understand where they come from, but in some cases, they can even connect with and care about them. Dr. Thaddeus Sivana is not exactly someone the audience ends up caring about, but his backstory is emotionally powerful enough for us to understand where his motivations originate from. Mark Strong delivers a menacing performance, and his costume/make-up looks pretty badass.

The first act is kind of a mixed bag. It starts in a very captivating way, and once you understand who’s the character at the center, it gets even better. However, the film’s tone takes long to establish itself, and the beginning of the movie struggles to find which jokes land and which don’t. The humor is on-point throughout the rest of the runtime, but those first few jokes not so much, which threw me off a little bit. The action sequences are amazing, and the sound design allows the audience to feel every punch, kick, a fall on the ground or a Superman-ish take-off. The fight sequences are seamlessly edited, and you know how much I love well-choreographed or well-edited action scenes.

Shazam‘s search for his powers provides the funniest and most entertaining moments of the film. Each test that he puts himself through is both hilarious and informative. This is another aspect of the screenplay I love so much: they had several ideas of how to approach this segment, and they nailed every single execution. From the pop-culture references to the hero-villain cliches, Sandberg did a terrific job exploring those concepts, and he executed them flawlessly. The best jokes are the ones that can be funny on different levels for different people. If people can laugh at a particular scene solely due to it, but other people can laugh even more because that moment means so much more to them, that’s when you know a joke is perfect. Shazam is not only funny for comic-book fans, everyone can leave the theater entertained and jolly.

It’s still a straightforward superhero movie. There’s still a villain to defeat, and the film goes through all of the cliches that it makes so much fun of. Everyone knows how it’s going to develop, plot point by plot point, a few minutes in. Not that I consider this a flaw, it’s just … It is what it is. The final battle drags too much, and it keeps ending and restarting every five minutes. It does have a pretty cool conclusion, but it takes a bit too long to get there. Also, and I know that this is one of those logical nitpicks that CinemaSins are known for digging, but the flashbacks and time-jumps could have received better treatment concerning the age of the characters. One thing is to think that the characters would look much older/younger than what they display on-screen, but when they make them look exactly the same in the span of 30/40 years … Not so acceptable.

All in all, Shazam is a blast! It’s the most entertaining movie I’ve seen so far this year, and it’s freaking hilarious. It continues the comic-book films trend to change how villains are written, by delivering a well-developed bad guy, menacingly portrayed by Mark Strong. Every member of the cast gives a strong performance, but Zachary Levi steals the show. His whimsical attitude, reckless personality, and rich facial expressions are guaranteed to entertain you for most of the runtime. Asher Angel and Jack Dylan Grazer are outstanding as the young kids, and the former’s backstory carries emotional impact which passes on to the big guy he transforms himself into.

The action is packed with beautifully-edited sequences, powerful sound design, and cool, unique moments, but the supposedly climactic final battle drags too much. The first act struggles to find its rhythm and its tone, but once it gets going, it’s an exceptional journey. The best praise I can give Sandberg‘s movie is that I didn’t know anything about Shazam before entering the theater, and now I can’t wait for its sequel. Well-directed, well-written and remarkably entertaining. What more can I ask? Go see it!

Follows some standard super hero formats. Some of the humor/slang will NOT age well as time passes (but was good in USA for now). The school bullies are WAY over the top (and nowhere in Philly can you park the way they do). Main antagonist is good, but he spent decades of his life so he could be a moody teenager and tell his dad that ""he was strong enough"" and then he let someone else kill him after he kills his brother?

I liked the comedy until it became a repeat(Captain Sparkle..whatever). Freddy was good, the little girl was good, the asian kid was good but that's it with the family. I liked how they did a power test but was lack luster with using them when he needed too. But these are the small things.

&#x200B;

The biggest thing i disliked was the fight scenes. The mall scene dragged out and could have been utilized better with Shazam learning his powers. He's suppose to be stoked he can do all these crazy things but when one guy blocks a punch and punches him, he  goes full baby and runs away. The Shazam family was a cool thing(I didn't know there was more Shamies in the comics), but how pointless it was other then to show them off. Freddy who has been the most vocal on superpowers and everything else about super heroes only talks and flies around. He should have been dancing around those clowns but the little girl was the one outshining him. Mary was just standing there flailing her arms around(I actually thought about how she was just standing there moving her arms around in make believe at an imaginary demon thing looking a fool). No joke go look at that whole scene. Once Gluttony(?) opened his mouth and she started flailing, she stayed that way the entire time. Even when  Levi brought Mark strong's character back, just before he took the eye she was still just standing there flailing around. And then there was Shazam's fight scenes at the end. It was like sitting at a light next to a douche in his Porsche revving his engine till the light turned green. It would start up and then immediately stopped for whatever reason and then start up again and then stopped. I was waiting for that goosebump moment that would get me into the movie but it just never came. How hard would it have been to get Billy to walk out in the open at the carnival and say: ""Hey one-eyd willy. My names SHAZAM!"" and go nuts on the dude even if it didn't hurt him.

ekc8tuj,"So did the producers of this movie look at Fantastic Four 2005 and think let's just make this movie again; where the only time superheroing is being done is when it's by something that that is their fault, and the rest of the time it's just showing off,  but the characters were just far too likable.

&#x200B;

\*Here be spoilers\*

Let's have a movie that is supposed to be teaching us about the power of family, except the mom is absolutely horrible person, but if she had been a good person,I guess the main character would just drop his foster family in a hot second. But she isn't so back to the foster family because  he loves them now.

You also can't make fun of bad super hero movie tropes while giving into them at the same time. Yes someone far away is not going actually hear the evil monologue, but you can't throw the same scene in twice, 5 minutes apart where the big bad villain is going to take all the power, ooh but at the last second it doesn't happen.

Zachary Levi had some good moments, the kid playing Freddy had a couple of good lines, but they're otherwise thoroughly unlikable people. Even the wizard curses out a young kid for failing a test; I'm supposed to be on his side?

It made me think more fondly of Captain Marvel, it was bland compared to most of the MCU standard, but atleast I didn't consider walking out on it.

The movie was fun, but to me it was not a good movie. It was cheesy. Poorly acted for the most part (outside of Levi who I adore in everything). Bad villain. Bad fight scene. The wizard bestowing powers scenes were so bad that I thought they were jokes. The casting outside Batson and Freddy was very, very poor in my opinion.

It felt like a Teen Nick show turned into a movie. It felt like a power rangers movie. It had the tone and quality of Jack Black's Goosebumps.

I would have much rather waited for it to come to Netflix.

\*Spoilers\*

There were clear issues with the editing throughout the film. The script wasn't remotely believable. (He just happens to witness an attempted robbery in the park immediately after getting his powers? He just happens to be in a convenient store when two guys walk in with guns? He just happens to be across the street when Mary walks in front of a car?) Deus ex machina like Eugene, a little boy who plays video games, being able to hack into the FBI's database is the hallmark of lazy writing. Not to mention the criminal underuse of John Glover. Possibly the best adaptation of an abusive father in the DC universe was his portrayal of Lionel Luthor in Smallville, but rather than expand on Sivana's family dynamic from the great opening sequence, the film chose to undercut it entirely by immediately killing him off in his next scene. All the characters who weren't Billy were as one dimensional as could be. He had no relationship whatsoever with Eugene, Mary, or Pedro, but they still tried to hammer home some united family message. Even his relationship with Freddy was largely circumstantial and shallow. The CGI was horrid. The fight choreography was lackluster. There was a palpable disconnect between Levi's Billy and Asher's Billy. It's as if Sandberg told Levi to play a generic 14 year old rather than actually play Billy Batson. Different mannerisms, facial expressions, speech intonation, everything was incongruous about their performances. Sandberg showed a fundamental lack of understanding about the characters he was bringing to life. A kid who is brave and caring enough to stand up to two huge bullies picking on his new foster brother but also steals that same foster brother's prized possession just because? Shrugs off multiple felonies? Is callous and cavalier about almost murdering a bus load of people? And I guess over the course of a 2 hour movie they couldn't find a single instance where the Wisdom of Solomon could be useful? Actual super intelligence that makes him a godly genius who can solve advanced physics equations on the fly and speak every language? Guess he never got that courage of Achilles either. You know, that ability that imbues him with an innate, superhuman propensity to not back down? Sivana even calls him a coward in the movie after he runs away, but he is supposed to be by nature heroically courageous. They touch on Freddy's entitlement and selfishness but never give him any character growth. They try to make the villain seem ruthless and intimidating in a poorly acted and directed board room massacre scene (a woman pressing herself up against and clawing at a window while trying to escape as if this is a believable response to the situation, the lack of any actual blood when being torn apart by superhuman creatures with long claws and sharp teeth, the inexplicable silence as the security guard approaches the door even though people are being actively murdered on the other side), but then made him a kiddy villain whose actions have no real consequences. We all knew none of the characters were in any real danger, which is fine for a film to do if they hadn't intentionally made him seem ruthless and menacing. That isn't the character you portrayed him to be! They purposefully chose not to make Black Adam the villain so they could build up Captain Marvel's archnemesis in his own movie, but then they just gave Sivana Black Adam's power set anyway. They took something unique like the Seven Deadly Sins and turned them into generic, corporeal monsters that looked like Scooby Doo villains that the heroes could duke it out with. Shazam's exposition scene with Billy was visually appealing but too detached to be believable as the wizard's own life story. Where is the shame in creating Black Adam? The sadness over the loss of his friends? The desperation and urgency that Billy accept his mission and power to stop the destruction of the world? Instead we get an impatient and rude old man who is lecturing like a disgruntled history teacher. It was stuffed with so many jokes that even though only about half of them landed, people have seemingly forgotten about all the others that fell flat or were plainly inappropriate for the situation (i.e. a kid being so unphased by being teleported into a magical realm that he is comfortable making penis jokes to a wizard talking about the death of millions). This film had so much potential and squandered it. But if DC puts out a passably watchable movie, people seem to laud it as a work of art. This was an objectively awful film. Subjectively, it was passably entertaining, though noticeably flawed.",b94c5i

e: hopefully at least someone will see this a second time and come around to my view. She's adorable, and she's got some great moments (I liked everything about her keeping Billy's secret), but the actress delivered about 5 lines out of her 15 or 16 or so that landed for me.

ek8rp4m,Can you explain what causes him to fly?,b94c5i
ekcso2x,I know he used to be pretty much invulnerable so they had to force/trick him into saying Shazam and now I think in order to use his powers it must be for pure reasons. Doubt they went that route considering he uses it for just about anything but in the beginning lol,b94c5i
ek5e4x3,Hopefully they'll get Armie Hammer next.,b94c5i

ek5neem,"I think you meant 20-30 years ago. 10 years ago was 2009. 100 percent agree with you tho, this movie definitely has a family movie vibe to it that’s become a bit more rare these days ",b94c5i
ek5xrs7,What Fortnite reference ? I must have missed it.,b94c5i
ek9w99j,"Oh my god, I said the exact same thing coming out of the theater last night! I felt like a kid again watching Shazam. I loved that they weren’t afraid of adding some horror elements with the deadly sins or being brutally honest about life with Billy’s birth mom. 

It felt like back then movies didn’t shy away from shaking kids up a little, and I think that’s why some films have stayed with me all these years and made a huge impression. Beetlejuice scared the heck out of me at 5, but it’s truly a fave all these years later, and Neverending Story gives me goosebumps if I try to rewatch. Aside from the Fortnite reference, it didn’t seem to pander to the audience and didn’t try to be something it’s not. I hope some kids left the movie loving it and with a lasting impression to look back on.",b94c5i
ek7g5vx,Yes. I got the same late 90s/early 2000s vibe from this movie. Very much in the same vein of an action family comedy. Can’t pinpoint exactly what movie it felt like but I know where you’re coming from. I was thinking about that the whole way through. ,b94c5i
ekbdjpb,I was thinking the same. The score in some places reminded me of 90s kids movies.,b94c5i
ekx41ns,"Over the top bullies were actually something I enjoyed. In much the way you thought this movie could have come out 10-20 years ago, I thought this added to it. Think about Flash the way they did him in *Spider-Man (2001)* vs *Spider-Man: Homecoming.* I'd actually go even a little further back than that and say that the bullies felt like 80s-90s villains, which was kinda great. Honestly, the whole movie had me feeling a little like a kid again in a way that I can't quite put my finger on.",b94c5i
ekgfbcf,"This movie did come out 20 years ago. It was called Spider-Man starring Tobey Maguire. Not that it’s a bad thing, but they basically have the same character development. And the Green Goblin is creepy",b94c5i
ekx50ur,"Yes! I'm surprised nobody else has been talking about this. It definitely felt like a 90's family adventure movie to me. The campy humor, ""scary"" jump scenes, awkward child acting, lessons learned, and ""bad guys have red eyes and deep gravelly voices"" trope all brought me back to that era. The one movie that kept coming to my mind as a comparison was **Jumanji**.

In particular, what really stood out to me were the ""this person is saying a swear word!"" scenes where they'd show a close-up of a person's face at a dire moment saying ""Oh, shit!"" It's the type of thing you'd see in a lot of 90's PG movies, where they'd get their one swear word in for shock value/humor, and they made sure you knew it was there.",b94c5i

*We don't see* any fallout from it. That's not the same as ""no one gives a shit"". The story follows Billy, who runs away from them, and then gets abducted by the wizard. I don't remember exact dates or times in the movie but I had the impression that several days passed between the attempted homicide and when we saw the bullies again. They could have been suspended from the accident to the day in the cafeteria and had a stern talk with the SRO (but not stern enough to result in expulsion or legal action) and it just wasn't relevant to the plot. That's scary if so, but not completely implausible. In real life some bullies really do get away with a lot of shit that they shouldn't. 

Beyond that, [adults are often useless](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless). This movie is mainly about a teenager with abandonment issues and superpowers. The more problems in it that police, teachers, and parents solve, the less there is for Billy/Shazam to do.",b94c5i

If you see the superhero genre as being like a fantasy escape from reality, then the way Shazam and Billy act so differently makes a lot of sense from that perspective.

The movie kind of brings it together at the end when Billy becomes more assertive in becoming and ""owning"" the Shazam personality.

The two scenes that come to mind are the one where he leaps off a building and shouts Shazam, and the scene in the community fair where he's striding confidently like a superhero as Billy and then transforms into Shazam and he really seems like the same person from a mannerisms perspective.",b94c5i

&#x200B;

In the post-credits scene Mister Mind seems to be trying to form the Society, with Sivana as one of his recruits.  And the two worked together in the comics numerous times. In comparison Black Adam typically works alone in the comics. He never teamed up with Sivana  in the original Fawcett comics, having only appeared in one story.

Compare that to Sivana's whose first thought about getting powers was indeed, ""THEY MUST PAY!"" and to go on a murderous rampage.

We're initially led to believe that Billy is a delinquent in the first two minutes that we meet him, and then we soon after find that at the heart of his acting out is a kid who just wants to find his mother and be reunited with his family.

Shazam appears to pick Billy as a candidate to be champion after Billy kicks the asses of the bullies who picked on and beat up his foster brother. It would seem to me that he knows well enough that Billy is a troubled kid but he sees the potential in him and thinks that is good enough.

And unlike Doctor Sivana, Billy doesn't have a lust for power or the ability to control people. He did act like a little shit but he also had a shitty childhood, has pure intentions, and has shown the ability to do the right thing and protect other people when the situation called for someone to be a hero.

*(Sorry if this is long-winded)*

When he first becomes Shazam, it seems like his loner mentality immediately dissipates as he's more freaked and wondering what all he can do (if you just gained super powers, imagine how you'd react). However as the movie progresses, specifically at the point of Billy and Freddy having their falling out, Shazam is a lot more like Billy in that he's reverted to his loner personality. His personality finally settles somewhere between these two states after he finds his mother and learns of the truth behind his childhood, culminating in his dinner speech towards the end where he's genuinely happy and no longer feels alone.
",b94c5i
ek8tkzq,"This is a complaint I find to hold a lot of weight. For me personally, Billy is just too determined and broken to be that kind of goofy. When he becomes Shazam, he becomes perfection.

Speaking of which, if she was 17 when he was 2 or 3, how on earth is she not on social services' radar? She did not get government benefits to raise the child?

The CGI issues didn't bug me. They could absolutely have been better, but they were far from YA movie bad.

ek6g9mg,"You are not alone... for me, it felt like too much (more than a tolerable extent) plot convenience was involved. I am gonna paste what I said in another comment. 

3 examples (not exhaustive).

* One, at the start, the Wizard just allowed Sivana to walk up slowly to the 'orb' and release the 7 Sins...? He could have just thunderbolted Sivana immediately, instead of waiting for Sivana to release the Sins and only then, thunderbolting a fully powered Sivana. The Wizard didn't even need to charge up a strong thunderbolt to stop Sivana from taking the 'orb'...

* Second, why were the Sins so conveniently weak at the end, when fighting the Shazam family? What happened to the vaporizing ability of the Sin that took on Shazam? The Sins didn't feel 'Deadly' at the end, and it felt worse when I saw them having difficulty fighting rookies who had only just acquired their magic powers.

* Third, while in jail, couldn't Sivana just write the sequence of symbols 7 times to reopen a portal to Rock of Eternity? I mean, it's not like the Shazam family was constantly there to guard the Rock of Eternity (as seen by the ending too) if Sivana ever did that.

He literally won the battle by tricking the last evil sin to get out from Sivana’s body with the most cliché dialogue ever.

At least Billy and Freddy learned something from their experiences and Dr Sivana was a direct obstacle to everything the movie was about while Peter ends up fighting the same kind of people he says he wants to protect.

ek7lzwm,"Seems like you're comparing apples and oranges to me. Shazam! didn't really try to go for a horrifying tone outside of the boardroom scene. The core theme was family, which is something Spider-Man Homecoming didn't even really attempt to tackle. The scene where Billy meets his mother and she just appears frazzled, embarrassed and mostly uninterested in him is a really powerful one. It impressed me when he hands the compass he had treasured as a sentimental memory of his mother back to her with a one-liner about how she might need it more than him right now and instead of breaking down and tearfully reconciling with him after an emotional epiphany, she nonchalantly asks ""what's this?"" Because to her, it was meaningless. She abandoned her kid and she has no interest in reconnecting. She's not his family. 

But the core was the humor, and if it bounced off of you then there's no way you'd enjoy it. Personally I thought almost every single joke landed, which is pretty tough when you're being this goofy. It could easily have come off as trying too hard, but everything just worked. ",b94c5i

Obviously none of this happens in the movie. Freddy makes a joke about his foster father throwing him out of the window, but it's clearly not true. The obvious implication is that Freddy has used a crutch his entire life, and has long ago made enough peace with that fact to joke about it.

Yes.

The story is an almost perfectly faithful adaption of the first arc of the n52 Shazam (which wasn't its own comic, but printed in the back of Justice League). The only reason it's not 100% is because of whatever issues they had negotiating with Dwayne Johnson, as Sivana releases Black Adam in the comic instead of fighting himself. 

But Billy's attitude & depiction, the foster family & their hero versions, etc are all near 100% from the comic. Even the bit with the bullies and trashing their car (although in the comic their rich asshole dad is also a character, harassing the foster parents, and ultimately gets inhabited by the Sins to create Sabac).",b94c5i

We grow up in a society where we're taught that there is nothing stronger than a mother's love, so asking a young child to just accept the fact that his mother just disappeared one day without explanation and for no apparent reason is a lot to ask and hard for him to accept.

I understand movie opinions are subjective, but I really am having a hard time grasping how so many people loved this movie, while I sat there not enjoying and feeling like I was watching a completely different film. Big standouts for me were:

&#x200B;

* Yeah, the ""stopping a bus 6 feet above the ground saves people from death of hitting the ground."" This bothered me.
* The whole intro scene and ongoing plot of ""Finding someone pure of heart."" Wtf does that even mean? A lot of the lines around this got so over-the-top and cliche, I was waiting for the movie to ironically call them out, but it never did. Not to mention when the kid (later villian) enters the cave in the beginning of the movie, and he has one stranger who gives him no clear direction, then starts hearing voices that tell him to touch a ball, and he's punished for it? Wtf? It's like the random voices he chose to listen to were bad and he should have known it.
* Awkward campy jokes that seem like they're out of a 90's family movie.
* Strange and awkward acting moments pointing (one that stands out to me is when Shazam goes through the closet door in the house to the lair, and foster parents are looking for them later and the mom asks, ""Why is this open?"" Like, idk, closet doors are open sometimes. Don't worry about it, your kids are missing.
* Lots of goals that aren't clear until they're completed. ""Oh, they pull the eye out of his head, and all the monsters get sucked back into the ball."" ""Oh, they can just put the evil ball on the post again and it will be protected."" ""Oh, Billy's supposed to walk through this magic door in their house, and apparently everyone knows it means he's going to die? Or something?""
* In the end carnival climax, Billy sees the ferris wheel start to crumble, which prompts him to turn into Shazam...and promptly start fighting the villian forget about the ferris wheel until it becomes a convenient plot point for the fight 15 minutes later.
* Handing the tiger to the girl in the carnival booth. Lots of people said this was sweet. I thought it was weird. Even as a kid, if I'm freaking out about a supervillian threatening my life, I don't want some weird stranger walking up to me and patronizing me with a stuffed animal.

Anyway, I know I'm in the minority here, and I'm typically pretty laid back and enjoy most movies, even ones that are generally disliked. But I did not enjoy this movie, and I'm still perplexed by the amount of praise it's getting. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯",b94c5i

ek6capy,"You're being a touch bit too nitpicky

1 - This is just a convention of superhero movies.  In the 1st superman film lois and clark get mugged, which is unrealistic going by crime statistics.  I think the only movie that approached this subject believably was Spiderman Homecoming.

2 - this might be true, but dorky sidekicks have been around for awhile.  Also Freddy is a subversion on the Mentor character a la Obi Wan or Dumbledore, whereas Ned is just a friend of Peter's and a sounding board.

3 - I don't get your criticism.  Billy runs away and briefly gives up his powers after meeting Sivana because of fear until his friends are endangered and he has no choice but to fight back.  If you're talking about Biilly not being scared during their first meeting, it's obvious Billy isn't taking Superherodom seriously and still feels indestructible. 

4 - I agree with you here.  I like both versions of Billy but the kid version doesn't have nearly the same kind of cockiness or fun once he knows he has the powers.

5 - I also agree with you here, but seeing the marvel family was enough to distract me from the plot point.  I think they should have just cut the bit of Shazam flying through the monster.

So i agree and disagree with you.

Edit add: my biggest nitpick was bad physics.  Shazam stopping the momentum of a falling bus and the ground stopping the momentum of a falling bus should have been no different to the bus.  This also happened again with folks being saved at the ferris wheel and Shazam saving Sivana at the end.  But realistic physics from superhero movies is asking a bit much.",b94c5i

The wizard teleport him and then ""tests his heart"" with the first test, he fails and shows that he's easily susceptible to the deadly sins enticement. Implying he's not that great of a person to begin with. When he fails he gets back into the car, and is upset that the Wizard didn't say he was good enough. He has a fit in the car still trying to get back to where he was where he causes the accident. The brother hates him even more (blames him for the dad's accident) and the dad hates him even more. When he approaches him in the board room he even refers to that day about how his father was even more of a dick to him because he made him a paraplegic and how he ""blames him for screaming"" (which ultimately caused the accident). He then say something to his brother along the lines that the brother was a dick to him and hated him even before that accident.

Also, came to the same conclusion of something they excelled at something better than Billy's power (since Freddy made an emphasis on Darla's speed, and I think Pedro stating his own strength, and Eugene being good at lightning) but was overall weaker than Billy.

But I googled it to see if that made sense. However, it seems that in the comic universe, when he splits his power, it's Billy's power they are effectively leeching off of.

Only Freddy got the power to fly, and they said earlier that a lot of it was absed in belief. Freddy had already seen Billy fly so he didn't have as far to go to get to believing he could do it.

>There's a difference between a film for the whole family and a kid's movie with horror and adult humor thrown in. This movie was a mess tone-wise.
  
This was one thing I saw as a potential flaw. It was otherwise a very fun, lighthearted and 'wholesome' film with a big degree of family friendliness, but the prologue, disintegrating woman and villain's revenge on his family seemed like they belonged in another film. I put this down to the director coming from a horror background (and if you've seen his other films, it makes perfect sense). I could see it upsetting some kids, not that the scenes actually bothered me. On the other hand, it gave the film a very distinct feel from the countless other superhero films that we've had over the past decade or so. It reminded me a lot of films from the 80s that had were aimed at a wide audience, and popular with families but had dark elements and some horror to them (*Raiders of the Lost Ark* is just one that springs to mind). I think what's weird is that the horror scenes sort of sit in isolation from everything else in the film without any smooth transition, and they all sorta disappear after the first 40 minutes or so, which makes them a bit jarring. 

> I think Levi was really convincing as a kid exploring his powers. 

Agree about Levi , he played the role well and convincingly. I didn't know who he was before seeing this film (he's not a well-known name over here), but I'm now eager to see him in other stuff.

>On the other hand, every moment of Freddy was dreadful.

What in particular? You're not the only person who has said this, but I thought Grazer was one of the highlights of the film – particularly the double act of him and Levi. He seemed really natural.

I just don't know where to begin.

First it sounds like you hate it because it's DC.

Second the family aspect. You have a child who lost his mother then spent his entire life trying to find her. He is 14 and doesn't have the mental capacity to make the connection if she hasn't looked for you she doesn't want you.


In addition he never want another family he wanted his original family. It took getting his heart broken to wake up and see he already has his family.


The humor was perfect. Not overly cheesey, not awkwardly added either. The character development was also amazing, we actually saw a hero go from inability to use powers to slowly getting used to them. At no point was Shazam a master of his abilities, just more comfortable. 

Continuing the story line pacing was great. It didn't fall into the standard super hero timeline where a big major event happens and our on screen hero failed miserably. Only to then refight later with no changes and win.


Shazam lost his first fight you could say but he also is a 14 year old boy and not a super hero. He didn't try to fight just tried to run. The fight made sense, as you honestly didn't expect him to just win there. Next fight also had good pacing and required the help of his siblings in addition to using his new skills better.


All in all this was hand down the most refreshing super hero movie in long time. Marvel movies are just cookie cutter anymore. She they are good but they all follow the exact same pattern and it's predictable but enjoyable. DC movies recently have been just horrible directed and bad writing total mess. But not this one (or wonder woman).

Actually he was walking away.  It was only when one of the bullies made a ""mother"" comment that it triggered Billy enough to jump in.  And in fact that's something I liked about this movie.  Billy wasn't a pure and unbelievably moral kid.  He **was** a little shit, and it was only until the negative example of his mother and the positive example of his foster family mixed in with literal life and death that he grew out of it.

And was called on it.  Again, he was a little shit, but he was completely believably a little shit.

So yeah, completely disagree with you on the choice of not making Billy a marysue-esque perfect kid.

On the other hand I do agree with a lot of your other points.  Very movie-convenient for Shazam to be right there for so many crimes/danger, but I think I'm a little more forgiving for that because it is in fact a movie.

And I was thinking ""The trailer has a talking raccoon with a gun, of course audiences will go for it!"".

No one was skeptical when Ant-Man rolled around, and you can see that Phase 3 MCU movies were more willing to embrace some of the silly stuff (IT'S MY BIRTHDAAAAAAAYYYYYY) and the fantasy elements. (directly talking about magic, as opposed to the first Thor movie where they said that their ""magic"" was really just super advanced technology) And starting with Aquaman, the DCEU has been willing to embrace those elements as well. Most of these characters have been popular for decades, so it's not a surprise that audiences are open to these movies.

The most horrifying scene with the 7 sin monsters was by far the boardroom. Everything with them after that was just CGI villains watered down from the menacing presence they had initially.

The brother getting thrown out of the window was shocking and effective and set the tone for the rest of that scene to work as well as it did, but yeah.

el1vcb5,"Going in, I was really worried that the moment where he jumps off the roof before transforming and flying away was the ending shot of the film, and was the best it was going to get, similar to the ending shot of the Amazing Spider Man 2. Boy was I glad to be wrong. So many awesome moments. And being a fan of the comics, I could see the pieces falling into place for the shazam family to make an appearance, as all they would have to do was touch the staff, but I was a bit worried they were going to skip it.  It was such a great moment when the anticipation paid off, and Billy just turns around, staff in hand. ""Say my name."" I was practically jumping up and down in my seat as the smoke cleared for the reveal.",b94c5i

Also speaking of the suits are they padded or CGI? Shazam has some ridiculous delts.",b94c5i

I don't think they realized this movie was special enough that 10 seconds of Cavill as Superman would have pretty much erased all memory of Justice League. ",b94c5i

ek6pfkd,"It's a catch-22, though.  The movie was great because DC/Warners probably stayed pretty hands off.  But that also meant they weren't going to put the real Superman in it.  If the studio brass treated this as one of their DCEU films, they'd have fucked it up greatly, but we'd have had a legit Superman cameo. 

I prefer what we got.",b94c5i

Or, it could be funny instead. No need to see it so cynically.",b94c5i
el141bp,"Because having the face probably adds a ton to the budget. As opposed to doing it the way they have.

I would also argue that given this movie seems to exist in a universe where Batman and Superman are far more established. It might make sense not to show a superman that might not be cavil if they recast.

Like there are batman toys in stores and purchasable batarangs. Yet somehow in BvS batman is a myth, they aren't even sure he's real, it's not until someone starts branding criminals they even seem to give a shit. After which Batman cleans up his act a little bit due to supermans death.",b94c5i
ek5w5r5,"Yeah, great way to finish the all around perfect movie with a taste of disappointment.",b94c5i

So it seems like they're gonna call him Shazam. Which is really weird to me, since when they renamed him Shazam in New 52, I think they made it so that he had to *intend* to transform when saying Shazam, so that he wouldn't accidentally change form when saying his own name. But in this movie, just saying his own name transforms him.

Besides, I'm sure the police probably did catch up with her and she probably broke down and said she can't do it, and at that point they probably had her sign the waivers and just tell him that they couldn't find her to spare him the truth until he was ready to handle it.

It’s like they can’t make up their mind on if they want the movies to be connected or standalone. I think DC/Warner Brothers have been killing it with the solo movies, but now it seems like they’re afraid to have the movies be connected because they’ve totally fucked up the team up movies.

They each are a bit better than the others at their specific powers, with Billy being all around stronger in all categories.  In the comics, Pedro (Strength of Hercules) and Darla (Speed of Mercury) are the same as the movies but Eugene gets Wisdom of Solomon.

Billy didn’t feel like the Billy in the comics or animated series, he and his friends were way too cringey and immature, even for 14 year olds. Aside from the youngest girl in the foster family, everyone else should have been a bit more mature and less talkative. Freddy was pretty irritating in my opinion, and Billy was honestly not someone pure of heart at all, and underserving of his powers. I would say Sivana was the greatest part of this movie.ife was pretty unfair for him and I sympathised with him more than any of the other children, compared to Billy who sacrificed a good life in so many foster homes after his Mother who really did not care about him. I was also surprised he did not even bother sharing with the foster homes his desire to find his mother, instead he acts like a dick to almost everyone and yet gets all the praise and powers. I would definitely say this was not on par at all with Captain Marvel, which helped to propel the MCU further into the cosmic realm.",b94c5i

The sins tell him he needs to kill the Champion, cut to him not killing the Champion because he wants to steal his powers. They either needed to put in an extra line about taking the powers way in order to kill him, or have the Sins admonish him for not just ending it which would at least imply it's his own obsession over being rejected that is motivating him.

As it is, it seems just a bit unfocused. I think the script still had too much of the first draft where Black Adam was the villain left over in it, and could've used a couple of rewrites.",b94c5i
ekphwd6,"I understand that. But he already acquired those powers. Destroying Shazam's champion would be the perfect revenge because not only would it prove he was good enough in his mind, it would prove he was better than the one Shazam did choose. Taking his powers doesn't really add anything to his revenge, nor does it add to his own powers since he already has them.

If Sivana had been portrayed as having no powers, or the Sins gave him a different, weaker power set, it would make perfect sense. As it stands, it just kinda comes off as a plot convenience so the villain wouldn't kill the hero right away.",b94c5i

Granted, I've read *Shazam!* comics for the better part of my life, but I've found the criticisms against the \_idea\_ of the Shazam Family odd. Why does he need to fight his own battle by himself? The whole point is that this orphaned kid, who had no one, gets to feel what it's like to \_have\_ someone to care about him. To have a support system. A family. Isn't that what most people - kids or adults - want in life if they don't already have it?

It's a concept that was subtextual in the original 1940s comics, and contextual from the 1990s forward. *Shazam!*, at DC at least, has always been a team book, not a solo book, and *The Marvel Family* was a popular title back when the character was still ""Captain Marvel"" and at Fawcett. The family angle is what sets *Shazam!* apart for me in a world of superheroes and superhero teams - it's a comic about orphaned kids who form an authentic familial bond that extends to their regular lives and their ""superhero"" lives as well. It's also the key thing that sets him apart from Superman - to the point where DC hired Fawcett's key Captain Marvel writer, Otto Binder, to Shazamize Superman and introduce Supergirl, Krpyto the Superdog, and so forth.

His motivations are also not attempting to take over the world, but to make money to support his family (even if that eventually goes too far). Sivana's real purpose of getting back at his father is realized mid-movie and then goes past what most people give a shit about (actual personal strife) to some ridiculous notion of power. I also never really felt like the Marvel family was in danger, moreso when they get their powers, which, again, I'll say happened to soon.

Man...imagine if they went *comics age* accurate Billy and had a younger version have to deal with a mom like that. That would have been even more heartbreaking. 

As for the rest of the movie- Great stuff. Some of the scenes bordered on Joel Schumacher level for my taste though. What was up with the lady doctor in the beginning? 

She felt like she was in a different movie.

But the movie was so self-aware and meta that it *barely* gets a pass for it.

I wish it felt a little less 'aware' that it was a superhero movie, but it was still a great movie overall. 

One major gripe was the villain's backstory. I feel that he had a legitimate grievance with *Billy* being the chosen one since he was indeed a coward for most of the movie. 

Dr. Savana was a kid placed in a terrible situation at a terrible point in his life. Not sure how he got treated fairly.

Sivana has a Magic 8-Ball, Billy has his compass -- they're both victims in this story, they were both discarded and left behind. The narrative is fueled by their (quite literal) search for acceptance, for a place to call home, and the magic that's bestowed upon them only served to mask that pain. It's why Sivana immediately went after his father and brother, it's why Billy wanted to use his powers to prove that he could get by by himself.

Really well done imo. Also maybe it plays into his motivation some: I got the sense that even just finding that place, clawing his way back to the place where the wizard shunned him was a big part of what he wanted.

After he met his mom and realize she was an asshole, he accepts his new family who has been trying to reach out to him. 

&#x200B;

I really liked that aspect because it not only was realistic in terms of how Billy or basically any young person would be in real life if they suddenly got superpowers, and I don't think many superhero films actually let their heroes be so unlikable in a way but at the same time relatable. 

Like for me the big thing is when the villain first catches up with Billy and chases him around to the mall and through the mall, and Billy changes back to his regular self so as not to have to deal with the villain anymore. Who cares about the people that may have still be in jeopardy? 

Or with the bus scene, he does save them, but as soon as they're safe, then he resorts back into jerk mode when almost everyone starts fawning all over him, and he totally forgets that it was his fault that the people on the bus almost died. ",b94c5i

ekcp0j5,"Yeah, safe-haven laws have age limits. Except when Nebraska first put their safe-haven laws into place, they forgot to add an age limit, so there were parents dropping off kids as old as 17. They changed it so now the kid has to be less than a month old.",b94c5i

DC has some interesting superheroes in their catalog that they can play with - WW's movie did fantastic, Aquaman did well, and I have a feeling a Cyborg movie that riffs on the themes of Robocop would be pretty awesome. The Flash is doing well on TV.

They could easily delve into their dark universe and do some Dark Knights material, with someone like Hawkman. Hell, the whole magic angle would work well to get a pairing of Hawkman/Hawkgirl with Shazam.

[When I think back to my childhood, those violent movies that I’m known for now, I didn’t see until I was maybe 12 or 13, and they were on VHS at a sleep-over. The movies that I saw in the theater, when I was 9, 10, 11 and 12, were those scary Amblin movies that were everything to me, like E.T., Raiders, Gremlins, Goonies, Poltergeist, and even Ghostbusters. There were other oddball movies, like Time Bandits, where the kid’s parents blow up at the end and a guy gets turned into a pig. That was mind-blowing, as a child. I had never seen anything like it. And there were other movies, like Dragonslayer, The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth, that were much closer to Grimm’s Fairy Tales, where characters die. They’re very dark stories that aren’t always funny, but those are the movies that were gateway drug movies. Those were the movies that got you into scary movies. Then, you move onto something harder. Now, everyone from the Amblin generation has grown up and has kids, and they want their kids to be into scary movies. What do they show them? They’re showing them Gremlins and Goonies. You can’t start your kid on IT or The Nun. You’ve gotta work your way towards those movies.](http://collider.com/eli-roth-interview-house-with-a-clock-in-its-walls/)

Tone wise it was a little weird. Sometimes it'd be goofy and fun, but there were some scenes that were really dark, and downright grisly (like one of the sins biting that one dudes head off).

For DC comics you can pay the monthly fee of $7.99  to get an entire catalogue of the 20,000 issues from the company’s archives (a lot more just added this april) and every current dc issued comic after a 12 month period when it hit shelves (so you have to wait a year before reading the newest batman if you don't directly buy it) also along with this comes free viewing of alot of DC movies, tv shows and other materials, here's the [link to the website](https://www.dcuniverse.com/). 

For Marvel you can use the Marvel Unlimited service which net you around 25,000+ Marvel Comics for $9.99 and waiting period of 6 months to wait for new issues that hit shelves unlike dc's 12 months, the only thing with marvel is this only comics no other media, so no movies or tv shows with this service from Marvel ( I think disney is gonna launch a separate  service thing for disney stuff which will include the marvel movies and tv). [Link to Marvel unlimited ](https://www.marvel.com/comics/unlimited). 

For general comics buying and standalone stuff, comixology is a good service and they often have sales on a lot of comics, but you have to buy issues individually unless they are packaged together, and they also don't have every issue of a lot of comics and series with you either being stuck waiting for it to be uploaded or never getting it at all, [Link to comixology](https://www.comixology.com/) .
	
But if you want to really do not pay for comics there are also certain sites than you can read a lot of comics online for free, but they require less than dubious morals when it comes to how you can support the comic industry. Im not gonna link them do to not wanting to promote them but if your really not interested in any other option, pm me and I can indulge you with this prefered option instead with the website in question.

Then with BvS, they had Goyer write it again, and this time Snyder had to have Terrio re-write it. And then WB decided to cut a crap ton of important scenes and push an inferior product out to theaters. And then JL? That wasn't Snyder's movie, at all.

Snyder was hampered repeatedly by WB trying to control the movies as much as possible. If Snyder gets the right script and movie, he can make it really good. 300, Watchmen, and Dawn of the Dead are all very good films. He doesn't even need a huge budget. 300 was about the budget of Deadpool, and Dawn of the Dead was half as much, and they were very good.

This movie has so many plot holes, moments of failed levity and issues with character development that your suspension of disbelief is tested and then broken entirely. I agree with your statement about things feeling like tropes. It's definitely all there and not just in your imagination. The movie has no real central theme. There's places in the movie where you know you're supposed to feel bad for the protagonist and yet you don't. It meanders through the story sprinkling things here and there and never giving you a true narrative to follow. It feels like a too-many-cooks scenario.

Remember Ozymandias saying ""To save billions"" after Night Owl screaming at him ""You've killed millions"".

It's cheesy as fuck because the concept of Shazam is cheesy. It's a kid that says Shazam and turns into a magic version of Superman.

ekaotzg,"Yeah but then what if Billy turned out to be evil? It would still have been the wizard’s fault for choosing poorly. There was no indication of Billy being the purest one of them all. The wizard could have just chosen anyone, trained them properly and passed on the powers, OR show how Billy was about to be tempted but he manages to resist it and hence earn his right to be Shazam. 

I felt the directors asked the kids to act like kids rather than characters. There were simply too much dialogue and scenes that were shoved down our throats to say that yes, we are kids, we are immature, we like to make cringey jokes hahahahah. There wasn’t really any uniqueness or character from any member of the foster family, aside from the youngest girl who I felt should have been the only one to be “immature and innocent” since she really is the youngest. The rest of the family was frankly irritating. The Asian kid, freddy, the grown up lady, they seemed forced to act like children rather than be a certain character, with their own style, way of talking, identify. It didn’t feel right.

I don't understand how so many people could have a polar opposite opinion from me about this movie though, which I thought was *awful*. How about when it looks like the bus is about to plummet off a bridge and kill several people, only to be saved by Shazam, who catches the falling bus 6 feet off the ground? Or how about when the ferris wheel starts to fall over, so he turns into Shazam....to forget about the ferris wheel for the next 15 minutes until it becomes convenient to the plot of the fight again.

Or how about how they know they can pull the eye out of the villian to suck in all the 7 deadly sins and win the day, then just put the ball back on the pedestal to protect it. (Along with someone saying, ""See, told you it would work!"")",b94c5i

ekaz4yt,"Honestly, where the movie completely falls flat for me is the villain / serious side, while shining when it comes to being heartwarming and funny. I feel like Billy and the foster family bounce off of one another quite well and it creates a lot of good jokes and uplifting moments. However, the character development feels very forced at times (especially talking about the sudden rift between Billy and Freddy that comes completely out of nowhere) and the villain plot is honestly garbage.

The main villain is extremely one-dimensional with a super weird origin story (gains power by grabbing a ball, which was supposed the be guarded by the last of the seven wizards, who didn’t even make half an attempt to stop him from grabbing the orb in the first place). Speaking of the seven sins: This is a design that looks cool on paper, but falls completely flat when it comes to execution. They look like random monsters from any random horror movie with absolutely no discernible character qualities between the seven of them. It never feels like any of these monsters is actually representing a specific character quality. Lots of missed potential here.

Overall I don’t regret spending the few bucks to see a movie with quite a few enjoyable and funny moments, even though the plot and villain are extremely lacking. ",b94c5i
ek8e5ha,"I don't know if that was directed at me or just generally but I don't inherently hate DC. I loved all of the Dark Knight movies and Watchmen.

To be clear, I've read all of DC's major event titles between the 80s up until Brightest Day. I like a lot of the source material, but the movies are straight trash.",b94c5i

ek5shtk,"I’d argue that it’s just the opposite. Shazam was telling, repeatedly, over and over, that Billy was behaving somewhat selfishly and it was straining his relationship with Freddy Freeman. You could cut 5-10 minutes of the film from that section and lose absolutely nothing of value. At the same time, there were other areas of the film where a little extra focus would have been healthy, such as everything to do with Mary. Her arc just disappears from the film at a certain point and never gets resolved, and she literally disappears for most of the finale. She’s the only member of the Shazam Family to not get a big moment in that fight sequence.

We can argue about the other flaws or lack thereof in Captain Marvel all day, but I’d certainly say that the script is MUCH tighter than Shazam’s. I mean, 20 seconds of dialogue-less characterization vs. a repeated dialogue that explicitly lays out an interpersonal character conflict is the very definition of showing instead of telling. 

I would be interested to know what you thought the unearned character beat was there, however.",b94c5i

eka3945,">Did you complain when they recast red skull in infinity war? That was purely CGI. They didnt spend the money to get the previous actor to return so they managed it another way.

Red Skull is different. In the original Captain America, literally the only other thing in the MCU he's ever in, you only know he's Hugo Weaving when he's not in full Red Skull form. Other than that, it could literally be anybody else in the costume. Weaving didn't define the character for the series.

When I saw Infinity War, I just figured it was Hugo Weaving because really, you can't tell if it is him or not until the credits say it isn't.

Cavill, on the other handed, kicked off this series with his Superman. He's basically this series' Iron Man. He's been in 3/7 movies and Cavill's Superman is a big part of the universe. As far as Superman in this series goes, he is that Superman. Sure, they didn't show this guy's face, so they didn't all out recast him, but it's still weird because you know it's supposed to be Henry Cavill's head on there, but you can't see it. It made it incredibly awkward.

>Not much different you're just hating on DC because.

That's not true. I actually liked Shazam! more than all of the recent MCU films, but that last shot just felt so cheap and lazy to me. The ending would have been fine with just Shazam! showing up there. Even then, if you're going to have Superman, it would be way more impactful for him to show up saying some inspirational catchphrase and cracking a smile, instead of him just randomly walking up.

Look, it's pretty much objective that WB has poorly managed the DC Extended Universe, especially compared to the MCU. The fact that they couldn't get Cavill to appear (whether due to Cavill not wanting to, WB not wanting to fork up the money, whatever it may be) speaks to WB's mismanagement of the property and it shows right on screen.

The Monster Society of Evil (2007)"", and "" Superman/Shazam: First Thunder "". That's for the general gist of the character in terms of tone and how he is as hero, but if you want to read Shazam comics more in line with the movie, you have to read Geoff Johns 2013 New 52 ""Shazam!"" with only one issue released which then continues in the ""Shazam!"" 2019 which is currently on going and is on issue 4 right now ( you probably won't get to read much of it now due to DC's 12 month waiting period on new comics being added to the service), you can buy Shazam 2019 issues as they come out tho if you want to keep up with it, which you might since the current story arc is actually focusing on Dr Sivana, the shazam family as seen in the movies and of course the re-introduction of Mister Mind to comics. Overall have fun reading new comics there a great medium and gald more people are getting to enjoy them through their introduction in movies and TV. 

If you have any other comics character in particular though besides Shazam you want to read on I can recommend other specifics comics if you want. Reply with the specific character and I can give some good suggestions within both DC or Marvel, or even beyond that if you wanna know about some great indie comics ( Like ""Locke & Key"" written by stephen king's son Joe Hill, it's fucking amazing if you ever want to read a good indie comic).

Why did Steve Rogers happen to be chosen for the super soilder program by running in the creator of the serum? 

Why didn't Tony Stark's business partner just hire a hitman to kill him?

Why didn't the lab have better security for their radioactive spiders?

Why didn't Bruce Wayne's parents walk down another street?

Does it really matter? 


The wizard definitely *could have* done a better job. His legacy is marked by failure. Failure in selecting his first champion, failure in containing the sins, failure in finding a ""worthy"" second champion. But ultimately the story isn't about the wizard and his failures.

eke1b5y,"I'm going to disagree with you about the kids but I think that just comes down to a matter of opinion. 

As for the wizard choosing billy, that's exactly the point. The seven deadly sins were released and the wizard was on the verge of death. He could no longer wait and HAD to make a choice. It was a roll of the dice. There was no test, there was no training because it was too late for that. And Billy WAS the wrong choice at first. That was a huge part of his arc. He gained these powers and used them clumsily and for personal gain. But by connecting with his new family through the movie he realizes that his powers should be used for good to protect people.

>Now back to the worrisome news. Apparently the reason behind Snyder's hiring over Aronofsky is, ""the script by David Goyer was rushed, is still a bit of a mess, and that Warner Bros. needs someone who won't spend months or even years trying to get it just right."" Well, that doesn't sound good. This attitude stems from the threat (which we've pointed out previously) that if Warner Bros. doesn't have a new Superman film in production by 2011 (for release in 2012), they'll be subject some unfriendly lawsuits (which could result in losing the character rights to the heirs of Superman creator Jerry Siegel).

For example, I do not like Paul Blart: Mall Cop, but one of my good friends adores it; it's one of his favorite movies ever. So one day I asked him why, and he said that he knows that it's dumb and stupid and not very well made, but he grew up watching it and it takes him back to his childhood and makes him feel like a kid again, laughing at stupid fart jokes and not really paying attention to the plot, just having a good time and feeling like a kid. So thanks to that question that I asked him, I now understand him as a person more and I have a little more respect for Paul Blart: Mall Cop, because it can bring someone joy. If I had just written that off as the bad opinion of someone with bad taste, then I wouldn't have gotten to know my friend better, and I also would have made my life just a little bit more negative and cynical, which is never a good thing.

ek5sjbt,"Bane's death is not on Batman, Catwoman killed Bane.

* Bruce Wayne caused the fire in the League of Shadows causing many shadows to die and even the fake Ras Al Ghul to die when he was asked to kill someone. He caused the entire thing to burn down, so all those deaths are BECAUSE of Bruce Wayne.(Batman Begins)
* Batman asks Gordon to blow up the pillars for the train tracks, fights Ras Al Ghul and traps him in the train, chooses not to save him and excuses his death which he caused by saying ""I won't kill you, but I don't have to save you"". The actual Batman from the comics would see that as a kill, and thats why Batman always goes out of his way to save criminals and bad guys, like how he caught the Joker from falling at the end of TDK. (Batman Begins)
* Batman shoves two-face from shooting the gun, causing two-face to fall along with Batman, ending up being dead. Still he caused Two-Faces death (TDK)
* Batman kills Talia and the driver at the end of TDKR while trying to stop the truck with the Nuke. (TDKR)
* Many scenes in Batman Begins and TDK where Batman just mowed and run over cop cars and bad guys (remember him smashing a garbage truck head on in the tunnel where the truck smashes into the ceiling of the tunnel? )where it is impossible for him to know if those inside those vehicles would survive, it is absolutely impossible for Batman to know that, but Nolan shows that they survive, coz of plot armor. 

You could argue that all these deaths are all self defence or self defence of others, which I would argue was what happened in BvS, he only shot down the mounted vehicles only when those guys started shooting a mounted weapon against Batman, also, Snyder could have chosen the Nolan route and showed an impossible scenario where those guys were alive even after getting exploded, but that would be a huge plot armor just like in the Nolan movies.

ekde7h8,"Idk I think it was not as bad as OP implied, there was no blood really or anything. Imo it was a scene that needed to show how brutal the villain was. It’s definitely the most disturbing in the movie, but it sets the stakes well. 

The argument i’d make though isn’t about how bad a scene is, since it wasn’t out of place for the rating; just maybe the genre, (though certainly not worse than other DC films), is that if you see and age rating and the kid you want to take is **5 years below it**, maybe read a parents guide somewhere. The IMDB one details that scene explicitly and even mentions that it’s out of place for how the movie was marketed. 

The movie also has tons of sexual innuendos and teenage humor as well as a good amount of “shit”s. Idk nothing really seems out of rating for me. ",b94c5i
ekddoh1,"Idk that’s not really the point though. If a movie, even MCU, is rated PG13, and you want to take your 8 year old kid to it, you at least owe it to your kid to read a parents guide on why the rating is what it is. The IMDB guides are great. Personally there are R rated movies that I would have no issue letting my young kids see and there are PG13 movies I wouldn’t even want a 15 year old to go to. It’s a personal thing based on the values you have. ",b94c5i
ekdaawi,"To be fair, the MCU is owned by Disney who holds a very tight restriction on them and rarely allows them to do anything risque (I don't think there's ever even been an f-bomb in a MCU film). They're rated PG-13 because they're heavy action flicks, most action-heavy movies get rated PG-13, regardless of actual content. The MPAA is broken imo. But the MCU films are *very* light pg-13 films, so I wouldn't use them as a way to compare other movies in the same rating. I mean for god's sake, Austin Powers is rated pg-13 and that film is more inappropriate than a lot of R rated films out there.",b94c5i

ek8et5f,"Okay, let's get into it.

Been Affleck, who has dreamed of being Batman his whole career, no longer wants to play the character. His plans to make his own Batman movie also completely fell apart. 

Henry Cavill doesn't want to be Superman anymore. BvS was hacked apart and barely cohesive in the cinematic version. 

Suicide Squad was one of the worst Comic book movies ever made, and half the cast isn't even returning. 

Justice League got mixed reviews, got butchered after Snyder left, and Ray Fisher(Cyborg) was embarrassed to even be in the movie. 

Aquaman did great financially, but the movie was okay at best and isn't really enough to hold together a cinematic universe. Let face it: DC overcompensated for him being a joke, and he's still seen as a joke, as evident by Shazam.

You can go dark and gritty with Superman.  You can't do it with the *first* story in this newest version of him, not if you want to keep going onward.  Like a not, Superhero Movies work best with a lighter tone as the main focus, especially with their Iconic Hero.  Look at Captain America, and how things have one with the Avengers and so on.  They have darkness, certainly with Infinity war... but almost every solo film was decidedly *not* dark, and has a hopeful or uplifting tone to it, particularly with the ever unwavering Cap.  Cavill was fine as him, the problem was the direction and so on.

ekb2uar,"It’s because Shazam was shown he could have and did seek for others to be his champion, on the premise that he or she should be pure of heart. But then he gives to Billy who wasn’t pure of heart. The movie could have at least shown him to be pure of heart: introduce adult Sivana later, so that the orb remains in the Rock. Billy enters and is tested by the orb. However, unlike Sivana, he rejects all of the voices in his head, and continues to talk to the wizard, asking what’s happening. This could then be proof of him being pure of heart.



Also, Unlike all the rest you have mentioned, the circumstances in Shazam aren’t mere accidents. Accidents are at least believable because it can really happen to anyone . Shazam’s powers are not supposed to be an accident. He should have earned it. Cap America earned his right to become the super soldier because he tried again and again to join the army, and he proved to Ershkine that he had a good heart. However, Shazam himself was inconsistent in the choice of his champion, and this led to the creation of a villain, who frankly was more empathetic than the protagonist. It also led an undeserving Billy Batson to gain powers he very well should not have gotten. Yes the wizard is part of the setup, but once the setup is inconsistent, how is the story of Billy believable or good? The circumstances need to be understandable and logical. Billy earning powers that are reserved only for the pure of heart was not fair in the slightest. ",b94c5i
ekjq8a0,"Being a few thousand years old, I would expect that the wizard should have known that maybe someone would return to the rock and steal the sins, or that the sins may escape even without the host. He could have prevented the situation being a roll of the dice if he only chose the champion earlier or prove that Billy had at the very very least, potential to be good. Like a scene where he says” I see goodness in your heart. You may not know it now, you might stray from your path, but know that when you follow your conscience, you will understand your true power.” This can help set up how Billy fails to take responsibility at the start, but eventually learns his lesson to take down Sivana and prove he has heart. Instead, Billy was reduced to being a random chance, when there were so many others who were rejected. It’s simply inconsistent, and I despised inconsistency in such interconnected movie franchises.",b94c5i

el628yd,"Look, I think the thing you're missing is that yes, the actress is 22. But you have to remember that the character she plays is just 17, well below the final developmental age for a woman. So technically, the character of Mary may indeed still be in puberty.

That being said, developmental age needs to be put in perspective. You brought up the point of the peak age in tennis for a woman being 20-21, so I'll start off with sports. That number differs based on the sport and more accurately the amount of quality years they have spent in that sport. For example, say you have a person who started playing competitively at a very young age, and trained recklessly. Their ""peak"" will be much earlier than others who were more careful and knew when to back off (a classic example is Baseball in Japan versus the US). Basically, my point is that no one will really use a single sport as an indicator for ""peak"" physical development, and I advise against it due to the unreliability and inconsistency.

Now when we also look at physical development from a bone density standpoint, it's a well studied and well documented observation that peak bone density in US women (based on population studies) is achieved around when they turn 30 (depending on various genetic and environmental factors).

Now when we look at the peak of sexual maturity (which would bring us back to the discussion of puberty), we have to define what is considered sexual maturity. While there may be varying definitions, many consider a person to have reached sexual maturity to be when they have hit a number of milestones (and the period during which they first hit those milestones to when they hit their last milestone) is considered puberty. These milestones as far as women are concerned include things like breast development, body shape changes, growth spurts, and menstruation. A woman can reach full maturity in their late teens, or even up to their early twenties. It all depends.

And then there is psychosocial development. I'm sure you've heard the thing about people's frontal cortex (the part of the brain that is believed to control rational thought) isnt fully developed until a person hits their mid twenties.

My point in all this is that there are varying perspectives of what ""a developed person"" truly means. But Mary as a character is definitely NOT fully developed, and Grace Fulton, the actress who plays Mary is likely not done growing.",b94c5i
ekaszul,"For Joker comics its hard cause he does not usually get his own mainly hes a featured villain in batman comics, but if you want to read just joker the main ones you wanna read are, 
Paul Dini and Bruce Timm's ""The Batman Adventures: Mad Love"" 1993, this introduces Harley Quinn from the cartoon show of the 90's, she is a popular figure in the joker mythos. ""Arkham Asylum: A Serious House On Serious Earth"" is a trippy look into the Joker's mind through unique art. ""Batman: The Man Who Laughs"" a great overall Joker comic that gives a baseline of main Joker. And of course probably the most well known Joker comic, ""Batman:The Killing Joke"" by Alan Moore, this one most people point too when you wanna read about the joker with good reason, it's the best one and the movie is probably gonna be loosely based on this comic.

While those are all good by themselves comics( as you don't have to read anything prior as you know the base of batman stuff) most good joker stories tend to be in current runs of batman, here are some good ones if your willing to read into that. ""Batman and Robin: Batman Must Die arc"" a general just good joker story from the Batman and Robin 2009-2011 series , its spans Batman and Robin #13, Batman and Robin #14, Batman and Robin #15, Batman and Robin #16 , and crosses over to the one shot Batman: The Return #1. Another one is ""A Death in the Family arc""  from the original Batman run in issues #426–429, this the famous death of Jason Todd the second robin by the hands of joker,  a defining moment for the batman mythos. Gotham Central #12-15 called the ""Soft Targets Arc"" shows the general view of the joker by ordinary people and how gotham cops have to deal with him. 

Another good Joker story takes place in the ""Batman"" run of 2011 called the ""Death of the Family"", bear with me cause this is a long arc that take place across multiple comics and different series, it is 23 issues total and you have to read them in a specific order. The reading order is Batman #13, Batgirl #13, Catwoman #13, Batman #14, Batgirl #14, Catwoman #14, Suicide Squad #14, Batman #15, Detective Comics #15, Batgirl #15, Suicide Squad #15, Batman and Robin #15, Nightwing #15, Red Hood and the Outlaws #15, Teen Titans #15, Batman #16, Detective Comics #16, Batgirl #16, Batman and Robin #16, Nightwing #16, Red Hood and the Outlaws #16, Teen Titans #16, and finally Batman #17. Another good Joker story arc is called ""Batman Endgame"" it's a sequel to ""Death of the family"" and takes place within Vol 2 of Batman series that continues after the 2011 run( so every batman in this reading order is Volume 2), the reading order for that is Batman #36, Batman #37, Batman Annual #3, Batman #38, Batman #39, Detective Comics Endgame #1, Batgirl Endgame #1, Arkham Manor Endgame #1, Gotham Academy Endgame #1, Batman #40. And the final Joker arc I recommended is Is ""Batman: The War of Jokes and Riddles"" which is a cool arc between the riddler and the joker, the reading order is simple for this one is Batman Volume 3(the third Volume in the 2011 series) #25-#32.

Also for good measure I will through in the ""Batman: White Knight"" series, a recent alternate world story that shows what would happen if the joker went sane. And that's all the descent comic recommendation for the Joker I can think of without going to deep in the comic history, some of these may not be yet up on the DC service or may be put in story collections where they simply convert the arc into its own book, if you just type in the story names i'm sure you can find the collected arc books or some of individual parts on the service or on sale somewhere else. Also if I may recommend other media, the batman animated series from the 90s has in my opinion the best rendition of the joker with mark hamill voicing him, watch some good joker eps of the animated series and maybe spin off series of the batman beyond the movie  ""Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker"" which has future batman and joker fight in it. 

On your other characters, I won't go to deep into them because I haven't read that many Punisher or X-men but here some good stories to read from them both. For Punisher read some ""Punisher: Welcome Back, Frank"" by Garth Ennis made in 2000, a good 12 issue series and ""Punisher MAX"" both the 2004 series and the 2010 one. As for X men, again this is a Joker issue where the team itself is stuck into a run and individual comics are hard to recommend because all the good moments are in stuck between a bunch of different issues that need background reading. But if you don't mind skipping some stuff the ""Dark Phoenix Saga"" of the original X-Men of 1963-1968 is great and takes place between #129-137, and the The Uncanny X-Men issues #141–142 showcase a great arc called ""Days of Future Past"". Some good X-men comic runs besides the general original X-men comic are ""New X-Men"" from 2001 - 2004 and ""Astonishing X-Men"" from 2004 - 2013. For X men comics that differ from the typical teams seen in the original x men runs, i'm a huge fan ""The New Mutants, vol. 2"" a 13 issue series from 2003-2004 that stars students from professor xavier's school acting as the main cast instead of the typical x-men characters, they later got turned into the series called ""New X-Men: Academy X"" then later called just ""New X-men"" from 2004 - 2008, good run would recommend a lot.

Well if you looking for any more recommendations just ask, and if your looking something more specific when you said X-men like a certain character tell me and recommend specific issues if you want. Either way have fun reading bud. 

Also on another note if you confused on the some story arcs in comics, and wanna read a specific  one its best just type that arcs name in google then type reading order, like ""Batman: Death of the Family Reading Order"" should just give you a list on how to read specific arcs. Also what I mean by runs and series is just the general comic itself  from issue #1 to whatever the last issue number is, that means when I say Astonishing X-Men from 2004 - 2013 I just mean reading the whole the comic in total.",b94c5i
ekba2vg,">Unlike all the rest you have mentioned, the circumstances in Shazam aren’t mere accidents.

From Billy's perspective might as a well be. He even says as much. The Wizard was also not looking for Billy in particular. He's just who showed up. What's the option, just sit there die, waiting for a champion that never comes *after* the sins have already been unleashed upon the world?

>Shazam himself was inconsistent in the choice of his champion, and this led to the creation of a villain, who frankly was more empathetic than the protagonist. It also led an undeserving Billy Batson to gain powers he very well should not have gotten.


You are right, but that's the point. The perfect hero doesn't show up in this story. That would pretty cool if they had decided to go for a more classic Captain Marvel. This ends up being a different kind of story, less ideal, but no less *good*. The reason Sivana is sympathetic is that he's kinda right. The wizard was probably never going to find a ""worthy"" champion, not before the sins broke free. Maybe he should have picked Sivana. The wizard is flawed,his selection process flawed. Ultimately he fails and the sins do break free. Using Sivana as their tool.


>Billy earning powers that are reserved only for the pure of heart was not fair in the slightest.

It seems like this might be the root of our disagreement. 

The powers of the wizard Shazam are *not* reserved for the pure of heart. That is just the criteria that the wizard was looking for. He's being picky out of fear of what happened to the last champion. Ultimately he doesn't find *exactly* what he was looking for in time. Shazam puts his faith in Billy because he is his last *hope*. This is a leap of faith, not a decision made on logic or reason. Unlike 
Sivana, he does not immediately dismiss Billy for his flaws, maybe he took some of what the doctor said to heart. Shazam *hopes* that the good in Billy will shine through. He hopes but he doesn't know. Billy for his own part doesn't understand any of this. Only latter does he start the process of becoming better. Of being reaching his potential for good. Even by the end of the movie his isn't totally there yet, but he's started the journey. Whether you think that is worthwhile story is up to you.

Like I said, Endgame will be out soon, and will probably be much more your speed. As it is, Shazam isn't really about big flashy super battles. Of course Sivanna's not as awesome to watch as Thanos throwing an entire moon at Iron Man. But it's not the same kind of movie. It's about a kid getting superpowers when he doesn't exactly deserve them, then learning, in the words of a certain uncle, that with great power comes great responsibility.

For a wizard who has lived for thousands of years, seen so much conflict in the world and had the experience of bringing up an evil champion, I would have expected him to plan properly and choose a truly worthy hero. The circumstances of the entire movie was the fault of the wizard, whose failures were never mentioned again despite being of grave consequences to the entire lore of Shazam in general. A movie, situated in a universe with so many different characters and stories, should have a rock solid premise that isn’t just written so that the protagonist can get powers for no reason other than he was a “last minute choice”, because frankly there were other choices. This isn’t an incident with gamma radiation or a radioactive spider, or being unlucky for going down the wrong alley at night, or being captured by terrorists hired to kill you, this movie should have at least showed Billy Batson having the potential to do good, and that the wizard managed to see that in him, but instead it was reduced to Billy being the last option, which is the definition of lazy writing. The lack of planning on the wizards part is a very very significant deviation from the comics, in which a truly worthy Billy Batson manages to shine with the cheeriness and innocence that this movie could have shown but didn’t. Instead the movie had to make him and Freddy act like dicks to each other over such trivial things that the tonal shift between that and when Sivana arrives was extremely jarring and didn’t flow well. 


I would have preferred a Billy Batson who was affirmed by Shazam to have a pure heart, maybe not at that moment, but the wizard can see the potential in him, and gives him guidance to always follow his heart and never be let astray, similar to what Erskhine said to Cap. Then the movie can still go on, but this time I want a more upright Billy, someone who can voice his ideals and stand up for everyone else, even more so than he did in the movie. The only scene that showed this was when he saved Freddy from the bullies. We needed more scenes that captured this same essence, not the constant childish bickering that didn’t really mattered to the plot. Then, when true evil in the form of Sivana confronts him, he is slowly tempted by the sins to join their side. We could have a devil vs angel scene depicting Billy’s inner conflict, and see where his true heart lies, with goodness and family or evil and power.

ekilqpe,"I liked it enough. I think critics liked it. But it wasn't amazing. It was a mediocre movie with moments here and there. 

You're a moron for thinking WB wouldn't manipulate Reddit comments lol",b94c5i

ek5u2pc,"Wait, you think it makes a difference to the comic Batman if it's a common thug, paramilitary, mercenary or his rogues gallery that deserves killing? 

Also, to your ""common thug"" and two-Face, we as an audience know who two-face is, Batman in TDK doesn't know how much of a criminal Two-Face is or will become. In TDK, we maybe see Two-Face kill 3-4 ""common thugs"" and 0 innocent lives. In the scheme of things, those mercenaries in BvS are way worse than Two-Face in TDK.

So, I don't know what your argument is.",b94c5i
