d9l3x5t,"I don't get emotional at movies. I sit through most of them stone faced, hell I didn't even shed a tear at the end of Marley & Me. Hacksaw Ridge made me cry. 

Mel Gibson did a very good job at showing the harshness of Doss's world, from the beatings of his father to the hellscape on top of the ridge. It would be so easy for Doss to succumb to this violent, thuggish place. But he doesn't. He just saves people and something about the strength of his resolve and the purity of his intentions really struck a cord with me. When Capt. Glover describes Doss as the ""bravest man he ever met"" during the credits I just lost it. It's been a very long time since a movies done that to me. Actually I think the last time was when I saw Braveheart for the first time.

Glad to have you back, Mel. ",5b10qo
d9l3ek0,"I knew the violence was coming. I knew this movie was going to be brutal, but when the battle finally started I still wasn't ready.",5b10qo
d9ma53r,"How did this movie only have a budget of $40 million with all the names in the cast, much less the battle scenes ?",5b10qo
d9l1l68,"I really liked Hacksaw Ridge. It was edited so well and each actor did an amazing job. 

The dinner scene when Desmond's parents find out his brother has enlisted was so well done. Hugo Weaving as Thomas Doss was perfect. 

I think one of the most moving parts was when he came down and was walking through everyone in silence.

Loved it loved it loved it.",5b10qo
d9mmcdq,"The final battle sequence was so well done. Not the visceral moment-to-moment intensity of the previous battles but rather a montage of violence shot with extreme beauty. Like that shot where the camera seemed attached to the back of the rifle as it fired.

Also very glad to see a Christian movie done right. Not a cheesy story where religion is the primary focus but rather a film with a dramatic arc and a legitimate character piece displaying how his belief helped him achieve something beyond himself. As a Christian myself it felt great to see that depicted so well here. ",5b10qo

d9mh5re,"Did it bother anyone else they didn't mention/show brother after dinner scene.

Mel is one hell of a filmmaker.",5b10qo
d9kxfu2,Seeing Vince Vaughn in a more serious movie scared me at first but every time he was on screen he killed it. Such a good fit ,5b10qo
d9lceae,Man I read one of the negative reviews linked on RT and the reviewer is whining about the violence in the film and how it's not necessary for a war movie. Apparently a war movie about an unarmed medic shouldn't show just how gruesome it is.,5b10qo
d9kxff5,It's rare that a movie can come across as inspiring and uplifting despite being one of the most violent films in recent years. Mel Gibson balanced the two wonderfully. ,5b10qo
d9l3lon,I think the dude at the very opening of the movie who is yelling over him being carried was Mel Gibson himself. Can't be sure though!,5b10qo
d9mm860,"Wow. The part where Desmond is telling the story of the moment he took the vow to never pick up a gun again (with violent intent?) really resonated with me. I know what it's like to some extent to hold certain beliefs that are irrational to most others that are based upon rough patches early years of life. I think others might have found it corny during the explanation when he says ""but I killed him in my heart"" but that line was very powerful to me. Great movie with a lot of interesting things to think about.",5b10qo
d9kzjo9,The movie was fucking amazing. It was so brutal and yet very uplifting. I got pretty emotional when he roped himself down and started walking while everyone was staring at him.,5b10qo

d9kx8gs,"Andrew Garfield for Best Actor, get hype.",5b10qo
d9mbyh8,"It's only been 24 hours, but man, I cannot get this film out of my head.

Incredible acting, insane action scenes, and it sticks with you.  Mel Gibson probably won't be nominated for Best Director (or the film for Best Picture), but that would be a huge shame.  A fantastic achievement and look at one of America's unsung heroes.

Bravo.",5b10qo
d9l4aqz,"Just got out of a showing. God damn if that isn't one of the most brutal, inspiring, jaw-dropping, tear-jerking movies I have ever seen in my life. Those battle scenes matched up and even surpassed those of Saving Private Ryan. 


The acting was superb, and Mel continues to show how to show that he will remain one of the most dominant directors in Hollywood. Really puts our lives in perspective. 

As I walked out of the cinema, I thought to myself, ""Why do I get to walk out of the cinema, with my friends, chatting about anything, free to do whatever?"" These men sacrificed show much for this country and it makes me proud to say I'm a goddamn American. 

P.S. That scene when the Japanese pulled a grenade pin and grabbed a soldier and wouldn't let him go until they just started screaming at each other was fucking terrifying. ",5b10qo
d9kzmlg,"Andrew Garfield was great. The first battle sequence without any score was very powerful, and the rest of the battle sequences were intense and terrifying. The first half of the movie was very inspiring and made you feel for Doss' character. Another great turn from Mel Gibson",5b10qo
dao7ov8,"Ok someone help me out here.... Movie fanatic like everyone else, but I thought this was horrible! I do not get the love.

Garfield was terrible (at the beginning when he was talking to the nurse, more like just staring, I thought he was suppose to be mentally retarded).  Vaughn was terrible, but you cant blame him.  I guess you cannot spend 15 years making schoolboy comedies and be taken seriously (See also True Detective Season 2).

Half the movie was this DUMB love story with little substance that included anything rewarding/original.  Why couldn't that first hour be told in 20 mins? Couldn't we get to war action a little sooner??

Ive seen plenty of Mel Gibson movies and I know the importance and symbolism of Catholicism involved, but some of the imagery here was comical.  

Finally, what was the more ridiculous scene: 
(a) Andrew Garfield slapping a grenade out of the air in slow motion 
or (b) Jeremy Grey from Wedding Crashers, I mean Vaughn, being dragged out of battle like a child on a sled, shooting away? 

In all seriousness, someone please explain to me why this is getting some great reviews, and dare I say, being included in Oscar talk. What am I missing?

d9kxk7w,Oscar material on several categories. ,5b10qo
d9l0fi8,"the beginning of the first battle with guy rising up and screaming =scariest scene of 2016

a great movie, probably the best of 2016 so far. i wish there were more battle scenes tho",5b10qo
ddpzmxi,"Man, these movie discussion threads do a great job of ruining my enjoyment of any movie. I saw Hacksaw and thoroughly loved it. Yes, its not flawless but the sheer display of courage and persistence that Mel Gibson managed to portray was nothing but spellbinding. I legitimately started tearing up at ""Please Lord, help me get one more"" scene. I really don't understand the hate that's being spewed here.",5b10qo
d9lqcjv,Just finished watching this. Has multiple Oscars written all over it. What a hero that man was.,5b10qo
d9l36hl,"The bit where Desmond was patching up the Jap in the tunnel was terrific. Just the raw emotion and compassion Garfield portrayed in this movie alone was fantastic.

Amazing cinematography, beautiful story telling, and likable characters (and character arcs!). If this doesn't get at least a few Oscar noms, I will be surprised.

This is honestly in my top 5 of 2016, for sure.",5b10qo
d9l4g5s,Easily some of the best war scenes I've seen in a long time. I was genuinely afraid at certain times. It was intense.,5b10qo

d9mfpr9,"Everything I thought that would be horribly preachy and cheesy during the trailers was actually dead-on amazing in the context of the film. Walking back to my car after the showing tonight, I had to just stop and choke back a dry sob and breathe. I was unexpectedly overwhelmed with emotion and the visceral impact of what I'd just seen. It wasn't a perfect 10 for me, but goddamn, it got me.",5b10qo
dbmiktm,"Too much emotional manipulation for my liking. Just tell us what happened, not how to feel too.",5b10qo
dc8n7ur,"Wow I was simply amazed by this film.  Truly inspiring and amazingly directed.  Maybe one of my favorite WW2 films.

Interesting reading the comments, seem to be the usual hate on Mel Gibson that he's a Christian propagandist.

I'm as atheist as they come, but you have to admit that this man's faith helped him to endure true hell and be a true man and hero in such a difficult time.  It still doesn't make me believe in God, but it's powerful none the less.

Sure, there were some 'ok he's Jesus' shots like in most Mel Gibson movies, but that's just his thing.  I accept it, and honestly, I need it every now and again.  Jesus is an archetype after all.  The savior.  People get so mad at it (see the Matrix 3 hate), but it's one of the oldest archetypical characters we have in story telling.

I don't understand the criticism I read that the enemy were faceless japanese soldiers.  So what, it's a movie about an American soldier.  Also, he helped out a Japanese soldier who was truly shocked and moved by his act of humanity.  

Movie was moving as shit, fucking bad ass, and an awesome addition to the WW2 movie genre.  And it does something different which is to glorify not a soldier who kills, but a medic who is a conscientious objector.

I give it 5/5 stars.  Mel Gibson, once again, makes a bad ass movie.
",5b10qo
d9m43xw,"The 3 seconds of the front lines just going at it. Good God what a strangely beautiful shot.

Unlike people in my party, I also really liked how it ended with him being lifted out on a stretcher at the ridge with a slight smile and look of relief on his face. It didn't show him being welcomed home as a war hero being paraded or being given pats on the back by the people who hated him because that's not why he went to the front lines. He did it cause he felt convicted to help and he was just fine where he was. I really liked that last shot when he was lifted out (as weirdly digital as it looked). It felt like he was having one more moment with his God.",5b10qo

d9nb9jw,"Of course the war portion of the movie was incredible, but was anyone else impressed by the love story? The chemistry between those two was excellent and I was smiling the whole time they were falling in love. Hacksaw Ridge: Best Romantic Comedy of 2016. ",5b10qo
d9kznwk,"Just saw this and I thought it was great. It is violent, but I didn't find it gratuitous. Mel Gibson really does a fantastic job ramping up the tension; I was captivated and on edge for pretty much the entire film. The battle scenes are intense, the number of people killed is horrifying, yet Doss's courage is inspiring. The movie is really emotionally impactful. Probably my favorite film of the year so far, I highly recommend it.",5b10qo
d9l1qx0,So apparently we're not getting this in Norway. Guess I'll have to resort to other means 😡,5b10qo
ddt9hef,"I had mixed feelings in the first half, but the second half really made my jaw drop on how well done that part was made. I think after I remembered that this was a true story, it made me enjoy it more because that's just incredible. I usually don't get emotional with movies, but when the captain apologized and at the end where they show footage of them in real life, I was shedding some tears. 

Although the weaker point was definitely the first half, i did enjoy the depiction of the dad, and the scene where he learns the first son enlisted was stellar. The love story seemed a little rushed but I'm not sure what else they could do with the time they had. But I was able to forgive all the problems from the first half because the war part was just so moving to me ",5b10qo
d9mklpb,"So I'm clearly in the minority on this, but I thought the movie was only good, not great. I wasn't a fan of the first hour; it was full of clichés and came off as really corny during some scenes. It was pretty unremarkable in the way the characters and relationships were set up. The second half of the movie though was incredible and made up for most of the flaws in the first half of the film. The battle sequences were really, really, well done (although the Omaha Beach sequence in Saving Private Ryan is still the best in terms of war battles being depicted in film). Of course, the performances were all great as well. I'm surprised at how much I liked Vince Vaughn (I've pretty much hated almost every movie he's been in the last ten years), granted, I thought he was overacting a bit during the training scenes at the camp, but he eventually grows into his part once the Hacksaw Ridge scenes start. It's a shame we didn't get to see more of Hugo Weaving, thought he was fantastic, but once the guns start firing, we never get to see him again (same with Rachel Griffiths and Teresa Palmer). And then there's Andrew Garfield, who, for some reason, seemed like an odd choice to me, but he was quite good. Overall, I give it a 7/10. Had the first part of the film been better, my rating would have been much higher, but as it stands, this is a solid war film that requires some patience to get to the good stuff. 

And to just put it out there: I thought this was much better than Passion of the Christ, but nowhere near as good as Braveheart. I’d put this on the same level as Apocalypto.

daqcv0j,It was so hard to watch this movie then come back to my college campus where students are burning American flags (which is their right) because of a presidential election result.,5b10qo
daj7pzj,Combat vet here. Iraq and Afghanistan. Nothing like.this movie. It seriously and honestly choked me up and my whole body was tense. I would honestly call the second half of this movie a HORROR war drama or whatever you want to call it. The hellish quality of the ridge when they first get up there then the slaughter that occurs. Nothing else like it. This is the Saving Private Ryan of the Pacific Theater and I would argue is MORE intense. ,5b10qo
d9m4d11,"I've watched a lot of war films and this is the first since Saving Private Ryan to make me grip my seat as hard as I did. That first battle was incredibly well made.  Unnerving and disgusting level of intensity.  War is so fucked up.

Can't really think of anything ""wrong"".  Just wish it had a longer ending.  Would've liked to have seen him come home to his wife.  The first half had me rolling me eyes sometimes at their relationship but I can't say they weren't cute as hell together.  Really good chemistry.

Hugo Weaving gave a downright perfect performance.  That dinner scene was so damn emotional. Dat lip quiver.  And Vince Vaughn was so damn good.",5b10qo
dau21te,"Saw this on a Monday afternoon a month after it came out. I was the only one in the theater. This ended up being a good thing, since I audibly screamed out ""Holy Shit"" at least three times during the battle scenes.

So far as concerned, it's the best war movie since Saving Private Ryan. It might have surpassed it even...I'll need time to reflect on the movie before I go that far.",5b10qo
d9kxzy9,"I just want to preface by saying that I absolutely loved the movie, and it was one of the most satisfying theater experiences I've had in a while. It was worth every dollar. I absolutely loved the performances and the end where we had the privelege of hearing from the people that were actually involved. The movie would've felt incomplete without that. I do want to mention one thing, though. Although I have absolutely no problem with it, the gore in this movie is very intense and anatomically realistic. Some people may may even say it was overdone, though I thought it helped create a stark contrast from the first half of the movie and gave a look at the horror of WWII combat. I mention this purely to say that people planning to see this movie with combat veterans should take that into consideration if they feel it might be an issue. The Normandy beach scene is rather tame compared to the greater part of this movie. All in all, I give the movie a solid 9/10.",5b10qo
d9m9l94,One of the few movies that I can confidently rate a 10 / 10 on IMDB. I walked away from the theater wondering why was I just now hearing about this story? It was amazing! ,5b10qo
ddljq4y,"This has to be said. Some of these comments are just embarrassing, does no one research anything before they spew out random nonsense? For everyone who laughs at the body shield scene, that's serious morbid, only for the fact that that exact scene happen in real life. If you read some of the books on him, and watch some interviews, there are SEVERAL eye witness accounts and statements proving that happened, and stating it happened that exact way. But ignorance is bliss. Although several of you trolls are gonna say whatever you want and make up whatever you want to prove your point so keep that in mind all other rational educated others who know what they're taking about. That scene with the grenades also happened, On the night of May 21, 1945, just a half mile past the escarpment on Okinawa, Desmond's unit inadvertently walked into a company of Japanese soldiers. The unit engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy and Desmond scrambled to treat the wounded. ""They begin to throw these hand grenades,"" recalled Desmond. ""I saw it comin'. There was three other men in the hole with me. They were on the lower side, but I was on the other side lookin' when they threw the thing. I knew there was no way I could get at it. So I just quickly took my left foot and threw it back to where I thought the grenade might be, and throw my head and helmet to the ground. And not more than half a second later, I felt like I was sailin' through the air. I was seein' stars I wasn't supposed to be seein', and I knew my legs and body were blown up."" The blast left 17 pieces of shrapnel embedded in Desmond's body, mostly in his legs. Ever nitpick you all have is disproved if you actually do some damn research, and wether you like it or not boys, this is the new SPR, so get used to it.",5b10qo

ddcqzwp,"Scrolling through the comments, I see a lot of people that are let down and disappointed by the film. I'm not one for 'war movies', I don't think i've ever seen a war movie in my life. But i'm on a quest to see all 9 movies nominated for best picture so this was 5/9 for me. It was amazing, I think. I cried at least twice, I was inspired and moved. Maybe i'm just not familiar with Mel Gibson's other works or war movies in general, or i'm not too much of a history buff so I didn't spot any inaccuracies. I came here looking for at least a few people who shared my opinion but I didn't find it lol",5b10qo
d9l8vz2,"Such a powerful film, there were many moments that gave me chills and made me tear up. It's a shame I didn't know about Desmond Daas until tonight.

As for Mel Gibson, he really knocked it out of the park with those action sequences especially the first one. It genuinely disturbed me and impacted me in a way no war film ever has. It felt like Spielberg's famous Normandy scene from Saving Private Ryan but with more of a personal touch to it. This is definitely one you shouldn't miss this year and a big contender for the Oscars on many levels. Very solid and surprising performances from the entire cast.

I only have one flaw and it's that the ending felt too sudden. I wanted to see Daas reunited with his wife one more time before it went to black. Seeing the obvious CGI in the end took me out for a moment and left me just a little bit disappointed. Overall though, best film of the year. Congrats to Mel, Garfield, and the entire cast, this is a very special and rare film.",5b10qo
d9mdzzd,"I just came back from watching the movie. Holy balls, was that first battle scene was so intense. I caught myself looking away once because a guy got his legs absolutely blown off. I'm more surprised he lived after that.

I thought the opening sequence was pretty crazy and Mel was just warming up. I'm a huge war movie buff and I have to say, this was one of the most insane, if not the craziest war film I've seen. Like I jumped a couple times. When they were going up the ridge the first time, in my mind I was like ""fuuuuuuck"" because in that artillery barrage I thought nothing could've lived in those blasts.

It absolutely took me by surprise on how the Japanese didn't give a single fuck.

I actually want to go see it again later tonight. It was unbelievable.",5b10qo
db75s7r,"Late to the party on this movie, but I just saw it in mid December 

Are you all seventh day adventists or religious extremists? I'm convinced there is a fantastic underground guerrilla PR campaign for this movie on the internet.

This movie was terrible. There's no concept of any sort of tactics in any battle scene. The shots of flaming bodies flying all over the pace don't make any sense. The artillery ""shelling"" just looks like special effect charges. I could go on and on.

Vince Vaughn being carried on a blanket shooting Japanese left and right! What?

Compare to any battle scene from band of brothers or saving private Ryan to see how incredibly unrealistic this all was.

The best parts of the moving were the interviews of the protagonist and his comrades at the end. A shame for them to have their story told this way.",5b10qo

da2bfjg,"This film hurts my heart.  I feel that on one hand its great that a film of honest conviction and sentiment has graced our time, but on the other hand, I understand that this same sentiment and virtue is wasted on a corrupt generation.

Most people my age would think that the views expressed in this film are quaint, silly, and that all angles should be viewed with personal incredulity; from the Sergeant to Doss it seems like this film would be better received by an audience from 40 or 50 years ago. 

We live in an age when beliefs, conscience, and conviction are treated as jokes and derided by the culture en masse.  Such as it is, I can't help but feel contempt for my peers.  I don't want to feel like this.  This doesn't come from a place of self-righteousness, it comes from a place of grief.

I wish more time was given to the guys in Doss' unit, they are basically introduced in the barracks scene and that's it. There was possibly too much time spent on the love plot, I went to on a pee/beer run during it and don't feel like I missed anything, could be wrong though.

The combat was absolutely gruesome and incredibly well done. There is nothing romantic about it. Doss is a hero and that came across well in the movie.

Overall really liked it, but my mind wasn't blown like I was expecting it to be. I am very glad to see Mel Gibson back in the director's chair.",5b10qo

da2ksfa,"Mel Gibson can't help himself. Goes hard with the religious theme for like an hour of the movie. Instead of focusing on Doss learning medicine he spends all of his screen time on this ideological theme that feels like what a pastor would talk about in a church sermon.

Then he goes hardcore with the violence to the point where it's ridiculous. I'm not squeamish when it comes to violence but the part where that meathead GI-Joe picks up a fallen comrade and uses him as a human shield.... it's almost disrespectful at that point. I get it's important to understand how horrific the battlefield can be, but you can't spend an hour of the film talking about god and being a pacifist, then spend another hour glorifying brains exploding, eviscerations, and burning Japs doing flips.

Hey and what's up with Vince Vaughn's second rate impression of Lee Ermy. The casting didn't make sense to me. Wtf was that dumb shit where He was dragged on a rug while he sprayed and prayed behind him with a Grease gun with pin point accuracy and never having to reload. Ya, nobody every reloaded in this movie.

Also what's up with all the guys  Desmond was in boot camp with. There's a guy from Brooklyn, and Italian, and some dude named Tex. All the side characters seemed very cheap take on classic war movies. 

Oh what about the end scene. The ending seemed super rushed to me. Sooooo he plays handball with a grenade and gets pulled off the battlefield and at the same time they take the ridge, by the way the Japs surrender too and they commit sepeku. All while the generic score of the movie is blasting over all the dialogue. He get elevated on this ghetto gondola being made to look like a religious figure and the movies over. What about the entire half of the movie where they create the relationship with his wife and she is like ""you better come back to me,"" and they don't even include their reunion. What a waste. Just so Mel can have his gorefest fetish appeased. He's an Old Testament sort of guy isn't her!?

I feel like only Desmond's character was fleshed out enough. Everyone else's character was just a shallow stereotype. For all the qualms I have with this film, I still really enjoyed it because the battle sequences largely mitigate the flaws to an extent. They are legitimately terrifying and my jaw was dropped for the entire duration. I even screamed a few times. If those scenes weren't nearly as intense, this film would get a 5/10.

The action is masterfully crafted, those action sequences are some of the most intense yet technically brilliant I have seen in a while. 

The whole cast gives 100% from Andrew Garfield's Oscar winning performance to Hugo Weaving's heart wrenching display to every young male actor from Australia working today not named Hemsworth.

But the main reason that I loved it was that it emotionally impacted me. I needed a couple of minutes at the end to compose myself before I left the theater.

If you have to pick between this and Doctor Strange (which is also great) I would recommend going to see Hacksaw Ridge.

d9n7hie,"Didn't like it very much, but there are a few redeeming qualities. Disappoints me that I thought that since most here seem to be loving it. First half was unforgivably cheesy and jingoistic, like a Norman Rockwell painting deprived of life. Every scene is lazily shot and directed up until they go to war. Most scenes were just medium shots and inserts, even in scenes that could have been potentially very interesting like mountain climbing or boot camp. 

But Jesus, some of those war sequences are to die for. They're over the top and obvious but *exciting* as all get out. If Gibson brought the same level of enthusiasm and invention to the interpersonal scenes as he did to the carnage, this film could have been special. 

P.S. Disappointed with the way this film handled the Japanese. Every American soldier got a death that was either incredibly gory to the point that you felt their loss or noble enough to make them feel like heroes, while the Japanese were picked off like flies. I get that they were the enemy but the message of this film is that violence is always bad no matter what direction it goes in. Felt contradictory.",5b10qo
d9l4ghs,The only complaint I have about the film is that it ended. ,5b10qo
ddm2nqw,"So during the first 20 minutes or so, my sister and I were laughing at how bad this movie was. The ""love story"" was so rushed- it felt like after their third date she was asking him to propose. I know they were setting up background but I think they could have skipped the courtship or instead of rushing through it, just showed him already in love by the time we meet him as an adult. I felt zero connection to their story. 

I also thought he was supposed to be slow. We were laughing at his early conversations with his wife ""I need my blood back"" ""I need my belt but it's over there.."" ""it's five miles but I walk through the woods and it's seven"" I would have been truly creeped out by him. I thought maybe the brick to his head did real damage - it was just odd. 

His dad was a flat character- the typical ""drunk"". When he gives the letter during the court marshal, was that his turn around? Were we supposed to love him then? Why is the dad so comforting to the girlfriend? Is he suddenly nice? I again was unmoved by that relationship.

The characters in basic training were so stereotypical. We felt like they just picked nicknames and accents from every region/ethnic group. There's Tex! He has a lasso. There's New York Italian kid, he's small but feisty! Look- it's chowder, our Boston friend!

Vince Vaughn? Just a poor pick. I love him but I can't see him in this role. He took me out of the movie.

However! Once we were in war, I liked it. What an amazing story. He's a courageous hero and I had never heard of him. I liked the battle scenes as gory as they were - war is gory. I want to read a book on his story now. And I loved how he even sent down a few Japanese soldiers.

If we could redo the beginning of the movie I think this would be a strong contender. But the flat stereotypical actors, Garfield's ""is something wrong with him?""  courtship, and everything before the war really killed it for me. ",5b10qo

d9motc3,"Very good movie, I was a bit concerned about the acting from the trailer but Garfield did a good job. The fighting was absolutely brutal to watch. The most incredible thing I found was that Doss's deeds were even greater in real life than they were in the movie! Seriously go read his medal of honor citation, the movie didn't quite fit in his full measure of heroism",5b10qo
d9nqyrj,"I've been in for more than a year now, and I just got out of a showing about an hour ago. 

This movie made me feel every emotion. I was grinning like an idiot along with Desmond when he fell in love, I was laughing when Vaughn was reaming his soldiers to shreds, I was on the edge of my seat during every fight, I was frightened at the jumpscares, and I cried when I saw the real Desmond Doss at the end talk about when he poured his canteen out on the other guy and the other guy said ""I thought I was blind!"" I could never imagine what all of that was like.

And then a woman tapped me on the shoulder and started talking to me, Christian to Christian, and she told me her name was Yolanda, I think she asked me if I had been there or not (i can't exactly remember), I told her I hadn't, but I told her my name and what I'm doing, and she shook my hand and told me good luck. Tonight was an incredible experience, and a humbling one, stemming from such an amazing story of a man saving 75 men from that godforsaken ridge. 

Mad props to Mel, Andrew, Vaughn, and especially Hugo.",5b10qo
d9nwlbw,"I'm a little perplexed as to the complaints about the violence in the film. While I do think that a couple of sequences were too Hollywoodized, I don't think the film as a whole romanticized violence. I thought the battles were terrifying. It really showed the absolute horror of war. Also, any battle in the Pacific theater is going to showcase some of the worst fighting in WWII. I don't know how you're supposed to tell Desmond's story without showing lots of blood and gore. When you listen to the stories from the vets that were at Hacksaw Ridge that's the carnage they described: people getting limbs blown off, getting disemboweled, decapitations, and even people being torn in half because the machine gun fire was so thick.

Here's a heartwarming fact. The real man that got both legs blown off that was saved by Desmond survived the war and lived to be 72. ",5b10qo

I appreciated seeing how Doss came to his beliefs and his dorky romance was funny and heartwarming to watch. The boot camp was also great Vince Vaughn played an excellent drill seargant nasty but his acting was able to humanize something that would be normally one note. Hugo Weaving had a fantastic performance as a drunk abusive father. His character was an asshole but was mixed with enough tragedy and gruff heroism in his own right to make him a compelling character.

Holy shit the second half of the film was insane. The violence was brutal and Mel Gibson is not subtle or chickens out with the carnage. The whole second half was gruesome easily topping any war movie when it comes to depicting the horrors of war. It's juxtaposed neatly with the quiet heroism of the pacifist medic Doss. I enjoyed seeing throughout the first day of battle seeing Doss winning over his former detractors and bullies as he was right there in the front lines. The act where he pretty much saved what was left of the company single handily was flat out insane. The whole battle sequence was tense and gruesome. At the end I thought Hacksaw Ridge was a great comeback for Mel Gibson. It was well directed and well acted, Garfield deserves an oscar nomination for his performance. The story was also novel for a war movie, as it was interesting to see the quiet heroism of the pacifist Desmond Doss.",5b10qo
d9ndud1,"I saw this movie back in September at a NY BAFTA Screening and also met Andrew Garfield.

This biopic, Hacksaw Ridge, broke me. Never has a film put me through so much horrors, so much excruciating pain since 2013’ 12 Years A Slave. I can cry in movies, I had my fair share but, this made me feel a way I haven’t felt in a film in a long time. It is one of those films that makes you want to get a drink afterwards to think about your life. I had to get a drink of water because I couldn't take the violence for after a while. I started breathing so hard and hyperventilating to a point I feared I was gonna pass out. Believe it or not, this film doesn’t only display the brutality that is war, but it also emphasizes one man’s heart and humanity.

d9ou7qf,"For anyone who saw and enjoyed the movie, I highly recommend the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Medic-Miracle-Hacksaw-Ridge/dp/1492898562). Gibson's film does a surprisingly good job of mirroring the real-life story, with some obvious artistic liberties taken (Doss was drafted; he volunteered in the film, which inevitably created a continuity error as it was never explained in great depth *why* he chose to join up. There was a brief explanation, but it was more of a showing than a telling). 

The battle on Okinawa was visceral and gut-wrenching, while artful - as is Gibson's style. The first act drags a tad but the film *roars* into its second half and emerges as something totally different. Does it have issues? Sure, but the whole is ultimately greater than the sum of its parts.

You don't need to be a pacifist or a Christian or even a fan of Gibson's films to enjoy it. Just mentally prepare yourself, subsequently accept that no matter what you do you won't be fully prepared, and see it.",5b10qo
d9q6gk1,Sam Worthington laying a man on top of a live grenade and riding the explosion was one of the craziest things I've seen in a war movie. Was that possible with WWII era grenades?,5b10qo
dbzweiq,"I I thought Hacksaw Ridge was very good. Mel Gibson directed the shit out of it. I found myself, pondering whether it became gratuitous but ultimately I thought only a few moments could be labelled as such. Some moments did feel very, kind of, Hollywood but for the most part I thought it was tough and unrelenting as it ought to be. That feeling is sort of negated by the brief interviews at the end. The music is overwrought at times. Hugo Weaving is the stand out performance, and Vince Vaughn sort of stands out; he's good but also aides to that over-Hollywood feeling. The sound design is fantastic. The japs are just a faceless evil which felt a bit too typical and easy, and lazy. ",5b10qo

Or it's just a film catered to Americans.

The only positive part about the movie is that it has some great battle scenes. (except no reload, the big actors shots were miles better than everyone else etc)

But the rest? Terrible.
-The beginning shows the two brothers have good relationship, the next is them beating up each other, almost killing eachother. Next thing we know is the brother enlisted and never mentioned again.
-The extremely creepy romance at start.

Throughout the whole movie I simply cannot relate to his reasoning at all. 
He did disobey direct orders, I don't get on what ground did he reject this in the war court.
There were mainly three things he said he won't do: work on saturday, touch a weapon, kill.
Towards the end, he did all three.
He did not only help to kill, but also killed directly by handslap and kick a hand grenade back.
He also touched a gun to save someone.
He worked on Saturday and even delayed the operation by 15 mins.

at the end he broke all three rules and makes you wonder if the writer wants to imply he is learning how to adjust his behavior while suiting his belief, OR it is just poor writing.",5b10qo
ddjslkx,"Overhyped IMO.

Also did anyone else feel like a few scenes were unintentionally comical? When Doss was lowering the first casualty by rope, for example. You see the guy slowly enter the frame in the background while two soldiers continue to be oblivious. Also in the tunnels when Doss leaves the frame but re-appears and ducks behind a corner to avoid some Japanese soldiers. THEN there were the scenes that were just funny because they were straight up stupid. You know what I'm talking about. Grenade volleyball, literal human meat shield.",5b10qo

And that comes from an atheist, I almost thought it was gonna be another God is Not Dead movie or something but it wasn't nearly as preachy.

dcxl4dc,"I was really let down by this one. The acting by Garfield is mediocre. The accents are awful (coming from a true Southerner). It had a few good moments, mainly Vince Vaughn being awesome as usual, but overall it felt like a glorified made for tv movie. Great story but told by the wrong people. ",5b10qo
dd9wy6s,"Anybody else feel like this film did a disservice to a truly remarkable person/story. 
My biggest disappointment was the lack of investment in the rest of the characters in Doss' squad. They felt gimmicky almost. Very little development put into any of them and I think that's one of the reasons the film lacked any real emotion.

dcxfnd4,Just saw the movie. who dome pieces their kid brother with a brick?,5b10qo
d9lbdk4,"The amazing power of the true story in ""HACKSAW RIDGE"" can be found in its hero: Seventh Day Adventist Desmond Doss. He was a pacifist who never killed anyone or even carried a weapon. During the deadliest battle of the Pacific War, Okinawa, the call came to retreat, but Doss, an Army medic, disobeyed the order & risked his life to brave enemy fire in order to single-handedly save his fallen comrades from the front lines. ""Please Lord, help me get one more"" he prays each time he goes back for another solider. Doss displays such an astonishing level of selflessness he transcends war itself with a superhuman ability to love. It's so astounding one can't help but be reduced to tears by his actions & so unbelievable you will want to fact check it after you've seen it to make sure the events portrayed were real. They were.

*There is something so bewildering about this film because its events, despite being true, are so literally unbelievable that paradoxically in order to make it more believable the filmmakers actually had to cut a lot out. (It's kind of like the way Apple had to create an algorithm to make their music player randomizer appear less random because its original state didn't seem random enough to users.) This includes but is not limited to Desmond's multiple wounds & many other heroic deeds not shown in the movie. In reality he performed many of his deeds while being wounded and even in his state allowed others to get treatment before him. His injuries were so severe that it took a toll on his body for the rest of his life. You can read Desmond's entire remarkable account by reading his Medal of Honor dossier.

",5b10qo
d9m3p01,"This film easily jumps up into probably my top three of the year so far. I hope it gets some Oscar nominations, including Garfield's for lead actor. The action was straight up epic and gruesome, yet not to the point of abusing gore. Action and drama were balanced perfectly. My only complaints was that we didn't get more background to the fellow members of the unit and that it wraps up rather fast without giving us much info post battle. I know we get the real documented interviews, but I was hoping for the actors to play out some scenes or some closure. Don't want to spoil anything. 

Also, the amount of Australian actors made sense due to Gibson, but also surprised we didn't have Jai Courtney show up haha. Worthington, Bracey, and Vaughn all did pretty well, especially Vaughn.

d9oe4uh,"I'd give it a 8.5 or 9.0 out of 10.

The budget really hurt this movie, preventing it from Saving Private Ryan's level of greatness.

Hugo Weaving needs to win an award for Best Supporting Actor. His role as Doss's father was amazing. I was truly scared for Desmond when he was around him, growing up. If you had told me that was Elrond from LOTR, I would have thought you were insane.

The two major battles lived up to the hype. Absolutely brutal, and certainly some of the best battles on screen depicting WW2.

Where I felt the movie failed was that the CGI was really off-putting. The SFX really fell flat in the movie... When the battleships bombarded Hacksaw, it looked really fake. When the soldiers got tore apart from the Japanese machine gun fire... It did not look that great in some cases. It may be nitpicky, but it really suffered in that way. The ending of him on the stretcher did not look that good, either. I think that Gibson should have (really) put in the true ending of that campaign with Desmond rolling off of his cot to offer it to another soldier would have been better from an effects standpoint, if not for story progression.

Overall, one of the best WW2 movies ever, but not quite SPR's level of greatness. Better than recent fare like Stalingrad or Fury, though. 

Oh, and I loved the fact they gave Vince Vaughn a freakin' M3 Grease Gun. Loved the fact at the end he was spraying rounds at the Japanese and the bullets were hitting everywhere but the enemy. ",5b10qo
da3vzdm,"...Is it wrong that I found this movie kinda funny? When Doss was crawling over the battleground scavenging for more lives to save I had to contain my laughter. Not a bad scene by any means, but I couldn't help myself!

Some thoughts:

* Three jumpscares in a war movie. C'mon!

* First jumpscare spoiled because the actor was moving before he got up and screamed.

* When Doss pulls the corpse over him after he buries the living soldier, his breathing was painfully obvious, even as the Japenese guy was right next to him.

* If Hugo Weaving doesn't get Best Supporting Actor it will be a national *tragedy*.

* The romance scenes in the beginning between Doss and Dorothy are legitimately horrible. Came off as creepy instead of romantic, which is strange considering the chemistry the two have later in the movie.

* Personal favorite detail is the sound of rats coming out to feed on corpses after battle. Very nice touch!

* Some acting fell flat, most egregiously when the corporal is told about all the survivors sent back to camp by Doss.

* Battle scenes manage to stand toe-to-toe with Saving Private Ryan, a feat very few movies can achieve.

* Brother subplot was a joke. Completely forgotten, as was the actual ending for the movie.

d9n3a8k,"There must be some type of Mel Gibson circle jerk I wasn't invited to- this movie was cheese fest 2016. 

Things were happening WAY to perfectly in way too many scenes. This was a war movie, following the rule of perfect timing in so many scenes just adds to the cheese all factor. 

My favourite cheat scene would have to be the introduction of all the most cliche tropes as THEY INTRODUCE THEMSELVES. breaking the show don't tell rule about 12 times in one scene- I honestly do not mind someone introducing another character, but when it happens that bloody much and in such a short time span: fuck off.

Andrew Garfields acting was subpar, at best tbh. His timing during his lines and over use of him staring at his girl gave off more of a series mirderer vibe than a cute boy who was adorably infatuated with a beautiful girl. 

I hear so many people talking about how the religious aspects of the movies were subtle and not ""in your face""- holy shit, one of the first scenes is him, as a child, standing in front of a poster for about 5 minutes, as we get a chance to look at all the commandments. 

Almost every other scene had some heavy handed God talk- at one point, as Grenades were PERFECTLY blowing up all around him, he started speaking with God- literally! 
Which is fine, but wow, did it ever smell of cheese once again as he ""receives te message"" and ""Bad asses"" or back into the perfectly choreographed explosives. 

Mel Gibson is not back- we just want some type of weird ""he's not perfect, but he's still a genius"" come back story. ",5b10qo

d9lqyvs,"Hacksaw Ridge was an incredibly beautiful personal film that I feel was only detracted because of the obviousness of the filmmaking. Now I don’t know about you, but when I’m watching a film, I try to get sucked away into something, while with this film, with its incessant Christian Iconography and relatively cheap practical effects constantly reminded me that “Yes, this is a movie.” and also “Yes, this is a Mel Gibson film.” These are minor points though, because Mel Gibson is nearly a master of his craft, creating incredibly personal film with violence that truly feels mournful. Later scenes in the movie are reminiscent of the iconic opening of Saving Private Ryan, and the sound design truly emphasizes the weight of violence, be it from a knife entering a man’s chest or a brick smashed across a young child’s face.
The actors in this film are all in top form, with Andrew Garfield delivering a sincere, heart felt performance that never once feels as hokey as it could have. Hugo Weaving also shows far more emotional range than I’ve seen from him in years and Vince Vaughn delivers a delightfully subdued performance as Garfield’s drill sergeant. Overall, Hacksaw Ridge was an wonderful film, but perhaps not as iconic or memorable as Gibson’s previous endeavors.

Or, better yet, why not hang out at the top with some machine gun nests set up to pick off the next group as they climb up?  And why don't the Japanese have some machine guns set up at the edge to kill the Americans when they are staging?  The Army is milling around down there with no worry about the enemy up in the high ground.  That terrain is practically impregnable if they defend it AT THE CLIFF.

I recognize American death was probably happening off-screen since it was incredibly honest filmmaking overall, but the movie suddenly betrayed its perspective (glowy/pretty scenes early, making way for the horrors of war in which his faith and resilience really shined) and then made Doss out to be a deity in the lowering scene.

Sometimes it seems like they have no idea anymore what the founder of the website found appealing about movies and only give high ratings to movies that tackle progressive social issues and knock anything that might be more universally affecting.  

They called this movie a broken mess and said it had no idea how to handle its contradiction with depicting violence and advocating against it.  That simply isn't true.  It's only by being as gruesome as it is (like the battle was in real life) that we can take the full emotion and grasp why Desmond would want to have such an aversion to violence.  But that's not even the point.  His calmness in the face of violence is one of the pivotal aspects of his Christ-like depiction that Gibson so often wants to portray.  Framing his character like this against violence that we can see is not a mismanaged contradiction, it's core to the religious themes of the movie.  If you didn't like this movie, you just don't like Gibson.  But it's not a bad movie on any level.",5b10qo

Pacing was a major issue.  Use of varying degrees of slow motion seemed like something a 1st year film student would do.

Many action scenes ended or were highlighted by 'overzealous', gratuitous shots, like Doss' hitting the grenade out of the air or the slow-mo shower scene near the end.  

Much of the last third of the film reminded me a lot of the editing, cinematography and direction from Passion of the Christ.

I enjoyed the movie, and it's in my Top 20 (probably a top 10 for direction), but you've got three nearly flawlessly directed films, where you can really feel the care and effort that falls into that category exclusively (Chazelle for La La Land, Jenkins for Moonlight, and Villeneuve for Arrival). Then you've got Ford, Davis, Scorsese, and Lonergan who are very awards-worthy. I myself would go more out of the box and favor Lanthimos, Saulnier, and Daniels for their achievements. The Witch was technically last year, I believe, or I'd put Eggers right at the top as well (though Oscars rarely recognize that sort of film - it's expertly directed). 

After all of the above, that's where I'd group Gibson, Coens, and some others.

There was a weird dynamic in the movie where it portrayed pretty (from what I can tell, though I am not a combat veteran) realistic battle scenes with really dumb unrealistic shots, like slapping a grenade, dragging Vince Vaughn transformers style while he is shooting and slowmo running with a corpse in one hand and firing a BAR with the other. I think something that differentiates the battles in this versus SPR and BoB/Pacific is that in those scenes there is a lot of focus on how everyone is working together, with no one person sticking out as a complete hard ass. The graphics in hacksaw were good, but I felt it lacked any real substance in the battles beyond showing ""look how violent war is"". ",5b10qo

I thought the first half of the movie was quite bland, and the overall tone of the film seemed rather confused, from the rather cheery, pleasant looking home life, straight to the somewhat comical brutality of the battle scenes. Overall I found it quite jarring.

The characters were overall very two dimensional and uninteresting, save for Vince Vaughan, and the abundant sentimentality for what should have been a gritty, sobering anti-war film left me kind of disappointed. I feel like it should have been much better than it was, and I'm kind of surprised by the reception it's received. ",5b10qo

Also, hate to be that guy, but I was in the military, and one of the most important things that was hammered into our heads, was that you stay down and make yourself small no matter what you're doing. Giving cover fire, helping someone, talking on the radio, throwing grenades, or absolutely anything? Make yourself small, only your eyes, helmet and barrel should stick our from cover. Therefore, it really breaks a movie for me when soldiers are leaning on their elbows on top of cover, or standing up to give cover fire. Even the bravest soldiers are scared of bullets, and not stupid enough to reduce the chance of being shot tenfolds. So when all the, now clearly actors in my head, did that in this movie, it just didn't work for me. 

Soo much spraying and praying, running and gunning, full auto, kicking grenades, firing a BAR with one hand, action movie-cliches. Topped by an overly basic and cheesy soldier story.

They were portrayed heroically for what essentially was war mongering. Making it seem like they were some pacifist, anti-establishment Japanese soldiers is pure Hollywood bullshit. The Japanese were all in for the war & destroying their enemies, but they did it with pride & conviction.

Simple Grenades really just fling metal shrapnel everywhere. If you managed to stop the direction or it or direct the force in other directions, you can atleast really minimize the shrapnel flying towards your vital parts. 

It also depends on where you are. Inside a contained building, a grenade force has nowhere to go and can be extremely damaging. My cousin was in special forces and throwing a modern grenade inside a 2 story square stone house would contain the explosion that it could hurt anyone in all 8 rooms, 4 on the second floor and 4 on the ground floor when it went in the second story window. Throwing it outside could mean a lot less damage or ricochet from all the shrapnel. ",5b10qo

(From Luke's gospel) One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee, he was being carefully watched. There in front of him was a man suffering from abnormal swelling of his body. Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?” But they remained silent.

It's overwhelming for the soldiers, and it's overwhelming for the viewers. The violence isn't the focus of the film though.

The actual event took place at night; Desmond was in a foxhole with 3 other men when he saw the grenade being tossed. He aimed where he thought it would land and kicked it with his left leg, while simultaneously diving for cover. It went off shortly after he kicked it, shredding his legs and back with shrapnel. He dressed his own wounds and lay there on the battlefield until the litter bearers could reach him. Instead of them taking him straight to the escarpment as the film depicted, the real Desmond Doss spotted a soldier that was more severly wounded and rolled of his litter to help him. After patching the guy up, he had the litter bearer's evacuate the other man instead of himself. Soon after, he got his arm shattered by a sniper's bullet. He made a splint out of a rifle stock and crawled to the safety of an aid station. 

That sounds crazy right? I knew about Desmond's story before the film and I was very curious as to how they were going to handle that scene. Mel didn't think anyone would believe it so he chose not to show all those extra heroics in the film. Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.",5b10qo

They were on the lower side, but I was on the other side lookin' when they threw the thing. I knew there was no way I could get at it. So I just quickly took my left foot and threw it back to where I thought the grenade might be, and throw my head and helmet to the ground. And not more than half a second later, I felt like I was sailin' through the air. I was seein' stars I wasn't supposed to be seein', and I knew my legs and body were blown up.""

On using aircraft, I'm not entirely sure. I will say aircraft were used typically when they should have been used. Around 750 were lost in this battle alone. And quite frankly, you just can't build new ones in the middle of a battle. 

But It wasn't just about the ridge. It was the entire Battle of Okinawa. Invading Japan is VERY difficult. An island chain just isn't the best place to invade because you end up invading multiple land masses. While the Japanese suffered many more casualties, the battle was probably a major reason for using the atomic bomb. ",5b10qo

He gets shot and his whole body violently twists and reacts to the bullet. I shoot a lot as a hobby and that's something I always think about. I see how much dirt a round kicks up after it hits a burm or what it does to something like a watermelon or pumpkin and I think about how brutal actually taking a round (or lots of rounds from a high-caliber emplaced weapon) would actually be.

1. The cinematography and editing is so great there I understand why they wanted to do it. It was a change of pace and style from the relentless earlier action. 
2. For the movie to be historically accurate they needed to cover the second assault but to keep the movie reasonably long and paced they couldn't cover it in the same grisly moment-to-moment detail they did earlier. 
3. I don't think that one scene takes away from the ""war is hell"" message of the movie. At the end of the day the protagonists are American and they needed the final victory to give the movie a proper finale.",5b10qo

The only rule that he didn't break is he won't eat meat.

Would you kindly tell me why after he was told everyone respects his firm belief in faith, he went on joining the war on Saturday which outright contradicts his firm belief?

Or how he disobeyed direct orders but plead not guilty in war court?

Him choosing to work as a medic would mean that he knew he is going in to save life. This is why he has been told the operation will still be going on and the japs won't stop just because of his belief.

Also I see people like you are having serious issue understanding the fundermental issue here.
It's not the WHY that I am having issue understanding, it is whether he DID what he said he won't or not.

Did he reject direct orders? YES
Did he touch a gun? YES (after he repeatedly said he wouldn't bear arm)
Did he work on Saturday? YES
Did he lead to death directly? Well ok since it is an off scene shot, maybe the japaneses suddenly flew away too, who knows right?
(no where did I think he mentioned he would favour Americans than the Japs, especially after his speech about fixing the world and him saving some japs. Not sure why you would think the saving Americans lives would mean ok to kill the japs)

So do I know why he broke the rules? Hell yes, as if the movie doesn't state it any more clear.

Seriously, the movie even try to state it as clearly as possible at the final scene when the army told him he does not need to work on Saturday because he earned their respect. Then he goes on working on Saturday.
It's as clear of a statement:
Did he say he will not work on Saturday? Yes and even go on protest about it.
Did he go on work on Saturday? Yes, even when allowed not needing to work.

Do people have zero issue watching around 2/3 of the movie learning what his faith and his own moral rule are, then only to be all undone in the 1/3 movie?
If the movie try to at least explicit him showing any sign of remorse or conflict when doing those acts, MAYBE it would make him more realistic as a person because he has to break his rules in order to save lives and acknowledge it.",5b10qo
ddmzb04,"You obviously have missed out all the other same comments.

Yes, of cause brother fights, not to that extreme as you have said. The movie showed it was THAT extreme which I had problem with. so your refute on this is basically agreeing with me.

He was the one who took 'touch a weapon' literally. Shooting a target is not an intent to kill, it is an intent to pass the test. The intent is given by him, not to him. (thus the wave the weapon around to pass the test comment)
If he were to take his principle of no killing, then he would have stopped his Sargent killing off dozens of japaneses several times, with his own aid.
He might as well set up land mines and call it not taking life himself. 

Of cause if you are OK with the logic like Batman who thinks not saving and leaving someone to death is not killing, that's OK for you. I am not.

If I remember correctly, he actually did what a pacifists did, he hugged the grenade instead of causing death by kicking it back.

It looks like you aren't understanding my point about the sat duty. He knew he was going to save lives as a medic, despite that, he stated clearly he won't work on sat. So what happened? 

Also you are agreeing with me again on the point that he disobeyed the order. He said he didn't disobey a direct order. He did. whether he is justified and whether the order is rightful under law are another whole level of issue. ",5b10qo

dafvjpq,"The movie has me torn.  There were some shots that were absolutely beautiful - one shot that panned across the active battlefield reminded me heavily of a renaissance painting.  

But, some other scenes took me out of it.  I got taken out of the moment when [he got lowered down at the very end.  The shot looked awkward and cheesy, on top of feeling a bit hackneyed.  And the scene where he managed some grenade-karate felt a bit out of place, as well.](#spoiler)  Regardless of those things, I still want to give the movie praise.  Another scene [where the American used a fellow soldier's corpse as a makeshift shield](#spoiler) verged on being over the top, but added to the gruesome flavor of the film and [the way he carelessly tossed the body aside afterwards](#spoiler) honestly reminded me of scenes from Hitchcock's footage of Nazi concentration camps.  

The movie was moving and surprisingly uplifting.  But, [the use of mortar rounds by banging them on a hard surface and throwing them like footballs, without knowing of how common that might have been in the war, felt like a rip from Saving Private Ryan.](#spoiler) And in addition, [the scene where the man's helmet is shot off and immediately followed by a second round to the head is also reminiscent of a scene in the aforementioned film, although I would say Gibson's take was a slight improvement.](#spoiler). 

In the end, I did like the movie.  While there were some scenes I would have liked to have had cut, I still believe it's worth a watch, especially if it becomes a return for Gibson.  ",5b10qo

The President of the United States of America, in the name of Congress, takes pleasure in presenting the Medal of Honor to Private First Class Desmond Thomas Doss, United States Army, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action above and beyond the call of duty from April 29 – 21 May 1945, while serving with the Medical Detachment, 307th Infantry Regiment, 77th Infantry Division, in action at Urasoe Mura, Okinawa, Ryukyu Islands. Private First Class Doss was a company aid man when the 1st Battalion assaulted a jagged escarpment 400 feet high. As our troops gained the summit, a heavy concentration of artillery, mortar and machine gun fire crashed into them, inflicting approximately 75 casualties and driving the others back. Pfc. Doss refused to seek cover and remained in the fire-swept area with the many stricken, carrying all 75 casualties one-by-one to the edge of the escarpment and there lowering them on a rope-supported litter down the face of a cliff to friendly hands. On May 2, he exposed himself to heavy rifle and mortar fire in rescuing a wounded man 200 yards forward of the lines on the same escarpment; and 2 days later he treated 4 men who had been cut down while assaulting a strongly defended cave, advancing through a shower of grenades to within eight yards of enemy forces in a cave's mouth, where he dressed his comrades' wounds before making 4 separate trips under fire to evacuate them to safety. On May 5, he unhesitatingly braved enemy shelling and small arms fire to assist an artillery officer. He applied bandages, moved his patient to a spot that offered protection from small arms fire and, while artillery and mortar shells fell close by, painstakingly administered plasma. Later that day, when an American was severely wounded by fire from a cave, Pfc. Doss crawled to him where he had fallen 25 feet from the enemy position, rendered aid, and carried him 100 yards to safety while continually exposed to enemy fire. On May 21, in a night attack on high ground near Shuri, he remained in exposed territory while the rest of his company took cover, fearlessly risking the chance that he would be mistaken for an infiltrating Japanese and giving aid to the injured until he was himself seriously wounded in the legs by the explosion of a grenade. Rather than call another aid man from cover, he cared for his own injuries and waited 5 hours before litter bearers reached him and started carrying him to cover. The trio was caught in an enemy tank attack and Pfc. Doss, seeing a more critically wounded man nearby, crawled off the litter; and directed the bearers to give their first attention to the other man. Awaiting the litter bearers' return, he was again struck, by a sniper bullet while being carried off the field by a comrade, this time suffering a compound fracture of one arm. With magnificent fortitude he bound a rifle stock to his shattered arm as a splint and then crawled 300 yards over rough terrain to the aid station. Through his outstanding bravery and unflinching determination in the face of desperately dangerous conditions, Pfc. Doss saved the lives of many soldiers. His name became a symbol throughout the 77th Infantry Division for outstanding gallantry far above and beyond the call of duty.

The army actually estimated the number of men he saved to be around 100, but Desmond didn't think it could have been that many so they settled at the number 75. He also served in Guam and Leyte (prior to the battle of Okinawa) where he received 2 bronze stars for his bravery. ",5b10qo

Before he even gets to the battlfield the entire boot camp and imprisonment sequences are all about Doss's personal struggle.  On the battlefield, there are points where he sets up a plasma IV and it immediately gets hit by a stray bullet, and points where he has to quietly bait a sniper by throwing up his helmet.

Along with tons of other pagan traditions (lots of Christmas and Easter echo pagan tradition).  So basically, resting on Saturday and keeping a lot of Old Testament law is a signifier that you worship the true God, unadulturated by the pagan theology brought in by the early church.  They also place a huge emphasis on the second coming of Christ (the Adventist part of SDA).  You want to live as pure a life as possible in order to ready when Christ arrives, which could be any second now.  That purity involves not eating meat, not doing violence, not so much as thinking about sex in any way, not listening to rock music, not wearing makeup, not wearing jewelry, not working on the Sabbath, not watching non-Christian movies, no alcohol, no caffeine, no smoking, etc. I haven't been a member of the church for ten years now, but I'd be happy to answer any other questions.",5b10qo

 I like movies about historical events and I know that some liberties will be taken when making these things.  You don't like Hacksaw because it's overdramatized, but like the Pacific even though it's overdramatized.  At least be consistent.

I like the Pacific less than hacksaw for several reasons.
The Pacific covers 2 storylines unlike one in band of brothers, which makes it less cohesive.  Not having interesting characters doesn't help much either.  Compared to band of brothers, the production seemed lacking.  Finally, the worst thing was the sex scenes they had every other episode.  Instead of respecting the veterans they included sex scenes to increase viewership knowing who their target demographic was.  This is the epitome of overdramatizing something.",5b10qo

When he took the gun and pointed at his dad he got the feeling that he could do it, just that easy, he pull the trigger and it's done: he kills his dad and taints his values. I thought the same thing: ""why he didn't just take the training and be over with it?"" But you just gotta understand and empathize with someone of strong conviction, values AND his past, ALL he's been through with his family. There's a lot of anger there but he's trying to tame it and taking a gun could show him as a hypocrite due to what a gun represents (I mean, the guy didn't even eat meat) and probably unleash his anger. ",5b10qo
db4dzfq,"Christian Pacifism has several strains. The most common in our present world climate, would be Christian advocates of just war who aren't necessarily true pacifists, but oppose modern war on the grounds that hypothetically, war might be fought in a moral way but our present practice of carpet bombing and guerilla counterinsurgency within civilian centers is certainly not worth supporting. (I fit this category).


Hard-line pacifism, like Dos in Hacksaw, exists in several fringe Christian communities. Most notably the Amish/Mennonites, but Dos was a seventh day adventist.


Within hard Pacifism, it is generally acceptable to ""restrain"". As in hold a violent person down without striking them. Or to act in such a way where your intention is to heal and not harm (ie, surgery). As to the grenade, obviously this was a hollywood dramatization, and the real Dos would have been utterly horrified by all the killing around him. The film didn't draw much attention to it, but he tried to save plenty of japanese soldiers as well as Americans.


I think in reality, Dos would have no problem say, picking up a grenade to throw it out of the way, or kick one aside, or take action to protect his life and the lives of others... but a Christian pacifist would not intentionally kick a grenade back towards another combatant. He might have done so by reflex, or because he failed to throw one into the clear though.


But generally speaking, Hard Christian pacifism sees all human killing (and not necessarily restraint) as abominable in the eyes of God. And their approach to ethics doesn't factor in conclusions, like a utilitarian would. The results don't matter if the process corrupts you and causes you to reject God, in their view. So they rely on prayer, and in times where the only possible solution seems to be violence, they pray for the impossible.",5b10qo
db36sh2,"Sounds like your not religious,  I'm not going to speak for Seventh Day Adventists because I am not one, but I will say that tradition for your strain/branch of church and your personal relationship with your creator are not the same, hence prayer and ones own personal conversation with God. 

Joining the war did not contradict his beliefs - using a weapon to kill violated his personal belief. 

concerning the direct order and pleading not guilty - i suggest you review the law and or specific case or read the book for more details. do remember this was a military court there are documents that can clarify any issues you may have.

grenades are on a timer, you can youtube some grenade training videos that demonstrate this.

I'm not here to teach you how to think. I do recommend you work on opening your mind if you truly are confused, go research it until your happy with what you've learned.  
",5b10qo
dbps7ij,"It was based on the true story. It was the last day of the battle on the ridge. They really did waited for Doss to pray before they go, and that was the day they captured the ridge. Pretty much the movie just followed true events here. ",5b10qo
db57ngr,"Well he wouldn't do basic training on a saturday or perform other duties. Medics do a lot of other stuff, and the vast majority of his service time was not in combat.",5b10qo
dbtlt0q,"Saying that he needs his belt back and telling her his pants don't hold up well without it is true.  Belts hold up pants oddly enough.  He saw Dorothy, thought she was pretty and walked up to her.  He forgot to get his belt back before he did that, which being starstruck is understandable. 

Desmond Doss was using the Conscientious Objection which is in the US Constitution.  This overrules what a military Sargent or Captain commands.

Desmond said that he will not bear arms.  To bear arms means: own and use guns, as a means of defense.  Touching it doesn't mean bearing it at least by what the US Constitution says.

As in the previous comment I wrote, the company of soldiers wouldn't go up the escarpment without him.  Yes, he was allowed to not work on Saturday.  He decided to work on Saturday because his comrades needed him.  Seven Day Adventists allow someone to work on Saturday if they hold a particular position, as I said in the previous post.  Saving lives is better than not saving lives.  A bigger issue would be him not working on Saturday and people dying because he wasn't there to help.  Paralleling this, within the Bible Jesus worked on the Sabbath.  He healed people and the Pharisees condemned him for this.   ""Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, ""Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?""  But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him on his way."" Luke 14:3-4

About the grenade kicking incident.  The real life Desmond did this.  It tells of him kicking a grenade out of the way which saved lives.  He injured himself in the process I might add.  The story never says that he killed Japanese soldiers when he did that.  As the story says nothing of Japanese soldiers dying, the movie not showing Desmond killing anyone is accurate.

"". . . one of the most troublesome texts, relative to anti-Semitic potential, that any of us had seen in twenty-five years. It must be emphasized that the main storyline presented Jesus as having been relentlessly pursued by an evil cabal of Jews, headed by the high priest Caiaphas, who finally blackmailed a weak-kneed Pilate into putting Jesus to death. This is precisely the storyline that fueled centuries of anti-Semitism within Christian societies. This is also a storyline rejected by the Roman Catholic Church at Vatican II in its document Nostra aetate, and by nearly all mainline Protestant churches in parallel documents. ... Unless this basic storyline has been altered by Mr. Gibson, a fringe Catholic who is building his own church in the Los Angeles area and who apparently accepts neither the teachings of Vatican II nor modern biblical scholarship, The Passion of the Christ retains a real potential for undermining the repudiation of classical Christian anti-Semitism by the churches in the last forty years.""",5b10qo

The battle scenes were actually overly gory. When they moved in to attack they advanced almost shoulder to shoulder. No way that would ever happen. 

Once they were fired upon, so many of the men would get behind cover, but then just sit there and have a conversation with their head exposed util they got their brains shot out.

In reality, or in a better battle scene like say ""Saving Private Ryan"" you will see soldiers get behind any cover they can find, get as low as they can, and even start digging to get lower.

Lots of great screenplay and atmosphere that promotes realism, but it's the little corny scenes and some of the scenes that you wouldn't suddenly expect that ruined it for me. I just couldn't take the movie seriously throughout.

Vince Vaughn's role of drill sergeant didn't help either, I thought it was pretty cringe worthy. The movie already went downhill for me after the first part though, but expectation was high from all the good reviews and it really left me disappointed in the end.",5b10qo
db4eq1h,"You are pretty much agreeing with me then. I have mentioned the movie portrayed him as a person devoted to religion in the first half only to destroy it all in the battle and final scene. 

He had no issue throwing back the grenade directed to the Japanese when he could have throw it elsewhere or self sacrifice even considering he disapprove of violence. 

Everyone has been telling him he wouldn't need to use a gun on battleground but he can just wave it around. Towards the end he used a gun as a method to help sergeant to kill their way out. 

It's almost as if he is fine with killing so long not by his own hand. He certainly didn't question bus actions when he helped killing off the sniper or pulling the Japanese away to save a person who in turn blow the Jap brains out. 

And finally he worked on Saturday when he said he wouldnt. 
If anything this shows he has flickering rules on what and what not to do rather than a devoted believer that follows rules absolutely. 

This is exactly why I have said I have nothing against his faith and not even about that. It's the movie that's terrible in the portray. ",5b10qo
db3dxnl,"I don't think you understood my point. I have zero issue with all his decisions about not using a weapon, not working on Saturday etc. 

But I have issue with him contradicting himself later on when we see him casting deaths directly or indirectly. 

This has nothing to do with religion or open mindness, this has everything to do with him standing firm in the first half with his belief only to be all crumbled by his own actions later on, repeatedly may I add. 

And the question is as simple as did he disobey a direct order. Which he clearly did but plead not guilty. Like I said this has no grounds. We saw a lot of times he disobeyed the order to carry a weapon. Whether he is allowed to do so and if it is punishable is another issue. 

I think you need to work on the understanding the points I am saying rather than seeing me as not being open minded, or not religious or not knowing it's a real story. 

Because you are missing the arguments here, for example I have no issue about the way he snap back the grenade and I am well aware it has a timer, I have issue with him not willing to use a weapon but has no trouble throwing back a grenade that arguably is even more devastating. 

I have no issue with him not going to work on Saturday, but I have issue with him going to war on Saturday after being told the army now respects and admire his religious belief about exactly that. ",5b10qo

I find the first conversation between two strangers, one clearly being startled by the female and immediately talk about his loose pants as creepy. I guess to some, it is maybe romantic.

He was asked if he directly disobey the order, he DID. 
Him having a lawful right to deny the order is his defending argument. 
This is exactly the same poor logic you have about him breaking the rules and implying the reason somehow makes his action any different.
They are different matters. 

Like I said before, he said he won't work on Saturday, he worked on Saturday. 
It is as simple as that. The reason does not matter.
You can quote billions of verses and phrases from Bible/excuses/reasons and nothing can change that. 
Not to mention unless he had zero idea that he was going into saving life, he could have already stated at the beginning because of this special role he will play, he will be allowed to work on Saturday. 

Sure, nothing is said about the Japanese soldiers. This is as weak of an argument as it can be. I hope even you can see that",5b10qo
ddngxdr,"My main issue isn't with the person himself but how the movie protray him. 

He laid down a few rules and a majority of the movie tried to protray him as a man who would stand for the right and his moral even under bullying.

His rules were:
1. No touching a weapon
2. No working on Saturday
3. No killing
(and 4. He is a vegan)
How many of those did he break towards the end?
All but the 4th (and 3rd if you consider him assist in killing, is not killing)

I especially have a big issue towards the end when the army finally learn to respect his moral code and told him they wouldn't mind waiting for him because they respect him not working on Saturday. Then he just went on breaking his rule of no working on Saturday.

As far as I remember, he would not even touch the gun when he was told to carry it to show he knows how to shoot one(or show how to hold one? Can't remember clearly anymore). He would not shoot to pass a test when everyone told him he does not need to do it on the actual battlefield. 

I am very certain that he has said he wouldn't work on Saturday not as in his circumstances during training, but as a medic. This is why the others dissed him as how he would go on saving lives when having japs shooting at him, because he also thought it had the 'no killing' clause when he signed up.

db76x31,"They'll say it is because it's ""preachy"" but it only reveals their own insecurity.

To a traditionalist filmmaker like Mel Gibson, the progressive ideology is ostensibly utopian but in character it is deeply nihilistic because it accepts the atomization of all things. The detachment from tradition, the cession of values, the acceptance of ""relativism"", the alienation of men from women, and the increasing moral cowardice masked as righteousness. There is no sense of exceptionalism, there are no moral or physical absolutes. God is dead and the subsequent power vacuum is driving society mad.

Mel Gibson subsequently made a movie which slays their every since sacred cow.

What Dos does on Hacksaw Ridge is in all senses of the word a miracle, and the true story serves as a reminder that moral absolutes exist. Gibson deliberately contrasted his spiritual story of a man's endurance against the backdrop of war against an enemy which took no value in the sanctity human life; one which explicitly targeted healers for death in violation of our Westphalian Christian sensibilities. Many critics criticize how the film's pacifist message is blended with truly horrific violence but the point is lost on them entirely; Only by seeing the true horror of war and murder can we truly begin to appreciate what Dos sacrifices and endures in the movie; we are watching a spiritual journey comparable to the suffering of Christ. Even as the world around him is being torn apart he is practicing his beliefs and maintaining his personal integrity, and those values inadvertently are the salvation of everyone.

Mel Gibson's movie is a rejection of the relativism of the modern world. He has made a movie in celebration of the human spirit and its ability to push back against the forces that would demand he submit to it's oppressing dictation. To have obeyed those orders would have made Dos less human because he not only would be violating his religious beliefs but his personal character as well. He would have compromised his integrity which is his most important value because that is precisely what allows him to endure. I would personally say that agnostic ""progressives"" tend to mischaracterize and miss the significance of this intensity of religious connection and human character (which is also why religion tends to only be depicted superficially, or as zealotry, in most contemporary films).

Hacksaw Ridge is not cinema for the Cosmopolitan creatures living in artificial bubbles divorced from the world. It is an assurance to the common man, to those who feel persecuted as well as those who are skeptical, that they can endure. ",5b10qo

I do agree that a few parts of the film seem to portray him as approving of the violence. The helmet throwing does stand out. But largely, I think the film did a good job of showing Dos as someone who would rather that nobody took up arms. That line:

""It's just a rifle, it won't bite""
""Sure it will, look around you""

I think the story is a man trying to piece a small part of the world back together, when it all seems intent on tearing itself apart. That's one of his quotes. He didn't really care about winning the war. The film's focus on the violence around him could be seen to take away from that, but it also juxstaposes it and makes him stand out in a way.",5b10qo
db9ehuf,"Just because he did what he did does not mean he ""destroyed his beliefs"". For starters people contradict themselves all the time. It's a very humanizing thing, and it doesn't inherently devalue all past actions one might have done.

Doss's conviction to not bare arms was a self-imposed restriction based on the event with his dad, and it was clearly meant as using something to harm another being. When he refused to pick up the gun and wave it around that was because the intent would obviously be to prove he could use it as a tool to cause harm. When he did hold and use the rifle it was as a tool for assistance no different from a stick. Just like the difference between using a knife to cut vegetables and using the same knife to kill and butcher a rabbit intent is key.

Doss had also stated he would not take life under any circumstance. He never said he would stop others from taking life  while in his presence. While you could argue he played just as much a part in another's death as the person who pulled the trigger the fact remains that he didn't pull the trigger, and therefor didn't go against his conviction to not directly kill someone. Yes, that is arbitrary, but, again, that's just human nature.

When the grenades were thrown at his allies by the surrendering troops he didn't catch the grenade and decide to throw it back at the Japanese. He reacted by swatting one in the air and kicking the one on the ground with no clear target. The first one was pure reflex, and the second one exploded in the air before reaching anyone. 

Personally I don't see how any of those situations show him entirely destroying his values. Instead they all come across as believable actions that might bend a moral code, but never outright break it. ",5b10qo

dbts0qg,"Dude I'm really not sure why you are arguing this.  I gave very good reasons.  I think we are confusing commandments and guidelines.  Commandments should never be broken whereas guidelines are advisable unless circumstances change.

Reasons are essential to justify actions.  Actions without reasons are pointless.  We can't just look at an action and base our conclusion off that.  A person's beliefs are never set in stone unless they are true and right and can't be argued against.  Then they must hold fast to their beliefs in the face of persecution.  For example, a person says that they can't do something and change their mind.  If they change their mind for the right reason that is good.  We can't condemn a person for doing that.  If we say that they are bad for changing their mind for the right reason that is the wrong way of thinking.

His MoH was not only awarded for that, but also for the grenade incident three weeks later, which did mangle his leg.

He treated himself and was reached 5 hours later by a group with a stretcher. On the way out they were hit by a tank, and he crawled off the stretcher and told the guys to take the other wounded man first. Someone else came back for him and tried to drag him out, but they were attacked by a sniper and Doss was shot in the arm.

ddfy2ep,"In unisono with you I'd humbly like to add:

To me the movie was so powerful because it showed what hit means to _believe_. And I don't just mean in a religious sense. 

Believe in _something_ is (and here I quote the Bible) dead without action.

I feel that this movie was so powerful because Dos wasn't ""just Christian"". He had believes and morals and stood by them.
In today's day and age, dominated by philosophies that try to question everything and anything, one can struggle to find ones personal truth. And not just that, even if you find something you are constantly confronted with people that don't feel the same way or believe the same as you. 

This movie was powerful for me because it showed how a person can and _should_ stick to ones believes (again this doesn't apply only to religion). 

It's such a stark contrast to what so many people tell themselves (and are told):""anything goes, everything is allowed.""

I believe that this wasn't just a movie about a Christian that would not take up arms but a story to show that one has to stand up for ones believes in the face of opposition. That society ""in majority"" may fault you for your believes but that, if you stick to them, you may prove them wrong. 

This is however an ever present challenge because one _has_ to question oneself or no progress can be made. Questioning ones believes isn't about throwing them over board but reaffirming them. 

That's maybe why this movie got opposition at all, because people thought they were sure what to believe and now, as this movie questioned their believes, they are afraid that they _may_ be wrong. Instead of seeing this as a chance to reaffirm their believes they are scared. Scared that they may be wrong, scared that they have no answer at all, too afraid to see how they could improve. 

Maybe that's what today's society lacks. The will to question ones believes and being able to (potentially) admit that one is wrong. It's not about finding the truth but making sure _my_ opinion is _seen_ as the truth, wether that is actually true or not. I feel like this can be seen in everyday's life. Ranging from eating preferences through entertainment to politics. No one argues goal (truth) oriented but to _be right_.

I don't doubt that many of the visuals were based on history, but the sense of scale was *fucked* so they could fit more people in the shot. The band of brothers sequel about the pacific did a fine job with a lot of the same material, this just took me out of the moment. As a simple example, in the link you posted note how many times the number of enemy machine guns is estimated (""about 8 machine guns"") but in the film they were in full view from the American's PoV. It was a highly stylized and unrealistic portrayal of battle.",5b10qo
dailzse,"It excels at portraying what it feels like, maybe, but the combat scenes were incredibly compressed in scale and unrealistic in the extreme. *The Pacific* did the same types of battles which much more realism in my opinion.

Again, I'm not saying the battle scenes are bad. There are much worse movies out there and at least it looked extremely authentic from a special effects perspective. What they were not, in my opinion, was on the same level as the scenes in Saving Private Ryan.

db9xf5a,"I absolutely cannot see from your pov at all. He did destroy his beliefs if his beliefs were meant to be upholding, of cause unless he regretted those acts later on because he did betrayed some of his beliefs and therefore devalued his moral code.

His reason not to bear arm is understandable. Except that he knows the intention is all that matters or else he would not even use a knife. Practising to use a gun is not an intention to kill, it's a path to pass the test, meaning the intention would be to pass the test. 
Everyone has been saying just wave it around, telling him that he does not need to use it to kill during battle, the intention to get over the test and stop causing trouble. He somewhat neither finally gets it at the end or he just gave up and change his ground.

Your argument for him not taking life under any circumstance I also just cannot understand. If it is something this vague, he might as well set up mines and traps since he wouldn't pull the trigger and it would be the enemy that actively caused their death. Because that is almost exactly what he did when he pulled the enemy up for his team to blow the brains out.

And I do get that the grenades are reflex based, but it does not discredit him taking life directly. 

imo he pretty much outright broke his moral code when the movie specifically told us he won't work on saturday, the soldiers told him they respect his faith and won't push him to work on saturday, and then go on to work on saturday, which then directly caused the japaneses to die and him seemingly does not even show any sign of reaction at all. 

That plus when he claim he is not guilty for disobeying direct order, which he did. 

Anyway I guess I just have a different POV than most people here. 
The whole movie spent 2/3 on how he is firm in his moral codes and belief, won't touch a gun, won't back down from pressure etc. Only then to get close to doing everything he said he won't do. Imagine if he waved the gun and shoot, understanding that his moral code is ""don't bear arms if intent is to kill"", then ""won't work on saturday except in this special time because he is going to save lives"" and also feel remorse/guilty when he caused death directly/indirectly.",5b10qo
dbtxcb8,"Because you keep missing the point.

The question is:
Did he promised to not do X and spent a vast majority trying to ensure he does not need to do X? Yes.
Did he do X later on in the movie? Yes. 

You are giving out answers for why he did X. It only justify his actions but it does not mean he didn't do X. 
And you keep accusing me as not understanding why he did what he did and if it is justified and starts phrasing bible etcetc.

I have already been repeatedly told you it isn't about why, it's about whether he has stated not to do X, stood by it in 2/3 of the movie, only then eventually doing X.
And that is not just X, it is X, Y and Z. 
The only one he didn't break is that he is still a vegan.

I didn't make any conclusion of what type of person he is, these are facts from the movie. ",5b10qo
ddofv6p,"Now that you can see he has broken his rules that was established, I will just repeat once again about a crucial point.

While I will admit I don't agree with his moral ground (since the argument how would he save life's if the Japanese are shooting at him is absolutely legit and we saw how he had to help killing in order to save), the biggest problem I have is not him but how the movie portray him.

The movie spent hours on establishing what he wouldn't do and only to spent last a third of the movie to show him destroying them. He was said to be a person who over think before his actions yet we got nothing to show the regret or remorse from any of his actions.

It just made him an incredibly shallow person.",5b10qo

The Army had no direct incentive to make a conscientious objector look any better in an official report than his actions made him out to be in reality.

dbw9dkl,"I think you are missing the point more than I am.  One of them is getting the facts wrong from the beginning.  You say that he stands by his moral code and then dismisses everything at the end of the movie.  Well this is untrue.

1.) Doss from the very beginning of the movie says he must not kill and doesn't break that rule from the opening scene to the credits.  This is disregarding your adamant assumption that he must have killed when there isn't any evidence of it.  
-Strike 1.

2.) He doesn't use or fire a weapon during the whole movie.  He doesn't disobey orders since he was told when he enlisted that he wouldn't be required to use a gun.  He is cleared of insubordination from his court martial trial, proving he was in the right.  The officer was the one breaking the rules by not following the U.S constitution.
-Strike 2.

3.)  He asked his Captain to not work on Saturdays, due to his religion.  This was a request not a requirement.    This was not something that he stood by for 2/3 of the movie.  He made this request in the 2nd act of the movie (in bootcamp), he worked (rescued people as a medic) on Saturday in the last part of the 3rd act.  Given that not working on Saturday is a guideline, not a rule of Seventh Day Adventists, he didn't do anything wrong or break any part of his moral code.  
-Strike 3

dbwahf2,"I am beginning to think you have some serious flaw logic thinking or it's my English not being good enough.

Doss at the start did not just impose he must not kill rule. He imposed several rules that he broke.

1. He caused death indirectly for certainty and caused an offscreen death that you happily ignore because it was not shown. Under your logic, even if he set up death traps and all the deaths are off screened, you are will happily assume he have not killed since there is not evidence of it, right?

2. He imposed his rule that he should not touch arms, not even waving the weapon around. Everyone has been saying it is the intent that matters here. But he continues to stand firm against even touching a weapon.
Until he used a gun as a tool to save, which is exactly what everyone has been saying.

3. Are you still unable to understand that I am not saying he is in the right or wrong here? It's a simple yes or no here.
He disobeyed an order that was proved unlawful, does not change the fact he disobeyed the order. 
He should have used his defense time to argue the order was unlawful but not argue that he disobeyed the order or not.
I have not done a lot of law studies but from my degree I have done enough business law.
I would be glad to hear otherwise his way is correct.

4. I never brought up it is a rule of Seventh Day. You did.
He explicitly told the viewer that he will not work on Saturday, which he did.
I don't really care if you call it rule/request, he said he wouldn't do it, same as seeing him refuse to even touch a gun.

Well according to the above, you are still not understanding the simple logic here, so stick with the basic first before you go onto baseball.",5b10qo

This is you buddy.  It's called Projection.  It's one of 15 defense mechanisms that are in the subject of Psychology.  Another one is Denial.  Not wanting to accept the facts you instead make your view the reality. That's a pretty dangerous way of thinking if you ask me.  Never before have I had someone argue against something that was so clearly presented and I have never seen what you are arguing come up on any discussion involving this movie.   I'm done.

dbwjprd,"Ok, honestly I don't even know why you cannot understand what is wrong with your replies.
You are essentially defending everything with arguments that are not related to point.
I have made everything as simple as possible once again for you.

1. Did he helped to kill? Yes.
2. Did he touch a weapon? Yes.
3. Did he cause off screen death? Yes, unless all off screen death is not a confirmed death for you.
4. Did he go to work on Saturday? Yes.
5. Did the movie spent 2/3rd of the movie showing him not willing to do the above? Yes
6. Did he directly disobey the order? Yes.

Everything you have then replied are irrelevant and not relating to the questions above.

He touched a weapon because X? Not relevant because he touched a weapon.

He didn't kill? If only by being the majority of the cause of death (help to kill sniper) or throwing a grenade back isn't killing.

He worked on Saturday because Y? Not relevant because he worked on Saturday.

He disobeyed the order because Z? Not relevant because he disobeyed the order, even if it was justified (which I have repeatedly said I understood he was and also the movie showed pretty clearly that he was justified to do so).

Did I NOT repeatedly say I understand the why, but I have issue with how the movie spending 2/3 of movie rejecting those actions and then doing all those in the final part?

Life tip: Always at least make sure you are answering the right question, it doesn't matter even if you write a thesis if you are not answering the right question.  

P.s. Using psy101 as argument does not imply you don't exhibit it yourself. The signs are stronger when one fail to present any counter argument and have to resort to full on defense mechanism.",5b10qo

dbwru8o,"I answered every question you put in front of me and gave my counterargument.  You say I didn't answer the right questions?  Where are you pulling that from?  From the very beginning I have done this.  My replies have not only been relevant to the points you made, but my arguments give factual and rational answers to them. If you don't see that I am afraid that I can't help you.  

And my gosh will stop bringing up points that have been disproven by basic reasoning? Like that he must have killed someone and that it must have happened, but that it appeared offscreen.  You can just about say anything appeared offscreen and then if someone disagrees you can say they didn't show it, but it ""obviously"" happened. It's like saying there was a Taco Bar and Coffee Shop on the battlefield that the troops went to it in-between battles.  When someone says that that is ludicrous, a person can say that it obviously was there but it was offscreen.   Bad reasoning and a poor argument. It just shows that you are grasping at straws and trying to find any fault.

Ok, no more responses.  I have more important things to be doing than this.  I thought my first response was going to clear up what nitpicks you had with the film, but you have been fighting me all along the way.  When reasoned discussion didn't solve your problems you started to insult my intelligence. Bad idea.  That is when I began to believe you didn't want the right answers, you just wanted to be right.  I have looked at your responses to other people involving the same argument and you have not been very receptive to their ideas as well.  You say that the other person is wrong and or that they are pretty much are agreeing with you, even if they say they don't.  I hope you learn something from this, but my hopes aren't high.
This is my last response.  If you respond with another personal  attack you will be reported, so how about we leave this here?

de98l8z,"You're right. He doesn't seem able to use his brain 'logically' in this conversation.
Some really crazy shit happens in war, most of it which seems unbelievable especially when portrayed in movies. Guess what, war is unbelievable. It's surreal. Sad to see people downplaying Doss' role in the war. Nobody wins in a war, there aren't any 'heroes' in war as it's just a terrible, terrible mess. But this guy definitely deserves the medal for risking his own life time after time to save other lives over his own. We should look up to those willing to sacrifice everything to help others.
Most of us would probably be like the character of 'Hollywood'. All talk, pretending to know what war is like and basing their false ignorant concept on games and movies. No idea of what really goes down. 

I'm just ranting now but damn it makes me angry to see people like this disrespecting the ones ready to give everything for the lives of others. My grandparents fought in the war; based on their stories I could never disrespect those willing to fight for their friends, families and fellow humans. Even if war is the most sickening, ugly, stupid fucking thing that kills our fellow men, allies and enemies.

I hate war and everything that comes with it, and I don't even know if I'd be capable of enduring half the things soldiers have to do in war.
Hate wars, hate the 'old sending the young' or whatever. 
But don't disrespect those who have endured it all. Dead or alive. 
For they have witnessed the fires of hell and even if they managed to survive, they will feel the flames for the rest of their lives.",5b10qo
