f61u3aq,"Man, that scene where Mr. Park is just talking about the “smell” of Mr. Kim while he’s hiding under the table was so utterly heartbreaking. The slow zoom on Mr. Kim’s face as he felt entirely ashamed in front of his children absolutely ruined me. Absolute masterpiece.",dps3xy

f6hgc67,"Upon watching it the second time, I have noticed a small detail which might have escaped the scrutiny of non-Korean audiences:

When Mr. Kim was left in the basement alone with that half-mad former housemaid's husband, the camera shows a bookshelf which is filled with many volumes of legal topics along with a study material to prepare for a police officer exam.

In S. Korea, passing the bar exam to become a judge/prosecutor/attorney is widely considered as one of the few opportunities open for the poor to escape their wretched status. As such, the competition is quite fierce and some people waste many years of their lives preparing for the exam but never succeed in passing.

And when they eventually give up, they usually find themselves in a hopeless situation where they need to compete with much younger people to get a job while they lack any kind of job training or a qualification. It is a well known tale in S. Korea that some of those people lose their mind in the process and live as a social reject or even a beggar.

So, I believe Bong tried to tell a similar tragic life story of the husband in a very condensed manner, with that brief shot which shows their happy honeymoon photograph, then subsequently a bookshelf full of legal volumes, thus implying that he too had lost his mind in his attempt to escape the poverty in his own ways.",dps3xy
f6yjg1c,"One of my favorite scenes is when “Mr. Kim” is driving Mrs. Park the day after the torrential rain storm and the flood, and the extreme paradox that is portrayed between how the rain the previous night affected his family and how it affected her family. Mr. Kim is sitting there in the driver seat no doubt thinking about how he has lost all of his personal belongings and she is on the phone talking about how the rain last night has led to such a beautiful day the following day. The way something as simple as rainy weather affects people differently on opposite ends of the social ladder is so devastatingly drastic, for one family it means utter loss and for another it means perfect weather for an impromptu get-together.",dps3xy
f77sbe4,"Surprised no one is talking about the daughter of the rich family and how much she is neglected (emotionally). When the dad arrives home he only calls for the son and has a warm relationship with him, while the only time he refers to the daughter is to remark on how moody she looks. Also the ramen scene shows the mother doesn't really care either, the daughter says something like ""I like ramen too, but when little brother didn't want it, you asked dad and then ate it yourself, you didn't even ask me"". No wonder she latched on to her tutors.

Edit: This is also a contrast to the poor family, where the kids are more or less loved equally (and it’s Jessica who is praised more if anything).",dps3xy

f6jxqkc,"There are a couple bits during the movie that perhaps non-korean audience members may not immediately understand due to cultural differences. And I want to share more insight into these cultural bits cause I found them fascinating and hilarious! Apologies if these were already said before in the thread, but here’s my go if you’re interested in reading:

1. Fruit is extremely expensive in South Korea that it’s considered a dessert. The wealthy family has an abundance of fruit in the house, where the housekeeper continuously brings fruit to the children when they are tutoring. A box of cherries is around $18 and one watermelon is $20 in Korea to give you a better understanding. You never see the poor family eating fruit, unless it’s in the wealthy house. 

2. The rich mom keeps saying to her friends on the phone to not bring gifts to the party, that they can just come at eat hors d’oeuvres. In fact, she tells her friends 3 different times not to bring gifts, and when the guests arrive, her friend emerges out the taxi with a bunch of gifts and there is a quick shot of the table full on gifts in the backyard. This is customary for Koreans and actually a bit funny. Many Koreans say not to bring gifts, but it is always expected that the guests bring gifts to an event (especially a birthday party). If you don’t bring a gift, it’s considered disrespectful.

3. In the same scene as above, the rich mom tells her friend that since the friend drives a Mini Cooper, they can park it in the garage when they arrive. We even see this happen, as they are backing up the Mini Cooper in the garage and the mom says not to cover the Benz. This is because a Mini Cooper is considered “less high status” and not a luxury car in Korea, so they want to hide it in the garage so other people don’t see the non-luxury car. If you remember throughout the whole movie that many people keep mentioning the Benz (the driver who says ride the Benz instead of the subway, the poor children who ask if the dad ever drove Benz before as a driver, when Ki-woo and his dad are at the Benz store studying the car, the many scenes inside the Benz, and at the end when the rich father yells at the poor father to give him the keys to the Benz). Basically, the Benz car is the best car you can have in Korea to show your wealth and status, so it’s hilarious that the rich family would want to hide the Mini Cooper before the party.

4. Koreans use the app KakaoTalk, not WeChat. In post production, they thought that the non-Korean audiences would recognize WeChat more instantly so they went with that translation/subtitle instead.",dps3xy
f5zx2zu,"everyone has said plenty about the incredible storytelling and acting mastery in the movie, but what has stuck with me the most are the beautifully shot frames that make the set pieces and characters truly feel alive through the screen. my favorite shots:

- the way that the half basement and its neighborhood are shot so cramped and narrow! i didn’t even realize that i was feeling claustrophobic until we finally got those wide sweeping shots of the spacious Park home and yard, and felt a physical relief 
- the way that the Park living room garden window fit and filled the movie screen perfectly in most of the shots in that room, compared to the shots of the Kim half-underground street window in which the camera angle was distinctly underground and the view of outside was much less clear 
- the slow-motion shot of ki taek and ki woo throwing water at the drunk pissing outside their window
- the flashback scene of the older couple dancing in the sunlight in the Park living room 
- the shot of the “ghost” ascending the kitchen staircase and emerging from the darkness 
- the entire sequence in which the 3 Kims scatter out of the house (like cockroaches) and take an endless journey down the hillside to their street level neighborhood is impeccably composed, with both the rain and the screen becoming increasingly more chaotic as they descend through what seems like a slideshow of living paintings, with rain and power lines and streetlights and tunnels all harmonizing and climaxing in the soul-crushing flood scene as we are all reminded of their reality. as they deal with the flood, we see in comparison peaceful shots of the Parks enjoying the rain from the warmth of their own home, and gruesome, desperate shots of a family that is losing even more than the Kims down in the bunker. that was a striking illustration of the idea that for any social class at any time, there are always people doing better and always people doing worse. this sequence will stay with me a very long time 
- connected to flood sequence but deserving of its own mention: the frame of ki jeong smoking a cigarette on the toilet that won’t stop spewing shit
- the suspense in ki woo’s bunker scuffle, again building claustrophobia in the staircases and corners and tunnels until a moment that he seems momentarily to escape into an open space before our field of vision gets snapped back abruptly
- at the garden party battle, the way that the camera put the viewer right in the middle of the commotion, frantically looking around in every direction at once and barely able to process the chain of events, really added to the believability of ki taek’s snapping point as we felt the adrenaline and mayhem right along with him, jumping to the same conclusions (for me at least, i know this has been a matter of some debate)
- the dream sequence in which ki taek walks across the empty living room into the sunlight 

i’m sure i missed some but those are the shots that have stayed with me the most! gorgeous film.",dps3xy

f5zozaw,"One of my favorite things about this movie is its ability to balance its tone. It manages to go from laugh-out-loud funny to edge-of-your-seat intense in the blink of an eye (or vice versa) without feeling jarring.

f63540c,"When they were getting drunk in the living room I was so nervous about the family coming back. Then the old housekeeper came back and that was probably worst. Then the family comes back and the situation becomes more tense that I could imagine it. That was such a great turn of events.

The whole movie had me at the edge of my seat. What a great films that tackles so many themes in an unconventional manner.",dps3xy

f5zlvxu,"so many outstanding and unforgettable sequences in this film, but the tuberculosis scene made me laugh so damn hard. Song Kang-ho's expression as he pulls the ""bloody"" tissue out of the trash makes me chuckle just thinking about it.",dps3xy
f5zd7al,"What i loved about Parasite the most is the fact that it's as accessible as it is. You could showcase the thematic angle of the gap between the rich and poor in so many different ways, but Bong found a way to make it extremely fun. The whole first hour or so when the Kims one after another plant themselves into the Park's household with their scheming and tricks is so hilarious and funny, i think basically anyone would enjoy that part on its own.  
It's also an interesting thought, because essentially it brings up the concept of persona, the kims pretend to be different people and their success solely depends on the act, not so much on their actual qualification or personality (which imo also gets reflected by us not really seeing much of their work and how well they do + the son always wondering if he would fit in with the rich people, being impressed by them seeming so natural at the party).    
As soon as they actively get rid of the other two workers it also becomes apparent that one of the messages is that the poor fight themselves to be in the best position to get the scraps of the rich, that's even clearer as soon as we find out about the bunker. That messaging is portrayed in such a thriller like finesse that it's simply exciting to watch even if you don't outright find meaning in it instantly. When the Parks come back from the failed camping and push comes to shove to hide evidence of what was going on that evening, i bet most people hold their breath for the Kims even though they are quite flawed people.  
Not that anyone in this film is purely good or bad though, that's another thing i loved about it. Everyone has their fair share of negative and positive traits, it's not as simple as rich = bad or poor = lazy or any of these common tropes.  
  
One more thing, the ending itself. At first i was a little sceptical but after thinking about it a bit i find it fits extremely well. My reading is basically that Bong says no matter what, you have to play within the system that is capitalism, that's why the son's big plan (who directly goes against his father's 'no plan philosophy') to save his father is the most absurd one quite frankly. Getting rich enough to buy the house. Play within the system, money rules it all. (while implying there is no real chance for him :()    
Otherwise nothing really can change things (the father having to hide in the bunker of the house, a new rich family already replacing the Kims). It's quite pessimistic and bleak, but i think that's kinda Bong's style when it comes to his critique of society and capitalism.",dps3xy
f5zrcek,"According to Cho Yeo Jeong who plays Mrs. Park, the scholar rock represents ""a shortcut to success"". Not saying that's the definitive interpretation, but it makes a lot of sense. The main character's friend gives it to him along with the referral to the English tutor job. It later backfires (when the rock is dropped on the lead). Later on, he puts it back in the stream, a sign that he's given up on shortcuts to success. Just thought that was an interesting insight from Cho.

There was also interview with Bong Joon-Ho where he said he chose the Native Americans/cowboys theme to show that the Parks & the Kims moved into a house which already had occupants but they would ""take over"".",dps3xy
f61fx1q,"I love love love love how Bong films the house. I have such a good sense of how it’s designed, where everything is, where each room is - I legitimately feel I could draw it from memory.

f6ibeus,"People are talking and diving deep into the class separation on why Kim stabbed Park, and while that plays a major factor...

f6ee1eh,"Something that I realized on the drive home was that the father's stance on ""planning"" life did not at all agree with the son's **plan** to buy the house. The older and wiser father has the experience to say that class mobility isn't as easy as *deciding* to get rich, but the son has yet to accept this, and will most likely fail in his quest to join the wealthy and purchase the house. His goal is so far from being achievable that any semblance of hope toward that ""happy"" ending is lost. Such an ""important"" movie for people to see right now!",dps3xy

f74nuph,"Personally I loved the driving scene with Mr. Park testing Kim by holding coffee while he drove. It showed the one skill he did have.

Another thing I really like was the displays of Chung Sook's physical strength vs. how weak her voice sounded at the end of the movie. The medals on the wall that were so precious to them, the throwing, leading the attack on Moon Gwang and her husband when they were chilling on the couch, and kicking her down the stairs so effortlessly. But during the winter segment of the movie all we get is to hear is her calling out to her son in a very weak sounding voice, we don't even see her on screen.

Also, a friend mentioned that in the end, Kim killing Park shouldn't have been a surprise at all. He is referred to as a cockroach, something viewed as a parasite. Actual parasites are known to eventually kill their hosts.",dps3xy
f6e7uo7,"I think family starting off living in a basement house and then ending up in the same place at the end (the son and mother returning there and the father living in an actual basement) signifies class mobility, or the lack of it. People who are born into the lower class tend to stay there, middle class stays the middle class, and the upper class elites continue to widen the wealth disparity. This is shown with the Park's being able to hire all these tutors for their children, affording them the opportunity to get into prestigious colleges, while people like Ki-jeong and Ki-woo can't afford to go to universities even though Ki-jeong is a talented graphic artist and Ki-woo scored really well at the English entry exams.",dps3xy

f7kvuzr,"I thought the metaphor of not crossing the line was very prevalent in this movie. It’s mentioned countless times through the movie and obviously symbolizes the line between rich and poor. 

But the scene where Mr Kim is talking to Mr Park about the high end service business. He is discussing how he was this prestigious driver being poached by this company and how he decided to take the job with Mr Park instead. Seemingly crossing that line and as this happens and truck cuts him off and makes him focus on driving again.

It’s almost like a “stay in your lane” metaphor and it even causes Mr Kim to be like “hey focus on the road” don’t keep looking at me back here.

I thought that was pretty neat.",dps3xy
f6gkvdl,"one thing (out of many) i loved about parasite was the scene where the rich parents decided to sleep on the couch while waiting for their son to come inside. since the beginning one of the most obvious things about this family is how out of touch they are (acting like their child is an artistic genius, believing in ghosts, eating the most expensive korean steak with instant noodles, their gullibility), but that one scene *really* brought them back down to earth, showed us how theyre just people who love their children who would rather be uncomfortable on a couch than leaving their son out of sight. the screenplay didnt demonize them; theyre just a normal family. really great way for the audience to empathize with seemingly unrelatable characters, which makes the ending more impactful.",dps3xy
f6a6o7x,"I visited this thread after I watched the film and I've been enjoying much of all those insightful comments from you (e.g. I totally missed the foreshadowing in a comment that said the maid eats food enough for two persons).

And I noticed several people seem to be curious of the reason why the children of Mr. Kim failed to enter a prestigious university, so I'd like to share my thoughts on this matter, as I hope I might be able to give a new perspective as a Korean myself.

In South Korea, the competition among the high school students to get into a good college/university is quite brutal, so much as to make several of them to commit suicide each year after the entrance exam season.

As such, it's often the case that it's not just the student but his or her whole family is involved in the competition and needless to say, more affluent families tend to enjoy a clear advantage over the others which are less well-off.

A glimpse of this phenomenon could be seen from how both of the children of the Kim family are involved as private tutors for the children of the Parks, even though they are still quite young to worry about the colledge entrance exam.

In South Korea, children of a wealthy family often get all kinds of support (e.g. expensive private tutoring, studying abroad to learn English, and so on) from an early age which helps them getting ahead of others from poorer families by allowing a higher chance of getting better education and a better paying job, thus effectively making the gap between the wealthy and the poor a permanent one.

I believe this could be one of the many aspects of 'the line', which metapor being repeatedly used in the film to make its audiences to acknowledge that it's not really individual morals or personalities of either Mr. Kims or Mr. Parks that do matter, but it's such a line that system has drawn between the rich and the poor that constantly forcing each of them in a crash course, and make them lose their humanity in different, respective manners (e.g. becoming a criminal vs becoming insensitive/ignorant of the sufferings of the lower class).

That was how I interpreted that particular aspect of this film.",dps3xy

fe4omaq,"One thing that I haven’t heard much about in the discussion of this movie: the role of Min in all of this.

We know that Min kicks off the plot by offering the role of tutor to Kevin - partly because he knows the family is in dire financial straits and could desperately use any kind of employment (hence why he also also gives them the scholar’s rock), and because he knows Kevin is actually qualified. However, it seems that his *real* motivation for referring Kevin is because he wants to ask out Da-hye in the future, and (mistakenly) trusts Kevin to not make a move on his girl. As Min says, other university students would fall over themselves for a cute girl like her. He trusts Kevin to not do the same.

To me, it seems as though this says more than Min trusting a friend to uphold some kind of bro code. **Instead, Min trusts that Kevin wouldn’t dare to go for a girl so obviously out of his league.** Min specifically describes other rich university students as potential rivals - but not Kevin. Because Kevin isn’t cool enough, handsome enough, *rich* enough to even register as a threat. He expects Kevin to stay in his lane - to not cross the line - to not even dream of being with a girl so clearly out of his social stratum. And it’s true that Kevin, on some level, feels like he doesn’t belong. But Min trusted that Kevin would never even aspire to more.

Aside from the whole creeping on an underage girl thing (which, I mean, gross), I don’t think Min had the worst intentions. But it certainly demonstrates a bit of the soft bigotry of low expectations.",dps3xy
fel0qhu,"Just saw the movie for the second time with my girlfriend and she pointed out an awesome detail (which I feel like no one noticed yet?): When Mrs. Park shows Ki-Woo the drawing which Da-song made, Ki-Woo thinks it's depicting a chimpanzee, but of course actually it's Moon-gwang's husband. Later when we see the husband in the basement for the first time he strangely devours a **banana** and the camera focusses on him eating for quite some time. Right before the climax of the film, when the raging husband is hunting Ki-Woo up the stairs, his running/climbing looks just like how a chimpanzee would move.

f6h9tmi,"I’m seeing a lot of back and forth about why Kim stabs Mr. Park at the end. My interpretation is that he just decided he wouldn’t stand for Park’s disdain for him and his family any longer.

The Parks are never really shown to do anything that is objectively evil or anything. Their condition is just juxtaposed throughout the film against the Kims’, who have nothing. They live in comfort, oblivious to the plight of the poor. They’re so blind to the poor that they don’t even notice they essentially have squatters in their house. Meanwhile, the Kims live underground, and all their efforts are essentially in pursuit of...work.

The work doesn’t get them out of their condition. They’re essentially risking everything to live in servitude. When the Parks come back early from camping, it never occurs to the Kims or Geun-se and his wife to band together and take the Kims’ house or something— they start scrambling to get back to work and keep the Parks’ favor.

When Kims daughter is stabbed and Parks son passes out (and presumably has a seizure?), Park asks for the keys. Kim doesn’t even think twice; he gives him the keys because Park is his boss. Meanwhile, his family is in danger and his children are bleeding out. When Park covers his nose from the smell of Geun-se, he remembers just how Park and his family feel about the Kims. They consider the Kims beneath them, almost like stinkbugs. This is what drives Kim to take out Mr. Park. It’s not because Park really did anything wrong, it’s just that nothing will ever give Kim and his family what they need. No matter how hard they try, they will always be “beneath” the Parks, and so he stabs him in a fit of rage and hides last second in the bunker.",dps3xy

f6w1rdk,"This movie has stuck to me like glue, and I find myself thinking of the characters.

There were many subtle and not so subtle symbolisms about it, but I think the best part was how smell was used.

It's not that the poor are parasites feeding off of the rich, it's that the poor don't even register to rich people. They aren't even roaches, because they are never acknowledged. They are ghosts, unseen. At most, you can communicate with morse code. At worst, they take all of your time and tell you to shut up because they pay you.

The only thing that could ever break this barrier, that could reach and affect the rich was the smell, and that is why it bothered them so much.

On a surface level, yes the class separation is there for us to see. But on a deeper level, it showed why it was that way.

I also liked how that tied to 'money makes you polite'. Money doesn't make you polite, it makes you not give a fuck. What the poor family took as politeness did not exist, as seen by their attitudes towards other poor people or the pets.

The sex scene and how it built was also extremely well done. The rich father was clearly bothered that his car might have been used as a sex location, but in reality, he was bothered that he had not done that before. He was bothered that he did not have sex with the hypothetical woman. I think that was the reversal of the parasitic role, the rich cannot stand that the poor might do or have something that the rich had not done, so they had to do it.

I really enjoyed this movie. It was very good and deep, with many small details tied together. I think that is what really hit me, how immaculately crafted it was and how it conveyed its message.",dps3xy
f5zq8re,"I've posted my spoiler free thoughts in a few other threads, but I thought this was awesome.  If you're reading through the discussion thread before seeing the movie I'd urge you not to read beyond this paragraph, because there will be spoilers.  Spoiler free, one sentence review: this film is amazing and lives up to all the hype. I've seen it each of the past two weekends, and I think I'll probably make another stop before it leaves theaters.

What I liked: It's incredibly successful at shifting genres.  For the first hour it's a very funny comedy, then it takes a turn to a great thriller. And when it takes a violent turn, the violence is incredibly well done. The thud of the rock hitting Ki-Woo in the skull is stomach-churning. I'd have loved either of those movies, but giving me both of them in one package was incredible. The movie is also incredibly paced. It's about 2:15 but it flew by, I was legitimately surprised when the movie ended because I thought there was no way it was over already. The movie is beautifully shot. Two that stand out in my head would be when Geun-sae is coming up the stairs and you can only really see his eyes in the darkness, and the shot of Ki-jeong sitting on top of the toilet as it's basically exploding. Personally my favorite types of movies are those that have something to say or a deeper meaning, but they also work if you only care about the surface level narrative. This movie is would still be great if you don't care about the moral ambiguity, or what it has to say about class, or the comments it's making about South Korean culture. But it does have that deeper layer that will keep me coming back to it again and again.

What I didn't like: These are all going to be pretty nitpicky. There are a few plot points that never really go anywhere.  For example when Ki-Woo first goes to interview, Mrs. Park is sleeping in the yard and it is never brought up again. Also the coincidence of the family slipping and falling in the bunker is maybe a touch too convenient.  By like I said, these things really don't hurt my enjoyment of the film at all.

Overall this is an easy 5/5 for me. I'm not sure if it's my favorite of the year, but it's an easy top 3 selection so far (of about 75).

fdsdldk,"The scene where the guy is peaking from the staircase is pretty scary for a movie that's not a horror flick. What makes it interesting is that there were many things throughout the film that made this particular scene so terrifying.

A. The fact that there's a buggy eyed man peaking from your staircase alone.

B. We found out the picture the son kept drawing was the face of the ""ghost"" he saw that night. The corner of the drawing that ""Jessica"" mentions was actually the basement where the man came from.

C. The most terrifying thing about this scene for me was that Mrs. Park thought her son saw a ghost, when she and her family were completely unaware that what her son actually saw was in fact a real person who was living under their house for four whole years.

Mrs. Park assuming that the guy her son saw was a ""ghost"" is very in tune with one of the ongoing themes of the movie that the Parks are completely oblivious to their surroundings in their own home. For instance, they didn't realize that the people who were working for them was actually a family playing tricks on them, and they had no idea that their maid was hiding her husband for four years in a basement that they were also unaware of. The Parks could've figured it all out had they just looked down. They would've saw the visible mess that the Kims made under the couches. They would've caught the Kims hiding under the table and realized that they were actually a family all along. They would've found out that the maid was hiding her husband had they looked deeper inside their home, but the fact that the Parks never looked down to see what's right under their nose will forever stick with the audience. The creators of the film did an excellent job with storytelling. The foreshadowing and imagery in this film was very carefully placed.",dps3xy

f5zgnd1,"*TL;DR: I wax poetic about how much I love this movie, but Parasite is damn good.*

I saw this film a few months ago, and all I can say is I’ve been constantly thinking about it since. Films can often be overhyped as we ramp up to awards season and perhaps some users in this subreddit will feel that *Parasite* is one of those films, especially now that American audiences are getting to see it in theaters and more and more people are talking about it. I was lucky enough to see it before most of this discussion, and though I knew people were saying great things about it, I went in fairly blind. Personally, I think I still would’ve thought this was a masterpiece even if I’d seen it now, but I understand how expectations can color someone’s experience watching a movie. And in some respects, *Parasite* does require you to suspend your disbelief.

All that said, *Parasite* is — by far — the best film I’ve seen this year, and I believe one of the best films of the decade. Bong Joon-ho is at his best here — teetering on the edge of comedy while injecting every scene with a sense of overwhelming tragedy and melancholy. We laugh while watching but the “it’s so metaphorical!” truth of it all is that there are lines we cannot cross, attitudes we cannot change, and systems from which we cannot escape. It’s hopeful and hopeless at the same time.

There’s a [review](https://letterboxd.com/faithlessphil/film/parasite-2019/) I read on Letterboxd that perfectly encapsulates why I believe *Parasite* is so masterfully crafted as a narrative and as a film, which I quote here:

>There is a house on a hill, and there are people in it. And they're nice, but not really. There is a garden, and there they get a lot of sunlight. And it is nice, and they get to sleep there sometimes.

>There is a house underground, and there are people in it. And they're the first to tell you that they're not very nice: they're con-men, grifters, forgers and imposters. They sit among stink bugs, and they've been there for so long that maybe they've convinced themselves that they just belong there.

>There is a rock, and it is a gift, but it is also a burden. And maybe it's a metaphor, but it's also just a rock: solid and heavy, difficult to lug around, and dangerous in the wrong hands. Some people will tell you that it's supposed to bring wealth. But again, it's also just a rock.

>There is a line, and it cannot be crossed.

>There is a smell, and it comes from the underground. And the people who live in the house on the hill can smell it. And the people who live underground try to imagine a life in the sun, a future where they aren't just garbage to be washed away in the rain. But there is a smell that sticks to them, and they know that they can never really belong.

>There is a world, and it is nice, but not really. There are houses on hills, and houses underground. There is plenty of sun, but it isn't for everybody. There are people grateful to be slaves, and people unhappy to be served. There are systems that we are born into, and they create these lines that cannot be crossed. And we all dream of something better, but we've been living with these lines for so long that we've convinced ourselves that there really isn't anything to be done.

>There is a knife. And it doesn't do much in the long run, but there will always be some satisfaction in crossing some lines.",dps3xy
f626msw,"This is a masterclass in storytelling. Every detail and dialogue matters. No frame feels wasted. It manages to say something about class divide without ever feeling heavy-handed or preachy. I think my favorite part of the film is how the story is told through music and the camerawork. For example, the whole sequence about the maid and the hot sauce blood is brilliant: the character's expressions in slow motion, the way the camera travels in and out, the orchestral score. But also, it seamlessly transitions between genres so effortlessly and effectively that you don't even notice. I could not find a single thing wrong with this film and for that I think it's a masterpiece.",dps3xy
fefz7cb,"This is the type of smart, thought-provoking, and uncomfortable movie Joker wishes it was.",dps3xy
f6vucmc,"The smell that keeps being mentioned thoughout the movie... I think I know what that smell is. While it definitely is symbolism of the stink of poverty, I also do think there's a true smell.

Have you ever been in a basement that's damp with no air circulation? It smells like fresh mold. Like when you put your clothes through the washer and forget to take it out for a day and you come back and it smells of mold. 

You can even see they hang their clothes up to dry in their home, but if the home never gets sunlight and gets damp as any sub basement does, all their clothes are going to have a slight smell the Park family can't help but notice.

For a family who has never had to deal with this, of course they notice it, but can't describe what it is. Their live is devoid of mold or anything old and rotting. The best description the father can give is the smell of the subway which is the most commonly used mode of transportation in Korea, clearly drawing the line of commoners vs them as a class above the rest.

We are most familiar with things that surround us... Which is why the Kims originally think the smell is from using the same detergent when switching detergent wouldn't matter at all. They just don't understand that they stink of poverty.  

It's not that Mr Park is purposefully revolted by that smell, it's a natural reaction... So when he plugs his nose when reaching for the keys, I can see how a father who hasn't given up on his family and doing anything he can in his power to raise him family out of poverty goes apeshit and takes his momentary vengeance.

What masterpiece.",dps3xy
f7n1vdx,"The pacing and buildup of this film is so good. For the first half it follows a steady trend where it seems like there is actually hope for the family of hustlers to ""make it."" It lured me into suspending awareness that the odds were so incredibly stacked against the Kims, that they were playing a rigged game from the very start. All hope gets erased so suddenly and unceremoniously at the end.  

Ki-woo's aspiration to make enough money to buy the house so his dad can finally climb the stairs (social rungs) out of the basement... that hit me especially hard because of how sadly obvious that's an impossible dream. There's such a stark class/socioeconomic divide in our society that is seemingly unbreakable. Sure it can be broken on a temporary basis--like when the Kims are enjoying themselves in the Park's living room--or by a lucky fraction of poor people, but the overall divide of rich and poor persists.  

Ki-jung, who was the smartest/most resourceful member of the poor family (as Ki-woo said, the only one who looked like she ""belonged"" in a rich house like that) met a sudden demise. On paper, she had the most hope of ""making it out."" After her death, there is no more hope. The family is just doomed to purgatory for the rest of their lives. Ki-taek to his version where he is resigned to his life as a ""cockroach""; Ki-woo to his version where he continues to chase the impossible goal of great wealth. Each sad in its own way.  

It's a poignant commentary on how hard it is for the vast majority of people--for many, impossible, really--to break out of poverty if that's the hand they were dealt at birth. It's jarring to me personally because on the one hand it seems like my family and I _were_ able to do just that. We immigrated to the U.S. when I was a kid and we lived in the slums for years. But things like this film remind me how much worse it is for so many people. For us, making it to the U.S.--even if it's to the slums--was a way more fortunate situation than billions of people ever come upon. My parents worked hard to break free from poverty and rise into the middle class, and I've followed/built on their footsteps. But we weren't nearly as resourceful as the Kim family from the movie (granted, our starting situation wasn't as dire, either). Even as resourceful as the Kims were, and as hard as they hustled, they still got fucked over in the end. It makes me realize that even with all the hard work my parents put in, it took a pretty big dose of luck in our favor to break out from poor to middle class. A few wrong turns (unexpected health problems, taking a bad job, an ill-advised loan, etc.) and we could've been stuck in poverty for way longer, maybe even for the rest of our lives. And that is the fucked up reality for a lot of people.  

I'm sure I'm missing a lot more metaphors and messages; this film has been very thought-provoking and I'm looking forward to rewatching it. _Parasite_ is going to stick with me for a long time.",dps3xy

f5zlw7h,"Watched this back in September and i've been dying to discuss this with others. Some really neat details i've noticed after two watches:

- Mr. Park commenting on the maid's tendency to eat massive portions of food, when she was clearly just taking them down to her husband in the basement

- Mr. Kim mentioned working at a Taiwanese food shop, which might've been the same one the maid's husband operated before debt collectors drove him underground.

- The Kims always leave their windows open

- 3/4s of the pizza boxes were folded correctly, and the other 1/4 were the rejects. Mr. Kim is the reject. Of all the family members, he's the only one who never fully integrates. He spends the entire movie trying to personally relate to the Kims, but the encounter with the maid's husband followed by the flooded apartment makes him feel that he's always gonna be poor, a designated chump, and that no pretension can change that. By the end when his daughter's been fatally stabbed and all his boss can do is demand his help and hold his nose at him, he's had enough. 

- This one's a headcanon, but Jessica's strong disregard for Mrs. Park + Mr. Park's fetish for the dirty panties might've suggested an affair between the two. This might've also been part of Mr. Kim's final straw to stab him at the party.",dps3xy

A few small but noteworthy details which I only caught upon my second viewing:

* The Kim's daughter Ki-jeong was the only one of the four family members who neither killed nor intended to kill anybody, yet she's the only one of the four who gets killed herself.
 
* During the opening scene, there's a ""blink and you miss it"" photo of the Kim's mother Chung-sook discus throwing in a photograph on their wall. Was she in the Olympics? The photo is definitely of SOME competition. Not only does this demonstrate how she used to have a much better life, it also shows that she's not just throwing discus ""to try it out"" on the Park's lawn later in the movie. She's an expert.

* The shot of the housekeeper Moon-gwang looking forlorn as she walks down the street leaving the Park's home, after being fired? It takes on a whole new meaning upon the second viewing, knowing that she's leaving her husband behind. That shot hits so much harder.

* For like half a second, the Kim's daughter Ki-jeong is shown putting hot sauce on her pizza, foreshadowing how she'll come up with the idea to use hot sauce as fake blood.

* The movie takes place in June, they mention it for one line, yet there appears to be a ""Merry Christmas"" decoration still up in the basement.

* The almost imperceptible zoom, probably taking a full minute or more, between Da-hye and Ki-woo in her bedroom during the kiss scene. So effective yet subliminal -- you don't even realize it's happening.",dps3xy

fg8t99a,"A few details I noticed and loved:

- That Mrs Kim was right about Mr Kim the whole time when she said ""when the lights turn on around him he scatters like a cockroach"". The first thing Mr Kim does when he's finally exposed in killing Mr Park is flee and scurry into the darkness of the basement. 

- Mr Park previously says to Mrs Park that he likes Kim because he comes close to ""crossing the line"" in terms of getting too personal but always stops himself. This makes it all the more intense when Kim finally has enough of his resentment and shame and does ""cross the line"" by killing Park. Its also an interesting metaphor that in doing so Kim showed that even for a brief moment he wasnt truely a parasite because he was willing to keep his pride instead of continue to leech unlike Guen-Se who had an almost sycophantic admiration for Mr Park. You could also interpret it as Kim truely becoming a true parasite as some do end up killing their host in the end.

- Mr Park didn't know he had Guen-Se in his basement for 4 years. This reflects how people that contract parasites may not even notice having one at first but they're still unknowingly giving the parasite all it needs to survive.

- The scenes with the drunk guy peeing in the street by the Kims basement home may seem just for laughs but it showed that while  the family had basically nothing they still had their pride and this is what made them dangerous. What was also fascinating about Mr Kim was he seemed like a waster, who thinks honest work is pointless and doesn't seem to care about anything at all so accepts his position in life. But deep down there is pain, resentment, pride and anger. He reacts so badly to his wife's claim that he'll scatter when he's exposed because he knows its true. He claims he's just acting when he reacts violently, but the truth is he's actually acting constantly and that was one of the few moments he was being real. The whole family aren't just acting to leech off of the Parks. They lie and act constantly day to day with others and to themselves.",dps3xy
f6l4ys9,"I thought there were some parallels between the social message in this movie and with Us. That the class that some people are in isn’t a function of their abilities or character necessarily. 

The dynamic of power shifting between the families in the basement showed that. The family on the lowest rung had to be desperate and conniving, but as soon as they had an upper hand on the other basement family they didn’t empathize with them. 

And when the basement couple got the upper hand on the family they in turn showed no empathy.

f5zrcwj,"At the beginning of the film you can see the Kim family folding pizza boxes only for 1/4th of their product to be rejected because they are “unsightly”  and “rejects”. 


The “unsightly” and “reject” was the dad. Out of the group, the dad seemed the most concentrated on making the pizza boxes like the girl in the video. Once the boxes were the delivered and 1/4th were “faulty”, the camera then focuses on the father who sees his family from his basement window. That’s where his resentment towards the top or his inability to assimilate seems to start snowballing. While his family seemingly had no issue being part of the rich family, father always seemed to be pointed out. The smell of being poor makes him feel like an “unsightly” and “reject”. Being talked down on by his boss, having to hide the basement dwellers in the basement and locking himself in. It’s like he was “born there” in the filth. Underground. Meant to always be filth. Can never get out. Perhaps this is how harsh Korean society can be? He snapped when his boss, once again became bothered by the smell. Then when he ran away and started living in the basement. he went back to being the reject.



EDIT: Coming back to this, im sure there is a whole other layer relating to Korean society that most of us can’t grasp. Im not Korean but i have seen Korean generosity and that’s perfectly embodied in the father. He wants the best for his family and is extraordinarily humble. I can only assume That that’s how many Korean head of families are. So seeing this traditional Korean father lose hope and do what he did must’ve been extremely disturbing for Korean audiences.

f5zd5el,"What a wild fuckin' movie this was. It's pretty impressive, because of how I live my life I've seen the trailer for this movie probably 30 times and I had some general ideas of what might happen in the movie but the whole thing still took me by surprise. Leave it to Bong, am I right?

This movie is just wildly good. It's kinda funny, it's suspenseful, surprising, well acted and shot, and just crazy. Kevin says it best in the first tutoring session, it's all about vigor and momentum. Just because you don't know the answer to a question doesn't mean you slow down. When shit starts going off the rails in the movie the family doesn't make every right decision, but they make it confidently and they keep moving. 

Obviously this movie is heavily about class. And it's a pretty interesting take. One thing I loved is that the rich family wasn't evil. I feel like that was what we expected from the trailer, a poor family tries to take advantage of a rich one and the rich family ends up being nuts or something. But really, the rich family is almost totally aloof to the plot of the movie the entire time. They're just living. They're not evil in any way, in fact I wouldn't call anyone in this movie evil. Anyone who's not the rich family is just trying to get by, and the rich family is just tryna live with the opportunities they have. 

When it's revealed who the true ""parasite"" is, this movie just turns up to 11. I guess you could say the first half of the movie is kind of slow, but I didn't find it to be. I found it well acted and shot enough that I wasn't bored and it was neat seeing basically this family of con men replacing an entire household staff one by one. 

And sure, they were con men, and yes, they ruined a life or two in taking those jobs. But they were also just trying to get by, they saw an opportunity and they took it. Even though they drew first blood on the old maid and her husband, it's hard to blame them. I didn't get the idea that they were being greedy at any point in the movie. They staked their claim to be able to live off a family that has too much and when someone threatened that they kept up their vigor and momentum and reacted to it. 

I mean, you have one family that is so heavily in debt they have to hide underground, one family that is just trying to eat and not live in an alley that gets pissed on, and a family that has so much they have no worries, and it all just kind of equals destruction due to the desperation of the two poor families. 

And that idea is really brought home by the end. Where they lead us to believe Kevin really made it and was able to buy the house and he said ""All you'd have to do is walk up the stairs."" and they hug. Then the camera brings us back to reality where Kevin is still living in poverty and we realize that he will probably never be able to afford that house, and therefore save his own father from that life. It's incredibly sad and poignant, and even worse that people had to die just so everyone could end up where they started. 

This is an easy 9/10. Go see it, go tell everyone you know to see it. Bong is crazy for this one.

f723jdo,"I thought this was an absolutely brilliant film and I think it says something that my theater actually clapped when the film was over, which I didn’t think people did anymore. 

I can’t decide how much I like the ending. I thought the film was going to end with Kim Ki-taek walking away with blood on his hands and it was such a beautiful visual that I think it would have been a perfect place for the credits to roll. But the last 20 mins with the Morse code message and the fantasy really cemented the tragedy of the story. At the beginning, the Kim family was struggling but like Kim Ki-taek says about plans, it was easy to never be disappointed because they didn’t have anything to wish for to go right.

 Now, with Kim Ki-woo trying to find enough honest work to make enough however million dollars to buy the house in a deeply stratified society with little economic opportunity, it’s very unlikely it will ever happen and the family will feel even more hopeless as a result. The actor has an interview with Vulture where he reveals that the lyrics to the song in the ending credits basically say that his character would have to work 564 years to make enough to buy the house. 

I think this film particularly spoke to me because my mom is a housekeeper and she has a lot of rich clients that the Park family reminded me of. Not that my family ever did anything similar to this, but just in the sense how the rich are so oblivious to their own wealth, privilege, and power until it’s time to remind you of it in order to put you back in your place.

fehgj2q,"Some things I wanted to just write down since this was (IMO) hands down the best movie I’ve seen in ages;

- Loved the use of stench as a symbol for poverty. The fact that their class permeates who they are, that they are instantly recognize-able as outsiders among the wealthy. I also thought it was really deft that Mr. Park just observes the smell, it’s not really intended to be malicious, just ignorant. 
- Mr. Kim coming full circle regarding the hidden basement/husband trapped within. At first he pities him, sees him as different than himself. Then he slowly accepts that they’re the same, even down to their smell.
- I’m not Korean, but feel like their were some strong allegories to South/North Korean and even US (the Indian themes, US schools, MiUSA products) foreign relations.
- The theme of art and it’s interpretation. The mother thinks her son drew a self portrait when really it’s the poor husband stuck in the basement. It’s impactful that she can’t make the distinction even when so much of the movie is about defining “the line” between rich and poor. 
- The rock and the water as symbols were really powerful. How the rain is entertainment for the rich and ruin for the poor.  It’s so funny, the main character literally gets bludgeoned over the head with the a metaphor but it still somehow didn’t feel all that heavy handed.

They seemed to pay their staff really well and the reasons they let their chauffeur and housekeeper go were pretty valid reasons (even though they didn't realize it was all lies.) Their main crime wasn't malicious exploitation so much as it was being just being completely *oblivious* to the struggles of the lower class. The Parks are sheltered and naive. They were so easily taken in by lies about TB and that silly imaginary story about the girl on drugs who left her panties in the car (they even fantasized about it later.) There's a guy *living in their basement* and to them he's just a ghost their crazy kid saw. Literally the worst thing they did was say that Song Kang-ho smelled like a boiled rag. I don't know... maybe that's still ""exploitation"" to hire servants and to not care about them as people. But I think it's more interesting to think about the division between the classes as being more about a total failure of empathy and understanding than about rich people deliberately victimizing the poor.",dps3xy
f6hpvms,It’s definitely going to win best foreign film. It deserves to win best film. But we know how the Oscars work...,dps3xy
ffsihz9,"I would also add:

* During the movie Park girl mentions how her little brother just fakes being a ""**genius**"". Throughout the movie we were teased that the Park boy is smart and talented enough to figure out the man in the basement. But at the end he's just a little boy, not specially gifted or smart. It shows how the elite like to pretend that they are smarter, better, more educated or morally upright than the average person. But in reality most of them are just lucky to be born in a rich family. Kim family is in fact in my opinion far more talented, cunning and arguably educated. Yet, they are put down by their socioeconomic status

>Basement guy switching lights on each time Mr. Park comes homes is a great metaphor of the working class. Mr.Park is oblivious of the force that makes his comfortable and luxury life happen. While the underprivileged fight amongts each other to keep his paradise afloat",dps3xy
fij08p9,"What a great movie. I went in knowing nothing about it and it delivered. 

When the old housekeeper came to the door when they were having their fun in the living room, I felt a definite shift on tone. Then they went down to the hidden basement and I was truly freaked out. I didn’t know what to expect. And then the birthday scene was wild too. 

Awesome movie. 9/10",dps3xy
fkadmxj,"I've watched this movie only once (so far) when it was released on Blu-ray, and still... I cannot stop thinking about what a masterpiece this movie is!
It was outrageous. It was hilarious. It was genius. Everytime I thought I figured out where the film was going, it took another direction. The metaphors in the film are on another level. The cinematography in the film is beyond beautiful. The characters were so interesting! The intensity, the humor, everything was on point. 
But mostly I wanted to discuss the symbolism. I scrolled through a bunch of the comment section and didn't see anything relating to such so forgive me if this is common knowledge or if it's been said before. I just wanted to talk about it.

The table in the dining room. Such a huge center piece, but only 2, maybe 3 people actually sit at it at any point of the movie. But did anyone count how many chairs are at the table? There's 10 chairs. Symbolizing the rich have so much room at the table, but they don't share it. Stating there could have been space for the Kim family, the Park family and the maid and her husband in the basement.

The light switch that the man in the basement turned on whenever the Park's came home I think had some symbolism in the deed itself. How the lower class is always working for the man upstairs. Demonstrating how the rich see the poor: expendable. Even when it comes down to something as simple as a light switch. Can be forced out by excelling technology like actual sensors. (Maybe I'm stretching with this one, let me know)

Crossing the line. ""He never does cross that line"" Says Mr. Park refering to Mr. Kim. With several moments before Mr. Kim was being aggressive with his wife and shoved everything off the table. (Yes it was in a joking manner, but was it?) Throughout the entire movie, it foreshadowed Mr. Kim slowly breaking and crossing that very line. From driving in traffic (as Mr. Park was referring to) dealing with the man urinating on his street, and to arguing with his family... We see this snap slowly form but it becomes indefinite when he tries to take care of the basement situation, and unintentionally concusses the maid. Things go to shit (literally) with the Kim's home flooding in rain and sewage. And then ya know, several hours later his 2 children are dying. And Mr. Park is demanding the keys while trying to avoid the smell of the man who lived in the basement. All of this rage and misfortune has added up and he crosses a line he can't undo. Point of why I bring this up is that this foreshadowing was so subtle that it made the end result of this movie still wildly unpredictable. And that there's lines all cleverly captured between the rich and the poor and they never cross it because the rich like to keep that separate. Link to an example here: https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/comments/f2hbd2/in_parasite_2019_literal_lines_are_used/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

And finally, the stink bugs. How the film is so cleverly titled Parasite, and the stink bugs represent the Kim family and how they are Parasites leeching off of the Kim family and their resources for survival and prosperity. But most importantly, most mind-blowing of all foreshadowing... Out of all bugs to reference this with at the very beginning of the movie, Bong chose a stink bug. And it is the smell and that reaction of Mr. Park that sets the whole finale ablaze. 

Thanks for coming to my Parasite talk. Maybe I'll get some sleep tonight. Maybe one day I'll stop thinking about the brilliance of this movie. But until then; feel free to share your thoughts and what you agree or disagree with in the symbolism of one of the most amazing pieces of the century. 
Bong Joon-Ho for life!",dps3xy
f5zhdtd,"Honestly, before watching Parasite, I wasn't sure whether I was going to like it or not. In the past, there have been Bong joon-ho movies I liked (The Host, Mother), but also ones I didn't care for (Snowpiercer, Okja). The only reason I went out of my way to see Parasite was because of how glowing the reviews were, so I had no idea what to expect.

But wow... Parasite was absolutely amazing. Not only is it my favorite film of the year, but I would argue that it's one of the best films of the decade. Everything about it is perfect. The acting is perfect. The cinematography is perfect. The writing and directing are perfect. It's the kind of movie that film students should watch in order to understand how to make a great film. I loved the humor throughout Parasite, but also really enjoyed the more dramatic parts just as much. I also thought ht ending was very satisfying. Probably the most satisfying ending I've seen in a film in a long time.

I barely ever see films more than once in theaters, but I'm planning to watch Parasite multiple times before it leaves and goes to Blu-Ray (which I'll definitely be buying). I really hope that this film gets a Best Picture nomination, although I know the chances are low.",dps3xy
f7mwxi3,"I'm curious how people interpret Ki-woo's line that perhaps one day he'd work hard and be able to buy the Parks' house for himself. Is this something he truly believes for himself? If so, I sort of view the ending as the capitalist system having consumed Ki-woo. His chances of ever becoming rich at the beginning of the movie were slim to none to begin with, but at the end he's arguably worse off and has a criminal record to boot. But hey, pull yourself up by the bootstraps and you can become anything you want, right?

I saw a few upvoted comments with how it was the Kims' greed that fucked everything up, and while I agree that that's literally what happened, I feel (especially with this being Bong Joon-Ho) that the main takeaway is that the working class has no solidarity among one another. Had the Kims agreed to help Moon-gwang, they could've finessed that entire situation hard for all of their gain. But Chung-sook is almost revolted at Moon-gwang suggesting they're anything alike. As long as the poor have someone to look down on and all that, keep the masses bickering, etc.

Lastly, what did people think of the Native American costumes worn by Mr. Kim and Mr. Park? I strongly felt this was a nod to capitalism decimating entire cultures then packaging them up neatly for mass consumption, while the end consumers undoubtedly have no idea of the connotations the costumes hold. The Native American headdresses are brought up twice in the movie and it seems too explicit to just be a random detail.",dps3xy
f825yl4,"Just a simple praise for the film from me about the rain! I love how they incorporated the rain into the plot so seamlessly.

* Thunder during Ki-Jeong's moral frustration.
* Adding to Moon-gwang's misery and hopelessness in front of the door cam
* Canceling of the camping trip
* The poor family running home in the rain after sinking back into dire circumstances
* The flooding of their neighborhood

f7q3yix,"Who wouldve thought a movie would out-society Joker in the same damn year?

Woo boy. Just left the theater and so much to unpack. Absolutely nihilistic class war movie stuff to the brim with symbolism, setup, pay off. Blind celebrity worship of the lower class represented by the dude obsessed with Mr. Park, the disconnect of the flood being a happy event for the Park family while destroying the home of the poor family, the literal descent from the high rise rich neighborhood to the slums, the family hiding in fear under the dining room table while the Parks have sex unknowingly, and of course, both sets of servants leeching onto the family in a late stage capitalistic nightmare. 

One thing that struck me while watching this is like, what would a person of the same social class as the Parks think of the movie? Seems so festeringly spiteful towards the entire upper class in a way that even addresses the sociopathic disconnection towards the lower class",dps3xy
f6dvsfb,"What a masterpiece. Was not a great fan of Joon-Ho Bong's movies up to this point (I didn't think Snowpiercer or The Host was that great) but loved this movie. I want to point out some intricacies with the dialogue that may be lost on a non-Korean audience.

There is a clear difference in the way the Kims talk inside/outside the Parks' house. Inside their dialogue is well-enunciated, with English words replacing every other Korean word - outside, their dialogue is crass and filled with profanities. This is a performance from the Kims to mimic the way the rich talk. 

The way Mrs. Park talks would be striking (and very jarring) to a Korean audience. Her speech is filled with English words, even in situations where it doesn't make too much sense (as a side note, Korean doctors tend to do this as their education requires them to have a better understanding of English than others). It is obvious that Mrs. Park is using English to flaunt her status.

When Mrs. Park uses English incorrectly (or speaks it with an obvious accent), Bong is obviously poking fun at the shallowness of the rich. But there's a little more at work here - through the pervasive use of English in the dialect of the affluent, Bong is trying to point out the inferiority complex that Koreans (and East Asians in general) tend to have towards western civilization. 

This inferiority complex manifests itself in a number of different ways throughout the movie.

\- Ki-Woo's friend (the very same friend that gives Ki-Woo the ""cursed stone"") leaves to the U.S. to pursue his studies, even more obviously highlighting the difference in status between Ki-Woo and himself.

\- Ki-Woo starts working at the Parks' as an English tutor under a western name (Kevin)

\- The school Ki-Jeong pretends to be attending (to have graduated from? don't remember this part too well) is Illinois State, not a well-known Korean school (such as Seoul or Yonsei Univ.)

\- When Da-Song is camping in the garden in the midst of rain, Mr. Park tells Mrs. Park not to worry as the Indian tent should be waterproofed well ""since it was manufactured in the U.S."" (implying that a Korean good could not be as trusted)

\- There is nothing Korean about the interior of the Parks' living space. The only thing ""Korean"" I could see in the house were the preserved fruits, which are appropriately hidden away in the basement.

\- A guest performs an Operatic piece at Ki-Woo's birthday party. If you look closely, a white waiter? Chef? can be observed at the event as well.

In this movie, the Poor pretend to be rich, and the Rich tailor their lifestyles to western standards (or what they presume to be western standards through the consumption of Western Media) for validation. 

What does Bong think about this? I think he makes his thoughts clear in he bloodbath at the climax of the movie. Here, Bong is warning the Korean audience against their reverence for western culture - he is telling us that we, the Korean people, have spilt our blood for the American capitalist machine, and pointing out that we (the Koreans) are ""Parasites"" to other world powers in the grander scheme of things (the Native American garb is there for a reason). Is there a more dignified way to be a Parasite? Yes, he says, there is.

There's some other interesting details in the movie as well (especially regarding Japan/Geun-sae's past), but the details regarding western culture were the most striking for me.",dps3xy

In Korea, it goes farther. A lot of lower class dwellings are very small and many times have mold. The smell is truly horrible, and manages to infect your clothes. You can take as many showers as you want, it will still be there. I’m not going to lie, many times I expressed a similar reaction as the Park family father to that smell.

fmgiy47,"I just watched Parasite for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it! One thing did stand out to me though. Based on what I had heard before watching the movie I had expected Parasite to be a more one sided criticism of the wealthy Park family and the class disparities that separate them from the Kims, however when watching it I was struck by what felt like a critical portrayal of both families.

Much of the Kim family's behavior fit in line with what you might hear from an economic conservative about why the poor are poor. They are unemployed, and when they do try to find work they do a bad job assembling the pizza boxes. Throughout the rest of the film they lie and scheme/commit crimes in an attempt to take advantage of, and extract money from, the Parks. Finally, after the fiasco in the basement Kim Ki-Taek (the father) tells his son not to plan for the future - because plans might not work out.

I'm not going to delve into the criticisms of the Parks because I think they have been well covered, I just find it interesting that I hear so many people talking about this film as a criticism of the wealthy when the poor family at its heart reads like an argument against food stamps (lazy, unemployed, criminal, never plans for the future). 

A few of the points I made work the other way too, for example Ki-Taek's argument against planning could be viewed as a point on the pitfalls that keep people trapped in poverty no matter how hard they work and no matter what plans they follow. That being said, I came away from Parasite thinking it was a criticism of the Park family, and the class system they represent, but also a criticism of the Kim family - sort of an everyone is to blame argument. 

This more nuanced approach didn't affect my enjoyment of the movie, I liked it more than Snowpiercer, which I felt was almost to direct with its allegory/message. I mostly found it interesting because most of the critical and popular conversations around the film focus more on the criticisms of capitalism and the wealthy.

f8vofee,"One plot point that really stuck out to me and the people I watched it with: why let the old housekeeper back into the house at all?

At that point in the film, it would have been easy to send her away, ignore her, tell her you’re not at liberty to let anyone in the house while the homeowners aren’t there, etc. The old housekeeper had absolutely zero leverage on the family and they took a massive risk letting her back in the house, which of course leads to all the insanity that ensued. There was just no reason for the wife, acting as the new housekeeper and maintaining her role, to let a dismissed employee back in like that so carelessly when her employers are away. Both in the context of her pretend role as well as the risk to their family being caught, I saw no reason to believe the family thought it was the right idea to let her in.

I thought this was a misstep here that was forced by the plot’s necessity, rather than a result of the character’s organic decision-making imo. Of course everything that we got out of it was still incredible, but I wish there were a better way they could have re-introduced the housekeeper.",dps3xy
fekqgpv,"I didn't see this discussed but I wanted to add - I thought it was interesting that the Ki-taek, hiding in the bunker after killing Mr. Park, apologizes to the images of Mr. Park in a shot that mirrors when Geun-sae is ""worshipping"" him. Who knows how long he'll stay down there, and we can assume Geun-sae was never that unhinged before living in the bunker.

Additionally I'm kind of surprised at all the arguments over whether Mr. Park deserved to be killed/Ki-taek's motive/etc. IMO Mr. Park's murder was never meant to be an act of justice or comeuppance, ie to validate that Mr. Park was a ""bad person"" that got what he deserved or that Ki-taek was a ""bad person"" and committing murder was the inevitable result of all the chaos he helped cause.

Of course Mr. Park didn't know Ki-jeong was his daughter, and of course he would prioritize his son's health over hers. But I also completely understood Ki-taek - he's watching his daughter dying in front of him, he sees his son being carried off with a bloody head injury (and unconscious, so to Ki-taek it could have looked like he had died), Mr. Park doesn't show any concern for Ki-jeong bleeding to death and demands Ki-taek to take them to the hospital and then just for the keys, and to top it off - at the WORST possible moment - he sees that look of disgust on Mr. Park's face because of his smell. He snaps.

Mr. Park has the luxury of being able to tend to his son, and Ki-taek doesn't. A reoccurring theme in the movie is that the Parks don't HAVE to care about anything that doesn't affect them personally (the torrential rain, etc). Taking in all the disparities between them - Mr. Park's wealth and status, his condescension and desire for separation between his employees, and his means (transportation, functional cell-phone, likely proximity to a hospital) vs Ki-taek's overwhelming poverty, his rebuffed attempts to break out of class boundries and penetrate into Mr. Park's circle (""But you love her, though""), and his complete lack of resources (no car to drive his daughter to the hospital, and no cell service to call an ambulance, etc) - at this moment of chaos and tragedy, knowing Ki-jeong was likely going to die while Da-song had ""only"" had a seizure, Ki-taek's anger and bitterness and grief take over.",dps3xy
ffvat91,"Something I noticed that I haven't seen mentioned

In the very beginning when the exterminator is coming around, the dad says let the smoke in to get rid of the bugs and everyone starts coughing, except him.

And when the Kim's are indulging in the living room the dad starts wondering about what happened to the last driver. Then the daughter goes off about how they should be focused on themselves (p.s. the brother mentions she fits in in the nice house).

I think these points illustrate how the dad is the least parasite like. He's compassionate and considerate, even thoughtful and caring. 

Probably has to do with why he was so mad by the end.

After seeing the older housekeeper and her husband play with the cellphone footage like they were North Korea with their hands on the nuclear launch button, I was amazed. Are they representing North Korea? Hidden away in a nuclear bunker, communicating with the West in whatever means they have (morse code), taking scraps to save themselves (foreign aid)? Perhaps the Parks represent western culture or the US (western boyhood fantasies, everything was made in US, money, extravagant arbitrary parties, etc. Maybe the Kims represent South Korea in some way, or at least a side of it.

The Parks repeatedly bring up liking them as long as they don't ""cross the line"" and the reference earlier to the 38th parallel seems to suggest it.

As I mentioned earlier, lots of unexpected paths in this film. Beautiful cinematography, great dialogue and acting, tonnes of symbols and metaphors, the director did a great job of getting all these elements together to make a thriller that has consistent momentum and excitement, and a plot that makes you question everything. Highly recommended to be watched in the theater, don't wait until it comes out on streaming. The theater sets the tone even  better.",dps3xy

fedy6e7,"This movie was so good it's everything critics and fans say it is. If you're thinking about watching it please go for it it's a ride that you won't forget.

But with that said let me also say my piece and say that this movie gave me such a sense hopelessness after the end.

The ending of this movie was so heavy handed it does such a good job of faking you out thinking that Ki-woo is actually gonna be able to somehow get the house back, but that ending shot of him is just him sitting down and clinging to his desperate letter and plans which the father establishes never works out for them. So yeah while they were never exactly the ""good guys"" in the movie but I couldn't help but feel bad for them in general and it's honestly fucking with me how good Bong Joon-Ho was able to convey his message of how far the Gap is in capitalism and bow different the classes are that seeing a fictional character and thinking about how their lives will never change and in a way...worse off now than ever and will just make them sink lower into the life in which they so desperately try to climb out of is more heartbreaking than anything I've seen lately.",dps3xy

fio3r0c,"Key Takeaways (for me personally):

\-The entire concept that the two poor families are battling it out to service a rich family was fabulous. The concept is usually so enigmatic and hard to describe, yet they do it with ease. Why are they fighting? They fight to have a shit job and provide service to a rich family. This norm is consistently held up, rather than fighting the status quote they are fighting to keep it with the illusion of self preservation.

\-The blatant comparison of how the >!flooding impacts one family compared to the other (a house gone vs. a nice, needed rainfall, and how shortly thereafter the chaotic planning of a birthday party is almost the same scale as the flooding emergency was for the poor family is beautiful.!<

\-The fact that the poor are dirty, smelly and violent and the rich are generally nice, they pay well, they watch their kids, love their family. It just displays the polarity of wealth distribution. The rich can come across as high, mighty and above the rest yet their decisions and the lack of the ability for the poor to gain upward mobility locks the poor in this negative feedback loop of the dirty, smelly and violence. Though they come across as semi-respectful, their decisions bear weight on the families (literally) below them.

\->!The concept at the end that all he has to do to solve his problems are climb the ladder of wealth. That all he needs to do is work harder. This is the lie we tell ourselves to alleviate the burden of guilt for the rich. Ahhh it hurt so bad watching it. For a second, I thought it was real and I was disappointed at the ending and as it ended with simply the desire the message was so clear.!<

>!\-The explosion of violence and the murder of Mr. Park being attributed to ""crazy homeless man"" versus the circumstances he was put in. We blame the poor, not the circumstances that society has created that got them there. No reflection of ourselves.!<

\-The image of the girl sitting on the exploding toilet in the flooded room smoking a cig is iconic. And as mentioned by another redditor, I would hands down buy that.",dps3xy

When Ki-woo tutors Da-Hye for the first time and the mother watches. His lesson feels super unconventional, he doesn't focus on the material but rather the importance of 'vigor' when writing her exam. He takes her hand and feels her pulse, and Mrs. Park gasps in shock. To me it just didn't feel like a good lesson and I don't know if it was supposed to come across that way.  


What's with that? Did he really demonstrate that he was at or above Min's level in teaching/English? Does it show that Mrs. Park is just so 'simple' that she believes in methods like this?

fe06x04,"Just saw this film.  One of the best artistically shot films that I've seen in a while.

One thing I noticed early on in the film was the light in the staircase leading to the basement.

Early on, the Park mother is talking to the Kim daughter (art teacher) at the kitchen table.  In the background, the housemaid is coming up from the basement.  The camera still focuses on the conversation with the basement staircase in the background.  During the conversation, the light in the staircase suddenly just turns off.  I didn't think anything of it, I just thought it was automatic lights.

But as the film progressed, I noticed that the lights didn't turn on when someone went down those stairs.  Specifically the scene where the housemaid came back during the night and went to get ""something"" from the basement.  The lights stayed off.  The same thing with the Kim mother (new housemaid).  She went down the stairs too, and the lights still didn't turn on.  

Then when it was revealed that the crazy guy in the bunker controlled the lights from the bunker, it all made sense.  He controlled the lights from where he was, even the ones in the staircase.  And the reason the lights were delayed in turning off from the first scene I mentioned, was probably because he waited a certain amount of time after his wife safely climbed up the stairs (probably after delivering food to him).

Something I noticed, wanted to share here.  Amazing film!",dps3xy
fegj85a,"I thought it was weird when the rich mom stated that she didn't care if the tutoring resulted whether her daughter's grade improved or not and she just wanted Ki-Woo (the replacement tutor) to be 'brilliant' like Min. Also the way the rich mom also got flustered when Ki-Woo held Da-hye's wrist. With how DA-hye was being ignored in favor of Da-song it seems like what she really wanted was a tutor that will 'date' and distract her daughter. Not a tutor that will really help her daughter academically. Also with how mom is in charge of hiring help, it seems mom likes handsome guys with the description of the original driver as ""young and hip"".",dps3xy

A big part that stuck out to me was how after the storm and the events that happened in the house that night, the Parks still expected Mr. Kim to work the next day, and invited “Kevin” and “Jessica” to the party—because why wouldn’t they? They knew nothing about what happened and had a fun party to organize. Watching them try to keep up their act despite the crazy shit this went down was painful.

She seemingly hand-waves any sort of danger or second thought about letting her son cavort about being a nuisance or even for his own safety.

f5zfkxq,"As a Korean, watching this was a blast, especially when picking up on seemingly innocuous details that non-Koreans may not. For example, when Ki-taek examines the fake diploma that Ki-jeong made, the subtitles have him saying, “Does Oxford have a major in document forgery?” In reality, the name of the university is Seoul National University, one of the 3 prestigious universities in South Korea (that, Korea University, and Yonsei University make up the acronym SKY). Another piece of subtitle fun is the characters referring to a phone app as “Whatsapp” when it’s actually Kakaotalk. The scene when Moon-gwang and Geun-se force the whole Kim family to kneel and raise their arms high brought back memories of my parents punishing me the same way whenever I got into trouble.

Someone had already spoiled part of the ending (that Mr. Park dies) for me, so both before and during the film, I was a bit wary of what could happen since I knew that the Kims’ charade was coming to an unfortunate end sooner or later. I was in no way prepared for the midpoint twist involving the secret bunker, and I’m so glad that I wasn’t.

Thinking about that twist really makes me appreciate how perfectly crafted the story is and also Bong Joon-ho’s mastery of tone. It’s at that point that the film shifts from being a comedy to a disquieting tragedy. It works so well because Bong has been planting the seeds: ~~the shot of Moon-gwang going into the cellar/bunker after Ki-jeong tells her to leave her and Yeon-kyo alone following her first session with Da-song,~~ the constant shots of the characters going up and down stairs, the shots that cram the Kim family together into one frame but never the Park family (one of my friends pointed this out after she watched it), the simmering class resentment - all of these culminate in that gut punch of an ending. All the while, Bong still invites you to laugh, like when Mr. Park and Yeon-kyo get intimate on the couch as the Kims are trying to escape, or when we see that shot of Geun-se’s head slowly appearing up the stairs in Da-song’s trauma flashback, but he never allows us to lose focus of what the film is ultimately about.

Bong is on top of his game here. For a long time, I believed *Memories of Murder* was the one film of his that he would have difficulty topping, but I think he’s done it. Bravo!

If anyone came out of the film digging the music as much as I did (the track that plays during sequence where the Kims clean up their messes as the Parks head home is superb), you can listen to the soundtrack [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttKyPsVeBxs&list=OLAK5uy_lnHtGq8SeIN7NYYyYU9gq4H1OG550ZRzo) (EDIT: apparently the soundtrack is blocked in some countries).

I also recommend reading this [essay](https://blog.lareviewofbooks.org/the-korea-blog/parasite-bong-joon-ho-comes-back-attack-homeland-wins-palme-dor/) that highlights the film’s (and Korea’s) interaction with the West.",dps3xy

When describing the table layout she wanted, she says something to the effect of ""*like wings of a bird, you know from that famous battle in \[some war novel(?)\]*""...definitely gave me a ""huh?"" moment...not that rich / entitled people don't read, but it seemed a remarkably specific reference out of character with the entitled stay-at-home wife we'd seen until then. And at the grocery store she seemed to know how to pick out shrimp, despite having always had a full-time housekeeper to do the shopping/cooking. I started to wonder whether the gullible simpleton thing was...all an act(?) Was she pretending to be simpler than she was in the presence of people she perceived to be of lower status.

fbskomq,"This movie was just unbelievable all the way through. It was funny, beautiful, dark, mysterious, deep, cutting and more. There were several scenes where I almost teared up just at the visuals on screen, like when they show the housekeeper and her husband dancing to music years before, or at the end when the son is fantasizing about his father ‘climbing the stairs’ and you see them embrace in the empty house, all to find out it’s not real at all.

The class commentary was strong and I felt like there were tons of small pieces of symbolism thrown it that you could only appreciate fully by seeing multiple times but none of it felt overdone or obvious. Even throwaway lines like when the rich husband is worried about rain seeping through their son’s tent and the wife says, ‘We got it from the US so you know it’s good’, could be interpreted as a sly dig at South Korea’s capitalist system being mirrored based on the US. 

Just a smart, detailed and ambitious movie, I never felt like I knew what was coming next but I did feel a subtle dread throughout which made me uneasy. Wonderful, wonderful film.

I also felt very strongly like it was similar to US and sure enough I saw the director even commented on it. I felt like this movie was a bit more clear in how it addressed the themes but very much a sister film imo",dps3xy

fhd1fb9,"I've been thinking a lot about the ""semi-basement smell"" and, after a second watch, realized something that many viewers might have missed.

To preface, I've lived in Korea for a short time (a few months) in the past.  Unlike in the United States, many S. Korean households will have a washing machine, but not a dryer.  This is because dryers are an added expense and use too much electricity; thus, many Koreans prefer to simply air-dry their clothes.  You can even see in the opening shot that the Kim family's socks are being air-dried by the window.

Stay with me, here - I think that the semi-basement smell is a function of the poorer Kim family not having a dryer + having to air-dry their clothes in a partially underground area that most likely retains more moisture than in above-ground complexes, leading to a higher prevalence of mildew which makes up the ""semi-basement"" smell (which is more easily describable as a smell similar to B.O.).  That's why they can't get rid of it even if they decided to waste money and wash each family members' clothes with a different brand of detergent.

Hopefully that puts this part of the movie into better context for non-Koreans who are used to the luxury of being able to dry their clothes in a dryer.",dps3xy

After the storm, the Kims are barely keeping life together, scraping together spare clothes in a gymnasium. By contrast, the Parks are already moving on, putting together a celebration to forget the storm.

When Mr. Park was talking of his poor-man's smell we could see that he had started developing some dislike for them. When they were returning after shopping there was another brilliant scene where we could see Mrs Park's feet beside Ki-taek's head (mostly hidden by the seat) followed by her opening the window after smelling his odour. She talked of how great weather was due to the rain and the same rain had drowned the slums and made Kim's family homeless.

Finally it ended with him seeing his son unconcious and heavily bleeding, his daughter stabbed and Mr Park shouting on him to take out the car, his switch flipped and by that time no part of him resembled the simple dad-joke making dude we saw in the starting.",dps3xy

fn73cw3,"Great movie tbqh. I may go on an unpopular opinion hear but I actually hated the Kim's. I felt the parks were actually quite nice. I was really sad when mr.park died.

I agree with some of the criticisms that the parks were insensitive at times
-the rain incident
-instantly replacing long time workers
-saying Kim's smell bad 


But 2 things on that. 

1. How could the parks even have known about the Rain incident if they don't live their or watch the news. I hear people saying the parks just simply don't care because they are rich but I disagree. Bad shit happens everywhere in the world and we are expected to know about it all the time? No I think that's ridiculous. 

2.Yes they were condescending in the sense saying that subway people, but I think the Kim's were at fault to with being condescending. Such as when they said ""The parks are so naiive"" ""if I were rich i'd be nicer"" well no that's not how that works. 


But yeah tbqh Kim's were way worse

Guy at the beginning
-betrayed his friends trust and broke his promise. (Even with the dating)
-ran the risk of ruining his friends relationship with the parks
-was completely okay with cucking him for that girl but only for financial gain


The daughter
-was okay with getting a cab driver fired for sexual allegations. (Ruining someone's life for your own gain) 

-was cool with manipulating someone into believing they were an ""art therapist"" then going behind their back saying how stupid they are ""condescending""

They were all cool with Keeping people tied up/nearly killing them just to keep the lie/money coming in

They were also cool with ruining that house keepers life once again for their own gain


I think the mom and the dad were just enablers and placing their blame/faults on others 

End conclusion is that the Kim's were far worse people than the parks.and I'm still sad about mr park dying",dps3xy

fnmnx8w,"Does Kim Ki-Woo really go full on crazy in the end of the movie? This was a point of contention among myself and friends who watched the movie with me. Upon waking from his coma, Kim Ki Woo is uncontrollably giggling. The doctor notes this is a common side effect following brain surgery...but it continues longer than this- into his trial and Kim Ki-Jung's memorial. This to me is an indicator that he is not in a stable mental state. He then becomes obsessed with the house that traumatized him and his family and makes a hobby out of climbing the mountain to spy on it. He sees flickering lights and learns Morse code to decode it and his plan to save his father is to earn millions of dollars to buy the house and free him? This is wildly unrealistic and a stark contrast from the logical, conservative plan he formulates to make money at the beginning: tutor for a rich family and get his family members jobs around the house that are needed.  Why not sneak into the house at some point in the next several years? All of this seems out of character and obsessive making me question whether the light flickering he sees is actually Morse code.

Side note: He mentions police following him for a bit and then stopping (a symptom of paranoia) and the janitor who interrupts the funeral moment creates and eerie sound that seems to mirror the sound effect used by Bong Joon-Ho to intensify the scenes following the shelter (Heard when  Kim Ki-taek is shopping with Mrs.Park). I question why he would draw intensity in the funeral scene if not to amplify the mental unraveling Kim Ki-Woo is experiencing.",dps3xy

There has been some discussion in Korea about how everyone should ""keep their lines"" after the movie was released, especially when there was a political scandal touching on this issue of inequality (Sense of helplessness is quite prevalent in Korean society; it is usually portrayed in other Korean movies as well).

fj9kw2s,"A very subtle moment alluding to Ki-taek’s past was when Min brought the rock.  They opened the box, and Ki-taek knew exactly what it was.  The rest of the family didn’t seem to know about it, and even Min looked surprised that Ki-taek knew.

I thought about this after rewatching the opening scene, and Min’s reaction made it seem like it was more than simple storytelling exposition for the rock.  So maybe it’s another clue that Ki-taek hasn’t always been this poor, and his quietly building anger is at least partly based on resentment about falling from a higher rung on the social ladder.

(my other clues are his ability to drive smoothly, knowing his way around Seoul without a GPS; his attempt to run a business; and items in the apartment that still look like they’re packed up from a previous move)

Start at 6:32 —
Ki-taek: “Ahh.  Is this a landscape type?  Or you can see it as an abstract type.”

The first and final shots of the film were the same. It starts with the Kim family's basement window and pans down to show Ki-woo sitting by himself. At least in this scene, it's daytime and sunlight is beaming through the window.

The final shot is the same. Through the window, you can see it's night time and snowing. The camera then pans down to show that Ki-woo is still sitting alone. He started and ended in the same position. There was no mobility.

The change from a warm, sunny day to dark, snowy night also shows that he's in a worse situation than before. His sister is dead and his father isn't with him.

When his friend gives him the rock he is told it will give the family material wealth. This material wealth is represented by the house. When the Kims go to the house, the things they like the most are the material objects. For the son what’s important is being rich and ‘belonging’ there. Needless to say, despite getting the material objects they wanted, they end up in a worse position. In the end- after parting ways with the stone- the reason the son still wants to get the house and become rich is not for the material objects or to ‘belong’ but rather as a way to bring his family back together. After all that’s happened, the idea of being rich is no longer as important for him as reuniting with his father.",dps3xy

I could never have anticipated how crazy this movie would end up being. I figured it would be a slow burn drama strictly about the two families and the socioeconomic factors between them, but the second half elevates the film into a tense, anxiety-ridden living nightmare as soon as the old housekeeper rings that doorbell, until the very end.

I mean I think it is pretty clear that the Kim family was horrible. Not in an evil way, but that is just how they were. The Parks were empty too.

I get that story-wise, they need the housekeeper to get back in to reveal the basement, but it just doesn't make sense that they would let her back in. Literally nothing bad could come of them leaving her out. If somehow the family found out that the mom/housekeeper didn't let her in, she could chalk it up to the old housekeeper's TB and not wanting her to infect the rest of the house. 

And I'm also not one to try and ""re-write"" films, but it would have made much more sense to have denied her entrance to the house, then have the old housekeeper sneak in somehow. She knew the house better than anyone, so it would make sense in the story that she would know of some secret way to get in that everyone else didn't....

There are a few things I’m confused about though. Why exactly was the houskeeper’s husband living in the basement? Was it to avoid the loan sharks?

And what was the endgame of the housekeeper trying to come upstairs and confront Mrs. Park and Mrs. Kim? Her husband was in the basement, and while she would have ruined Mrs. Kim’s cover, she would have also ruined her own.",dps3xy
fiofapx,"I think there was some symbolism to both the main cataclysmic events of the film occurring because of the slips at the stairs of the bunker. As Mrs. Kim is speaking with the old housekeeper and her husband, she is in full control of the situation and threatening to call the police while the rest of the family is peaking behind with curiosity. As far as the maid and husband are concerned, the new housekeeper is there legitimately and had nothing to do with their own misfortune. When the rest of the family slips down the stairs this allows them the leverage to know the truth of the situation and sparks the giant fight between the two working class people.

Then later, when the son goes downstairs at the birthday party, the situation is neutralized with the couple locked away. The son is going down, either to make amends or kill them (open for debate) but either way, the danger of the previous night having been resolved. However, when he slips and drops the rock, this gives the husband the power to attack him with the rock and eventually wreck chaos onto the birthday party and ultimately results in the disaster that it creates on the lives of all characters.

On the surface level, these are just events that need to happen in order to advance the plot along. However, what I glean from this is how in a capitalist society, the lives of vulnerable people, no matter how ""in control"" things appear to be, is always just one slip away from falling into utter ruin and tragedy. Things can be humming along with what appears to be a precarious stability, and one event, whether it be a job loss or medical emergency, can plunge lower class individuals' lives into a state of chaos that they will not be able to so easily get out of.",dps3xy

The father of the poor family clearly undergoes an awakening. The flood was a reckoning. He cosplayed as a rich person, drinking fancy liquor in a luxurious house, then barely snuck out to find his own home literally covered in shit. 

Afterward, he seems to acknowledge to futility of his situation. There’s no plan. The leader of the family of schemers says there’s no use in planning. He understands that all the plotting in the world will never lead them to their dream lives. 

This awakening leads to his ultimate decision, to murder the rich family’s patriarch. The social/cultural and wealth divide between classes is so vast that it leads to violence, something that certainly has precedent throughout human history. 

Then, he has to love the same life of isolation that he was willing to force the previous man to live. Is it a karmic force? It seems like he’s atoning more for the agony of the man who lived four years in the basement - not for the man he murdered. 

And of course, his son still fails to understand what it took his father an entire lifetime to get: there is no plan. We’ll never be rich.

There are three levels of poverty in the movie. The basement dwellers, the sub basement dwellers and the house dwellers. Yet someone from each family understands Morse code. Thus showing that there’s still a common language among classes- They are all able to communicate with each other if they really wanted to.

The basement dwelling in the parks home was designed like a maze with all the twists and turns- disorienting making it hard to get out (just like poverty) almost like they were rats trapped in a maze.

In the garrote chase scene: Kevin almost made it out of the maze - he was so close. But when he crossed the line to get out he was viciously pulled back. Implying that no one can escape their circumstances/class.

Also- it doesn’t matter if you are trained/ qualified for a position, it really is all about who you know.  This is evident when the Parks hire the Kims - they don’t really care about credentials only that the Kims were recommended by someone they knew.",dps3xy

f71t22k,"Pinging u/louisbancroft and u/Lokimonoxide for commenting on the only thread about this bit.

The **Taiwanese Shop**.

There are at least two scenes where the subject discreetly takes the spotlight.

* the lunch and the 'driver restaurant', when the Kim family is unraveling the third strand of their scheme. They talk about the time Mr. Kim worked as a driver/valet, sometime between the Taiwanese restaurant and another gig.

* when it's revealed that the maid's husband in the basement also worked or owned a Taiwanese shop. The camera cut to Mr. Kim at that very moment, when the bulk of the Kim family is hiding in the staircase.

u/Lokimonoxide said that it's very characteristic of Korea how volatile trends are over there, with shops coming and going by the turn of the calendar sheet.

However I think it can't be a coincidence. Specially with the camera close-up on Mr. Kim. Their fates were somehow interwoven. Not that we're talking about the same Taiwanese stand here; they're interwoven by sharing a similar misfortune. The movie is equalling the two characters' journey to a degree.

This and the obvious basement dwelling thing. Shared background and predicaments.

Another one, the maid's husband has the utmost *RESPECT!* for Mr. Park, seeing him as a provider. Earlier in the film, Mr. Kim puts Mr. Park at the center of the family blessings when they have lunch at their home and the spiel is similar IIRC. He's painting Mr. Park as a benevolent provider.

I had the pleasure of seeing it at Tallgrass Film Festival a few weeks back, and seeing it with a crowd full of people who were willing to buy what it was selling was an experience. The jokes were legitimately hilarious! The violence was legitimately shocking!

This is the first Korean film since The Handmaiden that feels like it's made a splash in the American theater circuit, and it's a hell of a good starting point if you're just getting into Korean film. Beyond this film's individual strengths (which plenty of people will talk about), it's exciting to see theaters in small cities have so many showings for a foreign film.

f6yibrd,"Some thoughts after watching the movie. 

The father hinted at being the fuckup throughout the movie. First with the pizzabox where one in four would go wrong, the push down the stairs revealing all the other family members, throwing the water which hits his son in the face, always looking back while driving and almost crashing in one scene. Especially the scene of the dad getting the son in the face. It was foreshadowing how his later “fuckup” would lead to his son getting the rock hit on his head

It seemed water was a recurring theme to show the descent into craziness. The water splashing onto the son, how the son stood on the stairs wanting to change things but continuing down the stairs as if he’s getting pushed with the current of craziness, the house flooding and the family losing their things and their grip on their livelihood. 

Also thought it was clever when the daughter is sitting on the toilet where she can’t get any of the water on her. Hinting at how she’s dead later above all the shit that is occurring below on earth. 

Also pointing out how during the flood that plans never really work out because of things that you can’t plan around in life. Much like how they planned out the whole con on the family but lost their grip on the situation, how the dad made a plan but the escape ruined his plan before he could get to it, and finally how in the end the son makes a plan but most likely reality will get in the way of this plan as well.

There was also the theme of class. The rich were nice but never truly cared about the poor. The scene of the rich couple getting off while the poor family were right below them stuck under the table. Clearly shown when the rich dad chose his son over the ones getting stabbed. It also ties in with how the family were likely to resort to conning and would be nice if they were rich. But clearly wouldn’t truly be nice at heart after treating the dog that way a second later",dps3xy
fh9n1z9,"As a Korean, watching this movie gave me a horrible sense how just how separated the social classes are. When the family was fumigated in the beginning, it was a comparison to them being seen as bugs, and the mother alluded to this as well when she mentioned something along the lines of ""turn on the light, and the roaches scatter."" 

Mr. Park also talked about how Mr. Kim had a certain smell to him, aka he smelled 'poor' and he hated when it wafted to the back of the car. Mrs. Park also covered her nose when she was being driven by the father to get supplies for the party. 

I think that Mr. Kim ultimately stabbed Mr. Park because of his 'snobby' attitude even in the midst of horrible things. A normal person would've just moved the dead body as quickly as they could to get something from beneath it, but Mr. Park made an effort to plug his nose when moving the man over. The maid's husband practically worshipped Mr. Park every night, although Mr. Park was completely unaware of it. Mr. Kim was probably baffled by the fact that Mr. Park could treat someone who worshipped him like this. Also, Mr. Kim knew he had a certain smell to him, especially when Dasong said he smelled it on Ms. Kim as well. Because of this, I didn't think he was that offended by it, but it was more because of how Mr. Park treated the other man like that. 

Even the sex scene was a mockery of the lower class. Having sex in the back of cars for drugs and other gratification is seen as something so low to the Parks, that it's considered as some sort of taboo. The fact that this is what gets Mr. and Mrs. Park off is actually disgusting. Their mutual distaste ultimately gives them pleasure. They mocked Jessica right in front of her father (which I'm pretty sure they saw him, I don't know how you *couldn't* see Mr. Kim. 

I think that the Parks knew something was going on the entire time. They weren't as dumb as they looked, especially Mrs. Park. She was the ringleader of the entire family, which was very obvious when it came to throwing an impromptu party for Dasong. She pulled all the strings and essentially made everything happen in a few hours, which definitely isn't easy. Also, I don't think she believed that Dasong had schizophrenia, but that he was just really traumatized from seeing a ""ghost."" (Which was actually really fucking horrifying.) She made a big deal out of this party, and for what? Dasong woke up and it was sunny in their ***climate controlled*** backyard? That means that everything is fine now? 

On the topic of Dasong, I don't think he knew about the man living in the basement. The morse code spelled out H-O-L-P M-E, and as a kid, I'm not sure he knew what it meant, especially since it was in English. He was sounding it out, which most Korean children know how to sound out English letters and words, but he didn't know what it meant. 

Anyway, back to my original point. When I used to walk home from school in Korea, I remember walking by semi-basements and shabby, cramped houses. My home wasn't much better, but I remember feeling the same disgusting, wondering how someone could live down there. It says a lot about how even those who aren't much more wealthy still look down upon the poor.",dps3xy
fhqy52p,"I know I'm late to the party, but I recently just watched the movie and there was one particular scene that really stood out to me. When Mr. Park was essentially auditioning the dad for the driver position, you see Mr. Park looking down at his cup and it cuts to the cup. 

For me, this scene is significant because it really highlights the point that the family are exceptionally competent at their jobs, but have never gotten the opportunities to find work likely due to class barriers. 

This is something I learned from my father, but there's a saying that the best drivers will never spill a drop of water from the king's cup. When Korea still had a king, the king's driver supposedly would be tested in a similar way where the driver had to make turns and stops without spilling a drop of water in the back seat. It's supposed to highlight how good your control is. The dad is extremely competent as noted by the fact that the coffee (tea?) barely even sloshes around the entire trip.

I think the other significance behind the scene is the fact that it may be Bong Joon-Ho's way of saying that in modern korea, the rich like Mr. Park are the equivalent of modern kings and queens, with the common working class the status of servants.

It's a really cool detail that is probably obvious, but definitely has even more impact once you understand the full context of it.",dps3xy
fico55q,"I have no idea if this has already been said but for me the tipping point for Mr. Kim came from the fact that Mr. Parks looked down upon the crazy light guy (disgusted by his smell) because, metaphorically, he didn’t realize how much his own comfort depends on him. Mr. parks thinks that the lights turn on automatically for him, representing that he views the comforts of his life as a product of his own hard work and good fortune but in reality his comforts are built on the pain and suffering of someone in one of the worst living conditions imaginable. And yet despite this man being a building block for Mr. Park’s success, Mr. Parks is disgusted by him, partially because he has no conscious knowledge that even exists. This a clear metaphor for the rich not realizing, in fact being completely ignorant, that their comfortable lives are literally built on the backs of those that they look down upon. Crazy light guy is living in mr parks basement and serving mr parks and mr parks is completely unaware. Mr. Parks isn’t an evil man, he is just ignorant and blinded by the system because the system has favored him and capitalism supports the “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” mentality that hails hard work and perseverance as the only prerequisites to success, not acknowledging that such success comes with a cost to those that, though equally hard working, did not have the luck or fortune for success. 

I have more thoughts that would take a while to write about the implications of crazy light guys adoration of mr parks and attacks on those of the low class, just like him, rather than the rich that I’ll add later as well. I’m not quite sure yet how to unpack mr Kim going from murdering mr parks for his ignorance and disdain for those that literally enable his life of luxury to be possible and then essentially turning into another adoring and invisible subservient peon, just like crazy light guy was; but I feel like theres a lot of important symbolism there.",dps3xy
fj1lbeu,"Here’s my take on [\#Parasite](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/parasite?source=feed_text&epa=HASHTAG) and the meaning behind the symbolism and the characters. So SPOILERS ALERT obviously.

The first and most important object is the scholar’s rock or the suseok. Some may see it like a good luck charm. It may even seem like a meaningless plot device. But actually, the suseok represents mother nature itself and how humans should live in accordance with the principles of nature.

Nature is revered by Koreans in their livelihood since a long time ago. Even though nowadays South Koreans are mostly Christians, Buddhist, or Catholics, the indigenous religions of Korea, be it shamanism or Confucianism were centered on harmony with nature.

Now the suseok are shaped and formed exclusively by nature, free from human intervention. It represents the beauty and power of living up to one’s true potential, talents or strengths while accepting one’s weaknesses as part of one’s identity.

Take note that the suseok has a custom made base as it was given by Min-hyuk. This symbolizes how Min-hyuk's grandfather honors nature, decorating and paying respect to it. Making it a prized possession.

This combination of naturally shaped suseok and custom made base represents the Kim family's unorthodox way of living and getting work (Ki-woo convincing the Pizza girl to hire him as an employee).

The problem with the families (yes including the previous housekeeper’s) is they didn’t live up to their full potential nor do things naturally. They’re not evil or malevolent. They’re just lost and are not in touch with their true selves.

The Kims: They’re capable, talented even. Ki-Jeong in art & graphic design, Ki-woo is diligent in studying, he’s also a smart strategist and suave, Chung-sook is a hammer throwing medalist, Ki-taek is a fast learner and great driver.

But the Kims resorted to menial jobs. Ended up conning the Parks and kicking the driver and housekeeper from their jobs, even though they’re NOT under any life-threatening situation or pressure. They’ve been disappointed by their own failures and just wanted the easy way out. They became parasites of the rich, taking advantage of the Park's resources and gullibility. These people became parasites because they can.

The Parks seems like nice people at first glance. But they didn’t live up to their full potential too, let alone living in harmony with their environment or nature. Their cold and very geometric house is proof of that.

The signature garden of the movie was so flat and empty. This was even “glorified” during Ki-woo’s first visit. This represents “emptiness” or “void” and the Park’s disharmony with nature. The automated sprinkler shows that it’s meaningless to water such an empty garden.

Korean gardens are natural, informal, asymmetrical, unforced, trying to blend with the natural world. Medium sized suseoks play a big role in this too, becoming inseparable major decorative elements in those gardens. Yet in their garden, there are none. Just an empty grassy garden made for man-made activities such as Da-song’s birthday party. The lack of suseok stones or any kind of natural arrangements in their garden symbolizes the absence of natural order in the Park's life.

This emptiness runs in the family too. Their tendency to use English names like “Nathan” and “Kevin”, shows their social-climbing tendencies.

Mr. Park or Nathan’s unwillingness to drive himself, intense dislike of body odor, & doesn’t like people who cross the line shows he’s not used to taking the commute or working and building his career from the ground up. He was born and raised rich.

Choi Yeon-gyo using English words, being impressed with western things, while not having any skills, be it professional or domestic means she got rich by marrying Mr. Park. She is a nouveau riche.

Da-hye not having good grades, but her mother implies that it doesn’t matter and will get into a good university anyway. This is a direct opposite of Ki-woo, who kept failing university exams even though he’s actually smart (but lacking vigor).

Da-hye’s having it easy with life. But her brother is even more favored compared to her. This is proven by the Ram-don not being offered to her & she wasn’t asked to participate in Da-song’s birthday event, yet Jessica was.

Speaking of Da-song, he’s the only one being in tuned with his talents and nature – painting. But the rest of the Parks think he’s strange and too wild. They want to nurture him, but they don’t really understand him.

Da-song represents the inner child that most people trying to repress. He’s the heart of the family that makes his father laugh, the one that likes simple happiness in the form of Ram-don or jjapaguri. A “commoner’s” comfort food. (albeit with a sirloin topping).

The Parks, with all their resources and social status, are parasites of the meek and poor. They need the poor's obedience and labor / manpower to do domestic jobs and daily things The Parks should've been able to do themselves. They became parasites because they think they're entitled or privileged to be one.

Gook Moon-gwang the housekeeper and her husband never said anything about saving up and paying off the debt collectors. She just kept on supporting her husband’s life, living in the bunkers as a “ghost”. They’ve been living out of the natural order too. Now these two became parasites because they are forced to.

The Kims, the Parks, and the housekeeper husband and wife represent natural order gone wrong. They think it's only natural to do what they've been doing. In reality, they twist things to fit their needs. Remember what Ki-taek said to Ki-woo when they had to spend the night with the other flood refugees? He said that not having a plan in life is the best way. Well this is a very twisted and wrong way to see the natural order of things. There will always be challenges in life, we will fail, a lot. But the important thing is to adapt, to rise up, and walk forward again.

Now back to the suseok and natural things. Bong Joon-ho deliberately wants the rock to float during the flood. Why? Cause through Ki-woo’s eyes, the rock’s nature and purpose has been twisted. As a savior, and a murder weapon. Something he needs to do to “set things right.” Note that from this point the custom made base is removed. It's no longer revered. Nature and harmony are no longer respected or look up to.

The rock fell down the bunker stairs and was eventually used against him. This represents natural order gone haywire, about things not happening the way we want it. The literal crushing weight of reality.

Though after the whole incident, the suseok was returned to a river or pond, this time it sunk to the bottom. I think we can safely assume it's Ki-woo himself who returned it. This reflects his willingness to accept reality and let things take course naturally. Do things the right way, i.e. working hard to get money and buy the house the legit way.

In the end, the contrasting shot between the opening and ending, a Bong Joon-ho signature, is meant to show what Ki-woo should’ve done. To do things based on his talents, his gifts, and to do it the natural way.

But it’s all too late, at that moment, in a snowy night, Ki-woo realized that no matter how hard he tries, he just couldn’t make his fantasy a reality. In Bong Joon-ho's words, it's a ""surefire kill"" (확인사살). #Parasite 's Moral of the story: don’t mess with nature or its order. Once it messes with you, you’re done for.

Sorry for the long post, but do think Bong Joon-ho made a very deep movie with so many symbolism, hidden meaning, moral messages, and interpretations.",dps3xy

ff5bb20,"After watching the movie, I spend some time thinking over the title. Who is the parasite? Is it the Kim Family (representing the poor)? or the Park Family (the rich)? Choosing one over the other does not seem right. One comment suggests that it is actually the House. This, imo, is the root cause. The House symbolizes the society, which causes (imo) the reciprocal parasitic relationship between the rich and the poor, where not only the poor needs the rich to survive, but also the rich needs the poor to maintain their lifestyle. Instead of solely critiquing one side of the class, I believe this movie actually criticizes the System that supports and perpetually sustains the ongoing wealth disparity. In another word, it’s one superb movie indeed.",dps3xy
ffptnvl,"What a great film. And to those questioning it as if we are ""supposed"" to root for the family or etc ....

We aren't supposed to unite under some proletariat mantra. I think we are to see that the wealthy cannot forever avoid the Carnage and violence upon which they thrive. 

They don't actually buy the house. That's a pipedream that may or may not happen. The father is banished to the underground, just as he had been in the semi-basement, yet worse, since that's what he thought of the other man who was forced to dwell down there. He didn't actually overthrow a damn thing - he just raged and caused a moment of chaos to disrupt the status quo, but the status quo keeps going. 

This movie was amazing. 

I never felt bad for the family regarding their cons or their killing, nor did I want them to succeed in the con ultimately....but I did feel bad when their house flooded with sewage. Which I think is telling about how we feel bad for things ppl cannot help, like poverty, yet condemn them for crimes and deciet nonetheless. This seems innate to human beings. We don't like them as they are drinking like thieves and acting irresponsible, although we really can't blame them at all either, and might very well do the same if it were us. 

Brilliantly as far as a thriller, we root against them being discovered just for the pure awkwardness it would create, just as we cringe at the very real sex scene and how personal it is, being witnessed by strangers. This taps our human nature in a way that does not have to dumb it down into bad guys vs good guys....

At the end, I felt the film was cyclical and in a realist tone. I did not feel bad for the family or happy for them or etc. After all, the daughter, who wanted to offer a truce, and was pretty clever, died in a pool of her own blood and the father lives in a bunker not sure his son will even get his message which he sends every night.

Thankfully I had no idea where the story was going to go next after the maid come back, the twist being that someone's been living inside a secret dirty bunker for over 4 years in a rich family's home is weird but weirdly believable.

I finally got around to watching this movie and it was fantastic, however, after reading some other reviews about it, I kinda got a different message from it than a lot of people.  

I read some reviews that outlined its portrayal of the lower class and their struggles to get by, gatekept by the upper class, only able to find work by pretending to be better than they are just to be servants of the upper class. 

I also read some reviews that painted it as derogatory to the lower class and praising of the upper class, portraying the family as dirty and criminal.

However, I took it more as an even commentary less on class and more on wealth and power.  To me, the main thesis of the film is that ""money and power corrupts all"".

There was a key moment in this film that stuck with me that I dont see other people bring up, but in the living room scene, they talk about the son marrying the rich daughter, and then he suggests getting the house because his sister looked like shit ""fit"" in the bathtub.  This was right before everything turned south.  The script kinda left things up to interpretation, but it made the viewer feel like the next people the family aimed to replace in the household was the rich family themselves, taking their wealth and power for themselves.  

Early in the film, we are shown the harsh conditions the family lives in and how hard they have to work just to get by, which was then juxtaposed by how easy life was for the rich family who just hired everyone to do their work for them.  As the audience, we are conditioned to feel sorry for the poor family and resent the rich family.  However, this is all turned on its head in the living room scene. 

To further drive this message home, the poor family went to murderous lengths to keep their guise up because they didnt want to loose the wealth and power they gained.

In the end, the message I got from the movie was that the ambition for wealth and power should not supersede one's ambition for life itself, as it's destructive nature ruins the lives of the same people that think that money and power is all they need.",dps3xy

fn5u0zh,"Just watched this for the first time and HOLY COW it was amazing. 

One point I saw that I haven’t seen discussed here is the basement guys worship of Mr Park.

Yet the worship continues day after day after day.",dps3xy
f69x3z7,"This is building off some things I’ve read in this thread, but the commentary on our capitalist system and class dynamics is astounding...

The rich are oblivious while the poorest of society have to battle amongst themselves for jobs and income. Occasionally, there will be a temporary chaos that shocks the system and even gets the attention of the rich (the bloodbath at the end).  But at the end of the day, everything returns to its original state. Kevin and his mother are in poverty. Mr. Kim is the next poor man (parasite) who lives in the bunker, and a new rich family moves into the house.

It is bleak and crushing and an incredible bit of commentary.",dps3xy
f73nmke,"A lot of this movie was absolutely insane and beautiful at the same time, as I’m sure everyone who saw it knows.

There are so many levels of symbolism I can’t get over. With the whole “poor people fight and kill each other for scraps of wealth” theme, little things stuck out. When the Kim basement flooded, the neighbour asked for help but was quickly rejected. No conversations ever took place with another member of the “needy” (outside of the neighbour one-liner, and the basement couple). No cashier, no other driver, nor anyone on street was ever heard from, whereas we see clearly the people of the Park circles and hear from them on occasion as well. 

I think a key message generally was that, even though all these terrible things are said and done, there are moments of good that peek through, are sought after, and felt lightly, going unnoticed often because the audience is so focused on the negative.

Kevin’s friend at the start offering him a job out of respect (and probably pity). Mr Kim’s concern for the former driver for a short moment, having been in similar situations himself (and probably out of pity).",dps3xy
f8di3mi,"Parasite is not a horror movie, just in case you’re worried about the film’s name. It could be a dark comedy. Or a satire. Or a thriller. Or a drama. The film shifts through all of these genres so seamlessly, and tone changes happen at the blink of an eye but never seem too out-of-place. It touches on class differences (upper-class versus the poor) in Korea without ever blatantly criticizing any of them specifically. Parasite is merely a film of observations, strung together in the most entertaining way. If you want to watch this, it’s best not to watch any trailers or read any plot synopsis!

There are so many brilliantly executed scenes in there that it's just impossible to not give it repeated viewings. The set design is pretty great and fits to the script's needs. All the actors did a splendid job but the actress who played Mrs. Park is my favorite. The first half of the film is just perfect while later half though not on the same level is great too. That final shot is haunting. 

There's little to complain here, aside from some minor plot contrivances this is a near perfect film. Film of the year and one of the best this decade. ",dps3xy

fe6igig,"Saw the movie again recently, with the benefit of others insights since my first viewing. Had some stray observations.

\-Right off the bat, Min says that Mrs. Park is ""simple"". As the movie plays out, it really is emphasized over and over; she's introduced sleeping in the yard and has to be woken up. She puts up an intimidating face for Ki-Woo, but she's almost immediately impressed once he puts on a show for her(checking Da-Hye's pulse, acting very confident). Overall, she's the recipient for a lot of the manipulation from the Kim Family. From reading/misreading synopses before my first viewing, I thought that the Park family was the one with the secret and creepy backstory.

\-Plans are mentioned a lot more than I remember, almost like arc words. Lots of ""according to plan, not according to plan"". I only really remembered the scene in the shelter when discussing plans. But when the benefit of repetition, the theme of plans gets reinforced. Additionally, you see how important Ki-Taek is right from the getgo; one of the first things his family asks is ""what is his plan?""

\-Does anyone know if the English subtitles vary? I felt like there were some subtleties missed on second viewing, but maybe it's just me.

\-Interesting how both the Kim Family and Moon Gwang try to seek some kind of moral high ground. For the Kim Family, using loan sharks seems pretty reprehensible which seems to be one of the reasons why Chung Sook seems so unsympathetic. But of course, the Kim family themselves have been embarking on this massive deception and cost two people their jobs.

Overall, I didn't learn too many new things, but existing observations and other observations from commentators have been reinforced for me a lot more.

To me, it represented how the lower class works tirelessly for people with power and wealth, even going so far as to deify them for their status. And for what? To live in squalor, eating scraps and struggling to survive while the rich live a luminous life off the backs of the working poor?

And yet, remove the worker and what would happen? The lights would go out.",dps3xy
fftod0w,"For me, perfect until the epilogue.   The opportunity for a more elegant ending missed in my opinion.  Here is how I would have ended it...

Kim Ki-taek kills Mr. Park, and runs off.  That I would have kept the same.  However, I would have made the only other survivor of the main family Park Chung-sook.  In order to avoid getting caught and losing her position (which without her family, she would have needed to survive), she would have to continue the facade, tragically denying her children even in their deaths.  This way, she would continue to be the housekeeper for the widowed Mrs. Park and her children.  

Then in a poetic final few scenes, the house is sold, and Park Chung-sook insists to remain with the house as part of the sale to the new family (in the same way the old housekeeper was).  In the final scene, the housekeeper takes a plate of food at night, and slips into the dark entryway to the basement, letting the audience know that not only is Kim still alive, but he is living in the basement of the house.  History repeats itself.  We are part of a system the traps us generation after generation in the place we are, even though it creates the illusion of upward mobility.  With that being said, it also shows us that if we try and take power through violence (Kim killing Mr. Park), we end up trapped where we once were (in the basement), often with tragic consequences (losing both children).",dps3xy

f7cpa8j,"All I can say is wow. This film is a rollercoaster of emotions and truly a masterpiece. Definitely one of my top 10 favorite movies ever. I was very on edge the entire time as the lies and deception continued to get deeper, culminating in the big reveal of what was in the basement. That scene where they first descended into the abyss was so claustrophobic and nerve-wracking, I was having a hard time catching my breath.

I think I caught most of the obvious metaphors and some of the more subtle ones, but after reading so much about the movie and comments in this thread I've realized Parasite has so many more layers than I originally thought! It's a delicious layer cake of a film where every note hits perfectly.

All the performances were incredible, but my favorite part is definitely the ""Jessica Jingle"" when Ki-jeong first comes to the Park house. Park So-dam is adorable and her song is just too catchy! (I also learned this melody is a folk song used as a mnemonic device, which is pretty cool and makes sense.) It also helps that I'm from Chicago which is where Jessica claims to have studied. For those who don't know, they released it as a ringtone on the official Parasite website.

Another scene I really enjoyed was the one where she was sitting on the overflowing toilet smoking a cigarette as the Kim house was flooding. A few people have commented on this as a metaphor of it's own, but as far as her character goes I mainly saw this as her accepting their fate and having a moment to be herself. It must be exhausting to play the professional and strict character of Jessica most of the time. Ki-jeong was taking a break from her character and the crazy events that just transpired, while sighing and accepting that their family most likely screwed up another opportunity they had to escape from poverty.

The ending was fantastic and emotional. What really had me in tears was Ki-jeong's funeral and then Ki-woo's letter to his father where he told him, ""You just have to walk up the stairs."" My god, what amazing film making. I understand that Bong Joon-ho typically takes a pessimistic approach in his storytelling. Despite this, I feel hopeful that Ki-woo might be able to build a successful career and one day purchase the house and free his father due to the vigor inside himself.

RIP Ki-jeong, you didn't deserve such a cruel fate.

2. When Kiwoo was tutoring the daughter, she was telling him that Dasong is faking his inspiration and just pretends to look up at the sky. Was there a specific reason for this? Or is it simply to show that he is a favorite among the parents?

Throughout the movie we see the rich screwing over the poor and the poor screwing over the poorer (like Mr. and Mrs. Kim taking pride in at least being partially above ground - see Mrs. Kim telling the former housekeeper that she isn't needy) - and I think the most common interpretation (at least based on a lot of reviews/articles I've read about the film) of this is how rampant capitalism drives people to strife and all sorts of unpleasantness. 

But my thought while watching this is that it's not necessarily just capitalism or money, it's just innate greed. The Kims could have stopped any time. Presumably the son and the daughter were making good money tutoring, they didn't have to jeopardize the driver or housekeepers' jobs. Getting a little was not enough, they wanted it all.

As I see it, (and I guess this is kind of cynical), the issue isn't capitalism or money - the issue is the innate human nature to always want more. There's a reason why communism never worked out - it's because people are inherently flawed and aren't ever satisfied with what they have. People are selfish, and this is reflected in how the world works. The problem isn't money or capitalism, the problem is people.

I guess to summarize, I'm a little annoyed by some of the ""HURR DURR LATE STAGE CAPITALISM, AMIRITE"" reactions to this film when I see capitalism as a symptom of the human condition, not a foreign concept derived by purely the rich to put down the poor.",dps3xy

fdaf7xm,"I’ve seen this film twice now, love it. But the one thing I’m still struggling to grasp is Ki-Woo/ Kevin’s “and I just kept laughing” monologue at the end.

I was absolutely floored by the reveal of the bunker. I was totally fine with this just being a movie about a family ingratiating themselves with another, and I expected the Kims to ultimately make a move to completely replace the Parks (especially with the phone call asking for the deed, financial statements, etc.). NOPE! The movie certainly telegraphs that plot, but then sharply turns in a completely different direction.

Ki-taek runs down to the basement immediately after stabbing Mr Park, at which point the last time he saw his son he was unconscious and apparently dead; and the last time he saw his daughter, she was stabbed/bleeding but still responsive. At the end, Ki-taek send the coded letter to Ki-woo, saying he is sad every time he thinks about Ki-jeong. But how does he know which of them survived?

fdsj1xi,"I'm very late to this party, I really enjoyed the pacing of this movie and how it escalated. There was an energy from the very beginning that just hooked me right in until the very end. So many things stood out to me as symbolic and metaphorical in this movie (maybe/probably connections I made in my own head). There's so many insights in this thread I had never even thought of and I love connecting those dots. 

As the movie progresses the facade of the Kims begins to crack. In my experience everyone has their own unique smell that is tied to their home and this is what I believe Mr Park was referring to when he expresses his disgust. In my understanding the film was highlighting that a person can change everything about themselves, forge as many documents as they like but they will never be able to change where they come from. When Mr Kim realizes this and identifies with the previous housekeepers husband this begins to send him over the edge. The further escalation and his lack of a plan led to the resulting attack. The smell also reflects the escalation of the movie as the overflowing sewer and the fact they all stayed in the gym, presumably resulted in a far worse scent from the Kims at the birthday party.

When Jin comes to visit at the very beginning, I felt he was the only real positive character in the movie. He handed 'Kevin' a great opportunity and put his reputation on the line for him with the Kims singing his praises. Taking advantage of this opportunity to the extreme measures that they did showed to me that the Kims are responsible for their own fate. 'Kevin' even began a relationship with the Park daughter, in my view taking advantage of the neglected girl and betraying his friend. If he had just been honest and followed the plan he had mentioned to his father this situation could have been avoided. 

In multiple scenes in the Kims house a hanging drying rack with socks hangs in the top of the frame. The socks don't seem to change even after Ms Kim and 'Kevin' return home. The comment about Ms Kim having to wash her daughter in law's socks felt to me as if it was a symbol that the Kims were always underneath the Parks, even if 'Kevin' thought he and his family fitted in. 

The scenes where the Kims escape the house and run home signified two things to me -

1. As they run down the hill the rain is pouring down the steps from the upper class area which reminded me of the expression 'shit rolls down hill'. The lower levels of society have to deal with the shit the upper levels don't want and they get no choice.

2. The rain pouring and overflowing sewage system floods the house filling it with sewage. This to me linked back to the guy peeing in the street outside their home. This incident had increased to an extreme stage just like the jobs at the Park's home ultimately destroying everything which may be a hint of foreshadowing. Towards the end of the movie where Ms Kim is scrubbing the furniture after they return home as herself and her son return to poverty and try to move on. 

Ultimately I felt the movie showed the inequality and demotivation that is associated with poverty in a complex manner, showing that sometimes people are also a victim of their own choices. I really enjoyed this and the character depth shown throughout with no person being a one dimensional.",dps3xy
ff53pb9,"Big thread, might get buried, but I felt like sharing a couple items I found interesting. Some of this is credit to my wife, who is Korean and noticed (and read about) a few Easter eggs of sorts that I didn't. Obviously **SPOILERS** ahead.

- The movie went through another titles during development, the french word ""Decalcomanie,"" which means means something like ""transference"" (normally in the context of art).
- The movie also had as a working title ""Happy Together,"" with the tag line ""happiness expands when shared."" This was discarded because some other Korean show earlier used the title.
- The Korean spelling of the movie's name is a pun on the names of several characters. The first syllable ""ki"" is a pun on Kim Ki Taek, Kim Ki Woo and Kim Ki Cheung, the father, son and daughter of the Kim family. The second ""saeng"" is similar to the Korean word for three, which I suppose references the three Kims noted before. The last syllable is ""chung"", which references Ms. Kim (Chung Sook). 
- The Hanja for Mr. Kim's name means something like ""to build a house from the foundation up."" Obviously an ironic reference to the fact that he lived in a semi-basement and ended up in complete bombshelter basement.
- The Hanja for Kim Ki Woo (""Kevin"") means something like ""to worry."" It's also phonetically similar to something like ""wishing for rain."" Presumably a pun on the rain references in the movie.
- The Hanja for Kim Ki Jeong (""Jessica"") means something like ""pre-determined fate."" Presumably a reference to the fact she dies.
- The designer's name ""Namgoong"" is the same name as the character played by Mr. Kim in the movie Snow Piercer.
- Back in late 2016 there really was a ""Cake Store Crisis"" in Korea. Lots of bakeries capitalizing on the trendiness of cakes, which collapsed when the trend died out (exacerbated by reports of disease-carrying eggs used in cake production).
- The song ""Jessica"" used as part of her quasi-mnemonic for remembering her cover story prior to the interview uses the melody of a patriotic Korean song. Maybe something here because of the later references to North Korea.
- ""Kevin's"" name is chosen because apparently it was the name of a person who gave Mr. Park an award. There's a certificate to this effect in the home. It also reveals Mr. Park's English name to be Nathan.
- The garbage can used in the bloody napkin scene is some kind of trendy, very expensive garbage can that is known for silent opening/closing.
- The chimp/""self-portrait"" drawing is presumably meant to be a drawing of the ""ghost"" (really, the basement husband). In the bottom right of the painting is a darkened zone (a basement) with a yellow arrow pointing up from it, indicating the ""ghost"" leaving the basement. This painting was in reality drawn by an adult Korean artist, who was also an extra during the climactic birthday party scene.
- Bugs showed up three times in the movie - once the stinkbug at the start, once the reference to cockroaches, and once the fly on the basement husband's corpse. All three times are in proximity or reference to Mr. Kim, who is haunted by the idea that poverty has innately tainted him.
- Pretty obvious but the semi-basement dwelling referenced how low on the ladder they were. At the start, they reach up for wifi, paralleling their attempt to reach ""upwards"" to leech resources (the entire point of the movie). Similarly, they constantly show rainwater running downstairs, literally flooding poor homes, while the rich Parks merely enjoy rain at their high-elevation manor.
- The ram-don they make is made of two types of cheap noodles combined with expensive sirloin. The raman used is expressly shown to be cheap. Presumably references the two poor families (Kim, basement folks) and the one rich family (Park) living in the same house.
- The names chosen for the basement family, the wife's ability to imitate a famous North Korean news anchor, and the husband's obsession with blind respect to his imagined-lord (Mr. Park) may suggest North Korean defector backgrounds.
- In the basement, on the cans, there were many pictures of old politicians (including Nelson Mandela and Lincoln). One of the prominent ones was the president of South Korea during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Obvious connection to the central theme of capitalism/wealth disparity.",dps3xy
ffrv790,"I really liked how the movie pitted a poor family against another poor family, just like how certain low-income demographics are demonized to other low-income demographics in order to keep the rich out of the equation as the reason for their struggles.

f669c9y,"I missed part of the beginning of the movie because I dropped my wallet on the way to the theater and had to go find it. So I may have missed some of the context that explains my question.

Why did the main character sit for college entrance exams and never go to college? Was it just implied he couldn’t go to college? It was my understanding that South Korean colleges were relatively inexpensive, based on what I’ve heard from international students.

Also, it was sad seeing how the lower class were essentially living like vermin: wading through sewage, scuttling around in the dark unseen, living off stolen scraps of food.",dps3xy
f676219,The whole sequence from the reveal of the bunker to the Kims having to escape (especially when they're hiding under the table and shit) is among the most suspenseful filmmaking I've ever seen.

f69e0hu,"Props to the actor that played the housekeepers husband, he was so scary and played a man going insane so well.",dps3xy
f6a47os,"I see other people asking about the floating wish rock.  Do we know how dense and porous the rock is?  Could the sewage water be denser than the rock?

The Kim family as a parasite to the Park family is fairly blatant especially with the cockroaches hiding under the table pointed out by other people.  A smarter person could probably make a coherent analogy of the Kim family being an invasive species but I will try.  The son, daughter, and father could be seen as drones/soldiers who eventually come into conflict with the established Queen, Gook Moon-gwang, and force her out so that their Queen can set up the colony.  It seems almost fitting that the new Queen kicks the old Queen down the stairs which eventually leads to her death.

Overall, I think the film does a good job at making the characters humanly relatable to a point.  Ki-woo getting the job that Min felt he was qualified to do could have been enough but he saw an opportunity for his sister to get a job.  Her art tutor/therapy BS was a respectable hustle to get her paid.  I take issue with her setting up the young driver, Yoon, to get fired.  The Kim family try to ease any guilt they might have by saying Yoon is young and will bounce back.  The discovery of the cheap underwear might have got Yoon blacklisted in the driving community.  I didn't respect the premeditated and multistep plan to get the housekeeper fired by exploiting her allergy to peaches.  They  know how severe her initial reaction to peaches would be so they could have killed her.  As someone who has an epinephrine pen for my shellfish allergy, I take these things seriously.

>You know that fuzz on the peach skin? If she's anywhere near it, she gets a full body rash, has trouble breathing, asthma, a total meltdown!

Having lived in basement apartments when my family was in a lower economic bracket made me relate to the Kim's.  We even had minor flooding.

The Park family was mostly inoffensively rich and ignorant to certain ills in life due to their wealth.  The wife being happy about the rain while the Kim family had to deal with property damage, potential infection from sewage water in their apartment, and displacement was \*possibly\* a motivator for Mr. Kim to snap.  The husband and wife roleplaying was possibly another factor.",dps3xy

ff67vwr,"I've been watching this thread nearly from the beginning (and commenting more than my fair share ;) ) and it's only lately that I've realized that **we aren't given a family name for the basement couple.**  We have the Parks and the Kims, but are only given Gook for the original housekeeper's family name (full name of Gook Moon-gwang) and no *official* family name for Geun-se.  Not on Wikipedia, and not in IMDB.  And of course the press info itself doesn't refer to the husband, either, to keep from spoiling his appearance in the story.

Geun-se's family name is not necessarily ""Gook"" like his wife's, because it's common for married couples in Korea to not take the same family name.  (my own in-laws still use their original family names, Kim and Yoon)  That's unlike Western societies, where the usual practice is for the wife to take her husband's family name.

Someone else has alluded to one or both of the basement couple as being defectors from North Korea.  I'll also assume for now that his family name is the same as hers (and if it is, somebody tell me where it's written down).  Maybe this missing name is part of that puzzle...?",dps3xy
ff695et,"I just have to say. WOW. That film had me going through so many emotions, I don't think a think has done for many a year. If I was going to vote for it in the Oscars, I'd give it Best Film, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Foreign Film. I would have given  Song Kang-ho, a nod for Best Actor or supporting Actor. Did anyone else get the vibe that this is something that David Fincher would have done.

For a moment there, I thought the twist was going to be that either stupid rich wife (she pulls a Keyser Soze) or her daughter and the army buddy of Ki-woo who asked him to take over his position were cahoots to do over her husband and that Ki-Woo and his family would have taken the fall for it at the end. That's what I was expecting. But it totally went agaisnt were I thought it go. I'm definitely with everyone who said to go in not knowing a thing  about this.

It's definitely a cast type of film and well deserving of the ensemble cast award they got at the SAGS, it isn't like a one man or woman show although I thought the always great Song Kang Ho as the Dad (especially in the last 30 minutes or show is some of the best acting I've seen) and Cho Yeo-Jeong as the dumb rich wife (can't believe she's 38 in real life, she's looks like she's in her 20's), were standouts. But no one from the cast was none other then excellent.

The ending, I look at it as somewhat hopefully even in his downbeatness. Heartbreaking stuff. I thought when Ki-Woo was buying the house at the end, it was going to be a happy ending but Bong Joon-Ho pulls the rug from under you. I had a feeling it was going to get bloody, these South Korean filmmakers love to ratchet up the violence or shock final thirds. I thought Ki-Woo was dead or brain damage by getting smashed in the head with the stone. But the sister dying shocked me.

I was little worried that cause of all the hype that it wouldn't live up to it's hype (a bit like Greta Gerwig's Ladybird a few years back) but I have to say it exceed the hype.",dps3xy

So, who is the parasite? The rich took the work of the poor to the point it felt it was entitled. Come when we want. We pay you extra. Respect. Cross the line. Who crossed the line? They sucked the life and dignity with no regard to the host. She loved the rain because it cleaned the filth and brightened the day while it destroyed the lives of the poor.

I dont remember a better social commentary on class divide than this film. And it does not paint the rich as evil or poor as saints, infact the rich people are naive, poor are smart and resourceful and when they see a chance to maintain it they dont shy away from stepping on people below them.

The final act is a bit over the top but I see it as the straw that broke camels back, that smell gesture just made Kim Ki Taek snap, again it wasnt justified but he just snapped at the class divide which he could never cross. Its brutal and so hopeless, the Son wants to earn money but that is a bridge too far. The villain in the movie is society and not one person or family. I loved it.

It seems like the housekeeper and her husband had so much more to lose than the Kims, so imho neither would want to rat out the other, sort of a you-keep-my-secret-I’ll-keep-yours deal. 

Why would the housekeeper risk sending the video to the Parks if it meant exposing her secret.

She took really good care of the Park family, the doggies even, and suffered at the hands of the Kim family directly. 

I think her heart was full of love. She called Chung-sook ""Sis"" upon meeting in a genuine, kind manner. Now that I am thinking about it, her and her husband's whole situation, it pretty much puts the Kim family in a terrible light. Maybe not the kids because they expressed their concerns, and tried to help but damn.

fg60pf4,"I hope this is clear, this is my first time writing something on reddit...

There is some discussion on Mr. Kim's statement on how the key is to have ""no plan,"" and I believe this statement is really interesting, especially when considering the family as the main focus of the film. Some people have stated that the father says this, hinting that the son will never be able to follow through with his plan of buying the house, and I would like to add my thoughts on this idea.

Thinking of the idea of a ""plan"" first, planning is clearly something that is key to this film. Whether the family is thrown a wild card (such as the gift of the rock that grants wealth) or creating elaborate plans (such as the hiring of the father and mother), the actions of each individual has a significant impact on what follows. What seems to greatly affect what happens though, is the extent to which the family, and even the poor in general, see themselves and act as a unit. 

For the Kims, it is their moments of unity that allow for great success, particularly in their basement-level home where they plan schemes to become employees of the Parks. In other spaces that allow for this unity, such as the gym they go to after their house is flooded, you can see more instances of the poor can uplift each other as they offer clothes that allow the family to go to the next day lunch. It is not until there are clashes between the Kims and the other staff of the Parks that chaos ensues. Assuming that there is no way they can work together, they fight to the point of even death. In the home of the rich, the Kims are often isolated from each other, unable to plan (as seen during the lunch party, unsure of what to do with Moongwang or her husband), which drives Kevin to act alone, offsetting the downfall of the family. Some foreshadowing of the need for unity, perhaps, could be seen early on in the film, when the family is (albeit willingly) sprayed by the pesticide due to their lack of money. Being unable to see or communicate clearly (all focused on different ""goals""), the family acts separately from each other, causing them to fold a number of the pizza boxes incorrectly. Without unity, there is, at the very least an inability to function (at least well), and at the worst (quite unironically), death. 

Yet, as noted before, there are many times that the characters are unable to work together as a unit, whether it is due to physical or mental constraints. Mr. Kim  is a notable example in this, with his mentality towards planning, as well as his individualistic actions towards the end. He does not believe in planning and as a result, without thinking, he puts a dagger through Mr. Park's chest. He becomes isolated from his family, bidding them ""so long"" as he does not expect to see them again. Perhaps, this is due to his greater experience in the world. Having gone through poverty much of his life, he believes that there is no hope for him, and that he is alone in life now. He contrasts the image he sees in the wealth Mr. Park, who he believes is in a loving relationship with his wife (a clear picture of a happy family). What is interesting though, is the youthful hope that his son has. He writes a letter in response to his father's final farewell, reiterating his ""so long,"" but with the determination to be united as a family again. Though this may not come true, I believe that there may be some truth to this hope. It is Kevin that first receives the rock from his friend, Min. With that rock, he is told that proseperity will come to his family. From that moment, when prosperity hits, Kevin is catalyst that shares such prosperity with his family (first being his sister). As the story continues, he is clearly connected to the rock, with his constantly holding of it, and even survival due to the slight inaccuracy of the last hit from it. Though it can be seen as just a rock, it is a rock through which Kevin is able to set a clear goal and act upon it. It is a rock that not only gives clarity and security to Kevin, but one that is used to unite the family as a whole. Perhaps, because of this, there is something to be said for making plans based on unity, rather than individualist thoughts.",dps3xy

The woman then brings her husband into the house and the two of them take over. The poor are very obviously the villains of that story. They have magic powers and they conjure up plague and sickness and kill the scholar's wife, her children and relatives. But seeing Parasite changed my interpretation of the character's motivations.

I never once knew where the film was going. It does things and goes to places that are fucking insane. I'm so glad I went into this movie knowing absolutely nothing. 

It was actually wayyyyy funnier than I thought it was going to be so that's something. Amazing chemistry between all the actors. Everyone went for it 100%. 

I think it's a powerful statement on class. On the rich vs. the poor. On how oblivious one can be of the other. How we need each other, but also how we should work more together. 

Director Bong Joon-Ho and actor Kang Ho-Song did a Q&A after. Was actually super insightful. Joon-Ho gave really great answers to some bad questions. Seems like a solid dude. One a of kind.

There are two questions that I didn't see at all in the comments—when the Parks' daughter went down to the basement to find Kims' son lying on the ground, did she not see the random open staircase that was never there before in her eyes? Obviously I don't blame her for tending to ""Kevin"" right away, but at some point during what I imagine to be a thorough investigation of the whole murder scene, did she not mention that there was this staircase in the house? I don't know, perhaps she missed it in her state of shock.

My second question might be more nitpicky. Doesn't the housekeeper's husband in the basement get the gag around his mouth tied to a pipe behind him by Mr. Kim, effectively restricting his head? A few beats after we see him thrashing around, it cuts to him (still gagged with the same rag) bashing his head against the light switch.

fhjudhh,"Parasite is probably my favorite movie of the 2010's. It's ability to combine comedy, drama, horror and many other genres seamlessly while subtlety (and sometimes not subtlety) conveying the difference in class between the Kim family and the Park family is impressive. You can really sympathize with every character, and I notice that not many movies can do this quite like Parasite.

What really makes the movie perfect for me is the shift in tone and mood right in the middle. When the former maid showed up at the doorbell camera, I was terrified, and I think what really terrified me was how frantic she was acting and how she looked, compared to the beginning. In the beginning, she seemed completely normal and was completely calm, but it didn't take much for her to go off the rails. I feel like she's a good representation of the movie; it starts out seemingly normal, but then suddenly goes off the rails. But why I say this truly makes the movie perfect, is because of how unsettling the change is. If the movie had started at the middle, you wouldn't completely get that feeling of impending doom. The housekeeper was seemingly normal up until this point in the middle, where she's completely off the rails, knocking the viewers off the rails too.

It's not like the movie was completely normal up until that point. It was still suspenseful, because you knew that something wrong was going to happen in such an elaborate, destructive scheme. But having all the build up was really important to the story.

Just wondering, does anyone have the scene where the son goes into the basement with the rock and gets attacked by the man in the basement? That scene was (in my opinion) the most intense part of the movie and my personal favorite scene. At first, due to the darkness, I thought the guy in the basement had completely tore the skin off his face from smashing his head into the button.

The rich are victimizing the poor.   But the poor also have no recourse to link on to the rich like parasites for basic human needs.  We can say that the Parks are just as guilty as the Kims even though they have not committed any crimes.,dps3xy
fg2qiyu,"This movie was very good, and my only nitpick is that they used the cliche of the homeowners coming back unexpectedly.

fhk042r,"Every performance was incredible, but the standout moment (in terms of acting), was the previous maid realizing she was going to die. It was so sad and haunting.  

My \*only\* gripe with the film (and it's a very small gripe) are the scenes when the Park family are out camping. 

The Kim family has seen again and again that the Park family is incredibly gullible, but they expected that the Parks wouldn't notice missing alcohol, missing food, or any of the mess they made. They never even anticipated that the Parks might return home camping early, which is a bit nuts since they literally were able to anticipate future conversations with the Parks so clearly that they could make a script in preparation. 

When I saw the family all at the Parks house, I scratched my head a bit. When I saw them chowing down and getting drunk, I furrowed my brow. 

Maybe it was an allegory for how money alleviates people problems, and when people don't have problems they don't think things through. How maybe it's that pretending to be rich made the Kim family forget that bad things could happen, because bad things don't really happen to rich people.  

I've also seen a lot of discussion on here saying that the Kim father ""snapped"" when he saw the Park father repulsed by a stench. I wanted to add my two cents. In the span of 24 hours, the Kim had the pseudo luxury life ripped from them by the Parks returning home early, they had to literally physically fight another poor family, and they listened to the Park family talk about their father's smell. You don't do that about people you care about, even a little bit. At least not so dismissively. Then they lost their home, and were all forced to work on a Sunday. The Kim father realized that he will always be poor, and will always be viewed as a service person to the rich. He life, as a poor person, was to serve the rich and hope they paid him enough to live and eat. Seeing the Park father repulsed by the stench was just the last reminder. 

And then the Kim father lived his realization, living in the home of a rich person, eating their food and working hard to never get caught. 

I'm rambling. What a great movie.",dps3xy

f8dk5rp,"A few thoughts:

1) Why did the previous maid have a bloody lip when she came back? The door cam shows it pretty close up, and her husband even comments on it, but I can't remember them giving an explanation for this.

2) Not very realistic that the poor family didn't get caught hiding under the coffee table, with the rich family surrounding it from multiple angles and for hours. I actually was thinking the director left some conflict on the table by not having them or at least one of them get caught, most likely the dad crawling away when they woke up, and with the smell giving him away too.

3) Nice symbolism with the poor family both being fumigated like pests, and scurrying under the furniture when the rich family came home like cockroaches, both downstairs under the coffee table and upstairs under the bed. A point addressed in the dialogue during the film, but I didn't piece it together with their actual hiding under the furniture until my car ride home.

4) Was the poor dad actually angry at his wife when she made the cockroach remark? They play it off like they were joking but I think they just did that to save face in front of their kids when they realized how bad it looked to them.

5) I was also waiting for some other surprises, like that the boy's friend was actually luring the boy to teach English at the rich family's request for some exploitative reason or another. Or that his friend would discover that the boy couldn't be trusted not to mess with the girl he said he was interested in. Or that the rich dad actually did know Morse code and received the messages, but ignored them. (It seems weird that as a tech-savvy person and a homeowner, he wouldn't try to replace the blinking bulb at the very least). Or that the rich family figured out the scheme and that all the workers were related but pretended to play along only to spring a trap later.

I don't know. The whole, ""guy who was trapped in a basement for 4 years without exercise or sunshine and was tied with duct tape overpowers and murderers multiple people"" a bit sudden and unbelievable, and it felt like they didn't resolve some conflict and left other conflict untapped.

I definitely did like the movie though. It's hard to complain too much.",dps3xy

The rich family certainly doesn't appreciate their art, for them it's a status symbol. The only people who could truly enjoy the beautiful house, the music, the sculpted mountain are the basement family, and they never will, because they're stuck in their old-fashioned mentality that keeps them from owning such things or even dreaming of it.

They did nothing wrong, a bit insensitive at times sure but they were just a normal wealthy family. You have to remember when he mentioned the smell, it was in a private conversation with his wife. If I had a driver that smelt bad I would tell someone too. It was just unfortunate that Mr Kim had to hear. And while I empathize with the position of Mr Kim's family and how poverty affects people, it doesn't excuse their actions. 

After finishing the film I remembered Mr Park making the point of crossing lines in regards to conversation barriers but I also understood that as ethical lines too. Up to the point of hooking up the sister with a job I was fine with, but when they started planning on getting the others fired, they crossed the line, and as a result, their lives at the end are much worse.",dps3xy

In the very first scene of the movie, the pizza worker complains to the family that 1/4 of the pizza boxes don't meet their standards.  By suggestion, we understand that the incorrect pizza boxes belong to the father.  Thereby it foreshadows (and sets up) that he is the weakest link in the family.

Fast forward to the scene where we are introduced to the crazy husband in the bunker.

fhbp97m,"Overall, I do think this film is about exploring the endless cycle of poverty, what kind of action it induces in humans as we try to survive, and how your class greatly determines your livelihood. However, I do think moral greys regarding fundamental humane values despite circumstance is explored as well. The original housekeeper hid her husband in the Park's family home without them knowing, but only took what they needed. They treated their property with respect when they were gone, unlike the Kim family, and ultimately tried to live humbly within the safe confinement of a rich person's home. Granted, the husband did overstep by creeping out their poor young boy, but at that point, I feel like he was bordering on crazy for being isolated for so long, and can't fully be to blame for acting out. If anything, it also shows how the homeless, who often have mental illness and can be categorized as ""crazed"" by other people in society, are rejected by society when they try to join everyone else. 

The Kim family were just greedy. Rather than stop with Kim Ki-woo (the son) getting a job that would bring in a substantially higher amount of revenue than they had before, or even stopping with the sister having a job as well, they ruthlessly forced their way into their lives to suck them out of their money for their own personal gain. The Kim family was already seeing an increase in their livelihood, through being able to pay their bills and get higher quality food, and overtime they could have possibly used their funds to find a better home, or help their parents access other resources to find honest jobs. Although the rich family could afford hiring all of them, their greed and their inability to foresee how this could all backfire on them and others was their greatest downfall.",dps3xy

My initial thoughts were that he was going to use it to kill the ex-housekeeper’s husband to keep their secrets safe and therefore secure his family’s future and relationship with the Park’s. But I have seen others interpret the rock gifting as a “peace offering”; since it was given to them by Min initially for hopes of bringing them material wealth, the son wanted to do the same for the husband because he pitied him (?). Would love to hear what others thought about this too",dps3xy

fhrr5pq,"Just watched this and.... WOW

I thought it was a very weird movie, especially during the first scene when they met with the Madame cause she looks like shes hiding something but i was wrong, it was just a simple movie but with a very powerful message (and i also love how the “dark/thriller - comedy” genre worked) 

I literally laughed my fucking ass off when the Parks came home from camping...... and when chung sook just kicked moon gwang casually.

I was also floored when moon gwang came to the room, her weird vibe, and when she was pushing the cabinet (what the fuck is this bitch doing HAHA) and finally revealing the secret room. This was the main struggle of the movie. I originally thought the family would kill the entire park family and take over the house, but no. 

I really hated moon gwang when she videotaped the family, shes also in the same situation so i dont really get the need to blackmail them. But witnessing the typical lower-income attitude in my country, theres no time for alliances cause you really need to survive and get rid of competition.

For the ending, did not expect it would happen at the party. Cause based on the poster, i thought a bloody murder would happen at the park home and thats it. 

Also, what happened to mrs park and her kids? Not that i want justice for them, i need fan theories for that lol haha

And mr kim, i thought the daydream of kevin buying the house was true, but that catch is that mr kim is already dead. 

**And when jessica peach-ed moon gwang, i fucking flipped HAHAHA (this is really where the comedy aspect worked, very subtle and well incorporated in the *very dark* movie. but will really make u laugh)

**And when mr kim stabbed mr park. I really felt his emotion and anger towards mr parks thing with poor people smell, imagine someone dying in front of you and all you can think of is that “smell”. I wouldve felt the same lol

**Personal but i fucking hate da-song, hes the typical annoying kid. Esp when mrs park asked for the fanous japaguri and in the end the fucking kid didnt want it (Im child-free lol)",dps3xy

We know it symbolizes wealth, is supposed to bring prosperity to the family, etc. That by itself just seems ironic given the Kims’ situation.

Towards the end, >!after the flood, Ki-woo says the rock is clinging onto him (as opposed to the other way around). He brings it to the basement to visit the old housekeeper and her husband. The way the rock tumbles down the stairs... it seems like that’s symbolic somehow but I’m not sure how. Geun-sae ends up with the rock and almost kills Ki-woo with it. Did the rock ‘betray’ Ki-woo?

1. Why did the father go on about having no plan? Is this a commentary that poor people need a plan to become rich, or that the poor are more subject to external factors than the rich so plans are useless? 
2. What plan did the son come up with? Why did he bring the rock down to the basement, was he going to kill them?
3. Why did the family ask for all the information to get the housekeeper ""The Care""? I thought maybe they would forge all the documents and take over the house but it went nowhere. 
4. What did the rich husband actually feel about his wife? Just a marriage of convenience or is the a trophy wife?
5. What's the metaphor/symbolism around American Indians? Seems like a major plot device, particularly towards the end as the Dad's are dressed up. 
6. At the end, the son wrote a letter to his father, right? What's the point if there's no way to send it to him? 
7. When the old housekeeper came to the house late at night, she had bruises and cuts on her face, but they never explained why? 
8. How did the sister get the young boy to behave so quickly? He immediately went from running around to bowing. 
9. What are we supposed to take away from the poor son laughing after his brain damage?

1. It is unclear how the little boy from 1 hour of tutoring was able to behave and respond the way he did did too to her. Slightly far-fetched in my opinion considering she only read up about child psychology on Google

2. More confusing to me are the lights. It's a fundamental part of the movie where when when he walks down the corridor man in the basement switches on the lights as if it's sensor monitored however, to think in 4 years these people haven't ever woke up unusually in the middle of the night and walked down to the  corridor without the man man in the basement switching on the light every time seems unreal. Lights in houses are either motion sensored or circuit operated so when the owner of a house hadn't realised something is amiss with the lights seems unrealist considering he's a techno expert.

The Parks literally do not see or hear the underclass, they are invisible, as demonstrated by the multiple scenes in which the Kims are not discovered by the Parks despite being directly within their eyeline. The Parks are not portrayed as clear parasites, but neither are the Kims. Each member of the Kim family is qualified for the job they serve, and they don't steal from the Parks; in fact, both the Kims and the former housekeeper/Man in Basement praise the Parks for their generosity and revere the Parks.

fn6cw18,"Such a great message on class and how people are weighted in the lower/middle but when you reach the top it is cutthroat. Ultimately it is a message of reality and if we could just maybe be better to bring up the bottom and people at the top of the leaderboard just help create a market for all, we'd all be in a better place and not so driven by scarcity and the have and have nots.

The cinematography, sets, characters, direction and overall story 100% deserved the best picture nod.

Everyone is nice, but our structures make for hating one another. The two families trying to live off the rich family is how society is setup. Then you basically have the two poor families nearly killing each other or setting up schemes to take one another down just to service the rich family.

In the end the poor families end up either worshipping the rich family or hating other poor families just trying to survive.

Essentially we have built a predatory competition to service the rich, who may also be nice, and the poor families nice, but the system makes it so cutthroat that you end up destroying each other. Had the two poor families worked together they could have ended up better and also not killed the rich family.

The basement was metaphorically where poor people are put and live off service to rich and scraps. The poor people get frustrated and either end up worshipping the rich or hating them, then usually attacking one another based on these realities.

Overall it was a class metaphor.

The final part where it looked like the kid Woo-sik Choi had success then woke up was a reality check, forever just a dream. Woo-sik Choi would forever carry the weight of poverty as symbolized by the rock that he said clings to him, he can't shake it, it almost killed him, another poor person almost used his weight to kill him just like he almost killed them with it.

then the sister gets there father a job via further manipulation and getting a driver fired (in a economy we see is very hard on drivers, sense the father is still unemployed)

fhh0kei,"*^(I am splitting the comment into three comments because of the text limitations.)* 

I think events and mannerisms in this movie have a perspective dependent duality. If analysed personally, Park family is acting as normal or even kind people. Though if analysed allegorically, poor family as a symbol for lower economical class and rich family for upper economical class, Park family is representing the upper class people's disdain and indifference to the lower class.

# Starting with personal analysis

The ''fake'' politeness is not a guilt on Park family parents's behalf. In fact they can be simply rude at them for being the patrons but choosing not to as mannerly people do. **At least this is what they are thinking**. Not telling your driver he stinks is a courtesy. This is an accurate depiction of how far rich are from understanding the poor.

If your driver smells bad, you might want to share it with your wife. **Park family assumed a superficially -superficially is a significant word here- humble attitude** all the way until the climactic end. Mr. Park was disturbed by Ki-taek's (Kim family's dad) invasive and inappropriate questions about his wife, which he expresses by saying Ki-taek is always acting close to crossing the line, but never patronizes him until the dialogue at the birthday party. And for me, even when he did patronize him, he made his point politely, that he was paid to join the party and should be playing along, not be convinced to do so.  Only in an emergency situation Park family parents show selfishness and that is partly comprehensible from my point of view. Their beloved son can die in about 15 minutes as told in the movie before, there was a terrorising event so they thought and acted like every man for himself. And not only poor people, they also totally ignored the wounded rich friends in shock. This was similiar to gunman situations, would you care about anyone else but your family as a priority when someone is shooting up the place in the same moment?

So looking from their point of view, Park family acted reasonable and fair as individuals.

# For allegorical analysis

Park family parents, **while superficially humble**, were oblivious to Kim's family's struggle just like rich are to poor. Rich acted like poor are unconditional servants. But the real beauty of the depiction is, poor never questioning their roles as servants. Script is full of brilliant sub texts.

Mr. Park ***never cared why*** Mr. Kim smelled. While preparing for the birthday party, he ***didn't realize*** how maid struggled with tables and was grunting under the weight, moreover hushing her because his son was sleeping. Mrs. Park ***didn't care*** if Jessica could make it to the birthday party, she just stated it is important for her son and Jessica will be paid for this, hanging up without giving any time to respond. She cherished the rain and ***was totally oblivious*** to floodings of the poor houses.

And for the poor people, ***while*** Kim family ***had a glimmer of hope living a decent life, they were never objecting*** to any abuse or indifference because that is how exactly life with capitalism works. They were trying to scrounge what they can while ***playing along*** without raising suspicion. They

Bold texts are typical for those social classes. But to me, true success of the script and acting is the rise and fall of that predestinate stonewalled hope, poor people thinking they might be happy one day, only to be heartbreakingly wrong. This hope was beautifully symbolized with the rock given to the family by Min, friend of the Ki-Woo (Kevin).

As one can figure out from my sentences being more subjective while talking about this sub text about hope, I find it very emotional, gut wrenching and sadly universal for all the impoverished people. That's what makes a great piece of art, telling one's story while telling everyone's story.

Just like real life, poor only have the slightest chance to make it out of the constant struggling life which probably will not happen for vast majority.",dps3xy

Just a random hunch, but did Sun kyun use drugs on his wife since she is a simple, and gullible person? 

In that sense, I guess it shows how even relationships between affluent communities can be unstable. In fact, if compared/contrasted between the two different families, you can see how much more unified the impoverished family was.

fisbmha,"Greetings, I'm not very sure if this is the correct place to post this, but I'll do it anyway.

(Spoilers ahead)

So in the ending of Parasite, the father of the Kim family stabs Mr. Park and then goes to the underground hideout.

 But his son was heavily wounded by a rock or something like that, actually in a pool of blood right in the entrance of the hideout. Wouldn't the father have seen his son in that condition?

 And if so, wouldn't he at least grab him to the hideout to treat him? Or in any case, stood by his side after the emotional shock?  


 Maybe there's something I'm missing.

fh86igs,"In South Africa there was this very funny thing that was circulating around black students/young professionals which went something like ""companies wanted degrees from us so that we could get jobs, now that black people got degrees companies started removing them as a requirement"". Obviously that isn't 100% true and that there is a lot that goes into hiring processes of individual companies, but it was a tongue in cheek way of showing that there is another unspoken system running alongside the ""official"" one.

I loved how they showed those subtle obstacles that society puts up which can prevent you from advancing in life. This family had so many skills and tools at their disposal. But as we've seen sometimes in life, and in this movie, a lot of those skills can be useless unless you have the right connections/pedigree.

In that scene where they are getting wasted in the living room, the family had a moment where they saw a future in which everything was alright. The son was going to be ok, because through this family he could get several referrals and be a go to tutor for rich kids, same with his sister. The mom and the dad basically had jobs set for them for life. And it wasn't crazy for him to fantasize that one day he could one day marry Da-hye.

At first I thought them showing all of this was a commentary on capitalism or whatever, but I really kept seeing a commentary on human nature. Like the ""me and people like me should eat first"" mentality that is very present in rich people (the Parks only hiring based on recommendations from fellow rich people) and poor people (the Kims literally screwing over Moon-gwang and the driver kid) alike.

As crazy as they were, I do believe their family had a good heart but had just made really dark (and fucked up) decisions ***just*** so they can survive. After that night of chaos, in the morning the mom and the daughter had a moment where they realized they had acted crazy, amidst the discovery of Moon gwang's husband, and wanted to mend things with them. The father and son even had a moment to think of the driver they had screwed over because they believed they had condemned him to the life that they used to live.

I loved a lot about this movie, the journey was so fun. The climax/ending made what was a very funny journey extremely sad. The whole time I was laughing my ass off at them getting all those jobs I never once stopped to realize that they were cheating and lying to the Parks (they literally wrote a script and rehearsed it lol) and were screwing with people's actual lives.

2) When the main character (poor son) went down to the basement with the rock, the people who saw the movie with me have been split: half of us think he was going to offer the rock to try and smooth things over since it was supposed to bring luck (while also getting rid of it since it seemed to bring the family mix/bad luck), but the other half of my group are convinced that he was going down to finish them off with the rock to 'take care of the problem' seeing as how he was bringing the rock to hit the drunk earlier in the film.

ffwwtmy,"Definitely a movie where I ended questioning a lot. Mainly, how good was it? Am I stunned into silence, or left wanting a bit more?

..I think it may be the latter..

First: Slightly different take then most commenters here. I thought the parasite was very specifically poverty (and the poverty mindset)

The poverty mindset being the constant seeking of the next plan to make plan to make a quick buck and the living for today + material wealth/pleasures.

Kim even says it when he talks about how the best plan is no plan because you never know what's gonna happen.

Also the rock: said right in the beginning to mean material wealth. At first the boy is attracted to it, then it clings to him until he can't let go of it, and eventually is his demise.

Even if it's not specifically poverty, the movies message was somewhat clear from the beginning. The whole movie seemed to slowly hammer it in minute by minute. So I left feeling, yes I understand, but I also understood from the first part..was it all to make me feel the dread that poverty brings as opposed to just understand it? Maybe. That would certainly be the best interpretation. Otherwise it was a good movie, but the lacking delicacy and depth that would make it a great movie.",dps3xy
fhs0fpi,"This one was a slow burn for me, in a good way.  I saw it several hours ago, and my first gut instinct was that although it was a great movie, beautifully shot, terrifically paced and acted, I didn't get why it was so highly praised and winner of the Best Picture Oscar and other awards.

But then I thought about it... and thought about it... and thought about it...

This is the best kind of movie because it CHALLENGES its audience.  A lesser story would have you cheer for the Kims and against the Parks because of their positions in society.  We all want to see people in poverty do well, and often those who ""have not"" in life want to see families like the Parks fail because of who they are.

But the Parks aren't bad people.  They're a loving family.  They genuinely care about people like Jung-eun and Yoon, even after being manipulated by the Kims, who themselves are not honorable. 
 Ultimately, Mr. Kim realizes that after the flood that forces them into a crowded gym for shelter, but by that point he's lost his soul, his conscience, and ultimately falls on a predatory instinct to attack his host.

Just like a Parasite.

Brilliant movie.",dps3xy
fiez75r,"This movie lived up to the hype and then some. One of the best films I have ever seen, it just kept getting better and better. 

Obviously one’s opinion on the social commentary is heavily skewed on an individual basis, and I’m a quite left-leaning person so I am biased towards it, but I found the movie to be loaded with great discussion fodder. The biggest thing that stood out to me were the depictions of poverty and despair, and just generally being “down-on-your-luck”. If I’m ever finding myself doubting or questioning a far-left perspective or idea, I remind myself that I come from a quite privileged background, at least relatively so, and that I will never have to quite literally wade through shit to save my personal belongings, or survive off of scraps of food, and that I must consider that anytime I’m doubting an idea that intends to stop that from happening. I also found the theme of “low-skilled” (in the eyes of the upper class) workers performing far above their supposed ceiling, really emphasized the fact that we unfortunately do not live in a world where if you are skilled or talented enough, you will have the opportunities you need. And one of the biggest areas of discussion I noticed was in the competition dynamic, namely the Kim family competing with and displacing the other workers. It’s obviously implied that this is a terrible facet of our world and that there should be a better way, but I think that dives into the heart of this big picture debate. Is it ever possible to eliminate competition like that? Certainly over basic necessities, but even in a perfect socialist world for example, could you ever eliminate greed and squabbling among people? Excellent fodder for debate IMO. 

The last thing I found interesting was the murder of Mr. Park by Mr. Kim. Because objectively, Mr. Park did absolutely nothing illegal related to the death of Ki-jung (that we know of). He had no clue the dude was in his bunker, he consciously contributed in no way to her dying. Sure he was being a self-centered POS by demanding they get the car for Da-song rather than Ki-jung, but then again, I don’t think Mr. Kim had any intention of helping Da-song at all. That final scene I think is so brilliant in it’s intersection of morality, big picture debates, etc. Cause I can imagine many would be happy to see the classist Mr. Park die, with supporting logic like all of the lives he’s likely destroyed or worsened in securing and maintaining his wealth, such as those of the previous housekeeper and her husband, and that a just societal transformation will require people like Mr. Park getting out of the picture one way or another. And in there is a good debate about the ends justifying the means, how true that characterization even is regardless of morality, etc. I also think that scene does a great job of showing the natural end of the “fuck you, I got mine”, extreme individualist mindset, complete disregard for the suffering of others and outright vengeance murder. 

Overall, fantastic fucking film, I cannot wait to watch it again and spot even more things.",dps3xy

f6msrjt,"There were several scenes/motifs/shots which I feel like must have had some metaphorical significance, but I struggled to figure out exactly how. Let me know if you have any thoughts on these:

* The scene in the beginning where people are fumigating, and Kim Ki-taek says to leave the windows open. Thinking this might have been meant to mirror how the Parks let the Kims into their house, who drove out the ""pests"" but ""choked"" them? Not sure if that really lines up, though.

* The scene where Kim Ki-jeong is sitting on top of the toilet and smoking as it gushes out sewage. Maybe something about nonchalance in the face of a boiling class uprising?

* The shot shortly after that scene where they're carrying their stuff in a small raft through the flooded scene. Very good looking shot, but I'm not sure if it was supposed to mean anything in particular.

* Kim Ki-woo's relationship with the rock, especially with regards to how he uses it as a weapon and why he leaves it in the river. Not sure at all what to make of this.

* The way the entrance to the basement is lit, how it's an almost pitch-black abyss that people disappear into. Assuming that's something to do with the inescapability of poverty, but I'm not sure if there's more to it.

* The lightning that appeared while Kim Ki-jeong was talking on the couch. My first thought was that this could be an allegory to Frankenstein, showing that the taste of wealth is turning her into a monster. But I'm not sure if that's a reach.

Anyway, for some thoughts of my own. Really well shot and well-acted movie. The house they shot in was incredible, and I really like the shots they got out of it, particularly everything in the living room, and the things they did with light and weather. As for the acting, the movie did a great job of shifting between different tones (horror, comedy, drama, suspense) as others have said, without any of the tones ever feeling forced or misplaced.

This movie had so many genres MIXED into one.

A thriller movie

A Horror movie

A comedy

A Mystery

Etc.

This film had SOOOO many plot twists and it kept me at the edge of my seat until the VERY LAST MINUTE. 10/10 would recommend to ANYONE.
Edit: I’ve been seeing that fantasy was a pipe dream and not reality. But I intercepted that a little differently. I thought it might have been the true reality ending going back to the present and the plan starting, and even with that it was a dark ending, like bittersweet. Even if they did end up living happily ever after(unlikely) it costed them so much. They lost their daughter, we’re separated, and even punished. This alternative interpretation sends a message that even if you are lucky to break into the next social class. It’s not going to be easy at all and most likely you will have to make sacrifices(there’s a cost). And if you take in the other interpretation of the ending, most of the time, you won’t be successful at all.

His father said never to make a plan because it would never work out:
Guess what happened when he had no plan?
Everything got ####### up.

When Ki-woo lands his job as a tutor at the Parks' house, the family celebrates by drinking Flight beer, the cheapest beer in Korea. When Ki-jeong also gets hired by the Parks, the family moves on to drinking Sapporo, a Japanese brand and is one of the best quality beers in Korean supermarkets (about twice as expensive as Flight). However, Chung-sook continues to drink Flight, which may represent a wife/mother's love and willingness to sacrifice for the sake of her family. This is seen later in the film: Chung-Sook commits murder only to avenge her daughter's death, and so she doesn't get sentenced to jail but remains living freely with her son, while her husband snapped and murdered Park for his class-related comments and is currently a fugitive in hiding.",dps3xy

It was definitely an experience, and I think everyone should watch it to draw their own conclusions, like everyone did in the comments here.

To me, it just tells a story. It tells the story of poor people fighting for the opportunity to make some money, while rich people live an easy life. And that’s it. I don’t know, I don’t... see anything else. It’s just a story, a good one, but that’s it. I don’t see this super deep message here.

The main character gets handed a good opportunity by his friend who trusts him and almost immediately betrays that trust... to start dating his teenage student? That's fucked. He works to get his sister hired into a vacant position and she immediately tries to get another working class person fired. Ok he was kinda creepy, we'll pass that. Then the father, who is a personification of everything rich people say is why poor people are poor, gets a job and they all start working on ousting the hardworking and also fairly poor housekeeper from her job for the sake of their mother...
 
At which point the three of them all had pretty well paying jobs and probably had plenty to go on.
 
And what's the first thing they do when the rich people leave town? They decide to all get stupid drunk, fight and break things.
 
I see all these things praising the money about its depiction of Class Discrimination but it's depiction is fucking horrible. Yeah the rich people are judgy but they're fine people paying their workers a fair wage without unreasonable demands and aren't cheating the system. The Kim family on the other hand is happily cheating the system but rather than serving justice or revenge about the people who've perpetuated their terrible system, like the movie initially seems to be shooting for, it just ends up showing how much the Kim's probably deserved their station and were just being the titular parasites.

fhrsmq6,"After scoping this thread out for about 45 min I still don’t fully understand Kevin’s motives with the rock. If we follow the “crossing the line” theme I think this was the first time in the movie someone in the poor family crossed one another. The father told the son the best plan is none and he tried to take matters into his own hands. My theory is that the rock symbolizes the newfound stability of Kevin’s family, Min gifts him it and everything plays into their favour UNTIL he drops it. The mom and the dad play fighting is the lowest they stoop. The poor family was less financially stable but I’d argue they were more stable emotionally until their perfectly orchestrated chemistry is broken. Only qualm I have with this movie is the ghost part should’ve happened before we knew about the basement dweller, the scene is essentially just a guy looking for a snack... Also, I’ll have to watch again but I’m pretty sure 100% of the shots with a Parks family member in it also contain a “parasite”. Even when the parents are talking alone in the kitchen we later know Jessica is eavesdropping. While I’m ranting I’ll also add that Mr Park hinting that his relationship is confusing is just that, I think it’s just a subtle reminder what the movies really about. We aren’t SHOWN but we can guess the Parks family is very shaky. If the movie was ABOUT the Parks we might’ve seen some affairs etc but, in this movie the Parks are merely a pawn for poor people which is a gruelling twist on reality. Even the “loyal” housekeeper from previous house owner mooched in her own way and even Min’s intentions aimed at their money. It’s made EASY to focus on how the Parks view the poor rather than how the Parks are seen as dollar signs and expensive whisky rather than real people. Assuming Mr Parks had to work hard to get himself into wealth, the basement dweller is the only one who realizes this and accepts his low “status”.  Turning the lights on for him like it’s his duty and shouting RESPECT. Slight chance of some back story as to why there’s 3 light switches connected from the basement to upstairs. Truly might be in my top 10. If there’s a book show me to it.",dps3xy

I noticed that when we find out the underground bunker and just the mom is talking to the couple underground.  The father then slips and reveals the rest of the family. I believe the father slipped on purpose. My reasoning is because when the mother is talking to the couple, the (Underground) husband tells her that the 'cake shop went bust' then immediately cuts to only the father listening on, also remember that the father had a cake shop too, that went 'bust'. Then the mother says she is going to call the police, as she is about to do it, the father slips (He did right when the police were gonna get called).

f7fly5p,"thought it was great. Would like to discuss some negatives, since the positives have been covered in so much detail. There were some aspects of the plot that felt really underdeveloped

* Kevin's relationship with Min and Da-hye. He betrays his friend, whom he seems to genuinely respect. It's unclear whether he actually likes Da-hye or is just manipulating her for his benefit. We never see her reaction to discovering the truth, or Min's.

* The dad getting so upset about Mr Park judging his smell, seems very out of place. Lying under the table, he seems so genuinely hurt by these remarks, as if he cares what this aristocrat he's been conning thinks of him. Then he murders Park after he shows disgust at the smell of Geun-sae (Park just wants to save his son who we know has 15 minutes to live, and he doesn't know that Ki-jeong is his daugther)

* Geun-sae's worship of Mr. Park felt kind of strange and unjustified. But I guess he's just gone kooky living in that bunker.

* Kevin's whole character arc. 90% of the movie he's just manipulative and cunning, then he suddenly cares about fitting in, and then decides to murder Geun-sae? Then he has a dream to get rich? There's some theming about the ruthlessness and futility of the rags-to-riches dream, but it felt really muddled

* The whole ending, the dad is in the basement now, but why? Sure, the police are after him, but he could sneak out for a night and visit his family or at least give them a note. I get it symbolically, there's always a poor person suffering beneath the foundations of the rich, but it really doesn't make sense for him to stay there longer than a few weeks maybe.


* Why does Geun-sae stab Ki-jeon? I get that he's in a frenzy, but why her specifically? Maybe I missed something, but it seemed odd that he went directly for her.

* Kevin's brain damage. What was the significance?

* Da-song knows morse code and is shown attempting to decode Geon-sae's messages, but this goes nowhere",dps3xy

Is it a case of “clever” people patting themselves on the back as if to say, “I got that message” when watching this film? A classic case of pretentious critics loving a film, hipsters feeling as if they should love this indie movie too, and then those people who feel as if they have to like it too lest they be labelled a simpleton.

I learned a lot from this thread, too, asking which references us Westerners probably missed: [https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/do3kao/korean\_fans\_of\_parasite\_please\_share\_jokes\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/do3kao/korean_fans_of_parasite_please_share_jokes_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

TL;DR: I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and nearly fell out a couple times, too.  Everything was a surprise and it all *still made sense.*  Masterful storytelling, both in writing and in visuals.

What I thought *during* the movie:

>!\- My goodness, the Kims are in dire straits.  Their daughter seems smart, though, and the son got a lucky break from his schoolmate.  Mrs. Kim's medal didn't appear to garner her a pension, unfortunately.  Mr. Kim started to crack a bit while folding pizza boxes -- slapping them together without a word while his family suffers from the pesticides.  He knows he's supposed to do better.!<

>!\- The Parks' house is friggin' beautiful.  That's how the middle- and upper-class neighborhoods look, too -- all walls up to the edge of sidewalk, separating their properties.  (we're not dealing with Korea's increasingly common high-rise apartment buildings)  No random drunks nearly urinating through your open window.  I thought Mrs. Park was drunk or high, but as others have remarked, maybe she was napping at her table on the lawn simply because she could.  I'm sure I'd do the same thing.!<

>!\- Ki-woo -- is he taking advantage of the girl?  What about his college-age friend -- was he also making out with her?  Pretty awkward for a Western audience, and morally ambiguous enough to show us that this isn't just another movie-scripted poor family.  But is the girl also rebelling against her parents?  I dunno.!<

>!\- Getting ""Jessica"" into the scheme was fun.  Shaping up to be a sort of comedy now.  And then Mr. Kim taking over as the driver?  Although he's a smooth driver, I wonder how long it's actually been since he's driven a car -- he needed to learn the features they have these days.!<

>!\- Getting the old housekeeper fired, and installing Mrs. Kim in her place... uh, yeah... Although the action sequence of framing her as having TB was a funny scene of Korean farce comedy, I felt terrible for her as she trudged away that evening.  What are the Kims doing to this household?  Something ain't right.!<

>!\- ""What would we do if they came home?  Hide like cockroaches?  Ha ha!""  Yeah, ha ha,... Ohhhhhhh dammit....!<

>!\- ""YEOBO!!!""  Holy sh..!!  Up until this point, my wife and I mostly laughed at the jokes and went along for the ride (""mostly"" apart from the housekeeper's firing).  This is when we both gasped out loud.  (this is also the first moment I noticed a music soundtrack)!<

>!\- Geun-se also had a failed cake shop, just like Mr. Kim... except that he's indebted to loan sharks, while Mr. Kim isn't -- making the Kims feel as if they're at least one rung higher than Geun-se and his wife.  Okay, now we've got another class struggle: rich versus poor-but-hardworking versus poor-but-sneaking-while-keeping-a-job (or something like that).!<

>!\- Mr. Park flat-out refuses to say that he loves his wife.  What is she, then?  An accessory so he can fit into upper society?  ""Trophy wife,"" I guess.  What about his kids?!<

>!\- ""Can you just make some ram-don for us?  We'll be home in eight minutes.""  Whoo boy, this is fun, how fast can they clean up their drinks and snacks, lookit her learn ram-don from Youtube, oh damn the housekeeper is almost out of the basement, ha ha slapstick comedy as she back-kicked her down the stairs, ha h... OUCH oh fuck she got fucked up.  Oh fuck.  What now.!<

>!\- Hiding under the coffee table -- like cockroaches! -- and having to listen to Mr. and Mrs. Park talk down about poor people, how he thinks Mr. Kim smells poor, how he doesn't want him to cross a social line and should stay lower-class, how Mrs. Park plays that she uses drugs to engage in risky sex like a poor junkie (tbh, I thought she was a user, and her husband was her supplier... maybe not, as other redditors suggest otherwise)... Everything that the Parks say in this scene is disparaging to Mr. Kim, his family, and any friends they have downtown.!<

>!\- The flood.  THE FLOOD.  And while Mrs. Kim is stuck at the house.  AND while the old housekeeper and her husband are within inches of escaping upstairs and exposing the whole scheme.!<

>!\- Dammit.  They have to go back.  Borrowed clothes, all their stuff is gone except the medal and the scholar's rock.  Mr. Kim is utterly crushed and getting worse, driving Mrs. Park around as she yammers on the phone with her high-society friends about the party and tosses groceries into his cart and ignores him like he's her mule and then she can't hide her disgust about his smell.  Now he knows for sure that these rich people don't give a shit.!<

>!\- Okay, now the birthday party.  Oh God, I think Ki-woo’s dead...  no no no, not Ki-jung....  did Mr. Park really deserve getting killed?  I mean, he's kinda an asshole, but...  The Kims are done, there's no Dr. Strange that'll appear through a time portal and reset everything.  Sonofabitch.!<

>!\- Ki-woo lived?  Really?  And Mr. Kim is in hiding?... Okay, I'll believe that much.  I'd love for Ki-woo to succeed in his plan.  This family has had to deal with a lot of shit.  But... I don't think it'll happen.  Mr. Kim will probably never see the light of day again.  :(!<",dps3xy
fc0ora1,"was left unimpressed by the ending. the film kind of peaked after a very long build up, and then fell flat. 8/10. Again imdb ratings flatter to deceive

ff773bd,"I just don't find the ending sad. The dad doesn't deserve to go as a free man. Even if Park family were ""bad"" people the Kim family treated them the same way even worse.

fh224s3,"Enjoyable, but unless I missed something there was a lot of times I was left wondering ""How?"" or ""Why?"". Like the original maid and driver didn't defend themselves? Surely the driver isn't regularly taking girls around, he'd be able to figure out who did it pretty fast and point fingers. Or a trusted maid of many years wasn't given the chance to prove her innocence and she didn't figure out something fishy was going on? Or after presumably weeks of getting paid probably decent money the family couldn't afford to run to a motel with their work clothes to get cleaned up properly?

fdlan97,"I fail to understand how people can be team kims so easily. They are manipulative, they’re putting (innocent, poor) people out of employment, they’re killing people, they’re stealing from the parks (using their house, etc).
What’s the problem with the Parks? That they’re rich? They respect their employees, they are nice people, they talk about the smell and that’s about it. So what? They Kims are creating an entire plan to cheat this family, they’re so much worse than the parks in terms of attitude and actions.

I was much much more sympathetic to the wealthy family than most people here, I saw a mother and father really care for their children and had upmost sympathy for the rich dad and how he tried to bond with his son. I thought the poor family were shown to be greedy, which was their ultimate downfall. Not only did they get drunk in someone else’s home the poor mum was also closing to calling the police on the incumbent house maid before the tables were turned.

f6324rc,"Just about the only thing I don't think is perfect is the ending.

And I don't mean the actual nuts and bolts of the ending but how long it takes to explain itself. If you're paying attention to the movie, as soon as the son sees the lights flickering from the hill, you know everything.

I just don't get the point of actually having the letters read to us out loud. It doesn't tell us anything we can't have already put together. It hit me as the type of thing that a studio would have stuffed in after reshoots for clarity, but this is not a big studio movie and Bong is not that kind of director.

I have to assume there's something I'm supposed to get out of that final sequence that I couldn't already piece together. Best guess I have is that we were supposed to believe the events described by Ki-woo's letter and interpret the family hug as an ending until the camera pans....but I didn't buy that for a second. You make a whole movie about the ways the world beats down anyone who tries to climb the stairs of class, and then expect me to believe the main character's new plan of ""earn lots of money"" is just...happening?

fb9zre9,"I absolutely loved the movie and just saw it today. However there are a few problems I have, almost all of them are with the ending or climax of the film.

&#x200B;

1)Why did poor dad stab rich dad?

\-I understand that it's supposed to be because of how rich dad was recoiling from the stench of poor people but that feels like a very flimsy reason to stab someone. And this leads into one of my subtextual really big problems with the film.

&#x200B;

2)Why are poor people portrayed so badly?

\-I get that the director is trying to show the different worlds that these people live in. However I felt like the way anyone not rich is portrayed as greedy, unintelligent, unclean, alcoholic. I thought it was interesting because the rich even get drunk in a different manner. With how everyone at the party is drinking wine and playing classical instruments. It's just shocking when you consider that just a few years ago he directed Snowpiercer. And although the poor were portrayed as unclean & uneducated, they had redeeming qualities. In Parasite their only possible redeeming quality was their guile in tricking their employers. I couldn't even get a feeling if the poor family cared for one another or if they were all just income earners to one another.

&#x200B;

3)Why did the son & mom get criminally prosecuted?

\-Their only crime was lying on their job resume essentially right? Maybe that's a severe crime in South Korea. So severe that after going through a public trial, you get probation. I'm sure that made the prosecuting attorney happy (sarcasm). I feel like if this part of the movie were better shot then it would show some sort of contrast between how the rich family are treated by the media as victims of the poor mom & son. But the rich family exits the film as soon as the dad goes into hiding.

&#x200B;

Edit: Fraud has been thrown at them however what was the real fraud? Lying on their resume about having attended a college and possibly changing their names to hide their relation to one another. To actually go through with a trial for someone who lied on their job application, which I don't believe their employers kept a record of since the poor family was paid in cash. There are 2 sources I want to reference.  [A woman lied on her resume to land a $185,000-a-year job. Now she's going to jail](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/australia/australia-woman-jailed-fake-resume-intl-hnk-scli/index.html) This is pretty much the only story I can find about such an incident and it was in Austrailia. [A CareerBuilder survey reports that more than half of employers (75%) have caught a lie on a resume.](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-to-do-when-you-ve-lied-on-your-resume-2063183) It just really stretches my imagination that lying on your resume is a crime that would be punished under the charge of fraud. Even the Australian woman in the article above was not charged with fraud. 

&#x200B;

4)What happened to the love subplot/rich family?

\-The rich girl is literally shown carrying poor son's body after he's been hit in the head. Yet the audience never gets any closure to what happened to the family or how they dealt with the death of their primary earner. I will give somewhat of a pass to the girl though because I think it's highly implied that she's just a horny teenager and would've been making out with anyone who spent time with her ('wouldn't want those rich frat boys slobbering over her'-Min). But it did feel rather jarring how rushed the ending of the film is. Considering how earlier in the film it played in slow motion with crescendo music for picking up a piece of tissue from the trash.

&#x200B;

This is still a very good movie. 9/10 but these things really ding it. However if they weren't in the movie/if they weren't a problem for me/they were properly explained, it would still be a 9/10 for me because I feel there isn't enough meaning in the movie.",dps3xy

But I was very intrigued with this movie, very excited to see it knowing I know nothing about it and I like not being able to read films because it feels like I can read a film within the first act. 

This movie comes to one word only and that's a MASTERPIECE. It was hilarious, thrilling, and unsettling all at the same time. Because this movie up until the Living room scene I was rooting for them and at that point you know knew when the hammer was gonna drop at any moment and this movie you just couldn't figure out when or how. It felt as though every moment was gonna be the moment and that made it special for me. The tone was so fast but slow burning it was making me anxious and I don't feel that way with movies. 

I was upset with the father killing off the boss because at that point he took it as that was the tipping point and to him killing him in anger when your daughter was there who needed you could've been saved, that the consequences were still salvagable. But it got the best of him and after I got over it on the drive home. I understand that without that, without the father doing that, the movie would have JUST been GOOD, it wouldn't have been the lesson and masterpiece it is.

fftek61,"Hmm. 

Well. Hm. 

I’m not even sure how I start so I’ll just jump right into spraying everything I feel and hopefully it ends up somewhat coherent. 

I get the ending is like... the poor pipe dream of “saving” their family by becoming rich and successful. Like, I like that. Kinda. But it feels incomplete.

Like, the movie (or the characters at least) tries to kinda justify their actions by saying “they’re only nice cause they can afford to be nice” but that equally means it’s saying “us, the poor, are only doing bad because we’re poor.” 

But the movie *punishes them severely* for their actions and paints them out to be the bad guys of the movie. They kill the reasonably nice rich people and even kill the...reasonably insane people living underground. 

I know it’s more complicated than this but isn’t it....kinda...saying...poor people are the parasites and they use their socioeconomic trappings to punish the rung above them in a fit of misplaced anger? The underground people kill the poor sister and the poor dad kills the rich father. 

Like, what message is this trying to send? Like I know people are torn over whether the poor dad’s actions were justified but like...how can you justify them when the movie itself doesn’t even justify them? The poor father feels bad about killing the rich father and the poor family is left with nothing but a get-rich-and-that’ll-solve-all-of-our-issues pipe dream which the movie ends kinda implying that it’s abjectly impossible and that that notion is nothing but a pipe dream. Cause at least I read it like it goes back to him just ineptly holding the paper after showing his plan to save his dad. 

I just don’t know. It feels like the movie had a lot of steam going its way all the way into the end of the second act and it’s also *frightfully* well made to the point of absurdity. But the script goes wacky and people kinda stop acting like humans by the time the sun rises after the flood at the beginning of the third act. The son suddenly wants to...kill the underground people? The underground people suddenly turn homicidal? There’s basically no closure on the rich family also.  The kid seeing the Morse code was also an empty plot point too. Nothing came of that right?

I don’t know. It’s a perfect movie from a moviemaking perspective with all the technical categories and the acting and even the directing. But the movie feels like it’s saying the poor are evil parasites even though it clearly wants to make both sides equal in an unfair game.  

I’ve honestly felt similarly about every movie from this director (The Host, Okja, this, Snowpiercer). “Yeah it works really well and isn’t boring.....but the message feels really muddy to someone else besides me right? Right? Anyone?”

I don’t know. This whole write up  was a big string of consciousness right after seeing it. I get that someone will say that “this movie is asking questions and letting the audience discuss the answers” but 1) a movie doing that is kinda lazy and 2) no I don’t think it is doing that. I think it *wants* to do that but I think it’s very accidentally saying the poor family was the bad ones.

edit: more stream of consciousness time! This time it’s about the movie Joker and how I feel the reason some critics (who I disagree with) say Joker is a bad movie applies to Parasite and is why Parasite gives a muddy message. **Some spoilers for Joker follow:**

I don’t know. This movie kinda feels like what people say about Joker. They say *(and again, this is not really my perspective on Joker, just what critics who didn’t like the movie say):* the framing of the filmmaking shows the director’s real intent on what side he is on but it pays lip service to the other side so you can’t accuse it of backing the wrong horse. They say Joker wags its finger at the Arthur for doing bad and it points at mental health and poor vs rich and the extremes someone is pushed to do BUT WHAT ITS REAL POINT IS IS THAT ARTHUR DOES BAD STUFF BUT ITS ONLY *BECAUSE* YOU MADE HIM SO YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL WITH HOW YOU ACT AROUND ME OR YOU’LL GET WHAT YOU DESERVE!!!1! And this filmmaking flaw is either done out of malice or incompetence by the director. 

That’s why some critics say Joker is a bad movie because it tries to prove one point but the rest of the movie contradicts itself in where the plot/camerawork/editing/etc goes. **Now I don’t personally prescribe to that viewpoint on Joker.** I think it’s purposefully a movie meant to drive anarchy in its audience by pushing buttons but I think it ultimately condemns Arthur’s actions and is a good movie. 

But my point is...I think what they say about Joker actually applies to Parasite. It feels like it wants to show socioeconomic class warfare where no one is really the villain but no one is all bad either.......but then it pulls a poor person who’s basically a bloody demon unleashed from hell to punch up exactly one level above them which in turn causes *that* level to punch up to the rich. And who were the catalysts to this whole situation that leads to actual deaths? The poor. 

*”But the movie’s trying to say its the system that’s wrong and it’s the real cause of all our heartache!”* But is it though? I think it *wants* to be about that but is accidentally pointing to another point. 

I don’t know. I feel like a need to watch it again to really know what I feel about it. It’s a very technically well made movie with great performances but its point feels like it was lost somewhere along the way (aka what critics say about Joker so my long Joker soliloquy can be summarized in one sentence). 

Just off the top of my head, I feel like Do the Right Thing is kinda the movie this wishes it could be. That’s a movie that perfectly posits a question that can have two answers and lets the audience figure it out. 

Even the South Korean movie Burning kinda touched on rich vs poor with more grace. That’s a great movie I’m still mentally unpacking way after I saw it and I love it for that. 

I don’t know. I don’t even know what I’m saying anymore and I’m too tired to proofread it. That’s a lie. I just proofread it between writing those two sentences. I think I just have to watch it again. Someday. Probably not soon. I ultimately didn’t care for it after my first time watching it even if it was an almost surgically well made movie up till the third act. Maybe I’m overthinking it and just missed the point.

edit: I did love the hand thing though",dps3xy
ffbeesp,"What I really like about this movie is that it shows how greed can be what causes your demise.

If they had stopped at Mr. Kim getting the job as driver and not kicked out the old housekeeper, they wouldn't have been at the house the night it was raining, they'd never have found out about Guen-sae, their place wouldn't have flooded as they could've closed the windows, Jessica wouldn't be dead and Mr. Kim wouldn't be stuck in the basement.

I thought the film really showed that well - the Kim family could've lived much more comfortably if they had been more grateful and appreciative of their situation.  I am sure the money 3 of them were getting could possibly have been more than enough to get a new place - Jessica even tells Ms. Park that she will have to charge a high rate 4 times a week so from this we can assume that the income they are getting is rather decent. Also when Mr. Park finds the panties in his car, he asks his wife ""I thought you paid him well"" (referring to Mr. Yoon), so we can assume Mr. Kim is also getting a decent salary. 

Even if down the line they were let go they could've saved some money and sent Kevin to University, which in turn would enable him to buy the house and provide a comfortable life just as he wrote in the letter.

This movie really drives home the point that there is no shortcut to success and that greed ~~will~~ can be your downfall.",dps3xy
fhib1hu,"Guys I simply do not understand the hate this place has for the Park family.
How are they ignorant at all?
1. Son faked his college documents to show he is good at English, causing Parks to assume he comes from a stable family.
2. Sister had the perfect act of an art teacher which also shows them being of a higher class.
3. Father is shown to be of a veteran driving profession so that shows them that he is also from a stable financial situation.
4. Mother acts as if she is from a high class service company called the Care, meaning family thought her pay is good and is in a good financial condition.
5. Parks may have said whatever they said about them smelling but they were just talking about it between themselves. They didn't even say harsh words like ""disgusting, I feel like vomiting when he's near me"" they never say anything as bad as that.
6. The father just happened to be there when they said that. 
7. And don't you all act high and mighty and say you have NEVER backbited on other people you sons of bitches, saying bullshit like Parks are ignorant. 
They aren't ignorant, with how skillfully the poor family deceived them, there's no chance of them being suspicious.
8. It's just an unfortunate series of circumstances that the movie portrays where no one is really wrong.
9. Movie shows how the lower class people will fight each other to survive
10. Park family doesn't ruin the reputation of the driver and maid by firing them publicly, but hoping they get a job elsewhere.
11. Park family showed some detest to the smell directly only near the end of the movie, first after the flood when the poor family was in a horrible flood and second when the psycho guy was stabbed and was reeking of blood, is it not natural for a human to cringe at bad stench, you would do the same.
12. Park family being ignorant of the flood is normal, I wonder if any of you are aware of any horrible incidents happening near you and I wonder if you are doing anything to change that, (if u are, then ur just one of the few, most ppl go on with their lives) as did the Parks
13. Again because they thought the teachers, driver and maid come from prestigious background they wouldn't have problems with the flood.

ff8dnlm,"The last time I saw a movie not live up to the hype, like this, was Boyhood. I would even say it's comparable in terms of being a very average movie, with an extremely basic premise but well written and directed.

If I had to describe Parasite it would be a simple: less fortunate family weasels their way into the lives of a rich family as worker bees, only to be interrupted by a basement dwelling homeless man. And it was just about as good as that too.

I understand why Mr. Kim stabbed the father, but the character development between the two, the build up to it in general, just wasn't enough for cold blooded murder. Which segweys into the movies major weakness, pace.

Once you are introduced to the man living under the house, you take a couple blinks and he's stabbing people in the backyard during a birthday party. Prior to introducing the man, the pacing is A-1. 

This would have benefitted being a single season HBO series where the pacing can be controlled, character development has time to ripen, grudges have time to form, relationships have time to blossom, messages are told more organically, and the ending comes from a more dramatic and tense stand point.

I'm going to get flamed for this, and I came to this comment section to see why people enjoyed this movie so much. Some call it the best movie of the entire decade, some say it's the best movie ever made. I would give it a solid 6.5/10.",dps3xy

fhvupt2,"Thing that bothered me about the ending: I find it difficult to justify Mr. Kim's actions when he stabbed Mr. Park. Not his motives but the *rationality* behind his actions. 

Regardless of the struggle between the two classes, or the fact that he was enraged by Mr. Park's selfishness and disgust, to everyone's point, his daughter was bleeding. But Jessica was also still alive (she was shocked when Mr. Kim stabbed Mr. Park). 

It bothered me because it didn't seem like a valid recourse of action for a parent who's losing a child. I get that the characters were not really the most rational in this situation of total mass panic but if he really cared about his daughter to the point he'll murder someone, it would probably be his impulse to take them to the hospital.

Instead, he ***left a dying but still alive Jessica (and Kevin) anyway*** because he had to hide. As a result, Jessica actually died and he couldn't see his family who will be prosecuted. It seems to me he took offense from Mr. Park more than he really cared about his family, which doesn't make sense. He had the freakin keys in his hands. As a distressed parent, he could have acted selfishly and said fuck it, I don't need Mr. Park's permission to use the car my kid is fucking bleeding. But I still attempt to take her to the hospital 10/10 times.

IMO, it would have made more sense if Jessica died instantly so Mr. Kim was acting in revenge for losing everything - his home and his family.",dps3xy
fdchfil,"Just watched the movie and i dont get the hype.

I love movies and watched a lot of them but cant see a clear message from this movie and why it is called so great.

I mean if the message is a criticism to society and the disparity between rich and poor than it does a bad job since the villains are clearly not the rich people. The poor people do all the crimes and destroy several families. 

The only reason park got killed is the father being offended that he smells bad. ( triggered by the last shot when park holds his nose to get the keys)

fg2s8ub,"What a fantastic film. 

To me the villain is poverty or inequality and heroes are very difficult to identify. Every character in the film aside from perhaps the young boy in the rich family commit heinous acts. The deluge seals it: what is a pleasant rainstorm ‘isn’t the sky clear after a nice downpour’ to the Parks is a catastrophe for the Kims. They are probably also getting punished for manipulating the Park family and exploiting Mrs. Parks good nature and naïveté. 

When Mr. Kim stabs Mr. Park I found myself cheering, not because this character or the other is particularly savory/unsavory, rather because in class struggle the bourgeoisie often must be removed from their stations violently. Of course the villain survives because the system is much bigger than two families and one violent act cannot correct anything, rather it leads to the downfall of the Kim family. 

I was also reminded strongly of the Peele film Us. The ‘what lies beneath’ theme of poverty existing in our own basements. I do think the film is making the point that the elite are directly responsible for the suffering of the hoi polloi through their excesses and inactivity. In this way the film can be seen as a socialist/communist manifesto of sorts.",dps3xy

BUT...the way I would have ended it...I would have had the father now living in the basement and the mom and son out in the world. Each side thinking the other side died but not knowing. At the last moment, we see the son have a hunch of where his Dad is...

I say this because, while I liked the fantasy sequence and the reveal of the reality, it felt a little too convenient that the Dad is sending out morse code of this long letter every night in case his son happens to be sitting on a hilltop staring at the house. AND THEN HE DOES!

It is clearly revealed that the basement parasites can hear the footsteps of Mr Park as he ascends the stairs to the main floor of his house from the garage. This is how the man was able to perfectly time the button pressing with the lights turning on above Mr. Park's head with each step he took.

f6o7egv,"(Spoiler) 1 important thing I don't like about this movie:

The Kims fucked up their plan on their own, by celebrating together in the Parks' mansion and ignoring the risk of getting discovered that they were actually a family and frauds.

People will argue that even if they didn't go to mansion altogether, their plan would still fuck up. But at least the plan wouldn't have failed SO FAST if they didn't make this stupid mistake. I guess it's natural for human to succumb to temptation, huh?

The movie has one emotional quote - ""With no plan, nothing can go wrong."", which tries to tell it's hopeless for the poor to plan for the future. But ironically, the Kims practically ruined their plan on their own by committing this first but serious mistake, just to enjoy themselves for a short moment. When the father said the quote, it gave the feeling that he was blaming fate for this. But it's actually their mistake.

If they tried their best, without committing to obviously stupid mistakes, and still failed, then ok, I would buy the plot for this movie.

Nope, they fucked up themselves by relying on luck that the Parks wouldn't return home ""unexpectedly"".

And this fuck-up wasn't even made under pressure.

It's unbelievable that they were capable to trick the Parks and acquire the jobs for the whole family, but then suddenly made this stupid choice to ruin what they had worked so hard for. It's way too obvious to not notice this. It only requires a little common sense to not to risk going to the mansion, and the Kims are at least decently smart, yet the movie decides to have them suddenly go stupid.

And, unfortunately, the second half of the movie (which almost everyone thinks is great, is a climax) is built on top of this stupid mistake. So, 1. this stupid mistake becomes a huge mistake, 2. whatever message this movie is trying to tell (hopeless class struggle, class difference, rich-poor difference), is not told in a convincing way. I'm not saying these messages are not real, but just that they are presented in a non-convincing plot.",dps3xy

fd9wln2,"If the Kim son was affluent like the Parks he would be an even worse drain to society then they were, as evidenced by the persistent greed and lack of sympathy he showed throughout the movie.  He couldn't stop at just a little fraud and use the proceeds toward a constructive vision for upward mobility.

His followup plans after a successful deception was always to increase the level of deception.  His grand vision that never fully materialized consisted of his whole family impersonating qualified professionals employed by the Parks, taking advantage of their underage daughter by hiring actors to facilitate a sham marriage, and eventually owning their luxury home which he will be the sole controller of.  He is not LIKE a parasite who wants to devour and manipulate its host, he IS a parasite that wants to devour and manipulate its host.

Also, the Kim father never instilled any sort of poor nobility in his children they could have used as a foundation to build a better future.  Quite the opposite.  In the end he murders Park, the host, after the deception fails and becomes parasite to a new unsuspecting family.  One feels his children, learning from him, thought their only solution to poverty was a get rich quick scheme destined to fail or resign themselves to no plan and no hope at all.

As much as one wants to root for the Kim's success, they are too loathsome for that.  As much as one wants to despise the Park's, they are generally decent and principled people.  One would have to hate them for simply having wealth, in and of itself, while the Kim family shows all sorts of character flaws that can't all be attributed to merely being poor",dps3xy

I thought overall it was an interesting movie and liked some aspects of it, but there were just too many plot holes for me to be able to enjoy any of it.  Wouldn’t the family have been the least bit concerned that the rich family would return from camping in the rain?  How were they suddenly experts in each of their fields when they took over jobs from the staff?  By visiting one Mercedes dealership suddenly he’s an expert driver?  What happened to the friend that gave the son the job initially, he never comes back from abroad.  They were making tons of money from the family and even negotiated good salaries but we never saw them reap the rewards of that.  Ridiculous tired tropes of figuring things out on the subway line by line, family hiding under a table.  The father sends out that entire letter by Morse code every night on the off chance that his son sees it, and does?! That letter was extremely long.

When the maid came back she was begging them to just help her husband and the con family threatened to call the cops on her. Why should we have any sympathy for them?

fhdf7aq,"First of all i loved 'parasite' and it is no wonder a great movie. But there are still little things that bugged me. But the movie is still perfect with it. 

1) Now, the smell thingy... I don't think Mr. Park did anything wrong there. He never complained about it to him. He could have easily insulted him. What he said was between him and his wife, which he eavesdropped in the first place which is very wrong. And I don't think it is wrong to be discomforted if something smells bad. Atleast he didn't point out. He was well mannered. So killing Mr. Park was a really bad decision. 

2) About the love story of the rich daughter and the poor son; firstly, Min(friend) clearly told him that he likes her and plans to marry her. The poor son should not have made advances with her. Also, they both were interested since their first class. Which is weird for both of them. He was clearly betraying his friend and I don't think she was any serious about it as probably Min and her had a similar relationship. Also, didn't the poor son think about what will he do if Min comes back. He'll obviously be pissed and may even reveal their whole family's plan to the Park's

3) They showed us that the rich son was able to crack the morse code HOLP ME, they didn't show anything about it later. 

4) The old housekeeper's husband said that he was living there for 4years (if I'm not wrong), the rich family clearly pays their employees a lot. So weren't 4 years enough to pay for the loan sharks? (There weren't any extra expenses of light and water as she lived with the rich family) 

5) Someone else in these comments mentioned that the rich daughter was ignored by the family and I totally agree. They only seemed to love their son. 

6) About the flickering light, defective objects in a rich house clearly don't look good. Didn't they think of calling an electrician? Then they would have easily found out about the switch controlling it, eventually exposing the secret room

fh6au0x,"Just seen this and enjoyed it, but it certainly didn't live up to the hype. Bong described it as a “comedy without clowns, tragedy without villains”, but the Kims seem to engage in a fair bit of both clowning and villainy along the way. I can handle feeling ambivalence towards protagonists, but in the end, too many of the characters acted in ways that either made little sense or simply didn't remotely serve their interests.

For example, the reasoning for having Gook Moon-gwang's husband camped in the basement seemed pretty weak in the first instance, but ok. It was the actions of the Kims in act three that really took me out of it and killed any empathy for them. Chung-sook and Kim Ki-jeong seemed to have their heads screwed on with regard to dealing with the problem, but Ki-taek's 'no plan' and Ki-woo's 'stove their heads in' idea seemed bonkers and at odds with the street smart image of the characters that was presented previously. Da-song decoding the husbands message looked like it was going somewhere, but was dropped completely, which also bothered me.

The single biggest thing though, was that Kim Ki-taek stabbed Mr Park. As his daughter lay bleeding out, he was more affected by a perceived slight about how he smelled, than his mortally wounded child? Even if it was the last straw of resentment I didn't buy it and from then on, couldn't shake the 'what the fuckery'.

I don't think I would watch it again. But I might read some film critics' reviews to see what in-jokes and symbols I missed.

Lets flood the Kims home to dial up the audience's pity for the plight of the working class, and contrast it with the birthday to show how these rich people live in their elitist bubble###. Not edgy at all...

Also, the relationship between Ki-woo and the teenage girl felt so superficial. He grabbed her wrist and now she's into him? That cat-and-mouse scene where the poor family was hiding right under the noses of the rich family is such an over-done joke in my opinion. While it can be applied tastefully this is not the case here at all.

fdcgqbk,"I really liked the movie! The first and second acts were so enthralling and filled with excellent pacing and character. But, the third seemed to just slip for me.

Everything that seemed to happen the morning after the flood just felt very off in my honest opinion. I honestly thought it was going to end with all of the family members dying at the hands of Guen-se and I was priming myself for that bitter ending. But, then only Ki-jung dies, which made it even more bitter, but does anyone else think it felt pointless to kill her off? Only one main character? I don't know, seemed really odd to me.

I think the movie is very cleverly made with it's visuals and the meanings behind them, as well as the foreshadowing. But, I think that ending just shocked me a little. I was expecting the Kim family to kill the Park family and steal their identity, then when the old maid came and we dove into the lower basement, I was expecting the Park family to have slaves locked downstairs, then I was expecting the Kim family to all die as essentially John and Jane Does because of all the fake identities and no one would know who they really were. So, to get an ending where only one who suddenly dies, the other two go back to living in poverty and the other living in the hidden basement doomed to the same fate as Guen-se?

A little surprising to say the least.

The first and second act felt very surreal in their own way and then suddenly the third act became very realistic all of the sudden, like someone just snapped us out of a dream. I guess I just wasn't expecting to have a very somber and realistic ending when the rest of the movie was very 'movie realistic' if that makes sense?

The fact that we don't get to actually see the Park family reactions to being conned the whole time was a majorly missed opportunity, I wanted to see the Park mother's reaction especially since she was in the movie for so many scenes, to suddenly disappear after fainting and we see no long-term consequences to the Kim family's actions is a little disappointing.

ff2qwpl,"The movie is masterful and there’s no denying that. It’s truly a thrilling spectacular ride. Only a master filmmaker can intertwine a popcorn thriller with highly complex social commentary in such a successful and seemingly effortless way. The directing is clearly incredible. The movie deserves to be in the academy awards and nominated as best picture, Director and screenplay. 

Something that needs to be said is that the movie comes off like a film written by a pessimist who has compassion for the poor but hasn’t any real experience and therefore true understanding of them. The history of judgment of moral behavior in relation to perceptions of class is highly complex and usually utilized to pressure apathetic thinking towards structural change. Parasite doesn’t seek to say anything, yet chosing to say nothing suggests a sort of status quo and therefore seemingly unknowingly plays into that history. It draws conclusions that are “balanced” only from the perspective of someone who is inexperienced in poverty and therefore unknowing of the real depths at play. 

The writer knows the stories told about who the poor are and their experiences and has great compassion for them. While able to use these things to make a likeness that can be validating to see, it is still like an artist that has never seen a Rhino who makes a drawing of a rhino based on descriptions and stories told about them. For those with real life experience with poverty and classism the way the dark comedy depicts its poor characters and utilizes it’s irony will give a feeling that this is a hollow depiction, while not noticeable at all to those who have never seen a rhino themselves. For most it will be enjoyable and thought provoking, while for those who have experienced poverty it will be simultaneously validating and alienating. This isn’t to say anything negative about the film, only that the masterful work is so powerful the majority of the audience is prone to forget fiction only reflects the creators interpretation of reality and isn’t reality itself. The complexities of class in relation to moral behavior is complex, and parasite is sure to enthrall and be enjoyed many. With a forced smile and a clever wit the film gives a sorrowful nod to the status quo of class inequality.",dps3xy

When I first watched it, I thought he was planning on murder since he looked very anxious leading up to the confrontation, hence dropping the stone. However, this explanation doesn't feel satisfactory because 

1. A stone wouldn't be a great tool to kill people with

The daughter has amazing skills at Photoshop, chooses to lie, cheat and steal. The son who obviously has skills to teach English on some level, chooses to also lie and cheat. The dad seems smart and can also make a good living, but again, laziness. I mean your family can't even put together pizza boxes the right way. The irony of it is, they make a fake business THAT COULD HAVE BEEN A REAL ONE.... lol They most likely could have made bank with that business idea, but they are too shortsighted and lazy to see it.

Mr. Park is the only one with out blame in the whole movie, you are where you are because of the choices you made in life, everyone in the movie made their choices, Mr. Park has money and is a baller because he put in the work to get what he wanted, everyone else is just a parasite living off of him.

f5zzvr7,"THiS MOVIE! Man! Let me tell y'all something! Let me tell y'all something!

Man! Let me tell y'all something!

Parasite (2019) is an absolute masterpiece of theater that is a must see. Bong Joon Ho might have found his magnum opus in this film. Let me tell y'all something!

The story is a stew seasoned with many genres. You got your drama, the comedy, some horror, and a thriller boiled into a delicious meal and served with a healthy dose of good cinematography, themes, and captivating acting. On top of this stew is a good drop of awesome directing. 

Parasite is about a small family of four, the Kims, who are so impoverished that these guys have to climb up to reach their toilet. Preach Bong Ho! I mean this family is so poor that they have to poach wifi from the nearest cafe. I see we're in church now. They are so poor that when the street exterminator passes by, they leave their windows open in hopes that their bug problems are eradicated too. Bong is too real. Everything changes when the oldest son, Kim Ki-woo is recruited by his best friend (*nepotism never fails*) to be a substitute English tutor to the daughter of a wealthy magnate. Upon ending his first lesson, Ki-woo encourages the matriarch of the wealthy Park family, excellently portrayed by Jang Hye-jin, to hire his sister. From that point on, the Kims utilize every opportunity to take advantage of the wealthy Parks. The story is for anyone who understands wealth disparity and the pains of failing to better ones life. 

Bong does not adhere to one specific genre in Parasite. There are times when the film feels like a heist film and there are times when the movie feels like Get Out and Us. One could also see similar themes to current films like Joker and The Lighthouse. The director also makes use of the environment in each scene to tell his story. Small tight shots in the Kims' home would make the viewer feel claustrophobic. Contrast that with the open wide shots at the Park's mini-mansion, one could literally feel the difference in the wealth disparity. 

Overall, Parasite is an amazing film that covers the affects of wealth disparity between the poor and the rich. The movie is filled with great acting, amazing dialog, and a message about empathy. Boon has done an Oscar-worthy job with this film, and it would be a disgrace if he's not nominated for Best Director. Parasite is one of the best, if not the best film, of 2019. See this film every chance you get!

**Notes**

- You have to be a really good friend for someone to trust you to look after his/her crush
- That ghost scene had me in tears from laughing
- How much wealth must one possess in order to afford to be naive?
- That final night was brutal
- There is no way Ki-woo survived that ending, which leads to...
- Parasite's epilogue was imagined by the father, Kim Ki-taek

this is suppose to be a commentary on inequaity in korean society, but when you really analyze the kim family, no wonder they are such bums, they deserve it too.

f72jmlo,"I should preface this by saying this was probably my favorite movie of the year and I was as amazed by it as everyone else in this thread.

However, I was kind of underwhelmed by the social commentary aspect of the movie. I went in having read that it dealt a lot with class struggle, so I kinda expected the sort of social commentary we got from Sorry to Bother You. But there was barely any of that here. 

Sure, the Parks are pretty classist, and we're shown how ridiculously better their life is than that of the protagonist family. But we're not shown the Parks exploiting the labor of the poor people. Nor do we see how the poor people's lives are the result of the Parks accumulated wealth. Quite the opposite, actually. The Parks are framed as providers in the movie, giving jobs to every member of a family of four. They even say something along the lines of ""if we combine our salaries, the amount of money we're receiving from the Parks is crazy!""",dps3xy
fhhjj0u,"This may be a stretch, but I can't help but give credit to the colonialism allegory within this film. Upon first viewing, I thought it was all about social class. After my second viewing, I think it says so much more about the symbiotic relationship we currently have with the Earth (and maybe life itself), specifically in contrast to the less parasitic relationship that indigenous societies like the Native Americans had.

The allegory becomes quite blatant by Da-Song's obsession with native Americans and a sort of Native American battle playing out at the end (the scene of which was so elequently imagined by his mother in strangely specific detail hours before). Ki-woo also repeatedly says ""it's metaphorical"" throughout the film, so I certainly feel inclined to take the plunge.

Let's lay out the basics: the Park household is not theirs originally. It was previously the home of its own architect. Architect...kind of sounds like God right? Well we can certainly assume so since it's so metaphorical. The house and it's property are the Americas, or at least a utopian, or maybe raw, form of it. The Park family now inhabits it, and were given a trusty maid who was left behind by the architect/previous owner. Now, an important distinction to make is that, if we are to go the colonization route, the Parks are not the Native Americans: Moon-Gwang and the other caretaker's are. After all, they would be caring for the Earth. The Parks represent the culture itself, each one of them (the symbolism of a functioning family and household). We have the father (science/innovation/production), the daughter (romanticism), the son (creativeness), and the mother (ritual/ettiquette/tradition). I find the mother to be the most difficult to identify, but I believe she is really the heart of the family. She is constantly active, and is leading the direction of things even if she herself lacks some rationale and skepticism.

In comes the parasite - our colonizing family, coming from what seems to be a much louder and more populated place. We can assume them to be the Europeans. We see them slowly make their historical infestation, slowly and surely knocking out the previous caretaker's of the land. We even see a reference to the small pox epidemic that contributed mostly to the success of the European's colonization of America. With it coming in the form of peaches, we even get the sense of the family planting it's flag, as peaches were brought over with the Spanish when they first discovered the Americas (originating in Asia, actually). Though, let's not forget that until the climax of the film, at least one of the original inhabitants remains in the house.

Geun-se, our little basement hermit, is comfortable where he is for a reason. Geun-se is our instinct - the side of ourselves married to the provider/caretaker that keeps us surviving. This is our instinct that feels a need for God, that needs motherly love, that chomps down on a banana, or that jumps willingly into battle. It's an instinct that we are aware of, and we eat for two because of it. We keep it locked away because it usually results in punishment (debt-owed), but when society isn't watching we bring it out to dance with and celebrate the creation.

The colonials are a bit different. They're there all at once, in the wide-open, slipped into this society by genuine trust. When society leaves them to their own accord they get drunk, skirmish, and make a mess of the place. It's because they're parasites and they truly just want to suck the marrow from the Earth until they are full. Not to mention they feel entitled to it (of course).

Then we see history unfold. The original inhabitants find out the truth and they fight back. They of course lose. That fighting spirit is still lingering though, and the colonials have to put an end to that (Geun-se) as well as the culture itself (Mr. Park). This mass genocide and erase of culture is something that we in America to this day still struggle with. It's been put to the sideline, just like our instinct, because we can't erase history. It's where we came from: similar to our own evolution. Except we don't take care of that burden, but instead it has to let itself out to maintain it's reality (""Happy Indigenous People's Day""). The land lacks much of its original culture, it's liveliness. We know it's not the same. We lack a connection to our instinct that helps us celebrate God's creation. To us now, God is dead, and there is only shame in the basement of our human history. All we can do is dream that we can one day come to terms with it.",dps3xy

ffq2roq,"As a teenager, I have been infatuated with cinematography and films since I was young. My father, who was practically an amateur critic, would showcase and present me his favorite feature films that he had progressed and expanded in his life of several decades. He rates movies and declares on watching them in a conceited method. Using movie ratings, any movie that seems to have approached over 80% on Rotten Tomatoes, he would give it a watch. Any movie over 90%, he would definitely watch. Any movie under any of those ratings, he believes it as waste of time. With this unhealthy mentality being exposed to me ever since I was a kid, my criticism for films has come to become overwhelmingly harsh. My ratings for films would be far lower than the average viewer that I conversed/interacted/viewed. I would dock points and be disappointed for a film if I had noticed a flaw of any kind, small or big. For almost 18 years, I have watched films. And I have begun to think that I had the special mind of a “critic” where it was far more challenging to impress me in any aspect compared to the average viewer. Sure, this mentality may cause many people to think that I was simply a picky, foolish teenager that was far too cocky with their tastes. I have recognized this. But it was reasonable to a certain extent. I tend to think about films as they progress and surprisingly, 100% of all films I have watched, I would always be left slightly or far disappointed because I was able to predict/expect how the film was to reach its peak or how it was to end. A clear example is the film *Knives Out*. A mystery film released in late 2019, it has received spectacular reviews. Many say that it was one of the best films they have watched in their life. I had the chance to watch it the past week with high expectations. My experience was a complete contrast to that of the reviews. Unfortunately, I was practically able to depict how the film was going to resolve, who the “perpetrator” was, and so on much before its climax. Maybe if I had watched the film without analyzing every shot, I would have enjoyed the film. But this is who I am. I do this and that is how I watch films. Of course, the film industry has evolved into a market that is pervaded with halfwitted big-budget CGI films for viewers with quite simple mindsets of having an effortless fun experience at the movies with friends or family, which I cannot stress, is perfectly fine. But for viewers such as me, who love to analyze films and watch them like it if it was a form of art, the modern generation of filmography has become far bland, with most being - ahem\* excuse me - shit. From big-budget, low effort Chinese funded films to “popular” trendy “superhero” films, the market has evolved into something that was not a delightful experience for me. This directly connects to my initial mentality. I have watched many many classics ranging from a multitude of genres. With a father with a strict process of watching and rating films, I have fetched a similar mentality, possibly far more stern and harsh than one of my father’s. But because our generation of films has degraded in quality, in the artistic aspect anyway, it is rare for me to have given a film that is over a 9/10 on my rating scale. In fact, I have practically accepted that a movie that was so perfect to have received a 10/10 on “my” scale would be virtually infeasible. In the hundreds of reviews I have written for films, there was some sort of negative nitpicking that had left me unsatisfied “perfectly”. This, as a result, has left me to accept that I could never be fully 100% satisfied with any film in the upcoming future or in the near past.

But today, everything has changed. A few hours ago, I was able to receive the opportunity to watch the film *Parasite* directed and written by Bong Joon-Ho. I have watched many of Bong’s films from the classic *The Host* \- which I can confidently recommend to many people - to *Okja*, his most recent film, linked and partnered with Netflix. After watching *Okja*, I was left immensely disappointed and I am quite guilty to say that I had lost all respect for Bong’s spectacular storytelling and cinematography. But after watching *Parasite* today, I could accept that is by the far the best film I have watched in my life and I have gained this newfound respect, far massive than something I had before.

I went inside the theaters with exceedingly high expectations and as it began, I formed many scenarios of how it was to resolve and thinking of how I could match this film to a genre. Not once in my life, even after watching hundreds of classics that so-called “revolutionized” the film industry, have I became so immersed with the film to have been left disappointed that the film had ended. It was almost as if I was able to finally “feel” the great emotion of being amazed by a film, so much that it would leave me with “no words”. As the film caught on, I completely forgot about my habit of “analyzing” due to the immense immersion I was in and for the first time, I was able to have the reaction to that of the average viewer. I believe that the *Parasite* is far superior to any classic film that people believe that revolutionized Hollywood. Many resort to saying that Hitchcock was the ultimate film director, completely revolutionizing cinematography using his new-wide skills of contemporary film shots and robust scenarios. But what Bong did was something much more than that. In a generation where everything has been discovered and finding a new creative method to film something is unrealistic, that is what Bong has done with *Parasite*. What Bong did was that rather than creating a simple “good” film with fine acting and fine screenplay writing and fine cinematography, he has invented a new genre of films. He has truly revolutionized the modern film industry, something that I believed was simply irrational to even consider. *Parasite* has defeated me. I could not predict it not once. I could not even consider how it was to go on. The only question I had the entire film was *“Okay, what the hell is next? Where is this going? How the fuck can you even end this?”*. But in fact, he did end it. And it was not a disappointing one. It left me with an open mouth. No words. I would sit through the entire credits without saying or moving. I was just thinking to myself “*Holy fucking shit.*”. On the drive home, I was thinking “*Holy fucking shit.*”. For many hours at home after, I was thinking “*Holy fucking shit.*”.

I did have one disappointing thought about the film. And it was not about the film at all. As a Korean-American, who is very very familiar with Korean culture and being able to fluently speak it as well, I was able to watch it with ease without translations. *Parasite* is a Korean film. And because it was a Korean film, it was a film derived from Korean culture. As I watched the film, I could only be left disappointed that for some scenarios, the translations strayed away from its original meaning. But I cannot complain, some parts of Korean culture and language are just not possible to translate on paper perfectly for American viewers. That is my disappointment. I am sad that American viewers, who do not understand the Korean language or culture, cannot spectate the film as I have, who fully understood the hints that only one of a Korean viewer could catch. (As a side note for American viewers who were unfamiliar with Korean language or culture and you happen to learn or become familiar with Korean culture or language, I highly recommend that you watch it once more, it just makes the film so much better and polished.)

Regarding the film, I could write pages and pages about my internal thoughts about the film. In fact, I am confident that I could write an entire book regards to my reaction and thoughts about the film. But it is pointless. When you attempt to explain this film to another, you cannot. The only way to know is to have watched it yourself. I cannot review this film. I cannot explain this film simply as a viewer. I cannot talk about how “good” the plot was or how “good” the screenplay was. It was none of those things. It was just….how would I say it…..a film made by Bong and only Bong. My final thought? The only thing I can say is to fucking watch it.

**Rating: 10/10**

**Note:** I have noticed that it has been nominated for Oscar’s best picture as well. I have watched every nominee film (except for *Little Women* which I will hopefully be able to watch before the Oscar’s). Any other film, in comparison to the *Parasite* is complete child’s play. It is like comparing a film made by a high school freshman to that of a professional. While I am aware that the chances of a foreign film winning an Oscar Best Picture are very slim, I hope it holds out as I believe that the traction it may cause may once again inspire the film market to create new contemporary films so that I can once again, possibly rate another film a  10/10 in the future. *Parasite* has given me hope that film can evolve once more. Thank you Bong.",dps3xy
fehrtrv,"Okay thought it was great...it’s a Boon Joon Ho film though so that’s expected. The commentary just didn’t strike me as much as everyone else though. My younger life wasn’t that much different from the kims and now I’m writing this on a 1000 dollar phone, so maybe I’m kind of like “whatever so what” to the juxtaposition and comparisons of the three families. Idk, as a movie it was amazing. The directing as amazing as expected and the visuals and writing were sharp. 

It just didn’t strike me as a , “oh my god best movie in ages” type of film though. I expected it to be amazing Coming from Boon Joon Ho, I just didn’t feel anything towards the actual commentary. Idk, maybe I need to watch it again.",dps3xy

felvf6e,"I finally got around to seeing Parasite and really enjoyed it. However I think it's overrated online but that's understandable if people who aren't into cinema are comparing it to some of the dross that has also been nominated this year. In truth though it just falls short of something special.

Still a great movie and an 8/10 on my scale. I rated Memories of Murder higher although I haven't seen it in a good 5 years but that's 2 great films from this director so a few more of his films will be going on the watchlist.",dps3xy

fjqpyhb,Everyone keeps hitting on Mr. Park being an asshole to Mr. Kim but Kim kept asking Park if he loved his wife. I think it obviously made Park uncomfortable. Even when he was messing with his wife he asked her to wear the panties he found.,dps3xy
fj5eg9g,"I understand the accolades for this film, but some of the key scenes aren't properly given their due.

For example, the father stabbing Mr Park. All because he was offended by his smell. I could understand if it was something much greater in magnitude on a personal level...but his smell? This would have been fine for me, however it was clearly referenced in the middle that Mr Kim is a jokester. For instance when he pretended to act violent toward his wife for calling him a cockroach. It was staged in a way to be shocking behavior for the son and daughter, not as a lesson of his unhinged personality. Given he was the first one laughing at the situation he put himself into, that is fairly evident. Poorly done foreshadowing event because it foreshadowed the polar opposite reaction we were expecting Kim to have, based on his previous ""outbursts""

Another example, the son goes down into the basement to find the two parasites. From his point of view, he still thinks there are two of them tied up. From our point of view, we think Kevin is going to kill them with the rock. The rock that he keeps bringing up as a metaphorical outlet to his current problems. First off, there wasn't any way for Kevin to know how to access the basement because he was never privy to the mechanics of its door. Second, his dreamlike passive behavior over the Parks having a party the day after Kevin's house and belongings were flooded does not match up with Kevin's precise tendencies to think things through. Doesn't mean he has to have a plan for everything, but he is a smart person. So it does not stand to reason that there is enough going on with Kevin's life to just go that far off script after dealing with a family fallout I am sure he has gotten used to in the past.

Also, Kevin should not be alive. He was pelted with that rock....twice. Not sure why Bong felt it was meaningful to keep him alive, given he was mentally disabled afterward.",dps3xy
fhzxcke,"RESPECT!

Loved it, only critique is that the ending could've been more powerful, i just found it rushed or odd that he made it that far in life so quickly. Characters look like they didn't age much, his Dad looked like he was only in there for a day. Just didn't seem like he sacrificed much to finally afford that house and get his dad free. I think they could've illustrated the loss of time much better, thus resulting in a much more satisfying ending. Nonetheless it was good.",dps3xy

My favourite seen was when the son was upstairs talking with the girl about how everything he was seeing was so picturesque and unreal, as if the wide window was almost a screen of sorts, and how he wouldn't have fit into what he was seeing because of social class divisions. Despite this, he, and most of us, are programmed to want to attain the level of wealth that he's (and we're) seeing through various forms of media and societal expectations and, funnily enough, through the film itself. The film ironically incentivises wealth and its associated lifestyle despite its message.",dps3xy

First off, beautifully done. Boon Joon Ho has done it once again. Conquering the international campaign of cinema. Respect to his hard work, gifted cast, and an incredible story. Now I see why he deserves the awards. 

Alrighty then, What was the movie about? As I was watching it my eyes peeled wide open and on the edge of my seat about every scene that occurs. I wrote down some themes/morals that could in fact apply to this movie. 
Here is a list of possible themes/morals what I thought were present:

Introduction to the Dark Triad,
True nature of acting/human behavior,
A demonstration of deceit and manipulation,
Balance/battle between morality and ethics,
A demonstration of vulnerability,
Concept of Trust/relationships,
The modern definition of societal enslavement,
Vicious nature of survival of the fittest,
Ideas of reference,
Power of greed,
The irony of gifts,
""Den of Thieves"" concept,
Self-acceptance/Self-worth/Self-actualization,
The life cycle of a ""parasite"",
Coming of age of today's society of success,
The importance of family,
The analysis of hierarchy and the detriments of both sides (poor and rich), 

If you would like to know more about how I came to these, PM me.

Not saying this is a bad movie by any terms though. The director delivered what he set out to do with this and he did it effortlessly but Memories Of Murder was a tad better in my eyes.",dps3xy

fhrqg8p,"I had another random thought: Was Ki-Woo considered the least valuable family member to the Parks?   


I was thinking about the party scene; Ki-Taek and Chung Sook as driver and housekeeper both have important roles in the household. Ki-Jung(as mentioned in other threads) managed to cross the line to become friendly with Mrs. Park, in addition to having the important role of being Da-song's ""art therapist"". Da-song himself seems to be the child with more attention devoted to him.  


In contrast, Ki-Woo mainly has his relationship with Da-Hye tying him to the family. He only really ends up going to the final party because Da-Hye suggests inviting him. Whereas the other family members each seem to have secured their place.   


And although Ki-Woo initially seemed to impress Mrs. Park, it's been mentioned by commenters that Mrs. Park doesn't really respect Ki-Woo as much as Min and pays him less.  
I suppose Ki-Taek and Ki-Woo are shown to have the most insecurities in the film.",dps3xy

fhgjc3z,"Very poignant message that resonates today in the hash political climate where you see the two different poor classes fighting and cheating each other out of a job or being against each other when it really was the rich man who looks down on them and causes them so much shame and resentment but some cases of the poor person practically worshipping the rich man because he has what he has probably from the same methods that landed the first family down in the basement. While the rich look down on the poor as smelly and ungrateful for what they have and the poor man having his uprising.

Honestly this feels more of the ""dangerous film"" vibes that a lot of news outlets were saying about Joker. But it is so fitting of the times of course it should have won best picture.

That said I don't think it's the best film of the year or even the best film by Bong Joon Ho. But it's an important film. If anyone was ever asking what was the late 2010s like this would be a good film to show them. I think what would have made it a better film was maybe structuring and editing. Maybe have it like a pulp fiction style with the ending still remaining the ending but broken up into chapters of each character and their position in the story.

Was a great ensemble cast and I feel they could have used more of it and the linear narative kind of takes it away. But 8/10, great film, important film, just probably not my favorite.",dps3xy

I didn't fall for the hype. The acting and visuals would be close to 9/10. They definitely made the movie. However the application of the story let it down. A lot of decisions made by the characters were just not believable. For example it is believable, very rare but has happened, that someone could hide in a secret area. But definitely not believable if they use morse code through a light every night and not get found out. Feeling downtrodden because of the way others treat or think of you is definitely believable. But stabbing someone because of this does not translate to the real world. How many people in the real world are treating a lot worse and don't stab people.

ffpzpi5,"Its clear that the Parasite referred by the movie is the Kim family.   


Many of you will disagree because it may feel uncomfortable. But its an inconvenient truth that the Kim family were parasite. 

The movie explicitly shows how poor opportunist people cling on to the rich and slowly spread as parasite; taking advantages and eating their wealth bits by bits, how desperate they become if the host (Park family in this case) is infected by some other parasite and how it ends as a struggle for survival ultimately killing the host. 

The movie is a black comedy and one need not get disheartened to realise that the likable protagonists are actually referred parasite and they are in fact the antagonists. 

People posting comments that Moon gwang's husband is the parasite or Mr. Park is parasite etc. need to get their thoughts straight. The movie tells a story about Kim family and how as parasite they infected the park family and overcame an existing parasite (Moon gwang family) which was already living inside that host.",dps3xy
fh7ik3p,"It was far from deserving best picture; worth only for Best Foreign Film. Infact, 'Life is Beautiful' was much more deserving foreign film to win best picture & which sadly got defeated by 'Shakespeare in Love'.   
   
 It had good cinematography, direction, acting and very good production design. But the film didn't have any level of greatness or any extra-ordinary aspect, rather it was a one-time watch mix of contemporary story lines.   
   
 Its laughable to see some people hailing it as a great movie going 'Whoa!....its a movie about class difference...OMG....rich and poor stuff.....Wow!' as if movies about rich & poor were never made.   
   
 The first half is a typical con-men movie about a con-family invading (infecting a host as Parasite, subtle symbolism check) a rich family. Influences from Dirty Rotten Scoundrels & The Heartbreakers are evident.   
   
 The sudden twist of a new character hiding in basement/bunker is a straight away influence from the Spanish movie 'The Hidden Face' & the Hollywood movie 'Don't Breathe'.   
   
 Second half is a self-indulgent psychological horror where it falls into character inconsistencies. A group of smart people capable to think & scheme a contrived plan to employ themselves in a rich family gets suddenly emotional and takes poor decisions. Suddenly falling in love with a rock, entering the basement of enemies all alone, asking a personal question once again after being warned once etc.   
   
 Infact a smart person like Kim Ki Taek who knows how to plan, lie & motivate people is a type of person who have seen the world and also knows his boundary in master-servant relationship. This person should have easily understood that Park doesn't like to chat personal stuffs and now if he wants to continue to reap the benefits, he has to stay mum & maintain decorum. But no, he farts again!   
   
 I mean, he should even know that a simple deodorant could have solved his odour problem. Had his character been the weakest of Kim family i.e. timid, emotional & not smart enough like rest of the members, his actions would have made sense.   
   
 The sheer hatred, antagonism, animosity to kill Mr. Park wasn't established or rather justified. The movie ended up as a self-indulgent drama. I know some simpletons here will grasp at straws to find relevance & symbolisms by saying 'I didn't see any problem to relate the end....it happens to poor people....blahblahblah' But the fact is that the script was a bit poor which brings the point that even the 'Best Screenplay' was undeserving.

fhan3ey,"First  of all I kinda liked the movie.(not a hater) I expected more but that's  on me. It's definitely shot well with some beautiful cinematography,  good actors etc. But I just HAVE to say it (spoilers ahead)- It didn't  make much sense to me, not logically, not thematically. Even when they  ALL got jobs, that's 2 full-time working adults, 2 part-time working(and  sister haggled a good pay as far as I can understand) they still  couldn't afford to move out of their home? Like what? How bad is the pay  in South Korea? How little do this rich people payed them? What's the  point of this whole scam if you get paid like sh\*t anyways? They could  moved out(just rent if they don't have time to move, it's easy now) in a  smaller(2-3 bedroom appt, yes it's cramped for 4 people but sorry not  the end of the world, maybe further from the city or something if it's  that expensive). Yeah it sucks but you can do something. Why keep living  in your crappy house especially if you got call out on it(smell) and  your whole scheme can go bust. They aren't even good con artist. Like  they couldn't think of that themselves (?). Not having a plan is really  working out for them huh?(sarcasm)

And  just a personal note as a squeamish guy I don't think not liking the  smell makes husband and wife bad people(what seriously? where's this  came from?). They weren't shown to be mean or malicious really. Yeah  they are snobbish/squeamish I guess but that's pretty minor flaw (murder  not warranted by my standards). They weren't angels but definitely not  BAD. And I'm not a fan of rich people(poor myself) but that makes no  sense. Main family wasn't good either, 4 scam artist that felt pretty  good with lying to people.(We get no back story to get to know  them/really feel for them/like them) But when people they are lying  through their teeth to not treating them as friends(equals?) the dad  gets crazy? Yeah it'd be good if everyone treated each other perfect but  that's life for you. If you can't handle that, better go try to change  sociopolitical climate in your country(world) or something, end social  inequality, not kill people.

And Son getting rich at the end? What's the point of this whole thing then. Thematically.

fej8rn8,"Not a great movie but very well directed and acted.

People are simply behaving as simpletons getting easily impressed and raving it as a movie about class difference and stuffs. There are tons of such movies about rich & poor.

For me, its just a story about a con family with the head member snapping at the end. Its more about Tarantino-like situations, twists & turns, dark humour and less about the entire plot/theme.  The movie has a sure shot influence from Spanish film 'The Hidden Face' & the horror film 'Don't breathe' wherein the movie suddenly takes a turn to reveal a new character hiding in a basement. So its not completely original also.

I'm a great fan of Bong Joon Ho and 'Memories of Murder' & 'Host'  are among my favourites.  Infact they are a step better than this.

Overall 7.5/10

The family is shown intelligent at first (scheming plans to get into the Park family). Later they are shown dull & naïve doing foolish things like entering the bunker all alone, suddenly falling in love with a rock, not realizing that a simple perfume can solve Ki-Taek's body odor, questioning Park's love for his wife which is totally irrelevant and stuffs like that.",dps3xy

In Parasite movie, I especially dislike the fact that the father went straight ahead and killed the house owner while his daughter was literally dying. and then predictably, he went to hide inside the basement.

fh1xvs4,"That was the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Is it a comedy? Drama? Tragedy? Slasher? Horror? Crime? The movie itself doesn't know. The movie insults the audience's intelligence, everyone with a brain knows that a young man that speaks fluent English, a young artist, a driver, and a maid can get a job in the 13th biggest country in the world (By GDP). 

The only message of this movie is ""Rich bad and dumb, while poor is good and smart"". 

The movie also has way too many ""Sike you thought"" moments. Let me give you some examples: 

When Mr. Parks and Mrs. Parks get woken up by their son and Mr. Kim is laying on the floor, but sike, they don't notice him.

Doorbells rings while the family is eating, but sike, it's the old housekeeper.

and so on and on.

Good film, but not better than Once...Hollywood, or Joker. 

I was a little surprised by some of the plot contrivances that are common in Asian films but not in Oscar winners. I really felt that the Committee obviously went for a statement with this movie winning Best Picture. 

It's a pretty literal and obvious statement on class divisions and inequality. Which working class members having to fight each other for exposure to the wealthy class who can be oblivious to the exploitation they use on the working class. 

We all kinda know this already. But what I really liked was the statement that we must rise up and kill the wealthy class. Only blood will wake them out of their protected lives.

Then I learn he is working for other Korean expats and I realise the stereotype is so true. He felt the need to have a Benz because his boss had a Benz. He was never going to buy any other car.

 Side note the A-Class literally broke down the day after he changed the ownership, was out of action for 6 weeks as they needed parts from Singapore and cost 3000 to fix (double what they paid for it) and as they turned out of the street from the mechanic they were hit by a truck and the car was written off.

This is customary for Koreans and actually a bit funny. Many Koreans say not to bring gifts, but it is always expected that the guests bring gifts to an event (especially a birthday party). If you don’t bring a gift, it’s considered disrespectful.


Holy crap that sounds infuriating. Is that also an upper class thing or is that just customary throughout South Korea? That sounds like a really easy way to immediately put someone in an awkward situation if they don't know.",dps3xy

fj5vadm,I think what was great foreshadowing was in the beginning when the pizza lady was talking to the mom and the son knew about an open position they had.

fg5k5ub,I thought it was to show how Mr Kim comes close to crossing the line Mr Park mentions a couple times. The first time Mr Kim asked was after Mr Park said his household would fall apart in days with his wife being in charge without any help.

This was reinforced on the couch sex scene when he got off on her acting dumb and poor,dps3xy
fh2pygj,"I have a different view to what people here have mentioned. And that's how Mr. Park got to the top. People like Mr. Park in many cases think differently to how the average person thinks - and that includes how they approach relationships. It reminds me of an interview with Donald Trump's wife where they quizzed her about their love and she kind of backed off a little said ""it's a little unconventional but you could call it love"". The point is that Mr. Park is an over achiever - and he has a small element of psycopathy that has helped him get to the level that he is - he sees/treats people in a utilitarian fashion to get to where he needs to go - and that includes everyone in his life including his wife. 

The point is - he sees the world differently from the poor - who buy into Disney movies and everything that is fed to them. He has an agreement with his wife - an arrangement more so. I've met a lot of people who do this who have more money - they just see relationships as different - almost like a contractual agreement... which by the way is what marriage really is when you think about it.",dps3xy

fb60zx0,"Yeah, a lot of lesser movies try to balance tone like that and it either ends up being jarring or means you can't take the serious bits, well, seriously.

Not Parasite though. The way it toed the line between outright comedy and serious thriller was masterful, and so well done.

I'm glad you've said this as it's exactly what I thought, having just seen it, though I haven't seen it much among other commenters. You can imagine a situation where the two families cooperate - sneaking food down to the husband and so on - but they deny it, whether because they see themselves as better (sub-basement vs basement), or they don't want to share the wealth, or because of the risk associated.

fodzik6,"Another aspect of the scholar rock: The first night the family spent in the rich house (without the rock being present), was the night that everything went to shit. 

My theory is that the rock was also meant as ""the first step"" to eventual success–a rock that they could build off of to eventually achieve something greater–they just need to start one rock at a time, then another, then another, and eventually have an extraordinary structure. Conversely, the beautiful stone mansion is the eventual goal, the final grand structure they hope to achieve, and the final amalgamation of thousands of those smaller stones.

The Kim family gets this gift of a single stone, a first step towards success. But then greed set in; aspirations towards wealth tend to do that. To get all 4 of them employed by the Park family they lie about the driver and housekeeper, ruining their lives. Then when the Park family is gone, they spend the night in the mansion, abandoning their own stone in their old house. Thus, they steal the eventual finished product for themselves while simultaneously abandoning their only legitimately given stone to drown in the flood. That was the night that their entire plan crumbled.

Then at the end of the movie, Ki-Woo places the stone in a riverbed amongst many other stones of its kind while saying ""Today I made a plan, a fundamental plan. I am going to earn money."" this time legitimately, with the stone placed as the foundation and building from there.",dps3xy

He even went so far as to cover his nose from ""the smell"" of the lower class when turning over the man's body to get the car keys.  Every action of Mr. Park in that moment treats lower individuals as tools or obstacles.  Do your job, ""don't cross the line"", and we'll all get along fine.  Putting others' well-being equal to his son's (especially *poor* people), would require him to ""cross the line"" into humanizing the non-rich.",dps3xy

He is forced to remain silent while hearing the Parks discuss his odor, how much they dislike it, and how it reminds them of common people, radishes, and the subway.  Twice in the film we see Kim stifle a reaction when he sees Mr. and Mrs. Park wincing at his smell in the car. 

When the Man in the Basement emerges, he's possibly not washed himself in a year or longer. He's also covered in roasted meat, stabbed with a burning rotisserie, and possibly his own flesh is roasting as well. In short, he stinks. Mr. Kim sees Mr. Park pinch his nose, and this is what sets him off. Everyone below you stinks, do they? Your nostrils are offended, huh?

Then Mr. Kim really starts to cross the line. Swearing in the presence of your superiors is a disrespectful manner in eastern cultures. Mr. Kim swears to the truck driver and Mr. Park is shown surprised as he is questioning how the driver dared to swear right in front of him. Mr. Kim proceeds by telling Mr. Park what to do with the high end business card. Mr. Park reacts to ''his driver instructing his boss'' by ordering him to focus on the road because that manner is also unacceptible for him. That’s the actual “stay in your lane”.",dps3xy

He is discussing how he was this prestigious driver being poached by this company and how he decided to take the job with Mr Park instead. Seemingly crossing that line and as this happens and truck cuts him off and makes him focus on driving again.

>It’s almost like a “stay in your lane” metaphor and it even causes Mr Kim to be like “hey focus on the road” don’t keep looking at me back here.

I don't fully agree with this.  When Kim gets cut off in traffic he swears at the other driver and Park completely changes his demeanor afterwards.  Prior to that point, they were very friendly but I think the language reminded Park of the divide between the two.  

When he tells him to watch the road, I think it is purely Park seeing Kim as not being careful or attentive enough, and seeing the flaw in Kim's one skill.  Even as a viewer, I was repeatedly yelling at Kim to watch the road because he was so frequently turning around.  One mistake and Kim could have gotten his entire family fired because of being the weak link in their referential chain.  I think this contrasts Mr Kim as being the boat anchor in his family while Mr Park is the most important and skilled member of his own family.",dps3xy

- Parks: have a big house with decent privacy for intimacy; Kims: zero space, zero privacy.

- Parks: have a nice lawn where their son can pretend to be camping; Kims: have drunks nearly pissing into their living room.

- Parks: pretend that it’s like having sex in the back of a parked car;  Kims: don’t own a car anymore and haven’t for years (Mr. Kim can drive and knows the area, but the in-car tech is all new to him).

- Parks: “Feed me drugs”, pretending to be the girl that the previous driver supposedly slept with, because in Mrs. Park’s mind, only low-class people do drugs;  Kims: stone sober, aside from cheap beer that they can only afford once in a while.

And finally, the Kims had to carefully sneak away under the cover of darkness, just like the cockroaches that they joked about earlier.",dps3xy

f8d468f,"The point was that it was out-of-character. Not only was Mr. Park materially poor, but his character (and by this I mean his virtues) was also poor.

Consider Carl Jung and the Shadow. The Shadow is the repository for all the things you condemn, all of the things you find unfit for your more active personality. It's quite obvious that the Kims HATE being poor, and they treat the poor with this contempt. In other words, do not remind Mr. Kim that he is poor, or else, the shadow comes out.

Nevertheless, Mr. Kim's shadow comes out. Remember, what does it for Mr. Kim is his built up resentment, not for Mr. Park, but for how Mr. Park constantly reminds him that he belongs to the underclass. It's at the exact moment when Mr. Park rears back in disgust at the smell of the maid's husband that Mr. Kim snaps due to his wounded pride. He realizes that he and the maid's husband are the same pathetic underdwellers who smell the same, and his shadow overtakes his usual, happy-go-lucky personality. Afterwards, Mr. Kim is absolutely distraught and traumatized at what happened. He says, literally, ""I don't know what happened,"" and apologizes profusely to the poster of Mr. Park in the basement, in the same manner that the maid's husband worshiped it.

So no, this was not a ""righteous killing of a despicable 1%er."" This was a horrifying and shameful lack of self-control and self-awareness on Mr. Kim's part. He definitely feels that way afterwards. After all, in this movie, people only look out for their own families and fuck everyone else. To expect help from Mr. Park is hypocritical (not that Mr. Park even knew they were family). Mr. Kim, and his daughter especially (remember she's the best con of them all), got what they deserved.

Many think this movie is another 1%er basher. It's actually a trap. It's heavily critical of the poor and leaves the rich, for the most part, alone.",dps3xy

there is some very subtle foreshadowing right before that when Ki and Park are in the bushes. 

Throughout the movie Park mentions several times that he liked Ki because he ""never crossed the line"". The line of course being the one between business and personal. 

When they are in the bushes Ki makes a remark about how Park loves his wife, Park (in not too many words) pauses for a sec and reminds Ki that this is just business and he's being paid for the extra service.

I was also really conflicted about which characters to sympathize with. Sure, the Kims manipulated the Park family and lied and forged their way into (what they think) are decent jobs, but the Park family paid them in peanuts. In the scene where she stuffs money into an envelope for the first tutoring session she removes like 75% of what she was originally going to pay him.

My friends and I were just debating the father's arc, asking ""what drove him to stab Mr. Park?"" Mr. Kim reveals himself to be the weakest link in so many scenes. His empathy for the driver that got fired (that the daughter wants to hear nothing of), not washing his hands, ""crossing the line"" discussing Mr. Kim's love for his wife, and his smell especially. He's the one that can't keep up. 

His daughter is bleeding out on the grass, and even despite her taking on the appearance of a dignified art therapist, she is still insignificant compared to the child who merely fainted (BS on seizures, the mother is overstating her son's condition). 

It seemed at one point the family had grand plans of moving into the house, even rising to equal status through marriage, but as Mr. Kim's house drowns is sewage it becomes clear (as with all his failed business ventures) that his situation is hopeless. He will never escape, his circumstances handicap him, and they have literally handicapped his son.

f5zob7g,"I remember one little neat detail from watching this a few months back that few people picked up.

- When Mrs. Park starts asking her husband for drugs while he’s fingering her on the couch, you realise an earlier scene had relevance. When Mr. Park brings up the panties in the car and what else the driver might have been doing in the car, alluding to drugs, Mrs. Park blurts out “cocaine” and “OxyContin”. Now, Korea is super super strict on drugs of any kind, it’s not engrained into their culture. The average Korean could probably reference cocaine due to it’s glamorisation in American culture and entertainment but it’s highly unlikely the average Korean housewife has even heard of OxyContin. It’s then that Mrs. Park’s dirty little secret comes to life: that although she maintains the perfect little rich housewife persona, the truth about her is her husband found her when she was an American college party girl and she has no actual skills or qualities (can’t cook, can’t clean, no notable career) other then being lucky enough to be picked and married to a handsome rich bachelor.

Very well said. I've read other people trying to gauge the ethics of the Parks based on their actions, when the film seems to be clearly emphasizing their conflict with the Kims, and other lower classes, as innate to their class disconnect.

f769m3p,"Agreed, excerpt from another reply I made:

I think it's visible that Jessica is the most talented of the Kims and her success in tutoring the son is just another sign of it:

* The story sets her up as the only person with a real tangible skill in the Kim family - art.
* She cannot afford art lessons, but her art skill is recognized by Min and her family. She even generates a business card for ""The Care"" that impresses even the upper-class Mr. Park by its classy design (she doesn't even have Photoshop at home to practice on).
* Jessica is the only person who does not replace an existing worker, getting in by partial merit.
   * Let's remember that although she is scamming the Park family in the ""therapy"" portion of the ""art therapy"", she actually is very skilled and is likely passionate about art.
* She is described as looking to belong in the rich house unlike rest of the Kim family.

Unlike Kevin, who failed the entrance exam 4 times (while not appearing to be a dimwit himself), she was great artist even without being able to afford lessons. I think I could imagine her using the funds scammed from the Park family to attend art school if things had played out differently.

I think that's what makes her death so tragic.

To me, she represented the hope of mobility from the lower class into the upper class, and her death made the hope seem futile.",dps3xy

fghf77i,"> The scenes with the drunk guy peeing in the street by the Kims basement home may seem just for laughs but it showed that while the family had basically nothing they still had their pride and this is what made them dangerous.

But deep down there is pain, resentment, pride and anger. He reacts so badly to his wife's claim that he'll scatter when he's exposed because he knows its true. He claims he's just acting when he reacts violently, but the truth is he's actually acting constantly and that was one of the few moments he was being real. The whole family aren't just acting to leech off of the Parks. They lie and act constantly day to day with others and to themselves.

And Mrs. Park's use of English phrases is signaling -- whether she knew it or not -- that she was rich enough to afford English lessons.

The correlation for us in the USA is like buying Swiss chocolates instead of plain old Hershey's, or using an imported Italian coffee pot, or saying *""je ne sais quoi""* instead of ""I dunno wut"".

fkalrot,"Some details that you got wrong — but, IMO, also strengthen your analysis:

- The stink bug that Ki-taek flicked away wasn’t a stink bug at all, it was a cricket (I’m pretty sure of that).  If it’s a cricket, then hurting or killing it brings bad luck to the house.  Maybe they used a cricket because it’s easier to hire a “cricket wrangler” for shooting the film, and maybe Bong (and his subtitle translator) wanted to make the point that it’s supposed to be a stink bug for the story, but I haven’t seen anyone else talk about it yet (besides myself a week or two ago).

- Ki-taek didn’t injure the maid, and he didn’t fight off the drunk guy, either.  I don’t think he got into any physical confrontations before stabbing Mr. Park (and, of course, nearly going off on his wife right after muttering, “I’m tired of this shit.”).  His rage was building even more silently than you said — he didn’t answer when his kids asked again if they could close the window against the bug spray — which made his snap more severe and dramatic.

- You’re right, IMO, about the symbolism of Geun-se operating the lights.  And if you think about modern automatic sensor switches, the symbolism still stands, because the switches themselves are assembled by low-skilled, low-wage workers in a big factory somewhere — meaning that the convenience is built on the labor of the poor.

Good call about the big dining room table, though.  I can tell you that although my wife and I aren’t anywhere near as rich as the Parks (probably not even a hundredth), it took us a long time to be able to afford enough dining room space for a table that can, in a pinch, seat more than four people.

f8cyhaq,"I did not see this movie as commenting on capitalism. Maybe there's enough evidence for it, but if there is, I doubt it was the emphasis. I saw this movie as commentary on the psychology of resentment, rationalization, and shadow-possession.

The Kim's are likable, but absolutely pathological in their anti-social behavior toward the Parks. They use the wealth disparity to rationalize their behavior. They think because their victims are rich and dumb, it's okay. It's not. This is actually psychopathic behavior. Psychopaths often exploit people and brag about it because they feel their victims ""deserve it."" Even worse, the Parks are portrayed as decent, though perhaps easily-duped, people. They are naive.

It was not greed that screwed the Kims. It was pride. In this sense, the story was Dostoevskian. Dostoevsky often explored how pride drives people to behave irrationally. Every mistake in this movie--Mr. Kim murdering Mr. Park (and regretting it immensely for the guilt he felt afterward), or Mrs. Kim refusing to help the former housemaid out of an undeserved sense of superiority, etc.--was a result of undeserved pride.

This movie was a trap for those who enjoying hating on the 1%. It explores the poor psychopaths, and reminds us to watch out for the have-nots. After all, the poor are far more numerous, and so the base rate for psychopathy prevalence among them is far higher than among the rich. Wealth is not immoral. And poverty is not virtuous. That is why this movie was so refreshing.",dps3xy

When she’s on the intercom begging she forgot something, the correct answer would be to come back when the Parks are home.  Even if it’s a “normal” person, you don’t let a previously fired employee back in the building by themselves to get items.  She could have been stealing jewelry or whatever.

f81ke5t,"At the same time, no one is a ""good person"" in this movie. including the lower class characters.

The kims are lazy, as indicated by their haphazard folding of pizza boxes, and simply assuming they can master fast folding just by watching a youtube video. Not to mention there's a whole slippery slope of immoral things- from forgery (you don't do that in asian culture. not when so many people break their fucking necks to study for college placement exams) to getting the driver/housekeeper fired.

The father pretends to be asleep, yet, is jobless. His greatest achievement in life is winning some track and field metal in highschool. Though, he becomes easier to sympathize with listening to his talk in the shelter about making no plans, because life shits on those plans anyway. Perhaps he tried to go pro-athlete and something happened to screwed up his career. Assuming he isn't naturally lazy, the only other explanation is that he is truly broken.

After the Kims get paid for the pizza boxes, they spend their money on beer and snacks, yet complain there is no food. Upon receiving of the ""good fortune"" rock, they spend great amount of time washing it, placing their faith in the symbol. Not sure if this speaks to dire times or expecting someone else to get you out of trouble. 

The son also does not confront reality. He's failed his college entrance exams 3 times already, yet he keeps telling himself ""i'll get in next year""... Just like he tells himself he will somehow amass enough money to buy that house.

Then the silliest suggestion can dramatically alter the lives of the poor people that do their bidding. That’s what the planning thing means. All those families and lives were basically at the whim of one silly lady who was a sucker for whoever last said something to her. 


Also, the bad things about the poor families were more reflective of capitalism than the deficiencies of poor folks. They take shitty jobs because they’re not given opportunity. They debase themselves to try to curry favor with the wealthy to escape poverty. They fight amongst themselves for literal scraps from the wealthy. While the poor families did bad things, it was pretty much solely because they were placed in really bad situations that forced their hands.",dps3xy

Mr Kim immediately recognizes this and sees that if Mr kim survives this, he might be the only person able to testify against his family because he'd be able to put two and two together to figure out that the smell he recognizes is Mr Kim, and his family (because remember?

In the scene where the pizza girl mentions 1/4 of the boxes were improperly folded, it is hinted that those boxes were the dads. This symbolizes his inability to integrate himself into society.

He also chose not to help the house keeper when he noticed she was bleeding from the back of her head because it would have meant exposing himself and his family to the parks. He even chose not to mention the house keepers condition to the rest of his family misleading them to think the situation in the basement was fine. 

The director in an interview stated that, in hindsight, he wished he named the movie Parasites with a plural ‘s’ so that there would be no confusion there are more than one parasite, and in this movie, everyone is a parasite.

You’re right about the fake out - just made the emotional punch to the gut even worse. Apparently, it would take Ki-woo 500 years to buy that house with a normal salary. What was already an impossible dream slips even further out of reach.

It’s interesting to me that this, honestly, was one of the most depressing films I’ve ever seen. It’s a tragic reality so pressing to so many of us.

Koreans have this thing called ""Han"" and it tends to make us very passionate which can be good, but also bad.  When you're comfortable at the top, you lose that vigor, the hungry mindset. To Mrs. Park, that's an unbelievably important lesson because she can hire tutors to teach her kids the knowledge, but instilling a hunger and drive when it's so easy to just coast is something you can't teach easily.

It then becomes archetypal. He needs to rescue his father from the underworld (his father is literally locked away in the basement).

f76xp1r,"I speak Korean, and the subtitles may not have fully explained some of the subtleties of the situation.

1. She got beat up by loan sharks.
2. I am sure that Kevin was going to kill them. The most sympathetic character in the family is the father (Ki-taek) who never fits in the family, but the son can be quite pragmatic in making his choices. He felt like it was his burden (as symbolized by the rock) to take care of the situation that tracks all the way back to himself. He is the oldest son and feels responsible for his family. He even seems reluctant about his choice when he talks to his girlfriend (Da-hye) before he goes down to the basement, but he knows he has to do it.
3. There was no outcome, and that is the point. The husband (the lower class) makes a desperate attempt to send signals to the outside world, but the kid sees it as some play, even though the son actually translated his ""HELP"" signal. This theme (modes of communication) is seen throughout the film. The lower class lacks the method of communication (wifi and morse code), while communication is merely a child's play for the upper class (walkie-talkie).

As for the last questions:

I think the Park family (now down to three) will probably lose their high status. It is easy to go down, but it is never easy to go up (kind of suggested in the flood scene; water never flows up, only down). The dad could have been better off in prison, but I believe it was his eventual fate to continue living as a parasite (he is the only one who does not cough in the fumigation scene).",dps3xy

>Another way the Park family didn't appreciate something, in this case the Boy Scouts. To them it was just something for him to do, join.  The teepee, bow and arrows (from America) were more important to them than what he learned in the Scouts...had they paid attention, things could have been different. Their son caught on to so much more, he was still young and his mind wasn't as polluted yet. Even Kevin caught the morse code.",dps3xy

fai6g4f,"That sequence of her planning the party also helped cement just how out of touch she was from everyone below her class.  Mr. Kim and his family had just lost their apartment (he still smelled bad enough that she couldn’t help reacting to him) — heck, his whole neighborhood had to go to the shelter — and she’s blithely tossing groceries into the cart, boasting about how her son doesn’t need any presents (saying “oh, no need to bring presents” is another way of saying, “we’re SO rich!”), chattering about her friend bringing their cello (they ain’t cheap, either)...   I mean, she has the Mini Cooper hide in the garage because it’s not fancy enough to show off near their gate, but the Kims haven’t been able to afford a car in *years*. 

And — unless she’s ordering him around — *not once* does she speak to Mr. Kim.

fn7g9pw,">Great movie tbqh. I may go on an unpopular opinion hear but I actually hated the Kim's. I felt the parks were actually quite nice. I was really sad when mr.park died.

I think that is the point.  Everyone is nice, but our structures make for hating one another.  The two families trying to live off the rich family is how society is setup.  Then you basically have the two poor families nearly killing each other or setting up schemes to take one another down just to service the rich family.

In the end the poor families end up either worshipping the rich family or hating other poor families just trying to survive.

Essentially we have built a predatory competition to service the rich, who may also be nice, and the poor families nice, but the system makes it so cutthroat that you end up destroying each other.  Had the two poor families worked together they could have ended up better and also not killed the rich family.

The basement was metaphorically where poor people are put and live off service to rich and scraps. The poor people get frustrated and either end up worshipping the rich or hating them, then usually attacking one another based on these realities.

Overall it was a class metaphor.

The final part where it looked like the son/kid Ki Woo had success then woke up was a reality check, forever just a dream. The son/kid Ki Woo would forever carry the weight of poverty as symbolized by the rock that he said clings to him, he can't shake it, it almost killed him, another poor person almost used his weight to kill him just like he almost killed them with it.  The poor people outnumber the rich but they tear each other apart in poverty and competition to service the rich.",dps3xy

They would have virtually no motive to commit ANY of the wrongs you mentioned. 

I think the Kim's were completely in the wrong. But I would acknowledge that their motives are tied to financial gain which itself is tied to their shitty economic situation.

I also wanted the Kim's to be found out & arrested. Some kind of justice for the crimes they committed. Maybe their dad being in the basement is punishment? 

That also seems strange, like why stay there? If there was even a small window of time where no one was in the house, he could have got out, right?

f7abkjf,"> The rain is fun for the rich, you can play outside in your tent, fool around in the comfort of your home, while basement dwellers drown in shit etc.

I was pointing out that exact thing to my sister and mom on the way home. I was like, look how to the rich the rain is just a minor inconvenience, while the poor are literally having to abandon their homes because it is being flooded with water and shit. 

I also thought that the son spending the night in his tent was telling. He radioed his dad was like, I am having a hard time sleeping. And the dad said (and I think the choice of wording here was very intentional) why don't you just come inside and sleep in your warm bed. 

Like, to the rich this is all a game. Sleeping outside in a tent, even when it's pouring rain, is just fun. The kid can come inside any time he wants and go back to his nice warm bed in his huge expensive house. For the poor (including, presumably, for the homeless man who used to pee outside) it's not a game. They don't have a nice warm bed to go back to, they don't have a nice house to return to. Sleeping outside, or sleeping in less than ideal conditions (a basement apartment, a shelter) is all they have. To them it's not an option.

I wonder if there is some symbolic rebirth in the water. The flood feels biblical, but most legendary floods are both disasters and rebirths of mankind. There's that scene where they talk about money smoothing the problems away like an iron. But that's also the way water smoothes away a rock.

Maybe the jagged rock is meanness, greed and rebellion against the class system (fitting with the rock supposedly bringing wealth) and the smoothed rock is submission to the class system. The weight of the smoothing water upon the poor is so powerful that they must cling to whatever meanness and individuality they have. That doesn't explain why the rock is eventually left in water even though Kevin still has dreams of upward mobility.

These are all loose ideas but maybe there's something there.",dps3xy

in my opinion it's probably the directors attempt at saying - lets be honest what the fuck did you expect?

 When the poor house is flooded the rock is floating. Do rocks float? do poor people magically have happy endings? No. And in this movie poor people will sink as well even though for a brief moment the director allowed them to float. Just for the purpose of the movie. And don't you forget it.

fmz0b3l,"This is all just a working thought, but I wonder if the rock symbolized the Kim's pursuit of wealth and class progression. The tutor friend told him the rock could bring wealth. The rock didn't really contain any power- it was pretty useless and without any real meaning. But Ki-woo probably believed his friend's words, and clung to it as a result. Whether it was real power, or the symbolic power of an individual's dream, I think the question might be: what is the power of a rock or a dream? And in terms of dreams, what is the use, point, value, and probability of that dream? When are our dreams just mere rocks? Do we cling on to false hope? Or do we cling onto ideas past their expiration, or at the expense of our own undoing? Or others undoing?

&nbsp;

Even in the midst of the Kim's aspirations being severely disrupted (clash with prior housekeeper's family), only for them to narrowly escape and witness their world be ravaged (flooding), Ki-woo still found value in the rock. He was losing everything and had little time to decide what of his life to save, and he chose the rock. In the gym he even stated that it kept clinging to him. Maybe ""the rock"" was actually *the dream of something more* that he ""claimed"" was clinging to him. *Yet in actuality, he was clinging on to it.* **HE** was the one that grabbed it from the flooded house, and **HE** was the one holding it tightly in his arms while they slept on the gym floor. He took that rock (or dream/aspiration) all the way back to the Park's home during the little boy's bday, likely intent on figuring out a plan to get them back on track. Essentially, the Kim family wouldn't or couldn't let go of *""that rock,""* even when the rock was doing nothing for them. They held it so desperately, which, eventually led to their downward spiral.

 &nbsp;

It was when Ki-woo stared out at the party below that he surmised the only way to attain his dream was to step on or get rid of the people literally and figuratively beneath them (hubby & wife in basement). That's kind of what the kim & park family's were already doing anyway- the park's used the kim's, and the kim's were at their mercy (not maliciously, rather it was just a part of the system). And the Kim family had ascended a bit, and as such, the fired housekeeper & her husband were at the Kim's mercy.

&nbsp;


Which goes to show, much of what we do may be pointless, but it is many times in desperation or longing for something. We cling on to what we want in life (may that be beauty, a family, or things), and try to make that want a reality. A side observation though: The Park's were at the top however, and when you're at the top, you don't always notice the grind happening underneath you. They were blind, preoccupied with their own existence & privilege, that they failed to notice the flood building in their own home and lives. Wow, it's late & I wrote more than i intended.

I felt like the message was to have resentment towards the society we've built that has allowed such cyclical cycles of wealth-inequality to exist. It's turns both the rich and poor into parasites. 

The Kim family were parasites in that they lied and manipulated the gullibleness of the Park family for their own benefit. They even did so at the detriment of others in their class (driver & housekeeper). 

The Park family were parasites in that they abuse the labor of the lower class for a negligible. They're quite nice until they think someone goes against their ideal image, then they dispose of them without much thought. 

The view is more negative against the Park family because the rich collectively have greater control of the system, but at the same time no single family can fix/control the system. That's why it's cyclical. To me, neither family was awful. They're selfish -- just as all humans are to some extent. And I think that selfishness is where I see signs of the Kims and Parks within myself. 

You may be nice for many for selfish reasons. Perhaps it makes you happy, or you want to befriend someone, or make a good impression on someone.

The viewer sees the sons dedication to achieve something nearly impossible in order to reunite his family, emotionally we feel his hope and determination, but logically we understand that the odds are insurmountable, the dice have already been rolled and hope and determination are probably not enough. I think rather the ending is a statement about hope and dedication to family in an unequal and cruel world.",dps3xy

I don’t believe they are actual murderers, at least not the kids. I believe the son was going downstairs to give the other family the stone as a sign of goodwill (others here seem to think he was going to kill them). But the parents seemed full of ill-intent during the movie, combining greed and machiavellism in their worst forms. Remember how the mother says, drinking in the park’s livingroom, that she would be nice too if she had money? Wealth is relative, and the Kims were much richer than the former maid. 10 minutes after saying that the mother is able to help the other family and she refuses, wanting all 4 jobs for themselves. I believe this shows that, even if she had all that wealth, her personality wouldn’t change.

But Mr. Park rebuffs each attempt, telling Mr. Kim to shut up and be a good dog... I mean, ""employee"".  No matter how close Mr. Kim gets physically, by being in the same car or wearing the same costume at the same birthday party, Mr. Park will never accept him as a friend or peer.  He'll always keep Mr. Kim at enough of a distance so he can pay him meager wages (~~no overtime for the birthday party~~ paid to be at the birthday party, but not invited as a guest or friend) and, if needed, fire him at will.  Remember, you'll never treat a friend of yours as poorly as Mr. Park treats the Kims.

Mr. Kim and his family have long thought that the main reason they aren't rich is just circumstantial.  They even believe that rich people ""are nice *because* they're rich"" since they don't have to constantly feel stressed about everyday things like food and rent.

The argument can also be made that the basement couple are in their situation because they're lazier than the Kims.  Moon-gwang was the housekeeper not necessarily because of skill, but only because of the recommendation from the previous homeowner; and Geun-se is hiding because he still owes a debt from his failed bakery business (which tried to follow the same Taiwanese sponge cake trend that Mr. Kim tried, too; but Mr. Kim doesn't appear to owe any debt).  So, in a twisted way, the basement couple rank below the Kims -- which gives the Kims the excuse to treat them poorly, just as the Parks are treating the Kims.

(I wrote this in another thread)  So instead of the story being simply ""Kims vs Parks"", now we can watch how the Kims treat people who are worse off than themselves.

At the beginning of the movie the Kim family son is given a rock that is supposed to bring wealth and fortune to the family. The son views this as a short cut of sorts. He thinks he can manipulate the capitalist system to get to the top, e.g. by marrying the parks daughter. He clings to this belief until he goes to kill crazy light guy. This belief is his ultimate undoing, he thought he could weasel his way to the top without hard work but he his not careful and he drops the rock and crazy light guy, who represents a cog in the capitalist machine (an unseen force that is being exploited to further propagate the capitalist machine, although he does not realize he is being exploited), takes this naive outlook on exploiting capitalism and literally beats it out of Kevin’s head. The metaphor being that there are no shortcuts to exploit capitalism for people who are from a low social class. After Kevin wakes up he no longer believes in shortcuts but he still believes in capitalism. He is now determined to go to school and earn money to work his way to the top honestly. But it is clear that this isn’t a true possibility for him. He will remain in the low class where he has always been. He represents the poor youth’s outlook on capitalism and explains how despite being victims with the cards stacked incredibly against them, they are still able to convince themselves that it is realistic for them to get rich, and can delude themselves into thinking capitalism can still serve them.

The sister, Jessica, is the most fit out of the whole family to actually get rich and get to the top of a capitalist society. She is smart and ruthless. When the rest of the family begins to feel guilt about getting the old driver fired she essentially says that they shouldn’t worry about them and only need to look out for themselves. When the old cleaning lady comes back and it comes to light that she too is a parasite is where this all gets interesting. Instead of working together, these two low class families fight bitterly for a place to serve the rich family. For everyone in the low class, this is their only place or hope in this society for a semi decent existence. An existence that consists of serving the rich and serving as an unseen backbone that supports their rich and comfortable lifestyle while they themselves are forced to act as parasites, leaching off resources where they can, but with no real hope of ever breaking the cycle. They are parasites and in the current system being a parasite is their only hope is survival. But rather than resenting the rich, they resent the other parasites who are also just trying to find a way to live. The poor fight the other poor for a chance to live as a parasite, rather than uniting and fighting the system that oppresses them and steals away any other opportunities. But with the threat of survival, food or no food, breathing down their necks they cannot think about the larger role of the system in their oppression. They are only thinking about how to keep their own families alive. This can be seen when crazy light guy comes out of the basement. He spares the rich and goes after the poor people who are essentially the same as him. He is blind to what is really happening and has been convinced that fellow poor people are the enemy rather than the system. He kills Jessica, the only Kim family member with a fighting chance of becoming rich. This to me symbolizes that even if you have what it takes, by design, if you are poor the fellow poor people/system will tear you down. The rich aren’t hindering Jessica but rather fellow poor people tear her down for occupying a position they covet themselves. So even Jessica, who has the drive and ability to get out of her caste is ultimately thwarted by those who only want the same thing. “Pull yourself up by your bootstraps” is not the whole story with capitalism, everything and everyone around you actively hinders upward mobility in a capitalist society if you are poor. An opportunity for you means that another poor person has been robbed of that same opportunity and they are spiteful about it.

Mr. Kim used to be young and naive about capitalism when he was young just like his son is now. He tried to open a bakery and it fell apart. And he has lost any hope of ever getting a different lot in life, as exemplified by him telling Kevin in the gym that there’s no point in making a plan because it will all fall apart. He has seen how capitalism works and he is jaded by it. As discussed in my previous post he kills mr park because of his disgust toward crazy light guy (representing poor people) while remaining ignorant to how poor people actually enable his lifestyle. He kills mr park but it is pointless. Mr park is not the main issue here. He is not evil, he has prospered in a flawed system that he does but realize is flawed. Mr park is not a malicious person and on his own he is not the problem or the enemy, capitalism is. This represents the fact the a single rich person is not the enemy within capitalism. The injustices of capitalism cannot be fixed by killing the rich or singling out a single rich person to project a systemic issue onto. The realities of capitalism need to be exposed and fixed on a larger scale and that does not include attacking a single rich person who has profited from the system. After mr Kim kills mr park he begins to flee but quickly realizes the reality of his situation. He has no other options; there are no alternatives to capitalism and taking out his anger on mr parks has not solved anything, another rich person will come along and fill the void he has created. He realizes that his only option is to become a cog in the capitalist system as crazy light guy was before him. He once again lives as a parasite and is in the shadows, out of the minds is the rich once again while simultaneously continuing the capitalist system- symbolized by his affection attitude of the new rich German family that has filled the void he created by killing mr parks. To actually change things the whole capitalism structure must be exposed and replaced, otherwise the poor remained doomed to their sad lives with no opportunity.

Lastly I think it is important to mention da-song. While mr and mrs parks are oblivious to the role of the poor in maintaining their wealth, da-song is not. While living in his oblivious comfort that he was born into and gorging himself on his birthright he actually glimpses the dark underbelly that supports his life style. He is haunted by this, as can be seen from his frequent paintings of crazy light guy. He can also recognize the kims as a lower class by their smell, which marks and dooms them as permanently stained by their current socioeconomic status. Indeed he is the only one of the parks that seems to see the plight of the poor. He alone sees crazy light guys message of “help me” though he does not act on it. Da song represents the new generation of rich realizing the human costs of their wealth and that the coming generation can no longer claim ignorance to the costs of their wealth. The park parents only understand the role of the poor in a vague way, mrs park says that ghosts in the house bring good fortune and that money had indeed been good while lamenting that it has distressed her son. This represents that the older rich people have a vague idea that the poor are the backbone of their success but nowhere near the understanding that the new generation does, who have seen the “ghosts” and recognize them as real and visceral beings that lurk in the shadows is their comfort. This brings a hopeful note for potential change to the capitalist system in the future as ignorance will soon no longer be a valid defense. Capitalism’s rosy perfume is beginning to wear and the smell of the shit it concealed is slowly leaking through.

>Da-hye not having good grades, but her mother implies that it doesn’t matter and will get into a good university anyway. This is a direct opposite of **Ki-woo, who kept failing university exams even though he’s actually smart** (but lacking vigor).

It's been suggested that the only reason he's not going to university is that he's broke, and that he's *passed* the annual exam several times, being hired by richer families to fraudulently get good grades for their dumber kids.  The recent big college admissions scandal here in the USA included exactly that kind of scheme.

>Now back to the suseok and natural things. Bong Joon-ho deliberately wants the rock to float during the flood. Why? Cause through Ki-woo’s eyes, the rock’s nature and purpose has been twisted. As a savior, and a murder weapon. Something he needs to do to “set things right.” **Note that from this point the custom made base is removed. It's no longer revered.

fl3jve3,You are applying western values to eastern people. Yes we have laws about age of consent but most of our society still don't think it's weird that a 20 something year old would date a high school student. I know a few people who do and no one bat's an eye unless it's a dad age guy trying to marry a high school person. One of my best friends told me to get a girl and recommends me a 16 yo and when I asked her how would she feel if her daughter (yes she has a baby) starts dating a 20's something guy at 16 she just told me if it's love it's love so yeah we're not there yet. Anyway i'm not korean but I assume it's something similar in their society too.,dps3xy
fkf6h8q,"Don't forget that Ki-woo's friend, Min, was probably fooling around with her, too.  Remember that Min also said that he'd officially ask her out when she enters college.

The age difference was bigger than you think, though.  Min-hyuk and Ki-woo had both done their military service (two years), and Ki-woo has taken the annual college entrance exam four times.  So they've been out of high school at least four years already, maybe six.

But again, Da-hye was likely getting intimate with both of them.  I think this says more about her emotional fragility.  She's been fairly neglected at home -- Mrs. Park doesn't spend any time with her (she'd rather sleep in the yard than help her study, and she didn't invite her to have ram-don, either).  I also doubt that anyone has had any serious talk about ""the birds and the bees"" with her.  And remember the moment when she asked ""Kevin"" if he thought ""Jessica"" was pretty -- she's seeking validation from him because she's not getting enough attention from her parents.

Regarding the Kim family appearing to encourage it -- I think they were mostly joking about it (especially when they were drinking) and teasing each other about the absurdity of serving their own in-laws.  But since Ki-woo talks about it like it's part of his plan, then perhaps it really is, and he's hoping to get into the Park family through Da-hye.

Side note:  We think that Min-hyuk is trusting Ki-woo to stay on his side of ""the line"" between the classes and *not* try dating Da-hye.",dps3xy

I presume Jessica would have had a laissez-faire style that would allow the boy to work the way he wants.

If I were to dig a bit deeper, I also think it's visible that Jessica is the most talented of the Kims and her success in tutoring the son is just another sign of it:

* The story sets her up as the only person with a real tangible skill in the Kim family - art.
* She cannot afford art lessons, but her art skill is recognized by Min and her family. She even generates a business card for ""The Care"" that impresses even the upper-class Mr. Park by its classy design (she doesn't even have Photoshop at home to practice on).
* Jessica is the only person who does not replace an existing worker, getting in by partial merit.
   * Let's remember that although she is scamming the Park family in the ""therapy"" portion of the ""art therapy"", she actually is very skilled and is likely passionate about art.
* She is described as looking to belong in the rich house unlike rest of the Kim family.

Unlike Kevin, who failed the entrance exam 4 times (while not appearing to be a dimwit himself), she was great artist even without being able to afford lessons. I think I could imagine her using the funds scammed from the Park family to attend art school if things had played out differently.

I think that's what makes her death so tragic.

I think if that were an English language film it would be accused of being too obvious and expository. 

The jarring tonal shifts were also a little annoying - tries to be darkly funny and then thrilling and brutal but I didn't think it quite worked at all times.

While they were daring to dream of their eldest son marrying into wealth, I think that the lifestyle they had crawled to over the course of the first two acts of the movie was not an overindulgent or unnecessary one.

Their main sin early on was getting their fellow working class people fired, but they did have some reason to believe that well-qualified candidates would have an easier time finding work than themselves (who seemed to lack any formal qualifications and have trouble even holding down a pizza box folding job.) They didn't realize that the housekeeper, Moon-gwang, was also in a pretty shitty situation with her husband and barely getting by.

Maybe instead of an angle about ""ambition for wealth"" there could be an interpretation about poor people having to ""lie by omission"" to their rich employers. If Moon-gwang had not maintained an air of hyper-competence and having everything under control (a mask she always wore to hide a precarious situation involving her husband) then the Kim family wouldn't have assumed it was okay to get her fired, on the assumption she was sure to land on her feet.",dps3xy

But, as far as the movie is concerned, I think we are losing the real point of the rock. I quote the director Bong Joon Ho from an interview woth Polygon:

**Q: Where did the idea come from to use the scholar’s rock? There were a bunch of them around my grandfather’s apartment but I never really got what they were.** 

A:  My dad used to collect them, too. He quit doing it because they were so heavy. We’d go to mountains looking for these scholar’s rocks, basically just picking up rocks. It’s a weird thing. I’m 50, and there’s no one in my generation — my colleagues, my friends — who collects these things anymore. Rocks? Why?

In the movie, that this young guy is giving it as a gift is a strange thing. The vibe in the movie is strange, too, with him saying it’s symbolic. I can’t let anyone unfamiliar with scholar’s rocks pass it over, I have to create that odd mood. For actors and directors, I think that’s a big feat. \[Laughs\] Even though I’m the one who said it, I know it sounds weird. But, for foreigners seeing this stuff, thinking, “That’s weird, why is that in there? Does that have to be there? Is it a symbol?” Well, the actor outright says it’s a symbol, so it’s even weirder. “So maybe it’s not a symbol?”

At the beginning, it’s supposedly metaphorical, and then by the end, it’s a literal weapon used to smash in somebody’s head. I think the rock brings an extra layer to the story. It feels like this cursed object, and it ends up being covered in blood. It tells the whole story of all of these horrible events.

Hm I doubt it. It's a common (and problematic) assumption that hard work = rich. People don't just pull themselves out of poverty because they *really really* want to this time. That whole ""work hard and you'll be rewarded"" mantra is a lie, a scam, a pipe dream for poor people to endlessly and pointlessly aspire to. The idea that everyone can elevate from their situation by simply working harder and pulling up their bootstraps has barely, if ever, worked. There are so many systems in place that make poverty an endless feedback loop, not something one can easily jump out of. Not that it's impossible, but breaking free goes beyond your vigor/motivation/how hard  you work. Why are there so many folks trapped in poverty who work 2 full time jobs after all?

I believe the ending was meant to show you that Ki-woo is young, optimistic and still naive. He clings to the idea that hard work will one day shower him with riches and unite his family.

I mean, if he had planned on killing the couple, why did he show so much concern for the lady who was unconscious?  If I remember correctly, when she was laying on the ground after hitting her head, he asked her if she was okay.  If he intended to kill them, why would he bother to show compassion to the woman?

My best guess is that instead of attempting to control him, she earned his respect by sitting with him and showing interest in his paintings.  (you know, like a good mother or friendly big sister would do)

We only see her doing this twice — once during the peach fuzz montage, and again when Mrs. Kim brings a plate of fruit.  But we only *see* her, while we don’t *hear* anything she’s saying to him.  So all we can do for now is guess.

He wanted to go down there and patch things up.  He intended to give them the scholar's stone as a gesture of goodwill, hoping that it'll bring them good fortune.  This is, in fact, how Bong has said he told Choi Woo-sik to play that scene.

Or -- he's planning to kill them and prevent the secret from being revealed.  After all, Geun-se never truly existed in the Parks' minds, and neither did they care where Moon-gwang had gone, so making sure they're dead is the most surefire way to preserve the plan.  He also likely expected them both to still be tied up, because that's how he last saw them -- so they would have been easy targets.

But didn't Bong tell the actor to portray the scene as if he would ask for forgiveness?  Yes -- but that's different from Bong explicitly saying that *the character named ""Ki-woo""* was going to ask for forgiveness.

The plight of the poor is interfering with the comforts of the rich. His conscience is okay with her struggling because hey, he’s paying her to struggle so that his family can live in luxury.

The poor father was motivated to kill the rich father because he obviously aspired to lift himself out of poverty and join the ranks of the rich.

Circumstances drove the Kims to act the way they do--it sounded like they would've been happy to have mundane middle class jobs, but those weren't available to them. So I sympathize with their plight while also wouldn't let them into my home in a million years if I was rich enough to afford a house staff.

Similarly, the rich family was self centered and a bit callous toward the effect of firing their staff would have on those people's lives (like they really don't consider how something that means relatively little to them can be life changing for their household staff, perfectly crystalized in the mother's conversation near the end of the movie where she thanks god for the rainy weather clearing off the smog while Mr. Kim's entire apartment just got flooded in a river of shit by it).

>The song ""Jessica"" used as part of her quasi-mnemonic for remembering her cover story prior to the interview uses the melody of a patriotic Korean song. Maybe something here because of the later references to North Korea.

That particular song, ""Dokdo Is Our Land"", is about the Dokdo Islands, a small group of islands that are still being contested between Korea and Japan.  I think that instead of North Korea, this references the always-edgy relationship with Japan.  Someone else pointed out that the Parks bought Japan-sourced seafood (crab meat, I think?) at the grocery store, and that one of the other characters spoke down about selling out one's country.  These bits speak to Japan's occupation of Korea during the first half of the 20th Century (and, arguably, how Japan has tried to whitewash the extent of what they did).

It also showed that while they felt they were pretty far down the social ladder, they also felt that at least they weren't at the very bottom -- which leaves them open to feeling superior to the old housekeeper and her husband later (plus feeling even more resentment as they hid under the coffee table like cockroaches).

(what I wrote earlier —- )

Going backwards, starting at the massacre at the party --

Remember that right after Kim stabbed Park, for a moment, he was in a daze, looking around at the people running, his son being carried off, and his daughter dying on the ground, when he snapped out of it and ran out of the yard and down the stairs.  He had simply snapped when he saw Park be so selfish as to take the only car for himself and not even try to get the other wounded people out of the house (the main threat, Geun-se, was dead by that point, so Park had no good reason to *not* evacuate the others).

A couple minutes earlier, when Kim and Park were hiding in the bushes to prepare their surprise, Park seemed happy to be organizing this bit of entertainment.  Kim, hoping to be included in this act of fatherly love, commented, ""You really love your family,""... but rather than respond with a Hollywood-washed, ""Yeah, Mr. Kim, I really do,"" Park turns cold and tells him, effectively, ""You're not here as a friend, you're still my driver, and I'm still your boss -- do what I tell you and that's it, capiche?""  **That's the door to the upper class being slammed in Kim's face.**

Earlier that day, fresh from finding borrowed clothes at the basketball arena-turned-refugee shelter -- and *maybe* getting a shower in the locker room -- Kim is nearly ignored by Mrs. Park as she has him drive all over town for expensive groceries and wine, treating him like a man-servant mule as she yammers on the phone with her friends about getting day-drunk and singing operatic sonnets in their rain-shower-freshened front yard.  Zero knowledge about the disaster at the bottom of the hill -- because **the Parks spend their money to stay uphill and actively maintain their ignorance**.

The night before, during their little party in the Parks' living room, the Kims pretty much agree that rich people are always nice.  Mr. Kim even shows a little humanity by wondering if the former driver and housemaid were able to score new jobs -- perhaps a mistaken assumption, though, as he seems to think that they were well-off already, being so close to the Parks by proximity alone.  But then Moon-gwang comes back, and the Kims see that she and her husband are actually even worse off -- and that the Parks simply *did not care* about what happened to their maid.  They discarded her like a moldy loaf of bread.  And that sentiment was driven home when the Kims were stuck under the table (like cockroaches) and had to listen to the Parks not only disparaging poor people, but also saying that their employees were acceptable only as long as they ""didn't cross the line"" into friendly relationships.

The preceding half of the film was mostly the Kims feeling that, just maybe this time, they were ascending the social ladder again.\*  Instead of folding pizza boxes, they got to dress a little nicer, spending time in a nice house and driving a nice car.  What they hadn't foreseen was how disposable they really were.  There's no such thing as career advancement for tutors, drivers, or housekeepers.  A clean suit worn by a private driver is simply a work uniform, just a different style than the polo shirt worn by the pizza shop manager.

\*Again -- the Kims had been better-off before, too.  Mrs. Kim has a silver medal from a national-level competition, so she knows how to work for success.  Mr. Kim tried his hand at running a business, and he probably would've done just fine if problems outside his control hadn't sunk the Taiwanese castella trend (indeed, he was better-off than Geun-se even though they both tried riding the same trend).  He also must've either owned his own car in the past, or at least worked as a driver, because he's smooth behind the wheel and doesn't even need GPS.  And I think he had even gotten into some level of lower-mid-management in the corporate world because of how comfortably he first spoke with Mr. Park.  One more thing: their apartment shows signs that they used to live in a bigger, nicer place -- they have a lot of stuff, and some of it looks like it hadn't been unpacked since they moved in.

**So the Kims have been trying to get back on the ladder for a long time.**  They've been taught, like you and I have been taught, that if they just keep grinding and working hard, they might be able to finally make it.  But that's not what happens at the end.  They get told, right to Mr. Kim's face, that they're not welcome, that they'll always be the underclass no matter how pleasantly they speak or dress, that -- **by Mr. Park saying ""Throw me the keys!"" instead of, ""Pick her up and let's get out of here!"", they're not worth any more than the dead homeless lunatic laying in the yard.**",dps3xy

(what I wrote earlier —


Of course we’re wondering [how she tamed him], because Bong kept it a secret.  He wanted us to be just as surprised as Mrs. Park was.

My best guess is that instead of attempting to control him, she earned his respect by sitting with him and showing interest in his paintings.  (you know, like a good mother or friendly big sister would do)

We only see her doing this twice — once during the peach fuzz montage, and again when Mrs. Kim brings a plate of fruit.  But we only *see* her, while we don’t *hear* anything she’s saying to him.  So all we can do for now is guess.

But the thing is that Kevin's plan is kinda shitty--to somehow get rich enough to buy the house outright so that his father can come out of hiding in the basement. The entire movie up to that point had showed how the Kim family had to grift, con, and hustle just to get ANY job, let alone a good one, let alone one that would make you the kind of money to buy the house. It's all a little naive/wishful, which struck me as strange, given the character of Kevin had been portrayed as quite savvy.

First, I think it’s interesting to point out Kiwoo’s possible fear of being excluded from the wealthy society (seen from his question to Dahye after they made out and his envy of how his sister fits in with the extravagant lifestyle). It appears that Dahye symbolises everything Kiwoo cannot be, like his ambitions of becoming rich and well-educated. Therefore, being her lover fills the void of his impossible aspirations and satisfies his pride and vanity.

On top of that, I suppose Kiwoo is *interested* in Dahye partly because his rich friend is also into her. I assume being somewhat similar to his wealthy and successful friend makes Kiwoo feel more “apt” in the upper class environment.",dps3xy

There is an article from Vulture about exactly same point you mentioned. How it is 'evil rich vs nice poor' in 'Knives out' and 'Ready or Not' while in Parasite it isnt uncomplicated like that.

Paragraph from Vulture.

If films like *Knives Out* and *Ready or Not* offer the most uncomplicated catharses, with the wealthy getting their just reward at the hands of scrappy, likable outsiders, then [*Parasite*](https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/parasite-movie-review-bong-joon-hos-latest-film.html) is at the other end of the scale. It provides no straightforward outlet for the fury building up inside it, so it seems to come as a sudden surprise to those who feel it, either the characters or the audience. [Bong Joon Ho](https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/bong-joon-ho-parasite.html)’s work has always dealt with the systemic, and the Parks, the wealthy clan around which the other characters in the thriller orbit, aren’t monsters. That’s important to understand because they enjoy such loathable, enviable lives as modern aristocrats ensconced behind the elegant walls of their glass-and-concrete palace, where they are cared for by a set of employees whom they talk to but only sometimes want to speak back. It wouldn’t take much to tip them into outright villainy, but if they were monsters, *Parasite* would be a movie about their particular comeuppance, and instead it’s about something darker and deeper.",dps3xy

The sister pretty much guessed, taking a shot in the dark: either the mother would imagine an episode which could be the source of her son's trauma, or she would naively believe something happened but she didn't know of it. While there was a real traumatic event for the child, the mother could have easily rationalised an otherwise trivial event, like a schoolyard fight or a bully, as the source of her son's ""uniqueness"" she was so obsessed to manufacture.

The child is a perfectly normal child, apart from suffering from epilepsy: he likes drawing, camping, and playing pretend.

I think that's the whole point it tries to make - like what Mrs Kim said about money being an iron, the Park's money shelters them and makes them ignorant to the suffering (and lots of other things) going on around them. We see the Kim family doing scummy things to get by because of their class, but in contrast, the Park's scumminess is not so much what they do with their power but what they *don't do* with it. 

I think where this comes through the strongest is at the end where Jessica is bleeding to death, but Mr Park only cares about helping his son who fainted from the secondhand shock. The Kim family are constantly suffering the direct blows of life - poverty, flooding, violence, and the Park family shelter and isolate themselves from all of that suffering completely. Part of ""crossing the line"" is that the Parks maintain a segregated world where they don't acknowledge the lower class as equals.

Their first business transaction with the Kims was Mrs. Park taking money out of the envelope that she was going to give to Ki-woo -- and then telling him that he's paying more than she paid Min before.  They started with a lie.

And to flesh out Mr. Kim's backstory and possible motivation -- remember that the part-time gig folding pizza boxes was thanks to his kids (and the neighbor's Wifi), not himself (notice how angrily he folded the boxes in that cloud of pesticide).  He used to run his own cake shop franchise, but it got tanked by some bad press that ruined the entire trend (the Taiwanese sponge cake trend from just a couple years ago).  He used to drive a lot, whether he owned a car or worked as a driver, which is why he knew his way around town without a GPS -- but he hasn't owned a car in so long, he never learned about the high-tech gadgets common in today's cars.

And after striving for so many years to get out of poverty, he finally hears what the upper class thinks of him and his family.  He loses nearly everything in a flood of shit, then he has to carry groceries for the wife as she boasts to her clique how beautiful her son's birthday party will be.

The fuse was lit while *Mrs.* Park didn’t give a shit about him after he lost everything in the flood.

Photoshop isnt extremley difficult to learn. And then when she was doing her job it was art therapy. She just had the boy color and made up psycho babel about it. It was a con.


Driving is basic.

So is housekeeping.


The only reason they got somewhat good money is they were working for incredibly rich people. They got by on recommendation alone. I believe the rich friend who gave the original recommendation to Kevin was a childhood friend who he knew from scouts.

They found one, and used the neighbor’s internet to make a deal with a pizza shop down the block to fold a couple hundred boxes for a little money (part time job).  They were folding the boxes when a city employee with a fumigator came nearby to spray pesticides on the sidewalks.  Mr. Kim made his kids leave their windows open to get “free” pest control and hopefully kill the cockroaches in their apartment — so they’re folding pizza boxes while coughing in a cloud of roach poison.

The pizza shop manager came by to pick up the boxes and said that a quarter of them were folded wrong and ruined.  (turns out it was Mr. Kim who folded them wrong — he was quietly pissed off at the whole situation and didn’t fold them carefully) She cut them a break by docking their pay 10% instead of 25% like you’d expect.

IMO, this was all important, because it set up several things.  It showed how broke they really were; it showed that Mr. Kim, although he puts up a cheerful face, is holding in how embarrassed and angry he is; Mr. Kim is possibly the least competent of the family, which no Korean father would be satisfied with; later, they eat at the same pizza shop, as if they’ve stepped up one rung and are now “above” the shop manager, so they may not be “humble poor” like we’ve been taught in so many other movies.",dps3xy

I don't think (anymore) that she's a druggie.

I think she's sleeping in the front yard because she can afford to be that lazy.  Plus, it shows that she's mostly useless for running the house, so she's likely to be just a trophy wife, married for her good looks over anything else.  (contrast that with the Kims, all four of whom need to work just to put food on the table)

It also shows that the yard is so much safer and more pleasant than the street in front of the Kims' apartment window.  And yes, the way it's shot (as mentioned in another comment) shows Moon-gwang crossing a visual line when she controls Mrs. Park instead of the other way around.",dps3xy

The son probably wanted to leave Moon-Gwang and her husband the rock as a gift out of pity for the two of them, the same way Min gave his family the rock in the beginning. And in the mother's words, food definitely would've been a better gift, because that wouldn't have left the insane husband with something to bludgeon the son with.

faa7ddi,">!spoiler!< 

I'm gonna respectfully disagree with you that these questions that are unanswered make the film ""not good."" Personally, I don't think a movie should answer every question blatantly to the audience. I think you asking these questions IS what makes the film good, and it's up to you to answer these questions in YOUR own away. YOU should come up with your own answers to these questions as an audience member. Good art (film is an art form to me) should do that. Nevertheless, personally, here's how I would answer your questions (these are merely my interpretations as an audience member.) 

1. Plans are clearly a motif in the film. A large theme of the film is how there is a large contrast in complexity between the classes. The poor always plan to get rich, but in society, it's rare that ever happens. So I like where you're starting. The poor do plan to get rich, but the wealth gap is an interesting and complex phenomenon, much like a ""plan."" That one scene where goes on about plans can be interpreted in a lot of other ways, and these echo throughout the film. The father says, ""the best plan is no plan."" This can suggest many things. For one, it's a way of teaching his son that nothing in life works out the way you think. It's a large commentary on the film itself. Because boy! That film did NOT turn out the way anyone thought. Developing this further, (so for another interpretation) his son doesn't listen. At the end of the film, the son HAS a plan to buy the house. But we see that the end of the film that is all a fantasy. Merely a ""plan."" What if he never earns the money to buy the house? That's more than plausible. A plan sets up one for disappointment, the father even says so. 

2. To me, the rock acted as an interesting symbol. It's a rock out of place. Much like the Kim family in the Park household. The juxtaposition there is key to me. The son is the very first person to attempt and fight at climbing this class hierarchy. Him going with the rock symbolizes his family's efforts, but he goes downstairs, back to supposedly make amends, but his circumstances force him to kill the others. The rock (if we take it to symbolize things being in their place) it does two main things: when it is out of place, all hell breaks loose (and it's quite literally used to try to kill people), think about this as a statement on the working-class literally beating each other up to get to the top (the top of the house). The rock is later placed back in the river, a river flows, and that is when things in the film calm down. There is a natural order to things, and when placed back, allowed to flow, things stay calm, or at the very least, the system works the way its meant to. (To me that was an allegory for capitalism) Be a part of the system, and things will work the way they are supposed to, regardless of whether they're good or bad, it is now nature. 

3. I agree with you here, I didn't really feel this went anywhere. But maybe it might hit me later, or another watch might enlighten me about this point too, who knows. 

4. This is left subtly for a reason. We're meant to think that being rich solves your problems, creates stability so to speak. Yet the status of the Park's marriage remains to be unsure and left ambiguous. It shows that money does not answer your deeper, more human questions. I think it's purposefully left ambiguous. 

5. Well, even the American Indian theme is another complex and interesting one. I'll tie it with that of the ""plan."" Remember how the mother says, we expected the boy scouts would discipline him and make him less of a free spirit? It made him more of a free spirit and obsessed with American Indians. Again, that did not go to plan. You can't control people to the degree you think you can. Additionally, think of the Cowboy-Indians dynamic and trope in general, and to me, it serves to further develop the metaphor of the class struggle the director wishes to convey. Another interpretation is how those at the top, not with bad intention oversimplify the plight of the oppressed class. The history of the Native American peoples is one that is complex, full of pain, suffering, oppression, loss of family, wealth, etc. To the Park family, it merely is reduced to a hobby for a boy. The rich or those with power constantly appropriate culture of an oppressed class, with little to no regard for how that culture came about. 

6. Man, I think you're being wayyy too logical about this. People have emotions, they write to get feelings out, they write to deal with pain as a coping mechanism. The writing of letters is very much like this. Again, you're trying to have a plan! ;) haha. 

7. Those are her allergic reactions to the peaches. It's pretty damn severe. 

8. It was to showcase the character the daughter was as a con artist. The daughter in this film if you notice is a master at reading people. If anything, it's to get you to understand her character at being able to manipulate, con, and fool people and pull it off absolutely perfectly. 

9. Quite literally shown, we need to laugh at our pain to sometimes get through it. 

10. To me, this is the most powerful part of the film in many ways. People in this film live in ""levels."" Consider how ""high"" these people live. The housekeeper's husband lives in the lowest level of the house, symbolizing the lowest level of the socio-economic ladder. I mean the guy is avoiding loan sharks, living depressed and alone in the bunker of a house. Shouting ""RESPECT,"" I interpreted that as a form of dramatic irony. Our values don't get us to succeed in life. Respect will not get you to the top of the socio-economic ladder. Respect is yelled ironically, there is no respect in ignorance. The rich are ignorant to the plight of the poor. Yelling at him is exposing him. The housekeeper's husband's entire stay in the bunker was essentially was to live and serve someone (turning the light on) who doesn't even respect what he does. Mr. Park thinks it's a motion-sensing light. He, as a wealthy man is ignorant to the plight and suffering of someone who goes out of his way to essentially serve a man. 

All in all man, these are my personal interpretations. Art is all about personal interpretation. There aren't answers or analyses that are ""correct."" But this is what I got out of the film having watched it last night. I'm sure it will only marinate and get better with time, and/or with more watches!",dps3xy

fah5632,"I'll try to answer what I can and what I guess some of the answers are (so don't trust me too much cause idk either)

1. Mr Kim probably said that because in his point of view in life, life is nothing with a plan. Because life is unpredictable- much like how he didn't imagine how cold Mr Park was to what he would refer to as the ""lower class"" and the poor.

2. That could be it. But I would hope that Kevin actually had a change of heart some point in the movie. Perhaps he wanted to offer them the stone? It was said to grant families great wealth. And the condition of the basement was way worse than his own basement house. Perhaps he felt bad for them?

4. Probably is a trophy wife. She's pretty and young, possibly much younger than him. However she lacked housekeeping skills- but why would he care since he could hire a housekeeper to do it for them? He probably just loves her for her looks.

5. I would imagine that there was no metaphor. The kid just likes American Indians. Although I could be wrong, idk.

6. It probably was to let him feel at ease for his father. He wrote about what he saw and stuff like that. Perhaps writing was a form of therapy for him to console himself about his father's absence? Like ""I will one day buy the house and see you""- stuff like that. Setting goals, thinking about the future. I don't think the letter was *for* the father specifically, more or less it was for himself. Thinking that one day maybe the father *could* read the letter gave him hope for that day to come.

8. It was the comedic plot of that scene. She just managed to tame him.

10. The basement guy respected Mr Park, as shown in the scenes previously where he chanted songs to a bunch of posters of Mr Park stuck to the wall near the switches. My guess that he just wanted to wish Mr Park his last respects. Literally. 

and the FINAL question...... Idk. Movie logic.",dps3xy
fa8na5u,"2. Guess he wanted to give them the rock to make amends. 
3. They asked for the documents to look more legitimate as a company. 
4. I think that he loved her, but was just weirded out by the questions about their marriage. 
6. Writing unsent letters is a way of getting closure, for example after a bad break up. 
7. My guess is that she went crazy after getting fired and she got drunk at a bar and messed with the wrong people perhaps? 
9. Guess the laughing is just to show that he suffered major damage to his brain.

>The Parks use the underclass for everything, oblivious to the fact that the underclass will literally kill each other to get the opportunity to serve them. 

His friend willingly gave him the tutoring job. The kick down the stairs seems accidental and the father is relieved that the housemaid isn't dead.  We're meant to think the Father's plan involves killing, but only to be revealed that his plan is to not have a plan. Only the son sees killing as the solution. 

>The Parks literally do not see or hear the underclass, they are invisible, as demonstrated by the multiple scenes in which the Kims are not discovered by the Parks despite being directly within their eyeline

But the parks also invite the son and daughter to the birthday party.  Ki-taek seem to know the driver well, listens to his advice (about the house maid company) and even gets him to join in the birthday party.  Contrast this to when the daughter is asked to stop smoking in the cyber cafe, and ignores the worker and asks her brother for a cup to use as an ashtray.  Or their recall of the driver they got fired where they could not care less about his fate.  The Kim's do not care about other people. 

>The Parks are not portrayed as clear parasites, but neither are the Kims

The Kim's latch themselves into the host family, slowly multiplying and push out the existing good relationships. And then rather being happy with what they have, their greed and gluttony and unwillingness to be compassionate about the previous maids circumstances  precipitates the destruction of the Park family and themselves. 

>Each member of the Kim family is qualified for the job they serve, and they don't steal from the Parks

There's literally a scene where they gorge themselves on all the Parks expensive whiskies and food. Not to mention that the 'art therapy' pay is clearly fraudulently obtained.  The scene where they demand details of all the Parks documents and deeds for the 'maid service' should raise a few alarm bells.

# Overlooked Importance of Ki-jung and Da-hye

Ki-jung (Jessica), from the first scene to her demise, is shown witty, cunning, crafty, thinking better than rest of the family and appealingly beautiful - old driver, Da-hye and Ki-woo stated this and I can see it pretty clearly too, that girl looks cute - . Nobody else in the family got any compliments from anyone for their behaviours and looks. As Ki-woo tells the family at the night they drank at Parks' living room, **it is almost that she belongs to the upper class.** 

   From the most trivial detail, looking fitting into the hot tub, to the most crucial skill, doing research and obtaining knowledge using the scarce resources she has and successfully acting appropriately, **she is the only one in her family with any chance to move upwards in the social pyramid. That is why she dies, serving the message of the movie mentioned above, there is no such thing as economical class mobility, poor have no way out and even the capable ones among the poor - symbollised by Ki-jung - will not make it just because their life conditions and class they belong from birth.** And mostly overlooked in the reviews, how she died is very important. I will explain that beautiful symbolism along with the importance of maid's husband, Geun-se. 

&#x200B;

 Da-Hye (Park Family's teenage girl) was introduced with the first tutoring scene. She belonged to the upper class but was missing the hallmarks for it. 

 In the house, she was constantly uncomfortable by her family's actions and seemed like they were always conflict. Also she was often overshadowed by her brother and overlooked by her parents (She claimed her brother was attention-seeking, which leads us to her deficit of attention; and Mrs. Park not even thinking about her on who will eat the food Da-song refused to eat at the rainy night makes a point). 

  She had an affair with Ki-woo (Kevin), she was never repelled by the smell of him. When she was asked if Ki-woo was different than the others, she casually expressed there was no difference from her point of view. Moreover, while her family members did not help anybody at the killing spree, even when Kim family's mother was fighting for her life against the knife wielding killer and Jessica was struggling to stay alive, she carried injured Kevin on her back to help. **Which shows us there can be understanding people amongst the upper economical class.**

#   Importance of Mad Husband, Geun-se and What Did He Symbolize? 

  He was a victim of income disparity caused by the system, rich sucking the marrow out of the poor. Yet he was showing respect to Mr. Park, every day, in his ways. **People he symbolizes are the reason this system exists and does not break. He is the real parasite for the society.** Not wanting to have a better life, content with and oblivious to the inequal situation which he directly suffers from. He is the bad guy for our modern societies. 

  This was emphasized with a couple of ideas. First, he was the reason of Kim family's despair. Hope builds for them until he is revealed and because of him, Kim family's deceit came to light. **He - and people like him - was the obstacle in front of the hope of economical class rise. Because sociologically, they keep feeding the system willingly without questioning.**

  Also he started the birthday party massacre. Death of Jessica was from Geun-se's hands, so was Kevin's injury. I said Jessica was the only one with the actual hope to make it out, earlier. This actual hope was also destroyed by Geun-se - thus his counterparts in the society -

#    Conclusion 

  Movie points out many wrong things about today's society and it is among the all time greats for me because it expresses our age and our problems realistically. It has a confident stance on its tone and slaps you right in the face by showing things you never noticed before.

  All criticism about systems and classes aside, how do we walk past poor people and be completely oblivious to their struggles? What happens when it rains, snows or when wind strengthens? Somebody out there is trying to stay alive. Somebody out here is trying to stay alive. And ideas like morality, ethics, honor gains a twisted meaning under the struggle for life. We all should notice the poor and emphatise with them. Actions on that direction will change the system for good. 

Thank you for reading",dps3xy
fhwd723,"*^(Part 2 of analysis)* 

# How that hope was built and destroyed

Movie is split in into two halves. First half is building that hope up and second part shows us how all that hope crumbles. Breaking point between the halves, climax of the hope and where it began to collapse is the night when Kim family had an interrupted celebration in the Park family's house.

Those rises and falls are symbolized by many elements in the movie, which I will explain throughly. Some key elements are : tunes underscoring and hinting the meaning of the scenes, stairs, colour palette of the scenes, the symbolic rock's placement and utilization, Kim family members's attitudes and how much Kim family members adopt their employers's house. And as one can notice, elements are related to each other.

Like I mentioned earlier, hope for a decent life was mainly symbolized by the rock. Also the rock was a symbol for the first job offer, first relation of Kim family and Park family, first glimpse of said hope. Kim family was shown hopeful before the interview of Ki-Woo with Park's. **Mother was washing the rock, it was clean and shining** which is a good symbolism for this hopeful attitude, and Ki-Woo looked good with formal clothing and combed, clean hair.  He said he will get into college next year. And Ki-taek, surprised that he had a plan. **Colour palette was different than any other we saw until that moment, yellow tinted and** ***hopeful.*** Also if I'm recalling it right, **''happy tune'' was playing**.

Park family's house is at a high point of the city, **Ki-woo climbed a slope to the house. Then he climbed the first stairs, talking to the maid, climbed a couple more stairs. That was Ki-woo feeling the hope, rising.**

After he got the job, ideal possibility of employing her sister too was making him happy, not only because it was a witty idea, it was serving that hope subconsciously. **Colours were yellow, sun was bright and same happy tune started to play. This apparently is a motif for hope exposition throughout the movie.**

After they were all employed by Park family, Park boy Da-song figured they were smelling the same. **This was the smell of their class, though they are all employed and rejoiced, they could never be same as rich.** Later on they were having a steak-feast in their half basement. The drunk pissing guy who Min (Ki-woo's friend) warded off with a confident shout, was there again. Contrary to the earlier scene, this time **Ki-woo (Kevin) had the courage. He took the stone to fight the drunk guy. That was symbolism.** Their hopes, metaphorically the rock, gave them confidence. **But here is the real symbolism** which shouldn't be missed under the shadow of the apparent first one : **His attempt to ward the guy off was not as successful as Min's. Guy directed his pissing to Ki-woo instead of being scared off. Even they have the hope for a decent life, again, they could never be same as rich.**

At the breaking point, the night when Kim family got drunk and talked about their lives before they were interrupted by old maid and Park family, scene is well set. Kim family is clearly expositioning their risen hopes for a better life. Father says ''We look cool''. Ki-woo (Kevin) was hoping to marry Da-hye (the girl he tutored). Mother and father cracked jokes about it but did not show disagreement. They also suggested Ki-jung (Jessica) should start a relationship with the handsome old driver of Benz. Father implied they own the house by saying they are comfortably eating and drinking at their living room. Nobody seemed to disagree. 

When maid showed up and after she got in, revealed the secret of her husband, mother of Kim family insulted her. Mother thought she and her family belong to a higher class now. **Then their hopes** ***fell down the stairs*** **as hiding Kim family members tumbled their way into the maid's sight.** While patronizing the maid seconds ago, they quickly realized they belong to the same class.

After Kim family members escape the Park residence, they are going down just like their hope. Stair after stair, back into the flooded district. Symbollic rock is shown floating in the sewer water that flooded Kim family's house. It is dirty and Ki-woo takes a moment to look at it in dissapointment, underscoring the importance of it.

Day after the flood, Ki-woo is shown holding on to the rock. His father questions him by asking why is he still holding it. Father lost the hope. He does not have a plan as he explained. Contrary to the scene where it all started, his son was going to the interview with Park family, where they had a plan. Rock was clean that day. Ki-woo says ''I cannot let it go.'' . Though it is dirty and in bad shape, he still got that hope while family's condition is worse than ever. 

At the birthday party of Da-song (Park boy), I think Ki-woo decides to kill the basement dweller couple. This shows his swollen hatred and desire to take a full-blown downfall. Then he gets crushed by the rock. **Hope they built and lived happily with eventually done them harm. Because it - hope for a better life - never belong to them. Upward class mobility is not possible. Poor will never be rich. That is the movie's realistic, uneasy and crystal clear message which I and movie stated many times.**

Family is destroyed afterwards. Girl dying, which is a very important event for symbollic purposes which I will explain later on, Ki-woo brain damaged, father (possibly) hiding in the basement thus living worse than ever and mother, forced to live with her son in more poverty than ever, just like her husband. 

Ki-woo is shown placing the rock on a riverbed where it's colour and shape fits right in. **That means rock never belonged to them and now, it is in the right place. Kim family's most hopeful person abandoned it after all.** For the ending, Ki-woo dreams a presumably impossible scenario and camera cuts back into their half basement. This ending was referenced as a ''surefire kill'' by the director, **showing no hope after all, a snowy winter day outside and life, harsher as always for the imprisoned lower class. That is how the hope for a comfortable and a more decent life is completely crumbled, destroyed.**",dps3xy

**The Kims** find themselves needing to cheat because they can't afford to do anything through legitimate means.

And Mr. Park makes it clear to Mr. Kim that he'll never let him ""cross the line"" into becoming friends, meaning that he will only accept Mr. Kim as an employee that he can boss around, paying him to appear at the birthday party instead of inviting him kindly, and would fire without a second thought.  And then there's **the basement couple,** who may be the most victimized, because Moon-gwang is left to remain as the housekeeper after her original boss (the house's designer) passed away; and Geun-se, who couldn't break into the job market and was forced to try running a bakery franchise, but ran into bad luck when the bakery trend went bust.

The next day the rich mother remarks how ""The rain was wonderful and made the day so pretty today.""

Same thing in the scene at the end. The rich family's son has a seizure. Sure it's serious, but meanwhile Kim Ji-yeong is literally dying on the grass having been stabbed by the crazed vengeance seeking man from the basement. And all the Park's are shouting is ""GIVE ME THE KEYS WE HAVE TO GET HIM TO THE HOSPITAL!""

Add the way that the Parks spoke about the Kims, about their smell and how Mr. Park didn’t want Mr. Kim to “cross the line” (meaning, into friendship and, thus, gaining access to his circle of upper class friends), about how poor people must be drug-addicted prostitutes...

fhv8z20,">Mr. Kim realizes that after the flood that forces them into a crowded gym for shelter, but by that point he's lost his soul, his conscience, and ultimately falls on a predatory instinct to attack his host.

I had a different reading of that scene: what happens is not a predatory instinct, but an outburst of repressed rage.

Throughout the movie we often see Mr. Kim closing his eyes in what resemble a meditative state, a method of self-control. As Mr. Park said, he is always about to ""cross the line"" but manages to do so.

When Mr. Park shows an incredible lack of awareness by ordering Kim to drive him the hospital, while Kim is desperately trying to stop the bleeding of his daughter (of course Park didn't know she was his daughter, but he could still see Kim was trying to help a dying girl), Kim is confused and shocked: he started seeing Park as a friend, how could he ignore his obvious shock and pain? Even so, Kim tosses him the keys to the car.

But then Park rolls over the body of the assaulter and in disgust taps his nose before approaching: the smell of the poor is something he can't stand, even when he should be worried to save his son's life. The same smell possessed by Kim, which Park openly stated to be disgusted by, unaware Kim was listening.

And so Kim loses it: all his life he was looked as a cockroach, a smelly, disgusting parasite. Without thinking he assaults Park, letting go all the contained rage and finally crossing that line.

We are shown he almost immediately regrets what he has done, crying and begging for forgiveness in front of Park's photo. He knows that what he did is wrong, but his philosophy of never having a plan and just doing what feels natural doomed him.",dps3xy
fhs21mn,"I think you missed the mark a bit in your assessment. The Kims are easy choices as parasites for the reasons you suggested, however if we truly consider the characters, it is the Parks who are nourishing themselves at the expense of the poor. The fact that they may not realize it doesn't change the fact. In nature, parasites consume nutrients from a host unaware of the repercussions, not for pleasure, but for survival.

&#x200B;

However, having said all that, I think in the film as well as the real world, the lines are often blurred between good and bad.

f6hp6jf,"I feel it to be a bit of a stretch. First of all, I believe the main theme of the film is how capitalism divides people by their wealth and force them into a crash course.

But North Korean people usually face problems of a much different nature because their worship of Kim Jung Eun, which can be seen as a cult of personality for example, has very little to do with the inherent problems of capitalistic society.

As such, I'm afraid introducing such a perspective would have only muddled the subject matter of the film.

Besides, South Koreans normally regard such a practice of their northern brethren as something bizzare, if not outright repulsive (which can be seen in the scene where the manner N. Korean announcers speak is ridiculed by the former housemaid).

> Kim Ki-woo's relationship with the rock, especially with regards to how he uses it as a weapon and why he leaves it in the river. Not sure at all what to make of this.

Ki-woo is the schemer of the Kims (always making plans), but he also is the most naive, which pretty clearly seems to be a deliberate decision. I think him attributing a lot of symbolism and meaning to things is supposed to come across as a teenager who thinks he's wiser than he really is (e.g. ""it's all so metaphorical!""). so he's effectively superstitious and shit, thinking the rock really is a gift that will bring prosperity to the family. Even after everything has gone to shit, he dreams that the rock floats up to him and won't let go of him, when in reality he can't let go of his family's get rich quick dream. Him going down to the basement with the rock is a continuation of the delusion that this rock is a gift from destiny, fating him towards good fortunes. If I wield this lucky charm as a weapon, surely I can clean everything up, and we'll be back to business, right?

In light of this, I'm not sure what to think of him releasing the rock in the river. It seems contrary to the rest of the movie's ending, where Ki-woo doesn't seem to have learned his lesson, and continues to dream and plan in vain for material prosperity. actually, this just makes the ending more depressing to me. Ki-woo can grow up and realize that the rock is just a fucking rock, but he's still poor as fuck, separated from his father, and he still can't help but dream of a better life.

> The way the entrance to the basement is lit, how it's an almost pitch-black abyss that people disappear into. Assuming that's something to do with the inescapability of poverty, but I'm not sure if there's more to it.

I'd say it has more to do with the invisibility of poverty to the rich. What lies below the house is a black hole to the residents, the poor bastard who climbs out of it is a fucking ghost.

> The lightning that appeared while Kim Ki-jeong was talking on the couch. My first thought was that this could be an allegory to Frankenstein, showing that the taste of wealth is turning her into a monster. But I'm not sure if that's a reach.

I forgot about this! I think you're close, it's not that Ki-jeong became a monster, but the lightning highlights the only unequivocal sin (within what I think is the movie's stance): pushing others down for your own gain. This is when she berates her dad for daring to be concerned about the driver he replaced. Ki-woo and Ki-jeong getting employed by the Parks really doesn't hurt anybody, but the Kims crossed the line by getting the driver fired, and they REALLY crossed the line (to their own eventual destruction) by getting the housemaid fired.",dps3xy
f6s4fq1,"There's also a link between the scene with the drunk man urinating near the Kim family window (another parasite) being watered in slow motion and the Kims fleeing under the heavy rain.

Parasites in the movie: the bug and the drunk man (and the rock?) to the Kims, the Kims and the man in the basement to the Parks... makes me wonder if the director also wanted to depict the Parks as parasites to society.",dps3xy
f6vsuk2,"The fumigation scene I took it literally as free fumigation of their home because they know there's a lot of bugs. What they don't realize is that they are bugs of society themselves and are choking and in pain from a society that's trying to flush them out of their home. Maybe the fumigation is a forshadowing of their family literally being flushed out from the flooding coming in from the same window later in the movie.

The scene with her sitting on the toilet I think makes a little more sense if you remember the scenes cut though it. I just came from watching it again and now I clearly remember this scene. Right before she sits on the toilet to take a drag, the scene before shows the former maid look at the toilet and puke into it. The very next scene is a close up of the toilet exploding. I take it as, the former maid and husband are in a shithole basement, but they still live higher than the semi basement poor family, and all the shit flows downward.
There are other scenes juxtapositioning the lives of each class, the rich family quarreling over ram-don and the rich wife picking out clothes for her sons party immediately before the scene where the displaced families are tossed donated clothes from the gym refuge center. I think the scene with her sitting on the toilet signifies that at the end of the day, the Kim family is fucked and they are literally neck deep in shit.

The small raft I'm not sure but what I felt was utter hopelessness. There's nowhere to go and they tried to salvage their valuables, which is shown visually to not be much. All is lost but somehow they trudge on, barely staying afloat.

Ki-woo's relationship with the rock I thought of as his representation of personal vigor. Throughout the movie he truly believed he's able to crawl out of absolute poverty and the rock symbolizes his hunger to live a better life. He attempts to use it as a weapon, but falls into the wrong hands to a person who has even more vigor.  I took the representation of him putting the rock to rest in the water as him accepting that he will never be able to crawl out of poverty.

I don't know about the lightning, but I found what she said a very metaphorical saying of life these days. The dad and son we're talking about if the driver is doing okay and they hope he is, but then she comes in and says, who cares about him, care about us, we matter more!  I find it as a reflection of how selfish we have become as a society. It's not that we're evil and want to harm others. It's a feeling of insecurity and danger justifying us to only care about ourselves and who cares how many people we hurt and damage along our path.

fiwwmz2,"She clapped just once, but yeah, there’s a few things about that shot...

Mrs. Park napping in the yard suggests that she’s just bored and napping after her afternoon tea (most likely, IMO) or that she’s a little drunk (less likely) or strung out and high (least likely).  She’s also shown to be fairly useless for running the household, and that the maid manages most of the daily activity.  “Simple,” yes, perhaps.

It also shows how safe and private their yard is.  By contrast, the sidewalk outside the Kims’ apartment gets sprayed for bugs and has drunks trying to urinate on their building.  Money buys security for the Park family.

Also, the composition of that shot places a line between the working class — Ki-woo and the maid — and Mrs. Park.  There’s a seam between the window panes, and when the maid reaches to clap at Mrs. Park, she crosses the line that it makes, and then she immediately retreats back to her side.  This is the first symbolic depiction of the line separating the poor and rich classes. [https://youtu.be/ezwSfT7sXO0?t=377](https://youtu.be/ezwSfT7sXO0?t=377)

Oh, one more thing that I thought about while on my morning walk: both she and the housekeeper are dressed very well for just hanging out at home (more importantly, although you'd expect the housekeeper to always appear professional, it's notable that Mrs. Park also looks dressed up).  I think you can categorize the wardrobe styles of the rich into three basic categories -- extra-normal-casual, business-like, and just-rolled-outta-bed.  The last was exemplified by Awkwafina's character in *Crazy Rich Asians* \-- it's like being rich enough that you can live in Manhattan and walk out your building's front door, still wearing your pajamas, to shop at Tiffany.  But being dressed fashionably and almost office-ready, like Mrs. Park was, is a different mentality that I'm barely able to grasp.  I wonder if she's feeling pressured to always appear perfectly put-together, which would bolster her character of being a mere trophy wife (which, if we're honest about it, is not that different from being a household decoration).",dps3xy

I felt that he was planning to kill them, thinking that they were both still tied up and would be easy targets; but he got caught off guard by Moon-gwang laying on the floor out of place, and Geun-se took the opportunity to attack.

Recall the Kim father's monologue in the gym about making plans. It's an entire moment about how for people like them, the only plan worth making is none, because planning is a luxury for people with resources. The movie ends with the son making a plan.

At previous scenes about the smell, the father was not watching Mr. Park caring only about his son holding his nose from the smells with disgusted face while helplessly seeing both of his children at risk of death, his daughter stabbed and his son covered with blood.

Mrs. Kim's shame about her son's possible mental illness makes her susceptible to manipulation, ""shameful secrets"" are used as weapons throughout, and shame is what ultimately breaks Mr. Kim.

He's straightforward about his message. The poor fight for scraps that the oblivious rich don't even notice leaving. It's called Parasite because in this case, the poor people are parasites latching onto this house and any rich family that happens to live in it.

He revealed himself purely by accident, and that's all.  Our impression of him, from earlier scenes, is about pity, not fear.

But that timing, which made us realize that Da-song *has already known about him for at least full year,* adds a lot of tension:  Will his parents ever take him seriously about the mystery man?  He already noticed that the Kims smell the same, so are they going to be exposed?

First there is the scene where they feel guilt over the driver being fired, but justify their move because surely he has found another job. Then the housekeeper eventually ends with one of them dying and one being locked in a basement for the rest of his life. The Kims are not perfect figures of morality, they're realistic characters. And they pay the price for their selfish deeds.

They aren’t “cheating the system,” but instead are *perpetuating* the system that keeps the Kims in the basement.  Mr. Park comes right out and says that he won’t let Mr. Kim “cross the line” from paid servant to being a friend and peer. 

[late edit: imagine how different the tone of the party would've been if, as they were hiding in the bushes, Mr. Park told Mr. Kim, ""I know this isn't in your job description, but help me be a better dad, so let's do this just for fun.  And welcome to the family.""  Ten bucks says that's how Hollywood would have written the ending /]

""Jessica"" is bleeding out, dying, and no one cares about her, they care about their shitty son who fainted. In a sense, the end of the film is the ""mask off"" moment when the rich family is revealed to be heartless and even evil - they have no social conscience and when the servants are murdered, they immediately think about how that will affect their son, about their feelings etc.

This film is actually very subtle. It's about how simple indignities are what people cannot handle - poverty is one thing, being treated like you're a toxin because you're poor is usually ""crossing the line"", to use Mr. Park's words. Mr. Kim stabs him in a fit of fury because *Mr. Park does not give a shit about him*. His daughter is bleeding out, his house was flooded, Mr. Park doesn't care, Mr. Park reveals this by sniffing with profound disgust at the keys of the car, something Mr. Kim has no control over.

You’re right, they screw over other working class people but that is because they have no other way to get jobs.  That says more about how the system is stacked against working class and poor people than anything else.  You say the first thing they do when the Parks leave is get drunk and break things. Guess what, people get drunk on their days off.  Even Mrs. Park sells the impromptu party to her friend by saying “hey we can get drunk during the day”.  They have no plan to do anything to the Parks other than keep working for them.  How could they know there was a guy living in a bunker and everything would go to shit?  What does Mrs. Park do to deserve her station?  She has no skills of any sort.  She can’t even load a dishwasher and can’t manage her own children, or push her own grocery cart, but she lives in the lap of luxury.

We still very clearly understand how miserable the lives of the poor can be to the point where they’re neck-deep in their town’s sewage. We also know from sociological research that poverty and inequality can be very detrimental to people’s mental health. If anyone ever says poor people have worse morals, are more violent or even more dumb, we need to emphasize that all of these things are proven results of poverty that can themselves inflict more harm on the people’s situations in cycles of abuse.

Money 'irons out the wrinkles' or whatever her exact words were.

The Kims have to con, hustle, and grift just to get ANY job, let alone a good job. Poverty is not ennobling, I think the director's point is that it has a warping effect on those who live in it, the same way wealth made the Parks callous and a bit self-centered (but not necessarily bad people).

Bong has called this his staircase movie vs snow piercers hall way movie. Almost anytime we transition between the two residents we see people walking up hill/up stairs to the Park residence or down hill to their small apartment. When the giant rainstorm comes it is a problem for the parks, it forces them to cancel their camping trip. The consequences for the poorest members of the community are a thousand times worse than the rich problems though. In a movie about class this is perhaps the most blatant example of privilege.

Twists and turns that make sense and surprise you, 

Emotionally charged, human and real

I don't have a personal opinion on class division and who, of rich or poor, deserves a better spot in society but I don't think this film was really trying to drive an opinion on it either. This is just magnificent storytelling. You're going to walk away with your own set of feelings on the matter, of course. But what stands out to me about this film more than others is the illustration of two starkly different worlds and family dynamics, and how it allows the viewer to interact with them both meaningfully.",dps3xy
fde1la6,"There are a lot of aspects to it, but pick just one thing -- like how it appears that the Kims are ascending the social ladder -- and follow its progress through the film.

For example, early on, the Kims are begging the pizza shop manager to not cut their pay too badly; then later, they're eating at the same shop, and the same manager has to serve them their food.

Or Mr. Kim's bubbling resentment stays quiet as he folds pizza boxes in a cloud of pesticides, to snapping at his wife and almost hitting her, to finally lashing out and stabbing Mr. Park.

Or how the almost comical way that the Kims replace the Parks' household staff turns dark when we see the original housekeeper looking emotionally crushed as she walked away from the house.

(adding on to the last point) Notice how each successive step of the Kims taking over is more outrageous than the one before, from a friendly recommendation (Ki-woo as English tutor), to a friend of the family (""Jessica from Illinois""), to planting a rumor of misbehavior (Ki-taek taking over as the driver), to fraudulent accusations and personal injury (framing Moon-gwang with TB and triggering her peach allergy).  We're gradually walked through each instance, getting accustomed to basic fraud, giggling about how some peach fuzz makes the old housekeeper start coughing uncontrollably, until we're forced to confront our own feelings when we see how desperate she was to get back into the house.",dps3xy

She looks so desperate and you don't know what will happen if you do not let her in. The mom might have felt a little sorry basically because they kicked her out.

The former housekeeper INTENTIONALLY did not call the Parks. What if Ms. Park doesn't want her in while she is not there? What if Ms. Park tells Choong-sook not to let anybody in? Remember that she was in touch with Da-song, and came back that night because he told her they were going to be out. She came to the house to ask the new housekeeper to take care of her husband. She doesn't want the Parks to be aware of the existence of the bunker. She wanted to come to the house when only new housekeeper was present without Park family.",dps3xy

fb2r2kf,"I can answer some of these question, courtesy of some Korean blogs that I found through search which covered it in detail.  In short, all street locations are several different actual places in Seoul, except for the Kim’s home area.

1) Seongbuk-dong, Seoul.  IIRC it’s famous as an affluent area but ironically there’s also a shanty town nearby as well.

2) While that whole street block is entirely a set (more on that later), the convenience store and “stairs” area (where Ki Woo stares at his drenched sneakers) is Bukahyeon-dong, Seoul.  This I personally know as I used to have an Aunt living in the area back in the 80’s.  Very hilly, and one of the old shanty towns in heart of the city... from what I hear much of it is being redeveloped nowadays though.  Bit of a shame as I feel the area has so much character.  Interesting tidbit: that convenience store where Ki Woo and Min Hyeok drink in the beginning of the movie, and where Kijeong steals a peach, is an actual convenience store that has been there for over 40 years.  As a matter of fact, I recall shopping for ice cream there when I was a kid whenever I went over to my Aunt’s place.

3) That whole sequence takes place in following order: Seongbuk-dong (Hill of Park’s home area) -> Jaha-Mun Tunnel (the tunnel area, of course) -> Huam-dong (I believe this is the pan-out scene you speak of)  -> Changsin-dong -> BukAhyeon-dong (The stairs area as Ive mentioned).  

The homes themselves, of course, are all sets and not actual locations.  And the whole street block where Kim’s live, due to having to do the flood scene later in the movie, is also entirely a set they built at a water park.

Mr Park is almost never in a shot with his family and when he and his wife fool around it's facing away from each other, feeling each other with clothes completely on. When Kim asks Park, ""you love your wife"" he's crossing the line because it's the one thing Park doesn't have on Earth and his status probably won't afford him - affection. Maybe because he was raised with distant parents, with nannies and tutors, like his kids are experiencing, maybe he doesn't know what loving one's wife even looks like.

fhx0hhl,"The point of the movie is that it's not the people, it's the societal structure. Neither the Parks or the Kims were naturally predisposed to act a certain way. The Kim father had no violent disposition, and the Parks had no malevolent disposition even though their lifestyle was maintained through the labor of others. That's the point made by the fact that the Parks were not intentionally malicious, also that you don't have to be intentionally malicious to exploit other people. You can be a nice person and still live off the service of others. The movie is saying the structure has made this possible, and it's not okay.    


As for the smell thing, it's a metaphor. The Kims can keep pretending all they want, but the stench of their real lives will always cling to them. It's not even something they ever noticed until rich people who breathe clean air smelled it. There's also the fact that the Parks were so concerned with smell while the Kims will never escape the conditions of life that are causing them to carry a stench.

fi25mti,"It's more of the little things that happen with the parks; they live off the help of those who are less fortunate but at the same time fetishize poverty (the sex scene- where they're roleplaying being the driver and a drugged-up woman) we also see Mrs. Park take money out of the original paycheck given to Ki-woo while also telling him that ""she was going to pay him the same rate as Min-hyuk but added more due to inflation."" They're also willing to insult Ki-taek behind his back talking about the ""smell"" that comes from him.

The rich do not care about the people they have working for them and it's shown very clearly in the garden party scene; all of the guests including the parks run; they don't stop to try and help Ki-jeong after being stabbed or help Chung-sook while she is fighting  Geun-sae.

fi2sosk,"People already dug into the societal structure metaphors but there's other more direct things you missed.

They fire older help without even investigating what's going on or even being truthful. In one scene, they say ""We won't stoop to their level"" as if being honest and discussing possibly gross things to a lower class citizen is ""stooping.""

They don't care about the daughter, as she is pretty much ignored. The mother also literally says early on that they never cared about the grades, as if it doesn't matter. She says this directly to the boy who is supposed to tutor her - the boy who can't go to college despite his supposed knowledge.

The Park father describes the Kim father's smell as that of someone who rides the subway, saying it crosses the line of being unbearable. This is both metaphorical and explicit.

When people are hurt towards the end, all of the rich people run away (except for one random person) and only care about saving the boy. This, if observed in a couple of seconds, might seem fine.

f7i4xm3,">Kevin's relationship with Min and Da-hye. He betrays his friend, whom he seems to genuinely respect. It's unclear whether he actually likes Da-hye or is just manipulating her for his benefit. We never see her reaction to discovering the truth, or Min's.

He is indeed manipulating her because he likes her wealth. Her being a nice girl is something he appreciates, but he really wants the money and power she represents more than anything. Just look at him reading through her diary. Min might also be someone he respects, but it's pretty clear that it's not a deep friendship between them. Min sees Ki-taek as someone less likely to attract Da-hye than his college friends due to his economic situation. That he wouldn't dream of going above his station. Ki-taek meanwhile resents that his friend is rich and doing everything he wants to do. Study abroad, go to college. That sort of thing.

>The dad getting so upset about Mr Park judging his smell, seems very out of place. Lying under the table, he seems so genuinely hurt by these remarks, as if he cares what this aristocrat he's been conning thinks of him. Then he murders Park after he shows disgust at the smell of Geun-sae (Park just wants to save his son who we know has 15 minutes to live, and he doesn't know that Ki-jeong is his daugther)

Ki-taek hides his resentment very well but from the beginning of the movie, he's clearly simmering with how much he hates his position. The mistake with the pizza boxes was him because he hated that he couldn't provide for his family and was reduced to leaching fumigation. As he connects to Mr. Park, he tries to reach out on a personal level only to be rebuffed because his employer wants to keep things professional. A big part of the movie also is that the poor idolize the rich. Of course he's hurt. A man he respects for being so rich and able to provide for his loved ones looks down on him. There's also an unspoken background for Ki-taek which makes it clear to me that he used to have a good background, even if he wasn't really rich. The Scholar stone for example. That is a bit of old fashioned gift no one really does in Korea. The younger generation sees it as just a pretty rock but Ki-taek is knowledgeable enough to recognize the type of rock. Something only scholars and the wealthy would have known back then. Ki-woo also wasn't lying about being a Boy Scout as a kid, as Ki-taek points out in his letter. Being a boy scout is something only people with time and money to spare in Korea would have done. A poor family sends Ki-taek for Scouting? Never ever.

>Geun-sae's worship of Mr. Park felt kind of strange and unjustified. But I guess he's just gone kooky living in that bunker.

3 years of almost complete solitude, where he's entirely reliant on the unknown goodwill of Mr. Park and his wife? Yeah he's unhinged.

>Kevin's whole character arc. 90% of the movie he's just manipulative and cunning, then he suddenly cares about fitting in, and then decides to murder Geun-sae? Then he has a dream to get rich? There's some theming about the ruthlessness and futility of the rags-to-riches dream, but it felt really muddled

His manipulation was to get himself rich and fit in with the wealthy, but after the events of the rain and seeing the garden party, he realized how little he fit in and how much he'd fucked up by getting greedy and having his entire family hired. His going to murder them was his attempt at a clean break and get everything started from scratch.

>The whole ending, the dad is in the basement now, but why? Sure, the police are after him, but he could sneak out for a night and visit his family or at least give them a note. I get it symbolically, there's always a poor person suffering beneath the foundations of the rich, but it really doesn't make sense for him to stay there longer than a few weeks maybe.

Korea is a smaller country with a much higher CCTV presence and lower murder rate than America (which I assume you are). Meeting his son is totally unrealistic.

>Why does Geun-sae stab Ki-jeon? I get that he's in a frenzy, but why her specifically? Maybe I missed something, but it seemed odd that he went directly for her.

She's the first person he sees. The son is dead to his knowledge. The dad is hiding behind the bushes. The mom is elsewhere in the garden party. Ki-jeon meanwhile is the center of attention and bringing out a cake.

>Kevin's brain damage. What was the significance?

No clue.

>Da-song knows morse code and is shown attempting to decode Geon-sae's messages, but this goes nowhere

Because it shows that Da-song is ignored. He's just a kid. Or perhaps he just thinks it's the ghost messaging him, or heck, he just got bored and stopped translating. On another level, it might represent how while the poor cry for help and maybe are even seen by others, it goes ignored by society.",dps3xy
f7ft86o,"I'll take a crack at these. I might be wrong, but Bong is critical of capitalism so I watched the movie from that point of view. 


> Kevin's relationship with Min and Da-hye. He betrays his friend, whom he seems to genuinely respect. It's unclear whether he actually likes Da-hye or is just manipulating her for his benefit. We never see her reaction to discovering the truth, or Min's.


I don't think he went in with the intention to betray his friend, but once he saw how much power he was gaining over over the Parks, he realized he could eventually live in that house instead of just tutoring there. I don't think he liked her, he just became corrupted by the luxery he was starting to live and never wanted to lose it. 



>The dad getting so upset about Mr Park judging his smell, seems very out of place. Lying under the table, he seems so genuinely hurt by these remarks, as if he cares what this aristocrat he's been conning thinks of him. Then he murders Park after he shows disgust at the smell of Geun-sae (Park just wants to save his son who we know has 15 minutes to live, and he doesn't know that Ki-jeong is his daugther)


The dad was a proud man. He was very insulted that his pizza boxes were critizised as not perfect at the beginning of the movie. The fact that Mr. Park was disgusted by the smell of a dead body so much and even took the time to cover his nose when lives were on the line finally did him in. Especially after he saw how barely-inconvenced the Parks were by the rain compared to his neighborhood: this rich family was able to plan a lavish party for their child while homes were being destroyed elsewhere. 



> Geun-sae's worship of Mr. Park felt kind of strange and unjustified. But I guess he's just gone kooky living in that bunker.


I took this as a representation of the worship a lot of poor people have the extremely wealthy. Not only do a lot look up to them, they defend them. Geun-sae turning on the lights is the best example of this. Mr. Park is so priveleged that he automatically assumes the lights turn on for him. A lot of people walk through life, being handed things, and assume that those things just happen. But those things are actually happening because the class below them does it for them, and they do it willingly and without complaint.



> Kevin's whole character arc. 90% of the movie he's just manipulative and cunning, then he suddenly cares about fitting in, and then decides to murder Geun-sae? Then he has a dream to get rich? There's some theming about the ruthlessness and futility of the rags-to-riches dream, but it felt really muddled.

I don't think he wanted to murder Geun-sae. I think he was bringing the rock as a gift of good fortune for them. A foolish gesture, but it mirrors his rich friend bringing Kevin's family the rock earlier. Both times, the higher class person thinks a rock as a gift will bring the recipients luck but it does the opposite. Mere gestures aren't actually enough to change the systems that made these people poor. 



>The whole ending, the dad is in the basement now, but why? Sure, the police are after him, but he could sneak out for a night and visit his family or at least give them a note. I get it symbolically, there's always a poor person suffering beneath the foundations of the rich, but it really doesn't make sense for him to stay there longer than a few weeks maybe.

Where would he go though? 



> Why does Geun-sae stab Ki-jeon? I get that he's in a frenzy, but why her specifically? Maybe I missed something, but it seemed odd that he went directly for her.


I think he just went for the first person form that family he could find. Plus he believed he already killed Kevin. 


> Kevin's brain damage. What was the significance?


Not sure about that one, I need to think on it more. 


>Da-song knows morse code and is shown attempting to decode Geon-sae's messages, but this goes nowhere


Communication is actually a very prominent theme in this movie. At the beginning the family has to sit on their toilet to even get a text about a possible job. Geon-sae can only communicate by banging his head on bottoms. The Parks on the other hand, buy things like walkie talkies as toys. Morse code was just a fun puzzle for the kid. Communication was a toy to the rich while it was a matter of life and death for the poor.",dps3xy
f7fmvw4,Kevin did not bring the rock downstairs to murder anyone.  He considered it a spiritual rock that would make things better.,dps3xy
f7ftbj0,"I disagree a bit

1. Its probably a set up to show how morally gray it all is, the Parks aren't necessarily evil, and neither are the Kim's. 

2. Its because he does care about what he thinks. Mr. Parks comments also show how he looks down on Mr. Kim and others not as economically secure. Another nail in the coffin was the way no one stood to help his wife or his daughter as they were fighting for their lives, even if Mr. Park did know, how would you feel knowing your employer doesn't value your life enough to even help you at your most vulnerable?

3. Dudes def lost his mind. four years of near complete isolation tend to do that, i guess as a coping mechanism he started venerating Mr. Park as a god, a provider.

4. to me it seems he decides to kill Geun-sae to protect the scam I guess as a way to take responsibility for starting the family down this path. I think his lamenting about fitting in has to do with the rain storm the night before, everything he has is gone and now he really sees just how out of place he actually.

5. CCTV are all around the wealthy neighborhood, if he were to leave he would most definitely be found at some point.

6. She was the first one he saw. Ki-taek was behind the bushes and Mrs Kim was off to the side. Ki-jeong was in the center of attention and the easiest member of the Kim's to attack first

7. i cant say lol

8. Its shown that Da-song is never taken seriously or listened too by basically everyone in the household. if he told his parents he would've been ignored anyway. someone else in this thread mentioned how while morse code was a tool for the basement dweller it was only a game for Da-song",dps3xy

Anyway, I don't think the primary strength of the film is in conveying subtle social messages. I think it's great because it's super tight story and very well-made. There's not a single wasted moment or shot in the movie. The pacing is perfect. The story goes in an unexpected direction and for the whole second half of the film the audience is watching with rapt excitement, wondering what could possibly happen next. I think all kinds of moviegoers like this kind of movie. Nobody is too much of a ""simpleton"" to enjoy it. Even if you completely missed the social commentary, it's still incredibly entertaining.

Again, not saying it's a bad film. The plot twist caught me off guard in a good way, and certain visuals stick even after the credits roll. But on the whole, it does seem overhyped.

If anything, he's a director that spoon-feeds you, and makes his intent felt heavily with each cut/transition. There's no hidden message here - it's written the wall. (Kevin repeats the line ""It's so symbolic"" 3 or 4 times in the movie - this is Bong  poking fun at himself for how obvious he's making all the symbolism in the movie)

The film had multiple genre hits and all of those done well. It was a good multidimensional story with several arcs that was put together in a way that didnt do a disservice to any of the characters. A good story, well acted, and filmed well. This is why people liked it. 

Compare it to almost any recent release and you'll see flaws in any of these aspects that detract from the overall. Forget symbolism or social commentary and compare it narratively and cinematically. Ad to this the fact that its a foreign language film (something that largely turns off American audiences) and this film overcomes all of those obstacles. 

I'm not saying its the best film of the decade, because personally thats all subjective, but I enjoyed it as much as the few other films I've seen this year that were my favorite. Those movies being : Middsommar, Peanut Butter Falcon, The Farewell, and Can You Ever Forgive Me?

f6deooc,"I don’t think the film necessarily works well because it’s themes are subtle, but rather it tells pretty them broadly in a very tight screenplay whilst expanding, and thusly enhancing, on them with its choices in the actual production which are more “subtle” I guess you could say.

Parasite is also not an indie film. It’s the latest film from what many consider a modern auteur with a popular cast so from that there is already the expectation the film will be of a certain level of quality. I think also Bong Jong-ho’s talents and history of directing both successful low-budget films and blockbusters plays a role in the overall “like-ability” of the film. One aspect is how Bong is able to seamlessly incorporate multiple genres (which if you look at Bollywood or even Marvel movies is shown to be a general crowd pleasing element) which works successfully but differently for different crowds. For critics, the genre hopping could be seen as stroke of masterful writing with its foreshadowing or whatever while for a more general film going audience it’s just simply entertaining.

As for me, I really liked the movie but I agree that I feel my expectations weren’t met. As a said earlier, the movie isn’t necessarily subtle so many of the story beats and twists—while well done—weren’t as crazy as expected. I feel as though the whole marketing campaign of “expect the unexpected” ruined that for me as it made me feel things were going to go crazier than they did.

And just to touch on the film of year/decade point a little bit, acclaims like this happen every year pretty much. A lot of movies come out every year, but how many new releases does the average person see? Typically not a whole lot so they’ll probably latch on to the best they have personally seen. Parasite succeeds in being that film for a lot of people since it’s generally just a very well done movie with relevant themes and is most importantly very accessible to watch versus something like Burning which touches on similar themes.",dps3xy

The poor father broke when the rich father brushed off the dying daughter, and was more worried about his son who was not quite in dire danger.

f6060f8,"Funny enough, I get what you mean. 
Upon first viewing, I felt let down. 
BUT I realised it’s because I was hoping that Bong Joon Ho would go back to his pre snowpiercer days. His style sort of shifted from snowpiercer on and it continued with Okja. I always thought it’s because of the fact that he was starting to bring in a little bit of Hollywood and western influences into his film. 

When I heard he was going back to making a full on Korean film with the likes of Kang song Ho as part of his cast, I was very optimistic. Memories of murder and the host are really two of my favourite Korean films ever. I thought he’d go back to that style. 

But it seems like this new style he’s had since snowpiercer stuck around for parasite. The feels of his films genuinely shifted. 

I’ve always admired Bong’s sense of blocking and framing where his directing is concerned and I felt like it was almost a style choice that was attached to him (think wes Anderson and colour palettes/symmetry) but his recent films don’t display this distinct “characteristic” I’ve come to expect from his films.
Don’t get me wrong, he’s still pushing out great films, but I miss the old bong Joon Ho. I genuinely feel like there has been a shift in the films where we can split it to pre and post snowpiercer.

One of the main ones is that the rich people were the good people and the poor people were the bad people. We see the poor father be a con man and to teach his son the wrong way of living, so at the end he vindicates himself by communicating to his son how to be reunited with him, and it is to buy the house he is going to self imprison himself in. He tells him what he has to do and it is a lifetime of hardwork, not conning people. The kid doesn't do all of those things, he imagines all the hardwork he is going to have to put in to save his father's life or be reuinited, therefore redeeming the father. Redeeming the father in the sense that he recorrected the bad parenting that cost his daughter her life. 

It has been awhile since I have seen it. But you have to think about the rich and poor dichotomy being presented. It has a ton of symbolism, so if you don't pick up on what things represent early, much of the third act just seems absurd and the message is failed to be delivered.

Ki-woo (Son): Betrays his good friend, kisses underage girl, starts this whole mess, and (possibly) contemplates killing the people in the basement. His punishment is getting choked and smashed with the rock, mental illness, probation, loss of sister, and stuck in poverty for the rest of his life. His brain was maimed and his plans are doomed for failure.

Ki-jung (Daughter): She is the real mastermind that set up the driver, poisons the housekeeper, and manipulates the mother.

I agree with your premise they weren't ""good"" people. I think the movie addresses it pretty clearly - there's the scene where they're all eating & drinking in the Parks' house and the mother posits her reasoning: we're only bad because we're poor. If they were rich, they would be good people.

But is that true? Would they be better people if they were wealthy? As you say, in fact, they seem to become worse as they gain wealth; they become defensive and violently protective of their jobs & positions in the Park household. Contrasting with the start of the movie where they are a poor but happy family. This is illustrated in that drunk guy pissing on their house scene; at the beginning, they are deferential - do they stop him from pissing on their house? No, it's the wealthy cousin who does. Only later, when they feel empowered by their newfound wealth do they stop him themselves. They film it and laugh about it.

The Parks are another interesting contrast. They are outwardly polite and ""generous"", but ultimately do not see the Kims as equals; they view them as a commodity or tool.

I mean it's definitely wrong but they seemed pretty confident the Parks wouldn't notice so it's not like they were depriving them or being outlandishly wasteful(dad smashing a couple glasses aside) They didn't seem that greedy to me they just figured out a way to hook themselves all up with a job and by all appearances they seemed to be doing their jobs quite well across the board.

Remember they only got these jobs because Min recommended the son who had to fake being a university student to even be considered and from there it's all recommendations. Mr. Park would've never hired the dad to be his driver if he knew he wasn't currently in that vocation or that he lived in squalor the way he did, not in a million years but once he was given the opportunity the dad performs his job flawlessly. 

That seemed to be a very important message that they all had their talents but being given a chance was not easy, that infiltrating higher rungs of society is difficult without the right pedigree. The family all come together to try and convince the pizza lady to let the son interview for a part time job at a pizza place they were hardly looking for the easy way out. 

I don't really see an escalation to their greed as you seem to imply. They got the jobs, were happy and yes they were kind of day dreaming the son would marry the daughter and they'd be set up even more but that was seemingly in good fun like ""wouldn't it be nice"" but they didn't have a plan to start stealing from the Parks bank accounts or otherwise swindling them out of unearned money.",dps3xy

I’ll copy-paste another comment or two I wrote earlier.

Edit: here’s an earlier post I wrote about Mrs. Park: That sequence of her planning the party also helped cement just how out of touch she was from everyone below her class.  Mr. Kim and his family had just lost their apartment (he still smelled bad enough that she couldn’t help reacting to him) — heck, his whole neighborhood had to go to the shelter — and she’s blithely tossing groceries into the cart, boasting about how her son doesn’t need any presents (saying “oh, no need to bring presents” is another way of saying, “we’re SO rich!”), chattering about her friend bringing their cello (they ain’t cheap, either)...   I mean, she has the Mini Cooper hide in the garage because it’s not fancy enough to show off near their gate, but the Kims haven’t been able to afford a car in *years.*

And — unless she’s ordering him around — not once does she speak to Mr. Kim.

Picture being so broke that you have to stretch one single pizza across your meals all week, and your boss keeps running her mouth about her plans for Europe and the fancy restaurant downtown and how she had to drive the spare Mercedes because the convertible is in the shop and she can’t decide which bedroom set to buy this season and and and and...

fc4w9tc,"2. Regarding this, as an asian American I actually felt the Kim family has a very strong bond- the mannerisms, their inside jokes, the way they talk to each other is all very familial and warm to me. But I would understand why it might come off as distant to other cultures. 

Secondly, I think poor people being portrayed in a bad light is realistic. Lots of studies point to poverty being a big contributor to poor mental health, dysfunctional behaviours, and crime, so I think the Kim’s’ behaviour is less about their own selfish desires, but more a commentary about how poverty is a festering ground for these types of behaviours and how governments systematically discourage upward mobility (main character fails exam 4 times despite being smart). Remember Mrs.Kim saying when they were all drinking: “Mrs.Park is very nice (...) but I’d be nice too if I had that much money!”

It doesn’t excuse it, but we’re not meant to see the Kims as saints anyways- they suffered serious consequences for their actions.

A question I got from the film was: why do we, the onlookers, always expect poor people to somehow gather up the resources to ethically lift themselves out of poverty when they’re hungry, desperate, and surrounded by corruption? Them taking a morally questionable way to get out of poverty is way more realistic, to me, than passing the opportunity, taking the high road and allowing themselves to suffer for longer.",dps3xy

fcrday3,"I thought that the bit that really got to Kim was that Park was demanding that Kim drive him and his kid (who had only fainted) to the hospital while Kim's daughter lay bleeding to death from a serious stab wound.  Now add in the comments about his family's smell (in the middle of that bloody mayhem of all times) and that really reinforced the idea that Park viewed Kim and his family as literal garbage and it sent him (Kim) over the edge.

Just imagine watching your own kid dying on the ground while some guy demands that your stinky ass help him get his kid to the hospital so he can have a moist washcloth applied to his forehead to help him recover from the trauma of watching peons get stabbed to death.  F that guy.  :)

I will say that, during that scene, I wondered why Kim didn't rush his daughter to the hospital after killing Park.  Yes, he would have been arrested, but I figured he'd sacrifice himself in an attempt to save his daughter.  I guess he didn't because he's a pretty crappy person himself.

Edit:

I just wanted to add that, in addition to what I've written above, the entire Kim family was feeling a ton of stress at the time of the stabbings.  Their apartment had just been flooded with sewage, they had stayed in a gym the previous night, and they were trying to figure out what to do about the couple locked in the basement of the house.",dps3xy

ffth4l1,">I don’t know. This whole write up  was a big string of consciousness right after seeing it. I get that someone will say that “this movie is asking questions and letting the audience discuss the answers” but 1) a movie doing that is kinda lazy and 2) no I don’t think it is doing that. I think it wants to do that but I think it’s very accidentally saying the poor family was the bad ones.

I like how it created so many questions for you.  Movies that bore me are usually cut-and-dried (way at the opposite end of *Parasite*, I'll point to *Avengers: Endgame*; although fun, it left little doubt by the end), but how *Parasite* dodged the usual trope of ""poor family is morally pure and only a victim of circumstance"" is part of what raises it several levels for me.

I've said that I think each decision that the characters made, even if not the best in hindsight, seemed pretty reasonable at the time.  So how it escalated from skimming off a neighbor's wifi, to employing a family member through personal reference, to framing a caretaker with a communicable disease, and finally to murder, made me wonder at which point we're supposed to say, ""Okay, stop it, that's going too far...""  For me and my wife, the moment the film turned dark was when we saw Moon-gwang walking sadly away from the house right after she got fired.  Just a few minutes earlier, we were laughing at the heist-like montage of the Kims planning out their script, planting the peach fuzz, and using hot sauce as fake blood -- and then we're forced to confront whether it was actually *funny* to commit such life-destroying fraud.

As far as the ""message""?  I still haven't totally decided on a simple message.  The Parks aren't very innocent in all of this, either -- their first order of business was to cheat Ki-woo out of the full tutor fee and then lie about it, telling him that he's being paid more than they paid Min before.  But Mrs. Park is so polite and cheerful, we don't even notice it ourselves.  We might even consider it as a ""little white lie"" since it was only the first tutoring session and Ki-woo's expertise was yet unproven (but then we have to ask, when will he deserve a raise?).  And Mr. Park all but explicitly says to Mr. Kim that he'll never be welcome in his home as a friend or guest -- but only as an employee.

Go back and unpack the first five minutes of the film and you'll find a lot of implied backstory covering the Kims' better days.  From Chung-sook's silver medal, to the still-not-unpacked clutter from moving into the basement apartment, to Ki-taek putting on a facade to say that it'll be good to get free fumigation through the open windows -- and then angrily folding pizza boxes for less than minimum wage...

2.	The house was bought by foreigners right after the Parks left. The son made a plan and the director teased the fruition of the plan but the cold reality was that it is only a plan and a dream. And as mentioned at the gym when the father and son talk about making plans, cold reality has a way of interfering with those plans",dps3xy

The fact that the stabbing seemed to come out of nowhere was the point - the dad realized in the moment his daughter was killed by the homeless man that the battle isnt between the wealthy and the poor, the wealthy get to delegate the battle to the poor vs the poorer. The rich family was about to get away with everything completely unscathed while the rich dad was yelling at the man who just lost his daughter to drive him to the hospital. Like fuck that entitlement, fuck that inequality that drives people to such desperate circumstances. That's the real moral, and you missing it speaks to the subtlety of this movie.

fdck43i,You dont have to represent the rich to be total villains of the story in order to show the disparity between the rich and the poor. The one line from the movie says it all “Shes nice because she is rich”. If you think about it the main characters did or know what they do because of sheer desperation. Desperation that is caused by poverty. Its an amazing film because it is aware that poor people also do shitty things but not just because they are simply shitty but because they are desperate to live a normal life. Its not a typical poor is good people rich are bad.,dps3xy

the reason he killed park was definitely not because he was offended. he killed park because this is what park was ignorant too. The literal tooth and nail fight of survival that keeps his life going so smoothly and perfectly. he's so ignorant and uncaring to the working class he doesnt even care that ""jessica"" got stabbed and is dying , and having to touch a poor man and do the work himself disgusts him. at this point [mr.kim](https://mr.kim) can't take it anymore.",dps3xy

It wouldve still worked out for them if they werent held hostage with the video. If it wasnt that day, the maid would have come back another day when the Park family was out.  The park family coming back doesnt make a difference since its not like the park family caught the Kims so that didnt matter. As long as they dont get caught, then the kims will be fine. So its not really the fact that they all decided to stay in the house being the problem, but that they slipped. Would you blame a person irl in that situation for slipping in such a tense situation? You might argue, why would they go down there then? Well i think its fair for them to understand whats going down there so they can either save their mother if shes in trouble or so they can prepare for what theyll need to do next.  Intel is key.   
Also can i ask what specifically is non convincing for specifically whatever message you thought they were trying to send?",dps3xy
f6om2z2,"Actually, both being in the house and tripping down the basement stairs are problems, but the former is by far the greatest problem. If the Kims (except the mother) weren't in the house to begin with, how could the former housekeeper be able to have the evidence to threaten the Kims and make the Kims' plan fail immediately?

And, while the tripping down the stairs thing was indeed in a tense situation, their decision to celebrate in the house was clearly not made in any tense situation.

I haven't complained anything about tripping down the basement stairs, because the most important mistake was being in the house. (Again, I don't mean not being in the house would guarantee they won't fail, but at least they won't fail so quickly)

For the messages (or themes) told by this movie, you can find them in many other comments and I wouldn't repeat them here.

On the other hand:

The analogy of ""a poor person winning the lottery"" might be similar to the Kims situation, but I'd say their (temporary) success was 50% attributed to luck and 50% attributed to their smartness, because they wouldn't have been able to kick out the former employees without it. Smart people do fuck up in some way, but going to the house and providing a chance to blow their cover is too far stretched, at least to a level that bothers me. I mean, even normal (rich or poor) people with some common sense wouldn't do it.",dps3xy

The privileged outlook you have is that ""kevin"" should now work hard at his new job and save up money and now he should be a good little boy and thats it. the issue is that he cant afford to do that. He has to bring his family up with him too. The movie shows you very clearly. you can work hard to no avail like the gwang family . one member working hard the other withering away with no goals in the basement with debt, unable to do anything. or you can knock off other people and take what you need. The parks aren't noble amazing people. they're distant and aloof people who live off the struggle of the poor . they have no relationship to each other, cant get sexual without drugs and weird roleplay and dont even understand or love each other. when the fight of the lower class spills out before them they dont even bat and eye. try to help or anything. ""you poor people fight, i have things to do""  The kim family isnt lonesome theyre the only people with genuine love. you see them constantly supporting each other, laughing, goofing, bonding, and bringing each other up. no family member left behind. there is nobility in that. things just spiraled out of hand.",dps3xy

fhopicw,"I think the movie did portray the rich as gullible, simple and naive. Also alot of scenes that supported this.

But in real life, i think the rich is not 100% like in the movie. Plenty of rich people are kind and down to earth.

fco9j0a,"\#1 - Before that scene, it was shown that Da-hye, the Park family's daughter, was carrying Ki-woo on her back, meaning she found him first and was most likely planning to get him medical attention immediately. The father sees this during the commotion before he fled to the basement. From what I gather, there was a period of time when no one wanted to live in the house so he probably roamed around the area freely and happened to find out that they were alive through the newspapers reporting their trial.

\#2 - He plans to stay there to avoid jail time because he's the one who committed the most severe crime out of all the family members, which is stabbing Dong-ik. He can't go back home because both Ki-woo and the mother are being monitored by authorities, which means they know their place of residence. And it's not like they have a way to tell him that he can go back home once their monitoring has ended. 

\#3 - They moved away obviously. They can't be living in the same house where they would risk getting unwanted attention from the media with interviews that can further damage their reputation.

f972445,"The family was very drunk and the rich family had mentioned that the son loves the rain so they assumed that the rich family wouldn't be back. Plus they weren't really aware of how much rain there actually was until they found their home flooded.

They didn't exactly need to be experts in their fields. The dad looked at a Mercedes in the dealership in order to figure out all the buttons and stuff, but he could drive well enough for the rich dude to hire him. Housekeeping is really easy and isn't exactly a ""high skill"" job so the mom wouldn't have much problems. The brother and sister were definitely bullshitting most of the time so they weren't really experts.

The friend who goes abroad doesn't come back because he's not gonna come back to Korea and leave his studies just because a friend (and his family) got caught up in some shit. He has his own life and was most likely unaware of what happened while he studied.

Though the family likely made a load of money from scamming the rich family, they probably didn't make enough money to actually buy anything noteable (like a better place to live). I think they probably either pooled it all together to try to save for something, it got destroyed by the flood, or they spent it off camera for things like better food, make-up, clothes, etc. 

I don't really get your complaint about the subway train or hiding under the table. In Korea their subways are super important for traveling and many people will use it to get around (especially for people who can't afford cars like the poor family). So figuring out stuff in a Subway wouldn't really be a trope because it's pretty much the norm. If you ever go to Korea it's actually pretty funny because sometimes people do average things like doing their makeup (one chick I saw took the whole 40 ride starting her makeup). Hiding underneath the table/bed seems like a weak complaint especially since the house they were in emphasized open spaces without much places to hide

The letter the father writes in the end is long, but it's not like the guy has anything better to do in the basement. From my memory he writes different letters everyday (but I could be wrong) but it's pretty clear that those messages are the only way he stays sane and it doesn't really matter if the message gets out to his son or not. I wouldn't call the son seeing the Morse code a coincidence. We know the son was a cub scout and we know that he has a fixation with the house which is why he would go watch the house from the mountain/hilltop. It was only one day where he decided to stay longer that he noticed the Morse code. It's no longer a coincidence when the film hints at the idea of Morse code and also establishes a consistent behavior (the son watching the house) that explains how an event came to be.

Id say the story feeling slow or meandering is partly just a personal matter. For me I enjoyed learning more about each of the characters and the shenanagins they'd get into, and I did feel that the movie dragged a bit, but overall I felt the way it was presented was good.

TBH a lot of stuff is explained by the movie or they just expect you to figure out the most logical conclusion (like what happened to the smart friends the son had). It just seems like you didn't like this movie which is totally fine. People have been praising The Godfather since it was made but when I watch it I just shut down from how bored I get.

f9suxx2,"I think the family being very good at their jobs was a key plot point. They’re clearly smart, capable people who are not any different than the Parks. They were dealt a bad hand. 

We saw them go from assembling pizza boxes to scrape together enough money to buy food to going out to eat as customers of the pizza place. They were drinking more expensive beer too. They’re still poor, but were able to get their phones turned back on etc. 

I can believe they didn’t worry about the Parks coming back early because they were all inside getting drunk & then dealing with the basement people. I don’t think they noticed how much it was raining. 

The Morse code message may have been more written for narrative purposes, but the guy has literally nothing else to do. He’s basically in solitary confinement. Why not send out entire novels in Morse code, just in case his son thinks to check on the house? That seems like a tiny nitpick more than a plot hole.",dps3xy

fi8ig4d,"I think the point was that the Kims fucked up by trying to infiltrate the rich people to the point that they lost any sense of class consciousness. They were given an opportunity (the ex-housekeeper says it, “we’re both workers”) and they rejected it because they thought they were different or better. They could have realized they were in the same boat and helped out the ex-housekeeper and her husband but instead they freaked out and threatened to call the cops on the gross poor people, causing a conflict that led to all the murders. When their house flooded they were forced to realize that they were actually part of the working class. They may have seen themselves as better but in the end they’re still workers and Mr Park thinks they “smell bad” just the same as the husband in the basement. It’s like middle class workers siding with capitalists and turning their nose up at more obviously working class people because they think they’re basically in the capitalist class themselves, but when they’re faced with the actual reality of economics and class relations they realize they are workers and should have been allying with other workers for their own interests instead of fighting against other workers who aren’t as prestigious.

fi70dud,"Just from the filmmaking side, I enjoyed not being subjected to the same old ""poor people are always honest and noble"" trope that we're always spoon-fed.  I even laughed along with the increasingly-unethical scams until we watched Mon-gwang trudging sadly away from the Parks' house, which is when I finally started to question my own feelings about the Kims.

I also appreciated Director Bong's intent of ""making the audience feel multiple irreconcilable emotions at once"", especially when the Parks were on their way home and the Kims had to fight to put the other couple back in the basement.  That two-second span between Mrs. Kim cooly popping a reverse kick and Moon-gwang's head smashing against the wall was the fastest swing between ""Ha ha that's funny!"" and ""oh SHIT"" that I've experienced in a long time.

fi6hmt5,"I took this away from it; the class system *sometimes* creates immoral people in the lower classes because they have to be like this to survive. This usually manifests in the lower classes fighting amongst themselves for the little resources available to them while the upper classes either don't know or don't care about these struggles. In the movie the Park's are completely ignorant to the Kim's scam and the couple in their basement, going on with their relatively tranquil lives even though absolute chaos is happening all around them while the two camps of lower class families fight for dominance over this resource. I think Mr Kim represents the breaking point in class struggle, he's sick and tired of being treated like scum and wants make the rich pay. The basemant guy juxtaposes this as the lower class person who looks up to the rich as his saviour, as the Park's home has provided him shelter, despite the fact that had they known he was down there they would've cast him out immediatly. I don't believe there is supposed to be a good and bad side in the wider message (although the Park's are the obvious victims), because the Kim's were driven to undertake their scam because they had to get money to survive, and the basement couple were hiding out to literally save their lives from loan sharks. Mr Kim killed an innocent person, and now his circumstances are punishing him even if it's not by the juridiscial system. There is no good and bad in class conflict, just people born into circumstances they can't change. The wider message is to highlight the issue of wealth disparity and the conflicts it creates amongst fellow countrymen, not to make you feel sympathy for the Kim's in particular.",dps3xy

fhdziwe,"1. I think it was an easy way to move the story forward. I thought the stabbing was a bit abrupt, perhaps they showed him (jokingly) threatening to punch his wife to establish there was a layer of violence deep down in Mr Kim. 
2. Maybe she jumped on the poor son because Min was professional and turned her down till she was of age? She might've been frustrated at him turning her down, or moving away from her, so she jumped in. 
3.  Yeah that frustrated me, but the movie was pleasantly unpredictable with other scenes, so I'm ok with them not following this up.
4. I'm not sure how much she's getting. Park says the housekeeper eats enough food for two people, so she wasn't spending any money on food for her husband (although she says something different to the mum). 
5. I wouldn't have thought this important until she complained that she didn't get any ramen. Perhaps just another reason why she jumped on the poor son, because she wasn't getting any attention from her family? Mind you she pushed her brother's head into the wall, but what sibling hasn't thought of doing that.

fhf332q,"Just piggy backing on the Rich Daughter/Poor son commentary. I think it was more in line with the trope that he was being a parasite to Min... Min gave him an opportunity, and he promptly used that opportunity to parasitically milk it for everything he could. With the daughter, with having his family get hired, etc etc.

Everybody in the film was parasitic to an extent, which was so lovely.

&#x200B;

Rich mom - parasite of Mr. Park.

Mr. Park - (reaching but..) parasite of the working classDa-Song - Parasite of his mom's ""simpleness"". Playing up his stares into the sky as the daughter mentionedRich Daughter - Parasite of tutors, i.e swooning and lushing over Min and his replacement. Using english lessons to further a romantic interest.Min - Something fishy here by giving him the stone. We are left to assume but him giving the stone, and as mentioned ""abruptly leaving to study abroad"" indicates he might have forewarning about the house/bad omen/etc.. So he's using the Kims to escape?

Can easily make a case for everybody, but my point is that parasite is the game, but that doesn't mean it's inherently ""evil"" or even ""ill-willed"". You root for the Kim family in some parts, you root for the Parks in others. You curse the innocent 4 year old boy who is close to blowing their cover, and you laugh when a reasonable driver gets set up and fired to advance the plot.

Everybody is parasitic, that's the nature of the world. Realizing that can make you snap, which is what I think Mr. Kim did in the refugee sleeping scene. People look into why he snapped on Mr. Park versus what I believe is the better question of: Why did he snap? He sees below him (the groundskeeper and her husband) there are parasites, above him (Mr. Park's ""arrogance"") there are parasites, and it made him snap. (additionally, the class below the Kims stabs the daughter, so then Mr. Kim Stabbing Mr. Park is like 3 > 2 > 1 )

fhds61i,"Hey! In reference to your first point, the whole smelly thing was to showcase how the Parks thought about poor/needy people which hits home for ""Mr. Kim"". This is also right after the drunken comments that were made about how nice the Parks were, specifically referring to the line ""they're nice because they are rich!"" made by the mother. 

This is specifically important for the garden party massacre scene when Ki-Jeong had been stabbed in the chest and Mr. Park yet again made the ""smelly"" gesture and demanding for the keys instead of helping Jessica (or even show an ounce of empathy for that matter). In the heat of the moment, seeing his daughter bleed to death and Mr. Park's pinching of his nose, Mr. Kim made the emotional choice to stab him. Even though he hadn't made it about Mr. Kim in that moment and instead to the ex-house keeper's husband, Mr. Kim views both he and the husband as equals as they both have money struggles and a string of failed businesses.

Whether or not it was a good or bad decision, the situation proved how wrong of an impression the Ki's had for the Parks when it came to how they treat people of different classes.

fhgccj5,I saw the rich daughter/poor son dynamic as her outlet for attention. Her parents have pretty high standards for her and keep her on what seems like a tight leash but also neglect her and adore her little brother instead. So it would make sense that she would look for some approval and affection elsewhere. She probably did the same thing to Min and they both fell for it.,dps3xy
fhiqnra,"Just to add my two cents here to the points you’ve mentioned:


1. The smell is more of a running symbol and theme in the movie. This “poor”, lower class smell represents the Kims’ inability to escape and climb the stairs to the upper class. This smell simultaneously makes the rich family visibly uncomfortable and in Mr Park’s last scene you can observe his disgust. This is what made Ki-Taek snap. Throughout the whole movie this smell has been following the poor family, however this hit Ki Taek the most because he is the father of his children and husband to his wife. He is the head of the family, he sees his daughter bleed out and his son bludgeoned while he couldn’t protect anyone he loves. Instead he had to play Indian with Me Park to please their son. All of this after that disaster of a night that ripped him of a home. The water didn’t only take away his possessions but also his pride. He was literally swimming in shit water, intensifying the smell and what that smell stands for. Having him and his familiy’s dignity hurt so much made him lash out, he realised his own powerlessness, resulting in frustration and impulsively killing Mr Park. This is not to justify his actions but only shows the build up that led to this tragedy.


2. I think Ki Woo was too invested in the whole situation to even think about Min. His aspiration was to help him and his family get a better life, invested in this cause and seeing the girl show interest in him gave him confidence that he can eventually have a life that he dreamed of. From the girl’s perspective I believe it’s just a teenage crush, but she still showed care and love for Ki Woo when she saved him from the basement. She is quite a character and analysing her character would be a whole new topic.


3. Maybe this was also another superficial aspect of the rich family. Just as the Indian tent and toys are superficial, his interest in decoding the morse code could also be him just having fun. But I agree, it would have been nice to have this elaborated more in the movie.


4. Well apparently she did not earn enough. This makes me think of the ending of the movie, where Bong calculated the amount of years Ki Woo would need to work to be able to buy the house (which came out to be over 500 years). Depending on the amount of dept, it could possibly be a sum that both of them could never pay. Both the housekeeper and her husband were shown to be even lower class than the Kim family so I think this guess wouldn’t be unrealisitc.


5. Definitely adds to point 2. Her position in the family influences her character which also gives context to her crush on Ki Woo. Being neglected emotionally by her parents, it wouldn’t be unusual  for her to cling on anyone that shows interest in her and compliments her. 


6. I believe they never realised that the lights were manually operated. There is a scene in the movie where Mr Park walks up the stairs, with the light glowing along his way. This may suggest that the rich family always thought of the light as something inherent to the house. After all they did not know about the secret basement either. The morse code were sent during a time where none of the family members were paying attention, except for their little son.

fh7hsgr,"Logically, I agree. The fact that the smell issue got to Ki-Taek as his daughter was dying does seem pretty far-fetched, but also it was quite unlikely she was going to survive in the first place. According to the mother the paramedics were quite far away and Ki-Jung was stabbed in a pretty vital area.  

But you have to realise it's not the smell thing that got to him, it's the idea that his family will never be considered anything more than workers or people from the lower class. (That motif of crossing the line, he will never and should never (in the eyes of  Mr Park) encroach on their territory.) In addition to that, both their children are in need of help and still Mr Park insists that he drive them to the hospital (sure Mr Park doesn't know that those two are father-daughter, but he still doesn't care to bring the girl (who was supposedly helping his son recover from psychological issues)  bleeding out on his lawn. 

And to tie it all together, you have Ki-Taek taking the place of Geun-Sae in the basement and another wealthy family moving upstairs. It's all come full cycle with the rich still above poor.

You have to understand how the Academy Awards are polled. It's from people who appreciate the kind of work that goes into a film - there's a lot of stuff that goes unnoticed by those not in the industry.

Try this exercise: Think about how you would manage going about making a movie like this. Imagine you've been given millions of dollars to fulfil your filmmaking dream.

For those that watch a lot of movies, there are certain things that get old. Social commentary layered into aesthetic movies is not one of them.

fbin9hr,"I don't think the director was trying to get us to dislike the Park family because of their dislike of the Kim family's smell. Rather, I think the director was trying to show the discrepancies in society with the upper class being out of touch with the lives of the lower class, for example: how they consider public transport beneath them (Mr Park compares the basement/poor people smell to the subway, but in Seoul, as far as I'm aware, there is no actual smell); the sex scene with the Park parents where Mrs Park continually shouts ""buy me drugs, buy me drugs!"" - not knowing the underwear was a trap planted by the Kim daughter, who is forced to listen to the stereotyping of her presumed lower class less than a metre away. 

The movie itself isn't meant to be a comedic one, or if it is, it's cynical and mocking laughter at how big the disparity between rich and poor have become. It's a horrifyingly harsh movie with an ironic foretelling of the doomed fates of the poor (one of my favourites being Mr Kim asking the man in the basement ""How can you live here?"" but one day, will have to live there himself). 

I don't think the director was trying to show just one rich family as the cause of the socio-economic gap, but I think the director was trying to convey that the 'parasite' is poverty and it's inescapable for some in society (some might disagree with me here but after watching it two times, these are my thoughts).",dps3xy

She had the most talent — taming the son in just one therapy session is the best example — and therefore had the best chance to make it big.

And Bong likes to mess with our expectations.  Having slaves in the basement is what you may have expected, but the reality is less fantastical (and, IMO, even worse, because a middle-aged, down-on-his-luck husband is more relatable).",dps3xy

I think maybe its kind of like you said, that I had expectations on how it was going to go and it ended up going a different route. 

Perhaps on the contrary to your point, I found those first two acts very realistic (even if only ""movie realistic""). But the third act for me felt very un-real and fantastical. Like at first they were dealing with these very real societal problems, and then all of a sudden at  the end its a more physical danger i.e. a guy with a knife.

""who cares, give me my keys, what are you doing"" mr park doesnt bat an eye at the poor people fighting. why? because thats what he ignores everyday. thats just what poor people do and they stink. well this time he cant distance himself from it and mr. kim takes it to him. and whats the payoff? mr kim loses his light. he is now a roach in the basement. his daughter is dead. his son is in a month long coma and awakens and cant even feel sad anymore. back to square one. so its not only one character that loses out. the entire poor community takes a hit and what do the parks do? move out. sell their house. some other family moves in and is ignorant to whats beneath them.",dps3xy

That's what it's poking at, subverting the typical depiction of the poor family with a heart of gold and instead brutally showing that capitalism can not only deny you material things but also rob you of your basic sense of morality, humanity and dignity. 

There are plenty of shitty poor people. There are some legit nice rich people I know. Doesn't mean they all deserve their stations in life, and that shouldn't justify wealth inequality.

It's not that ""poor people suck too""

It's ""look at what wealth inequality does to your basic sense of humanity""

If you only depict poor people in these kind of movies as the morally upstanding one, then you also create a logic in where if the poor people are not up to that moral standing they deserve their status in life.

He and his co-writer also spent a couple years interviewing house maids, private drivers, and others in the servant classes.  He knows this material inside-out.

fh86iyj,"Interesting that you talk about laziness. There are quite a few comments further up in the thread I would give credit to for these two points: (disclaimer, I am not Korean so I am making these points second hand)

1) the father’s bookcase is actually full of legal texts and he makes references to law enforcement during the movie. It’s implied with these that he tried to be a lawyer / take the equivalent of the bar, which is highly competitive and one of the few ways poor people in Korea can rise quickly in society. The age of the books and the family’s place in society imply that he was never able to succeed. (https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/dps3xy/_/f6hgc67/?context=1)

2) the son has taken the post-high school exam 4 times. In Korea, taking the exam additional times can be to try to get into better schools. As the son says early on that the fake diploma from Yonsei (think Harvard/Yale/Stanford of Korea) is a loan from the future, it’s implied that he is retaking the exam to hold out for a top 3 college. He makes references as such when talking about the future when talking about the rich daughter. 

Please any Koreans out there feel free to correct me. Just wanted to bring up these points.

They tricked the Parks into firing the driver and the housekeeper, fine, they needed money. And I can understand staying at your employer's house while they're away but who gets drunk at their place or invades their privacy? I guess the point was that you can be nice when you are rich. Being poor does not make somebody virtuous. At the end, it looked like Mr. Parks was more worried about his son being traumatized than the girl getting stabbed so I don't really care he died.

They have no fear of having too little food an no future. And even though this poor family is horrible, they are like that because they have nothing to look forward to. No one ever cared for them so why should they care for other people. Also it seems like this family has more then enough even though they have barely anything. These poor people are literally fighting with each other to be able to serve the rich family below their noses and they dont even know what's going on. And then they lose their house because of this raining and the woman thinks it's wonderful because it makes the sky so clear and its good for a garden party. Also the rich guy considers firing the poor guy just because he has a bad smell, which could literally ruin his life. I think that its shitty what they did.

•	⁠Parasite's epilogue was imagined by the father, Kim Ki-taek
“

I brought up that theory with my wife, and she said, no way, the Parks’ daughter saved him and he got surgery to save his life despite suffering brain damage.

So we have at least three possible endings:

• Imagined by the father, as you say;

• Imagined by the son, who was saved and saw the Morse code, and wrote the letter of his plans — but he will never succeed in buying the house (his sister, RIP, had the most talent and the best chance);

• Or, it goes as planned, with the son graduating college and becoming rich enough to buy the house and reunite with his father.


What I think is great is, these all make perfect sense.  Everything was wrapped up by the end, and we’re still sitting here coming up with ideas about what really happened.  And it’s not like we had to make them up ourselves, either, because the director laid them out right at our feet for us to decide.",dps3xy
f66we60,"> Overall, Parasite is an amazing film that covers the affects of wealth disparity between the poor and the rich.

f6k1xl0,i agree. It was the only weak part of the movie.,dps3xy
f6gtv9v,"- the ending was supposed to be a bittersweet fantasy; theres absolutely no way the son could ever earn enough money to buy that house. 

- mr. kim stabbed him partly because of the “smelly” insults, but also because his daughter is bleeding profusely in his arms while mr. park wants the car key so he can take only his son to the hospital. 

- the romance was strange, but its also to show how cunning and backstabbing ki-woo/kevin can be (pursuing the girl even when his friend who got him that job clearly likes her before kevin even knew her, using his friend's exact line about when hes gonna ask her out). 

- how youre supposed to feel towards the family is never clearly stated in the movie; the poor family is capable and smart, but its revealed that theyre way too desperate to get out of their current financial situation that they'll do almost anything including murdering, and the rich family is pretentious and naive, but their immense love for their children is admirable",dps3xy
f6h381t,"I think it was impulsive. Maybe two reasons. First, he was emotionally unstable at the moment. Second, he was having frustration towards the upper class or class difference.

He just lost his house, because of the rain. With a situation like that, Mr. Kim still had to go and help Mrs. Park over a single phone call, even it was not his working day. He feels contrast between him and the Park's, class-wise. The heavy rain cost the Kim's their house, and for the Park's, it is just a good weather to throw a party. 

This class difference is showed in two ways. First by ""smell"". Mr. Park insults Mr. Kim's smell and he also indirectly relates to his class, by referring the smell to boiling rags or subway. In addition, Mrs. Park frowns at Mr. Kim's smell and do not even try to hide it. Second by ""line"". When Mr. Kim and Park are in Indian costumes, Mr. Kim tries to bond/relate with Mr. Park as a head/man of the family, regardless of their class. However, Mr. Park draws the ""line"" between him and Mr. Kim.

When Mr. Park picks up the car key, he is disgusted by the smell. The old housekeeper's husband (Geun-se) is very relatable to Mr. Kim. Both went through failure of running Taiwanese cake shop and struggles in current life. This behaviour of Mr. Park must have insulted Mr. Kim as him and Geun-se were in similar class, therefore stabs Mr. Park impulsively. Also he was mentally unstable since he just saw both of his kids seriously injured and no one cares for his daughter except her family.

One more reason might be from Mr. Kim's past experience. The movie implies that Kim's family tried hard to improve their situation in the past. However they are still living in semi-basement house. In the gym, Mr. Kim says ""No plan is the best plan"". This shows Mr. Kim's hopelessness or possibly some frustration about class mobility.",dps3xy

Obviously the Park family did not do anything wrong on the surface, but they were selfish, elitist, and willfully ignorant of the plight of the common folk. The Kim family were liars and grifters, but they definitely loved each other and were acting out of necessity, displayed empathy toward others (the cab driver, Geun Se, and Mr. Park), and even showed regret for their actions (Mr. Kim apologizes to Mr. Park’s picture, buries the housekeeper). Overall, they made several morally insidious decisions, but I think the film was clear in that they were pushed to the brink by the system so much so that in their desperation, they saw no other choice than to lie, cheat, and step on others to get by. The director, in an interview, also said that he didn’t want to portray the typical rich people are evil and poor people are angels dichotomy, and I think he did a pretty good job drawing everyone in the grey.",dps3xy

You could see it all through their mannerisms, how they abused the Parks' trust and shrugged it off as being okay because they're only as nice as they are because they're rich, the sequence where they're staying inside the house before the housekeeper drops by, etc. 

You're meant to be sympathetic towards the Kims bc they're the protagonists of the story, they have numerous sympathetic moments (same as the Parks) but the movie doesn't push that up front same as it doesn't push the fact that they're doing despicable things.

fi9yk6t,"Dig into how the Parks run their household, too.  Even when dealing with her new tutors, Mrs. Park is a cheapskate — she lied to “Kevin” and said she’s paying him more, when in fact she removed some cash from the envelope beforehand; and when she invited “Jessica” to the birthday party, she said to count it as just another lesson, meaning that she won’t pay any overtime even though it’s a Sunday.

And they didn’t try to get any medical care for their longtime housekeeper (who, up until then, they trusted with every aspect of running the house), but instead, they fired her with no legitimate evidence.

Mrs. Park is the sweetest-talking asshole in the film, IMO.  She didn’t call upstairs to her daughter to offer any ram-don, and she selfishly kept it away from Chung-sook, too.  But I still worry about her a bit, because when “Jessica” was upstairs for her first session, she was looking *super*-stressed, sitting sideways at the dining room table, nervously shaking her leg and staring at the floor.  Made me wonder what kind of pressure she was under, whether from her husband or if she pressured herself.

(edit: ah, but remember her picking up the shrimp at the grocery store, and she says, ""You know my culinary skills.""  Yeah right, she can't cook to save her life, so she's either lying to her friend on the phone, or she's joking about how she's spending money on a housekeeper.)

f72ocvy,"Class struggle is not black and white, and the Parks do do some pretty iffy things throughout the movie. This is not a film about evil rich people abusing the poor people uwu, it's about how the desperation of poverty and detachment of wealth clash and create an chasm between two families who otherwise have nothing but their kid's futures in mind. 

The Parks are not shown making people poor because they do not make anyone poor. That's by and large not how poverty works. They are simply a wealthier family living in the area, not tyrants. Their sin is detachment and naivety, not maliciousness. Meanwhile the Kims' sin is desperation and misdirected ambition, not outright blood thirst. 

Not everyone in poverty is there because they were abused and taken advantage of, not everyone who is wealthy is evil. But the point is that the worst of people still exists in both spectrums of humanity and that conflict in inevitable between those who have and those who have not.

Unlike SIBY this movie is not approaching the issue of poverty from a Marxist perspective, but a distinctly Korean one, which is far less concerned with the idea of exploitation than it is the fatalistic structures of class and wealth.",dps3xy

It's something you would to someone who you want to become more aware of their surrounding by thinking clearly/collecting themselves mentally/becoming aware of their situation). (ex. said when slapping awake a drunk person, snapping someone out of their daydream, etc).

So subs = get a fucking grip, ""fucking"" included bc Korean is a very contextually emotive language if that makes any sense. A lot of times, there isn't actually a curse word being said but the subtitle will include it because the speaker will either drop honorifics and say it rudely, which is basically a close equivalent to being cursed at in SK.

fjue5wq,"One thing a lot of more wealthy people don't understand about being poor is that saving and spending money efficiently is 10 times harder when you don't have much of it. If you don't have money now, then you can't invest money into improving your future and making long term decisions. Obviously that includes the obvious stuff like getting a degree, but even the simplest things cost more when you're poor.

For example, a wealthy person might see something which is on sale and be able to buy in bulk, ultimately saving money down the line, but a poorer person can't afford to buy that thing in bulk (toilet paper is the go-to example) now because they can only afford to buy stuff when its actually necessary. The same principle applies to much bigger stuff; can't afford to health insurance and your annual checkup? Look forward to declaring bankruptcy due to medical bills from something preventable down the line. Same applies to car insurance and obviously renting a home. In the long term, the lack of flexibility caused by being poor makes everything more expensive, and if there's any kind of disaster that exceeds the limits of your financial flexibility then you're just fucked",dps3xy

Most people living in poverty have only enough to just keep themselves breaking even. If they are lucky, they might be able to save up over time, but for many such things amount to little.

There is a certain threshold of wealth you need to reach before you can become immune to most of these things, be it hospital debts, natural disasters, sudden loss of income, death of a prominent breadwinner, etc. If you’re bellow that threshold, everything pushes you back down, and down even further.

fj7uy9j,"You missed a few key scenes. The smell was just a representation of his general disgust towards the lower classes, perhaps even subconscious.

The other thing was the 'crossing the line' comments he kept making. This was in reference to Mr Kim getting too personal. He didnt view Mr Kim as a human being, only as the chaeuffer that belonged to him. 

Every time Kim tried to empathise on the topic of being a husband or a father, Mr Park shut it down and reminded him of his place as a servant, below him. This culminates with the two of them dressed as 'Indians'. Kim notices that he is a good father and comments on this, hoping that they can find some common ground. Instead, Park overtly reminds him this time to know his place and to basically shut the fuck up and do what his told.

Imagine being invited to a birthday party and they still cant treat you like equals for one afternoon. This culminates with the stabbing. Park doesnt give a shit about them and just wants the keys. The rich run because its only the 'help' being stabbed.

He killed him because his daughter was dying in his arms and Mr Park didn't care at all, he asked the father why he was wasting time instead of getting the car keys so that he could drive his son (who was having a seizure) to A&E, that's when the father snapped.",dps3xy

fj5kgxa,"I think your critiques are fair, but I want to extend the film the benefit of the doubt as it feels very deliberate in most things it does. If I may offer my own perspective:

When characters break from their established tendencies, you can look at it as either an oversight or more generously as something intentional, meant to signify a significant change in their development or to recontextualize earlier behaviour. 

As /u/iPundemic mentioned, the fact that Mr. Kim seemingly snaps and stabs Mr. Park could be seen as incongruent with his earlier behaviour, but I think that it's actually well-done foreshadowing. When I first viewed that scene, I genuinely thought he was capable of hurting his wife, and I felt a sort of strained relief when he played it off as joking. His violence towards Mr. Park makes me think that he perhaps was never very far from following through on his earlier ""jokes"", and that scene (for me, anyways) did a good job foreshadowing his predilection for violence — even if he stopped short of actually comitting the violence, his mind certainly steered towards it.

Also, in my eyes the flooding of the house was sufficiently trauamtic/disruptive that I believed Kevin's disassociated state during the party. I think the loss of (or rather, severe damage to) his home made him consider how frigile his situation was, and he decided to take drastic action. That was just my interpretation though. It's certainly something to consider. 

It seems like there's a lot of ecological symbolism in the film, so perhaps there's some sort of fright or flight interpretation of both these events? It's certainly interesting to think about!

I do agree it seems like he should be dead after getting a rock to the head twice, though.",dps3xy

The third act is when the violence between the two poor families, something that has been worsening and worsening right under the Park family's noses, spills over into the public for all to see. Mr. Park is completely shocked, despite his role in the situation, and it's finally here where the penny drops for Ki-taek, when he realises what's truly driven this violence to unfold.

Which coincidentally happens to the rich too. The rich family were, in my opinion, a representation of ho that entire class of people view the poor.

Only thing I kind of agreed with was letting the maid back into the house. But it moved the plot forward. 

The son went down alone because he was going to kill them. The rest of the family wasnt planning to do that so only he went down. He checked on the woman because he wasn’t there when she fell and he didn’t even know she was dead or what happened to her. He didn’t check on the second one because.... he presumed he was tied up. He escaped by.... I don’t know it was only duck tape, probably writhing around for the 12 hours that passed. 

Mr Kim was being ordered to drive the family to the hospital while holding his dying daughter. When he rolled over the killer (who had nothing but upmost respect for mr park and did the killings in part as a service to him) he plugged his nose, basically being a snob amidst all of the tragedy  and showing how much disdain he has for people below him (people like mr Kim).",dps3xy
fnmisos,">Letting the old maid back in the house -- why would Mrs. Kim every allow that? Say no, go away, you have the rest of the family dining and there's no reason to take the risk.

Completely agree with you here. Anyone, especially a seasoned scam artist, would just say ""I don't feel comfortable letting you in without the Parks home"" and threaten to call the cops if she didn't leave. But even if she let her in for whatever reason, the initial argument in the basement is beyond stupid. Just say ""absolutely I will"" to the old maid and tell the Parks as soon as they're home. Only thing I can think of is maybe the Kims want to avoid authorities getting involved at all costs since the authorities would likely reveal their true identities in the process.

But even then, the whole reason Geun-sae is in the basement was so silly that I couldn't suspend my disbelief. Hiding from loan sharks for 4 years? Wouldn't anyone rather just move across the country and work a cash paying job than live in self-imposed imprisonment? Especially after 4 years. It would kind of make sense if he was hiding from a national security agency, but loan-shark thugs can't devote that much time/resources to finding the person that ripped them off 4 years ago.

My disappointment with the film centers around how for the first half to work, the Kims have to be smooth and cunning con people: they forge documents, rehearse conversations, poison people, eavesdrop, manipulate and improvise. Halfway through they completely change: they are cartoonishly clumsy, impulsive, and can't think 30 seconds into the future.

But it was clear to see that he prioritised his son more than a bleeding girl. And that riled up Mr Kim.

Not only that, but it was with how he treated the man from the basement, who had been respecting him secretly down under their house. And to see him even plugging his nose at the man who seemed to respect him too much, made him realise just what kind of man Mr Park was. He was upper class, and he will always regard himself as the upper class. In the scene where he talks about Mr Kim's stench, he referred to it as ""that special smell people in subways have"".

Added to the fact that psychologically/ statistically speaking most murderers are committed because of small signs of disrespect, you can see why he killed Mr. Park.

The first thing they did with their new found money was to buy better beer and meat for bbq, restore their wifi and data services. They probably have debts and tenancy agreements too. Moving out will happen, but probably in the near future as they get their finances sorted out.

The son didn’t get rich at the end.

He’s still stuck in the semi-basement as he was in the beginning, at an even worse state with his father missing, sister died, and mom ill.

The house is a metaphor for the elites and ruling class, who are oblivious, ignorant, and insensitive to the poor. The poor have to fight with each other for scraps and when they couldn’t take it, they lash out at the ruling class through uprisings to kill the ruler (Park) but in the chaos, the people most suited to bridge the gap between the classes or resolve the conflict between the poor are killed or hurt (The ADHD son and Jessica).

Something that I'm struggling about with the film is who I'm supposed to have sympathy with at the end: it's definitely not the poor family, I kind of feel sympathetic towards the former housekeeper and her partner after what happens to them during the film, and whilst they were also freeloading off the rich family, they are doing it just enough to survive, and the husband/partner is fully dedicated to doing what he can without being found out.
The poor family are shown as being freeloaders, and taking advantage of everything they can, with no concern for anyone else. At the end the father isn't concerned about what has happened to the former housekeeper, and the son goes off to attempt to bludgeon them to death, and the whole thing ends with the poor father murdering the rich father.

To me it seems that the message of the film is that rich people are fighting a losing battle to protect themselves, and that poor people will take advantage of any situation, and should never be trusted.

The smell is such a hurtful critique to Kim because it represents the completeness with which poverty has tainted him as a person, not that it’s some insurmountable functional problem.

Regardless, I really didn’t think the movie was all that unrealistic within reasonable film parameters. What parts were so unbelievable that they took you out of the experience? Obviously if you’re spending your time looking for inconsistencies, you’ll find them, but that’s probably not the best way to approach a movie. It’s art, the whole point is that it doesn’t have to be completely realistic. 

I think if you wanted a sense of justice at the conclusion you may have missed the point.

ff3qqmp,">Also, for such an artfully told story, there isn't any sense of balance or justice at the end.

That's what makes it a more intelligent movie than if everything is a perfectly wrapped up Hollywood ending. 

What makes the ending impactful is that it is cognizant of how the world actually works. We see a fairy tale ending- the son find success and wealth, able to move into the giant home and save his father. But given what we've seen so far, it seems off- if he could just become rich that easily, why did it take so much work just to get to the service class? Then its revealed that its just a fantasy and its unlikely he will ever be able to work his way up.

People seem very hung up on the film being unrealistic, which is an unsophisticated critique imo, allegory is a corner stone of storytelling.

Absolutely. This movie put a lot of emphasis on ascension and descent; the sequence of them going home in the rain after sneaking out of the Parks home is literally all downhill.

this is seen in the father’s reaction when asked if he loved his wife, seen in the unequal treatment in the son and daughter, in which the son is clearly the favourite. the father doesn’t show the same obvious signs of affection towards her, as he does to his son. similarly, the ramen don situation highlights this. the mother asks the son, then her husband, and then chooses to eat it. notice how nobody in the family caught on to their own daughter getting into relationships with not one, but TWO tutors. love and family takes the backseat, and in the end that’s what causes the wealthy father’s death.",dps3xy

fd4j7uj,"Yea there was a collective gasp in the audience when the kiss happened.. I think it speaks to the larger problem in Korea where the whole age gap is often overlooked and justified.

Another factor is the mandatory 2 year military service. Korean men usually begin their military service when they turn 18, usually the age they are supposed to enter into university. However, after military service when they begin university, they are now 20-21 years old, whereas their female counterparts (who don’t serve in military and begin university right away) are just 18, or haven’t turned 18 yet. However, the age of consent is 20 in Korea, not 18, which makes it even worse. Also, Koreans turn 1 when they are born, not 0 like in the US. 

Another note - There’s a Hyuna song called “BABE” where she addresses the infantilization of young korean women in the kpop industry. Men in the industry and male fans constantly young-ify these korean women, that’s why “baby-face” is such a big thing.",dps3xy

It's like when my sister's family was shopping for a new home and one top choice was this unique architectural semi-masterpiece.  Our dad pointed out that, yes, it's nice, but everything you do to decorate and furnish it will also have to match the house's style or else it'll look terrible.

It also played out in how the families related to themselves.  The Parks' daughter was mostly left abandoned in her room (her mom didn't even call her downstairs for ram-don that night) and their son just ran around out of his parents' reach.  The Kims were tightly-knit, always eating together and cooking up plans as a group.",dps3xy

She's responsible for contracting out the household chores, managing the education of their children, and making sure that everything at home is in order. Mr. Park saying ""yes, we could call it love"" shows that Mr. Park views marriage as more of a formal arrangement or contract than the result of a romantic relationship.

1. Parasite

2. The Handmaiden - Brilliant cinematography, very well-written and beautifully-layered story (Amazon Prime)

3. I Saw The Devil - Possibly the best villain acting I've seen in my life. Incredibly intense and physical film. (Tubi, I think)

4. Oldboy - The quintessential Korean revenge film. Min-Sik (lead actor) is also in I Saw The Devil. Many think Oldboy is his best work but I still defer to my previous recommendation above! (Buy)

5. Burning - It's a slow burn. Yeun gives a pretty great and subtle performance which has you questioning him the entire movie. (Netflix)

6. The Chaser - Nonstop action/plot progression. The opposite of Burning in that the narrative is very focused and quick-moving. Another revenge movie. (Hulu)

7. Memories of a Murder - Crime movie from the police's point-of-view. This is a favorite for many and really digestible for new fans of Korean cinema. (Amazon Prime)",dps3xy

They would decorate their homes with them and carry smaller ones in their pocket to bring nature indoors and give them a feeling of calmness and humility. Since then, they’ve been associated with dignified intellectuals and high education. They’re still quite expensive to this day.

fe64ppu,"I wonder, actually. It's interesting that Min is the only character that isn't explored in any meaningful way. Still, aside from his literal actions in the plot, and aside from the fact that he serves as a kind of distant model for Kevin...I feel like Min probably represents, in some sense, the bridge between the rich and poor. While Min seems to come from a well-off background (affluent enough to collect rocks?), he doesn't seem to be as loaded as the Parks, especially if he went to the same school that Kevin did. As a member of the middle class, it is Min who links the Kims to the Parks. Otherwise, how would those two groups of people ever overlap?

This may be especially relevant in a country like South Korea, which has infamously low social mobility. I think Ki-taek (the Kim father) has a line about this - how hundreds of university graduates apply for a single security guard position. The one who gets the job, then, is the one who has connections. This only further cements class divides, since haves and have-nots typically don't network with each *other* - they can't afford to go to the same schools, have the same hobbies, etc. etc. But seriously, the Kims and Parks live in totally separate worlds - the Kims are struggling to survive, the Parks barely register the existence of the poor. In the middle - Min is grounded enough to be friends with Kevin, but rich enough to have valuable connections.

Min, it seems, is their ONLY connection to the upper class. That one referral is viewed to be their ONLY chance to claw their way out of poverty - it is virtually impossible for any of the Kims to ever move up in society without such a connection, and this is the *only* one they've got. That might be part of why they go into the plan with such desperate enthusiasm - the referral, the rock, everything from Min is basically a lottery ticket, and they have to make the most of it if they don't want to remain stuck in poverty forever. Just spitballing there, I'm curious to know what others think regarding the significance of Min's involvement with the plot.",dps3xy
ff414d4,"One of the more annoying things that I've seen people who are like the Kims are their tendency to assume that the rich are rich so therefore any loss of their valuables are easily replaced.

The truth is, people like the Parks and Min usually really appreciate what they have and rarely think how replaceable their possessions are. The reason they have what they have is partly because they take good care of their possession.

They don't just throw away money needlessly even though it may appear that way to the Kims. All their expenses are calculated either to preserve their wealth, to create more connections, or to better off themselves.",dps3xy
fe65f1h,"The existence of the Da-hye subplot is interesting to me...I mean, is it *really* necessary to the narrative to have these two guys lusting after an underage girl? Why can't Min just offer the tutoring job as is, out of the goodness of his heart?

There’s something to be said about the Kims themselves, that they don’t really put much stock in class solidarity and outright screw over some other people that are in the same position as them, but if you came away from that movie thinking that their own choices are what put them in the position they are in, I really don’t know what to tell you man.

f7rijao,"I thought the entire series of interactions between the Kim family and the old housekeeper and her husband was an interesting reflection on how poor people often have to jostle with each other in a zero-sum game. It was kind of funny how before the scene where the old housekeeper returned in the rain, she seemed so well put together, and conversely Chung-sook seemed well put together from the old help's perspective up until the other family members fell down the stairs. After which the façades (which poor people have to wear in front of rich people/""polite"" society) also came crashing down.

The burial struck me as a kind gesture, towards something not quite like atonement. But at least comes from a place of acceptance that the mutual enmity and violence between the two families were ultimately senseless. At the end, only the Kims had a good idea of just what the housekeeper and her husband were going through (you can see from the news reports afterwards how society at large views it from a distance). And vice versa. That's kind of how I saw the scene where Chung-sook was looking over the grave - no one else knew about it but her and her family. So if not for paying respects, then I think she at least would've felt somewhat compelled to visit the grave for some sense of closure. It was a kind of closure that they won't get in reality because again, I think Ki-woo acquiring the house is straight up not going to happen.",dps3xy

It would also explain why he was sneaking up to the house in the middle of the night and scaring the shit out of Da Song on his birthday.",dps3xy
fmxbwm7,"I know this is a really old comment, but I want to add that the “therapy” part of her work was not even a scam either. She is able to identify that he did undergo a traumatic experience at a young age and is attempting to process that through his art before the mother says anything about it. This is not ever stated in the movie, but it’s implied his “self portraits” are illustrations of when he saw the maids husband in the basement. His ability to recognize the Morse code in the lights only further convinced him that the house is truly haunted, which causes his strange behavior like wanting to sleep outside on his birthday.  Jessica is the only person who encourages him to directly confront his trauma. The parents only try to distract him by buying him things he likes and and taking him on trips. 

This is also similar to the park daughters relationship with the Kim son. The park family ignores their daughter, the father only greets the son when he comes home from work and we only see him talk to her to tell her not to be so grumpy. The mother does not even think to ask if she would like dinner as well when she has the Kim mother make her ramdon. The Park daughter has become dissatisfied with her family as she sees her younger brother get more gifts and attention from her parents, and the Kim son is the only one who is willing to listen to her air her grievances against him which is why she immediately falls for him. This is what gives her the desire to save him once he gets hit by the rock, and this is also one of the only times we see a member of the park family actually go down a staircase rather than up, a metaphorical act of lowering herself to his status.

The children are not as established in their class roles, which allows them to form real connections with each other while the parents are already deeply intrenched in theirs. Their relationships with each other are much more transactional, they cook, clean, and drive for them and are not expected to have a relationship beyond that. When the Kim father does try and form an emotional connection with the park father by asking if he loves his wife, he is shot down and basically told to “not cross the line.” This is also why the park son is the only one who recognizes anything strange going on in the house, as he’s the youngest. The park parents are so disconnected from the average person they don’t notice there are poor people hiding in their basement and sneaking around their house because they can’t even bother to glance down every once in a while.

I will need to watch the film again, but I also don’t believe the Kim son actually failed the entrance exam, his friend actually stated he did extremely well in English. It seemed implied that his family simply could not afford to send him to college, leading to his original plan: to tutor the park daughter for one year to save enough to finally go. Even with the sister dead, he had some chance of achieving something but due to the fact he is now brain damaged from the rock attack this will likely never happen. This is an example of the fathers belief that the poor are better off not making plans because things never end up the way they expect them to. The only option he has left is daydreaming of a future that will be impossible for him to achieve, and the ending is unbelievably crushing when we realize that it is just a dream. Everybody loses even though nobody is at fault, both families are destroyed because of the class system they exist within.",dps3xy

Did you notice how they got to their house from the Park residence during the storm? Ran down the hill from their home, lower and lower until the reached the bottom, and the story takes the time to show this. The Park residence is literally an ivory tower over them.

And after losing everything, after being shamed by Park, the whole family, and especially the father have to go and play monkey in front of the Park family.

The father's daughter is laying there dying at his feet and all Park cares about is the car keys for their son who's relatively unscathed and probably acting out again. The last straw is Mr Park turning over a dead man, and still having time to make a face at the smell of one of the Kim's fellow basement dwellers. Such a simple gesture, but after everything that had happened so telling and unbareable

Meanwhile in Joker literally 99% of Arthur's problems come from all rungs of society. The poor mistreat him just as much as the rich, if not much worse.

Tbh, I think all of this could have been avoided if Chung-sook didn’t open the door (which sort of shows how selfish and concerned with my self-preservation I would have been if that had been me). The abruptly fired ex-housekeeper showing up bloodied and bruised claiming to have left something behind would have been good enough for me to not let her in and I would have threatened to call the police. 

But of course, the family was panicked and probably feared that maybe they’d tip something off if they didn’t let her in or maybe it was just the sheer awkwardness/bizarreness of the situation that made them give in.

There’s also far more ambiguity with the characterizations in Parasite whereas Get Out has a more black and white (heh) presentation of its characters, thus very clearly telling the audience who it should like and who it should hate.

I still feel like the quote that was translated to stink bug reinforced that foreshadowing. And how Mr. Park would just as easily exterminate the Kim's from his household once knowing where they come from.

· You're probably right about Ki-Taek's roll in that scene. Again, so far I've only seen it once about a month ago so some details I'm pretty vague on. But I am excited to watch it again for these details that I've missed and how Ki-Taek's character anger rises throughout the film.

· Thank goodness you actually see that low wage/factory symbolism as well. I was beginning to think I was stretching too much on that one. But you said it way better than I ever could have.

· I do agree with you that such items are something that anyone would do as soon as they're able to afford it. I do think that the number of chairs around that table and how often only 2 of them sat at the table played a big roll in that symbolism though. (not even the entire Park family all at once sat at it) The fact that there's 10 chairs and 10 important characters living in that house is demonstrating that the rich have too much to spare, and yet they don't spare it.

f8ugoua,"A couple points to clarify —

Three-fourths of the pizza boxes were fine.  The one family member who messed them up was the father, Ki-taek.  I’d also say that he messed up because he was too embarrassed about the state of his family — underground, no job except folding some pizza boxes, coughing in a cloud of pesticides... He sat there, looking down, angrily folding boxes in silence.

The athletic medal wasn’t the father’s, either — it was his wife’s.  She won it for hammer throw at a local or regional event (as said elsewhere).  Olympic-level athletes can earn a pension for winning medals, but not her.  A brief moment of personal triumph that has done nothing to keep the family out of poverty.",dps3xy

It’s the total opposite",dps3xy
f6emzxb,"The two aren't related, but separate.

Some of the books shown in the basement of the Parks' house in Geun-sae (the Ghost)'s ""apartment"" hint that Geun-sae used to study law. Up to 2017, there was a Law Attorney's Exam in Korea that certified anyone to practice law as long as they could pass the exam. While this exam was extremely difficult to pass (and very competitive), a lot of people studied for it as it was seen as a ticket from the lower class to the upper middle class. Geun-sae probably started out his life from a middle-class family and probably wasted most of his 20s trying to pass this exam. Afterwards, he tried to open businesses instead, but failed in that regard as well.

With Japan, a few details stand out:

* The ""song"" to better remember the details (Jessica, Illinois Chicago, ...) is sung to the tune of a song called ""Dok-do is Our Land,"" a Korean nursery rhyme. Dok-Do is an island in the East Sea (I am showing my colors as a Korean here) that is the crux of a territorial dispute between Korea and Japan.
* The shrimp Mrs. Park buys from the grocery store for Da-Song's birthday party is from Dok-do (shown in a poster behind the cash register)
* The crab-meat snack for one of the dogs (Foofoo the Pomeranian) is imported from Japan
* It's difficult to find Korean written anywhere in the Parks' house, but there is some Japanese print shown here and there, on different boxes or products.
* Ki-Taek briefly mentions Japanese Sympathizers ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinilpa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinilpa)) during his ""Plan"" speech (When you don't have a plan, it doesn't matter, whether you kill someone, or sell your country out, or...)

Later on during the flood, the rock is floating and Kevin pics it up out of the sewer water (rocks don’t float).

At the end of the movie he places the rock into a moving river and it sinks. 

In the end the rock gave them prosperity but they did it in a very conniving way which made the rock fake. It floated in dirty sewer water, but it sank like a real rock in pure clean water.

You could make a long list of parasitic actions for each character, but the dad is set apart. Possibly most poignantly when he asks his family if they think the man whose job he took is doing ok.

He is definitely shown to have some unique motivations/perspective and seems to be the most dissatisfied with the role of overt parasite and strives hard for more, to a fault. Something must have really been eating at him to stab a nice enough man for being revolted by another person's smell (I acknowledge just about everything in the movie builds to this). I think it was because he, more than the rest of the family, really really hated what they were doing and were. The man had a lot of dignity that was continually shit on throughout.

fgrzkj5,"I saw them as a bloated host. I mean, they don't exactly need the Kims to survive. They abuse their services at times, but the Kims could be swapped out with any employees and it wouldn't make any difference to the Parks. My evidence for that, is that that is literally how that plays out on screen. The Parks fire their previous employees without a moments hesitation, at the first sign that the relationships with those employees are no longer symbiotic. 

On the flip side, the Kims need the Parks. If not the Parks, some other host/""plan"" to latch onto. I mean Ki-woo is never going to see his father again because he simply will never have the money to buy the house. And his father wouldn't even still be alive in that house (like a parasite with a dead host) if the German family didn't buy it and start filling it with food. 

The Kims have incredible grit and determination to survive, and use whatever means necessary to do it. They're very intelligent and crafty, yes, but I don't think that that doesn't make them parasites. I think maybe you're looking at the themes of the film through the negative connotations of that word? But I also think that was sort of the intention of the director.

fk5syan,"I don't agree. I can understand it was humiliating for Kim Ki-taek, but I very much doubt he had plans for any sort of real retaliation. The Parks were their ticket out of poverty. Hadn't it been for the basement incident, he would've just let those remarks be for what they were and continued to serve Mr Park so his family would continue to have enough income for a decent livelihood. He's far from the only person who has a tempered hate for his boss but sucks it up anyway because, you know, money.

I fully agree with OP, this is a man who's watching his daughter dying, his son being gravely injured and his wife barely escaping an assault on her life. When Mr Park shows complete disregard for his dying daughter, as if she and the rest of his family were nothing but cockroaches, Ki-taek just loses his sanity and enrages. And sure the comments about his smell were important catalysts leading to that moment, but by themselves they would have never led to any form of retaliation serious enough to compromise their jobs, let alone something as grave as murder.

I do understand that watching it from the outside it appears more malicious. Mr Park, while being a total asshat overall, at that moment is just concerned about his own son's well-being. After all, the movie tells us Mrs Park genuinely believed the seizures were fatal if not treated promptly, so it's not impossible to assume that Mr Park thought so too. It's easy to judge from the outside, but a lot of us would've acted similarly had we believed our own kid was dying. Mr Park appears to be less naive than his wife though, so it remains a bit of an open question if he truly believed his son was in immediate danger. Assuming he did, neither of the dads were clear-minded in that very moment and so they both did something completely reprehensible, yet understandable. That's the beauty of the movie.",dps3xy

She is constantly praised for being a con-artist and for being a photo-shop master. The film focuses on her character intelligence, and fortitude. I did not notice that she was the only one sitting on the couch which could symbolize that she, herself, is better than the rest of her family. 

I think the order of events matters a lot because we see his traumatic brain injury scene followed with the letter he writes and then the scene where he buys the house and releases his father. The scene just shows him going home to write the letter. In the end, we will never know if he succeeds but the odds are against him.

It added to the ongoing discussion on class mobility issues in Korea. There are regular protests going on in Seoul (near Gwanghwamun) nowadays regarding the current administration as well.

Korea has been hugely partial in favor of people of good academic backgrounds (people from SKY Universities [short for Seoul National / Koryo / Yonsei] tend to earn far more than those from other ones, if you ever get into college). This is why Ki-Woo first forges the document for Yonsei University in order to establish his legitimacy. 

Moreover, baby boomers (those born in 60's since the war ended in 50's in Korea) are still working, leaving small openings for younger generations.

Hundreds (maybe thousands?) lost their homes due to the horrible flooding. Mrs. Park is happy the rain cleared away the pollution so she can see a pretty blue sky. 

It’s not evil, but it’s such a disconnect from the realities of the people around her - the people she relies on to make her world function properly - that she may as well have said, “Let them eat cake!”

The way poor people smell was a recurring issue, meanwhile Mrs. Park has her feet up on the headrest, inches away from her driver’s face. 

The party scenes really illustrate how little consideration the Parks give to the people around them. It doesn’t even occur to Mr. Park that maybe he should help the housekeeper set up these heavy wooden tables she’s lugged upstairs. When his son collapses, he demands his driver abandon the girl bleeding to death in his back yard. At this point the assailant is still actively trying to murder their housekeeper!

Mrs. Kim stays at home and prepares to move to a nicer joint, and everything works very well.  Plus the housekeeper never causes problems and life is good.  The Park's were naive and stupid, but the Kim's overreached too far too fast.  Patience is required, if your're looking to make the transition and cross that economic divide.

And yes, they do look down on poor people. I'm not saying that they should've donated all their cash to poor people, cancelled the party or something, but maybe be careful with their words after the flood(which was shown on TV IIRC) around someone who could've at least known people who've suffered from it, not to mention how they've noticed his ""poor people"" smell and discussed it often. They've suspected that their driver had sex with a drugged woman, but didn't report it, because they were afraid for their reputation. Instead, they kept the panties of the ""victim"" and roleplayed the scenario. Finally, not one of the party guests was helping ANYONE during the ending and when Ki-Taek was trying to stop their tutor's bleeding(obviously they had no idea that it was his daughter as well), they were forcing him to abandon her and drive their son into a hospital instead of taking her with them as well.

It's selfish but it's understandable (to an extent) and it's universal. The only reason we don't call the rich family selfish and murderous is that they werent put in a situation where they have to fend for themselves: that's what privilege is. But were they not selfish? To call the Kim family ""ill-intended people"" misses BJH's point that the ""system"" exploits human nature (human selfishness) by pitting the poor against each other. They are not the perfect people, however BJH challenges the audience to uphold their values in the face of this challenge (will you still afford humanity to an oppressed group if they aren't perfect people? because that's how it is in real life. are you able to differentiate between humans being how they are and the mechanisms of the ""system""?) which I think is genius and part of what makes this movie so great.",dps3xy

In fact, the rich family was not caricatured, or even morally compromised in this movie at all, which was refreshing. It's overly popular nowadays to demonize and caricature the rich. Most of them are ordinary people.

On the flip side, the Kim's were not caricatured either. And they represent only one part of ""the poor."" Sure they were likable, family-oriented, and resourceful, but they were almost always dishonest (On the other hand, the Parks were always honest). There is a subset of ""the poor""  that you must be wary of; same with ""the rich."" The only difference is that there are many more poor than there are rich people, therefore the base rate of finding exploitative, underhanded people is far higher among the poor.

Outstanding essay.

I had assigned Da-song to a role of adding tension to the story, a Hitchcock-style “bomb under the table” which kept us wondering if he’d expose the Kims’ schemes.  But I like your analysis of him as a metaphor, too.

I was thinking again about the “poor versus the poor” situation earlier this week while listening to stories about a famous teachers’ strike in New York City in 1968.  At some point during the strike, the narrative shifted from the demands of the mostly African-American teachers to portraying them as being in conflict with the Jews in the administration.  In other words, rather than addressing the problems of the system, the WASP-y upper class pitted the working classes against each other.",dps3xy

fiizr5w,"Very good points. 
Just my food for thought. I felt like the rock represented hope. However, in life, we can't control it because there will always be unforseen situations that will come up like that of the underground couple. The Kim's family thought they had arrived, eating and laughing, and everything gets turned upside down within a second. With everyone controlling their lives, there will always be a problem in ones plan which is why the plan that is successful is no plan at all.

Also, the little boy and the girl, knew something was up from the start. The girl had mentioned that she thought the girl tutor was fake from the start.

In a nutshell, it's the same object but with different interpretations. 

Interpretation 1: Min-hyuk's grandfather honors nature, thus he put the suseok on a custom made base. So that base is a symbol of reverence. 

Interpretation 2: The Kims only received the suseok (on that custom made base) as a gift. But they're not living by that principle of honoring nature. So for them, the suseok becomes a symbol of naturally made thing + artificially made stuff that got attached to it. Living with it, but not being a part of it. Kinda like a representation of a parasite (even though the base doesn't do the suseok any harm, but the symbolism and interpretation is there imo).",dps3xy

The “ticking clock” was when the Parks would walk in the door, so we were watching Moon-gwang nearly expose the whole scheme without knowing if the Kims would get out of it.

The further they got into their scheme, the further they grew apart, coming to a head when the father almost hits the mother in the living room.  

By the end of the movie the family loses a member and the father is further separated from the rest of them.  To me this symbolized how they were able to still enjoy the things that mattered in life, regardless of their financial situation, and the more and more ambition they had for more wealth, the more they lost their value in those things and the more and more those things slipped away until they were damaged beyond repair.",dps3xy

Bong Joon-ho said in an interview that the final scene was supposed to leave the audience feeling hopeless and show that it was just a pipe dream. It might just be optimism, but I will say that the first time I saw it I had a different interpretation. A lot of stories with a father-son dynamic that I have seen before ended with the son forging a new path for himself and realizing he can't just follow perfectly in his father's footsteps. I think Ki-woo realized that conning people or taking the easy path to wealth wasn't going to get him anywhere. Instead he is making a plan and committing to hard work, or vigor as he was telling Da-hye, which is represented by him returning the stone back to the mountain where it came from. That's what I thought before I read that interview anyway. I still see it as a somewhat ambiguous ending, like you said.

I'm really glad I went and saw it a second time, it was just as thrilling as the first time and I caught a few more small things. Mainly foreshadowing to the fact that there was something in the basement. Also, I got my whole family to come with this time so I can talk their ears off about it now. :)",dps3xy

With a basic understanding of the current economic landscape in South Korea, it is *entirely* believable to think that the Kims would all have some talents/skills, yet struggle to get out of their semi-basement regardless. Sure, those same skills might be easily marketable and lead to wealth in *your* country, but not necessarily so in present-day South Korea.

All this aside, you're also exaggerating the unbelievability of the skills the Kims have. 'Professional driver' here simply means: drive from point A to point B without crashing, which is not so hard to believe. The son's skill is simply knowing English and knowing his way through a conversation. The mother is mainly just taking care of the house.

Also, Mr. Park thought the lights had sensors, hence why they turned on when he walked past. But it was just Geun-sae turning them on from the bunker. Even Mrs. Park thought the lights had sensors, from when Geun-sae was hitting the light button repeatedly.

I disagree that the lower class people had much to do with their circumstance. [The reason that people from the lower class fought each other were because opportunities were scarce. The Kims were of low class but as we saw, they could fall lower and it was this abyss that they were very much trying to avoid. And you could also argue that if the Kims had never opened the door for the former housekeeper, then part of their crisis could have been averted. However, their guilty conscious took over and they were punished for it.] I agree that all of characters are complex and full of flaws, but I hadn't stated otherwise in my short analysis.

In regards to the end I wouldn't have expected him to care about anyone else but his son who was having a seizure. I think that's fair.

> I mean they think their long time housekeeper has contracted TB, and they care nothing about her wellbeing -- they saw her only as a liability at that point, so she had to be removed from their privileged curated world.

I agree with this. On the flip side, Kim's family was doing diabolical shit to make her have ""TB"" and get fired.

the park clearly had a good night, while mr. kim lost so many of his belongings. this is why i think that sex scene was important, and that's why mr. kim makes the ""you must really love your wife"" comment to mr. park. that one was almost a scoff, and perhaps mr. park also sensed that his driver knew a little more than he should, and he felt that the line had been crossed.

when the old housekeeper's husband comes out of the basement on his killing spree, even after he gets stabbed, he yells ""CEO park, respect!!"" and mr. park just looks at him in disgust and plugs his nose while reaching for the keys. even though his son is literally having a seizure, and his wife freaking out, mr. park pulled a face and chose to plug his nose than just grab the car keys and run.

that's when mr. kim realised: no matter what, even if the drivers and maids give up their life for them, the upper class will find a way to keep them under their shoe. he yelled at mr. kim before. the smell of poverty could never be separated from their bodies.

When you have planned and failed over and over again, you grab onto any opportunity that arises as hard as you can and ride it for as much and as long as you can.

The important thing to get from this story, and one of the main messages Joon ho is trying to show is that in a society where the gap between the rich and the poor is so great as to make elevating from one to the other impossible, the real war is between those at the bottom.

Everybody in the movie is kind of a victim of the side effects of capitalism if you think about it.

Using the term ironically makes him feel smarter than the people who really believe that shit. And he also uses it to convince people he knows what he's talking about. Metaphor in art, for him, is another way to feel clever and get rich.

The joke, of course, is that he eventually becomes obsessed with the metaphor of the rock. And that's why he gets his skull smashed.

fayneat,"6) This is the bitter ending to the film. He's still so invested in this unattainable dream that he'll be able to rise up and become part of the elite class that he truly thinks it's possible.   

7) The husband refers to debt collectors always being able to find them (this is an after-the-film thought) during the movie I simply inferred that because she wasn't used to living on the streets / without a regular job she simply was a victim of homelessness etc.   

8) Upon a bit more reflection - she is a talented, intelligent individual. She is also able to rise to her position very quickly because of her quick wits. She sends out the maid, mom, etc, and deftly creates a job position that only she is qualified to take. Whether it's a combination of intuition, intelligence, or whatever else -- I think she is the embodiment of the ""American Dream"" -- that if you're clever enough, smart enough, able to come up with a good idea and run with it you can MAKE IT. The fact that she's the family's only casualty really sort of cements the idea as a whole... no matter how smart she was she was never going to climb the ladder, she was fucked regardless of how intelligent/skilled she was.   

9) I took away: madness. The fact that he was \*\*literally beaten over the head\*\* with this idea of ""hope"" in an attempt to kill him, he still had it. Thus the laughter. It doesn't make sense because it can't make sense. When the thing you wholly believe in is the tool of your destruction what other recourse is there but to laugh? This is a freshly formed thought so feel free to take it with one grain of small salt :)   

10) The whole idea of this man was that his life was controlled by the ruling class. He had no hope, he was complicit. Yes, debtors were coming after him, but his 'employer' allowed him to live a (really shitty) living and in return he would devote his life to his employer. He literally bowed his head into buttons that would make his employer feel more than human (lights turn on at his every step). It's trying to point out how humiliating the vast majority should fucking feel living in the basement of the world while the 1% enjoy the light.

fhuilat,"In what world could that kick down the stairs be seen as accidental? You could see the anxiety in Mrs Kim's  eyes, it was definitely intentional, a way for her to push Moon-Gweong back so she couldn't get to the Madame. 

Min gave Ki-Woo the job because he didn't see him as a serious contender or threat. This was stated in the film. Ki-Woo is flat-out willing to kill, and while the others may not be planning out murders, they carry out actions without regard to the safety of their victims. These actions could very well lead to death, whether intentional or not. The Kims did not care about the cafe worker or Yoon because they too are underclass. The Parks think Jessica is upperclass, given Ki-Woo's description of her and her education/demand. Ki-Woo himself was only invited because of his relationship with Da-Hye, and even then the invitation was lukewarm, an afterthought by the mother. Ki-Taek tries to establish a more personal relationship with Nathan, but is reprimanded by Nathan each time (at the party, Ki-Taek is coldly told to think of this party antic as part of his job when he speaks to Nathan about his personal life regarding the love he has for his wife. Nathan clearly values this distinct boundary between his employees acting as employees, not close members of the family or even friends). 

I will concede that the Kims manipulated and lied their way into the Park home. But what I love so much about this film is that I'm left with no anger towards the Kims for doing so. They do work hard, they are competent, they are skilled, but they do not have opportunity. They are desperate for a better life; aren't we all? Is their manipulation of other people that much different from how real-life folks also go to extreme measures to accrue wealth? Ki-Taek is shown to be an extremely skilled driver, Ki-Woo was recommended by Min for his skill, and although Ki-Jung faked her skill in art therapy, it is clear she is helping Da-Song with his misbehavior issues and cares for him. Choong-Sook is a competent housekeeper and good cook. 

I cannot see anyone in this film as an inherently terrible person. The Kims are guilty of being thrust into poverty from which they cannot escape through conventional means, so when they have a thread of a chance, they take it. Is it ethical? Perhaps not. Is it understandable? Absolutely. I believe you need to judge these characters within the context of their situation and environment. The Parks are guilty of cheating, albeit in a less obvious way (for example, when Madame paid Ki-Woo less than Min but claimed she paid more). They are guilty of a lack of empathy towards the underclass. They are not bad people, but they are ignorant. As Choong-Sook said, ""they are not nice and rich, they are nice because they are rich"". The Kims don't have the chance or the ability to care about being ""nice""; they're prioritizing their survival first.",dps3xy

> I think him attributing a lot of symbolism and meaning to things is supposed to come across as a teenager who thinks he's wiser than he really is (e.g. ""it's all so metaphorical!""). so he's effectively superstitious and shit, thinking the rock really is a gift that will bring prosperity to the family. Even after everything has gone to shit, he dreams that the rock floats up to him and won't let go of him, when in reality he can't let go of his family's get rich quick dream. Him going down to the basement with the rock is a continuation of the delusion that this rock is a gift from destiny, fating him towards good fortunes.

if you hadn't realized by now i'm a marxist, so i'm interpreting it through that lens. i see a lot of confusion from people on here about the details of the film, but i honestly thought it got dangerously close to beating you over the head with the message. i think showing ki-woo's superstitious nature undermining him serves to show the danger of idealism and mysticism, especially as it's embodied in commodity fetishism (with the rock), as opposed to a materialist understanding of reality. 

> they REALLY crossed the line (to their own eventual destruction) by getting the housemaid fired.

this is definitely part of it. i think there's more to be said about when chung-sook tells ki-jeong to bring food down to the basement people, right before she's distracted by yeon-gyo and ki-woo decides to go down there intending to murder them. they came so close to reconciliation and mutual understanding before everything went wrong.",dps3xy

The dad and son we're talking about if the driver is doing okay and they hope he is, but then she comes in and says, who cares about him, care about us, we matter more! I find it as a reflection of how selfish we have become as a society. It's not that we're evil and want to harm others. It's a feeling of insecurity and danger justifying us to only care about ourselves and who cares how many people we hurt and damage along our path.

I can buy into the idea of him snapping like that. 

  
Yes, I'm not surprised by Mr. Kim stabbing Mr. Park at all. He had just gone through the whole ordeal with the old housekeeper and that still being an unresolved issue. Then he has to stay hidden and be humiliated in front of his kids for the way he smells. Then when he finally gets out of that, he returns home to find that he doesn't have any home or really anything left. He's then forced to go to a shelter and sleep on the floor, and then his employer expects him to still work the next day and act in the stupid skit and holds it over his head that he basically has to because he's being paid more. Finally, he snaps because of the way that Mr. Park only cares about his child, and doesn't care that Mr. Kim's children are probably going to die. 

&#x200B;

> I do struggle with the son getting his head smashed in not only once but twice... if he survived that he should probably be in a vegetative state forever. I've seen the movie 3 times now and still love the whole finale but that part has bothered me every time. 

That didn't bother me until I read people complaining about it. It still doesn't bother me too much because the rest of the movie is so excellent.

f639dub,"There was foreshadowing about him coming to that realization.

When Mr. Kim is talking to the basement guy, he says ""How can you live like this?""

Basement guy retorts something along the lines of:

""What do you mean? Lots of people live in basements, *even more if you include sub-basements*""

He's oddly specific about sub-basements and in the moment it almost sounds like comic relief, meanwhile earlier in the film the daughter had described the scent as exactly that: *the scent of living in a sub-basement*",dps3xy
f63apkt,"I think a lot of people are seeing it as ""Mr. Kim killed him over that last smell gesture"" in a more direct way than it really seemed to go down

It was strongly implied all the smell gesture did was make Mr. Kim realize that he and the basement guy were in the same position. 

When he chats with basement guy and tries to look down on him for living in the bunker, basement guy even calls him out saying it's no different than living in a sub-basement (without knowing Mr. Kim lives in one)

*From there*, everything else about the situation is why Mr Kim kills Mr. Park. As they're no longer ""on the same team"", and now he's free to do that

And that's carried further with the symbolism in the ending. Mr. Kim ends up living in the basement. He's the one who buries the housekeeper. He's also hiding from powerful people looking for him on the outside. He becomes the new ghost, stealing food and sending messages with the lights in morse code.",dps3xy

fffcunb,"Thanks for the mention; I've posted so much in here that maybe I should make a text doc with a paragraph about ""why Mr. Kim hates his life"" and copy-paste it when needed.  ;-p

On top of what you quoted, I think Ki-taek's been feeling pressured since before the beginning of the movie.  In their basement apartment, their stuff looks like they had to move out of a bigger place not *that* long ago (there are still some unopened boxes, and they've got books strapped together as if they had to carry them but have not had a place to reorganize them).  He obviously used to drive often, whether he owned a car or worked as a delivery driver, because he drives pretty smoothly and ""knows his way around everywhere south of the 38th Parallel.""

But the very first tasks we see in the movie -- piggybacking off a neighbor's wifi, scoring a part-time job folding pizza boxes -- were thanks to his kids and NOT himself.  That's why, although he speaks with such positivity, he's quietly *seething* as he's folding boxes.  Think about it -- he had his own business a little while ago, but now his family is doing menial labor work while coughing in clouds of roach spray.

He's so on edge that he broke decorum and cursed at other drivers while driving Mr. Park home from work.  He also nearly snapped to the point of almost punching his wife.  Eventually, he was bound to crack and do something worse.

I think the accelerant (the fuse was already placed when he overheard the Parks speak badly about his family) was the last time he asked Mr. Park if he loved his wife and family.  Instead of expressing some humanity, like, ""You know, Mr. Kim, yes, I do, and I hope you can help me be a good father,"" he shuts him down and orders Ki-taek to just do it because he's paying him extra.

**The kicker is, all these inequities seem so normal to us now.**  Can't afford a good education, well, that's too bad, guess you gotta flip burgers; can't afford to get a lawyer to help manage your bankruptcy, well, that's too bad too, hope you aren't in debt with the Mob.  Another post in this thread was from a restaurant owner saying that it would be weird if one of his employees tried to ask personal questions about his family.  That kind of boss-employee separation is, in fact, what enables bosses to fire employees so easily.  The Parks fire their driver *and* their housekeeper with no actual evidence.  You'd think that they'd at least want to see a doctor's note about Moon-gwang's TB diagnosis, but no -- maybe they were too worried about their reputation, maybe they just refused to care, but either way, they dropped her like a hot rock.",dps3xy

fhr97m2,"That was probably one of the most sensical parts of the film for me. He reached his point of no return. Think of everything he endured leading up to that moment. The whole 'smell' related scenes. He was just another stinkbug to Mr Park, and was treated/spoken about as such. The whole night before the party, incredibly stressful and exhausting encounter with the old house keeper and basement husband, the fight, the flood, losing his home, staying in an overcrowded refuge for sufferers of the flood, not sleeping. Having to pretend nothing happened while driving the wife around running errands while she just yapped and yapped and yapped in privilege. Being told to wear an Indian costume because he's been told to, to be told to just get on with it because he's being paid more money, being dehumanised. 

Seeing his daughter get stabbed to death and then seeing Mr Park shouting at him as if he was an idiot for not helping them instead, seeing his son being carried off covered in blood. Seeing Mr Park react to the basement guys smell (relating back to Mr Park seeing those lesser than him as stinkbugs, remember the scene he flicks one away in their home at the beginning, it's foreshadowing).

The wrongest thing he does is look down on the Kims.
 
Looking down on people is shitty but pretty damn unimportant in the grand scheme. Making it so your poor family squanders and abuses every opportunity they get given and are stupid and drunken whenever unsupervised is far worse.

No. The movie is excellently acted and the cinematography is great but the writing is based on a string of contrivances. It certainly seems aware of the current growing mentality of Eat the Rich and is designed to tap that market but shows neither depth nor understanding of the inherent exploitation built into the system that the wealthy exploit and perpetuate. You effectively have to bring in a master class understanding of these elements to be able to construe it as anything but a commentary on impoverished people.

If there was a terrorist event, such as an active threat (ie several people being murdered), your first thought generally wouldn’t be of altruism but rather, to get your family out of there as soon as possible.

Also not to mention that the father himself left his dying daughter and his wife on the lawn. Regardless of what he thought was “best”, he still committed one last act of cowardice and ran off without attending to them like any redeemable character would.

Regardless of what anyone says about some pseudo-intellectual diatribe about classism and the “ignorance of the rich”, I cannot possibly dismiss active murder (or the intent to do so) as forgivable actions. People here go on about how the Kims were not meant to be “condemned” or “hated”, and yet, appear to freely excuse their actions as symptomatic of a “broken system”.

The more I've thought about it and read people's responses, the more it makes sense why he stabbed Mr Park.

The brain damage I think is meant to be symbolic of the whole class-aspiration theme. It's supposed to bring wealth and prosperity, but instead it nearly kills him. I think there's a dark joke in there about the ""happiness"" it brought him by damaging his brain so he laughs at everything.",dps3xy

f6dyl21,"I meant indie in the sense that it’s relatively unknown in the west and is more of an art house type of film - perhaps a poor choice of words. I regularly watch Bollywood films and similarly you have mainstream (masala) type films and other films like parasite that try and deliver a social message. 

This film is definitely more about the subtext and social commentary than the actual plot - a plot that is absolutely fine, by the way. The protagonist repeatedly says the phrase, “that’s metaphorical” as if to bash you over the head with the subtext that you’re missing. 

Looking at the “exciting” and “unexpected” plot, it was only the reveal that there was a guy living in the basement that was surprising. I’m sure the majority of the audience was expecting something to go wrong when the family was having too much fun in the house. After that, you could probably predict what was going to happen thereafter if you watch a lot of foreign films - except for the part where Mr Kim then hides in the basement, replacing the man that he killed. I thought that was a really nice touch. 

I’ll tell you why I think the movie was more about the imagery and subtext than the plot, the scene with the family hiding under the table. This wasn’t believable for me, but that doesn’t matter because the imagery is more important here. Shortly before, the dad is being called a cockroach, now he’s hiding under the table like one and later he slides/crawls away like one.",dps3xy
f6e0wrs,"Yeah, about the indie comment, what I meant was that most western audiences won’t have heard of him and the type of film isn’t exactly for a mass audience.

But it wasn’t just those claims though. It was also people saying, “this film had a profound impact on me and had me thinking days after”. People claiming to have seen the multiple times because it’s that good. So it makes me think, either they don’t watch a lot of movies - but if that was the case, would they chance their arm with a Korean one? Or, as I said in my original comment, it’s people basically taking the stance of rick and morty fans ie “if you don’t get this film, you’re stupid” and a section of those feeling as if they have to say they loved it, or risk being labelled uncultured. 

I also thought that other films told the class story better than this film, hence me asking if I missed something.",dps3xy

fbcwn7d,"To add onto everything you've said;

1) The scene prior to the party was of Mr. Kim speaking to Ki-woo and how the best plan is to never have a plan. Whatever happens, happens, that way nothing can go wrong even if you were to kill someone. Which is ironic because he does exactly that, he kills Mr. Park, right after Mr. Park described to him this elaborate plan for something as minor as the delivery of a cake. Humans will do the craziest things when pushed to the edge, especially when you have no plan or vision of how you want things to play out.

2) I think this has something to do with society's portrayal of good and bad. These people are some of the lowest of the low, doing whatever they can to survive, even if it's what is considered ""bad"" in society. Rich people tend to care more about self-image, because ""good"" looks equals success. As people who are fighting for survival everyday, all they want is a taste of the good life and once they get it, why would they care about their outward appearance? As to OP saying they didn't care for each other, I think that's completely false. Multiple times Ki-woo talks about getting a university degree or doing something with his life to make his parents proud. The entire time they're trying to make money for each other. He easily could have just done the job himself, gone to university and lived completely apart from his family. Ki-Jung has many redeeming qualities, she is the one most fit to escape this lifestyle. The only reason she isn't able to use her talents is because of her lifestyle, instead of using her talents for ""good"" (aka to help society) she has to use it to use them in a ""bad"" (aka for herself) way to survive.

3) As you said, they committed fraud but also their family member who was in on the fraud committed murder and has disappeared. Who's to say they aren't in on the murder?

4) The Park family was never the main characters. There's no scene in the movie where it is solely the Park family. To give closure to a family that is essentially just an obstacle to the Kim family, who are the real main characters, would be silly. Also, I think this is another contrast between the rich and the poor. The rich can just move away and try their hardest to start anew, forgetting their past, completely moving on (of course it's not that easy, but the option is there). While, the poor cannot. They must live through their hardships.
I also don't see the daughter's ""love"" for Ki-woo as real ""love"" but a cry for attention. In most cases parents tend to care more and avert of their attention for their youngest child. The Park's are trying their hardest to make Da-song's life as perfect as possible after the incident he had. But, what about the daughter? Where's her attention? Her ""love"" affairs between both, Ki-woo and Min are cries for the attention and love she lacks from her parents. Other than getting a tutor, they do nothing for her. Lastly, once revealed that they were all a family, would you really go back to the person who's father just killed your own father?

I would say most of these scenes added importance and meaning to the movie. Whether it's the rash decision making of the father because he fails to plan leading to the absolute demise of his family, the continued contrast between the rich and the poor with something as simple as the use of alcohol or showing that the rich life doesn't necessarily mean the good life. Just cause the daughter can have any material she wants, where's the fundamentals we need as humans, like love?",dps3xy
fbd7kfg,"1) So did you stab your boss when she told you about her vacation plans? lol See this is where the climactic murder is a problem for me. I completely agree that the Parks were disrespectful of the Kims in terms of not wanting to engage in social chatter and that they were unaware of their employees’ plight but it just comes out of left field. Prior to the scene of finding out that Mr. Kim smells, do you think that Mr. Kim wanted to murder Mr. Park? This is why I have a problem, where the only motivation for the murder of Mr. Park would be displacement of anger due to his home flooding & Park’s disgust of smell. 

2) lol No, I have some problems with Bong Joon Ho’s films but overall he creates interesting films even if I’m not the biggest fan of them. 

3) They are charged and convicted of fraud and several other crimes, but we the audience are never shown the prosecution’s argument. Because honestly all he did was claim to be going to a university, and all the mother did was lie about her name, assuming she lied since the previous housekeeper told her husband the poor mom’s name with her dying breath. 

4) Love subplot, romance subplot, sex subplot. Let’s not get bogged down in semantics. Love subplot is a widely used term so I called it that. I don’t know if she was neglected or if she was just going through the distant teenager phase. Eitherway I think it’s correct to just call her a horny teenage girl who wanted to kiss boys who were around her. I would agree that I’d expect her to be distraught, upset, angry and so on but the fact that we never get to see their reaction to the truth was what I found so jarring about their absence.",dps3xy

femt9ma,"I don't think (anymore) that she's a druggie.  It's been often suggested that her talk about drugs while on the couch was her pretending to be the prostitute that they believed their driver had slept with  -- so they were fetishizing how poor people have risky sex in parked cars (which the Kims can't afford to do; but that's another branch in the plot).

I think she's sleeping in the front yard because she can afford to be that lazy.  Plus, it shows that she's mostly useless for running the house, so she's likely to be just a trophy wife, married for her good looks over anything else.  (contrast that with the Kims, all four of whom need to work just to put food on the table)

It also shows that the yard is so much safer and more pleasant than the street in front of the Kims' apartment window.  And yes, the way it's shot (as mentioned in another comment) shows Moon-gwang crossing a visual line when she controls Mrs. Park instead of the other way around.",dps3xy

It felt like the movie wanted to make it seem like equal people in different situations but it felt incredibly unfair for the rich family. They didn’t even give any resolution to the rich wife and son as far as I know. She fainted and the son had a seizure and that’s it. They showed the wife as being inept and her breadwinner was killed so there’s no reason to think she’ll continue her lifestyle so she’s probably out of luck too. They were rich but I don’t think enough that she can live off what was left after he died.

fhwx3x5,"> so he's not necessarily parentally inclined to begin with

Yeah good point, I actually agree with this one.

> Park running back up the stairs, sealing the door, and calling the cops

Tbf, if I find out some random dude has been living in my basement for *four years* without my knowledge and has threatened the privacy and security of me, my family, and the safe space I call home, I would be doing the same regardless of the context.

I think it's unreasonable to expect anyone to act differently and therefore ridiculous to judge someone as elitist based on *how receptive one would be to a stranger leeching off one's home without consent*. It doesn't mean you're a shit person just because you do not show outright compassion to this creepy man in your house. These comments on Reddit saying Mr. Park was out of line for reacting the way he did is something I just do not agree with. Just imagine an incident like this in America, even with a middle class family. TL;DR if this happened irl, it's fair that anyone would freak out. 

It just happens that in the case of Mr. Park, he's also an elitist. The smell/disgust thing was funny imo (but also a nice touch) because it showed his true colors even in the face of mortal danger. I was like ""dude, that's what you're concerned with? Gtfo of there!"". Overall, I would argue that the actions of Mr. Kim *in that particular moment* is still the one out of line, not Mr. Park's. The points of class struggle/ social divide is another discussion.",dps3xy
fhwhie5,"I'm not denying what triggered Mr. Kim wasn't valid. He was clearly shown that he was on the edge as early as when he was running errands with the madam. That part was OK. I'm saying whatever his reason was, that feels nothing when you have a dying child on your hands needing immediate medical attention.

Mr. Kim's reaction was very different from Mr. Park even if they were both fathers whose children were in danger. They both understandably lost their shit but Mr. Kim responded more to his anger towards Mr. Park rather than attending to his children - which isn't believable. 

Take the madman for example, he was trapped in a basement without light and much air, was tied up overnight, and watched his wife die. Of course he's gone mad. Mr. Kim on the other hand, his children were still alive, albeit in very grave danger. It would be a different story if the children died instantly or if he went back to attending to them after stabbing Mr. Park. Him fleeing the scene and just leaving his children there was my issue.",dps3xy

Because in my opinion the “villains“ are clearly the poor family since they are shown as the “parasites“ since the beginning ( movie starts with them living in a basement and have to use the wifi of surrounding places, showing their first parasite behavior)

They are desperate but that doesnt give them the right to go this far, especially since they had other options to work honestly with the english teaching job and the pizza place. Not much but its a start and its shown that these people have some skills, so they could find honest jobs but instead ruined several lifes of innocent people.

Ki-jeong had earned her position in the Park household as Da-Song's art teacher, and her getting stabbed at the end just adds to the irony that the only one who genuinely earned their place was murdered. This kinda contributes to the sad realization that Ki-woo would never be able to afford the Park house through hard work, because even the hard-workers in society don't necessarily win.  Additionally, while Ki-Jeong lays dying, Park expects Ki-Taek to abandon his daughter and take Da-song to the hospital which again shows how the dominant group in power (the rich) divides and conquers the subordinate group (the poor) and expects them to stay subservient.",dps3xy

The horror movie US did a really similiar thing in a different way, but the message was mostly the same - People who are privileged or rich are ignorant to the plights of the lower class (in US it was a metaphor for the prison system, but same point really). 

Even though you’re rooting for the protagonists in that film you also can’t help but feel empathy & understand ‘the others’ & their motives because their quality of life just wasn’t as good.

ff45zk2,"In recent years? No. There have been some documentaries but never ones that had huge followings. or I think even got into big festivals. Hollywood is typically quite cynical about the lower classes and people are regularly depicted in ways that are actually outdated. When there is a film that specifically discusses poverty they are typically about a child and done in a way to garner sympathy for a child while simultaneously villainizing a parent. Moonlight, Florida project, I,Tonya — they all fit into this dynamic. Even these are extremely far and few. The ones not done in this way are typically black comedies that tend to simultaneously have sympathy for the poor, stereotype them and a ton of pessimism towards them such as parasite. 

There is a musical coming out about illegal immigrants that may be promising, but I anticipate it will do the typical “good poor” vs. “bad poor” that most films attempting to talk about systematic oppression wind up doing. Or it will pit poor groups against each other. We’ve seen this dynamic in films about oppression and poverty since the color purple where the men of color were villainized while the women depicted as heroic. Films that don’t include poverty but seek to discuss other forms of oppression tend to focus on a middle class character such as get out, blackkklansmen, etc. There isn’t a film in recent memory that isn’t a documentary that points a finger outside of the lower class while not also pointing a finger at the lower class. I would say the last popular movie that represented impoverished characters without having that dynamic towards the poor that I can recall was rent. 

Given rent happened before the Great Recession it’s really quite fascinating that poverty isn’t discussed more. You would think there would have been a lot of movies about it. I think we live in a time where it’s a little faux pax to talk about poverty as a separate systematic oppression and so creators feel a need to establish a “balance” by introducing pessimism because they feel it will alienate a large part of their audience if they don’t, but they end up relying on stereotypes as a result.",dps3xy

3. Mrs.Kim (mother of the poor family) was a professional athlete.

Also, when their house flooded, Mr.Kim goes back inside to get his wife’s trophy, because it’s a symbol of her determination and dedication. 

Being an athlete is certainly not a task for a lazy person.... but you know, shit happens in life, and even if you were once an aspiring law student married to a professional athlete who gave birth to some pretty smart and attractive kids, you could find yourself down in the ghettos, living in an underground shack, driving around a rich guy and cleaning his house for a living.

I definitely took that to mean that she should count it as a lesson so would be paid for it.",dps3xy
fict0ja,"I think you're being overly critical of the Parks they weren't saints but they weren't awful either. It seems like you really didn't like them and that's making you interpret things more negatively than they were. For instance hiring ""Jessica"" wasn't about passing of responsibility of raising a kid. Ki-jung made Mrs. Park believe her son was traumatized and had psychological issues she could help him with through art since she had experience in the field as a therapist and an artist and he comunicated through his paintings. Mrs. Park was hiring someone she believed to be a profesional to help her son deal with his issues. That's normal.

I took the shrimp comment as a self deprecating joke, a small jab at herself or something. ""You know my culinary skills"" (you know I can't cook for shit so I'm paying x).

Might be a translation issue but according to our subtitles she was asking ""Jessica"" if she could come to the birthday party, take it as another session and she would pay it as extra hours.

> she lied to “Kevin” and said she’s paying him more, when in fact she removed some cash from the envelope beforehand

I think she informed Ki-woo of this though, after the interview she said he wasn't as prepared as the previous teacher so she would pay him less or something like that. After the class she was impressed so she gave it back plus a little extra. I would have to watch it again though, I don't remember this part that much.

> And they didn’t try to get any medical care for their longtime housekeeper but instead, they fired her with no legitimate evidence.

I don't think you're supposed to pay for other people's medical treatments, it would be nice but it's not an obligation that makes you an ass if you don't fullfil it. If I had the money I would have given the employee some extra to help her with the expenses but I definitely wouldn't have kept her in my house. I mean it's TB... That can be fatal and there's a small child in the house.

Wasn't the evidence Mr. Kim's testimony? He said he heard her tell someone she has TB and then showed Mrs. Park a bloody rag. That sealed it.

I don't think it was a story about good and bad guys. Everyone was at least a little gray but some were definitely darker than others. It may be due to cultural differences or something but over here the Kim family was perceived as the darker ones. 
There were the usual groans of disapproval in the theater but as the Kim's progressed with their scheme the murmurs grew louder until you could tell few if any were on their side. They didn't get some sympathy until the flood happened and even then it wasn't that much. The Kim's were honestly leaches that took from everyone around them (rich and poor) if it benefited them. I live in a third world country, people here work hard for what they have, you're gonna find it really difficult to get people to feel bad for someone who would steal their job in order to scam their bosses.

I did still feel bad for them. They screwed both families but Mr. Kim seem to repent for what he did and I just don't like suffering I guess.",dps3xy

I don't believe her. Think back to when they're in the basement and the former housekeeper (who was fired because of the actions her own family) was begging to be allowed to keep her husband alive and was even willing to pay her for that, and she acted all high and mighty to threaten to call the police.  


People in my opinion can most be judged for their character depending on how they behave in a situation when they have the upper hand. Mrs. Kim had all the power in that moment and could have chosen to quietly cooperate with the former housekeeper, the least she could have done considering she had stolen her job, but instead she behaved like she was too fucking good for them.  


What that tells me is that it's a load of crap what she's saying, if Mrs. Kim was rich she would be just as bad or even worse than Mrs. Park.",dps3xy

Just my two cents. I think this movie deserved all the praise it got",dps3xy

Symbolic of how we cut each others throats for scraps and think it's all sunshine and daisies but it's often at the expense of others. For example the Driver and housekeeper were fired based on lies and we are only watching from one family's perspective. So it's all fun and daisies, but then when you here that doorbell ring things change. The perspective of others creeps in.

You dont think about the family of the house keeper they got fired or the driver.

The Dad started to think about it when they were all getting drunk. He said, I wonder if the old driver got another job. He must have right?

Then the daughter gets mad as fuck and yells dont worry about them. Only worry about us. 

That's the attitude of most humans in the world and it's very sad.

fincym2,"Mrs Parker for example. Yeah, she was always silly but nice at the same time (like Poor Mom said). Then she turns into a bossy rich woman ordering everyone (including her husband) around, with her leg on the bolster, hanging on the phone all day.

Main character - fixated on ""advancing"" - suddenly starts to wonder if he fits there (and possibly wants to pass the lucky stone to the basement guy). When the Park girl asks if he's heading to the crowd he says that he goes even lower, meaning he wanted to go back to the beginning. Then we have the laughing disorder that magically disappears and he's back to dreaming about being rich again. 

MC's dad says that he doesn't know why he killed Mr Parker. Indeed, as a viewer I don't know either. He was touched by his opinion about his smell, yes, but in a different way. It made him sad rather than angry and the scene before, when he and his wife faked an argument was kind of confirmation that he's not ""violent"" type.",dps3xy

Not worried at all about his employee bleeding to death and leaving her to die. The kind of rich person who makes his employee do degrading things because they are getting paid to do their job. The final straw was when he held his nose up litterally at the smell which broke Mr. Kim.

Their plan failed mainly because the Kims fucked up their plan on their own, by celebrating together in the Parks' mansion and providing a chance for other people to discover they were actually a family and were frauds.

While it's true that ""society is stacked against them"", this wasn't the main reason why they failed during the course of the movie. The main reason was they didn't have the mentality to resist the temptation to go to the mansion altogether.

It was Moon-gwang's husband who killed Ki-Taek's daughter. It was Moon-gwang's husband who bashed the head of the son. Ki-Taek saw it. Ki-Taek knew it. 

It was their competitor (in-host parasitic competitor - another parasite already living inside the host) who was responsible for such a great loss to the Kim family. 

His daughter didn't die because of the Parks. His son didn't get his head bashed because of the Parks. Ki-Taek knows it. 

His primary hatred & agony should be towards the downright villain in this situation i.e. the mad psychotic killer Moon-gwang's husband.

At the most, in his hate for the Parks, he could have punched Mr. Park hard on his face.

CARRY THE DAUGHTER IN HIS ARMS IMMEDIATELY TO RUSH TO THE HOSPITAL.

fhaqw95,"it’s a critique on the system, not the people.

The people act like how they’re supposed to act based on what the system forces them to. 

It shows the very nature of people, they care about their own survival and worries first, before they worry about other people.

It’s shown a few times, like when they force out the housekeepr and driver, the talk while they we’re squatting in the house when the rich family went camping, the interaction between the family and their ex-housekeeper + husband, and when their house was flooded with their neighbors crying for their help but they rushed to their house first, etc.

The movie shows that the rich aren’t intentionally mean or bad, but that they are leeching of the poor’s labor and clueless to their plight. They seem to be good people, but only because they don’t have to worry about survival, and would only tolerate the poor as long as they don’t cross the lines.

The litmus test that shows that the rich are just the same as the poor was during the chaos at the end, where Mr. Park ignored everything else and just wanted to save his son, and even then he still couldn’t treat the poor as equals.",dps3xy

fem8u3p,"> The questioning is really relevant because it highlights the divide between classes between characters. Mr Park is unwilling or incapable of communicating with Mr Kim on such a deep, emotional level because the two aren’t equals.

This is how people make a shallow movie deeper by pulling stuffs like that. 

Its not a divide of classes! Its a basic civic sense & etiquette. Even if Park had made a new acquaintance, colleague or social/business contact of equally rich class, one can't ask such questions unless they are close as good friends.

And its not about class, its about employee-employer relationship. An employee can't ask such question unless in rare case if he happens to be very good friend (drinking together & stuffs) with the employer. 

Ki-Tae would've been clearly aware of this fact as he was smart. He have seen the world and knew very well how to lie, con, frame, emotionally motivate people. He would have realised that he crossed the line. 

Its a bad writing. To justify his actions, a good writer would have characterised Ki-Tae as naïve, emotional and timid right from the beginning and as the weakest member of the family not smart enough as other members. Your explanation would have then fallen fit in that case.",dps3xy

fh9ghaw,"Adding onto what Tb313 said, there was, in my opinion, a lot of buildup to the moment when the ""smelly father"" decided to kill Mr. Park.

Even back when their house was being flooded, what does the son save? That rock, rumored to bring them wealth. He then asks his father if he has a plan, to which the father replied that life is essentially better without a plan. That it's unpredictable, from one moment one could be living a perfectly happy life, the next they could be sleeping in a gym- or for all we know, dead.

The ""smelly father"" knows that his family is living on the edge, and throughout the movie there are a lot of references to the stench of the poor.

Even on the explicit-ish scene with the husband and his wife on the couch, they're talking smack about this smell of the poor as they bang and have fun.

and what was Mr. Park's last action before he was stabbed?

Sniffing a set of keys that he pulled from beneath the back of a smelly, dead ""homeless"" man. And wrinkling his face up in disgust.

the idea that the rich get wealthier off the backs of the overworked poor, the ""stench"" that they have, the way that the rich could never understand the poor (scene where Mr. Park and ""smelly father"" were in Indian garb, he mentions his pay, because that's all he can understand in the ""smelly father,"" that he's concerned about his next paycheck), it's all over the movie's scenes.

honestly, i'm surprised i didn't catch onto the fact that this death was coming- it made me audibly go ""wha?"" when i watched it in theaters

The genius of Bong Joon-ho's story, with all of this narrative buildup and the hidden messages he has, it's really masterfully done in this movie. There's so many more themes that are in this movie, the idea of familial love, double lives, even the kids of Mr. Park I feel have some kind of deeper narrative purpose and symbolism.

For me, I found myself liking the Kim's immensely. They are family-oriented, resourceful, intelligent, witty. But none of this excuses their exploitative behavior and their callous treatment of everyone outside of family. 

They give plenty of reason to like them, and plenty of reason to treat them how they treat others.",dps3xy

It's 100% about how demeaning poverty is, no matter how well meaning the rich people you interact with are.

Almost everyone I talked to felt so disappointed by that scene until the revelation that it was only a fantasy.

I wondered how they found a house that was so perfectly suited to the movie, but of course it’s perfect.

I was more surprised about the Kims’ neighborhood being built as a complete set on a studio lot.  I’ve been in areas exactly like that, and it seemed completely plausible.  I should have suspected that it was a set when it got flooded — they wouldn’t ruin a real, living neighborhood just for a movie, right? — but by that point, I wasn’t even thinking about how they made the movie.

In my mind, considering they had just swindled the Park family and were in the midst of trashing their house, coupled with trapping two people in the basement, it almost seems like some sort of punishment. And when they get home the emphasis on the window being open as if it’s their own fault (though I doubt it would have mattered), and the shit spewing out of the toilet out of control, paralleling the situation at the house.

Kevin’s plan is to get enough money to become wealthy so his dad doesn’t have to do any of the hard work of climbing the social hierarchy himself. The dad would be able to simply “walk” up to the upper class instead of scheme, fight, murder and suffer like they did during the plot.

I think what the movie is implying is that only the rich can give others an easy path to wealth, which is why Kevin needs to get rich himself first. For that, he needs a plan, but plans never work out.

It’s basically a catch 22. You either try to climb up and get thrown back down, or you stay at your level. For the Kim family, they took that risk and lost their father, daughter and half a brain.",dps3xy

fipahyu,"They don't throw money away needlessly? Yet they plan a hugely lavish impromptu birthday party for their child complete with professional chefs and caterers? I get the celebration is partly for their son's benefit, but all that additional opulence certainly wasn't. To me, they don't seem conservative with their money, but what they are is stingy with paying for anything that is not for their immediate satisfaction. They buy real native-american arrows for their son (supposedly) and a huge camping tent from the US, but the mom still discretely takes money out of the envelop for their daughter's tutor (also a statement on their favouritsm). 

They don't really take that great care of their possessions either. Not only do they not notice the significant depletion of their booze after the Kims have a blast, they didn't even realise that there was an additional mouth being fed in their household. The same also goes for the new rich family that moves in later.

In real life, I see that as the case too. Rich people being stingy in some situations doesn't mean they're not sometimes wasteful/excession with their spending. Everyone enjoys a respite from discipline now and then; it's just that by their very ability to do so, a treat for the Parks is a mountain compared to a treat for the Kims. Whether waste is to be calculated proportionate to one's income or not is a different matter.

Mr. Kim even said that with their combined incomes they could now do much better. But they don't. There are no plans. Just as Mr. Kim said. Even if they had money, I doubt anything would have changed. They wouldn't know what to do with it.

For the Kims, the question is what they could have done differently. The flood is a metaphor for their reactivity and inability to prepare. They do not batten down the hatches. They leave their windows open during monsoon season (not that it would have made a difference to close them, but the point stands). There's so much evidence that they do not do their due diligence. If you're poor and have little, but mismanage it, how are you going to manage being rich?

It's okay to criticize them. They were the main characters and highly sympathetic and likable. But they were objectively terrible people. All of your choices put you exactly where you are. This theme places Kevins laughing into perspective. It explains why he's laughing at his dead sister. Because cheaters get fucked. And the bigger you cheat the more fucked you get.

Accurate assumption, I think.  Home ownership and rentals in Korea are different enough that I still don't understand how they work (something like, you pay in advance for two years of tenancy).  Even here in the US, breaking an apartment lease comes with a financial penalty that most tenants couldn't withstand, even more so if they're scraping by like the Kims were.

Like I said, I went along with the Kims and saw her as an obstacle — at least until we watched her walk away with so much sadness.  Then I started to wonder where she could go, because she suddenly didn’t look like the respected professional that she had been ten minutes earlier.

Later, after the basement reveal, she was simultaneously:

- a parasite living off the scraps she could skim from the Parks
- a falsely accused victim of the Kims’ schemes
- the person who had the most legitimate claim to being household staff (virtually appointed by the original owner and architect)
- desperately protecting her husband
- the ticking bomb who could put the Kims in jail
- at risk of being sent to jail by the Kims

So I had all kinds of mixed feelings about her and her husband.  I didn’t want them to ruin the Kims’ plans*, but I didn’t think they deserved to be thrown out on the street, either.

Good eye, and I think that's a big reason I've forgotten about (because of course -- if the cops started asking questions, what could the Kims possibly say?).

At that moment, though, remember that the Parks had already planned for the rain (they took their rain gear to go camping) so they weren't expected to come home early.  And if they tried to ignore Moon-gwang, who knows what she would have done -- call the cops herself, or make a scene and disturb the neighbors, or sit there until morning.  The Kims of course didn't know about any bunker, only the pantry -- so if they let her into the downstairs pantry, she couldn't do much harm, right?

So between forcing her to stay outside versus letting her in, the least worst option was to let her in.  Once inside, she could be supervised; and because she said that she just forgot one small thing, it shouldn't take very long.",dps3xy

Emulating Japan would be odd for a Korean today (I asked my wife about if we move to live near her parents in Korea, should we also take our Honda cars?

fekq2pf,"...they’re in a position where they’re all unemployed, can’t afford wifi, are eating moldy food, invite “free” fumigation, basically are pissed on every weekend. I’m surprised that you came away with the impression that they were happy pre-Parks. They were surviving, and they still had each other, sure. But we clearly see Ki-taek’s insecurity at being unable to provide for his family, the children’s skills and talents going to waste because there are no jobs, and the resentment that slowly builds. I think once they see how the rich live, they dare to dream about it. Wealth doesn’t buy happiness, but it surely buys off many of the struggles of poverty. 

I don’t think they would have been happier being super rich or anything, or that that should be anyone’s goal. But that extremely stark divide - between the Parks, who want for nothing, and the Kims, who can’t even find work despite being qualified, who sit around folding pizza boxes because there is literally no other way for them to survive - “struggling to make ends meet” doesn’t really capture the sense of hopelessness inherent in that situation.

fom3emh,"(edit!  I wrote the following thinking you were referring to the basement couple... sorry!)
They’re not financially well off at all.

Geun-se didn’t make it into college, which is why he’s been studying for the public service exam (those are law books in the bunker).  He’s probably never going to pass it, either, so he tried running a cake shop (just like Mr. Kim did), but that failed, too — which is why he owes a lot of money to loan sharks now.

Moon-gwang has always been a servant, at least as far we know.  She works for the Parks simply because she had been recommended by her previous boss, who was the architect and former owner of the house (Bong suggested that he’ll fill in their relationship in the HBO series).  But after she’s fired, she has nowhere to go, no nest egg of cash, no other home or friends to lean onto.

Moon-gwang may dress nicely, but she has to — that’s her “work uniform” so she can fit in with the household.

fh4z3kv,"Yet all the rich people also scattered like cockroaches at the stabbing... And there were continual materialist references to them abusing the fruits of other people's labour (Mr Kim carrying stuff, the boxes of toys, the American stuff, the gifts for the party). The idea is that both are parasites imo...",dps3xy
fguwnl9,"I think if you take it one step further then it's possible to see both of them as parasites, with society being the host. It's stated, and shown, that the Parks really couldn't function as a unit without the ability to hire somebody to manage the day to day maintanence of driving to work, tutoring, and housecleaning. How long had the original housekeeper been fired, a week maybe, and Mrs. Park is shown having a hell of a time attempting to keep the house in order.

So the way I see it is that the Kims are a financially-dependent parasite, while the Parks are a primarily labor-dependent (because they have enough finances to not have to worry more about it) parasite. Without money, which the Kims attempt to take from the Parks' pool of it, the Kims are more than likely to starve at worst or find themselves on the street at best (while also noting that they were somewhat managing to scrape by with the pizza box making and an implied assortment of odd jobs). On the other hand, the Parks' sense of order and happiness, what both families want, would quickly crumble without the subservience of the Kims. 

They aren't equal however, the Parks would have the money to learn how to live without help. The Kims already don't have a lot of money and they need a consistent source of it to get by. Do they have enough to get by day to day at the beginning of the film, yes. Enough to live a full happy and healthy life? Absolutely not. But it's not a direct result of the Parks having the money per se. It's a direct result of the host, which is what has to be disproportionately nourishing both of the families if we consider them parasites, not giving out the right amount of sustenance (happiness/money) to both parasites. Say the host is a cow, the Parks have found themselves on the juiciest roll of fat on the entirety of the cow. While the Kims have found themselves on an ear or the tail, constantly hanging on for dear life while getting all that they can manage. Did they get where they each respectively are through hard work or just sheer luck? The movie doesn't say. 

Ultimately what my takeaway is, is that both families are just doing what they do to attempt to have a healthy and happy life. The Kims did some terrible things throughout the story, but they are indeed blinded to it by the need to find themselves content with their lot. But by them being on the ear or tail, they can't. They're just hanging on for a continued chance at a good life. The Parks have found the ideal spot on the cow and don't see a reason to look anywhere else, because the cow has always taken care of them, so why wouldn't it take care of someone else. And to be honest, most people, whether they started on the fat roll or the tail, when they find themselves on the fat, wouldn't see a reason to look elsewhere either. That's just how the cow is built. 

If we want equal sustenance, we've gotta find a different host to get by on. Edit: Or find/make enough space on the cow to get everyone a spot where they can all have enough to get and be satisfied by.",dps3xy

fnme6em,"While I still agree the parks have some problem in this I disagree with some of your comment.

1.saying that's how our society functions is a very broad generalization (black and white thinking) Sometimes the sick and hungry are their complete own faults (in America there are significant amounts of obese people because of their own habits) (also people who hang at the welfare net their whole life leeching off people-they don't improve) at their own fault and sometimes the rich are greedy/only fuck people over for money

Their are some genuine cases where people and homeless do need help. Not denying that at all but my main issue is when people start thinking they can do anything just cause they are in a bad state.

2. You don't have to be rich or poor to be nice or a piece of garbage. Should a homeless person be allowed to murder a rich person just because he has more money or take his home? Well what if that rich person started out more poor than him and worked his way up (had it harder)? What if the homeless person in this situation started middle class and ended up gambling his money down the drain and he just didn't want to work/face his inner problems but his excuse was he couldn't find a job.

Vice versa there can be rich people who get in there because of luck and think that homeless people can just fix their problem by working harder and that's not the case a lot of times. Some people genuinely get fucked up real bad and it's not their fault. For someone to say ""just work harder"" is a slap in the face 


To summarize the point I'm making is it's not black and white thinking. You can be kind when you are poor or rich and try your best to work around a situation.

I don't think just because you are poor gives you an entitlement to ruin other people's lives vice versa (you'd be just as bad as the rich people who are ruining other's lives)  being rich doesn't mean you know about the complex economic situation of all poor people.",dps3xy

The movie is twisting it, and viewing it in a lens of who ""deserves"" it imo is completely missing the point.

You mention that the mother and daughter were willing to attempt and help the basement people so it could be inferred the son thinks the same, but I think the talk the son had with his father changed his perspective. The son was the only one to hear his father's ""plan"".

Also, the son held the rock extremely tightly as if he was about to use it as a weapon. If he simply wanted the give the rock the basement people then why didn't he leave it when it falls down the steps? There would be no reason for him to retrieve it unless he had other intentions.

The way he talks to his ""gf"" is also ominous as if he has his mind set on finishing the job and killing the basement people.

While watching the scene a second time I once again got the feeling he was going down to kill the basement people. Why would he be sneaking down the stairs if he wanted to help the basement people? He was clearly trying to be quiet and get down the stairs without the basement people hearing him. 

The only time which he shows he might be trying to help the basement people is when he sees the housekeeper laying on the ground. His perspective seems to change and he seems in shock. Although he had probably imagined going down and killing them both, actually doing it is a different story. 

Also, when talking to his father while laying in his bed that night, he tells his father that he's sorry and that he will ""fix everything"".

fjbcp8c,">Hope is the emotional parasite in the film: the thing that keeps us going but sucks our marrow dry. 

This is from a [Vulture article](https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/parasite-ending-explained-by-bong-joon-ho.html) featuring some insight from Bong Joon-ho himself.

Your take about the film being somewhat of a cautionary tale about ambition is close to that quote. However, it's more of about the dangers of hope for the lower class.

Unlike Geun-se who lived in a windowless basement, the Kim family lived in a semi-basement with a window. The window here may be a symbol of the Kim family's opportunity to see and aspire to live the upper class life. Meanwhile, in his windowless abode, Geun-se did not have that opportunity. He had no plans for advancement and was content with switching the lights on for the Park family.

The movie ending with that downwards pan from the window to Ki-taek dreaming away hammers down the notion that he's hopeful. But as Bong Joon-ho states in that same article, ""we all know that this kid isn’t going to be able to buy that house."" So, whether they kill or work for their place in high society, a position in the upper class is still out of reach.

As for Ki-jeong, she seemed to have the skills to make it and intuitively ""fits in"" with the rich folk. I take it that her death is like a message that even if you have the merit and can easily blend in, you still won't make it to the top of the ladder.",dps3xy

That's the point of no return, and that's where they let their greed really take over. Consider also how they get rid of the first housekeeper - she was severely allergic, they could have killed her then and there with their little trick. But they just don't give a fuck.

His hope is light, it floats above the shit(-water). It defies reality. In the end he puts it down in a stream, where one could say it will slowly be eroded over many, many years... I guess when he finally gets close to death he'll realize his dream of freeing his father is just as impossible as a floating mf'in rock. Anyway, the latter half of this paragraph wasn't something I thought about. I really need to watch the film a few more times.

THAT SAID -- hope (the rock) can't kill him. The fact that it causes him to have brain surgery - with a temporary side effect of laughing at everything (suggestions of 'madness' here). In the end his hope (the rock) leaves him right where he started... but with less. He climbed a grand total of 0 (my my count maybe -1 or -2) rungs on the social ladder.

Quick Edit:The fact that it's so heavy and that it takes him both hands to hold, move, etc and how closely he always holds it to himself is almost definitely showing how powerful it is.

It takes generational effort to move a family from lower social class to higher, the poor family in the movie tried to take a shortcut but once confronted by something that not part of their plan they messed up.
Also i hate social commentary movie like this because they always raised questions but never provide a hint that things can be fixed. I just feel awful after watching.

Now, in the American TV show Malcolm in the Middle, the character who grew up relatively middle class to a type of poorness by some standards knew he could reach his personal and financial goals through education and intellect; the disparity between mind-sets and actual opportunity based on place and culture hit home on so many levels.",dps3xy

Remember that right after Kim stabbed Park, for a moment, he was in a daze, looking around at the people running, his son being carried off, and his daughter dying on the ground, when he snapped out of it and ran out of the yard and down the stairs.  He had simply snapped when he saw Park be so selfish as to take the only car for himself and not even try to get the other wounded people out of the house (the main threat, Geun-se, was dead by that point, so Park had no good reason to *not* evacuate the others).

A couple minutes earlier, when Kim and Park were hiding in the bushes to prepare their surprise, Park seemed happy to be organizing this bit of entertainment.  Kim, hoping to be included in this act of fatherly love, commented, ""You really love your family,""... but rather than respond with a Hollywood-washed, ""Yeah, Mr. Kim, I really do,"" Park turns cold and tells him, effectively, ""You're not here as a friend, you're still my driver, and I'm still your boss -- do what I tell you and that's it, capiche?""  **That's the door to the upper class being slammed in Kim's face.**

Earlier that day, fresh from finding borrowed clothes at the basketball arena-turned-refugee shelter -- and *maybe* getting a shower in the locker room -- Kim is nearly ignored by Mrs. Park as she has him drive all over town for expensive groceries and wine, treating him like a man-servant mule as she yammers on the phone with her friends about getting day-drunk and singing operatic sonnets in their rain-shower-freshened front yard.  Zero knowledge about the disaster at the bottom of the hill -- because **the Parks spend their money to stay uphill and actively maintain their ignorance**.

The night before, during their little party in the Parks' living room, the Kims pretty much agree that rich people are always nice.  Mr. Kim even shows a little humanity by wondering if the former driver and housemaid were able to score new jobs -- perhaps a mistaken assumption, though, as he seems to think that they were well-off already, being so close to the Parks by proximity alone.  But then Moon-gwang comes back, and the Kims see that she and her husband are actually even worse off -- and that the Parks simply *did not care* about what happened to their maid.  They discarded her like a moldy loaf of bread.  And that sentiment was driven home when the Kims were stuck under the table (like cockroaches) and had to listen to the Parks not only disparaging poor people, but also saying that their employees were acceptable only as long as they ""didn't cross the line"" into friendly relationships.

The preceding half of the film was mostly the Kims feeling that, just maybe this time, they were ascending the social ladder again.\*  Instead of folding pizza boxes, they got to dress a little nicer, spending time in a nice house and driving a nice car.  What they hadn't foreseen was how disposable they really were.  There's no such thing as career advancement for tutors, drivers, or housekeepers.  A clean suit worn by a private driver is simply a work uniform, just a different style than the polo shirt worn by the pizza shop manager.

\*Again -- the Kims had been better-off before, too.  Mrs. Kim has a silver medal from a national-level competition, so she knows how to work for success.  Mr. Kim tried his hand at running a business, and he probably would've done just fine if problems outside his control hadn't sunk the Taiwanese castella trend (indeed, he was better-off than Geun-se even though they both tried riding the same trend).  He also must've either owned his own car in the past, or at least worked as a driver, because he's smooth behind the wheel and doesn't even need GPS.  And I think he had even gotten into some level of lower-mid-management in the corporate world because of how comfortably he first spoke with Mr. Park.  One more thing: their apartment shows signs that they used to live in a bigger, nicer place -- they have a lot of stuff, and some of it looks like it hadn't been unpacked since they moved in.

**So the Kims have been trying to get back on the ladder for a long time.**  They've been taught, like you and I have been taught, that if they just keep grinding and working hard, they might be able to finally make it.  But that's not what happens at the end.  They get told, right to Mr. Kim's face, that they're not welcome, that they'll always be the underclass no matter how pleasantly they speak or dress, that -- **by Mr. Park saying ""Throw me the keys!"" instead of, ""Pick her up and let's get out of here!"", they're not worth any more than the dead homeless lunatic laying in the yard.**",dps3xy
fltdbef,"Logically, I agree. The fact that the smell issue got to Ki-Taek as his daughter was dying does seem pretty far-fetched, but also it was quite unlikely she was going to survive in the first place. According to the mother the paramedics were quite far away and Ki-Jung was stabbed in a pretty vital area.

But then again, it's not the smell thing that got to him, it's the idea that his family will never be considered anything more than workers or people from the lower class. (That motif of crossing the line, he will never and should never (in the eyes of Mr Park) encroach on their territory.) In addition to that, both their children are in need of help and still Mr Park insists that he drive them to the hospital (sure Mr Park doesn't know that those two are father-daughter, but he still doesn't care to bring the girl (who was supposedly helping his son recover from psychological issues) bleeding out on his lawn.",dps3xy

fghgs4s,"I agree that it's a natural reaction for both parents to want to tend to their child first, but what I don't understand is how it was a binary decision. If I was Mr Park, I'd say ""okay, I need to take my boy to the hospital, get the rest of the wounded in my car right now and let's go."" He has a limo, so it's not like there isn't space. Even though Mr Park doesn't know Jessica is Mr Kim's daughter, he looks right at him and asks her to abandon a dying woman so he can drive his son to the hospital, because even compared to the others who are literally bleeding out, his son's safety is the only thing that has value to him.

And you're right about the housekeeper - if they simply communicated with her on a human level they could have easily figured out the Kims were lying about TB and trying to scam them. But it's not that the Parks are purposefully bad people or even a unique case -- we see they're simply replaced by another family anyway -- it's that their coldness and self-segregation is a only symptom of the greater class divide that creates all of these problems in the first place.",dps3xy

That was the one detail that really bothered me. The parks are taking Da-song to the emergency room and they're just going to leave Jessica bleeding out on their lawn? Just throw her in the car too and drive them both to the ER. 

Everyone has been saying Mr Kim stabbed Mr Park because of how he reacted to the man's smell while getting his keys. But I think the biggest proponent for Mr Kim must've been the moment where Mr Park demanded he leave his dying daughter to drive his son to the hospital.

And having one's driver dress up in a demeaning costume to pretend-attack his son -- and dismiss it as ""just part of his job""...  seriously, would you turn the other cheek and just say, ""Yes sir,"" if that were you?

Having a personal driver is a more intimate, private relationship than, say, just being in charge of the kitchen staff at a restaurant.  The two of them have spent hours in the car alone together, and Mr. Park trusts him with his wife and kids, too.

fjdttat,That is an impulse reaction by Kim. He should have helped his daughter and Park's son by driving them to the hospital.  That way his daughter might be saved and they could still be living with rich family by concocting any story about madman and his old housekeeper wife since they both are now dead. And if he really wanted to take avenge from Mr.Park he would have multiple chances later . And if he really wanted to kill if could have done it later and not in open public and get labelled as murderer ending up his life in basement.  His emotions got the better of him maybe.

Back in uni I did an essay on Korean revenge movies and how often it's difficult to tell who is the bad guy as you are often lead to sympathise with the antagonist. I linked this to the relationship between North and South Korea - many SK families still have relatives living in North Korea, separated by the war and the aftermath, it's often hard for South Koreans to truly see North Koreans as the bad guys - they still share a history and culture and family. A movie I used in this was JSA where SK soldiers make friends with NK soldiers and a SK says the line ""what's so wrong with a group of guys who share the same blood getting together for a drink?""

But if they hadn't found themselves living on the edge, would they have ever stooped so low? We're shown that every member of the Kims was successful at something at one point or another. What happened? Did they think that they had a realistic chance of renewed success without taking it from someone else? After all, nothing is worse in this context than having happiness/success and subsequently losing it.

After Mr. Kim kills Mr. Park, he genuinely seems internally wrecked at the fact that he killed him (looking at Park's picture in the bunker). In the blazing heat of the moment at the garden party, with his daughter bleeding to death next to him and his son being carried out like a corpse, he accidentally (my thought, no true evidence for it in the movie) unleashed his rage not just from the Parks having all that he desired, but also the rage at himself (again, my takeaway) for even being in that position. Maybe even because he felt he caused it. And a person who he somewhat respects (Mr. Park) thumbs his nose at what Kim perceives to be the very essence of himself?

However, given the intense population increase in Seoul, coupled with corrupt government officials and greedy landlords, a lot of these buildings sought and received zoning permission to repurpose the semi basements to accommodations.

facg6if,"A few things I'd like to add to:

1) u/mitrafunfun97 has a great analysis of this already, but I think the ""no plan"" segment symbolizes more than just being broken by life. For one, the Kim family uses a series of brilliant but increasingly risky, complicated, and morally-dubious schemes to work their way into the Park household. They rely on careful planning throughout the first half of the movie - like when you see Ki-woo and Ki-jung rehearsing in front of the house that she's his cousin's friend from Illinois, etc. One of the first things one of the Kim family members (don't remember which) says after the old housekeeper shows up is ""this wasn't in the plan"", so then they don't know what to do. 
All of these plans break down, and Ki-taek ends up pretty jaded about it all, but Ki-woo doesn't really seem to learn his ""lesson"". He plans to go down to the basement, which obviously turns out badly; if he hadn't basically let Geun-se out of the basement, maybe he would have just died down there. And in the end, he plans to make a lot of money and buy the house, but for a poor guy like him, no college education and a criminal record, the chances of earning that much are near-nonexistent. The song that plays during credits was actually written by Bong and sung by the actor who plays Ki-woo... it's called ""564 years"" and refers to how long it would realistically take Ki-woo to save up for the Park house. So yeah, his planning is setting himself up for failure and disappointment. The idea of his father only needing to ""walk up the stairs"" is also a symbolic fantasy, I think it's about the myth of class mobility.

2) I thought he was going to kill them too, but that actually feels kind of out-of-character to me? Apparently Choi Woo-shik (who plays Ki-woo) thought so too. I'm not sure if what he and Bong say are super logical, but to be fair, I don't think Ki-woo was thinking rationally at that point. From [this interview](https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/parasite-movie-choi-woo-shik-bong-joon-ho-ending.html):

>I asked [Bong], “When Ki-woo brought that stone to the basement, did he try to really kill Moon-kwang or Geun-sae?” But he was like, “No, maybe it was a gift. Maybe he wanted to say sorry.” That made sense to me. Ki-woo isn’t a person who would kill someone. He would just go down there like, “This was a gift from my friend. I’m really sorry about what’s happened here. Here is my apology gift.” Maybe it was a gift! [The stone] means a lot. It has a lot of meanings, I think.

3) Yeah when they asked for house ownership info, IDs, etc I was expecting them to steal their identities and take the house lol. Even though it wasn't used in the end I thought it was a cool red herring.

6) I wouldn't consider the unsendable letter to be a plot hole, he was probably just writing to get his feelings out there. I don't think the father ever gets it, and I don't think the father is ever freed (or at least not by him buying the house).

7) I think the bruises etc implied that loan sharks went after her to try to collect their debts. Pretty sure I read somewhere that Korean loan sharks can be really brutal.

9) Don't think Ki-woo went insane, but not sure of the meaning behind the laughter either. Maybe the irony that his sister was the one to die, when she was the best faker and probably the least involved with the whole Geun-se situation? She was also the only one who carved a space in the Park household for herself on her own merits - even if she was bullshitting to the mom, unlike the others, she didn't steal someone else's job.

10) I kinda thought that had to do with the poor idolizing the rich/being grateful for scraps while fighting each other to try to climb the socioeconomic ladder. If I remember right, Ki-taek says something similar during the first confrontation with Geun-se in the basement, along the lines of ""how dare you disrespect this kind family"". Till the end, when the Kims start to see how sheltered the Parks are and how little they actually care, they seem to put the rich on a bit of a pedestal.",dps3xy

fhuvp4r,">In what world could that kick down the stairs be seen as accidental? You could see the anxiety in Mrs Kim's eyes, it was definitely intentional, a way for her to push Moon-Gweong back so she couldn't get to the Madame.

I meant accidental as in I don't think she intended to murder her by kicking her down some concrete stairs but rather get her out of the way. Yes agree it was a deliberate kick but the outcome (death) was in my mind accidental.

>Min gave Ki-Woo the job because he didn't see him as a serious contender or threat. This was stated in the film. Ki-Woo is flat-out willing to kill, and while the others may not be planning out murders, they carry out actions without regard to the safety of their victims.

So, rather than being oblivious to the underclass being willing to kill, it's that most of the underclass are actually good people and more than willing to be helpful to each other if it is of benefit to themselves (which is a bit drastically different I'm sure you'll agree).  The Kim's are continuously helped by others (Min, the girl with the Pizza company who offers the boy a job and only deducts 10% despite them not doing 25% of the job properly) but we see only themselves that are willing to kill. (except maybe crazy cellar dweller).

> These actions could very well lead to death, whether intentional or not. The Kims did not care about the cafe worker or Yoon because they too are underclass. 

It's shown time and again that it's the Kim's that are the problem, not because they're the underclass, it's because they're bad people. When they turn up at the pizza place, it's rudely dropped off as they had convinced the girl to fire the other worker and give an interview to Ki-Woo who never shows up screwing her over, then still have the nerve to turn up and eat (Hawaiian too!).

>Ki-Taek tries to establish a more personal relationship with Nathan, but is reprimanded by Nathan each time (at the party, Ki-Taek is coldly told to think of this party antic as part of his job when he speaks to Nathan about his personal life regarding the love he has for his wife. Nathan clearly values this distinct boundary between his employees acting as employees, not close members of the family or even friends).

As Nathan points out, Ki-Taek comes close to crossing a line of what is acceptable for an employee-employer relationships.  His comments about the Nathans wife are clearly inappropriate in a work place, I don't ask my boss if she loves her husband etc. And I don't recall reprimands?  

At the party Ki-Taek is also clearly irritated at being brought into work for the Birthday (some of that is justifiable - his house has flooded, he spent the night homeless at a gym and he's lost all his personal possessions.  But he also spent the night kidnapping and restraining people and going on a drunken bender).  When Nathan reminds him he is being paid extra to be there, my reading is as: 'I know you don't want to do this, but there's something in it for you as well', rather than 'do your job as I'm paying you'.

> Ki-Taek is shown to be an extremely skilled driver, 

We're going to have to disagree on this, he's shown as being a bad driver as he doesn't concentrate on the road and instead irritates his boss.  Taking a corner smoothly in a luxury car isn't a challenge. He's also continuously shown as being bad at things and trying to take shortcuts (the 25% pizza boxes is clearly because of his attempt to copy the pizza girl video). 

> Ki-Woo was recommended by Min for his skill,

I thought it was implied that Ki-Woo has taken the test multiple times and failed which is why he's not in any of the places he applied for.  (And his exam method whilst sounding good to the mum, is obviously terrible advice).  Min wasn't doing very well at tutoring either as it's said the daughters grades aren't getting better.  (It seems pretty clear that she just likes having an older boys attention so the same thing is that was going on with Min is now going on with Ki-Woo). Also, I think making out with your underage tutoring subject is pretty much the definition of being bad at your job.

>although Ki-Jung faked her skill in art therapy, it is clear she is helping Da-Song with his misbehavior issues and cares for him. Choong-Sook is a competent housekeeper and good cook.

I'll give a pass on Ki-Jung, she is an excellent fraud which might be exactly what they need.  But I'm not sure that isn't something that wouldn't cause issues later on. And again Choong-Sook does seem to do well, but this is only if you ignore the fact that as soon as the Parks go she behaves awfully.

> (for example, when Madame paid Ki-Woo less than Min but claimed she paid more).

I'm fairly sure she takes money out of the envelope as part of that would have covered what they were paying Min that month, but he announced he was leaving suddenly.  Afterall, the Park's do not seem like they need to nickle and dime people and it would be trivial for Ki-Woo to find out if he is being underpaid compared to Min. If she's willing to pay extra for an art tutor and a 'luxury home care service membership' it doesn't really make narrative sense that she's screwing over Ki-Woo.

> They are guilty of a lack of empathy towards the underclass.

To me, the only time this really shows up is the comment about the rain and the lack of potential empathy.  For them the flood is an inconvenience as they can't camp. But it's hard for me to see what they can do about this - or even if they'd had time to read the news.  We don't know if they're huge charity givers... they seem to pay well and treat the staff nicely.  Yes the existence of the rich might for some be a crime but that seems a little simplistic.

> They are not bad people, but they are ignorant. As Choong-Sook said, ""they are not nice and rich, they are nice because they are rich"". 

I think that scene is supposed to be seen ironically.  Having climbed out of their poverty and surrounded themselves with the trappings of luxury, she still manages to be mean to the dog.  The Park's are nice probably because they are nice.  The Kim's are mean because they are mean.

f6sy03n,"> i think showing ki-woo's superstitious nature undermining him serves to show the danger of idealism and mysticism, especially as it's embodied in commodity fetishism (with the rock), as opposed to a materialist understanding of reality.

that's a really good point i had not considered. I came out of this film regarding it as one **very** accomodating to Marxist interpretation, but not necessarily by intent. It's an examination of why the working class fails time and time again to rise up, but it's only done through a single case study of two families. And the film really offers no solutions to the problems that it exposes, which is why to me, it feels extremely nihilistic and hopeless (within its own universe).

I mean, take ki-taek, the most class conscious of the kims. He feels concern for the driver they got fired, he shares the heartbreaking experience with the Ghost of falling for the Taiwanese cake trend (that moment of weakness is what causes the Kims to fall down the stairs!) and he recognizes how the parks view the kims as lower beings. What does this all amount to? There is zero solidarity shown in any moment that counts. Even as Ki-taek attempts to get to know the Ghost better, he's doing it while tying him and his wife up in the basement. It doesn't matter that ki-taek is very much human and perhaps has the capacity for good, material reality and the overwhelming precariousness of the poor causes them to tear each other apart like animals, even while weeping for each other's shared struggles. And what of class antagonism? It's just individual resentment that in the end, boiling over into a hugely self-destructive act of violence that dooms Ki-taek to be a parasite forever. If anything dong-ik's murder can be seen as a metaphor for all the assasinations and other ""revolutionary"" acts done by socialists/sympathetic parties that end up doing little to nothing to change society (e.g. kaczynski).

I get the feeling we'd agree on most points about this movie, but ultimately I think the movie requires the viewer to ""fill in some blanks"" in order to start reading class struggle elements in it, even if it makes those blanks very obvious.

I suppose the movie could give an impression to non-Korean audiences that the significance of such collectible rocks were understood universally in Korea, thus making it a legitimate token of offering peace.

However, it isn't really the case, so I believe the idea of revisiting the other family to make peace with them by offering the rock would be as awkward as giving them a rare stamp from your collection.

He is free of the facade that Kim has to put up, but ironically the deception that Kim got himself into is the reason for that facade.

I think the movie does a good job of showing how the most effective way for someone to climb the social ladder is often through immoral means. The Kims living in a semi-basement is symbolic of their desire to ascend in society. They do not want to live fully in the basement, and developed a knack for deceit that allows them to take a risk, which almost pays off.

Your comment is totally fine, it's just your opinion. I'm just telling you why my opinion is different and trying to explain why.

While Park wouldn't have been slowed down a lot, that's not the point... he put his precious sensibilities over even his own son, imo making him look even more selfish. 

I don't think Kim cared where the smell came from, just that Park couldn't be bothered with the poor... that even when dead in front of him or dying he cared more about protecting his nose from a small inconvenience than showing an ounce of sympathy for the tragedy in front of him. You could say it all happened suddenly, but it's sometimes in those moments where someone only has time to react when you see who they really are...

Yeah, the housekeeper's husband smelled for good reasons, but Kim's smell was for a good reason, too. Neither could get away from smelling like poor people, and maybe that's where I totally relate to Kim. I know I started rising above my class when I got into a top ten university, and got my first job out of school, but there's something sometimes indescribable that keeps us poor people from ever truly fitting in with the wealthy. Some people get over this better than others, but I never did. Feeling like an imposter was too much for me.

Even if you get over feeling like a fraud, it's like this article I read once where this woman who grew up poor ended up with wealthy friends. She said when she paid attention that we even move different than they do. It's often small things that set us apart. 

I think it struck Kim that he would never matter to Park or anyone like him, and he broke. A lot of it was I'm sure being treated like nothing by wealthy people his whole life and brushing it aside like it was his imagination. That's how we move on sometimes just to get through life. I'm white, but my husband is Filipino and there are plenty of times where someone has been racist towards him that is more subtle than calling him a slur, etc and he asks me,""Was that my imagination?"" 

We want to believe that we aren't truly being treated as less than human and it dawned on Kim that he was never really human to these people.

Drugs aren’t a thing in Korea (you could be imprisoned for smoking a joint) and she sure as hell has never tried any type of drug(like 99.9% of the population).

Also, actual drug users would say ‘Buy me heroine/cocaine/ecstasy/weed/etc’ and not use the vague umbrella term ‘drugs’. She was clearly role playing. 

Also, added to that is the fact that even poor people don’t do drugs in Korea... it just shows what a distorted view the couple has of ‘poor people’, probably based on some American movies or something they watched because they clearly don’t ‘know’(or socialize with) any poor people in reality.",dps3xy

Basically any decent ordinary person would prioritize the person who will die with certainty if they aren't treated within ~15 minutes. The fact that anyone disagrees with this is a sign that values and morals are in decay - prioritizing your family is fine but if you would be more distressed by your son getting a paper cut or a superficial wound or fainting than by seeing a passing acquaintance being stabbed to death, you are ""lower than vermin"". 

Note that none of this relates to Mr. Park knowing anything about Mr. Kim's relationship with his daughter.

fdeckhw,"I'm not sure I understand the question.

What I liked about it was that it never collapsed into some unbelievable magic fantasy (like The Shape Of Water, or worst, the last Indiana Jones movie where they had aliens at the end).  Each decision that all the characters made was just believable enough that I could imagine myself, or someone I know, maybe doing the same thing -- so the deadly disaster at the party seems like it could happen for real.

It also shifted genres so quickly (which isn't unusual for Korean cinema, tbh), like when Mrs. Kim kicked the old housekeeper down the stairs -- I chuckled out loud at the moment she kicked because it was like slapstick comedy, but then I gasped in shock barely a second later when her skull smashed against the wall.  Bong Joon-ho was great at flinging us from one emotional extreme to another, so it was like a roller coaster ride.

Or the moment when we heard the story of Da-song catching a glimpse of Geun-se in the basement doorway.  By that point, we had just learned about Geun-se, we knew he wasn't actually dangerous or evil, we even knew that he meant to stay hidden -- but his appearance still creeped us out, and now we realized where Da-song's trauma came from... and maybe the boy might expose the secret basement himself, too.  So that revelation added to the tension of the story (like how Alfred Hitchcock described creating tension by showing the bomb under the table).

And you know how so many movies are boring since they're so predictable?  I didn't expect the hidden bunker, or that Ki-jeong would die, or even that Ki-woo would survive.  I thought that maybe the Parks would discover the Kims' deception, but it was Moon-gwang and Geun-se who found out first (which then makes it even more dangerous for the Kims, because now they have a rival who wants to destroy them).",dps3xy

When the father sent the message via morse code, he first wrote the letter in Korean, converted to morse code, then sent the codes looking at the paper. Geun-se's body was wrapped with tape at that time too.

So yeah, Geun-se needs to get out of the restraint, calm down and be sane while observing his wife dying, write a long letter explaining the existence of the basement of the basement, convert the letter to morse code, then send the long codes without errors to a boy who had seen a ghost coming out of the basement, and the boy decodes the long message without an error on his end... well, I cannot imagine this could happen.",dps3xy

Your insistence that the imagery and subtext is somehow *more important* that the plot is kind of silly. No, it's not.

The inclusion of subtext and social commentary doesn't overwhelm the plot and it certainly doesn't make the movie or its fans pretentious.

f6e2c4u,"To me, the ""lucky rock"" symbolized a vague desire to become rich. It's handed to Kevin from a friend that comes from a higher social class than himself. Kevin carries it throughout the movie, and only puts it back into the river when he actually starts having a reason to want to become rich (to rescue his father by buying out the house).

In addition, the ""weight"" of the rock also shows the shame carried by less affluent members of a capitalist society. Under capitalism, we are taught to be ashamed of being poor, of being less successful than others as the accumulation of wealth is often equated with personal value. This systematic assignment of guilt is handed off to the less affluent by the rich (which is exactly what happens in the movie).

fbd7lls,"I’m going to address your reply separately but feel free to read my previous reply from above. 

1) Maybe but to have the defense of a contrived plot point be ‘he did it because he has no plan’ kind of dings the movie in a really bad way. Having poorly written or poorly motivated characters is not a good reason to just kill off a character.

As a separate point. I really hated when Mr. Kim explained his personal philosophy, ‘best plan is no plan.’ It fit with his character but gave his character little to do or explore.

2) I agree and it made me feel really uncomfortable with how the director has worked on stories about poverty before yet this movie really attacks the poor to make them literal criminals for trying to escape their plight. I don’t recall Ki-woo ever mentioning a desire to go to university to make his parents proud. I recall a light mention of it during the conversation with Min, and when he announces his plan to marry the daughter but other than the end where his plan is to get rich, buy the house and free his dad. I don’t really recall making his parents happy as a motivation. I actually thought they all stuck together because housing is cheaper when you split the bill between 4 people. They literally are all performing the same job at the beginning of the movie just to scrape by. 

3) Just because a family member kills somebody does not make their relatives responsible. It is shown that the police are tailing the son after his conviction but nothing is ever found. And when you say ‘aren’t in on the murder.’ The rich dad was just stabbed infront of an entire party. There’s not much to be in on, since the poor family gained nothing from rich dad’s death.

4) I disagree. I think the Park family were main character, or perhaps secondary characters is a better title for them. I would definitely agree that the poor son is the protagonist of the film but I think since we spent so much time with the rich family, it is completely jarring to have their absence after the death of their primary breadwinner. 

Where you bring up rich & poor is where I use that as proof that this movie attacks the poor and portrays the rich as oblivious. Because we are only introduced to 1 poor family and 1 rich family then I feel this movie is a character study more so than it is an allegory for class contrast between rich and poor. But then there are scenes where it shows the poor family descending literally lower and lower to reach their home. This makes me feel that the movie is conflicted in what it’s trying to say. 

I do like your idea that the rich can move away while the poor are stuck. That’s a unique insight I would not have thought of. I don’t know if the rich daughter’s affairs were cries for attention however I am not a teenage girl so I do just write her off as exploring her own sexuality. And as I wrote to another response, I agree that she would probably be distraught, upset, angry and so on but the fact that we never get to see their reaction to the truth was what I found so jarring about their absence.",dps3xy
fbdd3wi,"1. If you go all the way back to Ki-taek rushing through folding pizza boxes (and messing them up), remember how quietly angry he was.  He tries to keep motivating his kids and put on a positive face, but you can tell how embarrassed and upset he is about the lack of success he’s given his family.  The entire movie has him being kept down (they’re even “below” bus drivers since they didn’t actually earn the right to eat at that buffet).  

Everything the Parks have, they make sure that people like the Kims will never get.  The night that they were stuck under the coffee table, he had to listen to the Parks talk about Ki-taek not “crossing the line” (staying lower class) while having sex on their couch (no privacy in the Kims’ cramped apartment) pretending to be low-class druggies (the Kims don’t do drugs) and their son sleeping safely on their lawn in an imported teepee (the Kims’ “lawn” is a sidewalk where drunk guys piss against the building).

2. Nobody said that you had to like the Kims; not every movie has to have a protagonist.  Bong’s point is that the rich are mostly above daily struggles while the poor are left to fight over the scraps.

3 and 4. We don’t need to see more details about the trial or the jilted high schooler.

The sets are beautiful. I watched that movie and left blown away. Someone else could watch it and not feel the same. 

It’s not because people don’t like being questioned, it because there’s no way to answer the question.

Maybe that's why Bong Joon-ho already signed to do a miniseries on HBO (six parts, or six hours, I forget which).  He's said that he has a lot of the story ready in his head, like what happened to Moon-gwang after she was fired, but couldn't fit it all into a two-hour movie.",dps3xy

I disagree. Our sympathies are drawn to them more due to their circumstances than their character.

>but the rich family were the real victims but the movie didn’t really treat them that way

Because the story is told from the perspective of the Kims. It never pretends to give equal weight to both families. The things that happen on screen are always symbolic of something larger, so the aftermath of the rich wife and kids would not fit tonally. It would be trees with no forest, and also a bit heavy handed for a movie with more on its mind than a simple morality play.",dps3xy
fftmxhc,">At that point, they just seemed scummy to me and they used their poorness to excuse any wrongs away.

True, and they said as much with, ""If we were rich, we'd be nice, too.""  They truly believed that money would let them relax and not be angry all the time.

But what the Kims didn't see -- not until they got close enough -- was how callous the rich were towards the lower class.  The extended scene when Mrs. Park chattered endlessly about how beautiful their garden party was going to be, how they didn't need any presents (code for ""we're SO rich already""), how much fun they'll have playing music (singing lessons are a luxury, and a cello is *expensive*), and how nice it was for the rain to wash the pollution away... and never once did she ask any of her servants how their night went or even if they're doing fine at home.

But (and I've said this elsewhere) it's the fact that all of this self-perpetuating stratification is so normal to us, that it becomes uncomfortable to see where it can lead.  Maintaining a professional employee-to-boss relationship -- totally normal in real life, yet it doesn't allow much room for advancement or caring for the employees' families (there's no way Mr. Park would've offered Mr. Kim college scholarships for his kids).  Paying for tutors for your kids -- normal if you have the money, but the families who can't afford it end up missing out on better opportunities.  Even after the end of the movie, the surviving Parks will still live comfortably, sheltered by their wealth and status, while Ki-woo and his mom will likely never make it out of their basement.

I suppose that the clearest ""message"" is that nobody truly wins in this kind of system.  Everyone looks out for themselves even as they rely on everyone else for their survival.  The basement couple probably would've been homeless, or worse, if they hadn't been serving the Parks; the Kims might not have earned a few bucks if they hadn't piggybacked onto their neighbor's wifi; the Parks wouldn't be able to make dinner without their housekeeper (and Mr. Park wouldn't have his company without all his employees doing the drone work).

**And just to be clear, I'm not excusing the Kims, either.**  I can more or less empathize with their view even if I doubt I'd take the same path.  And I felt that Ki-jeong's stance towards taking down the rich was that flavor of rebellious anti-establishment attitude that we like to admire (Robin Hood-esque, almost) even if we aren't comfortable with actually setting such a plan in motion.  But.... no, I didn't think they were being ethical about any of it.  Even if I argue that the Parks aren't totally ethical either, two wrongs still don't make it right.",dps3xy

There have been a few interviews with Bong and Ki-woo's actor where they talk about the stone, and while they never concretely answer what Ki-woo was planning to do, they emphasize that the stone is very important to Ki-woo.

If we look at Ki-woo's character, he doesn't come off as the type to outright kill people. You can see this when he enters the bunker after dropping the stone, asking if the incapacitated body (housekeeper) was okay. If he had gone down to kill them, that would be weird to ask.

There's also Ki-woo's arc in the movie, where he tries desperately to belong to the upper class, but in his talk with Da-hye, he comes to the conclusion that he doesn't fit in, no matter how hard he tries. Killing the two would feel contrary to this theme--in fact, giving the stone as a gift would make more sense.

Maybe you should tell us which movie you think is 10/10, then maybe I'll have a good gauge on your expectations. Do you like a movie that has more spectacle? More grand? A wide open world?
I would understand. I love grand looking, world building, and a big picture film.
But to me, it doesnt have to be. Look at some of the beat films of their year. Citizen Kane, Lady Bird, and Get out. These movies have just as limited world as Parasite. The story aren't much more complicated than Parasite either.
Parasite, although is simple, and the locations are very limited, I still thought it was almost a perfect movie. 
What I appreciated more in it was not the plot itself but the uniqueness of each character, how they see society, and their emotions.
To me, this movie's story us not visual alone but also in the subtext, the story of their emotions and how they interact with each other. how each character has reasons to why they are who they are, and act why they act. It's not unique, but in this film, the characters in this movie were almost as real as the ones in The Office, and the director made the audience feel that in just two hours while telling the story.
 The movie showed no character except for the children, we're good or bad. They're just in the middle. That concept in a movie is very rare. The protagonist lies on the eyes of those who see it. If a viewer relates more to the rich family, then they may see the rich family as the protagonist. If the viewer was also poor who's been stomped all their life by the rich, then they must have cheered for Kim Ki Taek stabbing Me Park in the end. 
Also, I love how the movie absolutely contained the world in the movie in just two small representations. Other movies requires to show a bigger picture to show the struggles and or conflict of the characters to really make the audience feel it, but this movie didn't have to. The limited space where the characters showed their struggles and conflict is even more impactful and tangible to me than the Hollywood portrayal of war. 
It is small, but a nice compressed version of the world
Two houses, but a universal situation nonetheless. 
And on top of that, the bonus of the movie very good at adjusting tone and genre. It perfectly represents that life, especially of people who do wrong, isn't monotonous that shifts only to the extent of how the tone it shifts to relates to the original tone of dull life. 
Other movies, no matter how good the story is, no matter how good the acting is, will not be a good movie if the director didn't do a good job in telling it. If the director controls the audience's attention through shots, tone, and music perfectly within his intent like how a conductor directs an orchestra within his intended rendition of a piece, then that is a good movie. 
Best example of good stories on paper but ruined by bad frames, bad shot, and shallow dialogue, and overall bad directing that treats it's audience like idiots is Less Miserables (Anne Hathaway one), interstellar, the King's speech. 
They're supposed to be grand, great stories on paper but ruined by shallow storytelling.

ff92ckm,"There was enough background jammed into the movie's runtime to explain their motivations, though, IMO.  Both Ki-taek and Geun-se tried to run their own businesses selling Taiwanese sponge cakes, but they both failed -- but somehow Geun-se failed worse (he, but not Ki-taek, is now indebted to loan sharks) and is immediately seen as ""lower"" by the Kims.

This matters at the birthday party because as much as the Kims struggle to stay ""above"" the basement couple, Mr. Park dismisses them all as being equally unworthy of trying to save.  Having been pushed down for years himself, this is what triggered Mr. Kim.

What you didn't like -- a farce/heist comedy about one family infiltrating another, then interrupted by a down-on-his-luck man driven to lunacy by four years of darkness -- is what I liked about the story.  It probably would've been fine if it ended with the Kims running the house (and after Ki-jeong stole everything thanks to the financial info she weaseled out of Mrs. Park), but it would've been too normal of a flick.

>Mr. Kim's reaction was very different from Mr. Park even if they were both fathers whose children were in danger. They both understandably lost their shit but Mr. Kim responded more to his anger towards Mr. Park rather than attending to his children - which isn't believable.

I mean...I think you can say that this makes Mr. Kim a bad parent. But that's distinct from whether the character behaves according to his arc. Characters don't always behave in the most ideal ways, so we have to separate whether they're behaving admirably versus whether they're behaving for the needs of the story. 

In previous scenes, he's been shown to be rather cowardly in certain situations. His wife even compares him to the cockroaches that flee when the lights turn on. Also impulsive, when he grabs his wife to threaten her. So when he took that impulse and killed Mr. Park, he must've realized that there was no going back to any normal life and abandons his family.

fddkv5w,"No, you don’t have to feel sympathy for anyone.

It’s “confusing” because it doesn’t follow the usual Hollywood template of morally pure poor people, obnoxiously asshole-ish rich people, or even the notion of “pick yourself up by your bootstraps and you can be rich, too.”

The Parks have a nice house and speak in nice tones, but they’re not as flawless as you believe.  The parents don’t love their kids equally (Da-hye is left to brood alone upstairs), and they don’t know how to take care of their own house.  They make a show of being rich at every step — Mrs. Park saying that she’s paying Ki-woo a higher rate is BS; asking party guests to not bring gifts is how she says “we’re so rich already, we don’t need anything”; they hire tutors to guarantee that their kids never have to associate with poor people by studying at school after hours; Mrs. Park is so eager to prove her wealth that she gives up all her bank info to the “agency” that “Jessica” created.  

Mr. Park says, in so many words, that Mr. Kim is good as long as he doesn’t “cross the line” and try to become his equal.  When they’re dressed as Indians (already tasteless enough), rather than saying how it’ll be fun, he tells him to do it just because he’s being paid.  He’ll never let the Kims become part of his circle of friends, no matter how hard they work; he’ll never ask about Mr. Kim’s family, he’ll never pay him enough to send his kids to college, he’ll never invite Mrs. Kim to visit for afternoon tea and keep his trophy wife company.

And as much as the Parks keep poor people down, they rely on poor people for everything they have.  Their children wouldn’t learn English or get over their trauma without hiring a tutor and therapist, the dinner wouldn’t get made, whatever company Mr. Park runs wouldn’t exist without low-level employees doing the drone work.  They’re a parasite on society, but they’re also in the position where they benefit at the expense of everyone else.  Their “host” are the collective lower classes that live beneath them, like how bacteria in the soil benefit the living things above.

Their use of the system requires them to exploit others, and they’re happy to keep it going for their own benefit.  We the audience don’t even notice how heartless the situation is, either, because it’s just so common.

If you should feel sympathy for anyone, I’ve opined that Geun-se’s plight is the most circumstantial of them all.  He hoped to become a lawyer or get involved in criminal justice (as shown by all the law books he kept in the bunker), but now he’s too old and can’t compete in Korea’s ruthless job market.  He tried to ride the trend of Taiwanese sponge cakes, but that got torpedoed by some bad press, and he was left with significant debt (this really happened — people bought into the bakery trend by signing franchise contracts, but when the trend went bust, they were left upside-down on these contracts without enough income to pay them off).  So now he’s been left to rot outside of normal society even though he tried to work hard and do well.

PS: Ki-woo took the college entrance exam four times, yes?  It’s been pointed out earlier in this discussion that he’s not in college today only because he can’t afford it, and that he likely was paid to take — *and pass* — the exam for rich people who hired him in their own fraudulent college admissions schemes.  Ki-woo’s friend tells him that he teaches English better than anyone he knows, so we learn that he’s already smart enough.  And it’s entirely probable that some rich parents got their dumb kids into Korea’s top universities by using Ki-woo’s test results and faking their admissions papers (remember the scandal here in the US just a few months ago).  So, again, rich society was maintaining its status by taking advantage of hard work from the poor.",dps3xy

I don't understand why people on reddit want to demonise Mr Park for this. I don't have a son but I bet if I did and he was dying I'd be pretty intently focused on getting him to a hospital.

fh2on5l,"The great thing I found about this movie is that it didn't have a strong message that it was trying to convey - or more so a politcal agenda. In other words it wasn't like ""rich people are evil"" or ""poor people are evil"" or anything like that. It's really rare these days esp. in mainstream Hollywood to do that - if you look at most movies like superhero movies which are so common you have the bad guy who is one color and the good guy who is another color and it's very clear. With this film everything is more subtle - that's why I'm so obsessed over this film. I keep thinking about it - it just lingers with me - there's something really unsettling about it and I can't quite put my finger on it. 

The biggest thing for me is that it's so hard to dismiss - if it was just the standard ""rich people are evil watch out"" I could dismiss it as typical propoganda against the rich a.k.a socialist type film. 

If it was ""look these people are evil"" or ""this person you thought was good, he's actually the evil one! What a twist"". The problem with Parasite is my mind can't easily wrap its head around 'well this guy is good, this is bad and this happened and eveyrone is happy'. 

I see the way I act and I relate to all these people. The way Mr. Park looks down in a very subtle way towards his driver is the same way I look down towards homeless people I speak to in my city - it's not an outright ""they are below me"" type of way - it's very subtle and I catch myself doing it - and it's disturbing.

finewf4,"Mrs. Park was subtly bossy from the beginning, and sneakily lied to ""Kevin"" that she was paying him more than she had paid Min (she removed some cash from the envelope before giving it to him).  But yeah, her cheerful snobbiness was amplified after the rainstorm to emphasize how far apart the Kims and the Parks were.

Ki-woo felt like maybe he could advance, but he certainly felt more and more out of his element as he got deeper into the household.  But early on, you could see how he automatically defers to authority when he's constantly bowed to the pizza shop manager -- so by his nature, he's not going to fit in with the upper class anyway.  (adding on: If you've seen an analysis of the visual lines in the movie separating characters from each other, you'll see that Ki-woo never fully ""crosses the line"" from lower class to upper class: when he's relaxing in the yard, reading a book, his ankle crosses the seam between the window panes; and when he's looking out the window from Da-hye's bedroom, his reflection -- who he wishes to be -- is also on the other side of the window seam https://youtu.be/ezwSfT7sXO0?t=377 )

Ki-taek simply snapped at the end when he killed Mr. Park.  His resentment about his situation had been building at least ever since the opening scene, when he angrily (and incorrectly) folded those pizza boxes.  He thought that maybe, because he'd been hired in a position that's so close to Mr. Park, he might be welcomed into his social circle (the conversation in the car about their wives was, to Mr. Kim, similar to the usual banter between coworkers, ""Yeah, our wives can't cook, but we still love 'em, right, bro?"").  But he gets closed off each time.  And, the night before, when he's stuck under the coffee table and has to listen to Mr. and Mrs. Park talk about how the Kims smell poor, and how the main reason he likes Mr. Kim is that he ""stays on the other side of the line"" between social classes, Mr. Kim realizes that even if he becomes financially successful, he'll never be able to shake off the stigma of being poor, and he'll never be welcomed into upper society.  Mr. Park crushes Mr. Kim's ambitions one last time when he tells him to just shut up, you're not my friend, you're just getting paid, and pretend to be a savage Indian.

So, when Mr. Park can't hide his disgust about Geun-se's smell, *and* he's going to abandon every other injured person in the yard, Mr. Kim can't stand it anymore.

(ps: everything in the film escalated as the story went along, which isn't uncommon anyway.  The Kims' scams started at borrowing a neighbor's wifi, and each scam got more and more unethical; the little boy's clues about the Kims and the basement guy; the Parks' bossiness and disdain for their house workers... every path got more aggravating and more intense over the course of the film.  I think the most interesting thing is looking back and figuring out at which point did I shift from being entertained to becoming uncomfortable)",dps3xy
fhk1clw,"There's a reason the movie is called Parasite, and I think you are also missing the point of the movie. The case of the grooming of the daughter is an excellent point to demonstrate this as well. I was super weirded out by it at first, and it is without a doubt a terrible thing to do, but fundamentally the only reason he was interested in being with her was because he would have access to their lifestyle and stability. Maybe parasites are gross and we have a lot of negative connotations with them, but fundamentally parasites do what they must because they have to survive. 

The movie is demonstrating how toxic stark inequality is to humanity by creating an entire class of people who are subservient to others in order to live an adequate life. That is why people view the Park family as the villains, not because they did anything wrong, but because they were the benefactors of a system that fundamentally puts their lives over other people. No amount of politeness or tact can change the fact that their existence as upper class people in a capitalistic society inherently marks them as people whose lives are valued more than others.",dps3xy

fhn50lz,"They clearly don’t see their family as equal status and categorize them as such. Like how mr park keeping on referring to whether Kim has “crossed a line.” Remember when he said “he gets close but never has.” That line is not acting like he’s worth to be seen as a peer or equal. Rather, he’s just a low level driver who is contractually under him. It’s literally the whole purpose of the movie to depict that. It shows how overtime, humans become a product of the class system and the nuance behind it all. Now I’m not saying you should hate the Park family or love the Kim family. But both are at fault in this movie and it toes that line perfectly in my opinion. The park family are so self indulged that they can’t see these people for what they are, people. Not low-life.

f6tmugi,"I don't really feel like that's totally true. The setting of this movie is in many ways almost hyper real and heightened. I wouldn't go so far as to call it surreal but I wouldn't really call it grounded either.

The movie is a parable in many ways and operates as one in the telling, it's less about the actual grounded plot mechanics and is more about the meaning of the story as it's presented and how that meaning applies to the actual world that we live in. 

It's not really the type of movie I think that was overly concerned with grounding the world as much as it was about exploring certain concepts and ideas through metaphor/allegory.",dps3xy

fhdmsxd,"

Mr. Kim wasnt justified in killing Mr. Park from your perspective, But from Mr. Kim's perspective, the entire system of classes was unjustified. His entire life as well as his children's life was unjustified. He just witnessed his sons head bashed in and his daughter stabbed in the heart. She was dead at that point. He was smart enough to know where that wound was. His daughter was dying and Mr. Park was screaming at him to drive his family to the hospital. 

This goes back to the scene where the family is getting drunk, and the dad starts to worry about if the other driver got a job, and the daughter tells him angrily and drunkenly, ""dont worry about them, worry about us!""  

Mr. Park did no action that justified Mr. Kim killing him but he was a part of the system that Mr kim felt had betrayed him his entire life and now that same system had betrayed his children as well. He had failed businesses just the same as the crazy man living beneath the house. They were one in the same. He felt empathy and understanding towards that man. He also felt in this moment that himself and people like him could not escape misfortune and he was destined to be a part of the people who suffer. 


All day he spent driving Mrs. Park around as she indulged on an extravagant party while his home was destroyed and 1000s of people like him all had their homes destroyed. Multiple times that family shamed him for his stench of poverty. They wouldnt say it to his face but he knew. He realized that this is how the world is. He felt defeated and shameful and hopeless. Some people have to work their entire lives for food. There are slaves and masters. Some people suffer while other people dont. There is a metaphorical line that separates two classes. 


Mr. Kim knows in this moment that he can never be equal to Mr. Park, he is on the other side of the line. He knows that he cant change this system that has been put in place since the dawn of society. Hell even if he took his dead daughter to the hospital that would probably just put his family in insurmountable debt. He realizes in shame what side of the line he is on.

So the only way he can feel equal is to cross that line and show Mr. Park and himself that they bleed the same. The line is not real but has been created systematically by a class hierarchy.
Justified or not, crossing that line and killing Mr. Park made them equal in that moment. They bleed the same.



The film obviously didnt resonate with you and that's fine. Not everyone finds beauty in the same things. I found it to be a masterpiece. One mans masterpiece is another mans trash, but don't tell me how to feel about art and dont say I'm desperately grasping for anything.",dps3xy
fhavpcm,"First off, buying or renting even an apartment in korea is harder than other places. You need a year’s worth of rent sometimes. Second, they only worked a couple of days. Do some research before letting your own misconception ruin an amazing movie for you",dps3xy
fharehv,"well if the movie showed that they’re still stuck in the basement, they’re basically telling you they can’t afford to move out, even with that money. Does it need to be more obvious?

And again, the theme of the movie is about the system and how humans, if they think they’re better than you, can easily not empathize with you.

Movies don’t necessarily have to bring something new. It’s valid as a commentary, reflection or metaphor of the current society. What’s interesting about movie is how they presented the themes in the movie using the plot as a reflection of class struggle. If you deconstruct every theme like what you did, everything would be meaningless. 

Kinda like watching a romance movie and say “Oh wow when two people can gel together, they fall in love. What’s new about this? I don’t have to see a two hour movie about it.” Yeah that’s kinda not the point of the movie, but you do you.",dps3xy
fhasj8i,"I think it's too easy and naive to say ""system forces them to act this way"". No. Not even close. People chose to act this way. Scam rich people, even get other poor people fired. They CHOSE to act this way. Their circumstances were bad. Truly. Poor family living in bad home but they chose to act this(not so good way) themselves. If their not happy with the system they should have been fighting it instead(that would be good message), not other poor/rich people. But their flawed characters I get that. What I don't get is the message of the movie. I don't get the ""critique on the system message"" at all from the movie. It never shown how disadvantaged by the system they are, how unfair the system as a whole is. We see the circumstances they living in that they can literally change themselves(especially when they got the jobs, rent a f-ing apartment ffs it's not that hard for 4 working people) Main characters still just trying to scam their way to good life without changing for the better themselves. This unfair system is nowhere near to be seen in this movie.",dps3xy

f60dizv,"Interesting perspective. I agree with you to an extent, the rich family is shown to be clueless and mostly harmless up until the very end of the film. They did not intend to exploit their workers, it’s more that they just live in an entirely different environment and cannot comprehend what it means to be poor. On the other hand, the poor family has lied and failed the trust of others to get to the top.


In one of the interviews Bong Joon Ho himself have said that he wanted people to figure out who really was the parasite by themselves, as the conlusion is entirely drawn by the viewers worldview. The film could also make a person wonder whether or not the failure of people to become successful is actually because of the injustice of the world or because of their own actions. Every member of the poor family was shown to be really talented, however, they chose to apply their skills to leech off the rich instead.",dps3xy

HOWEVER - I will say that while the Parks do not commit any crimes, the film shows the ignorance, obliviousness if you will, on part of the wealthy.

They aren’t free from criticism, but that’s literally the point. There’s a whole scene about how they, as a family, can’t afford to be “nice” and such things only come easy to people who don’t have other problems. They do bad things throughout the course of the film, obviously, but the idea that the flood is a metaphor for the consequence of their actions is ridiculous. The Kims can’t afford to “do their due diligence.”

(Let’s not forget that the entire “con” that the Kims pull is ultimately in pursuit of what would normally be honest work, jobs that they are qualified for but have not the opportunity.)

The flood is literally an unavoidable force that the Kims were never going to be prepared for in the same way the Parks are. To think otherwise would be to ignore the fact that *this literally happens all the time and even moderately successful people can be ruined by their neighborhoods flooding like this, and people in poverty suffer for no reason other than it rained a lot that day.* It’s not a metaphor for their wrong doing, it’s something that would’ve happened to them regardless of whether they had done anything wrong and that’s the whole point.

What’s more is that this isn’t just obvious in the text, the director has openly stated that this film is about wealth inequality.

As far as I understand, the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney both exist in Korea.

Until early 2019, there was no Korean law that stated the police had to say any of that, it was in on the citizens to know their rights. I think that is changing/has changed in some capacity due to pressure from the international human rights convention since 2019.

f8rrpgf,"I think this movie provides a pretty deep structural analysis for why the Kims act the way they do - yes, there's greed and perhaps pride, but coming from where they do it's almost impossible to avoid scamming to make money in order to live. Should Kevin have turned down the opportunity to make some money when his family was living in a literal toilet, when that opportunity involved lying? Bringing in his whole family and extending the sham was tenuous and feels wrong... but I can't say so that easily. 


And if there is pride motivating them, it comes from a system that values other people and shits on the Kims every day of their lives. You call it psychopathy but I believe the movie diagnoses it structurally - sure, it's not what we consider moral behavior, but it's also something we can sympathize with (and we have fun doing so in the first third, when the movie feels more like Ocean's Eleven).


So I don't agree that class inequality is secondary - I think it's indeed the entire point of the film, and that every action, interaction, metaphor, and scene is filtered through that project.

fhx11y0,"> They botched the pizza job

That one might be true. But it was only the father who botched because he wanted to do them like on the video.

No, it's implied that the father held many jobs and those all went out of business. There are hundreds of applicants for any given job. It is clear they have been unlucky and couldn't get into a stable situation like many people in Korea and in the rest of the world.

> the son fails every exam he applies for

Because you need money and connections to get into Korean universities. It is shown that both he and his sister are perfectly capable of doing not only their jobs but of conning the much wealthier Parks.

> the father has to be reminded to keep his eyes on the road (while working as chauffeur)

Have you ever driven a car? The father is very obviously a competent driver and this is an example of how Mr Park is overmanaging him all the while being helped out by Mr Kim. It's an example of their 'don't cross the line' and 'I know better' attitudes.

> the mother shows zero respect and responsibility as a housekeeper (and doesn't really know how to cook)

Respect? In some aspects, no. Competence? Yes. Doesn't know how to cook? She didn't know a recipe and still made a good dish in 10 minutes!

Was what they did to the Parks ethical? No. Did they have much choice to make a better life for themselves? Also no. They were driven to desperation by the hopelessness of their situation.  
This movie is about how poor people are trapped and how they are used and trodded upon by the rich who are in reality no better than them.

Look at the Kims’ apartment again.  They live next to a bar, so some drunk guy pisses near their window almost every night.  They can’t afford pesticides, so the dad says to leave the windows open when the regular neighborhood fumigator comes by.  There’s probably plenty of other weird smells that they’ve had embedded in all their clothes.  When you can’t afford to wash your clothes regularly but, instead, you have to wear them five or six times in a row, you’re gonna stink, too.

fjbi9ue,"I can see that, but I also feel like there is a bit of a less doom and gloom message for the lower class in there, maybe intended or maybe not.  I never took it as there being NO hope for the lower class, but instead a message that the trip up the societal ladder has rungs that can not be skipped and that nothing is free.  

While the main characters of the movie are representative of the upper and lower classes, we take for granted the representative members of the middle class, the Park's original employees.  I think its fair to say had the Kim's ploy not been turned on its head, if they continued to work for the Parks, they would have become middle class.  They wouldnt be on the Park's levels no, but there was a way out of the gutter. 

I dont think its coincidental that the exact moment the Kims dared to dream about being upper class, rather than being content with the advances they had already made, that was the exact moment the movie turned.  

In fact, as you point out the idea that Ki-jeong being singled out as the Kim with the most potential, you also realize she was the only Kim that the scrip specifically referred to her potential future when her brother mentions art school.   I take it as a nod to her her way out of the lower class and into the middle class. 

If you tie in what the Kims did to the previous Park employees, I take away a message that, while also outlining the bleakness of the prospects of the lower class, as cautionary tail that you can not advance yourself by stepping on the ambitions of others.

However, the irony is that Da-song uses the American Morse Code. That's why it makes it so heartbreaking as Geun-se frantically bashes his head to communicate with the people above as his wife dies. 

There are lots of hints that the Park family are elitists. Mrs. Park uses English words (ie. ""You know what I mean?"" ""Why not?"") to show off she has class and is cultured. She also mentions that the toys/archery set she bought for Da-song are from America. Additionally, when Mr. Park worries that Da-song will get drenched in the tent Mrs. Park reassures him that it's American made so it can withstand the torrential rain. We can juxtapose that to the Kim's half-basement that gets destroyed. 

Even during his death, Geun-se still respects the Park family because he feels indebted to them for housing and feeding him. Meanwhile, the Parks find his death insignificant and an inconvenience as he bleeds out on their lawn because he's on top of their car keys. 

The Parks cannot empathize let alone understand the issues the lower class face. Mrs. Park keeps praising Da-song as a genius child, yet Da-song cannot infer that ""HOLP ME"" is very close to ""HELP ME.""

The two of them have spent hours in the car alone together, and Mr. Park trusts him with his wife and kids, too.

Imagine, if they didn’t spend that night there when the Park’s went camping, the previous homemaker would be left standing in the cold and would have gone away and the husband would have died from starvation eventually. The house would reek. They’d eventually discover the dead body and tie up that loose end of the housekeeper and they would have been on their merry way to a prosperous future albeit ethically void.

But yet he's shown to have values and reasoning skills... to the max extent a serial murder might have. He *respect*s Mr Park for allowing his lifestyle. He only attacks the family for killing his wife. And he doesn't attack anyone except the family that took away all he had left.

fhsh14z,"> Mr Park didn't object to the way any of the other members of the family. He said it was specifically Mr Kim who smelled like a crowded subway. That means you need some deodorant

Mr. Park doesn't ride in a closed vehicle with any other members of the family, which is also when Mrs. Park reacts to it, though he was probably extra ripe from the flooding and sleeping in a gymnasium. There's also a couple scenes around them smelling alike and they assume the child smelled their detergent/soap but the daughter points out it is from the smell of their house.

Do you think professional drivers working for someone as wealthy as Mr. Park have the luxury of turning down coming in on their day off or becoming an impromptu children's performer and expect to keep their job? He hears these people talking shit about him, he probably just had the most stressful night of his life, remember he's the only one who realizes how badly hurt the old housekeeper was(I think he even realized she was already dead by that point and coming to terms with him having to likely kill the basement dwelling husband as well he tells his children he ""has a plan"" and for them to forget it). He's just been further put in his place and then sees his daughter mortally wounded and his son also gravely injured and he's expected to just keep doing his job(no one is blaming the Parks actions they don't realize he's seeing his children in this state) because apparently this guy can't even drive his own child to the hospital which he ends up attempting to do anyway. No one is saying this gives him the right to murder Mr. Park we're saying it is understandable that his mindset lead him to such a thing. 

He's also probably only gotten a few hours of sleep at most. They have to wait until the Parks are asleep then walk likely very far back home and when they get their deal with even more shit manage to get to this gymnasium set everything up and fall asleep only to wake up without a few hours to breathe and process everything.

It might've been originally intended manipulation but the irony was that the Kim daughter Googling something gave more info to the Park mother than all of the previously fired upper-scale art tutors.

“As a separate point. I really hated when Mr. Kim explained his personal philosophy, ‘best plan is no plan.’ It fit with his character but gave his character little to do or explore.”

That’s the point — he has nothing to do or explore.  He’s just stumbling through life now, and whatever dreams he had are long gone.  And by the end, after decades of hearing the idea of success coming from just working harder, and after seeing how much the upper classes have, he’s been explicitly told that he’ll never be *allowed* to have a seat at the table.

Just like Geun-se in the basement, who had stacks of law books from when he must’ve been trying to start a law career (or he used to have one but still failed, then got stuck trying to run a Taiwanese cake shop until the trend for cakes ran its course).  Neither family has a purpose anymore.

ffzqh0v,">	It’s explicitly stated that being a good person is easier when you’re rich.

So the movie is justifying the actions of the poor family (sorry, I’m bad with names in movies) because they’re poor? You would say yeah while watching the movie but then the movie gods *explicitly* punish the poor family by making their choices lead to their and the rich family’s downfalls. 

That’s an issue with framing that the movie has, well, issues with. It says one thing and does the opposite in a way that it wants its cake and wants to eat it too. “Yay poor people sticking it to the rich!” but at the same time it ends with the poor father feeling *extremely* bad for killing the rich father. 

>	Our sympathies are drawn to them more due to their circumstances than their character.

Which is what I said. The movie sets up you to root for the poor family by taking you in their world and fleshing them out. It’s a technique called framing. It focus on the pain of the poor family who are the instigators of everything that goes wrong and completely sweeps the rich wife and son and daughter under the rug by giving absolutely no resolution to them. They’re framed as completely inept (except for the son who after building him up with his smelling and Morse code decoding ends up being a complete red herring). So you can imagine a single mother with two kids (the daughter who was also preyed upon by an older teacher but why give any resolution to her even when she’s the one who carries the poor son to the hospital?) end up in an extremely tough spot financially when their sole breadwinner is suddenly murdered at their son’s birthday party. We’ll never know though because the movie (or at least the third act and resolution) have an issue with framing. 

>	It never pretends to give equal weight to both families.

Opinions are opinions and it’s 100% cool with me that you say that cuz it’s a movie so it’s open to interpretation but I disagree. Look at any reciew or conversation people have with this movie and you’ll find people debating if the poor father’s actions were justified and you’ll also find people who say loudly that the movies bucks tradition that most movies would make the rich people completely heartless (people were saying this movie was so bonkers I even thought we would find some kinda cult dungeon in the first downstairs sequence) by making them...just kinda regular. Uptight and naive and definitely not perfect but I think the movie bends over backwards to not vilify either side, which as I said before, is an issue with framing. 

I overall didn’t hate the movie (it’s impeccably directed to an insane degree) but I was really let down by the third act.

edit: I explain my opinion on the movie’s framing more thoroughly in my main comment here if it interests you:


https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/dps3xy/_/fftek61/?context=1",dps3xy
ffvd1ie,"I suppose they were callous but I saw their callousness leaning more towards aloofness than actual malice. Like the rich father (and mother) looked at the poor father with distain because of his smell but he very logically smelled like sewage. True if someone comes to work smelling like sewage, there’s probably a reason for it and you have empathy but even then, it’s not like they embarrassed him by yelling that he smells in front of everyone. There’s a lack of empathy but I don’t think it warranted anything near murder. 

And I don’t believe the movie exactly sides with the murder being justified either. But it also *kinda* empathizes with a poor person committing murder because he felt someone “better” than him thought he smelled. 

Like, I honestly think that was a really profoundly sad moment when he’s under the table and hearing that he thinks he smells like an old rag. It was a beautifully acted moment by the poor father cause you can *feel* so much in such a restrained situation. But then the movie cranks it up to 11 and the nuances kinda get lost.",dps3xy
ffydnbr,"I like this take. Ultimately, I think the film just wants to portray that nothing in life is ever just black and white. It’s all kinds of grey, similar to how all families in the film have varying degrees of goodness and bad. No family is purely good and no family is purely evil.",dps3xy

Park dad is getting paid at his job which allows him to pay someone else to do another kind of job. Without the work needed by the Parks, what will the Kims do?

To me, Mr. Park was just being a father and he didn't even know Jessica was the poor daughter of Mr. Kim. My only other explanation for Mr. Kim is also what you said - he was naturally a coward and the personal insult he felt from Mr. Park *at that moment* (the disgust with the smell, asking for the keys, looking down on him) was stronger than his ""love/care"" for his children, safety of their lives be damned.

Whats greedy is the upper class hoarding wealth. Its so funny to me that you literally missed the whole point of the movie and turned to blame the victims (the Kims) and called them greedy instead of the rich Parks... wtf.

Their crimes were bad, but they were doing it to survive. Us vs them mentality that happens all the time in real life. The working class backstabbs to get ahead in their position. They need to put food on the table.


I agree that the driver and the housekeeper did nothing wrong, however it's easy to root for the cons because they are the family we know most about and we see them as not all evil or all good. It's a very gray area. 


The killing was not random at all and the fact that you think that shows you lie on a specific side of the spectrum of ethics and right and wrong. A more systematic side of the spectrum rather than a primal side were it's me and mine and protect my family overall. Once mr. Kins family was killed all his ethics went out the window and he no longer cared about the system he was conditioned to follow. It then became the jungle were its beast vs beast in his eyes.

He was so frustrated while folding pizza boxes with his family in a cloud of pesticides that he fell silent and haphazardly folded them wrong.  On the surface, he jokes and tries to keep his kids motivated; but inside, he’s turning to dust.

From what I remember: Kim sees Mr. Park in the rear view mirror reacting to his smell; Da-song says “They all smell the same”; Mr. Park refuses to have a personal conversation about his wife (avoiding “crossing the line” from boss-and-employee to friendship); Geun-se reminds him that he’ll stay poor; the Parks make remarks about him, and fantasize about risky sex (back seat of a car, but the Kims don’t own a car anymore; and “feed me drugs”, as if pretending to be a poor junkie) all while he’s hiding like a cockroach; Mrs. Park virtually ignores him as she makes him carry her groceries, drive her around, and react to the smell of his clothes that he had to borrow after the flood; he’s forced to wear an Indian headdress for the party even though it’s not his job as a driver; and the kicker, when Mr. Park ignored the dying poor, pushing them aside to get his car keys and run away.

Everyone was in a panic to clean up and get out, so they didn't have time to go negotiate), but it was the day of the party that she wanted to go negotiate.

I understand what you're getting at. But the supposed ""sheer frustration & agony caused by the class difference in society"" to drive Ki-Taek insane & unleash it on Mr. Park wasn't established in the film.

More than ""his actions weren't justified"" it's 'the movie did a poor job at characterization & establishing the right cause which cultivated Ki-Taek's mindset'.

Disgust towards Body Odour & politely getting warned to not cross the line in employee-employer relationship is not some reason to kill a person by a sane & intelligent man who is smart enough to plan & motivate people.

Pour a can of gasoline on Moon-gwang's husband's body and burn him down because he killed his daughter.....OK. But stab an employer who pays him for a livelihood, did nothing except complain about body odour & is unbeknownst of the employee's relationship with the dead girl...Not Ok.

fhb783e,"Yes, they chose to act this way.

Now about why they chose to act this way, it's because they want shortcuts to the top (the stone is a metaphor for that, while it all began with Min's referral and how Kevin did some mental gymnastics to say how he doesn't think it's a ""crime"" to forge his credentials), as competing with other poor is hard, like how they mentioned even a job opening for security guards have 500 college students lining up for it and how Kevin took 4 entrance exams but still couldn't get into university. Not to mention about how the father tried many jobs and businesses in the past but it all failed. People are thrown into different circumstances and maybe a string of bad luck and circumstances led to them the semi-basement. But with the ways thing were at the beginning of the movie, the system was stacked against them, and because this way was an ""easier"" way out and an opportunity to break out of their current predicament, they took it.

Maybe ""force"" isn't the correct word for this. More like it's how the game is played and the rich had cheat codes at the beginning while the poor have to grind or abuse gameplay bugs.

Of course they could've took the moral or ethical route, but there wouldn't be a movie without the characters making flawed decisions.

f8mfafa,"I differ on the daughter. She was projecting onto Mrs. Park. Mrs. Park was quite simple and stupid, but the daughter herself didn't have any marketable skills either. Mr. Kim could drive well. Mrs. Kim could keep a house. The son could teach English. The daughter was a complete fraud. She is in fact a stupid bitch just like she accuses of Mrs. Park, but with a different personality.

Also, there are a number of people I've engaged with here that tend to excuse the Kim's of any responsibility for their actions, because they are poor. They believe the Kim's have no power and are too oppressed to make good decisions. Essentially, poverty makes the person, rather than the other way around. I think both cases can happen, but in this movie, the latter is the case being made. Thus the name of the movie.

I think the audience's dilemma is whether they should extend compassion towards people like the Kims. Bong is exposing the dark underbelly of poverty, which is unusual nowadays.",dps3xy

But the Parks have no idea so from their perspective, random dude sucker stabs random party visitor and is still going batshit crazy.

First impulse as a parent is to nope the fuck out of what they thought the safest place they knew (home) while everyone is in flee mode and their kids are still actively in danger. They did not have time to assess the situation so no, the first reaction is not fucking empathy for the bloody tutor you just met weeks ago, it's pretty realistic Mr. Park going for the car keys more than anything else.

fdgryhk,"I'm a month late but felt the need to chime in on two points.

1. The family stepped on the backs of other people living below the poverty line in order to succeed. Why should we have empathy for a family that considered itself better than other people who are in just as unfortunate of circumstances? It wasn't enough for the children to get jobs in slightly dishonest but ultimately morally acceptable ways; they had to screw over the driver and housekeeper (and their families subsequently) in order to make more money. *That* is a complete lack of empathy.

2. They were not living in ""extreme poverty."" They were below the South Korean poverty line, no doubt about that, but the definition of extreme poverty, according to the UN, is ""a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health, shelter, education and information."" Another definition is ""an income of less than $1.90 per day."" So, while we absolutely should empathize with people living like the Kim family, they are not living in extreme poverty. 

I think that second point is important when looking at the morality of their actions. If the Kims were literally starving to death then it would be understandable if they resorted to extreme measures, including violence, in order to not starve. But by no means did they have to screw over other working class people and even keep a family hostage in order to survive. Their actions against their fellow workers are morally reprehensible and show a complete lack of empathy on their part.",dps3xy
f7x5zxg,"It really follows the saying, ""everyone is the hero of their own story.""

Something I loved about this movie is how much grey there was in the morality. The main family was simply trying to survive and get out of the poverty they were in, but they were wrong in conning people and causing others to lose their jobs. The Park family just wanted to live the life they knew but they clearly thought poorly of people beneath them. Mr. Park seemed respectful but he couldn't even say whether or not he loved his wife. I loved the conflict of morality in this movie.",dps3xy

After the Park family comes back from camping and the Kim family escapes. They descend the stairs in a beautifully shot scene. This is them descending back to their reality. They had flown too close to the sun and now are falling back to earth.

That's fine that Bong made his claims about what he thinks he's created. But that does not mean his piece of fantastic art cannot take on a life of its own. My respect for Bong has grown immensely after this movie because his vision is so clear and his intuition unmuddled by any political biases he has. He has painted what he sees. He might think he knows what he sees, but that's the just the intellect chattering. He's shown something far more profound than some cliche sociological complaints about society's unfairness.

This relationship is similar to a dog greeting his master at the house. Look how he crawls up the stairs to attack the people, the savagery of attacking the son with a rock, the language he uses is very simple.

He's devolved to a place where it's EASIER to stay than to think of anything else. Why does a dog not run out an open door? Why does someone in an abusive relationship stay? Why does the grass LOOK greener but people sometimes find it hard to go find out? There's trauma, sure, and the unbearable suffering of being. 

But if you zoom out, his life was pretty cushy (or he ***convinced*** himself of it); no responsibilities, no one attacking you, no bills (!), time to read, no job, all the food and drinks you wanted, your wife coming by to take care of you, a reason to live / something you've convinced yourself to live for (your master's respect, your self-respect via his approval)... isn’t that like a pet’s life?

One interesting point is that at the end of the movie, Kevin decides to go legit anyway, when he could have earlier in his life. It could be argued that the family couldn't afford it. But after everything that's happened to his family in the movie, he's even worse off. But he resolves to anyway, and I believe him.

The irony is, him taking the job wouldn't have had to be a lie if he'd been properly aligned before. So the movie, as I see it, is about personal character and integrity. Everything lost in the movie could have been avoided (I think this is at least part of why he's laughing after waking up from his coma). But of course, it took losing the little he had to wake him up. 

Note: One point I love about him ""waking up"" is that he spent all movie pondering the scholar's rock, but it took someone smashing it over his head for him to get what the scholar's rock symbolizes (personal virtues which lead to wealth). He wakes up from his coma after being ""beaten over the head"" by the values of the rock, and then laughs mockingly at everything--even his sister's grave--that represents his former way of life. He then deposits the rock back in the river because he's taken what he needs from it.



On the second point, I wouldn't say pride is a marker of psychopathy. Clinically, part of the criteria for psychopathy is callousness towards others mixed with gloating over the exploitative act. For example, in the scene when they are drinking in the Park's house, they blame the Parks for their own actions--it's a ""look what you made me do"" rationalization. Often times psychopaths will blame the victims for being so easy to take advantage of, that they deserve to be exploited so they are taught a lesson. That's what I was basing my claim off of. The Kim's basically give this to us in spades. And yes, my sympathy for them does not waver even after this. In some sense, that's a dilemma for the audience. How much are we willing to excuse because they are poor? The answer to this question will vary depending on each viewer's personal temperament.

I still see the Kim's as central to the movie. People and individuals. Films with abstract topics tend to be documentaries which Parasite certainly isn't. It's a drama with strong themes about social inequality, but I think we are meant to scrutinize and understand the individuals and their shortcomings on a personal level, to learn how best to conduct ourselves.

Also, don't worry about your harshness. You were harsh, but I appreciate your honesty. It's helpful to hear and know. I know the topics discussed in this movie are sensitive for many. But nevertheless, the movie is rich with meaning for the individual's life. My hope is to explore them while also being gracious with others, because I really do believe some of the movie's takeaways are important, if unpopular.",dps3xy

In a way, yes. 

When you're left fighting for scraps at the table, it's a fight for survival. In a very extreme way, it reminded me of Maus, the comic by the son of an Auschwitz survivor, where the father tells him they ""had to be monsters"" to survive that place. When you don't know when your next paycheck is coming, many sadly can easily turn into scams and the like. I don't know why this concept is hard to grasp.

I never said *everyone* was like this. 

>What scenes are you seeing that implies that being rich affords you to be nice??



What do you mean, what scenes am I looking for? That's the entire premise of the movie! Hell, they *literally* say this through the Parks looking at the Kims. The fact that the Parks are fighting vs. the maid in itself is a commentary on how the majority of the people in a capitalist system are fighting for the scraps on the table amongst each other, to gain advantage over one another.


>I'm asking you how are you seeing that the rich family feel like they deserve more because of their morality. I'm not asking whether that is typically portrayed in media or not. I'm asking you: what scenes did you see that the rich felt they deserved more because of their morality.

I think you're misunderstanding me here. I'm commenting on the fact that if you follow the logic of a lot of the portrayals of the whole ""good, kindhearted poor family"" trope on TV/Movies rely on the whole ""perfect victim"" narrative. That in a way, it is showing that they don't deserve to be poor, and instead of showing that poverty in itself is something to be solved, it is tying in morality along with your status, that the ""good"" poor people don't deserve to be poor. And when a majority of the portrayals of class differences are shown with the ""good"" poor family vs. the douchebag rich guy, the audience can easily tie in the thought that *all* poor people have this heart of gold, and anybody who doesn't conform to that deserves their status in life. The movie is twisting this common portrayal by showing a more brutal reality.",dps3xy

fen1118,"I think there's a difference between simply being oblivious and making an effort to stay away.  Most kids in high school in Korea either stay after hours at school to study or go to a study center, but the Parks hire a private tutor -- which keeps their daughter at home, away from the poorer kids.  Most, or at least a pretty significant percentage, of Koreans travel by bus or subway, but the Parks hire their own driver so they don't have to mingle with anyone else (on top of being able to afford a car in the first place, unlike the Kims).

And I'm not absolving the Kims of their faults, either.  They think they have to be sneaky and conniving because they're poor, and that the upper class must be nicer because they don't have to work so hard (which is proven incorrect as they later learn what the Parks really think of the lower class).  They're also willing to push the basement couple down in order to preserve their own positions in the Park household... much like the Parks ensure that the Kims never ""cross the line"" into the upper class.

The tricky thing is, these actions are so common that we usually don't realize how they perpetuate class stratification.  It would've been nice to have a private tutor when I was a kid... but what about my friends who had even less money but were probably smarter than myself?  They'd miss out on extra education through no fault of their own -- but that's how it works when your social mobility is defined by how much money you have instead of how skilled you are.",dps3xy

They’ve had a better life in the past, as he knows his way around Seoul, at least (he’s driven before and didn’t need a GPS to get Mr. Park around), and he had enough gumption to run a cake shop for a while.  Some of their stuff in their apartment is still boxed and wrapped like they had moved from a larger, nicer place.  Ki-woo’s clothes are too small for him, as they’re just too short; but he’s skinny, too, so they haven’t had enough to eat.

So when we closely watch Ki-taek’s face as he’s folding boxes in a cloud of roach poison, he’s already disappointed in himself and what he can’t do for his family.

The scene under the coffee table — that’s where the myth of being able to become rich himself comes crashing down.  The Parks don’t want him, or his family, to join their ranks.",dps3xy

I'm sure some redditor will show up with a quote from the director or something, but the movie objectively is about the poor people (parasites) destroying the rich family (the hosts). Because that is what parasites do, that's what the term means.

Not only is the title of the movie literally Parasite, but the rich family is literally the host to all the other characters.


The movie does a great job of showing how incompetent the whole poor family is too, they couldn't even fold some pizza boxes right and got them covered in literal poison. Manipulative, sociopathic, and most of all incompetent. They had multiple failed businesses and couldn't do ANY of the jobs they managed to get correctly. The only arguable exception was Jessica, which is why she had to die.

There's been a few commenters here who've come from poor backgrounds and can attest to being infused with a smell that their middle-class friends never had.  They said it's from having to put off laundry, living in a moldy home, not being able to afford nice soap (never mind perfume), or just general things that a lot of people take for granted.  Not being able to stay clean is a sign that a lot of other factors aren't going well at home.

The Kims have been aspiring to be upper class for a *long* time.  They've tried running their own business, and they've had hints of moderate success in their past (Mrs. Kim is a national-level silver medalist, for one thing).

fh1loiv,"Excellent point, I agree that they lacked morals and foresight and were exceedingly reckless. But they were not lacking in ethics. In a society where, as pointed out in the movie, 50 college graduates all apply for one lowly security guard position, it becomes understandable to see why shortcuts to success and stepping on the guy below you to attain them become much more appealing to people who believe wholeheartedly that they should do so since they perceive the ones at the top as having done the same thing. They're playing King of the Hill because that's what they believe is the game being played. Is that how others play the game? Yes and no, some do and some don't. But if they believe everyone does it that way, well they're then locked in to that ruleset until their belief system is challenged and they decide to change it. Which is what every single human being does, in the movies or in life. They threw out their morals and foresight when they believed they needed to play King of the Hill, because that's what that specific game calls for. But it wasn't in a vacuum that they decided to do so.  They're surrounded by many people who would've done the same thing if they had the planning and cunning of the Kims. So ethically speaking, in their mini-society of their neighborhood and family, they were in the right. They DO have a sense of right and wrong, but it's heavily skewed because of the environment they find themselves in. And that's what they listen to, their environment. So, by their rules, they weren't just right, they were also winning ethically. Were their environment's ethics more in line with morality and foresight, none of the events of the movie would've happened, in my opinion. Could they have made their own rules at any point? Yes, but they were locked in to their belief in King of the Hill. The only game they thought could be played. As for the slip-up when the housekeeper came back, for all intents and purposes, they thought they had taken the hill.

They were who they were because they believed that they had to be that way to have a chance. Do I believe in that mindset?

Living in a basement bunker for years hiding out from gangsters makes no sense. Why wouldn't they save up money and move? The Parks' reportedly paid well. This should have been pretty easy to do.

""Kevin's"" tactics to engender himself to Mrs. Park were absolutely idiotic. 

The light flickering makes no sense. Anyone with the level of income the Parks have would have had an electrician over to fix those immediately.

The Parks' son having a seizure ONLY when seeing the man from the basement is profoundly unlikely in the real world. It's also not a real trigger. People don't have Seizures from seeing an object or person. Seizures are also very unlikely to kill someone. The info dump about seizures was specious at best. It wasn't so much actual info about seizures so much as it was just establishing what a seizure ""means"" within the context of the plot.

The Kims' having a smell makes no sense. They started making enough money to buy clothing. They could have easily masked the scent.

Why wouldn't mister Kim treat the basement more as a home base instead of a prison at the end? He could, quite easily given time, have figured out a way to come and go so he could see his family or at the very least get a cell phone (which was established to have worked in the bunker area).

fhaoe72,"Without having an intention to suppress different interpretations of the scene, I'd like to point out another aspect that might suggest a murderous intention of the son:

If he meant to make peace with the other family, there's no reason why he should have kept the plan to himself. The whole family was involved with the incident, and the supposed peace offering would have significant affect to every member of the family as well.

In such a matter, it's only natural for the son to consult other family members first, especially when considering the usual respect Koreans show for their parents.

As I see it, it's much more natural to assume he didn't tell his plan to anyone else, because he felt it as his own responsibility that his family was dragged into the whole situation.

After such a violent confrontation, he probably saw no other option than to finish them off.

But he couldn't suggest his parents or sister to commit murder because he felt it was his own fault to have them involved in such a situation, so he probably thought he must bear the burden of doing the unimaginable job himself for the family.

And both families are close enough to reality that it’s simultaneously benign and uncomfortable to watch them — the Kims use their family connection to gain employment, the Parks’ mother spends her day planning a party; the Kims get drunk off their hosts’ liquor, the Parks fire their staff because of false rumors.

And I think it’s those benign acts that say a lot about the societal structure that’s keeping the families separated.  Instead of only seeing what each family does, I think about what each family doesn’t do — or can’t do even if they tried.  There’s no way that the Kims could afford to spend a day shopping for a birthday party (never mind having a wife that doesn’t need to work; all four of the Kims need to participate in generating income somehow), and the Parks will never perceive a rainstorm as a civil disaster. 

Another recent post expressed some frustration with the Kims’ actions.  I agree, recognizing that Director Bong made their mistakes just plausible enough that we can imagine people we know doing the same things — or maybe we’d make the same mistakes ourselves if we’re desperate enough.

The housekeeper had simply been hired by the home’s designer years ago; and the husband, who aspired to make a career in law or criminal justice, got pushed out of the job market — ageism is still a thing in Korea — and put all his hopes into a trendy bakery franchise that drained all his money... and his plight is all the more relatable to me because my wife has suggested at times that we start a restaurant of our own)",dps3xy
fc0v77f,"First, he demanded that he drive him. Then, he compromised and asked for the keys. It was the former that clearly set Mr. Kim off and that was intended to serve as an insight of the director.

Look, if you disagree with the interpretation of the film that is obviously suggested by the director, that's fine, but it's pretty clear that the last 20 or 30 minutes of the film up to the stabbing are supposed to make us sympathize with the Kims and become skeptical of the Parks. The Kims' house is flooded and destroyed, meanwhile the Parks' son sleeps in a ""tee-pee"" outside and he's warm and dry. The Parks throw a party, oblivious to the destruction of an entire neighborhood that has to take shelter in a make-shift space. They casually spend lots of money on luxuries. 

This is all clearly supposed to be something that induces a change in perception in the audience - the Kims' have done many wrongs and the Parks' are nice but there is a fundamental injustice in their situation. The Kims' could have played by the rules, only having their son work as a tutor (which would be breaking the rules still but let's grant them this small benefit), and their house would still flood! They could be moral, as straight as an arrow, and their lives would still be dogshit. This is, in part, due to the system that allows the Parks' to have it all...

There are no ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"" in this film.

ffzuewt,">So the movie is justifying the actions of the poor family

I don't think it justifies them at all. I found it to be very condemning of their actions.

Showing why people behave badly =/= justifying their behavior.  I think you may be reading intent where there isn't any.

>Which is what I said. The movie sets up you to root for the poor family by taking you in their world and fleshing them out.

And then it prompts you to question your sympathies as the Kims commit more and more horrible acts.

>It focus on the pain of the poor family who are the instigators of everything that goes wrong

It focuses on them without ever definitively judging them as good or bad. 

>and completely sweeps the rich wife and son and daughter under the rug by giving absolutely no resolution to them.

Lack of resolution isn't necessarily a bad thing, it can often be more thought provoking to leave things up to the viewer. The movie plants seeds about the house being sold and the Kim father regretting what he did, and it trusts the audience to contemplate the details. If it showed scenes of the mother and children at a funeral or moving into a cheaper house that would have been very contrived and cheap, imo. The ambiguity is fitting.

>We’ll never know though because the movie (or at least the third act and resolution) have an issue with framing.

I just don't understand this view that if a movie gives the most screentime to someone, it must be rooting for them. There is value and purposefulness in what isn't shown. Look at The Wolf of Wall Street, it manages to both glorify and condemn its protagonists at the same time, often by hinting at things that *aren't* shown on screen but allow the viewer to speculate.

>I think the movie bends over backwards to not vilify either side, which as I said before, is an issue with framing.

Sorry, when I said the movie doesn't give them equal weight I meant in terms of screentime and narrative perspective. The Kims are very much the centerpiece of the movie.

What you see as a framing problem I see as a purposeful and effective way of playing with the viewer's allegiances. It makes you feel as though you're on reasonably solid ground rooting for the Kims then slowly and methodically pulls the rug out.",dps3xy

It's about the total disregard for anyone else's life or time because money is the only thing the Park family sees in in the Kim family. They aren't looking at human being, they are looking at dollar signs and as what price do they get to treat people a certain way, or without regard.

The horror of someone living in your house that you didnt know about, the horror of a family maneuvering their way into your life by being hired on, of suddenly out of nowhere a murderous attack during a celebration in your home. But I mean...we've seen that horror movie. The ghost, the killers ""haunting"" a mostly innocent family. 

But in this movie you see it from the other side. There was no malevolent plan. Callous, yes. Out for themselves? Yes. They probably would have gotten discovered eventually. But the first parasitic family (the housekeeper and her husband) intervened and, as the daughter and mother said...it got way way way out of hand. Definjtely should have formed some kind of pact to support each other. But just like all three families in this movie, they were all callously only thinking of themselves. 

The Parks, the rich family? They were too...self absorbed I suppose. It wasnt fair to them...but I can see how it all built up. The fathers spent the most time together, talking. And you could see the resentment building in him after that night. The smell he could do nothing about, the rain that took his home merely inconvenienced their trip, that they probably would have taken off with the car with their son and not spared his daughter a second glance, that no one was helping his wife fight off a crazy person or rescuing his daughter, his son bleeding and maybe dead. Maybe even the fact that he didnt love his wife. All compounding into one moment where the father had no gratitude for what he had or empathy for the people he hired and saw everyday, and the dad thought he had nothing left to lose. Its a horror story on their end too. 

Living in that basement was the jail time. He didnt even have what the previous man had, he didnt have the people he loved looking out for him, at least not to his knowledge.

Anyways its not so clear cut, I think. I didnt want them to screw over the people who already worked there, or take so much advantage of the people they served. If there was a little more empathy and kindness all around it could have been avoided. But they all made decisions along the way that led to this. The rich dad assumed the worst of the people he hired previously, the mother chose drugs over properly vetting the people she was bringing into her home, or caring enough about those people, like the housekeeper having TB and being tossed out without any excuse, her daughter having a relationship with her older tutor, getting proper therapy for her son.",dps3xy

Getting the 4th one was all about ill intent, malice, scamming the rich family, but at the same time taking away the only job the other family had (the maid). You can be greedy at any level, you don’t have to be rich to experience greed. Greed basically means that nothing is enough, you’d push other people similar to you off the stairs just to get more, even when you have enough. I’m not sure how problematic your judgement or understanding of subtitles (assuming you watched with subtitles) is, but the Kims were no victims in this film (maybe except for their kids at the end). But ofc a stranger online won’t change your mind, go back, watch the movie and mark down every time the kims do sth bad/evil and at the same time mark down the parks’ bad actions (but get over insignificant stuff such as discussing someone else’s bad smell with your wife, with no intention of harming them. I ride the subway each day and complain about the smell with my friends, if that’s why the parks ar evil we’re all guilty.)

With regards to the final act, I don’t believe you would stop and help a random stranger in a big crowd when you have someone crazy running around with knives.

I think that's what Mr. Kim was expecting with the conversation in the car.  Mr. Park started heading down that way to begin with, too.

(I also think this scene in the car suggests more about Mr. Kim's past -- he can handle a car smoothly, and he doesn't need a GPS to get around Seoul, so he hasn't always been stuck in that semibasement apartment; and he's kinda comfortable talking to Mr. Park, so he probably peaked in the corporate world  with a middle-management role before being discarded and forced to try running a cake shop)",dps3xy

That's the point, isn't it? The Parks are parasites as well, they aren't nice people, they just can afford to be. They don't have to lie and undercut other people to avoid starving, they don't have to pretend to not be what they are.

Yet Mrs. Park still considers paying Ki-Woo less than what she paid Min despite the fact Min didn't really improve her daughter's grades and no reason to suspect Ki-Woo wouldn't perform the job better (she even refuses to look at his credentials, because she cares for appearance over substance). She doesn't have any financial troubles, but she still lies and undercuts even without a real need. She even lies to herself about her son being a developing genius, while all he does is absolutely normal stuff for a child of that age. 

Mr. Park also lies: he makes it clear he doesn't really love his wife, and probably married her only as a trophy wife. There was no need for him to do that, to marry a woman he didn't love, yet he did it.

They are both also incredibly quick to terminate long-standing relationships with their previous employees. Yes, it's the results of the machinations of the Kims, but the Parks never ever thought about being honest and confronting the chaffeuer and the handmaid, despite both having performed their job excellently. They panic and decide to lie because it's easier. For them they were easily replaceable background figures in their perfect lives, and let go without a second thought.",dps3xy

Also, the wife physically plugging her nose while in the car with Mr. Kim. And all those terrible things said in privacy are still exactly what they are. They seem them as less than and subtle treat them as such. The park family was too self indulgent and as a result they couldn’t see what was right in front of them.

fnfkrq0,"The dude just saw his daughter get stabbed and his son's bloodied body get carried away, I think it's fair for him to not be acting fully rationally in this situation. I also think you're missing the subtext for why it bothered Mr. Kim so much. Earlier, he heard Mr. Park talk about how Mr. Kim's smell was crossing the line while at the same time disparaging the entire lower class. So while Mr. Kim's children are dying, and their murderer is bleeding out, all Mr. Park can think about is helping his own kid, all the while being oblivious and apathetic towards the poor people's problems. The way I interpreted this was Mr. Kim cracked because he's realizing that these lower class families are literally killing each other to be able live off of the rich family, but while they're dying all Mr. Park doesn't care about their well being, only their smell.

Your other points are kind of just nitpicky and can be explained by how normal people aren't perfect. Not stopping at three jobs is exactly greedy, I'm not sure why this is even an issue. The son messing up everything when trying to kill the people in the basement plays into his dad telling him plans always fail, but from a non-thematic viewpoint it makes sense for him to act in that way because he'd be shocked from seeing a corpse and he's thinking that the other guy is still tied up because that's what his dad told him.

He had been broken by a lifetime of disappointment and failure. All he had is his family and they finally crawled out of the slums for a while and then he lost everything. Once you taste that the world can be so much better for some people it's hard to go back, and appreciate the little things when you know how shitty your life is in comparison. 


You cant imagine how jealous and angry he is of Mr. Park?


You can't see that he sees himself in the man living under the house and he feels sorry for him and feels far more empathy towards him than a man like Mr. Park who has lived a completely different life and is nothing like him. He is angry and disgusted that Mr. Park is worshipped by this poor suffering man.

His whole family and 100s of other people like him had to sleep in a gym. The very next day the Parks threw an extravagant party and were completely oblivious to the fact that in their very city so many people were suffering. Many with out food. Their houses infested with bugs. People pissing in the streets. 

Mr. Kim is not a young man he knows that this happens again and again and he snapped. The body odor thing is something he cant even smell himself, hes been living that way his entire life and many around him as well. That is all symbolism of the longer you are in the a certain class the more it sticks to you and eventually you can never escape.

fhhvc0x,"Okay, so he's not despicable. That's all I had said. What exactly did I say that tells you that I can't see the ignorance of the Park's?

I also couldn't find an interview where Bong Joon Ho says he despises the 1% or anything close to it, though it is very easy to guess he does. But most rich people, i.e. the Parks, aren't the 1%. There's the rich, and then above them is the 1%. The Parks have money, but they don't run international businesses or have any kind of say in political affairs or anything of the like. They're not Jeff Bezos, Ortega, or Arnault. If anything, he sympathizes with both (rich, not 1%, and poor) to an extent. After all, we all live in this broken system that is the direct cause of the increasingly broken world we find ourselves in. I digress.

Since you're the only one to respond so far, I'll just go ahead and say that Morojnoye has gone horribly wrong somewhere. Saying that someone deserved to be killed? Even worse, someone who doesn't have blood on his hands? Clapping for it, even if it is a movie? Yeah, no. Never.

But let's talk about the exact same kind of ignorance being used in your argument that is used against the poor by the rich AND vice versa. Just because you're poor doesn't mean you can't be that way either. Like it or not, rich people are human beings as well. Do we ask the people we know to be rich how they're doing? What goes on in their lives? Poor tend to see the rich as nothing more than dollar signs, while rich tend to see nothing but the lack of them. It's human ignorance, not class ignorance. Ironically, Mr. Kim shows the most empathy out of any of the characters in the movie. I could wager that he did so for ulterior motives, or from a sense of desiring what he perceived to be the idyllic family. He is the lame duck of the movie after all. But from what we're shown, he genuinely seems to care for the Parks. But where was that empathy for the driver who's job he swept right out from under him? For the maid? It never even crossed his mind to think about them. How can we fault the Parks for being ignorant when Bong Joon Ho shows that the Kims are equally capable of an astonishing level of ignorance?

It IS a grey area, but not just for the rich. Both sides are wrong in some ways and right in others. The next level of subtext after the people, is the system that every person finds themselves in. Which is what is prevalent throughout the movie. The director's done a superbly elegant job of portraying that we all as human beings suffer in this system, not equally no. But that's not rich people's fault, OR poor people's. It's on the system/society that we all currently operate in.

Also earlier that day when the wife went shopping, and on their way to the house, she was talking on the phone and she notices his smell that the husband was talking about,  and raised down the car windows, also earlier that day Mr. Kim and his family lost their house, slept in the gym along with other refugees but they still have to work / pretend at the impromptu birthday party, when he was shopping with Mr. Park’s wife you could tell he’s not doing ok, so in that scene he notices that Mr. Park, while his son needed immediate medical assistance, reaching for the car keys still had to cover his nose bec he was so uncomfortable about the other guy’s smell, I think what really broke him is noticing that, as the whole “he smell different/awful” seem to affect him a lot, also it kinda look like he blacked out when he was stabbing him, bec after stabbing Mr. Park it looked like he just woke up to his senses and realized the terrible thing he had done.",dps3xy

He was pushed over the edge by the fact that his daughter was just stabbed, his son was presumably dead, and Mr. Park lifted that dead guy to get the keys and the only thing that bothered him was the smell. 


> After all the drama, why did the son and mother end up getting found out? I feel like they had done such a good job up until then that they couldn't continue the facade?

Their preoccupation with their own family could be a symptom of their wealth and subsequent selfishness that comes along with it, or that tunnel vision could just be them being parents.

At the end of the day who are you going to focus on, your employee or your only son? 

But I get it. These people are, at best, oblivious to the struggles of others. I believe their crimes were that they were just rich, gullible and self absorbed. In that sense their role wasn’t that of the villain but of the good mark for the con family . A good comparison would be Andy Garcia in Oceans 11 VS Al Pacino in Oceans 13. Garcia was not the villain. He was just a hardened hotel owner and ultimately the victim. Al Pacino was 100% the villain, which is why it made sense that they teamed up with Garcia in the later movies, but they would never have teamed up with Pacino. He’s a terrible person. Never were the rich family malicious or even overly selfish. They were kind, gracious, and professional to their employees. They invited them to the party, they paid them well, they were always polite. You said they were always looked at as the help, which is true and not really a problem. That’s what they were. It was our protagonist family that were ethically out of whack. If you want to say the movie vilifies the rich for being nearsighted, then it DEFINITELY vilifies the main family. They’re a group of conmen willing to commit manslaughter if not outright murder to keep the con going. But that’s what’s good about the movie. We don’t really see anyone in black and white because we’re dealing with people, and everyone has motivations for their actions. Some are questionable, and they aren’t always legitimate, but they’re always relatable in the context which makes them sympathetic.",dps3xy

That said it’s still an asinine take and the movie is literally receiving praise based on its critique of society/capital. It’s not even subtle and there’s no way in hell this film was made “unmuddled by political biases.” It’s a blatantly, openly political critique and even if it weren’t there is no such thing as a film without “political bias.”

>But I feel mine leaves more hope and inspiration for those who are underprivileged. One of them puts the power in society. The other puts power in the hands of the individual characters.

You’re entitled to your interpretation but that doesn’t mean that that interpretation has any merit, certainly not when the film is literally, textually and subtextually, about the imbalance of power. Without that imbalance this story probably wouldn’t exist. The film wouldn’t even have been made the way it was without the obvious societal ills that the story is predicated upon.

And trying to extort more money out of the ex-housemaid is also a pretty evil things to do, which, one thing leads to the other resulting in the ultimate downfall of the Kim's family.

fb3iyu7,"Assuming you're in the US (the incentives/value of them work differently in other countries), you want to look for cards that fit into the things you spend money on.  It's extremely important to understand the credit card is just a short term loan, and you will be in deep shit if you spend more than you can afford. 

But if you can control your spending and find cards with perks to match, you can get a lot out of it. 

For instance, I pay a lot of bills using the US Bank Cash+ card. It's a card with no fees that gives you 5% back on categories you get to choose, like phone and internet bills. Since I'm going to be paying for phone and internet anyways, it makes sense to always pay using that card and get 5% back.

Every month, you'll get a bill with a minimum payment due, statement balance due and current balance due. You only want to pay statement balance. If you pay beneath that, you'll have to pay interest. If you pay the current balance, you're paying the credit card company before you really need to. Always pay the statement balance.

Also once you get multiple cards, set them up so they all have similar due dates. Make an activity of going through all your bills at once, checking them and paying them. Really make sure you check them. Sometimes companies will try to charge you unfairly - usually it's restaurants fudging tips but I even had Best Buy try to do it once (they claimed it was a widespread system error but I wonder how many customers didn't catch it).

If you spend more than $500/month on credit cards, start looking for special deals like cards that offer you $150 back if you spend 1,500 in the first 3 months. I had to get a flight for a wedding so I signed up for an American Airlines card that gave me $200 off my ticket immediately, and then like 50k miles if I spent 3k in 4 months.",dps3xy

Keep a low limit and over time, as you consistently pay the bill, you'll build up credit.

Ki-Woo is the one most enthralled by it, probably because it's a gift from his friend, and it represents his aspirations in his eyes, but at the same time it is at the forefront when things go completely wrong for him and his family: the flood and then getting almost killed by it, which segues into his sister dying, his father killing Park in a fit of rage, and their lies crumbling. 

Then he gets rid of the rock and things get better: at the trial him and his mother manage to not end up in jail, he finds out his father is alive and decides to prioritise making things better for his family, this time without lies and deceit. He may not succeed, which I feel the ending heavily implies, but he gets a second chance.

Ironically, if Ki-Woo hadn't decided to kill the old caretaker and her husband, he wouldn't have opened the basement, the husband wouldn't have fled and the party would have gone as planned with no horrific bloodshed. With the extra money from the party, the Kims could have tried to fix their home or rent a new place, and the facade could continue.

It’s fair to assume Min and boy Kim were high school mates and also Min didn’t feel unfamiliar or uncomfortable in the area so I would assume they grew up together in that nwghiborhood. Also he expressed great disdain for the preppie boys in college who I would assume came from the higher class. 

As for the reverence, I think that has more to do with how much Min has accomplished and his fighting spirit rather than him being from a higher class. His ability to travel abroad could be from a scholarship or the money he saved from working for the parks.

It was based on this experience that she thought there was a fifteen minute window.

They were not overreacting to him scraping his knee or something. Obviously they should have driven the stabbing victims to the hospital as well.

I just don't think it makes sense when people interpret this film to mean Mr park is a greedy Fk and that the conclusion is rich bastards only care about themselves. That is not really it so it's why if you recognise that you would know he did what he could understandably given his social class and in the face of a murderous madman with a son who could become brain-dead or damaged if he doesn't get to the hospital quick. Mr park didn't have a clue about the flood or that they were relatives of each other. Some people dumbed the movie down too much imo. Overall though the parasitic poor family are the ones at fault since they are the ones who conned them. Mr park didn't force anyone to do anything, which is also why he compromised by asking him to throw the keys if he won't drive. He's not meant to come across as an evil prick but a product too of his social class and conditioning

I am one of the people who also think him killing Mr park was a bad move on the plot script and done as a haphazardous way to find an excuse to make him become a basement dweller himself to become the ultimate parasite. It doesn't make any sense to go from having no job, then getting a job while being treated like second class citizens he wasn't being treated like vermin by any means by mr. park either , to just kill Mr park regardless of that built up.

No matter how big or small the difficulties were in the life of the poor one in this example, each instance chips away at their patience, jades their view, etc. 

That being said, a poor person can still be nice and a rich one can still be mean.

feergbb,"omf- lets break this down: You're treating the Kim's and Parks like they're people who actually exist.... u see the problem?

Parasite is a social commentary on the rich and how even tho both families are just people, society treats both so different, and how unfairly privileged one is over the other. Like i said: Greed doesnt apply to the Kims cuz unlike the Parks, they arent hoarding.

I find it very ironic that you bring up looking out for your family... Cuz thats exactly what the Kims where doing by trying to get themselves to all work @ the Park's,to essentially live there: The kims were living in extremely tough and unfair conditions, while the parks got a whole mansion. Scamming them was totally fine and fair so idk why you're crying about that of all things lol. Its redistribution of wealth. 

As for getting the other workers fired, that sucks, and they felt bad but told themselves they have it worse/need it more, which is most probably true.

The whole point of the movie is to show how unfair our capitalist based society is and to draw parallels between the rich and the 'lower' class i.e Rain is potentially life threatening for the Kims and leaves them homeless while it simply cost the Parks a camping trip (hell they're privileged enough to see it as a good thing, commenting on how sunny it is right after) And while Ki-Woo was on the phone with the rich mom, she was going through aid relief charity clothes, while the mom was in her huge closet)

Also...i cant believe how oblivious you were to the smell scene (and apparently the whole movie)... big yikes. There's a HUGE difference between complaining about your smelly friends and park calling people who ride the subway ""smelly"" cuz he sees himself above that (he has a personal driver). Its classicism. That's what the whole movies about. Like why else do you think Bong Joon-ho added that scene, among many other parallels between the two families?

I’m sure he is away a lot but Uncomfortable sounding answers to a chauffeur asking too much are not evidence when all the actions show otherwise. 

With the firings, the house keeper is the result of extreme gaslighting by the family and Mrs Park is said to be simple and seems easily led. Being trusting and naive/gullible are not evil or bad traits.  Nor is wanting to see the best in your child. I also (as explained) don’t see her short changing the son (even if it was he agrees to the contract anyways.... it’s hardly the crime of the century to pay a new starter a different rate of pay).  Mrs Park being a Parasite and bad person because she’s a savvy business women when it comes to english tutors but completely naive in all other financial dealings is just such an odd conclusion. 

For the chauffeur the explanation given seems completely sound (and I don’t think it’s a long time employee - they do mention his hiring as though it was recent) he’s worried about a guy who would bring strange women to his bosses car.  Remember, the sequence of events is the daughter is driven home, and then the panties are found the next day? Or soon after. When questioned the daughter highly implies the chauffeur was after her and then they find evidence that the guy had to fulfil his urge that night as well so their worry seems fairly justified (albeit with very circumstantial evidence).

This shows how desperate you are. 

I said in the post above that it was Moon-gwang's husband who killed his daughter and bashed the son's head. 

I added, Park had nothing to do with it. 

I added, Ki-Taek was shown intelligent in the film and he was smart enough to understand the fact that Park didn't kill his kids. 

Forced to sleep in a gym doesn't add up to the supposed 'build-up' which drove Ki-Taek insane. 
'He had to sleep in the gym'.....Seriously? 
During floods even Villas of rich people get affected and they have to move out, sleep in cars and stuffs like that. 

My whole point is that the movie did a poor thing by showing Ki-Taek as an intelligent person right from the beginning. He should have shown Naïve, Timid & downright Emotional. Things would have then made a little more sense because you can't expect sane smart opportunist con-man guy to snap just by having body odour & sleeping at the gym !

fhkhcow,"I do agree with you. However I did view the movie knowing the directors perspective & that he was using the families to represent two very different sides of the socio economic coin. 

I don’t think the Parks were bad people but they were ignorant due to privilege, as you said & as many people in society are. Their characters didn’t deserve the birthday party fiasco but I don’t think that’s the point of the film at all so it’s irrelevant. 

It’s a story, about class divide, & the desperation & struggle of the poor. the characters are both pretty normal families used to illustrate that. It isn’t a battle of good and evil so I don’t know why people care so much that the Parks didn’t deserve what happened to them. It’s just not the point being made at all. They serve the metaphor & they are likeable enough but that doesn’t make them good people nor does it make them bad but they do represent the rich. My takeaway was that Bong Joon Ho isn’t the biggest fan but he made complicated characters.",dps3xy

f60jv6l,">  So, one of the questions raised by the movie is whether the world would really become a better place if you allow the poor to get access to someone else’s money, or the poor would clash with themselves until there is nothing left to redistribute.  
  
See i personally think this is more of the following: Under a capitalist system the poor fight for the scraps of the rich. There was no redistribution, there simply was capitalism, rich hiring poor, poor trying to get the most out of it which ultimately clashes them against other poor people. This leads to tragedy and disaster.   
And the ending itself shows how ingrained this capitalistic system is in everyone, the son wants to get rich to free his father, which is the most absurd way quite frankly and bound to fail.

Whereas, in OATIHollywood, the ending was not expected by anyone. Even though we all knew the actual story. It was clever, fresh, brilliant. Which is what a best picture winner should be AT LEAST.  1917 was just another war movie with a clever camera trick. Ford vs Ferrari had great action work but Damon's acting killed it's chances.

They had no qualms about inappropriately indulging in luxury while the rich family was away. Also, why is nobody talking about how the rich daughter is probably underaged and the poor son not having any hesitation with that relationship?? I was already like 'wtf' that early in the movie.

The father also tied up the original basement dwellers and left them to die without any real plan to 'rescue' them the next day.

Class mobility doesn’t exist in the way that the Kim’s might imagine so, it’s not a staircase that you can just go up and down on — this is a delusion, and that’s the point. The Kim’s can’t just walk up those steps or pull themselves up.

It’s been a while since this thread went up but I’ve seen the discourse around this film follow a similar trend of a small minority of people interpreting it as some condemnation or perhaps a criticism of the Kims’ actions and honestly I don’t know how much clearer the film could be in that it is no such thing.",dps3xy

So if he could have taken the exam during military service, that's six years older than Da-hye, who's a sophomore; and it'd be eight years' difference if he took the exam after his military time.

(we don't think that he failed four times -- but instead, he surely passed four times, because Min says he's so much smarter than his own college friends; and a sub-theory is that Ki-woo was paid by rich families to take it to get good scores for their kids as part of fraudulent college admissions schemes)",dps3xy

Whether a movie sucks or not has little to do with how realistic it is (the entire MCU is fantasy, of course, and it's still fun), but I think Bong made a successful effort to stick within a plausible framework of real life events while still taking us places that we didn't expect.

(adding on) Every feature of the story has a normally innocuous explanation, I'd say.

* Secret bunker: Hide from creditors, take shelter during nuclear conflict;
* Taking the college exam multiple times: This happens ALL the time;
* Hiring tutors: If you have money, you hire a tutor;
* Failed restaurants: Google for ""Taiwanese sponge cakes in Korea"";
* Hired help like drivers and housekeepers: Again, if you have the money...;
* Basement apartments: I lived in one myself.  And you'll be amazed that there are sometimes apartments in sub-basements *below* the Kims';
* The rumor about the driver meeting prostitutes: Duh, of course this can happen;
* Someone hiding inside a house: Rare, but there are stories out there;
* Inappropriate relationship between student and teacher: Probably in today's news;

He's happy Mr. Kim doesn't ""cross the line"" and get too comfortable and think they are in anyway equals or friends. He doesn't want his workers ""crossing the line"". 

I also don't really see how ""the boss is in the bushes too!"" in anyway makes it ok to say Mr. Kim should do whatever he has to. Why is everyone ignoring the context? Mr. Kim's shitty life just got exponentially shittier within the last 24 hours and a man he knows thinks he is gutter trash see's he isn't 100% happy to play Indian and tells him ""you're being paid what is the big deal why are you unhappy?""

I doubt it's acceptable in Korea to vent at your boss about your personal life specially in a scenario/job like that, and that would again be ""crossing the line"".

Had Mr. Kim not known about the smell thing, not just spent the entire night hiding under a table, walking however many miles home in the rain to get home to a flooded house and all his meager possessions ruined, not know his wife just killed a woman and that he has to kill that womans husband he probably would've been more than ecstatic to get overtime and play pretend but again... context.

But it's your day off so you have time to figure stuff out and maybe work on salvaging what you can from your flooded home. Nope, you're called in because they want an impromptu birthday party and for hours you hear your bosses wife tell people ""don't bring presents, lol!!!"" ""what a beautiful day after the rain"" etc etc... 

I'll repeat this. On a normal day I don't think the Kim's would've been adverse to coming in on their day off and doing anything the Park's asked(they probably would've been thrilled at the prospect of overtime pay and to get to enjoy fancy foods, the Kims are never shown as lazy but simply victims of circumstance) but we as the audience know the last thing they needed was to have to go back to that house with no time to regroup themselves. 

Why are you ignoring everything else and focusing on ""workers should do whatever is asked of them in any scenario and be perfectly happy and ignore their life falling to shambles around them!"" Why are you ignoring everything Mr. Kim went through on likely little to no sleep in an extremely stressful situation, we don't know how many hours they had to lay perfectly still under a table with the possibility at any second they would be found. No ones saying a ""househould servant"" shouldn't be able to play along with some birthday festivities but Mr. Kim was not in the best condition to put on a happy face. How much will power do you think it took to not explode with ""My house was flooded last night and I lost everything!"" when he's being told to basically smile, you're being paid.

To recap: Highly stressful night, physical toll walking home and being tensed up under a table for hours, discovering your entire house and belongings are gone, knowing your wife has likely killed someone and the basement husband needs to be dealt with, finding out your boss thinks you smell like ""poor"" , being given no downtime, forced to listen to how wonderful life is all day, being told ""be happy, we're paying you"" and then seeing your two children severely wounded and feeling totally helpless.

Am I the only one who didn't see Mr. Kim stabbing Mr. park as a willfully malicious act he was glad he did? He immediately snaps out of it and realizes what he did, he was a man pushed to the brink and snapped in a moment of extreme stress and shock.

In other words the vast majority of billionaires did not inherit their billions. A billionaire is extreme though - Mr. Park likely has a net worth of $5mill - $20mill (he could also have mortgaged that house).

This conversation could go on for a long time but the idea that someone couldn't make something of themselves because they're stuck in a class is a feudal concept - the reality is that poor guy's daughter actually has really good abilities to make fraudelent documents - they're all very crafty - if they had put that into a legitimate business they could actually have gotten somewhere.

fhvt870,">I don’t see the evidence that Mr Park doesn’t love his wife.

Both times Kim says that Mr. Park must love his wife, Park's reactions are telling. The first time he is quite open and says that it's not really love and is quick to list negatives about her but no positives, then later at the party he gets irritated by it and shuts that topic down. It's not just rude answers, it's an obvious admission of lack of romantic interest.

>involved in the family when he can

I feel he is shown to have a good relationship only with his son, but at the same time he feels detached. He isn't there to vet the English tutor or the ""art therapist"" they hire, and is ignorant of a lot of things about his family. Mrs Park says that her husband knows nothing of the ""ghost"" and how it affected their son, which is another lie on her part, for example. Of course, it's her fault for lying, but it also highlights how little he is involved.

>Being trusting and naive/gullible are not evil or bad traits.

Of course they aren't, but suddenly firing someone you've trusted for years without even considering the possibility of hearing their side of the story highlights the lack of interest and respect Mrs Park had for her handmaid. All she had to do was being honest instead of telling lies, and the handmaid would have denied having tuberculosis, revealing the Kims' lies. That's her fault, lying to avoid having difficult conversations.

>I also (as explained) don’t see her short changing the son

She literally lies by saying she is paying him more than they did Min, since we see her take money out of the readied envelope. Again, this is highlighting her flaws.

>it’s hardly the crime of the century to pay a new starter a different rate of pay

Of course not, but the point is that she had no reason to do so or lie about it. 

The issue with the chaffeur is the same as the one with the handmaid: they trust this man to drive them around, quite literally putting their lives in his hands, but at the slightest possiblity of an inconvenience they immediately fire him and make up a story as to why since it would be inconvenient to actually ask him if he had sex in their car. They are also quick to jump to conclusions which seem fueled by classist stereotypes, and don't give him the benefit of the doubt over someone they've known for far less.

>I find it odd that people want to equate (even if we take your interpretation as correct) the actions of the two families.

Obviously what the Kims did is way more severe than what the Parks do, but the point is to show how the Parks aren't that different and don't resort to such extreme means only because they have no such need. In a sense, their lying is even less justified because it comes from a place of inconvenience rather than of necessity, and is less severe only by virtue of being less intentionally malicious.",dps3xy

The thing is they were so kind and welcoming and down to earth and they’d literally welcome you in open arms and they’d let you in their house, feed you and make you a bed even if they have nothing left for themselves just to make you feel welcome. Their kindness, generosity and hospitality is just unimaginable unlike so many rich and middle class people who are so selfish, so careless and so insensitive at times. Of course this isn’t generalizable.

However, once you discuss things with the poor, you find so many of the things that you find important or threatening or bad to be non issues to them. Their daily struggle to make ends meet and to survive makes them so desensitized to what we call first world problems or luxuries. Like at first I thought they’re belittling others’ issues but no, they’re not. It’s just that the life they live is so hard that the concept of having food everyday, a stable job, a home that is cold in summer and warm in winter, ongoing services like water and electricity and safety to be their life goals, while for us it’s things we take for granted, so I can never blame them for never relating to any of the things we consider problems because our problems are a luxury to them.",dps3xy

I don’t think the movie meant to imply that the Kims were wasteful, they show them indulging a little on alcohol after basically every paycheck. This doesn’t mean they’re excessive or wasteful, if anything the message it sends is that the only thing the family can spend their money on and enjoy is alcohol. The family literally cannot afford to have the luxury of protecting their home. They celebrate a little after every paycheck, but that’s not exactly the same as implying they’re a wasteful family and that the flood was some sort of punishment.

I shied away from getting a credit card for years.  But when it came time for me to buy my own car and home, I had almost zero credit.  You build your credit rating by paying off debt regularly — but a simple checking account isn’t “debt” at all.  So I got a credit card and used it for everything, paying off my balance every couple of weeks.  Years later, when I sat down to buy another car, the dealership did a credit check, and they said that my score was excellent.

But like we’re alluding to in this thread, it takes money to get into this world of making your money work for you.  When rent and food take up literally 90% of your monthly income, you can’t drop a down payment on a house, cover health insurance, start a retirement account, or buy shoes that last more than six months.  I remember early in my career when my dad said to set aside a couple hundred each month into a retirement account; I said, “Sorry, but right now, I’m lucky if I have 20 bucks left over...”

Just keep building credit until you have the credit you need for house, apartment, loans, whatever. Make sure you know if your card has cashback for certain purchases and make sure to use the cashback either towards your bill or towards a purchase, keep an eye out for cards that reward hobbies (like flyers miles, or a store you go to often has discounts, etc) that's about it, at least from what I know.

As for the second part, I agree that the main theme of the movie was to show how difficult it is to advance above your socioeconomic class and to show the differences between the classes. But it never made a case for it being impossible to climb. Min was given an excellent opportunity to do just that, he could have parlayed his tutoring into a job at mr parks company or used their connections to get into a good school, but he could only see the jobs available at the house and got greedy trying to get his parents to fill them. They showed they were talented at working those menial jobs and showed street smarts in their ability to fool the parks and position theme selves but failed to see the bigger picture.

fj0jkpb,"Guen-sae's wife WAS the housekeeper who is around 24/7, so when the family went out, they naturally had free reign. This is the same as when the Kims had drinks and snacks when the Parks went camping. The massage scene happened while the Parks were at camping and the current housekeeper was basically hostage.

However, when the new owners moved in,  Kim would not have that luxury as he is not acquainted with the new housekeeper. The housekeeper was also around 24/7 according to the dialogue, and short trips to buy groceries are not the same as being out of the house all day for work/school. For all you know the new owners got their groceries delivered to them.

Another thing to note is the relationship the rich and the poor had with technology. While the Kim's relatively poorer part of town had a bunch of unsecured WiFis, it is unlikely a tech savvy nouveau riche person like the Parks or the eventual new owners would leave a bunch of stuff unsecured. And if they did, it would also leave a digital trail to reach out to the son, which could get Kim caught.

But the whole ""a lot of people work hard, but they still don't have time"" I don't find a good excuse because at some point in their life they had time. Sure a single father or mother working 2 jobs to make ends meet, most likely isn't going to have time to start a business, but what decisions in their life did they make to get in that situation...?

Myself for example I worked a job I absolutely hated for 6 years, I worked 60+ hour work weeks, but I still managed to put myself through college, self payed my tuition... I struggled, never got a job in my field, quit my dumb delivery job making 50K a year and went to work at fedex office making $11 an hour, moved my brother in with me and my wife to make ends meet and then just got after it everyday.

Now I own an online business, I work for myself and live aboard with my wife, I made more money last year then any other time in my life. I grew up EXTREMELY poor, we use to go to salvation army for Christmas and our only car was an old pickup truck me and my sister use to ride in the back of, I mean we couldn't afford heat in the winter sometimes. My dad would ALWAYS complain about his lot in life and how he could never get ahead because of outside forces keeping him down.... it was never his fault, it was always the fault of someone else... so this is probably why I am the way I am I just saw my dad struggle and said I'm not going to do that to myself.

fjnkglv,"Going backwards, starting at the massacre at the party --

Remember that right after Kim stabbed Park, for a moment, he was in a daze, looking around at the people running, his son being carried off, and his daughter dying on the ground, when he snapped out of it and ran out of the yard and down the stairs.  He had simply snapped when he saw Park be so selfish as to take the only car for himself and not even try to get the other wounded people out of the house (the main threat, Geun-se, was dead by that point, so Park had no good reason to *not* evacuate the others).

A couple minutes earlier, when Kim and Park were hiding in the bushes to prepare their surprise, Park seemed happy to be organizing this bit of entertainment.  Kim, hoping to be included in this act of fatherly love, commented, ""You really love your family,""... but rather than respond with a Hollywood-washed, ""Yeah, Mr. Kim, I really do,"" Park turns cold and tells him, effectively, ""You're not here as a friend, you're still my driver, and I'm still your boss -- do what I tell you and that's it, capiche?""  **That's the door to the upper class being slammed in Kim's face.**

Earlier that day, fresh from finding borrowed clothes at the basketball arena-turned-refugee shelter -- and *maybe* getting a shower in the locker room -- Kim is nearly ignored by Mrs. Park as she has him drive all over town for expensive groceries and wine, treating him like a man-servant mule as she yammers on the phone with her friends about getting day-drunk and singing operatic sonnets in their rain-shower-freshened front yard.  Zero knowledge about the disaster at the bottom of the hill -- because **the Parks spend their money to stay uphill and actively maintain their ignorance**.

The night before, during their little party in the Parks' living room, the Kims pretty much agree that rich people are always nice.  Mr. Kim even shows a little humanity by wondering if the former driver and housemaid were able to score new jobs -- perhaps a mistaken assumption, though, as he seems to think that they were well-off already, being so close to the Parks by proximity alone.  But then Moon-gwang comes back, and the Kims see that she and her husband are actually even worse off -- and that the Parks simply *did not care* about what happened to their maid.  They discarded her like a moldy loaf of bread.  And that sentiment was driven home when the Kims were stuck under the table (like cockroaches) and had to listen to the Parks not only disparaging poor people, but also saying that their employees were acceptable only as long as they ""didn't cross the line"" into friendly relationships.

The preceding half of the film was mostly the Kims feeling that, just maybe this time, they were ascending the social ladder again.\*  Instead of folding pizza boxes, they got to dress a little nicer, spending time in a nice house and driving a nice car.  What they hadn't foreseen was how disposable they really were.  There's no such thing as career advancement for tutors, drivers, or housekeepers.  A clean suit worn by a private driver is simply a work uniform, just a different style than the polo shirt worn by the pizza shop manager.

\*Again -- the Kims had been better-off before, too.  Mrs. Kim has a silver medal from a national-level competition, so she knows how to work for success.  Mr. Kim tried his hand at running a business, and he probably would've done just fine if problems outside his control hadn't sunk the Taiwanese castella trend (indeed, he was better-off than Geun-se even though they both tried riding the same trend).  He also must've either owned his own car in the past, or at least worked as a driver, because he's smooth behind the wheel and doesn't even need GPS.  And I think he had even gotten into some level of lower-mid-management in the corporate world because of how comfortably he first spoke with Mr. Park.  One more thing: their apartment shows signs that they used to live in a bigger, nicer place -- they have a lot of stuff, and some of it looks like it hadn't been unpacked since they moved in.

**So the Kims have been trying to get back on the ladder for a long time.**  They've been taught, like you and I have been taught, that if they just keep grinding and working hard, they might be able to finally make it.  But that's not what happens at the end.  They get told, right to Mr. Kim's face, that they're not welcome, that they'll always be the underclass no matter how pleasantly they speak or dress, that -- by Mr. Park saying ""Throw me the keys!"" instead of, ""Pick her up and let's get out of here!"", they're not worth any more than the dead homeless lunatic laying in the yard.",dps3xy
fjrubxd,"Ok so when someone does murder what do you believe their reasoning is? Criminal circles or not (and that family is a family of criminals even if they were relatable) people murder out of fear and anger. Which is where the correlation is coming from.

Also saying oh I'd never do that doesn't mean someone else wouldn't. Maybe you're going through hard times and don't want to commit murder or scam a rich family. That does not mean other people wont or dont.
This does beyond him being just angry which may be what you're getting at. The man just saw half of his family die and then watched this man who had everything he could ever want stop helping a man because he stunk. If you watch the scene again. The rich husband is about to help the guy who just got stabbed but stopped and plugged his nose because he was too stinky. We see multiple times in the movie that he refered to the poor father as stinky. The poor dad is realizing in that moment that he is not so different from the man who just stabbed his daughter and  the rich dad would treat him the same way and snaps. Remember he just saw his daughter get stabbed, his son is bloody on someone's back and his wife was just fighting some crazed man. That sounds like a recipe for snapping and the rich man was just the icing on the cake. So you are right it is beyond being pissed but anger is usually just the outer layer of emotion.

Yes, they're telling in that he finds it an awkward conversation and doesn't know quite how to react.  Many people tailor their answers to the person asking the question as well and people sometimes people want to vent for a bit.  

>it's an obvious admission of lack of romantic interest.

And yet the actual evidence we get (of the couple in couch) shows a strong bond and romantic interest between them. Actions speak louder than words, and every action we see flies in the face of this assertion. 

>All she had to do was being honest instead of telling lies, and the handmaid would have denied having tuberculosis, revealing the Kims' lies. That's her fault, lying to avoid having difficult conversations.

It wouldn't reveal the lies because she's already been indoctrinated with the idea that the maid is trying to hide it, so lying would seem the obvious response.  Does she insist that everyone goes for blood tests to get to the bottom of the truth?  When someone who we are told is 'simple' is being skillfully manipulated and her family 'threatened'.  The idea that she should just deprogram' herself and cut through the veil of lies is just naive and victim blaming.

>She literally lies by saying she is paying him more than they did Min, 

She takes out the money that is due to Min because of the work he had done that month as Ki-Woo is taking over part way through.  That explanation makes so much more sense than this weird leap that flies in the face of every other bit of evidence we ever see Mrs Park's character.

>it would be inconvenient to actually ask him if he had sex in their car

And what if he answers 'no, I did not'?  They just believe him and walk off?  Their trust is broken, they can't continue on as they are, so they move on from him without making a scene.  It's a completely sane choice they have in that situation that is being precipitated by outside malevolent forces. 

>and don't give him the benefit of the doubt over someone they've known for far less.

In this case, it's just physical evidence, there's no accuser.  

>they trust this man to drive them around, quite literally putting their lives in his hands, but at the slightest possiblity of an inconvenience they immediately fire him 

Because that level of trust can not have doubt in it.  

The Park's being too quick to trust and extremely gullible can not be held up against the Kim's duplicitousness even in the slightest.  One is a flaw of good faith, the other is just malicious. It's blaming the host for getting the parasite. 

I obviously need to see this film again, as the case that the Park's aren't nice is far too subtle for me to get.  I just can’t seem to tap into these ideas that you all have. They might not be perfect angels but that seems an awfully high standard to hold people too.",dps3xy

5.  Kims get an opportunity to enter the Park's family one by one and there is no options but to lie & con. Ki-Taek had to do it to save his family. He finds the Parks generous and kind. 

6. The negative aspects of Parks emerge and starts to pinch him. 

7. Finds another family in the basement and learns how they too had to sneak into the Parks because of unemployment and poverty. They relate each other.

Now, the final act is much more understandable after his house gets destroyed, had to sleep homeless and then getting INGINTED again by the same negatives of Parks such as Body odor, Crossing the line etc.

Personally, I don't think you have a movie with only the first argument.

That being understood, given their destitution, it is still possible to act uprightly. It may be difficult, more difficult. But there are examples of the poor who behave better than the wealthy.

I believe the psychology of the Kim's is the most important part of the movie. Even though there is commentary on wealth disparity and social inequality, I think those are secondary and serve as frames for who the Kim's are and the mistakes they make in this particular situation.",dps3xy

This doesn’t mean they’re excessive or wasteful, if anything the message it sends is that the only thing the family can spend their money on and enjoy is alcohol. The family literally cannot afford to have the luxury of protecting their home. They celebrate a little after every paycheck, but that’s not exactly the same as implying they’re a wasteful family and that the flood was some sort of punishment. The flood just highlighted how something as simple as rain can mean things v

f76o7fu,"Okay, so we agree that the explanation is not realistic in real-life scenarios. Therefore, if that was the metaphor Bong was going for, it would have been a very weak one (and therefore, I don't think that was what was intended by him).

Good metaphors don't exist outside of the story, they exist within the story passively and come naturally (e.g. physical height is a metaphor representing class, and it also makes lot of sense in real life that the poor live in half-basements and the rich live on top of the hill).

I really think there is no real plausible link between something vague as a single thunder and Jessica getting stabbed for it to be a good metaphor.

There are much better explanations for why Bong decided put thunder at that moment:

First: the thunder was great a cinematic tool intended to break up the flow of the conversation and to signal the sharp turn the movie was about to take.

Second: thunder was necessary since from the Park house, the rain appears not too severe, and the sudden transition to the flooding neighborhood from a rainfall that is not even a thunderstorm would have seemed contrived.

Third: from the rich mansion, the rain is seen as a beautiful scenery - it almost appears as a drizzle. Right before the housekeeper arrives (which is a first domino in Kim family's downward spiral back down to a position where the rain storm, again, becomes a destructive force rather than a scenery), the clap of thunder before the sharp turn downward is a reminder that for the Kim family, the rain storm is something that should be feared, not admired.",dps3xy
faxz9qc,"Yes. I think that is all true.

But I think it's also true that the Park family looks down upon the Kim family as lesser people (evidenced by that conversation about them smelling and the wife never taking public transportation).

But either way, I don't think I will be putting any more effort into explaining it after this because explaining the same exact reasoning three times is more than enough.

Once again, there is a difference between being caring and taking an interest in an employee's well being and asking questions that are flat out rude.

Asking how someone is doing, how their family is, how a sick relative is (if this is something the employee has mentioned before), this is all great and truly shows that your coworkers care. I thankfully work in an environment where people *do* discuss things like this, and it was very very helpful when I was going through some family stuff last year. My boss and even his boss were incredibly supportive and it was awesome.

Asking if someone really loves their wife out of the blue (with an implication that they don't, at least that was my interpretation of his question at the end), that isn't ""caring"" or reasonable. That is crass and as Park says, it's crossing a line. And additionally, familiarity is a huge part of it! You don't ask someone you barely know personal questions.

Or the little details like the Parks' refrigerator being stocked with Voss bottled water.  As someone else in this thread put it, ""You know they have more money than they know what to do with if they buy cases of Voss.""

And all the mixed emotions!  It was flat-out funny how the Kims went through the whole business of framing Moon-gwang and getting her fired just like they did to the driver.  The young son teaching the dad how to act his part (funnier for Korean audiences, as the actor playing Mr. Kim is a famous A-list veteran), the peach allergy, using hot sauce as fake blood... but then we have to realize that our ""protagonists"" are falsely accusing an established employee of being infected with a communicable disease.

* Speaking of side stories, I think about the director's commentary for the ending of *Up*, for which the original idea was to flesh out the villain's motivations behind his anger -- something about a neglected childhood, things like that.  They decided that including this backstory would've put the focus on the villain instead of Carl's quest for his own closure.

Seoul's 'Beverly Hills'

Across town is the area of Seongbuk-dong. That is where the wealthy Parks’ home is set in “Parasite.” The area is home to many business families and diplomats. It is known as South Korea’s version of Beverly Hills – an extremely wealthy community in Southern California.

Unlike in Ahyeon-dong, the streets in Seongbuk-dong are clear of waste. They are also very quiet, with most homes hidden behind high walls, fences and security cameras.

Chung Han-sool heads a company called Peace Estate Agents, which sells houses. He said most of the houses in Seongbuk-dong have basements for home bars or small theaters.

Homes in the neighborhood usually cost around $6 million. Those rented to foreign diplomats are offered for $8,500 to $12,725 each month.

Chung said there are 48 ambassadors living in the neighborhood. A separate group of police officers protects them.

Even in Seongbuk-dong, signs of inequality can be seen at the “drivers’ diners” -- similar to one from “Parasite.” Although anyone can go to one of these low-cost restaurants, they got their name by serving meals to drivers, including drivers carrying the area’s wealthy residents.

“There are taxi, bus drivers and those who drive the CEOs who live around here,” said Bae Sun-young, who runs one of the drivers’ diners in Seongbuk-dong. He said the differences between the wealthy and the poor are extreme.",dps3xy

fj9ckyz,"I mean, it's not in the Mr. Kim's job description to act as a party entertainer. True, he does get paid extra, but the short talk him and Mr. Park have in the bushes lays it out explicitly that Mr. Park believes anyone under his command should do as they're told, behave according to what Mr. Park perceives as their standing, and not cross the line (also shown in the driving scene where Mr. Kim tries to act less formally by discussing their families).  

And Mrs. Park shows it too. Sure, she's simple, but she would rather fire Moon-gwang — a person who had been in the house longer than herself, and whom she trusted to run basically everything — immediately than hear her side of the story, taking as gospel the words of someone she has just met, all because he'd been recommended by someone she liked and supposedly had ties to a big company and relatives that lived in the US. Same with the driver (although we don't know how long he'd worked for them and ""his offense"" was worse).  

The Parks don't value loyalty or respect, they have no understanding of or interest in the struggles of those they deem as below them.

fhw3u4d,">Many people tailor their answers to the person asking the question as well and people sometimes people want to vent for a bit.

So, almost saying ""I don't love her"" is not an admission of not loving her? His words in the car are similar to ""I wouldn't call it love"". That's not a dismissive answer, nor an attempt at conveying that it's an uncomfortable topic, it's straight-up saying ""I don't really love my wife"".

>of the couple in couch

You know that sex doesn't necessarily equate with love, right? Also it's only Nathan who openly says he doesn't really love his wife. She may genuinely love him while he only sees her as a trophy wife, which doesn't eliminate the possibility of having sex with her, quite the opposite in fact.

>It wouldn't reveal the lies because she's already been indoctrinated with the idea that the maid is trying to hide it, so lying would seem the obvious response.

""Indoctrinated"" is quite the loaded term considering the conversation she had with Kim cannot have been longer than a few minutes, an hour if we're generous. It's not like he spent months gaslighting her. 

Also if the handmaid knew of the accusations, she could produce a blood test to disprove them. But since she was fired with a different excuse, she never got the chance to make her case. 

>That explanation makes so much more sense than this weird leap that flies in the face of every other bit of evidence we ever see Mrs Park's character.

She says, loudly, that she's paying Ki-Woo more than she did with Min. No matter the rationalisation of Ki-Woo starting halfway through the month (which is never stated in the movie), she's still lying to his face. She doesn't tell him what you say, she tells him he's getting extra pay while we're shown the opposite is true.

>And what if he answers 'no, I did not'? They just believe him and walk off? Their trust is broken, they can't continue on as they are, so they move on from him without making a scene. It's a completely sane choice they have in that situation that is being precipitated by outside malevolent forces. 

I'm not denying the Kims' responsibilities, I'm just saying that the movie highlights how the Parks are just as quick as the Kims in seeking the easy way out. Instead of making a scene, they decide to conjure up an alternative story for firing the chaffeur (despite ""you had sex with someone in our car"" being obviously unprofessional and thus a legit claim for firing someone) because ""making a scene"" is slightly inconvenient to them.

>The Park's being too quick to trust

They are quick to trust, but they are also incredibly quick to discard people. It's evident that they see their direct employees, people they spend time with and supposedly place trust in, as easily replaceable and irrelevant. Mrs Park's refusal to look at ""Kevin""'s resume is another facet of this: she only cares he was recommended by Min, and through this connection they keep hiring people who get recommend without ever bothering to ask questions despite their grandiose claims of fame and past employments. They prefer appearance over substance, which is a quite glaring flaw and cannot be dismissed as purely naiveté.

A lot of this is obvious in how Da-song is treated by his mother: it's quite clear that he's not a budding artist as much as his mother says, and she projects a lot of her desires over him. She **wants** her son to be special, so once he shows an interest in drawing she immediately latches onto it and makes a gigantic deal out of it.",dps3xy
