I've listened to the original broadway soundtrack of In the Heights countless times, so I was slightly jarred when some of the musical numbers were either cut or shuffled around. I'm pretty forgiving about this, so it's really not that big a deal to me. However, I was absolutely blown away at how ""Paciencia Y Fe"" was completely recontextualized by the slight tweaking of one or two lyrisc at the end of it. I'm curious about how others felt, but this totally worked for me.

h1ehjpb,This musical adaptation really benefited from shooting on location. Whereas some other musicals are filmed on sets and sound stages the real-life element really justified this being made into a live action feature film,nx3jdq
h1d1nk6,"This is what a movie musical should be. 

All the best parts of the stage show, but enhanced with the language of film. The heightened and immediate emotionality that theatre thrives on can be incredibly difficult to replicate in movies, but this somehow manages it in a way only movies can. 

Honestly, the only complaints I have are stupid nitpicks that have to do with my own preferences. For example, I *love* ""Inútil"" in the original because I really love Kevin's struggle as a father, and thought it would be a very moving moment in the show (especially since he's now a single father), but the song is cut entirely. I understand why they had to since the Rosario family story is largely the thing they cut down to get the runtime down to a reasonable length, but I still miss it. 

Overall, the movie is great. The cast is phenomenal. The movie just soars along and is an absolute joy to watch. 

Some moments even stood out for me that hit even harder than the stage show, like the cuts to people desperately checking their lottery tickets/praying during ""96,000."" The song was always happy/hopeful/exciting, but that moment - literally just a couple of shots - added an entire new dimension to the song that supercharged the overwhelming emotion of the song. 

Oh, and ""Paciencia y Fe"" hits like a truck, even moreso than it does on stage. An entire song about her working her ASS OFF her entire life, never taking the easy way out, only to end with her choosing the stairs instead of the ramp -still not taking the easy way - as she passes. Oof.

Just incredible work. Loved it.",nx3jdq
h1cmzu8,"Scattershot thoughts:

Loved Anthony Ramos as Usnavi. He’s just so charming and fits the role perfectly. 

Benny, Vanessa, and Sonny were also great. 

Listening to the soundtrack so many times, it’s clear they slowed a few things down, tweaked some lyrics, and pitched things to fit the ranges of the actors. I think all of the changes were fine. It took a while to get used to Nina’s voice, as the original stage actress is an absolute powerhouse, but I think she pulls it off. 

The change of Nina’s mother having passed away was a good tweak to the story.

Loved the “beach” reveal at the end. Nice touch. 

The pacing of the final act gets a little weird. They fly through so much time in a short time. 

Overall, it was just so much fun. The music is great. The story is moving. Great visuals. It’s a warm feel-good 2 hours. Solid 8/10.",nx3jdq

h1crf32,"To me, this was a movie about the inherent tension that early generation Americans feel in this country and how to address it. Most of the arcs start in a place of avoidance. Usnavi and Nina are avoiding it by retreating to their roots. Vanessa is avoiding it by leaning into assimilation. However, by the end, these three all end up in a place where they're dealing with it head on. Usnavi and Vanessa start their community project and business to keep the culture alive in Washington Heights. Nina continues on with school so that she can fight the racism she's been subjected to and sees others subjected to.",nx3jdq

h1d3j2o,"Okay, I have a question for the folks who have *only* seen the movie version:

What were your thoughts on the lottery winner reveal? Because in the original show, the winner is revealed during >!Paciencia y Fe!<, way earlier than what was shown here. In fact, pretty much every song after that point references the winner and thus there were quite a few changed lyrics in the movie to keep the secret. Specifically, entire sections were cut from >!Blackout!< and >!Carnaval del Barrio!<.

Basically I want to know if the delayed reveal actually worked and surprised first time viewers, since it's no longer a surprise to those who saw the show or just listened to the OBC first.",nx3jdq
h1glk6d,"Just want to say how nice it is that a movie musical put real effort into having good dancers and choreography. So many musicals now will do celebrity stunt castings and have the cut around all of the choreo as a result of not hiring strong dancers.

It also really embraced the fact that it was a movie and could do things that a stage show can’t. The use of space, camera placement, and heightened reality sequences really made this stand out as an experience separate from the Broadway production. This movie really succeeds in that respect where a lot of recent musical-to-movie adaptations fail IMO",nx3jdq

h1co4oo,"Loved the movie though I’m still sad they chose to reduce Sunrise to a melody that didn’t even really go with the scene.

All in all 10/10 a wonderful movie/musical experience.",nx3jdq
h1g1rad,"One thing I’m bummed about this version is Benny’s ending. In the ending of the play, Nina hasn’t left yet and we see them together during the finale and we also see him embracing with Usnavi.

In this version, he just disappears after “When The Sun Goes Down”. Feels like he got the crappiest hand dealt for a main character.",nx3jdq
h1ct49s,[removed],nx3jdq
h2lo0ak,"Disclaimer; straight white guy here so my real life experience may not be applicable but I feel like people saying the movie showed gentrification as some lighthearted or inevitable thing missed a lot of the movie.

So sure, Usnavi and Vanessa end up running the bodega in Washington Heights but who else has a happy ending?

The salon ladies are pushed up the Bronx because they can't afford rent anymore. Kevin Rosario sells the business he spent his entire life building just so Nina can have a shot to escape.

Sonny has an incredibly difficult legal battle to get legal status and even then it's a long shot. 

Abuela Claudia finally gets the chance to go home but it's too late and she passes away without ever getting back to see the birds of La Vibora.

Even Usnavi's ""happy ending"" is him giving up his lifelong dream to help Sonny fight his legal battle and try to share Abuela Claudia's story so she's not forgotten.

Just because Vanessa and Usnavi had a kid and ran the bodega doesn't mean it's a happy ending. Everyone in the entire movie has given up on their dream of escaping or been forced out by the end of the movie.",nx3jdq

h2etsgu,"Heard the casting criticisms before watching it. After seeing it, yeah I see that the main cast is mostly mestizo. Saw Afro folks in neighborhood shots and dance numbers, I didn't come away feeling like Washington Heights was only full of lightskins based on the movie. Like with any set of strong opinions, the truth is somewhere in the middle.

I enjoyed the hell out of it. My SO and I, both of us 1st generation Hispanic, saw a lot of our own journeys in those of the characters — leaving home, figuring out what home even is, trying to ""make it,"" being a fish out of water in mainstream America, all of it. And folks in our lives are in the film's characters, too. As an overall grab bag of Hispanic experiences, it really resonates. Is it true enough and specific enough to the actual Washington Heights, though? That much I can't say, I've never been.",nx3jdq
h1d9m1s,"Good goddamn, *Paciencia y Fe* is going to win an Oscar, isn't it? Everything about it, from Olga Merediz's expression of fear to her finally accepting her peace, to the dancers in 1950s attire, to the rainbow subway-- it's all just... *chef's kiss*

h1gjcjv,"The ""Fire Escape"" song and dance towards the end. Jesus, that was beautiful.",nx3jdq
h1pjg6s,"This movie doesn't make sense as an adaptation. It's difficult not to compare an adaptation to the original. I saw the play years ago on Broadway and really enjoyed it but did not enjoy this movie. Large parts of the plot were moved around or removed completely. While other parts were drawn out that didn't need to be. 

From a musical perspective removing songs changes the story. When the sun goes down doesn't make sense with out the sunrise song. Sunrise develops Nina and Benny's relationship by exploring the differences between the two characters and how their relationship can still work. Hundreds of stories develops Usnavi's dream in a way no other song does, removing it doesn't help the story. So much added dialogue is about Usnavi's dream when it could be explained more efficiently in this song that was removed. This piragua song is less important without the short reprise so why keep one but not the other?

The re-order of plot parts makes certain important parts of the plot seam rushed while others are drawn out unnecessarily. For example we spend time focusing on Benny's work goals if the first half of the movie but in the second half he is just Nina's boyfriend. The protest scene seems added in and out of place. A lot of the dialogue could have been cut while allowing the music to tell the story because there is good story telling in the songs. With the additional plot lines the movie can be a mess because it doesn't have the time to explain and develop all it is trying to do. Also the additions increase the runtime without increasing the story to a similar degree.

The movie by itself can be ok but overall is messy. Compared to the original it is an unfortunate adaptation.",nx3jdq
h1qga46,"I think one of my favorite moments was during the blackout when they sing about being Powerless.

I also thought it was a nice touch when the power was going out that in the distance ""downtown"" the power never goes out. It really just drove home the point being made all movie that the Heights can be invisible and irrelevant to the richer parts of Manhattan.",nx3jdq

h1ebbah,"So… I adore everything about this movie. It perfectly adapts the medium from stage to screen, is acted phenomenally, perfectly edited, gorgeously shot, unapologetically musical, excellent VFX, and the sound design is on a whole other level. I cannot stress enough this is how movie musicals should be done, and this movie should be the template for it all.",nx3jdq
h1kjypq,"Movie met all my expectations.

I just wish “inútil” made it. That actor portrayed the role so well too it would have been perfect",nx3jdq
h21zpaf,Wow. Apparently Daniela and Carla were supposed to be lesbians? Honestly did not get that vibe at all. I think if they had maybe kept the nail salon ladies without the addition of Cuca (who added nothing imo) then maybe it would have been more obvious? But the clear framing of them as a trio and Daniela as the lead makes her seem more like a mother figure to the two of them vs as a partner to Carla. It just doesn’t work.,nx3jdq
h2u8bup,"I think the cinematography hit the perfect note of magical realism for this material. It’s hard to make a movie musical work in the 21st century, and I think they did an amazing job conveying the electric, dynamic feel of a live stage performance while creating a universe in which the singing/dancing seems organic. 

It’s rare that I connect to pretty much every character (especially in an ensemble piece like this with a lot of characters vying for screen time), but I did here. There were no weak links in the cast at all.",nx3jdq
h1gpvau,I came out of the movie with a giant crush on Melissa Barrera,nx3jdq
h1owwoj,"This will probably get lost but I loved the outfits in the movie. It was incredibly realistic. Nina, when she first arrives, is wearing a $15 forever 21 green romper that I own! Also, girls were wearing hollister shorts and usnavi was wearing a hollister shirt. That made it feel very realistic to me.",nx3jdq
h1ggf41,The hold music when the dad was calling Stanford was the melody from the kings songs in Hamilton. Nice little Easter egg.,nx3jdq
h1ik2a3,"As someone familiar with the stage show, I loved the movie for all its artistry and heart and even the things it added. I am a bit disappointed, though, about a couple things they removed.

I understand why they switched around the reveal of Abuela winning the lottery for the adjusted storyline, but expecting the tension of that reveal and then not getting it was a jarring letdown (though it seems it worked fine for those who weren’t previously familiar). Knowing every word to the original songs didn’t help with that either.

My main issue is the removal of most of the conflict between Nina/her dad/Benny. The conflict with her dad got resolved way too quickly; I think adding back his song Inútil would have helped flesh this out. There was essentially no conflict between Nina and Benny, which I think made their characters seem rather flat (particularly Benny).

In the stage show, they’ve never really been a couple because Nina’s dad doesn’t like Benny (largely because he’s black — as others have pointed out, this other aspect of racism could have been good to touch on). They have a huge fight at the club, but then make up overnight during the blackout. They sleep together and sing a phenomenal song (Sunrise), part of which discusses breaking the news of their relationship to Nina’s dad.

Without this conflict and resolution, Nina and Benny seemed like side characters, when in the stage show, it’s honestly Usnavi and Vanessa who are less prominent (though not by much). They also, like I said, fell a bit flat for me.

Also, without Sunrise, the line in Carnaval del Barrio about them rolling in the hay doesn’t make a lot of sense. In the stage show, that’s when the cat gets out of the bag. In the movie it’s like... well yeah? They’re dating? Why should that be shocking to anyone? Not really a “no me diga” moment.",nx3jdq
h1ldhf6,"The club bartender is played by Seth steward, the original graffiti Pete from broadway",nx3jdq
h1zmy3p,"I was concerned going into this movie because of all the outrage and thinking it wouldn't meet expectations. I saw the play, know the soundtrack, know Washington Heights and was prepared to be disappointed. 

Honestly, the movie was great and they definitely made some updates and adjustments which were for the most part ok to fit the times and be less on the nose(the looting scene, racial conflict and some other stuff). Some songs were cut and plot points needed to be expanded on, but did a decent job overall. Sonny and Abuela were my favorite characters and had the best parts in my opinion where things got really emotional and heartfelt. 

The CGI was awful in some parts but that can be because of the fantasy nature of some scenes where it seemed deliberately cheesy. The bad CGI gum on Usnavi's shoe where he spins a manhole is an example and can take you out of the film. Same goes for the lip-syncing in some scenes where it breaks that suspension of belief. Definitely needed more of Benny and Nina. 

And to address the controversy about the lack of Afro Dominicans. The actor that plays Nina identifies as Afro Dominican, but the same people criticizing would say that she isn't Afro Dominican or is not representative because of how she looks, which is problematic in itself. 

I get it, Washington Heights is very diverse, but there are a lot of different people from different backgrounds, and the film did a great job of hammering that point home. And unless you get a 23 and Me, you wouldn't be able to tell anything and even then it's an issue because DNA results don't define people. That was a solid representation of a slice of Washington Heights in the High Bridge area.

I think Lin Manuel is gonna complete his EGOT. Whether it be the score, original song...or dare I say Best Picture? I think it'll be a contender in awards season. You can tell how much this movie means to him.

Whenever I see a movie musical there's a few minutes where I have to get into the right state of mind and get through the initial cheesiness and give in. Once you do that it's an absolute blast.

Acting was on point. Anthony Ramos should become a star after this. I wonder how many people will see Stephanie Beatriz in this and not realize this is how she sounds in real life lol

I wanted to go college, not just for me but for my parents. Like Nina I felt alot of pressure to succeed because of how much my parents sacrificed so that I can reach heights they couldn't. Sonny's realization that college might not be in the cards gave me emotional whiplash because I know what that feels like. I'm not the biggest fan of musicals but seeing a blockbuster level movie represent someone like me for once left me feeling seen for the first time in a long time.",nx3jdq
h1dbqb7,"The exchange where Sonny tells Nina he wanted to go to college like her brought the watery eyes.  Then the movie just…didn’t quit.  Every scene in that final act felt cathartic. 

Also, did Dascha Polanco just really wanna be in this movie?  When I saw they added a character for her, I thought it made sense because she’s one of the more recognizable faces…but she barely has any lines.  Kinda love that she was just like “put me in it and you can use me for marketing”.",nx3jdq

h1o9ygu,"After intentionally avoiding reading about the play/listening to the music, seeing this on Friday (and making plans to watch it in theatres when they finally open up again) and reading/responding to people's comments here there seems to be a general divide between those wanting to judging ""In the Heights"" either versus the musical or film/stories in general (i.e. plot/character development, etc.) and those who are just grinning ear-to-ear and wrapped up in the experience that those other things really don't matter as much.

I think for the late teens to late 20s/early 30s kids of immigrants (especially those growing up in heavily or predominately immigrant areas) just being able to recognise the people, faces, and places from your own experience on the screen is (to quote the title of a supposedly cut number from this play) ""enough"" to get you emotionally invested in the characters and plot(s) that you're willing (or even unaware) of the alleged character or plot underdevelopment. This, I think, is for two reasons:

a) maybe it's 'cause you're so wrapped up (again) in seeing those people, faces, and places you grew up with/know so well being celebrated (instead of demonised and inaccurately portrayed) on the screen (even it is a bit romanticised and idealised, but hey, it's a musical right? In real life, people don't just randomly break out in song and dance lol) and/or;

b) you're probably filling in the gaps of that alleged character or plot underdevelopment based on your own life experiences and so certain things that may need to be explained by the characters or plot for the sake of a strong storyline and film don't need to be explained to you in order to make inferences and connect things together

Either way, although I personally enjoyed the music of ""Hamilton"" better, I like/connected with ""In the Heights"" more because of that personal resonance (despite what may be, on the surface or objectively) it's weaker characters/music/plot. Anyways, have thoroughly enjoyed reading people's responses good/bad/or ugly as long as, another playwright once famously said, ""We speak what we feel, not what we *ought* to say."" Cheers!",nx3jdq

h1cltdn,"Well this was just delightful. Colorful, upbeat, amazing choreography, lots of cool stuff going on technically, and some great characters and moments for them to shine. 

I'm not familiar with this show but I do have a soft spot for musicals, so I had little doubt that I'd enjoy this. The director is a great choice for it and Miranda's musicals just have great movement to them. Songs bleed into one another in a way that keeps the pace up and keeps things from getting too repetitive with choruses or breaks and lulls. 

I mean look at the night out clubbing sequence. You have the dances and the Vanessa song, and that goes right into the blackout, which goes right into abuela's goodbye song. Before you know it it's been 20 minutes and the plot hasn't stopped moving. In that sense this movie didn't feel its length which is great because it is a little long. 

That said, this movie still knew when to slow it down, stop the music, and let the characters have their moments. Vanessa being denied for the apartment, Nina deciding to go back to school, finding out Sonny was undocumented, the scene where Nina talks about getting searched, these scenes in another musical may have had swelling arrangements but here we are able to just feel with the characters for a moment and not be pushed along by song and dance and that really let those moments pack a punch for me. 

Overall I'd give this an easy 8/10. Could even turn into a 9 on rewatches once I know the songs and lyrics. And who knows? Maybe this will mark the beginning of the Jimmy Smitsaissance.

There was definitely less emphasis on Abuela this time which is kind of a bummer (although technically I guess *less* of a bummer narratively speaking).  Kind of weird how the lottery plotline was almost an afterthought. A couple of lyrics didn’t make sense considering the changes, but not really a big deal. I did like the framing of an older Usnavi telling the story to his daughter. My biggest complaint of the musical is that it just kind of… ends. The movie did a good job of fleshing it out a little more.

The performances were great and I loved the choreography, especially some of the more surreal elements.

I also have worked as a professional musical theatre actor and have been in/seen countless musicals in my life. Through that time, in the heights has always been my favorite. 

Here are my thoughts of the movie: 

Overall I loved it. 9/10. But that isn't to say there weren't things that didn't work or that they changed from the stage version. 

First, they killed off Nina's mom. I personally really didn't like this change. She had a pretty big part in the musical and they had to rewrite some lyrics with her being out. 

On stage, there is no story about Vanessa wanting to be a designer. That was all new. I liked it. It gave motivation to Vanessa as a character as for why she wanted to break out of the heights. Good change I'd say. 

Sonny also wasn't mentioned to be undocumented in the show. Also new for the movie and I think it added a nice new element to the struggles of the Latino community that lives there. Good change. 

In the musical there is no mention of Daniella and Carla being together that I remember. I'm all for inclusion of LGBTQ+ characters, but with their age difference and their characters' personalities, I just don't see those two making sense. Not my favorite change. 

Also in the musical, there is no mention of Usnavi's dad's bar. That was added in this I believe as a narrative device that usnavi could tell his story and give his asides to the kids. In the musical those are directly to the audience. 

Now here is the BIG change. In the musical, Abuela Claudia reveals she won the 96k lottery in act 1. She explains to Usnavi that she has the ticket during the blackout. (In the musical the blackout is handled differently. There are threats of looting and shooting in the streets and Abuela wants to make sure the ticket is safe). 

This changed SO MUCH of the movie. They had to rewrite dozens of lines about Usnavi and the money. It ended up cutting out some amazing music because of the change too (particularly ""there's a little beach named playa Rincon"", ""were gonna leave a third of the money to you sonny"", and ""it really said U.S. navy, but hey""). It also really changes Usnavi's decision about whether to go or stay. In the movie he was already set on leaving. I believe in the show the lottery is what gives him the means to leave. 

So a lot of the lyrical changes I also did not like, just because I am used to the original, but they had to be done because the reveal of the lottery didn't happen until the end. 

Also in the musical, usnavi doesn't give his money to fight for Sonny's citizenship. It was agreed to go 33% to Abuela, Usnavi, and Sonny I believe. 

 I prefer the musical's reveal of the lottery ticket earlier in the show. 

Lastly, they cut out some songs that are on the original broadway cast recording album if you want to hear them! I highly recommend listening through both albums if you plan to listen to the music! 

I have a ton of thoughts about the choreography, cinematography, casting, and performances, but I will save them for another comment because this one is getting long. Plus I really just wanted to point out some of the major differences from the show for people that might not know!",nx3jdq
h1d58z9,"I expressed several time In the Heights and The Green Knight were my most anticipated movies of 2020, so both of these films have big expectations. How did In the Heights do? There's no easy way to say this, but this movie is a 10/10. The French Dispatch, Dune, Last Night in Soho, and The Green Knight  better look out! 

# TL;DR: This is the movie of the summer, possible of the year. Go watch it. 

Okay so where to start. I have never seen the Broadway show, but I have listened to the soundtrack several times. Overall, the only song I truly lament is gone is ""Everything I Know."" It makes me tear up, specially since Nina has always been my favorite character. Now, onto the actual movie:

&#x200B;

As a mention this is a 10/10. On the serious side, the movie is a great illustration of the struggles immigrants face thru generations which I won't discuss too much to avoid spoiling people. But the one I find most interesting is Nina, because I have been in her shoes, and as soon as ""Breathe"" came on I was already tearing up. As for the rest, I was afraid this big ensemble wouldn't translate well to the big screen with a limited run time. No need for worries! Rubin-Vega, Beatriz, and Polanco are a stand out as supporting characters. The movies provide plenty of motivation and depth for its major players, Usnavi, Nina, Vanessa, Abuela, Sonny, and Kevin. Not all of them get a lot of screen time, but when they do, you understand their character's motivations. Most importantly, all of them are perfectly cast.  Sonny, tells you everything you need to know with the time he is given, and when the reveal at the end happens, his characters just clicks, particularly his verse in ""96,000."" 

&#x200B;

Now, speaking of ""Breath"" and ""96,000,"" how are the musical numbers? 

The movie oozes creativity. The opening number, I am surprise how much I enjoyed considering it happens entirely in the store, likewise, ""No Me Diga"" could have been a boring number in a salon, but is so entertaining and funny to watch, and the movie is populated by funny moments. Vanessa's number with the fabric falling out of the sky and her running thru an empty street is beautifully frame. It makes you feel anything is possible and desperation at the same time. This perfect balance of hope and hopelessness. 

From that dinner scene until ""Paciencia y Fe"" I can confidently say the movie is perfection. The aforementioned song is just a punch to the stomach. The sequence is so beautifully. I don't if the director meant this, but placing the song in the subway is a great way to illustrate feeling trapped, but having no option as to move forward as an immigrant. ""Carnaval del Barrio"" is fun. However, ""When the Sun Goes Down"" is a stand out. That choreography, and the place it happens is gorgeous.

&#x200B;

h2an4gy,"I was pleasantly surprised with this film. Had low expectations but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It’s by no means a masterpiece, and the songs are a bit forgettable, but I don’t at all regret paying for tickets. I tested up at the Abuela number, which was the emotional highlight of the movie. I feel kinda bad but I didn’t really care about Usnavi? I wish he had left for the DR instead lol.",nx3jdq

h1lbjf4,"The visuals were great and eye-catching, the way film adaptations of musicals should be. It was definitely a bit on the long side, but overall pretty charming and feel-good.

I did think it was structurally weird to have Abuela's death happen earlier in the story. Revealing that she died immediately after the Carnaval sequence made for a massive emotional punch that the movie was missing.

That post-credits scene was also fun and a nice way to tie up the Piraguero's mini-storyline, as that reprise wouldn't really fit the way they restructured the rest of the film.",nx3jdq
h21xq0o,"Am I. . .am I going insane?

Look, full disclosure: I'm a white dude from Texas, so I'm not going to have the same kind of emotional connection that someone whose from this specific neighborhood or a part of these specific cultures will. I admit that fully. 

. . .but I watch a *lot* of movies, and I love musicals. And I was a tap dancer for a lot of years. And, *hoooooly shiiiiiiit* this was just grating. Every musical sequence is exactly the same - repetitive music, typically one phrase repeated over and over again, that someone PG raps over, or sings another song about ""we've gotta be proud of our community!"" Like, that's a fine message but almost every song? It also feels very pat and safe, because there's no recognizable anger or viscera in the film - it's a movie made of corporate slogans. But if it isn't that, it's a Disney-esque song about following your dreams and finding out where you belong, and I thought we escaped that era ten years ago. 

The dancing, save for the pool scene and Abuela's death hallucination, is just too clean and commonly unmotivated - I know, I know. It's a musical. But, there's like. . .four scenes in this film at least where someone just bombs up into a scene and goes ""let's dance!"" and everyone dances. On top of that, look - every film is a magic trick and a lie, by nature of what it is. Especially in a musical, we as an audience buy into the artifice going in, and we accept the rules you present to us about the world we see as elements of immersion. There are two moments in this film that completely break that immersion, and one of them is when characters start walking on walls like Spider-Man. It's not a dream sequence, and we know this because other characters witness it and react to it and the film doesn't mention it again. 

Come to think of it, everything and everyone in this film is too clean and sanitized. Everyone has absolutely perfect skin and clothes. There's no sweat (even in a blackout, somehow). There's no trash on the streets or homeless people. There's no grit or heft or reality to the world we're presented with at all - which, for a film that exists to champion and show off a very real neighborhood and real people with real emotions, cries out for it as a necessity. 

The characters are all just kind of. . .one note. They've each got one core simplistic moral dilemma that the film just milks as much as it can, but outside of that they're just plucky and resilient in the face of anything. Which is fine, but it doesn't make a character necessarily well-rounded. What we see of their drama is CW teen drama level ""will they or won't they"" type of stuff. Which really isn't that involving. We've seen this type of stuff before in a million places, in afterschool specials and in a bajillion nineties films when ""taking pride in your community"" became a genre of its own. 

Speaking of which, Nina? Incredibly ungrateful. Dad gives up everything for you and pays your way to one of the most prestigious schools in the entire country, and you're gonna give him shit for it? Because you got searched and white people are assholes? I mean yeah, no shit. But have some self-awareness, lady. This isn't coming from a snobby rich white kid, by the way - I'm from a really, really, *really* poor family that didn't have a business they could've sold to get me through school. 

The only scenes I found remotely involving were Abuela's hallucination before dying, because at least *finally* there was a scene where someone approaching a real person sang a song that expressed an emotion more complicated than ""I'm in love and I rep for my hood, but also I have big dreams and don't know where I belong,"" and the opening scene, because it has a stylistic zest and a verve the rest of the film is missing entirely. 

Honestly, please. I'm asking - someone explain to me what I'm missing.",nx3jdq
h1cy4gc,"In the Heights will always be special to me because during quarantine I have delved into the world of YouTube bootlegs of musicals. In the Heights was the second one I seen after being recommended it (The first being the Spongebob musical, thanks to Reddit). It was refreshing see a positive, upbeat look at Hispanics, I myself being Puerto Rican. 

Through out the whole show I was smiling from ear to ear. The music, the staging, the choreography was phenomenal! Kudos to Jon M. Chu for having style. The various camera flourishes and cuts made every song feel like a music video. 

I did have a few issues with the movie though. Sonny’s dad and Cuca didn’t add anything to the plot.  The storytelling framing took me out a few times and felt distracting. Also, I wasn’t crazy about Corey Hawkins singing at all in contrast to everyone not liking Leslie and/or Melissa.

The biggest problem I had was Blackout being so underwhelmed and gutted. The Vanessa/Usnavi argument was nowhere near emotional as the originals’ Benny/Nina one. It was also very rushed and disjointed which was disappointing because the beginning of the song visually look great. 

Thank god that it is followed by the best 1, 2 punch of song and performance. Olga deserves all the awards she’s eligible for. Paciencia y Fe is such a heart breaker of a song and it’s new place is perfect. Alabanza and Carnival de Barrio is just so cathartic and beautiful I was in tears the whole time, sad then happy.

All in all, it was amazing and I’ll definitely be rewatching as soon as I can on HBO Max. I was so glad to make this my first post-pandemic movie theater trip. Don’t forget to stay for the after credits scene!

h1d602a,"In the Heights is my favorite Broadway musical of all time, the soundtrack got me through some shitty times, so I really wanted it to be good. Thank God it was. Really can't fault the vast majority of their decisions here. The Dreamers storyline was the perfect amount and the changes necessitated by that insertion felt pretty natural.

Then all the additions they made. The big musical numbers were sensational. Holy crap the choreography overall in this movie is out of control good. Having them do a dream ballet for When The Sun Goes Down might be a bit superfluous but the actual choreo and direction is -chef's kiss-. This movie blows La La Land out the water in that regard.

Chris Jackson's cameo is still my favorite part, even after watching it over and over in the trailer. I knew it was unlikely but I was really hoping they'd do the reprise. Oh well. Still 10/10 for me.

h1d618v,"I liked the movie overall as a huge fan of the musical. I have to say though, i've always felt that Nina is more the main character of the musical, or at least as important as Usnavi, and the movie severely short changed her. They trimmed down her part so much to add room for Vanessa and Sonny, and that is traced back to focusing more on Usnavi as both the main character and framing device. In the musical, Nina has way more development and songs than Vanessa, and is stronger for it. Her whole relationship with Benny is less impactful because of the key songs they cut. It also lessens Abuela Claudia's impact because they cut the song referencing her relationship to everyone (but especially Nina) in ""Everything I Know"".

Nina's struggle was just way more engaging in the show than anything the movie made up for Vanessa and i'm sorry to see it cut.",nx3jdq
h26vzsj,"I actually have yet to be disappointed in theaters with all these films being released. 



The streak continues, I saw the Broadway back in  09' which was my first one as well! I only had high hopes after that trailer that they could pull off the film adaption. Visually, they nailed it and the dance choreography was insanely good. The music never fell out of place aside from my nitpick between the exchange Usnavi and Kevin the beginning, it felt weird. 
It's clear that the songs are the main hook as any musical is and the movie just drowns you in songs for better or worse, I very much enjoyed them in the 1st watch in theaters and realizing how little breathing room there is between songs in the 2nd. It works on a Broadway because it's live, actors are going all out with their vocals and the focus is dead on. Also, Blackout, 96k and When The Sun goes Down were easily the visual standouts in the film, Blackout especially.

I felt like the main cast did a great job, Nina and Benny had stand out moments with their actors but I do wish they gave them a few more scenes together. By the very end I actually don't think I saw Benny after Nina leaving which is unfortunate. Usnavi and Vanessa were fine, I like Ramos but I blame nostalgia for not letting me fully admire him as Usnavi. Vanessa I think was a little better by adding her an artist background because I barely remember her involvement in the Broadway outside of being the love interest for the main lead. Barrera took a few days to grow on me and now I think I like this version more. My personal favorites were Sunny and Abuela Claudia, I actually wasn't expecting Gregory to make Sunny as charming as he was. He was a good character for younger viewers to attach themselves which works well when the story is all about heritage. I did find the inclusion if his father to be strange since we never see him again after his introduction.
Olga Merediz didn't get as much screentime as I wanted like she did in the original but she still nailed her role again after all these years, she's absolutely irreplaceable which makes me dread the future of the film adaption possibly receiving a modern update in the possible 20 years or less. Her song is always going to remain my favorite in both versions right above 96k. 

The rest of the cast had their moments, Daniela and the girls were as entertaining as they were in the original, Kevin was less of jerk, Graffiti Pete had a little more involvement but I am sad he didn't do the Abuela mural but the beach was a solid replacement.




Story wise it's not hard to follow, there's less plot lines going on to fit that 2 hours and 23 minute limit. I'm sad they took out Nina's Mom from the film because she has that great song about how Nina and Kevin's arguments are driving her insane, causing them to fix their issues. I can see why they took her out if they couldn't get her song in the film though. I would say only the story is the weakest link as the story gets carried by the acting and music which is really a bad thing. 


Overall, I loved it for what it was, a film like this is appropriate for this day and age. I'm sad that there's controversy that will surely hinder viewership at some point because In The Heights is a wonderful tale.",nx3jdq

Not sure if it’s just a musical thing or not but it’s kind of rare for full applause from a theatre.

Plus the chatter during the credits was very very positive on the second viewing tonight.

Hopefully word of moth does the trick and it has long legs.",nx3jdq
h1hiptm,I thought Stephanie Beatriz as Carla was hilarious after seeing her as Rosa on Brooklyn 99,nx3jdq
h873zl7,"Definitely one of the better directed ""feel-good"" movie. The music, the sounds, the abundance of cheerful colors gave something truly special. 

The casting was great! Anthony Ramos definitely will be a superstar and I might've developed a slight crush on Melissa Barerra. And Olga Merediz as Abuela was just delightful (her death is something I was goddam WEEPING like a little girl, a second movie right after ""Hachiko a dog story"" to make me do this).  

That being said... the story was such a slog. As a white guy from Europe I understand the importance of showing the struggles of the latino community in America and I'm happy that such film came to life but I can't help but feel that it could've been done better. Ramos as Usnavi stole the show from the very first second and in all honesty his story was everything I cared about - Both Benny and Nina and Daniela were just... bland. I don't know if it's the casting fault or maybe my own self-absorbed ass couldn't sympathize with them, but yeah... more than once I've found myself skipping through some of their parts. 

That being said this movie is 80% journey in a GODDAMN AGONIZINGLY SLOW PACE only to finish the last 10% like it's some sort of deathrace. The balance was waaaaay, way off. That's also a solid minus. 

Overall... I was enchanted with the trailers (as a guy who never saw the original show) and some of that magic was still present. The music is definitely the biggest positive (still humming the tunes of ""The Club"" as I write this) and the rest was more or less acceptable. A solid 7/10, definitely a movie to watch more than once.",nx3jdq
h1o6ug2,"Some songs didn’t really fit well. My three favorite parts are 96,000, the blackout and Nina and Benny wall dancing. Overall I give it about 7.5 out of 10",nx3jdq
h1mr9xz,"In the Heights was the first musical I ever saw on Broadway in New York. It had just come out the year prior and I didn’t know anything about it. I went in blind and really enjoyed it. 

Unfortunately, I didn’t have the same fresh eyes going into this movie and I think it ultimately hampered my overall opinion on it. It ended up being a mixed bag for me. I loved some of the big production numbers. 96,000, for example, was a lot of fun. Developing Sonny was a plus for me too. But one of my favorite songs and moments from the stage show, Blackout, I don’t feel translated very well here. It didn’t have the same sense of drama, chaos, and panic as the original. And to be nitpicky, some of the new lyric changes and general editing felt kinda clunky to me. 

I thought Anthony Ramos did a really nice job and it was great to see Olga Merediz reprise her role! She was in the cast I saw on Broadway. It’s really satisfying seeing how she’s been able to develop and refine this role over the years. I can’t imagine another Abuela Claudia. 

All in all, I’d give it a 6.5 or so. Not the worst musical adaptation out there by any means, but not one I’ll be clamoring to rewatch anytime soon.",nx3jdq

h1cpsti,"I was so hyped as a fan of the Broadway soundtrack, and figured I would just be disappointed. But I'm far from it. Absolutely amazing, save for one shot that looked like it had to be a reshoot on a green screen. Other than that the shots were amazing, the singing and choreography were on point. Anthony Ramos did a phenomenal job as expected, but I was actually shocked by Corey Hawkins voice. Wish they hadn't cut one of my favorite songs from the Broadway show and let him show off, but ""When the Sun Goes Down"" was absolute perfection. I was initially hesitant with some of the minor plot changes, probably mostly from expectations for it to be just like Broadway, but I'm the end it all worked well. Also wish most of Abuela's songs and parts hasn't been dropped. Olga was great on stage and was hoping she'd get to fully reprise it on screen.",nx3jdq

I got to see it with my mom, my brother, and my grandmother (who came to NYC from Cuba in the 40’s).  My grandma has since passed and it naturally infused this movie with some heavier feelings.  Also, growing up in El Barrio, this movie just nailed NYC.",nx3jdq

I like how they changed some of the plot points but still kept the core story. The choreography was phenomenal as were the songs (of course). Carnvale Del Barrio was probably one of my favorite musical numbers in a long time. Paciencia y fe absolute broke me in the best way possible. 

Shoutout to Anthony Ramos and Olga Merediz for their incredible performances. Olga seamlessly got back into her role while Anthony made it his own.

h1zelux,"As a longtime fan of the musical I highly enjoyed this fun summer movie.

My only notes:

* Removing the racist undertones of the Benny and Nina's father relationship was a miss

* The scene with the mover was weird.  He's calling her ma'am politely, a formal way to talk to a woman.  She says ""call me Señorita!""  I'm just trying to think of this in reverse where a Hispanic person was calling someone Señorita (which is fine and I'd actually like that), and someone says ""Call me Ma'am!"" - I think they would be looked down at as maybe prejudice.  I guess it's just the double standard that's bothering me there.",nx3jdq
h27yh4v,"Disclosure: I’m white and middle aged, and I’m ok that I’m not this movie’s target audience. TBH, for at least a decade I have felt routinely disappointed by movies, so I rarely go. I took my 12 year old daughter (who does musical theater)  to see ITH, though, and was fully in the mood to love it because we were enjoying a night of hanging out. She fell asleep twice, got up to wander around twice, and asked me repeatedly how much longer til the end. I’m still trying to process our meh response, b/c I want to understand why (!) We both agreed Benny was our favorite (amazing voice and very charismatic) and Abuela’s last song was genuinely powerful. But Usnavi, despite being a good hearted guy and easy on the eyes, danced very little, had little strife/conflict (other than a blackout) to contend with, and just didn’t seem like he was given a leading man’s job.  Making Daniela and Carla a couple pretty much rendered Cuca obsolete (and discarded the chemistry of the trio) but she inexplicably hung around anyway. I was irritated with that change especially bc it is so clearly about formulaic box checking (points for greater inclusivity!) but the exchange makes no sense. Last gripe: Miranda’s piragua man performance was really underwhelming. I read that the director encouraged him to take that role so that the part wouldn’t get cut, but he seemed like an outsider to the movie’s community somehow. Ok thank you for letting me get that off my chest. It is a generally positive movie about community love and that is good. 👍",nx3jdq

h1h487t,What a joy to watch. I already want to see it again.,nx3jdq
h1hd9q2,"Great movie, and it felt long, but man the songs they cut were tough to cut.

Just give us a damn intermission!  We can handle it!",nx3jdq
h1hyvlc,"I wanted to hate it, but it won me over by the end. I enjoyed Hamilton and Moana, so I knew the songs would get under my skin. I found a lot of it depressing (particularly with everyone struggling to make ends meet), and Abuela suddenly dying during the blackout -- although it was the emotional center of the movie -- felt like manipulative storytelling. The idea that at the end, Usnavi doesn't actually pursue his dreams of moving to the Dominican Republic, also seems kind of disappointing. Although I guess anyone would have stayed for someone like Vanessa. *\*sigh\**

Some of those sequences were amazing, though. Wish I had seen it in the movie theater, but it was easier to ~~pirate it~~ watch it on HBO Max. I have a bad habit of crying at every musical I see, so I didn't want to put myself through that in a public space again.",nx3jdq
h1j4wry,"Even though they cut some of the songs, it was nice to hear them in instrumental form during the movie. I think I heard Sunrise (when Usnavi was talking to Alejandro the lawyer in the beginning, and at other points in the film), Inútil (when Usnavi found the thrown-away lease application), Atención (I forget which part) and Everything I Know (when they were going thru Abuela's stuff)",nx3jdq

h1edu0o,"This film was an explosion of life and love that rocked me to my very soul and the songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda were amazing as the whole story was simply a jubilant celebration of dreams, family, community and what it means to belong.

The dazzling direction and wonderful cinematography of *In the Heights* transports the viewer into a musical wonderland that not only brings the fabric of the city to life it's also a heartfelt glimpse into a world that explores and reflects on the immigrant experience. This is the feel-good movie of the summer.",nx3jdq
hmgtcmh,Fricking loved it,nx3jdq
h2cs3ml,"Similar to Hamilton, In The Heights didn’t suck me in as much as I hoped it would as a Musical. On the upside, it’s easier to sit through despite the fairly lengthy runtime. There are some good choices of shots and set pieces to tie the music into, but other times it’s just characters singing in a bit of a bland and uninteresting way. The plot meanders somewhat and alot of characters to juggle around here too.

In the end, there’s just enough in there to hold my interest all the way without getting too bored. That being said, there’s not really any song I could say I remember or would want to listen to, but there’s nothing really that annoyed me too much either. Just another film that got way too much hype, and one that didn’t live up to expectations for me. At best it’s a mediocre Musical, at worst it doesn’t stay with you all that much. 4.5/10",nx3jdq
h1co6v0,"So I really love musicals and I love THIS musical in particular. Although I love musicals, movie musicals can be iffy. I will admit, I was excited but also nervous about In The Heights becoming a movie-musical. But: I really loved it. 

There were some changes from the original, but they weren't anything that made me too mad (Sorry ""Amanecer"" fans!) 

I think Chu did a good job transferring the theatricality into cinema. HUGE numbers, bright colors, a smooch of magical realism. 


Me encantó!",nx3jdq
h1h06q0,"I grew up in the south Bronx just across the bridge from Washington Heights, so I would constantly take the bus to and from there. And being a first gen Dominican-American, there were moments when this movie had me straight up bawling. Made me think about the sacrifices my parents made coming to this country. All the characters reminded me of my friends and neighbors in my hood. And I loved how they actually filmed in the Heights, sometimes I couldn’t tell who was an extra in the film and who was just a regular resident going about their day. And the music had me straight up dancing at times. 

I loved the positive representation of not just the Dom-Am and Latin-American community, but of Uptown NYC in general. It’s not just gangs, violence, crime and graffiti. There’s always been vibrant, hard working, close knit communities up here. Kudos to Lin Manuel Miranda and Jon Chu.  Ya knocked it out the park. And kudos to Anthony Ramos, Corey Hawkins, and the rest of the cast. They did a phenomenal job.",nx3jdq
h1okhsz,"I went into this movie only knowing that it was a musical set in New York City. I really enjoyed the setting, the music, the visuals, and the very talented cast. I spent most of the time rooting for Benny and Nina and loving Jimmy Smits. Overall, it was fun and impressive to watch. 

In terms of complaints, I wish I felt more invested in the plot's major challenges. For example, the blackout was set up as an impending disaster with a countdown clock, but when it hit, there wasn't any real panic or repercussions (or any explicit links to the larger themes of inequality, etc.). There was one casualty, but it happened so quickly that the timing made it seem coincidental -- everyone else was doing fine in the heat, and in fact, they were literally having fun together in the next room! As for Nina's backstory, after reading the comments here, I wish they'd kept in some of the original details to make her struggle more explicit and understandable.

Overall, I thought it was a fun watch, and I imagine it would be even more fun if for those who have seen the original musical and can fill in some of the gaps.",nx3jdq

I had high expectations and this somehow still met them - it blended the catchy songs with great visuals and wonderful set pieces, and the twists in the story actually caught me off guard a few times - the way the final act came together alongside the reveal of where the beach scenes actually were had me tearing up. Also, the dance scene between Bennie and Nina on the side of the building was beautiful and I'm probably gonna be watching it a few more times over the next few weeks.

Also great to see in theaters if possible, especially with Dolby. 

I hadn't seen any other versions of the show, so I didn't have any expectations, but my friend was a bit disappointed that they cut a couple songs and changed some characters/plot points. But she also enjoyed some of the things they added, so overall she had a very positive reaction.",nx3jdq

h1ec75l,"For anyone on the fence, I really recommend giving it a shot. It's a great feel good movie that we all need after the last few years.

As someone who was obsessed with ITH musical, seen a local version, and devoured the OBCR, it was a bit of a struggle to get over the changes but I really enjoyed the film. I agree with some weak points about the Rosario storyline cuts (taking some of my favourite songs with them), but Olga Merediz brought it (as always) to Abuela Claudia and ""Pacienca y Fe"". ""Breathe"" had me in tears, it's always been the song that hits hardest for me. Anthony Ramos and Corey Hawkins did great in their roles. I think Jon Chu did a good job bringing enough of the musical into the film world and considering the runtime is still nearly 2.5hrs I can see why they needed to cut things. Vanessa's 'Devil Wears Prada' detour was a bit odd but I think it was trying to flesh out her character more than just Usnavi thinks she's cute.",nx3jdq
h1ihzha,"It isn't a perfect film or adaptation, but goddamn I loved that this was proud of being a musical. 

So many filmed adaptations of musicals run away from the fact that they are musicals (especially Les Mis and Sweeney Todd). 

In the Heights was proud of what it was and that's why this is going to be a musical classic. It didn't hide from musicality and theatricality, it embraces it. 

I have some minor quibbles but on the whole a wonderful adaptation with some absolutely stunning sequences (especially the dance on the building and the run of songs from 96,000 through the end of the Claudia sequence)",nx3jdq

And in the end, I think Hamilton benefitted from a strong main character and story, whereas In The Heights really suffered from the lack of both. The songs were utterly forgettable, even if they were lyrically interesting. There wasn't a single song I was humming afterwards or even cared to play again. Choreography was excellent (you could see the Step Up influence, especially in the pool). Overall I would give it a 5.5.

h1k9ism,"As a first-generation New York City Latina, In The Heights hits incredibly close to home. I’ve been a fan of the Broadway musical for over a decade so I was elated to finally see it on the big screen though I didn’t exactly love how it was adapted. Overall, I would recommend buying a movie ticket if only for la cultura/supporting more Latino stories coming to the big screen. 7/10 stars. A few critiques and praises:

- I’m really surprised they let Hudes write the screenplay considering her book (for the stage) was previously criticized. I think both suffer from a lack of focus— especially hated the changes to the lotto/Abuela Claudia storyline and how convoluted Nina’s “dropping out” was. Some of the script could’ve been tightened and run time reduced.
- Hawkins, Barrera, and Smits were especially standout in their performances but I was really disappointed by Leslie Grace. Her voice was weak (last note in “Breathe” was BAD and where did that beautiful ending harmony in “When You’re Home” go?) Her dancing was also stiff.
- Some of the changes to the music, especially the endings of “Blackout” and “Paciencia y Fe”, were disappointing. The songs felt incomplete to me. That being said, I thought everything else in “Paciencia y Fe” was near perfect and so creatively executed, especially the choreography. I also loved the opening number, “No Me Diga”, and “The Club.”
- Lighting/editing in “96,000” was atrocious. I understand the rain situation that day but the artificial lighting in some of those scenes looked so bad. Also, Sonny’s hair being wet then dry in his solo was cringe and I wish the final frame of his rap didn’t include the dancers... why do I feel like they always try to diminish the seriousness of what he’s saying? “You are so cute!” is enough of a softener.
- A minor complaint: for a PG-13 movie there was a lot of cheesy kid-centric moments which I could’ve done without.
- In general, the movie felt very authentic which is arguably the most important part. From the food to the fashion to the music and the movement... In The Heights felt like home and a loving representation of my people and our stories.",nx3jdq
h1e1cuj,"Musical are by far my least favourite film genre but I enjoyed this quite a bit. Really solid technical execution, charming performances, catchy songs.

Like we're the characters meant to be in poverty? Because they seemed to be somewhere bizarrely in between being middle class to being poor and it seemed odd to me.

As well as that there seemed to be a lot of spainieh dialogue without subtitles. I think I got most of what was said by context but it still was kinda jarring to have no idea what was being said, especially when other lines were subtitled. 

Some other small bits seemed to only work if you were aware of the American system. Like the green card thing went over my head until later on in the film where Nina asks Sonny about it.

h1d7d8r,"The bad: Missed my favorite songs, Sunrise and Everything I Know. Vanessa’s actress played it fairly bitchy and blank instead of tough/sweet/cool than Olivo had nailed in the Broadway original. 

The good: literally everything else. Usnavi, Benny, and Abuela were standouts for me and just pure oozy charisma. Pacienca y Fe, that subway scene, will maybe be in my head for the rest of my life. Being Cuban I could smell the ropa vieja from her stove and my heart was bursting with how well they captured so much of the joy, energy, struggle, love of it all.",nx3jdq
h1czobn,10/10. A perfect movie. INCREDIBLE! No complaints here. This is exactly what a movie should be.,nx3jdq
h1d670b,"I've been a big fan of this musical for years now. I've seen lots of comments here and there about how they're disappointed that Sunrise/Inutil was cut but I for one loved every change they did here. They did well to flesh out the characters more here, and got rid of unnecessary conflicts that didn't really serve any big purpose. (Benny/Nina fight in the club)



Overall, I felt like this was a solid 9 out of 10. It's not the best movie I've seen, but it's almost flawless imo. I think this is the best adaptation of a Broadway musical I've ever seen. At the least, it's the most aesthetically pleasing I've ever seen. The sound design was amazing as well, they did amazing with how they incorporated everyday sounds to their audio. Did it better than Baby Driver imo.",nx3jdq

h1i2636,"This was SOOO GOOD!!! I went in with sky-high expectations and exited completely satisfied, favorite movie of the year so far.

I was slightly worried at the beginning because the first number ""In The Heights"" didn't really catch me... but Nina's ""Breathe"" really took my breath away, and after that I was fucking IN.

Haven't seen the stage musical before, but even I can tell this was so well adapted. The direction in particular really blew me away, there were so many cool ""reflection"" shots through mirror or glass, fun animated flairs, and interesting camera choices. Pool scene is of course great, but my favorite sequence was Benny and Nina singing through the park. It was such a perfect encapsulation of all the movement and LIFE that happens in the background of an urban environment. The whole movie was just bursting with creativity and earnestness.",nx3jdq

I hope whoever wrote these songs cuts a hefty check to the guy wrote Hamilton.",nx3jdq
h1cqki0,"The movie is so vibrant and energetic, seeing it on the big screen was a treat. The choreography is fantastic and Jon Chu really knows how to film the dance numbers. He then elevates them with creative visuals. The cast knocked it out of the park and did justice to Miranda's songs. The two couples are charismatic and very attractive, and then you have great supporting characters like the abuela. Also, Jimmy Smits in a musical! I was moved several times and will definitely be watching again. Btw there is a post-credits scene with a reprise.",nx3jdq
h1j2nll,"I'm not much of a musical fan, but this really was a fantastic movie. Heartfelt with some great music, choreography, and technical prowess. One of the first musicals for me where I actually went and listened to the soundtrack afterwards.

My only complaint is that I feel it drags on just a tad, there were a few less exciting sequences that I felt could've been cut to make it a tighter experience, but from what I understand musicals tend to be pretty lengthy, so I won't dock it any points for that.

All in all a very joyous feel-good summer movie with great music and some great laughs.",nx3jdq
h1on0x3,[deleted],nx3jdq
h1hixx7,"I think this is a hard movie to rate because its message is pretty different from the play. The play's message is more of a ""family is where you find it"" kind of thing, while the film is more ""don't give up on your dreams"" thing.

Because of that, I think where the film falters is in the 2nd act, mostly because of changing the lotto ticket plotline to the end of the film changed the entire arc of the entire musical's story (in the play, we find out pretty early in act 1, and that knowledge influences a lot of character decisions going into the second act). It also makes the pacing of the film a bit weird in the 2nd act, plus make some of the songs in the film seem out of place in the narrative.

Like ""96,000"" could have been cut since the lotto story has no real bearing on the story until the final five minutes. And having ""Carnaval del Barrio"" where it was in the film was just weird. In the film, it feels more like a tacked on song that slows the film down because the point of the song was changed in the film. In the play, it happens during the blackout and ends with Abuela Claudia's death, which in turn leads to ""Atencion"" and ""Alabanza"".

Changing the lotto story also removed Abuela Claudia from the story for long stretches of time,  and with the cutting of Nina's story, make her impact on the community seem less tangible. So her death, while sad, doesn't hit as hard as it could have. Similarly, it was a shame to see Nina (arguably the show's co-lead) reduced to a supporting character. Her storyline with Benny is so great in the stage play, especially the conflict between her father and Benny.

That said, taken on its own, it's a good movie musical. But it's a mediocre adaptation of the stage play.

I'd say on its own, the film is an 8.5/10. As an adaptation, a 6/10.

Also, give Olga Merediz an oscar nomination for best supporting actress now. She's that good.",nx3jdq
h1iaufb,"Absolutely adored it.  Huge fan of the Broadway show and the cutting of the song "" inutil"" bugged me but sort of saw it wasn't really needed in this version.  
Anthony Ramos killed it.

h1d672k,"I was about to give this movie a 0/10 when they passed by the place where the Piragua reprise is supposed to happen and I realized it wasn’t gonna happen. I was like “they’re gonna tease us a Lin Manuel and Chris Jackson rivalry and then NOT capitalize on it with the funniest moment in the whole musical??”

Then the after credits scene happened. 10/10.

Then Chris looks at his piragua and makes a facial expression like “wait, did he poison this?” 11/10.",nx3jdq
h1d67zk,"I was kind of disappointed.  Maybe I got my hopes up too high after seeing Hamilton, but this didn't really do it for me.  Maybe this is another case of film adaptations of musicals just not being very good.  Maybe the musical was never for me in the first place.  Maybe after watching Hamilton and Hadestown (on Youtube), I tricked myself into thinking I might actually like musicals, when that's still not the case.

Speaking of Hadestown, it was cool seeing a cameo by Patrick Page.  Wish he would have had something to sing, lol.",nx3jdq
h1kjpj2,"I'll be honest, aside from the beginning and end, and the broadening of Vanessa's story, I found a lot of the changes made kinda cringey and the whole middle to end was tedious to downright exhausting. I didn't really like Crazy Rich Asians, it was just too cheesy, and this skirts dangerously close to that as well. So maybe Jon Chu is not my kinda filmmaker. There's also a few editing decisions that irked me, especially during Black Out when certain lines in the song hit, and their on what is essentially an unimportant B-Roll shot. The song just started to feel tacked on.

Other then that, the moments they get right are quite good. That pool sequence is top notch for instance. If a film adaptation is ever made of Hamilton I hope Jon Chu is not involved though.

h1d08w9,I’m Puerto Rican so I’ll support anything with good Latin representation. I really liked this but the characters kind of felt hollow to me.

How do you guys feel about it? I've noticed this with other songs as well... Maybe I just need a rewatch to get used to it.

h1o0rty,"Just got out of the theatre. Had 0 prior knowledge of what the film was about beyond being a musical set in NYC and thats what I got. 

This is a movie that should be casually playing on your TV set during the summer, but it's more of something to look at from time to time than a real focused film imo. It has no overarching plot which made keeping my interest up a struggle especially after the Blackout the movie seemed to just drag out to the ending. 

But the film is beautiful, sets and cinematography were wonderful, songs were decent, and dance choreography was superb. It's a very pretty film at the least.",nx3jdq
h1o6kf3,"This was made for fans of the theatrical version/theater. As someone who has never seen the play and thinks movies should stand on their own, it dropped the ball hard.

Finished: very mediocre movie, not sure what all this hype is about. Characters were barey developed, their storylines were all barebones too. My eyes rolled to the back of my head when Vanessa picked up the rag at the end and acted like she invented tie-dye. Songs weren’t that memorable either. I’d go with 2 stars.",nx3jdq

h1ne7wl,"I enjoyed it overall. There’s a lot to love, but like any film, it doesn’t get some things right. Ramos did amazing as Usnavi and had a lot of charm which I enjoyed. Felt kind of disconnected to Vanessa’s character….But I wanted more Benny and Nina!!! I feel like I was rooting for them more than the main love story. Hawkins and Grace did great with what they were given but their chemistry was amazing and I fell in love with them. 

I have to say, the length took me out at times, but I would have loved to see the leads be played by black actors. I mean, that’s what you really see in The Heights for the most part! No one looks like Vanessa out there lol, very rarely. Beautiful and talented, but did not really connect to her portrayal of the character.",nx3jdq
h1kde82,"This one left me cold. It's not terrible, but I was just apathetic the whole time. Maybe I'm just being unfair because I re-watched West Side Story earlier this year, which is bursting with imagination and creative choreography. 

I do think the main cast was really good. Usnavi really has a charm and I look forward to seeing more from this actor. His young cousin was also good and his storyline was the most powerful in my opinion. Vanessa was fine. Nina was good, even if her stories about Stanford life seemed really forced.

I didn't find the direction that imaginative. There just weren't that many great shots. The dancing on the side of the building was probably the most memorable, followed by the pool scene.

I say give it a watch if you're subscribed to HBO and you like musicals. Just don't expect an instant classic.",nx3jdq

h1kys47,"I am confused about the die hard hype about it.

The music is solid, not something I would listen or or enjoy (Where as I enjoy a lot of Sondheim) but I respect LMM’s artistry beyond.  Alot of passion and hard work.

There were points I wished I could have seen it on stage since it seems like a very creative musical to come up.  However the movie itself felt a bit boring? All the characters felt hollow except Vanessa & Jimmy Smits.  Nina seemed like a brat, ugh racisim, let me drop out of school (just an fyi I am a poc and dealt with a lot of racism as many others have) when her dad is doing his best to give her a bright future and then right after the fight they all go dancing? Meh.

Usnavi seemed pretty bland as well, just a good ol nice guy.  No stakes and no conflict.  Same with young Dr Dre, no stakes or conflict (but super talented) 

Lastly, you have multiple characters but your dumb ending is singing on the street and that was he was talking go his kid in a bodega? So that’s about a 10 year jump, did the kid get his greencard? Did Nina and young Dr Dre stay a couple? Did she become a lawyer? Where is Jimmy Smits? Smh

To sum it up, amazing and respect that LMM made this project but narratively and as a film it felt hollow, no stakes and too happy? Even the grandma’s death I felt nothing.  Idk maybe I am a negative person tried to be open minded here",nx3jdq

The .5 taken off was due to it feeling a bit too long. I know they cut some of the music from the original play, but without an intermission or some better pacing, it still felt a bit long. Regardless, this is absolutely fantastic and if you hate it, you probably have bad taste.",nx3jdq
h1kx8o2,[deleted],nx3jdq
h1dl6q2,"I can’t put into words just how happy I am to have seen this movie. Pretty sure I looked like a kid in a candy store the entire time I was watching!

Overall I’d rate this movie 8.5 or 9/10. A lot of differences from the Broadway version, but the themes and spirit of it are retained throughout the movie. I can’t help but feel as though Benny and Nina’s story was watered down, especially with “Sunrise” and “Everything I Know” being absent. Thank god they kept “When You’re Home” though, Nina’s line: “When I was younger I'd imagine what would happen if my parents had stayed in Puerto Rico” will never fail to resonate with me.

Benny and Nina aside, I really can’t think of anything else that bothers me. The ending, while different still maintains the Broadway ending’s poignant potency. “Blackout” feels a little underwhelming, when compared to the Broadway version. But it is instantly buoyed by “Paciencia y Fe” and Olga’s incredible performance.

Oh, and the camerawork! So satisfying throughout the film!

And John Chu did a great job using the medium of film to enhance the dance numbers or to try and emulate a stage performance in a movie.

Musical numbers were fantastic, 10/10. The issue is when the music stopped as the non-music and dialogue scenes were both way too long and not nearly gripping enough. Reading through other comments I can see many plots were cut from the film and it shows. 

Abuela Claudia was not central enough to the whole community to make her character work, and the lotto revel made no sense where it was put in the film. Vanessa's character made zero sense, and they probably should have just left her as a barrio girl looking to escape the neighborhood rather than tacking on the designer plot line. The Dreamer reveal felt very loosely added with little exploration or follow through considering the heft of the subject matter. Most all of Usnavi's central conflict did not really work for me as it was clearly obvious throughout the film how little sense it made to leave literally everyone he knew to go back to the DR. I get what the film was trying to do, obviously, but it never felt like a serious difficult decision.

Lin-Manuel Miranda’s innovative first musical bursts off the screen abuzz with the vibrancy, energy, and urgency of New York City itself! A joyous celebration of family, of culture, and the dreams both big and small that make us who we are the film is a love letter to movie musicals (flashes of West Side Story, glimpses of Rent, even a spritz of Hairspray with a sprinkle of Baz Luhrman’s magical realism) that pays homage to many but never feels like it’s trying too hard. It finds a way to feel familiar but brings a new flavor to the genre, succeeding on nearly every level. Well cast and even better sung, eye-catching visuals to spare, and wearing its heart on its delicately detailed sleeve the film is an authentically emotional, deeply human experience.

I had a ton of fun watching this. Really enjoyed the story, great dance and music sequences, great performances and a great balance of drama and humor.

Saw this on IMAX and will definitely rewatch in theaters or on HBO Max.

Favorite movie of the year so far!",nx3jdq

h2dr468,Maybe it's because i'm not into musicals that much but damn they just did not stop singing. I thought the rule is that there's supposed to be dialogue and then when the emotions get so high thats when u break into song. they just sang the entire time. all the songs blended together. idk,nx3jdq
h1gf6w6,"I just saw half an hour. Question, does it gets better? Until now is videoclippy and kind of Disney diversity woka trashy. Doesn't feel like a movie, but a theater musical filmed in the hood with carousel music. 

It is not West Side Story.

I'm from Latin America, but I'm not an ""American Latino"", these people from certain Caribbean Islands and Mexico show in the movie.",nx3jdq

How does it compare?",nx3jdq
h1ggd9a,Cast wise: There was no one that really had a bad performance ( specifically Corey Hawkins as Benny is amazing) but I know from the musical to film it seemed that they kinda moved Usnavi and Vanessa to the two leads and Nina and Benny got moved into supportive members because apart of their duets which I love they didn't really get any other dialogue.,nx3jdq

h1lzf7m,"I mean, I could be wrong, but it didn't seem like a technically difficult scene to film. Aside from the gravity flipping transitions, that entire dancing on the wall section appeared to just be them on flat ground, using a partial set modeled as the side of the building, with a whole lot of keyed in background for most of the environment. 

Like, honestly, a lot of that scene was probably just on a nice straight dolly track, keeping level and the same distance from the actors for the entire shot. 

Not saying it wasn't effective, because it was. I just personally wouldn't say it was ""incredible filming technique"", going off of how I'm assuming it was filmed.",nx3jdq

h1ijq4r,"The sweeping, beautiful shots that he creates are really great in this context. I liked Crazy Rich Asians, but there was a pretty stark divide there because it was understood that we're dealing with the super wealthy elite of Asia. There's a different set of expectations and to an extent it's not exactly great to see the fullest extent of how opulent rich people are when they just had the privilege of being born into generational wealth. Compare that to In The Heights, where the direction manages to make a neighborhood block feel like an entire city, and a beautiful one with character.",nx3jdq
h1d0g97,"That little girl looked so much like Anthony Ramos, by the end of the movie, I convinced myself that they must be related in real life.

Man, hats off to the casting director.",nx3jdq
h1l4r03,"The first shot of the crab definitely grabbed my attention. It looked so unnaturally vibrant and all I could think about was if there were actually crabs like that in real life.

I was suspicious of the beach bar the whole time because I’ve seen the stage version and him actually going back to DR is antithetical to the original ending. So when we first see Pete’s mural it made me go “Ohhh…” and then the line about the crab confirmed it before being officially revealed.",nx3jdq

h1k74x3,I've been obsessed with the show since it originally aired. Seeing it in Broadway as a kid was what made me fall in love with theatre. I wanted to see it Thursday so bad but waited til today to see it in theatre. It was AMAZING. You gotta try and see it in theatres.,nx3jdq

I discovered In the Heights (specifically a cover of Breathe) when I was coming to terms with having to quit college due to an extreme lack of funds, so it stung a bit to have a fair portion of her arc changed (all of the beats are still there and she's angry at her dad for selling half of the building, but she's cool with it the second time?).",nx3jdq

h71anqk,I wonder if that bodega is getting more visits than usual.,nx3jdq
h1ijuk8,It was really interesting when they were making it- we actually get a lot of films shooting up here because it's cheaper/easier to get permits and the neighborhood can double as downtown pretty easily. This was the first one I've seen where you could feel the pride and excitement in the neighborhood instead of just annoyance and inconvenience. It was a thrill that we were actually going to be *Washington Heights* in a movie instead of '173rd Street Pretending To Be The UWS'. The love for the neighborhood that went into filming this is definitely apparent on the screen and it feels so amazing watching it.,nx3jdq
h1d8vcw,"> Oh, and ""Paciencia y Fe"" hits like a truck, even moreso than it does on stage. An entire song about her working her ASS OFF her entire life, never taking the easy way out, only to end with her choosing the stairs instead of the ramp -still not taking the easy way - as she passes. Oof.

That song hits so hard because it’s so clear-eyed. It’s about a woman who took a huge chance and uprooted herself…and built an admirable life she lived with pride and joy. The polished up version of that story that I hear is all about achieving “great things,” whatever that means. 

It was so refreshing to see a version that wasn’t about incredible achievements but also wasn’t glorifying some absurd self-sacrificing ideal of poverty…just someone who strived to a normal degree doing something inherently worthwhile (if thankless), lived comfortably and joyfully, and died on her own terms.",nx3jdq
h1defnu,"As someone who has climbed that ramp, it ain't that easy lmao",nx3jdq
h1luez3,"As I think about that shot of the stairs, I think about my mother and my abuela. Both came here with similar circumstances as Abuela and the humility she showed of taking whatever job she had and just trying to have a chance to live to the very end where she kept that humility by taking the stairs was so beautifully acted and shot. In my life and work, I find that immigrants are often the hardest working and most humble folks you will ever meet and we as a nation should be so lucky to have them. Please support any local and nationwide program they supports immigrants, as Lin-Manuel Miranda said in a different play “Immigrants, we get the job done”.",nx3jdq
h231zn9,"Finally saw it last night and strongly agree with your point on 96,000. 

The ability to have such a massive ensemble number vs what you’d get on a stage performance adds a ton of value. It shows the depth of how important the lottery is to the so many people. How everyone has their sueñitos that they can hold out hope for.",nx3jdq
h1ho2d2,I’ve been to many plays but I’ve never felt the heightened tension or emotionality. I think for me the score in a film really helps boost those emotions. Films like Lion have had a huge emotional impact on me as an example.,nx3jdq

h1lhekg,"I wonder why they killed off Camila 🤔 I don’t think it added or detracted to the story, so it’s sorta an interesting choice. 

I also was so mad that I thought they removed the lottery win. I actually spoiled it to my fiancé, thinking they cut the plot line after Usnavi says “No one turned in the ticket.” And then the actual reveal was so much more impactful, I wish I hadn’t ruined it for my fiancé.",nx3jdq
h1dbgye,"Nina's mom being dead made no sense imo, she kept the dad in check and she had one of my favorite songs that got cut.",nx3jdq

And tuition isn't crazy at all. Nothing a loan couldn't pay for. No need to sell the business. Kind of took me out of it. Hate the can't afford college trope.

To add I also hate that trope that minorities often feel they don't belong or are betraying their heritage by going to college. It's condescending. As if we're ill prepared for the ""real"" world.",nx3jdq
h1l060p,"I totally agree. I never saw the stage show, but I listened to the soundtrack a lot, and that was just meh. But it's one of the highlights of the film.",nx3jdq
h2i7fl8,"I actually think that, in the original, PyF  is one of the more effective and well-crafted numbers in the play. After $96k, Claudia has a chat with Usnavi and is like ""aight, imma take a walk, peace."" And then, for (seemingly) no reason, she starts to have this big existential crisis in song. The song builds and builds and builds, and then right at the apex, it breaks down, and she finally reveals what's been bothering her the whole time: she won the lottery. 

That moment, that ""what do I do with this winning ticket?"" provides an answer to multiple questions. It explicitly answers the question of the preceding song, ""who won the lottery?"" But it also answers the question ""what the hell is this song and why is Claudia singing it?"" And it *also* sets up the Checkov's gun that will be a major plot driver for the second act. So there's mounting energy both within the song and in the preceding song that builds up to this one pivotal moment. And that's just good theatre!

So idk, the way this song plays with time I always thought was super effective. This is one of the few songs in the musical that really feels at the level of some of the best solo numbers in Hamilton, like ""Satisfied"" and ""Wait for It.""",nx3jdq
h1dq2xe,"I think in hindsight it should've been obvious but I didn't see the reveal coming. I forgot that Abuela had bought a ticket at the start of the movie so I assumed Usnavi or someone else might see it on the ground later on but then I forgot about it. When he opens her little trinket box at the end of the movie and I saw the slip of paper underneath her things I realised what happened.

It was a very satisfying reveal for me that I genuinely wasn't expecting. It made me tear up a bit.",nx3jdq
h1f0fft,"I found the reveal for the ticket really touching, although I was a little confused on why abuela never cashed it in. 

When Usnavi told the kids that he never found out who won the ticket i took that to be the end of it, where the lottery story was just a little lesson on hope or something. totally put it off my mind after that

The moment they showed a little box on the windowsill though i was like oH OHHHHHHH",nx3jdq

h1f6wdm,"As a first time viewer, I thought it was a mixed bag. My initial guess was that she won, but when Usnavi told the kids that they never found out I took it at face value (and thought it was a weird choice to have a huge song about lottery winnings that nobody would get). But then when Usnavi picks up the box at the end I was pretty sure the winning ticket would be in there. So I guess it didn't really surprise me, but the emotional beats of it did land.",nx3jdq
h1ha8cz,I didn’t realize until he opened the little box and saw some paper and then I started crying AGAIN. I have no frame of reference from the musical but I loved how it happened,nx3jdq

It worked well for me. I had forgotten that Abuela had even bought a ticket by that point.",nx3jdq

h1rl2yn,"It surprised me, but I do think the stage version sounds better...it felt a bit contrived.

Also, how did the frame narrative work in the show? I didn't really like it here, and I'm wondering if it was an addition for the movie.",nx3jdq
h1lqtgx,"As soon as the winner wasn’t there in 96,000 I knew that the abuela had won. It was basically her or Mr. Rosario, and she makes more sense as she’d be the one to give it away to her neighborhood children. Interesting that it is revealed a lot earlier originally though",nx3jdq
h1o4uzz,"I was kind of confused by Abuela's decision to give the money to Usnavi. Like that money could have paid for Nina's education (or at least a good portion of it), Mr. Rosario wouldn't have to sell his business and Benny would still have a job. 

Maybe Abuela was just closer to Usnavi or she didn't feel that Nina was passionate about college to justify paying for tuition. But since she was given no chance to explain her decision I was left feeling a bit lost.",nx3jdq
h2g4yyg,"Honestly as soon as Usnavi said he had sold a winning ticket, I assumed (correctly) who had bought it so it wasn't a surprise to me. I was surprised that they waited so long to reveal it but I feel like that made the reveal of her leaving it for Usnavi even more moving because he couldn't even thank her in person.",nx3jdq
h2cdh13,"I kinda guessed it was her or Benny after the lottery song because they were the only two characters I noticed who bought tickets but weren't present for the song. I totally forgot about it as the movie went on though. Took me a moment to realise it was that ticket as well when he found it.

Overall it felt grand and a neat twist. One thing If say against it is that it felt confusing to me why she hadn't brought it up? But I think she died literally the next day so it's possible she just didn't get the chance.",nx3jdq
h2hl2td,"I thought it was Nina’s father—I definitely did not know who it was. It worked, but I was left wondering when Abuela wrote it down, and what if Usnavy never found it? When was she going to tell him? It worked but felt a  little like an afterthought.",nx3jdq

h1pemkh,Sunrise is one of my favourite songs from any musical ever and when i heard they cut it i was heartbroken. having it as a melody in the background felt like salt in the wound.,nx3jdq
h1pseqh,"My biggest issue with the writing of the adaptation is the Benny/Nina arc. I'm a big Benny fan, but regardless I think they made several weird unnecessary decisions. 

Their whole relationship is a ""friends suddenly seeing each other as more"" trope. So to have a couple throw away lines telling us they dated in high school just makes ALL of that really weird. The dispatch woman saying ""The boss's daughter!"" in quiet shock (dumbest line in the whole movie), the whole ""I hear you've been talking to Benny"" verse of No Me Diga, and generally everything else about their relationship no longer really makes sense. Also the throw away lines don't even make sense in context imo. And idk what that change was even for, it doesn't help with any of the other changes?

Then the cut of my favorite song Sunrise, and THEN the insane time jump at When the Sun Goes Down where it says ""one month later"" and then Benny *immediately* goes ""let's pretend it's exactly a month ago before the title card came up."" Just in general I thought they both did great but pretty every one of the very few things that this adaption does wrong in my opinion all revolve around Benny and Nina.",nx3jdq
h1d6yap,"Okay, but for real tho, I live in Texas and the blackout scene brought on a little PTSD. It never occurred to me that we could have a freaking summer blackout and I am now looking at portable fans.",nx3jdq
h1gsssn,No jokes about this please. People actually died during the winter storm from the blackouts themselves.,nx3jdq
h2plsj1,"I kind of felt like that was intentional - nobody had a particularly *bad* ending out of those you’ve listed, their lives just didn’t seem to improve. They were surviving and attempting to thrive. 

In the Heights focuses on the struggles of minority groups and I feel like ending it where everyone got a dream ending would detract from that because at the end of the day, they’re never gonna get a dream ending unless things fundamentally change. They can only get ‘close enough’.",nx3jdq
h3lp7iq,"Washington Heights may not be a trendy neighborhood, but is far from being a shithole you need to ""escape"" from. Most of the neighborhood is middle class. I think the movie gives the impression that the nighborhood is way poorer than it actually is.

hif6mdc,"Usnavi spoils the end. ""Some are happy ending, some are bittersweet.""

And that's the latino experience for us. Our sucesses are not forever. We pave the way for the ones that will come next. Nina's whole arc is that realization. Her dad and mom paved the way for her. Others paved the way for them. And now she must pave the way for Sonny. 

The struggle is eternal for a people that is always seem as cheap and disposable. I think the movie had a great end.",nx3jdq
h1ohdr4,"Nah, he killed it in Step-up 2. I remember nobody couldn’t stop talking about the water dance with [Moose](https://youtu.be/rnM8XsuKi0M) at the end of it, classic step-up. After that, I feel like he had some pretty feel good movies. I feel like the media is finally recognizing his name as a household name (honestly, me included). He has a certain style in his movies, I’m noticing though which is cool and unique.",nx3jdq
h1cv3yq,It still trips me out when I hear her normal voice vs her B99 voice.,nx3jdq

h1njb58,"Between her and Dascha Polanco, this movie has two of my top three celebrity crushes",nx3jdq
h1dplrt,I'm mad they covered up her eyelash scar,nx3jdq
h1dhfa1,Her voice sounded puny in comparison but so does everybody's. I really wish I could have seen Mandy as Angelica when she played the role with the Chicago cast of Hamilton.,nx3jdq
h1h6xon,Completely agree. Loved the movie but I’m very attached to the way Mandy sings Breathe. It doesn’t help that it’s probably the song I’ve related to most in my life so I’ve listened to it a lot. I was sad they cut Everything I Know but the original is all I really need.,nx3jdq
h2ntjbh,I’ve been like once a year ago. The snow cone thing was for sure accurate and I can confirm it was filmed there. The bodega also accurate for anywhere in NYC that isn’t lower Manhattan and like Williamsburg. Idk about the rest,nx3jdq

h1daqi7,"It’s not original music so I don’t think it’s eligible, but Olga will likely be on the radar for supporting.",nx3jdq
h1k2663,"That scene alone was a piece of art on its own. 

The warm lighting when she was singing about home versus blue/cold lighting for NY. The costumes reminiscent of the Santeria religion. Little details like the subway ads being mid century! My own abuela came from Cuba to NY in the 60’s, so naturally my mom and I were sobbing together when we watched it. 

Not having scene the show on stage, I really liked how they >!framed that number as a literal dream sequence where she decides whether she stays or moves on.!<

The choreography of the entire movie was so spot on. A detail I loved was that during Carnaval del barrio, when they were waving flags and repping specific countries, they were doing a traditional dance from each respective country. It was such a quick thing but so much love and thought was put into the whole film.",nx3jdq
h1gocnf,He was phenomenal.,nx3jdq

h37smyc,"I just LOVE his interactions with Vanessa. His Usnavi is so clueless, he just doesn't know how to be around her and he still shows us he really wants to be around her more and we can FEEL IT with Anthony's acting. I'm just in love, seriously.",nx3jdq
h1h63y8,I hope he gets an oscar nom. He really convinced me in his role,nx3jdq
h1h8myo,He was amazing,nx3jdq
h1jfa98,He’s kinda creepy looking. Super talented tho for sure,nx3jdq
h1eejqn,"i have no solid reasons why, but he bothers me for some reason and just seems fake. of course i don't know him so i have no true idea.",nx3jdq
h1d7hqd,Can we give a shahtaht to Marc fucking Anthony. He killed those few minutes he had on screen. Holy shit.,nx3jdq
h1d5aql,"Oh my god, thank you for explaining that. I'm an idiot and thought it was because he was too young.",nx3jdq
h1d6i9h,God as a huge fan of the musical I was not expecting any major plot twists going in but that got the biggest gasp out of me I think I’ve ever made towards a plot twist,nx3jdq
h1dsso6,That hit me hard. Barely recognized Marc Anthony in that scene.,nx3jdq
h1dh9wf,"I'm not Latino, but even I teared up with all the stuff happening at the end of the film just like you were.

Films like this (and many others as well of course) prove and showcase (and perhaps even remind) why representation matters.",nx3jdq
h1d7bqw,"I didn’t even connect that while watching it, wow",nx3jdq
h1m1w6h,"I mean, literally how else would you interpret that line",nx3jdq
h1pb8k0,"You’re right, there are some things in this film that just make sense if you’ve been around these types of characters in your life. Little details in this film that make us feel seen, ya know?",nx3jdq
h1p78pz,"What's also amazing is that in the original musical, ""Pacienca y Fe"" was like the 5th song in the entire musical. The context is so different in the movie and honestly has a stronger impact in the context of all the other character's struggling with their immigrant identity. I really liked that they placed it on her deathbed rather than in the beginning of the show (she also reveals she wins the lottery wayy earlier in the musical and Usnavi and her have a whole song talking about how they are going to use the money).",nx3jdq
h1pjkjh,Agree with your points about the differences. Just wanted to add that Piragua Reprise is in there as a post credits scene! I know LMM spoke about wanted to include a story about undocumented immigrants which is why they added the protest and Sonny's changes I guess.,nx3jdq
h1ppnff,"Absolutely agree! I was happy the Piragua reprise was added as post credits, but I have no clue why they wouldn't just put it in the movie itself. 

As a non-US citizen, I found the scene with Sonny's dad very confusing upon my first viewing. ""How do you pay him?/Cash/Why do you think that is?"" me: ehhhhhhhhh???? He's too young for a bank account? However, upon second viewing this became clear to me (why was the protest scene not before this one?) Maybe it was created like this though, not overexplaining the plot and expecting people to rewatch (as I only noticed the green crab at the start of the movie upon second viewing as well).

I also found it weird that Sonny says he was in pampers when he came to the states and implies he and Usnavi came together. However, Usnavi's name is still inspired by a US Navy ship. As there's an age gap between the two, I always assumed Sonny was born in the US in the original. But maybe my assumption that they came together is incorrect..",nx3jdq
h21ekfh,"I saw ITH on Broadway when it first came out in 2008 and when the blackout scene happened, I legitimately thought there was a blackout. The entire theatre was dark and the cast took out their phones to light the stage, it wasn't until they started singing that I realized it was part of the show. 

I remember turning to my sister and saying 'oh shit, what happened?'",nx3jdq
h1ebft7,"I can't remember when that line was but in the musical, intermission is right after ""Blackout"" / the fireworks. Act 2 begins with 3 cut songs and then ""Carnaval del Barrio"". The order of songs was shuffled around a bit though.",nx3jdq
h1h4mrv,"I don’t think the whole part with him narrating the story to the kids is even in the original musical at all. In the musical, Usnavi is just narrating to the audience",nx3jdq
h1oqqex,"In the show the intermission is between Blackout and Sunrise. Blackout was changed in the film - in the original there is conflict between Benny and Nina because he blames her for her dad selling the business. They shifted the argument lines in Blackout to Usnavi and Vanessa. In the original the climax of Blackout is Benny and Nina’s kiss during the fireworks at the end, resolving the tension of their argument. Then after the intermission, Sunrise (cut from the movie) is Benny and Nina’s duet after spending the night together. 

In general with the movie, they simplified the Benny/Nina relationship which made Usnavi the clear cut main character (along with adding the narrative of him telling the story to the kids.)",nx3jdq
h1mnrsn,Gave me heavy Princess Bride vibes with the interuptions of the story telling.,nx3jdq
h1cw0f1,"Also Mr Softee was George Washington haha I didn't realize it until the end credits sequence.

h1d2g5k,"That was the perfect type of easter egg for this movie too! Nothing too obvious, but nice and subtle",nx3jdq
h1dni3a,I squealed in the theater at that part and heard no other reactions. They were not my people lol.,nx3jdq
h1f8uyy,Ugh I thought I recognized it but I convinced myself it was just a melody from the film. Anyone got a timestamp?,nx3jdq
h1kxbcp,"I was so bummed it didn't make it! I understand why, but it's literally one of my favs, and that's a hard list to decide! I immediately played it after I finished the film!",nx3jdq
h2gl2it,I definitely at times wondered if they were implying that they were a couple. There are moments when they seem to be physically closer to each other than platonic friends would be but it isn't obvious.,nx3jdq
h360nf1,"I’m currently reading the book and it was said that the decision to make Daniela and Carla a married couple was kinda last minute when they killed off Mrs. Rosario and realized all the families were broken (widowed, orphaned, etc.). The bed scene was one of the last scenes shot.",nx3jdq
h2cfkgg,Yeah I never got that vibe from any of then either. Like as you said the trio thing made it seem more like a mother daughters relationship than a couple,nx3jdq

h25wz31,"as someone who is super into costumes i notice stuff like this too so i’m glad you mentioned it!  the costuming felt very real to me, no one is super trendy and if they are trying to be it’s cheap forever 21 type stuff. Nina wears the same american eagle shorts that tons of high schoolers from the 2010s own. and i noticed some older women wearing BeBe brand shirts which i always remember seeing when growing up",nx3jdq
h1p0q7r,Yeah I kept noting the clothing.,nx3jdq
h2k3uqz,"I kind of hated most of Vanessa's clothing considering she wanted a career in fashion (especially the long sleeved mesh top on the hottest day of the blackout?? Wtf?), but now that you pointed it out I like that they wore relatable brands!",nx3jdq

h1klf5p,"as a afro latino, i hate they cut out this part of Benny's storyline.

most of the racism ive experienced have been from other latinos, and it feels like LMM/Chu are trying to make it seem like that doesnt exist in our communities. and Benny isnt even from the islands, which makes him even more of a outsider",nx3jdq
h1io6v9,I said this elsewhere but also losing “Everything I Know” (a moment I was looking forward to just bawling my eyes out through) also kind of cut down on Nina’s personal character development for me.,nx3jdq
h1kc7qs,"I'm surprised by how much I miss Nina's mom. ""Enough"" is absolutely on my In The Heights favorite songs list, and losing it was a big bummer for me. I think Inulti and Enough are absolutely essential songs to the show, and if they wanted to cut the character, I would've been down to see Benny perform that song, maybe with some tweaks.",nx3jdq

h1gvtc5,"I think he's pretty much guaranteed an oscar this year since he has so many projects.

Music wise he just released In The Heights and after he has two animated films for which he provided music. Vivo (Sony/Netflix) and Encanto (Disney).

I think between the animated films and the new song for In The Heights he may get a few music nominations if possible. 

Also he is directing Tick Tick Boom so he could possibly get something with that.",nx3jdq
h1dd9dm,Serious question - do songs adapted from a musical qualify for best original song?,nx3jdq
h1e89v9,Miranda has Encanto and one other animated musical this year and he does music for Little Mermaid remake too so he doesn’t need to win for this nessecarily.,nx3jdq
h1de89j,Dont forget Dear Evan Hansen is also coming out soon.  Original Song will be an interesting fight to watch.,nx3jdq
h1sim6y,I think it’s got to be a favorite for best cinematography. Possibly production design too. This film was so well shot,nx3jdq

Also real quick, I know it’s sort of the point that she doesn’t have to move downtown to succeed, but what the hell is Vanessa thinking moving to the west village with her savings? A studio is like 3,500 a month. What an insane financial decision.",nx3jdq
h1de7ms,"Didn't like that change, in the play the mural was of abuela Claudia",nx3jdq
h1l0fkr,Agreed. Also the fact that it was inside the bodega instead of on the grate indicate that it’s more emblematic of Usnavi’s personal journey rather than the entire community.,nx3jdq

h37l6iv,"Nina's story gets me every time. I always cry with her struggle, it resonates so much!

h1eah0s,"It was strange... Cuca's character literally did nothing except third wheel on Daniela and Carla. I thought the purring thing at Usnavi at the beginning just came across as sleazy / creepy. I like the actress but it felt really strange to have her in a role for nothing. Like you said, maybe she just wanted to cameo.",nx3jdq
h1mjnvl,"Yes, Usnavi says in the play ""It takes most of that cash to save my ass from financial ruin"" and it feels so down to earth. In the movie he's like ""I've got money, reserve the Sueñito! I win the lotto! Here have the money Sonny, I'm already a rich bish.""

h1mtz0m,I wonder if they cut Kevin’s song to try and attract a more established actor for the role. Asides from that one song Kevin doesn’t really sing a whole lot. Easier to convince a notable actor to take the role it the singing is minimal.,nx3jdq
h1lojuw,Blackout was changed a bit. The argument that Nina and Benny have is given to Vanessa and Usnavi and the $96k reveal is done later.,nx3jdq
h1nukgw,"Future Benny had a bunch of cheats I didn't like.   The movie starts out in the beach so you assume he went to the Dominican Republic but at the end of  the movie the ""beach"" is actually his New York store with beach paintings, despite it being a real beach the entire movie.  Benny says nobody won, only to find out that Abuela won and gave the ticket to Benny who uses it to pay for Sonny.

Especially since it's going out walking like that in the heat that kills her.,nx3jdq
h2fc96b,I thought the takeaway was that his fight would be messy and might end in heartbreak. That was “what happens to Sonny”. He’s meant as a representation of dreamers and that’s the experience they wanted to convey.,nx3jdq

h1czwqi,"You summed up my thoughts on the lottery ticket perfectly. Didn’t hate the change, but much preferred the way the musical handled it.

Wanted to add that the other major changes are that in the musical, Nina and Benny are the main romantic leads. Their argument lines in “Blackout” were given to Usnavi and Vanessa and several of their songs were cut. “Sunrise” and “Everything I know” are especially missing.

Also the blackout is a bigger deal in the musical as time passes much slower. Most of act 2 takes place during it, thus the chilled bottle of champagne Vanessa brings and the open fire hydrants are more meaningful. 

9/10 film though!!",nx3jdq
h1dawrh,"I'm actually okay with the way the lotto ticket was revealed. In the movie, Usnavi had to struggle his way out of the Barrio and had the means to go to the DR due to his own hardwork, and not something that you have a million to one odds to win. I think it sends a better message without having to change the plot of the musical a lot.",nx3jdq
h1d6ulz,"I didn't get that Daniela and Carla were a couple at all though? Did I miss something? What made you think they were?

Also, I felt it was maybe the other way around with the mom, that they had to sacrifice some songs and narrative threads for the sake of brevity and Enough was one of them, along with that little conflict between her and Kevin.

It also makes sense cause the song was prompted by Nina spending the night with Benny that night but they cut that out too. They added the Dreamers storyline so they had to make narrative sacrifices, unfortunately.

I've always loved the song but it wasn't super necessary in the narrative. Then once the song and conflict were out they didn't feel they needed the Mom character.

However I disagree about Nina. I think it’s completely understandable that she would push back on her father selling the business considering most of the movie she doesnt seem to know what she’s doing at Stanford anyway/kind of reads as if she’s undeclared etc. Like everybody’s telling her she represents all of them and is their “best” but she doesn’t have any clear academic goals. Plus there’s always the sense that because your parents sacrifice so much you have to repay them eventually and she has no idea how to do that. The few lines about micro aggressions shes faced that you seemed to have zeroed in on were probably a contributing factor but not all of it. I think that’s why it gets resolved with her figuring out she wants to do advocacy work or whatever (the way they wrapped this up I wish had been fleshed out more but whatever).",nx3jdq

I get the story it's trying to tell and I appreciate all the different characters representing different types of people and struggles in the community. I've never watched the original broadway so I'm not sure how it compares.

About Nina though, she was the ONLY character I related to.  Long story short, twenty years ago my parents literally gave up their careers, family and uprooted their whole life to bring me and my brother to a western country when we were young, so we could have a better upbringing. But fast forward to after uni, I decided that I needed more opportunities and wanted to live in a *big city*, so I moved back to my parents' hometown- then suddenly, the city is literally being turned into a police state, I was there for protests and tear-gas and witnessed police violence and unlawful things happening every day, freedom of press is snuffed out and I work in the media. I have a foreign passport, and all my friends and family from both sides keep asking me why I don't leave and go home, I could have a better future, but I just *can't*. I feel like I'm betraying the city and the ""fight"" if I leave, and more than that- I'm *scared.* Where I am now- I have a community, the majority of people are on the same side because we were all here to witness it happen, I'm scared if I leave and go to a western country where no one experienced the same thing, people will question *why* we did it, or question if it's even a big deal, make light of the situation, or worse- I'll be working, living and in the same circle of people who *support* the oppressive side. So while some might think I'm crazy or ungrateful- since my parents literally uprooted their whole lives for me to *not* be exactly where I am now, I just don't think I can live like that- move away and live in ""peace"", not anymore. Nina's story made me think though.",nx3jdq
h23xwb4,">The only scenes I found remotely involving were Abuela's hallucination before dying, because at least finally there was a scene where someone approaching a real person sang a song that expressed an emotion more complicated than ""I'm in love and I rep for my hood, but also I have big dreams and don't know where I belong,"" and the opening scene, because it has a stylistic zest and a verve the rest of the film is missing entirely.

This is probably the only song I'll go back to and listen in the future. Pretty disappointing since I really liked almost every song from Hamilton and still listen to many of them over a year after seeing it.

What having that community feeling that is celebrated in this film would feel is a mystery to me, but one that I want and found myself yearning for more while watching the film.

h1dd34q,"I 100% agree. I generally see In the Heights as two main storyline that intersect. One is the bodega/lotto ticket story that's focused on Usnavi and the other is the Rosario story which is Nina centric. 

As you said, most of the songs and story cuts dealt with the Nina side of the story. Cutting ""Inutil"" and Nina's mom entirely resulted in Nina's relationship and ongoing conflict with her Dad being not as fleshed out. And the changes to her and Benny's relationship removed some of their most important moments (the big Act I ending kiss in Blackout, Sunrise, Kevin Rosario kicking Benny out), making their relationship not as developed while further taking away from the Nina/Kevin dynamic. I can understand why the writers wanted to remove Kevin Rosario's rascism toward Benny, but all of those changes collectively made the Rosario story seem flatter to me.",nx3jdq
h1fqt9v,"I think Nina's smaller role unfortunately was the result of two things: 1) like you said, bolstering Vanessa and Usnavi as main characters, and also 2) removing Mr. Rosario's disapproval towards Benny, they completely re-contextualized the relationship there, and led to a lot of songs being cut/rearranged. I think both changes were really good for the movie in 2021, but it did make Nina's arc and her relationship with Benny feel a little flatter, like you noticed.

I do think it's powerful Nina is inspired by reflection on Sonny's situation, as opposed to Claudia, even though Everything I Know is so beautiful. It does leave a bit of an empty spot of what Abuela Claudia's death/impact on the community was, but this is kind of mitigated by the end reveal of the lottery ticket I think.

I think the changes they made were important for the movie but I agree Nina did get short changed, she appeared more of a supporting character. I think it was the best they could do though.",nx3jdq
h2fdowe,"The “controversy” felt very manufactured. By that I mean, it’s fine to have criticisms of the film and casting, but it didn’t seem like anything that really felt like a “controversy”. I think the defensiveness and awkwardness in the responses made it seem worse than it was.

h2h6awl,"I loved this movie and I really didn’t think I would. But that ONE line made me see red. It was SOOO disrespectful. I actually had to rewind to be sure I’d heard right.

First, ma’am is considered a respectful term to call a woman here in the US. And isn’t the whole point of the movie that immigrants want to live here? So why would you upset that someone is calling you a name that is respectful in American culture? Just the way she said it was so ugly and then she and Usnavi basically did a mental high-five afterward like, “yeah, we showed that stupid idiot white man.” She could have just said “I prefer to be called Senorita,” and that would have been fine. He seemed like a nice man who would have respected that choice and probably even apologized for not knowing.

Second, exactly WHAT message was this virtue signal trying to say anyway?? Because it certainly didn’t make her look good.

It was a bad movie, plain and simple. My opinion? It is on the list for one of the worst movies I've ever seen, though I'm being harder on it because it is a big budget Hollywood movie, and it is supposed to be directed, produced, and acted by professionals. 

I saw the stage version too (and imagine you have, from your love of theater), and even I couldn't tell what the hell was going on during the movie. The lyrics in the songs were mumbled and garbled due to some mistake either in their sound capture tech, or a rushed production (ironically never a problem in the stage version, at least when I've seen it). The scenes and dialogue didn't flow; I'm reminded of how poorly the scenes progressed and transitioned in Star Wars The Last Jedi (which I felt was amateurishly done, despite again being a major Hollywood production with a big budget and professionals behind-the-scenes), except In The Heights was even worse in this regard. I at least could sit through The Last Jedi until the end; I got up at left In The Heights after suffering through an hour and a half of it. 

The characters were strangely sexualized, which felt out of place with both the children story-time framing device, and social justice messaging forced into the movie. The director forced the two main heroines into skimpy outfits for some reason: Usnavi's love interest in low cut tops and bikinis, and Nina Rosario in short-shorts and high heels. 

I was expecting a fun, feel good movie (maybe something like Crazy Rich Asians, which I loved. Same director, after all).

As for Nina's storyline (as someone who intentionally avoided listening/reading the plot of the play in order to go in fresh, I was shocked and (at the same time) pleasantly surprised at how close Nina's storyline hit to home (as the academically competent child of immigrants who grew up in a predominately immigrant neighbourhood in a major city attending a solid uni on the other side of the country who lied to their parents about financial deadlines (even though they were willing to pay) in order to transfer schools. I've read in the play that she initially had to drop out due to holding multiple jobs and not being able to concentrate in classes but I feel the film version heightens the level of guilt that many second-generation immigrants feel of failing due to obviously having it easier than their parents and having to face ""lesser hurdles"" (so-called micro-agressions vs.  overt racism). You kick yourself at your weakness while you walk the streets you never thought you would have to again. Man, the nuances of that experience could only come from people who were able to personally relate to it and why ITH is such a strong and important story to tell especially for representation",nx3jdq

But I took it as part and parcel of the experience. It's meant to be a slice of life of a minority community, and all the little references scattered here and there make it feel more authentic. Combined with the kind of ""magical realism"" of the singing and dancing made it feel a little bit more exotic and fantastical.

My wife pointed this out to me as well, as she doesn't speak Spanish; it assumes the audience knows Spanish, but will have subtitles for random phrases (while others do not). This wasn't an issue in the stage musical, by the way.

It occurred to me that the director did the same thing with the political issues he shoe-horned into the film. The kid in the film talks about how they're going to ""deport the dreamers"", when ""dreamers"" is never defined in the film, and is never mentioned again. A bunch of superficial liberal imagery is introduced (gentrification, white people getting preference for apartment rentals), but is quickly forgotten by the story.

h1ot4ew,"I think your comment highlights something I wrote earlier in that this film has a danger (outside of the stunning visuals) of speaking to a niche audience (immigrants/kids of immigrants/predominately immigrant neighbourhoods) who can more easily fill in the blanks (that some are bringing up due to claims of character/plot underdevelopment) that may have been lost given that it perhaps takes its viewers for granted (i.e. assumes it doesn't have to do as much exposition/explaining).

For instance, growing up in a lower socio-economic community around the same people (some of whom are, to put it politely, ""not going anywhere with their lives"") or perhaps less ambitious is enough in and of itself to drive oneself out of the neighbourhood so people familiar with that experience are able to easily write that part in without explicitly saying it. The lower-end grocery stores, the preponderance of payday loan centres, the items under lock and key at many establishments are just some of the other push factors that people who have that life experience could empathise with Vanessa right away without being told anything extra. 

As for Nina story, this is the so-called ""acting white""/brain drain dilemma that many kids of immigrants (particularly visible minorities) have to deal with. Again, something the audience has to write into the plot is the isolation she must have felt being smart, hard-working, and driven in a way that many of her peers were not (for a myriad of reasons; some self-inflicted, some not). She must've consoled herself with the fact that while her peers were having fun, or dropping out, that she was going to leave there, get into a good school, and never have to look back. The inability, however, to truly escape the stigma of being from Washington Heights at Stanford coupled with the humiliation of not being able to cut (perhaps, having to end up working shoulder to shoulder in the same low-paying jobs as her peers) is another thing people with that experience would relate to without being told and it's only until she stops trying to escape her community, when she stops thinking of herself as ""better"" for having gotten out (i.e. ""I worked hard, they didn't, and they made fun of me for doing so, they deserve to be where they are"") but rather gaining an epiphany to use her skills to aid those who have been less fortunate in her community is something that is going to act as a motivating fire/light for her on the days she can't put up with her isolation at Stanford; to be proud, rather than ashamed from where she's from (i.e. ""let me listen to my block"").

All that to say is there's a legitimate debate to be had if/whether the onus is on the director/screenplay/script/actors to have made these things explicit given that, for this film to work, you kind of have to assume all those things I mentioned earlier (which is why I feel certain audiences will resonate with this film to such a level that that exposition/explanation isn't needed). That audience will, in turn, feel that after having had to do that for so many other films, the shoe is now on the other foot for once where other audiences feel what it's like for a work of art to assume knowledge that they don't have from their own lived experience. All in all, I loved the film (never saw the musical) but, at the same time, I understand people's critiques; critiques people are well within their rights to make. 

PS I upvoted your comment because I feel good faith/genuine/respectful disagreements about something don't merit downvoting. We can agree to disagree lol",nx3jdq
h1ouyxu,I enjoyed the movie and agree with your plot and character points.  A big thing for me is I didn’t buy the Vanessa/Usnavi relationship.,nx3jdq
h1qe6l7,"I think you missed some plot points. 

Vanessa’s salon was moving downtown. The location would be better for fashion and without moving she would likely need to find a new job or spend all her extra time and money moving. 

The goal is not “thrown out.” She uses the paint rags as her new muse after she moves and no longer has the train to inspire her. The scene directly before they reveal the mural shows how she’s turning the paint rags into a new urban fashion design. So literally the last scene we see with her, she is restarting working on her goal. 

Nina didn’t have any intrinsic motivation for going to Stanford. She only had extrinsic motivation: her father’s sacrifices and the expectations of her community. Once she finds an intrinsic motivation, she realizes she can deal with the bullshit because Stanford will give her the tools and connections she needs to make a difference, which she can’t get staying locally.

What the film doesn’t do is give us closure: We don’t know if Sonny will get a green card, we don’t know if Vanessa will succeed in fashion, we don’t know if Nina will finish school, and we don’t know if Usnavi’s business and the other local businesses will survive gentrification.

h1czz6c,"That's how the original song from broadway goes @ 3:37

The point of it is to break up the song and and transition into the counterpoint. Counterpoints being what each of them are going to do if they won (them singing over eachother). Counterpoints are VERY popular in musical theater and is a trope of theater (made popular buy Jonathan Larson in rent: Christmas bells and No day but today). You sing out your counterpoint (which is the whole reason of this song) ie: Going to business school, give the barriro an education, Go to DR, and then Vanessa (You'll never see me again/going downtown). 

Then once they reach a resolution (end of counter point).  they all join in on the 

    We'll get the dough ‘n'
    Once we get goin'
    We're never gonna stop!

Which is the resolution of what theyre ALL going to do if they won 96,000 which is them not stopping. (Non-stop? Hamilton? whaaaaaaa---? )

I can see why and how some people may not like it (if not from a predominate musical theater background).

h2hwmqf,">Enjoyed it for the Disney-fied escapism it was.

I actually hoped it would be more like this--another *Crazy Rich Asians* or *Legally Blonde*. 

I see it as (without exaggeration) one of the worst movies I have ever seen, primarily due to how sloppily it is written, edited, and produced, especially since it is a high budget Hollywood production. Just as you imply, it is aimed at a primarily white liberal audience--let's face it, they are the ""moby dicks"" the producers are aiming for, with the most money to spend--and you can get away with forcing in some woke shit if it's a good movie. 

This isn't a good movie. In fact, I just realized an apt comparison, if you're familiar with it: *The Angry Video Game Nerd Movie*. Similar to *In the Heights*, this was a movie that was so poorly made that it is unwatchable. The boredom sets in to the *Angry Video Game Nerd Movie* maybe ten minutes in; *In the Heights* had me checking my watch about an hour in. The major difference, of course, is that the former had a budget in the hundreds of thousands, while the latter had a budget  approaching $80 million (after the marketing budget).

Professional reviews of the film center around how much of an underdog figure Lin Manual-Miranda is. He's being built up to be a sort of ""Elon Musk"" figure within his own band, which is to say that I see a clear cult of personality around him. Read a published review, and you're likely to learn about how ""happy"" LMM is to see his creation find success.",nx3jdq

I'm not a big musical guy but I really enjoyed it. John Cho's direction works perfectly here with his love of huge, sweeping shots. I felt like the cast really nailed it as well. I will say it's quite long and you really have to pay attention because the rap lyrics go pretty quickly and they switch from English to Spanish at times (nothing not covered in an intro high school course) so you do have to stay engaged. If that doesn't sound appealing, then you might not enjoy it.",nx3jdq
h1jnvk7,"First thing you should know is that it's shot like a movie musical. It's not a pro-shot of the stage play like Hamilton. That said, it's very song-heavy. A song comes pretty much every 5-10 minutes.

Well, it's one of the best movies of all time, sheer (almost) perfection.

There are good musicals out there, but they're quite difficult to do. What do you think about ""Umbrellas of Cherbourg""?",nx3jdq

h1cvz4e,"I really liked the film, I just feel like having seen Hamilton first made it somewhat underwhelming. 

Some of the songs hit the same beats as the Hamilton songs I've been singing for the past year and I think it would have been better to have seen ""In The Heights"" first and THEN seen some of those same song writing tactics and melodies applied to the historical context of Hamilton. 

The parallels between ""Powerless"" and ""Helpless"" and several of the other tracks kept me from feeling blown away like I did when I saw Hamilton for the first time. I turned to my wife and said ""Lin only knows how to write 6 different songs...but he writes the HELL out of em""  Still enjoyed it tho, especially the later half.

Update: also why is nobody talking about the laughably bad green screen on Usnavi during the pool scene? What WAS that? 

Update 2: Myself, my wife and daughter all LOVED the movie and will watch it and listen to the soundtrack over and over again. It is a remarkable film. It shouldn't be above minor criticism tho.",nx3jdq

I think it's fair for citizens of Washington Heights to talk about how the movie could have been more accurate, and for Afro-Latino people to discuss how the film could have been even more inclusive, but I'm just not seeing any white washing or erasure going on in the film.

The main things are Rosario family has a bigger storyline, Nina's mum is alive and both of her parents have solo songs. Benny and Nina's relationship has another song ""Sunrise"" - one of my favourites about the blackout night, referenced in ""Carnival del Barrio"" as going for a roll in the hay. ;) Vanessa's fashion story is only very vague in the show and Usnavi's father / old bar is new to the film.

The musical has more songs and generally the quality of singing is going to be higher (as expected). The lawyer-ish guy, dry cleaning guy, Cuca, Sonny's father all don't exist in the show. Sonny isn't explicitly undocumented. Carla and Daniela aren't hinted to be in a relationship. Usnavi and Vanessa aren't confirmed / don't have a kid. And the blackout lasts almost the whole second half of the musical (from memory it's still ongoing at the end).",nx3jdq

I survived  
I did it

The lottery ticket reveal in the broadway production is a really organic moment of surprise that's still really cool (it happens much, much earlier in the story). I just found it particularly moving that the change turned the number into a poignant reflection of Abuela Claudia's life while on her deathbed.

h2i9dfa,">Not having scene the show on stage, I really liked how they >!framed that number as a literal dream sequence where she decides whether she stays or moves on.!<

I liked the dream sequence too. In fact, I think it's the best thing to do with the scene even though in the musical, >!it is not a song she sings as she is dying, but rather expresses her complicated feelings after winning the lottery.!< 

I was worried they'd do a straight up flashback sequence. But I don't think that's a good way to handle it. Because part of the song is that her memories are contaminated, not fully sorted out, and complicated. The song does a good job performing how memories sort of crash into each other haphazardly as you think them, taking you on these wild trips from one bit of time to another, rather than playing out a linear narrative from start to finish. And so I thought a straight up flashback would make it too concrete: this is not her re-experiencing her history, this is her reflecting on a complicated group of thoughts from her present perspective. 

Anyway, this is all to say that I think going a more artsy, and in many ways, very broadway-y vibe with it, with a set of dancers in monochrome miming the objects of her thoughts, rather than flat out depicting the past onscreen, was a *much* better choice than what I had expected them to do with it.",nx3jdq

HOWEVER, it doesn't greatly detract from the film all that greatly? More diversity in regards to race always helps, and if anything, I have seen an increase in homelessness and ""crackheads"" the movie misses out on too. Bakeries and churches are huge here, and as I mentioned in another comment, way more emphasis on piragua than necessary. Old women throwing pan de manteca or hard white rice for pigeons to feed. Older men are more perverted than the movie leads on, haha, but they still captured the cat calling well.

So all in all, the movie has its faults, so I wouldn't undermine the controversy, but it's missing little details here and there anyway. However, that alone makes it a pretty good movie, because I am not criticizing based on the big picture.

Anyway, if they had more afro-latino main/side characters, it would be more representative.

I thought or think this movie was set in a different time period. I have been in Washington Heights since I was 1 (I'm 21 now), so I'm not sure what the Heights was truly like before 2007 since all I did was go to school and come home. That's my take on it.",nx3jdq

h229lu3,"I'm gonna have to politely disagree with you on your first point - the best musicals have airtight plots, and use their musical numbers to advance the narrative.

Also, here's relevant plot information tossed into one line of singing and not at all given the emotional weight it deserves!"" typically at the same relentlessly optimistic pitch with the exact same kind of dancing. Or if not that, then they're just repeating information we've heard before or that we know already. This person is into that person. This person is unhappy with their status in life. This person loves their culture and neighborhood. This person is. . .sassy and owns a hair salon and likes gossip and that's kind of it. Okay, right - but we got all that already. Many, many times.

As far as Nina goes - nah. Look, that's a very teenage dilemma. The narrative wants us to sympathize with her, but I just can't do it. She acts like a brat towards her father the entire way through the film, the guy who literally sold his business and is scrimping everywhere to pay for her tuition, and while I agree that micro-aggressions can be frustrating to deal with, man - as an actual real-life poor person, naw. You figure out what you're doing with your life and you go back to school. That's literally all the guy wants from you, is just *to go*, so you can have a better life than he did. And again, we've seen this stuff so many times before in so many different places - girl doesn't know what she wants to do, feels pressured by her family to go to college but it's ""just not my dream!

Then the actual date is this weird jealousy battle where they actively don't spend time together or listen to one another, to the point of getting into an argument immediately after.

h1nnjp0,"I thought it was because the timeline was changed- the blackout of the original was the one that hit us in '99 and the one in movie is some imaginary combination of 'em from the 2000's- The '99 blackout had the looting concerns of the OG script but the later ones were just everyone chilling and basically just having block parties? They were very different experiances.

I did feel like the panic in a club that goes dark was a little played down, however- I always assumed there was a little bit of a human crush going on at the doors during Blackout because it at least gives Vanessa one reason to be shitty since she was legit scared.

h1ladgi,"Unpopular opinion, but (having not seen the musical prior) I actually like the Nina plot here (though I understand parallel similarities to my personal experience may be at play here lol) I saw a critique point out that Stanford is close to 1/5th Hispanic but what's interesting to note is a) being on the west coast its probably Mexican (as Hispanics are not a racial group per se; there's Afro-Latinos, the infamous ""White Hispanics"" etc.) and b) even minorities who attend elite colleges tend to come from wealthier socio-economic backgrounds so it is realistic for Nina to feel out of place. Additionally, what I like about her voluntarily not wanting to return is that shame she feels at having failed. She's well aware of the sacrifice her dad has made for her and she knows the racism she's faced (in the form of so-called microaggressions) pales in comparison to the overt racism her family had to face (and her dad is footing the bill as opposed to her having to work for her tuition). This leads her to having more self-loathing for herself for not being able to handle the adversity where if she couldn't cut it because of working additional jobs to pay for school, it's more sympathetic and understandable. In other words, she kind of has no real excuse not to succeed which makes her failure feel all the more self-imposed (i.e. ""it's her fault""). Thus she feels as if she's let everybody down which is a really interesting angle to take as opposed to making her an easy character to sympathise with in that she's working multiple jobs. This really speaks to a second-generation immigrant experience that has gone (I think) unexplored in popular media (since they're always touted as hard-working success stories) though I understand that on a mass appeal level, it may not be as easy for audiences unable to see that perspective to resonate so easily with it (which is why you can debate whether it should've been changed).",nx3jdq

This was a decently common criticism of the play even when it was released, especially among academic criticism.

It makes sense to me to want to refocus the story such that it is the protagonist's own hard work that pays off for him (and the community) in the end. But in making that change, you are forced to totally overhaul the rest of the movie. You have to make the lottery thing into a secondary plot point. You take away all the set up of it that's woven through multiple songs. And it changes Usnavi's struggle at the end of the film substantially.

Broadway musical performers are all extraordinary accomplished singers to be getting a gig there, they get paid to sing 8 times a week.

Abuela’s philosophy of asserting dignity in small ways is new to the movie, but is a good thread that plays well into Nina’s modified arc.

I think I’m also biased by own experience in the opposite direction and more strongly relate to her original story.

I do like some of the look and feel of the older/classic musicals because they're like a time capsule and just have a 'smaller' feel from these big production musicals...but I don't really enjoy watching them just kinda appreciate they feel a bit more real.  Some of the musicals like La La Land and In The Heights just don't have that same sort of feel.. the productions are too big or something.

>Any camera movement doesn't have a purpose, it's just movement. It's inconsequential. It's clearly a stage musical.

96,000 did things a stage musical could literally never physically do (graphics, scale, *water*).

h1l6esb,"Honestly, there are so many I don’t know where to start. 

It was a money grab. The studio was like Les Mis was successful, let’s get that guy and do Cats, which was never going to translate well. 

So many of his direction choices were insane. In the Heights has been praised for going full Busby Berkeley with the big dance numbers. Cats tried that, but it was all CGI, and it was all mice, and then Rebel Wilson ate the mice? I am kind of glad I don’t remember exactly. It was awful though. That wasn’t even the most batshit part necessarily.

They hired Rebel Wilson and James Corden for the parts of these two cats and then contrived a storyline where they’d get kidnapped and conveniently absent from all the other scenes. 

I won’t even get into all the problems they had with the CGI not actually being finished at the time it started playing in theaters, but it speaks to how out of the control the project got, how much they over relied on weird special effects and then left no time for them to be completed.

It just lacked any sort of warmth and was instead a mish mosh of failed ideas and stunt casting. I’m sure someone else can give you an itemized list of every mistake. 

I think the number one takeaway is only make movie musicals out of musicals that will translate well to a screen. In the Heights is a generally realistic story. It fits well on screen and the writer and director made a lot of good choices. It also had great music which is essential. 

I hope all the other ones in the works have the similarly competent creative teams behind them.",nx3jdq
h1pqu29,"1) Choose a musical that says something/has a point ideally. There's nothing *necessarily* wrong with just going 100% spectacle, but having any kind of plot or end goal increases your value a lot. 

2) Don't be afraid to make small changes to adapt your movie to a modern audience. For Heights, that meant updating lyrics to make more sense well over a decade after the Broadway show debuted. For Cats, that could have meant choosing to not make Cats. 

3) Biggest lesson of all imo: Stunt casting is a fucking terrible idea. Cast people who will make your movie good, not just people who you think will make your movie money. La La Land *kind of* made it work (though Ryan Gosling's singing voice is still offensive as hell), but critically they only had two A-listers who they had to try to train. Cats ENTIRE cast is comprised of A-listers, the majority of whom shouldn't be there. In the Heights on the other hand doesn't have a single A-List lead, and the most famous actors in the movie (with the exception of Stephanie) all became famous on Broadway. 

4) Live action movies are better in real locations. The only scene in In the Heights that was shot on a green screen was the wall dance, and that fact *shows* throughout the movie. You can feel the neighborhood and the reality of the location. Cats, on the other hand, is pretty much all green screen or might as well be. Worse, the fake locations look really bad. I can't put my finger on it, but the main outdoor street they're on for a lot of the movie just has a strong feeling of being indoors, on a soundstage. Nothing about it feels like they shot in any real locations, or for that matter like they even visited any. Cats is green screen for life and they don't care who knows it.

5) Details matter. Cats was very rushed and unfinished, and a lot of details were totally ignored until after release. Any movie is gonna have its share of mistakes (and I can name plenty for Heights) but Cats was riddled with them throughout, and you could tell they spent all their FX budget on the fur and none on the way the cats interacted with their environment.

Sorry for my rambling but tl;dr: pick a good musical to begin with and then cast it based on talent over status. Cash grabs backfire; put a modicum of effort into your shit.",nx3jdq

As I mentioned, I think ""Hamilton's"" songs are better/more memorable (after all, they're coming from a more experienced writer) but I think ""Hamilton"" and ""In the Heights"" speak to two different audiences which may affect preferences. For instance, Hamilton makes the claim that it's central character is an ""orphan immigrant"" and that ""immigrants get the job done"" but in the context of building a nation that didn't previously exist, when everything on this side of the Atlantic was a colony and where Massachusetts Bay and Virginia were seen as different (British) colonies it's much more a redemptive American story; the Founding Fathers (whom people who identify primarily and solely as Americans can relate to) played by those Americans who lived in America but who's rights were denied to them. And I think that's the split; people who identify as primarily or solely American (regardless of race/most of America) will relate to ""Hamilton"" more as it's literally about the creation of that identity that those people hold most dear. ""In the Heights"" will appeal to (as the film notes) those first to fifth-generation Americans who knew someone in living memory who came from somewhere else who have dual or multiple national identities (other than just ancestry) AND who also live in predominately immigrant/working class neighbourhoods; that is to say if Unsanvi grew up in Waterloo, Iowa or even The Hamptons we're telling a different story of assimilation, integration, and acceptance into the American identity (kind of like Hamilton) versus growing up in an area where you can switch between English and Spanish and where the majority of people can relate to that immigrant experience even if they don't share the exact same nationality).",nx3jdq
h1qo20x,"Yeah, also it’s weird she just wanted to get out, move downtown, then become all of a sudden in the fashion biz (saw someone else point this out).  The characters needed more fleshing out.

>Dude I am literally an editor and that is literally every single edited piece of content in existence. Like our whole job is creating a series of videoclips, including your so-called ""transcendent cinema."" That's like saying Hamlet sucks because it's a series of words.

Videoclips are the style created for MTV. Music videos for the TV era. It's from the 1980s.

>96,000 did things a stage musical could literally never physically do (graphics, scale, water). Sentient mannequins in No Me Diga, Nina's childhood self following her around in Breathe and When You're Home, the fabrics in the sky during It Won't Be Long Now, literally the entire visualization on the side of a building for When the Sun Goes Down--say what you want, express your opinion, but the idea that nothing was done to enhance the stage performance of those numbers is just objectively wrong. NONE of those elements were in the stage production.

That's not my point at all. 

> I personally find most old films boring as fuck and prefer quicker editing.

Jesus fucking Christ. By the way, it is not about duration of shots, but how it is done and what's the new meaning produced. I don't like film theory too much but you need to read Eisenstein to work in editing, right? The basics?

She mentioned being invited to diversity dinner with patrons. That in itself implies she had enough scholarships for the school to recognize her as an important student. If getting a full ride including room and board still wasn't affordable enough, why couldn't she go to a community college closer to home? Also, I bought her story for feeling alone--up until I realized they had iPhones and cell phones in the blackout--which means she had full capability to use facetime and keep in contact with everyone she knows in her neighborhood. Why didn't she rant off to her friends by calling them when something happened at school? Girlfriends build up each other. They would've helped her keep the confidence she needed to stay in school. Also WHY did she keep wearing sweaters in each scene during 90 degree weather!? I loved her outfits, but still the characters weren't dressed like they were going to melt.",nx3jdq

But we also don’t all come from the same country let alone do we all have the same shared traditions. Not to mention the language is inclusive of people who have different gender identities and sexualities. I’ve never heard of anyone in academia denounce the term Latinx.

Shots mean something in every work unless you have proof otherwise. Additionally, if you recognize Edgar Wright's talent then you have the ability to suck a director's dick that didn't die 50 years ago.
