ec0sq0r,"Left the theater an hour ago and the turnout was surprisingly pretty high. Legitimate goosebumps the first time the color & voices kick in. Really took me by surprise. Jaw-dropping achievement by Peter Jackson. Overtakes *McQueen*/*Free Solo* as my favorite doc of the year, for sure.

Did anyone stay for the 30-minute mini-documentary after? How was it?",a5yk8k
ec1jfy9,"I had the privilege of seeing a screening last night.

When I got home, I was trying to explain to my wife how I felt leaving the theater. When it starts, using the standard, grainy footage, it felt like an objective, typical documentary.

Then you transition with the men off the boat while the sound of the shells begin and the colorized film comes on. Over the next hour, I became so ""used"" to seeing the soldiers as if they were being filmed today.

During the conclusion, the screen pulls back both in size and in quality (going back to the old, grainy footage). I felt myself physically leaning towards the screen as the transition took place. It felt like these men, who I had gotten to know over the past hour, were falling back in time. Its as if they were brought to 2018 for that one hour then had to go back to 1918. I felt legitimate longing for them to stay; to see more of their lives. 

Edit: One other thing that truly stood out was the sound of the shells throughout the movie. I had gotten so used to the constant explosions in the background that, when they stopped at the Armistice, was extremely jarring.

ec0wx0u,"Reposting thoughts from previous thread.

Hey just wanted to give my two cents as an editor and compositor. I’m sure many more of us from the industry can weigh in so I just want to give my own personal take. 

Seeing the test reels of the footage just looked so unreal. Remember this is 100 year old footage done mostly by amateur filmmakers at the early days of cinema so to get any kind of resolution out of them seems insane. But seeing it full I can see they picked the shots that looked the best. There’s a ton of spacial warping that occurs from the stabilization, especially in the portrait style shots likely due to the lack of a tripod. There’s also just clearly a limit to how much data is available as faces often become a blurry approximation of a face. Motion is right out, any charging becomes a total blurry mess. And perhaps most surprising to me is smoke and explosions look awful. They look like terrible plugin effects which I find really fascinating. Something about the interpolation just makes the smoke turn into this weird blob. 

I only bring all this up to say **this film looks and sounds incredible** (I bolded this in case people gave up on my nitpick paragraph). They have pushed their attempts to modernize the footage as far as I think you possible can without just remaking the footage entirely. I mean remember these were hand cranked cameras, so we are talking about jittery no locked down shots with wildly differing frame rates each few seconds. I can’t even begin to imagine how they tackled the frame rate issues let alone stabilization or colorization. 


It’s really quite amazing and I think by far the most important element is the sound design. World War 1 is always in black and white and silent. You change that and you realize just how grimy and scary and awful being in those trenches was. And the soundscape of all the soldiers telling their story is absolutely brilliant. Because Jackson just doesn’t have footage of some stuff (namely the charge over the line) he wisely uses sound as the connection feature so when suddenly you have 10 minutes of sketched recreations it doesn’t feel like the film stops at all. 

The colorization was the part I wondered the most about. Colorization is such a deadly word in the film community especially after the infamous attempts by Turner in the 90s. But as soon as you see the blood, you get why. There’s a real distancing effects to blood in black and white. Famously the blood Crazy 88 fight in Kill Bill was changed to black and white to avoid an NC-17 rating. But when you see these soldiers with these vicious bloody wounds you really get a sense of immediacy that you never would in black and white. 

There’s some in the film restoration community who despise this film for changing history and to that I say who gave a shit about these films before? Most people I’ve told about this documentary had no idea there even was film footage from the war, despite it being around the same time as The Birth of a Nation and the early Chaplin shorts. But we’ve lost this sense of history of the war which is exactly what Jackson is worried about. I don’t think Jackson views himself as a historian in the same way I don’t think Spielberg viewed himself as one when he made Saving Private Ryan. He’s an entertainer and this film is meant to be immediate and shocking. And besides he didn’t George Lucas it. The originals exists and I imagine have been digitized in their original state. 

There’s a fantastic framing device to this film I just love. It starts with the small frame of soldiers marching and it slowly expands to fill the entire frame. It’s a neat trick but the end really sells the reason for it. The soldiers begin to tell how after the war society rejected them, ignored or didn’t understand their plight. And as they tell this the frame very subtly starts moving away, smaller and smaller. History is being lost right in front of them till it’s just another historical event that we feel removed from. But to Jackson the fight was far too important to be lost to history. Jackson’s film I grantee will become required viewing in many history classes. It will be something that many will view as their initial discovery of the Great War and I think it will in many ways become the definitive view of that war. 

Jackson and his crew deserve a million special Oscars for their work. This is a remarkable way to make people care about something 100 years on. The attention to detail and the attempts to make this look as modern as possible is truly amazing. We’ve all forgotten how costly and awful this war was. This is going to shake a lot of people and for that I give it all the praise I can, as both an artistic and technologic marvel.  ",a5yk8k
ec0xvnr,Really really good... The 30 min Doc with Peter Jackson at the end was the cherry on top. The guy used so much cool stuff to make the best film possible and it really showed. ,a5yk8k

ec0t861,"I took my 13 year old son to watch this with me. He and I both loved it. I highly recommend people see this movie, it's a technical marvel what Peter Jackson has done bringing these 100 year old films to life. The narration during the whole movie was and voice overs were very well done.

We didn't stay for the 30 minute post documentary, for whatever reason the theater was uncomfortable warm. I figured I would catch that when I re-watch it when it comes to streaming.",a5yk8k
ec107vd,"The best way to describe that documentary is *haunting*. It brought a long dead generation vividly back to life to warn us about the costs of war. 

Jackson and his team did an amazing job with the colorization, lip reading, and sound, but there still was a sort of ""uncanny valley"" (for lack of a better term). But it still worked very well and just added a sort of otherworldly effect, like we were looking through a portal. 

If I have one complaint, it's that I wish there were more colorized footage, a lot of it gets recycled several times. But I understand the massive undertaking a single frame is so can't whine too much. 
",a5yk8k
ec14muq,"I think most of all, and what Jackson is trying to highlight here, is the sheer absurdity of war. This is emphasized by the residual psychological trauma clearly vocalized by the narrators combined with the total non-catharsis by the ending of the war. As we heard over and over at the end of the film, the armistice was no cause for celebration. It simply was and they were left feeling as numb as ever, their brains beaten to bits by bombs and guns and shells. 

The ending of the film, when the veterans who were lucky enough to make it back were essentially unemployable societal outcasts, should stick in everyone's mind. There was no desire or means to describe to the greater public the horrors their friends had just endured, the war was seen as a relatively pedestrian affair. Propaganda had succeeded in sugar-coating the largest mass slaughter of all-time. 

In the midst of the documentary one of the narrators tells a story about how he had to put a wounded soldier out of their misery. His voice cracks and he just repeats ""It hurt me."" No way to process, not even modern therapy to help him understand his emotions. Only pain.

If there's anything to be taken away from this, it is to never romanticize war. No one is fighting for your freedom. War is the result of a bunch of old psychos believing they have something to gain, and these creeps would never be a grunt in the front line of any war. Wars are the innocent being made to kill one another. If that doesn't ring true, remember all of the clips of the English talking about how the Germans were people just like themselves, and how they felt bad for them.

echgwbh,"The part where men got stuck in the mud and were left there to drown hit me hard. Imagine being twenty feet from people walking safely on boardwalks while you call out for help only to slowly sink lower and lower until your face goes under and you're swallowed up by darkness. You're still alive, but your lungs begin to burn. You can't move any part of your body in the thick mud. And then your thoughts go to your home, your parents, and you wish you hadn't been so dumb as to sign up since this was the end you were ending up facing.",a5yk8k
ec11f3b,"One line of the movie that was only mentioned once but I think is very interesting was after the war one of the vets talked about how civilians thought that the war was fought with men charging each other with cavalry. 

I’ve read that this is how a lot of soldiers going into WWI thought it would be, sort of a more romantic view of war, only to be thrown into arguably the most brutal conflict ever fought. I never thought about how the civilians may not have realized what really occurred for quite a while post war. ",a5yk8k
ec11zwr,"When PJ talked about how for the first time he finally saw this footage he'd been seeing for literal years, but he actually knew what was said this time, it really put into perspective for me how much of an accomplishment this film was.

Edit- Also, how do I get my hands on those recordings",a5yk8k
ec0wp8r,"One of the veterans narrating the film describes how he had to kill one of his own comrades, because the man was suffering too much.

ec0xq52,"""Where've you been? On nights?"" 

I hope we never forget these globe-spanning, generation-shattering (and defining) conflicts that so shaped the world we live in today-and more importantly, the people that fought in them.

In a medium sized-city, only about a quarter of the theater was filled. The only other small theater that showed the film in the city was fully booked. The only screening available was a 3D one, which wasn't too special, but given that it's unlikely I'll ever get my hands on a 3D version of this film on home media, it was worth the extra money. 

Little needs to be said about the astounding restoration of century-old footage to something that feels very real, limited only by how 'restorable' the source material was. For most audiences at least, the quality and production value and effort speak for themselves. 

The exclusive use of recordings of soldiers to serve as the film's narration is particularly what makes this film so unique for me. Although the soldiers interviewed may have been old when their voices were recorded by the BBC in the 1960s, their sole presence as the voices of this film adds yet another level of immersion and historicity that is provided by the restored footage.

The format of the film as a first-person social history is very effective, and one that I think is rather unique and novel among historical (war) documentaries. I am not referring to the technical aspects here; it would be foolish for one to expect someone to find enough quality audiovisual footage from say, the Civil War and make a documentary about that. The documentaries that I remember watching usually have a mixture of audio and visual re-enactments combined with maybe video interviews of veterans that might cut into a narration over a still photo or film footage. These documentaries are fine, but they cannot quite engage the audience so effectively. Then there are historical biopics, but they are more distant from the historical source and quite often bend or stretch the historical truth in the name of artistic license or entertainment. These are also fine, and entertaining, but can vary in their historical and educational value.

We have lots of contemporary footage and audio interviews from more modern conflicts to hypothetically make a film in the same format, whether it be WWII, or Afghanistan. I think there is something special about this film, however, given how extremely distant the world of WWI was compared to other conflicts where audiovisual footage exists. My grandfather was born near the end of the war-that's how long ago this conflict was! For me, it is the bringing to life of such a distant period of time, through the perspective of soldiers who were there, and restored footage, as opposed say, a reenactment, that makes this film stand out for me compared to other war documentaries. 

I wish this kind of documentary was around when I was a high school history student. It would have made a lot more people interested in studying history, something I firmly believe all of us should have a greater knowledge and awareness of. ",a5yk8k
ec133yq,"I loved Peter Jackson’s little post-documentary documentary at the end. Felt like I was back watching the LOTR appendices again. It’s so fascinating seeing all the hard work from many hands that made this such a masterpiece, and it really makes me appreciate him as a director. 

His appreciation for technical achievement and his down-to-earth style make his work so approachable and endearing. I felt like a kid again wanting to go out and shoot a WWI movie in my backyard.

ec0z7sh,"What an important film. I had to remind myself every couple of minutes that this wasn't an actual movie but these scenes were actually from the battlefield with real people. 

The ending stuck with me for multiple reasons. The transition  showed what the people back home thought of the war: Black and White, sped up, and hard to relate to. The voiceovers recounting how citizens were indifferent to the war was heartbreaking. PJ did a wonderful job and this will be a film that is remembered. Every theater within 20 miles was nearly sold out and mine was filled with people of every age.

efrzc43,"This was an arresting and impressive piece of documentary filmmaking. It's not concerned with the political underpinnings or strategy of WW1 so much as it is with capturing the experience of the soldier in the trenches, and does so quite vividly with a carefully blended use of restored, colorized 100-year-old archival footage from the front, voice-over provided solely via interviews of veterans, and sound effects and voice acting to bring further life to the footage. Apparently this was a big passion project for Peter Jackson, and this really comes through in the attention to detail that putting it all together certainly required.
The total effect is very evocative and leaves a lasting impression - in conjunction with the on-screen imagery, some of which is brutal and graphic, the narrators' descriptions of their enthusiasm for the war effort and the moments of levity they found in their service are as charming as their recollections of the horrifying battlefield violence they survived are harrowing. Strongly recommend to anyone with an interest in the subject matter, in theaters even, given the remarkable quality of the restored footage. ",a5yk8k

edk5jos,"I might be going against the grain here, but I left greatly disappointed by this movie. Here are my 2 cents. Let me first address the quality of the restored footages:  I was initially really amazed when the restored footages kicked in, but there was something that did not feel right, and I couldn’t put my finger on as the movie went on. The restored footages were amazing at first glance but didn’t feel authentic to me. I have watched my share of restored colorized footages in the past, and none of them attempted motion smoothing or video interpolation. It felt out of place when you expect to see footages with defects in them. It is akin watching a cinematic film at 23.97fps on a modern television that tries to smooth its motion to make it look like an NFL football game at 100Hz. The quality of the restoration was also all over the place: some scenes are faithfully restored, but most of them towards the end have that digital smear look to them, as if they over used digital processing all over the picture. You get the same effect if you crank the denoise function all the way up in photoshop. It was really distracting.

Another issue I had with is the spacing of the footage and the narration. The movie doesn’t comprised of 100% restored footages: they mix those footages with still photos, and drawing or cartoons that felt out of place. It is as if they ran of footages and needed fillers between the scenes. I was also disappointed by the lack of information in the narration. I understand ww1 survivors’ testimonies are primordial to this kind of film, but you learn almost nothing about the war. In fact, you are expected to come watch this film knowing full well the events of ww1 and what precipitated it. The POV was strictly British. I wish we could have seen more of the German or French side, their way of life, their POV.

In short: this film might do it if you are just a filthy history casual, but it won’t scratch that itch if you are history buff. A much better documentary I would recommend is [Apocalypse WW1 mini series.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvvE0fvned0&list=PLeVTDqssREGNBD8SUQpmznfUVU9affOGh)

ecq7tat,"I can see this film being a great supplement to the dates and facts heavy books about the war itself. I heard they are giving a copy of this work to every high school history teacher in the UK as an educational supplement.

I remember reading that with the advent of cheap sugar and processed foods, health really declined in the late 19th century. Over 70% of WWI recruits had significant tooth decay, and now I see it in real life. 

I too was disappointed in them not including the Christmas Truce or a real battle, but footage was way more difficult to come by back then. It was a massive ordeal to shoot and process film so you couldn't really have hours of B-Roll or true front line filming.  It made me think about how easily information could be (and was) manipulated by governments to keep the public distanced from the true cost of the war. I don't think they have that luxury of scarcity anymore.",a5yk8k
ec3q29h,"I just watched a scene from end of LOTR and considering that the books were an allegory for WW1, I find it really interesting that Peter Jackson explores something similar to the end of this film before in LOTR. The scene I'm talking about is when the four hobbits return to The Shrine but no one really cares about them and care more about the guy with the big pumpkin. I find it similar to the veterans in They Shall Not Grow Old talking about no one talking about or caring about the war when it ended and that they didn't understand the toll it took on the soldiers. 

Not sure if this scene was included in the books, but if it was an addition by Jackson, I think this is a very nice connection to both LOTR and They Shall Now Grow Old.

ec0tacm,"Caught the first showing of it today despite the packed theater, and I would say I quite liked it. I honestly and surprisingly found the recorded interviews to be about as interesting as the footage itself. The newly added sound effects were probably the most impressive part of the film.

If anyone wishes to know about the quality of the colorisation, I would say it was well done but still obvious. Due to the probable low quality of the original films most of the restored footage had a painted-on look or at times almost CGI-like during rapid movement. Overall though the accomplishment of this much colorised footage was astounding. I will certainly be buying this once it's out on Blu-Ray.",a5yk8k
ec0zrr9,"I was absolutely floored by the film and it is probably the best film I have seen all year (barely beating Paddington 2 and Roma). Surely the best documentary I have seen since Look of Silence. It was absolutely surreal watching these soldiers coming to life. Instead of them feeling like relics of the past, they felt real and as if the war just happened a decade or two ago instead of over a century ago. The restorated footage humanises the soldiers in a whole another level and you can feel as if you are a part of their stories. I also loved that the film had some sort of narrative (which seems nearly impossible considering the amount of footage that exists) which emphasises the grueling conditions the soldiers were in and that shows that they were the biggest losers in the war. That they were used by an elitist, imperial society to achieve nothing. There were some tears when the dude talks about having to kill another Brit to put him out of his misery and I started sobbing at end because of heavy the entire film was. I'm not really sure what the last image of the girls meant though. Truly impressive and imo probably the best document of WW1.

All the people are talking about the visuals and dubbing which are all really impressive but I also think the sound design is brilliant and I have no clue how they made the sound feel so real.

Also I could watch the artillery being fired all day long. ",a5yk8k

ec0utxy,"There's some really potent lines at the end by the soldiers recounting their experience coming back from war that sums up why this is (pardon the cliche expression) essential viewing (paraphrasing a few) ""They think we came back a bit muddy and bit less polite and that was that"" ""Some shops had signs up ex-militarymen need not apply"" ""My mum and dad never felt it was anything that needed to be spoken of, like I'd went on a bit of a holiday and came back"" ""People thought it was just one bad battle but it was living in the trenches day after day, shitting in holes, it was the entire experience"" ""We'd gone off and fought like animals behaved like animals"" If people weren't downright hostile to them they thought that fighting was a single point in time and it was done and over with or they'd try to sympathize but couldn't possibly fathom what the soldiers had gone through. It wasn't just one battle that made them shellshocked. It was living in trenches that flooded while wearing uncomfortable boots that kept the moisture in and gave them [trench foot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_foot). It was seeing lines and lines of dead bodies of friends teeming with flies and maggots. Tanks crushing their fellow dead soldiers' bodies because they didn't have time to clear the bodies away. Lice infestations and going weeks without a shower. These were the norm. Lice was the norm. Rats were the norm. It was the entire experience and lacking any creature comforts these soldiers had been used to growing up. A quick google says 7% of US population are veterans (and 2.5M/66M in UK), no idea how accurate those figures are and don't want to go down the rabbit hole of finding exact figures but suffice it to say it's a very small part of the population that has had a life experience completely different than the other 93% of the population that, it's probably a safe assumption to say has had a profound, lasting effect on them. Watching this movie gives civilians a short, very brief, but (in my civilian opinion) great window into an experience the vast majority of us will never experience even a glimmer of.

I don't mean to shit on it--simply to compare--but I remember watching the No Man's Land scene in Wonder Woman and thinking, okay, but I wish it had been real-er and more gruesome and desolate (yes I realized WW had a hopeful tone and it wouldn't've fit that tone) and the trench scenes in TSNGO is what I was looking for. WW2 overshadows WW1 in terms of atrocities but trench warfare was brutal and miserable and TSNGO gives a great, amazing, first-hand look at it. I'm glad they showed the gruesome images (flies on dead bodies, pale/blue-colored corpses) though I think they held back a fair amount: the voiceovers would be speaking of guts splayed out but they never showed that. Still, it had its effect. I'm all for gruesome and bloodshed but there's a world of difference between watching ER/Grey's Anatomy and watching actual operations or medical training videos of surgeons, no matter how good or how high the props budget. There's a world of difference between watching war movies no matter how good the special effects and seeing an actual dead body. Seeing them strewn everywhere conveys what war is to people who've never and will never fight. We think 'oh that's too bad, shame about those casualties' but to see first-hand images hits you in the gut. Image conveys so much more than reading in a textbook or newspaper ever can.

I was a bit under the weather and thought about skipping, afraid this might be a bit dry and history lesson-y. I'm so glad I went. The movie cites 1M UK causalities from WW1. 2% of the UK population in the 1910s (~43M). 4-5% of the male population (assuming half the population was male). Obviously a higher percentage stripping out children and elder men. Another 1.6M are listed as wounded (casualty + wounded ~12% of male population) and that's to say nothing of mental effects. You can see the UK population rising from the 1850s then just goes slides from [43M to 39.5M](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=11&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwirzty8vKjfAhVLLK0KHXPRCDsQFjAKegQIBhAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ons.gov.uk%2Ffile%3Furi%3D%2Fpeoplepopulationandcommunity%2Fpopulationandmigration%2Fpopulationestimates%2Fadhocs%2F004356ukpopulationestimates1851to2014%2Fukpopulationestimates18512014.xls&usg=AOvVaw0CfO6DslvyWmm4WCFFfAU0) in the 1910s.

It won't, but I'd love to see some technical Oscar noms. The first one that popped into my head early one was sound mixing. Once it gets towards the battles it adds a lot, it makes the experience immersive but doesn't overstep into becoming overbearing, and even the sounds of bombing in the distance when they weren't actively fighting creates an environment of danger even if it's not in the immediate area.

ec0ykz0,"I'd seen several of these clips in the past few weeks but the movie was never really on my radar.

I saw this clip, checked the date, and realized that this was playing at the theater down the street tonight.  

&#x200B;

If you missed it tonight, GO SEE IT  

&#x200B;

It is the closest thing I've experienced to having a time machine and being in the trenches. I watched it in 3D and the theater was sold out so I ended up in the front seats. Usually a deal-breaker, but for this particular movie it served to place me in the frame.

The movie wasn't just incredible on a technical level; I think the last war movie that made me cry was ""Life is Beautiful"", but a really strange thing happened when, in the first few minutes, there are hundreds of cheerful, smiling, *real* people in line for uniforms on the screen, and just feeling that I was among them, and knew their fate before they did.",a5yk8k
ecg4y3p,"I was lucky enough to bag a ticket to the one off showing of Peter Jackson's They Shall Not Grow Old, having watched a lot of World War One documentaries and made countless visits to historic sites across France and Belgium I was keen to see what was being marketed as a 'new' perspective on The Great War, it did not disappoint. Jackson chose to create a narrow focus narrative for this 1 hour 30 minute documentary to allow the viewer to delve into the fine details often missed in more sweeping documentaries trying to cover all aspects and areas of the conflict. Jackson chose to look closely at the lives and experiences of British native frontline troops in Belgium. The documentary follows a linear timeline beginning with the breakout of war and the initial volunteering of thousands of young men excited and ready for an adventure for King and Country and ends with the great sense of loss and uncertainty of the future the troops had by the end of the war. The entire documentary is narrated by records of surviving troops recorded in the 60s and 70s, this was an intentional move by Jackson that definitely adds to the ability for the viewer to connect and relate to the survivors. I especially found the stories and anecdotes about the goings on behind the lines during down time and R&R for the troops captivating as it is often over looked in other documentaries solely concentrating on the combat and horrors of war. The pain staking effort and lengths Jackson and his team went to to restore this footage not only with colour but with frame rate, sharpness and especially sound is breath taking. Taking the time to have professional lip readers painstakingly review all the footage so allow us to then know and hear what was being said truly brought the footage to life. My only issue with the film, something that is made note of by Jackson is of course because of the time in history and available cameras there is no actual combat footage available so you do spend a large amount of time just watching still hand drawn cartoons of the battles from the time, something that cannot be avoided but does detract from the immersion the rest of the film creates. I highly recommend this film to everyone, it is important we see the true perspective of what our ancestors went through and never forget these brave men and women.",a5yk8k
efrmnfb,"This was a great documentary I'm really glad I saw in the theater. Obviously the limitations of the original footage (which Jackson mentions in the post-credits making-of- nobody would have been crazy enough to actually assault the German trench carrying a camera) means it isn't as full and visually interesting as some may have liked, but the footage we do get is still amazing, both in what we see (the mines exploding in particular is a highlight, as /u/pierrebrassau points out) and how well it looked- at times you could have told me it was real color footage taken with super-experimental film at the time and I'd have believed you. I was also impressed with the sound- amazing how well they match the lips. 

My biggest disappointment is probably how it was so focused on the land war. While I definitely understand how following the average British soldier tells a more universal story (as Jackson says in the making-of, the experience of British soldiers in the trenches were pretty similar to most other countries), I wish we could have seen some of the stuff on the aviators and sailors, especially as Jackson shows some of that (restored but not colorized) in the making-of. Maybe he'll come back one of these years...

My dad was able to get a photo book of our Irish family colorized and it makes everyone look so much happier. It brought out the beautiful countryside we knew and visited rather than some bleak background. I'm glad WWI also go it's revival on the 100th anniversary.

I understand that there's a limit on what you can do with available footage, but that whole sequence just seemed incredibly long.

But from a filmgoing standpoint, I have issues with the editing and narrative. Mainly that the entire 100 minute runtime is absolutely PACKED with narrative and interviews with no more than a couple seconds break in between. I personally felt this became distracting when I really wanted to take a breather from dialogue and really just take in the sound, music and visuals and get lost in the experience.

I will say this though....avoid the 3D screenings if you can.  The showing we went to last night was 3D and it really was a detriment to the film.  2D is really the way this needs to be seen.  There was not one point in the movie where I felt like anything was added by it.  

Outside of that, I do wish there was some footage of the actual fighting as much of what we get is pre or post fighting.  I understand why it's not in there and they did a great job storyboarding it out using actual drawings from back then.  At the end of the movie, I found myself wanting more.  I want to see the different units and more of how they lived back then.  What they were able to do with this old 100 year old footage was breathtaking.

But I felt like the true brutality of the war was downplayed.  It started and ended on weirdly high notes.  In the post-credits doc, Jackson mentions how they came to choose the credits song, and says something along the lines of, ""There are much more vulgar lines in this song, but we decided to keep the cleaner verses instead.

Loved the film. The terror you saw on some of their faces was rough. The scenes with the flies on the dead bodies in particular stood out.

It was obvious many of them were dealing with serious PTSD (can you blame them?). And knowing that not only did virtually all of them die without receiving any help with it, but they had to deal with downright ignorance from society as a whole to the struggles they dealt with. My dad has PTSD from a few tours in the Middle East, things like sharp thunder or fireworks can bring on panic attacks even so many years later. Thankfully we live in a time where it’s taken seriously by most people and treated well. They not only dealt with things most soldiers today couldn’t even imagine, they also lived in a time where any form of weakness shown after the war made them into essentially invalids and stripped them of any masculinity in the eyes of the public.

The film begins with basic training footage, in black and white, building to the moment when the soldiers go to the Western Front. That’s when the movie transitions into startling color. Was Jackson going for a dramatic, “Wizard of Oz”-style effect? Well, not exactly.

“It was all to do with the budget,” he said. Originally the documentary was to be about half an hour long. “The budget we had was to colorize about 30 to 40 minutes of film.” But as he and his team listened to the interviews, what the veterans said about training provided much-needed context, and the filmmakers didn’t want their movie to “jump straight into the trenches.” Still, the budget wasn’t flexible.

This was a unique take on WWI, full of invaluable knowledge and experience.  In fact it is what academic films always miss, the humanity.   Seeing the faces of the youth, experiencing the sudden chaos that is war.  This was always lost in the grainy footage of ""history buff"" verified films.  You felt the dread, the despair, the hope; everything.   In short it was a masterclass presentation of humanity, which literally and figuratively added color to an experience that was previously obscure and too academic.

ee9003k,"I think showing it only from the British was because Jackson wanted to give the viewers an idea of what the war experience was like (the whole package including the down time) from the perspective of the soldiers, who didn't always know completely what was going on or why. It wasn't a documentary about the war on a broad scale, it was about the personal experience of surviving and experiencing it. Despite not being a 'filthy history casual' I think you've missed the point entirely. In promotional interviews for the documentary Peter Jackson entusiastically talks about the faces being the most exiting part of the restoration and he talks about how he wanted to make the footage appear more natural because it's easier to detach ourselves from the footage when it's silent and unnaturally sped up. Likewise it's easier to detach ourselves from the experience of being in the war when talking about the events and battles of the war at that broader scale. Now there is a place for documentaries about the war at a broader scale but that's what most WW1 documentaries are already like. This one was unique because it shows a perspective of the war that has never been seen with so much clarity before. As for why only the British pov was shown, this experience would feel diluted if it was jumping to different places and different nation's forces (the other reason is that Jackson is an English speaker and it is dedicated to his Grandfather who was in the British army during WW1). The documentary felt more personal because most of the narrators were the same group of people and the footage was edited and chosen so that it felt like it was all from one frontline from one battle. The narrators could have been from totally different places at different times of the war but it is edited this way to give it some cohesion and keep it simple because the important part is what day to day life was like in the war.  It's meant to be the personal experience of a group of people from the start to the end of the war with a little piece of everything from that experience. It's a conscious decision to not talk about the location or the mission in the broader context of the war because the soldiers themselves didn't always know much either and sometimes didn't even care. They didn't even know where they were in the country they were sent to and didn't even know what country they were going to until the day they left. I feel like the frontline experience from the German's or French would be similar in a lot of ways (but not all) and this was touched on when they were talking about both sides perception of the wastefulness of war. The problem posed by using that perspective, other than diluting the experience that was shown from the perspective of a small group of people, is the language barrier. ",a5yk8k

And I think he's right there: the book is not ""an allegory"" for either WW1 or WW2, but I think you are right that the story nonetheless has small elements inspired by the wars, which is only natural being written by a man who fought in the first world war and saw all his friends die during that period.

egte063,"There's an interview at the end with Peter Jackson that directly addresses those concerns. There was no footage of charges into No Man's Land because it was simply too dangerous for a camera crew to set up and take footage. So that's why they used the artwork. That artwork came from a weekly magazine depicting the war by sketch artists, so it's contemporary to the battles.

This film was commissioned by a British organization, so that's whose archival film he had the most access to. Concerning the British perspective, Jackson said he could have told a ton of different stories (different nationalities like French, Germans, Russians, Italians, and Americans; women in the industrial war efforts; medical efforts; etc.), but his goal was to tell the average perspective of a soldier's life on the Western front. Thus, he believes the story was generally applicable to all soldiers fighting in the Western trenches, regardless of nationality.

They did a magnificent job restoring the footage in general -- to make it 3D on top of that really pulled you into the story. Highly recommend seeing this in 3D.
2. Well, you get a glimpse of what the war was truly like. You see what the medical condition ""trench foot"" looks like. You see the flies, mice, and everything else that surrounds the dead. I didn't find it gory like Logan, Kill Bill or movies like that, yet the death you see in this movie is not just part of a story. It actually happened. As a result, I think it's a bit more disturbing than your typical movie.

ec1nw57,Have to disagree. The 3D added DEPTH. They didn't have things flying at you.  There are many shots of men sitting together in a crowd and you really felt up close and with them.

ec1urkd,"At the end of the credits Jackson explained that with camera technology being so bulky and new at the time, actual footage of fighting is almost non-existent.

ec49h5y,"I have to agree on the 3D. It added nothing to the documentary. 

The theater I went to has a different kind of 3D projector than most theaters and have special glasses that have very slim lenses. Most of the auditorium was marked off as reserved so I ended up in the 3rd row. Terrible experience. The glasses kept causing a rainbow effect on the image and sections to become blurred out because of how close I was and slim the lenses were. I kept having to rotate my head trying to see everything through the glasses. I finally got annoyed and just watched it with the glasses off. I really do love 3D and sitting closer to the screen but they shouldn't allow people to sit that close when the movie is in 3D because it messes with the image.

They didn't shy away from showing limbs blown off, bloodied corpses, trench foot and infections so bad that body parts are falling off, men shell shocked and describing their horrible living conditions and lack of adequate food, water, clothing and shelter. 

What I do agree with is the high note at the end. It seemed that even after all of this horror that we were just shown, the filmakers wanted us to feel cozy and right at home with these soldiers in comfortable conditions that they had spent years away from. It honestly made me feel weird, which may have been intentional. Our discomfort with the amount of normality at the end could be reflective of what the soldiers felt upon returning to a stable environment after years of a hell.

I think the reason Jackson didnt have too vulgar of a version was simply because it'd clash with the aesthetic of the film. Like if it started being a song about pussies and ass, it'd be kind of, clashing with the atmosphere. Yes there is violence but it was more of a, noble violence in a way.

Peter Jackson has a passion for WWI that he should run with for a while. Imagine the stories and footage we could see from different angles. I've seen more interest in WWI from this film than any other WWI centennial effort in the last five years.

Maybe when he gets more of those out there he can turn his attention to WWI. I would welcome similar levels of effort to help bring history alive. We used to have WWII veterans that people were related to that would pique interest in a certain percentage of the population that otherwise wouldn't be, but the majority have died off and there are fewer people these days who had a relative who survived war and can speak to the horrors and affects.

ec10gmx,Literally saw the 2D version tonight.,a5yk8k
ec10cbr,That's not true at all,a5yk8k
ec82c6t,So there *is* after credit scenes? Info at top states there isn’t. ,a5yk8k
ec29jsu,"Yeah what they used makes sense given the context, but it still just felt like it dragged on. It made it hard to visualize.",a5yk8k
ehfd22i,Good response. It is important to recognize the limitations that constrained him in this venture. Keep in mind that his success opens up the landscape for future generations to do similar creative remastering with a different focus. ,a5yk8k
ho9sl3t,"""regardless of nationality"": but this is the exact criticism: there is no other nationality in this story. I loved the film but i do agree that getting french, German etc would make this so much more rich. This reply just totally ignores that dimension",a5yk8k
ejbq2bp,The movie would've been better with an added German perspective. Maybe there will be a sequel which hopefully covers the German perspective (which i think most would find more interesting).,a5yk8k
ec2ztzn,"Some of the ones about finding men stuck in the mud, then coming back later and seeing only a head?

I definitely remembered that one.",a5yk8k
ec1v5do,Awesome. My only showing is at 1pm and 4pm out here and I usually don't finish work until 6pm :(,a5yk8k
eeph453,"Thanks, I was going to come back to say that. Just saw it last night. I have to admit I nodded off a few times. Not because the quality of the film is poor. But a lot of it was like listening to my demented grandfather drone on. I really wish they had done half the movie as a focus on the British troops, as they did, but then touched on all of the other interesting aspects of the war that he mentioned in that after-credits making-of segment.",a5yk8k
ec2cr1g,Is there any narrative in it? ,a5yk8k
ec49ipd,All 3D really did was distort the image.  It was never made with 3D in mind and honestly I felt like it ruined a few moments of the film by making backgrounds and such blurry just so the soldiers in the foreground would feel closer.  ,a5yk8k
ec1tbos,"> He wagered if the camera men back then were given the choice between the two,they would have opted for the color film. I'd tend to believe that's true. 

Agree 100%",a5yk8k
ec1q8nr,"Hmmm. I just remember my grandfather being a collector of WWII documentaries who would get a kick out of this, but outside of the Ken Burns version I think they are all in black and white.",a5yk8k
ec135t8,I think the close-ups of trench foot were what disturbed me the most honestly ,a5yk8k
ec1i9vj,"I definitely don’t think it was boring but it definitely did feel a bit directionless to me as well. Jackson even says at the end that they kind of went as they went and that definitely showed in the documentary imo 

I still enjoyed it but I get what the commenter is trying to say. There was loads of effort in the colorization and voiceovers and sounds but the story board just was not up to par. ",a5yk8k
ec1jru1,"I think I judge documentaries on 3 things. The story it's telling, new information I found out and how entertained I was. 

Instead of telling A story they cut up a hundred and glued them together. I just don't think that a hundred stories are as compelling as one. Also, didn't like how much repetition there was. There were 3 or so minutes of interesting horror-of-war stuff but spread over 90 minutes it wasn't enough.

Barely anything on the information front. Just generic war. Found out 3 little things, already forgot one of them, must not have been that interesting.

As a result I wasn't really entertained. I was mildly bored, zoning in and out, waiting for it to finally kick in. ",a5yk8k

efs0yzg,"""The stench of death was everywhere, but you just kind of got used to it since complaining about it wouldn't change anything, eh old boy?"" ",a5yk8k
ec0zxuk,"The entire theatre died at that. Jackson you WWI-obsessed man, we love you",a5yk8k
ec0uhyp,Who *doesn't* have vintage WW1 uniforms & artillery hanging around their basement?,a5yk8k
ec469s8,"Yeah man, and that shot of trench foot was pretty nasty.",a5yk8k
ec1ryc3,"It wasn't that bad though. I've seen worse in PG-13 movies. Probably just because its, well... actual dead people.",a5yk8k
ec1yeq9,Nice,a5yk8k
efkebu2,"we watched the boy in stripped pajamas...

everyone tried to hard to hide their tears.

i tried and probably failed. that movie was heartcrushingly sad. ",a5yk8k
eg7p8ba,"Maybe kids in 30 years will be able to watch Schindler's List, restored and colorized by Peter Jackson",a5yk8k
ec15qa3,"Yeah exactly, he was saying he’d love it if this gained enough traction to make *more* documentaries in the same vein about the soldiers from other countries involved in the war. Seeing and hearing their personal stories too.

I agree that it was much more poignant due to the personal nature on the focus on one “group” so to speak. I would just love to get more content like this in general, it was so moving to watch.",a5yk8k
ec1jc2e,"Yes I watched the ending too. That’s my point; have him do another one with a different focus. Make it like a series. There’s so much out there! If this one is focused on brits, then pick another group for the second one. ",a5yk8k
ec78nu9,"Also the form of restoration would've had to be have been different and it wouldn't have gelled with the themes here.

They were able to use correct regional accents for the VO for the British Tommies because of how they were recruited (pals battalions), and the fact the badges on their uniforms showed what part of the country they were from.

You wouldn't really be able to get that with the other nations.

I recommend anyone interesting in the pals battalions and how it affected the small rural areas they were recruited from check out *The Village* (1993 British television drama).",a5yk8k
ec1j8gk,No that’s what I meant. Have him do another. Make it a series!,a5yk8k
ec53waa,"That'd be great, too!!
",a5yk8k
eeo9j7y,it was after the credits,a5yk8k
ec1y7e0,"Chil bro.  I am fine with the documentary, but many of us took other people (older family members) who didn't have all the context around it.  The 2nd half of my comment pretty much covers whatever you got upset about.  Jeez.",a5yk8k
eg7pjki,"One of my favorite lip readings was the officer giving his dudes a pep talk. When I was watching the movie, I thought there was no way that a lip reader could figure out half the words this guy was saying-- his mouth was hard to make out and sometimes barely moving. I thought they were making up most of the words to fill in the blanks. But apparently Peter Jackson & Friends went through his regiments record until they found a memo from the day the footage was recorded. They realized that the words that they *could* make out lined up perfectly with the document they had.",a5yk8k
ec11muz,WWI has been a massive interest of him for his whole life. How cool is it that he got to pour his best effort into something like this. I’m very happy for him ,a5yk8k
ec11aoq,"> I didn't know Peter Jackson was such a historian.

Oh he totally is. You check out the documentary he did back in '95. It's incredible. https://youtu.be/bt-DQc9LjpU",a5yk8k
ec29yf9,"The theater I was in laughed a couple of times over how he was just able to pull out uniforms and equipment during production.

Also, for what it's worth, Peter Jackson started a very well regarded [plastic model kit company](http://www.wingnutwings.com/ww/) a number of years ago that until recently focused exclusively on WWI aircraft. It's one of the few where you can see a passion for the product top-down at all levels - even the instructions booklets are rife with information and history.
",a5yk8k
ec18k2j,Sweaty seats for the next person!,a5yk8k
efkelsj,"guys... please... i can only be so sad after watching this.

seriously though. beautiful film. and you guys are totally right about society failing those men by

1. sending them to war
2. shaming them if they couldnt go
3. completely ignoring their pain when they returned. ",a5yk8k
ec1uami,*Dated* geo-political squabbles. The war was the result of a chain reaction of retaliations based on treaties and alliances that were irrelevant until it came to slaughtering each other.,a5yk8k
ec24i44,"The end of the war saw a number of new states gain their independence from collapsed empires, including my own. This was an aftereffect with no connection to the causes of the war, but you should really realize that the ""geopolitical squabbles"" of great powers can be of crucial importance to smaller nations. The war of independence we had following WWI was not pointless.",a5yk8k

eer2puh,[deleted],a5yk8k
efn2oni,Ya I saw it after this comment. I more agree with you after seeing it. Definitely toralable on that side. ,a5yk8k
ec6p336,just throwing my two cents in--I expected way more shocking gore based on comments. I guess it just kinda varies on your temperament and how sensitive you are to it. The worst visual scene imo was >!the picture of trench foot!< ,a5yk8k
ec5kz4u,"I have a queasy stomach and I had to look away and think about something else for a bit. It's pretty visceral. I know it had to be shown, but damn some of those images are haunting",a5yk8k

eeqhoor,Was fine. It's not in your face. The 3d adds depth. ,a5yk8k

ec10ruo,Fair enough! I'm sorry.,a5yk8k

ec2jk89,"I've seen locations adding times, definitely keep checking",a5yk8k
ec2fimb,Yes. There's narration from old recordings of soldiers restored over the movie,a5yk8k
ec4bwxs,I say it was well done given what they had to work with. ,a5yk8k
ec22cod,That was frostbite I believe. Still nasty.,a5yk8k
ec1l7x8,"Those are fair points. A single story may have been a bit difficult to pull off with how they were approaching the footage.  Maybe sticking with voice over from fewer narrators with more from them rather than the sound bites would have given more of a compelling narrative. I got the impression that they were trying to show the significant number of men who had a story to tell while showing the massive amount of footage that depicted similar instances of their experiences that most of the men could relate to.

I agree, the information was lacking, but hopefully those with little knowledge of the war will find themselves intrigued enough to seek out a bit more.  I expect people will have felt they have had an experience rather then learned about the specific events. Seeing what the trench warfare, they have all likely heard of, was really like may be enough to translate the way the Great war, and all wars, truely are.",a5yk8k
ec14ne6,'that's how I got my bout of dysentery'.,a5yk8k
ec106bh,"That and the magazine collection. For those who didn't see, he used magazine depictions of violence because they didn't have footage of the actual close combat fighting. He thought he had maybe 20-30 of these magazines. They checked and he had the entire set of around 200. ",a5yk8k

ec6vxii,"Machine guns, flamethrowers, trench shotguns, mustard gas, drum fire artillery barrages that last for days, tanks...

Yeah, the war changed greatly over just a few years. I think one of the lines in the film was that a soldier from 1914 and 1918 wouldn't even be able to recognize it as the same war. ",a5yk8k
ec61841,"They knew what machine guns were, or at least they were introduced to them in training. It's just that nobody thought about what it would be like when machine guns were everywhere, firing all the time.

ec1822g,Watch Paddington first. You won't feel as emotionally attached to the second movie without watching the first. The entire motivation for the actions of Paddington is based on his relationship to a character from the first film. The relationship was mostly explored in the first film. ,a5yk8k
