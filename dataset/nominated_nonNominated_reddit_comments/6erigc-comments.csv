dicjgyg,"This is the DC movie I've wanted since The Dark Knight.

It is by no means perfect; but it hits *bullseyes* on what it needs to hit. Amazing action scenes (the whole of the No Man's Land scene), the relate-able and consistent characters, and, most of all, the excellent adaptation of Wonder Woman (backstory, flaws, growth and all)! 

On that last point, I wanna expand - major props to the movie for actually defining our character's values, challenging them and watching them grow as a result. It forms the base for a good story and this one is solid.

I can't type much more; but, I am ridiculously pleased, excellently done DC, from one hell of a fan.

*Edit:*

To add a little more - the No Man's Land scene is a *wonderful* microcosm of awesome action and character heart. For days WW has been strung along with the promise of saving lives, and after passing by hundreds who *need* help she can't take it anymore and *charges* into action. Wise, maybe not; but that reckless nature is a defining characteristic of Wonder Woman and this scene *nails* it. (As an aside, that may be what is so frustrating about Superman in MoS, and BvS: he seems *reluctant* to even *be* Superman. Yes, a core piece of his identity is to grapple with that question, but two movies in and he is still stuck in season 10 of Smallville.)

Also, holy *shit* the action of that scene is amazing. The shield scene in the fields is beautiful; but the combat-style of Diana inside the buildings is *perfect*! In much the same way that Faora annihilated soldiers in MoS, or Batman hammered through goons in the warehouse scene this No Man's Land scene defines Wonder Woman's combat style as unique, deadly and really freaking cool! Major props there!

I admit, I am a DC-leaning fan (see username), and I am fresh out of the theater in a euphoric high; but this movie may have edged into my Top 5 favorite Comic Book/Superhero movies list (TDK, IM1, GotG1, Spiderman 2) - I liked it that much.

[Every other part that depicted the gods was very neo-classical or at least an attempt at it, David Thewlis however looks like he is about to go on a safari hunt. I can see him staying in that form to blend into British culture but it who in their right mind thought Nigel Thornberry should be the real form of Ares?] (#spoiler)",6erigc
divkmcd,"So I just rewatched the movie and here are some things I noticed:

* the parallel between steve telling diana “i gotta go” the First time, immediately after she has her crisis moment of “they don’t deserve help” and all she does is shake her head at him and pull back while he runs // the Second time, immediately before he goes to fly the plane, and her response is, rather than shaking her head, an impassioned “whatever it is, I can do it!” whilst grabbing his hands.
* the moment immediately before that where she’s lying on the ground thrown back by the explosion and steve’s face & his bright eyes appear in the screen above her as a direct parallel to the scene where she found him on the beach at the beginning.
* the rest of the squad – sammy, charlie, and chief – were all “fighting their own battles”, like sameer says in that one point. but what i found really heartwarming was the realization that each of them had a sort of mini-victory against the thing they were struggling with; charlie when he realized through diana’s “but who will sing for us?” that he was so much more than his mental illness; sammy in the opportunity he had to crank up the Acting ^(TM) to 20 and use that skill to help their heroic mission; and chief in his use of traditional smoke signals to let diana and steve know where ludendorff was. they were very, very small victories, but victories none the less.

Now for some more general thoughts.

I think the most iconic thing about Wonder Woman is that she never has to prove herself as a woman, only as a warrior. Like this is a movie set during a point in time where (most, if not all) women couldn’t even vote and yet whenever she’s fighting there are no comments on her gender. She doesn’t have to seduce men and they don’t underestimate her-they just see her as something to shoot at. The fact that she’s a better fighter than Chris Pine doesn’t emasculate him like it would in any other movie, it’s a logical fact. Wonder Woman worked because it wasn’t trying so goddamn hard to convince you that a girl was worthy of fighting with the guys-it took that as fact and worked from there. And as a result, Diana got to experience such a complex and moving character evolution-optimism, doubt, a crisis of morality, and the development of a new, evolved worldview-that is incredibly rare if not unheard of in any movie with a female protagonist, let alone one in an action movie. Wonder Woman is this iconic feminist figure but the movie wasn’t selling store brand pseudo empowering “girl power,” it was a hero’s journey, a film about loss and doubt and growth whose hero just happened to female, and as a result it was one of the most complex, resonant arguments for female personhood that I’ve ever seen on screen.

One of the things I loved the most about Steve and Diana’s love story was that even though it was unconventional in its arc and ending (in that it didn’t follow the usual pattern or meet the usual goals of a fictional love story), it never sneered at those conventions. due to their circumstances- she’s a goddess, he’s a mortal, they’re in the middle of a war- and the fact that they are called to heroism and sacrifice, their story can’t end conventionally or domestically. but the beautiful thing about it is that the movie does not use its own heroic status to look down at love stories that do end traditionally and simply. even more beautifully, both steve and diana wish that it could.

Steve quips at the beginning about how no, married couples usually don’t love and cherish each other ‘til death do they part. he’s cynical about a lot and that includes love and marriage. diana was brought up on an all-female island. her goals and ambitions, her purpose in life are different from most women around her. from the start it’s clear that their love story was never going to end quietly and conventionally, not least because the story in which both of them live does not explicitly deal with the themes of love and marriage. diana begins her journey ready to fulfill her sacred mission and duty, and through meeting her and learning from her, steve also rises to great heights. both perform heroic feats and acts of self-sacrifice. they are heroes and heroes are not ordinary people. 

But the reason that wonder woman succeeds so spectacularly and rises above many of its counterparts (to me at least) is that it acknowledges that heroes should only exist to protect the lives of ordinary people. it believes that it is the sacred duty of heroes to fight evil on the grandest scale precisely so that everyone else can continue to live quietly, peacefully, domestically. convention, tradition, even routine are not dismissed or belittled. they are raised up. they are cherished and fought for as the very things that make life living. wonder woman is about war, but it is not about war with no cause. it is about the only thing that ever makes a war justified. 

And when steve and diana are dancing in the snow and diana asks “is this what people do when there are no wars?” she’s asking it because she never forgets that she’s fighting for more (so much more) than her own glory or even just to defeat evil. she’s fighting for the preservation of peace, of ordinary people’s right to dance together in the snow without danger, to eat breakfast, go to work, raise children, live their ordinary lives without fear. and when steve hands her his watch at the end and says “i wish we had more time” he’s saying he wishes that they had time to build a whole life together, a whole life of beautiful peaceful ordinariness. steve and diana’s love story is tragic because it’s cut short before the rest of it can unfold, but it’s beautiful because, in sacrificing a future that neither can have but both want, they are making possible the flourishing of a hundred other love stories, of a thousand other peaceful, ordinary lives. and both believe that that is worth every sacrifice.",6erigc

difytwb,"What surprised me the most, and the thing that really made the film for me (quite unexpectedly so) was the CHEMISTRY Chris Pine and Gal Gadot had. I know Gal is the central character of the movie, but I really want to applaud Chris too. I feel like in a lot of the interviews even, that he is often overlooked as questions are directed more to Gal and Patty. But he's also half the reason why the relationship between Steve and Diana came off to be as so authentic and genuine - I absolutely loved them together, and that isn't something I say often when it comes to human-superhero love stories. I loved how they navigated through each of their worlds together, and their scenes didn't feel cheesy or corny. Originally thought Pine's character would be too much like a ""guide"" for Wonder Woman, but he was so much more. He held his own.

Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. Yes, there were moments where I felt like it dragged on for a bit (but only just a bit), but the other (quite fantastic) moments bounced the movie right back up for me. Yes, there were a lot of CG involved but that was to be expected (and honestly, the trailer that came before this movie was Transformers so...).

dimtn0h,"With regards to some of the non-Ares-centred complaints I've heard about the ending, namely that the love interest (Steve) sacrificing himself is what prompts Diana to ~~go Super Saiyan on Ares~~ become enraged and how ""profoundly anti-feminist"" (to quote the /Filmcast's David Chen) that is, I see how people are coming to that conclusion but I simply do not agree.

I think people are forgetting the conversation Steve and Diana have immediately before the big battle with Ares, in which he basically admits to her that humans are extremely flawed and possibly even inherently warlike, and tries to convince her that humanity is worth saving even if humans aren't perfect. For him to say that and then do the most selfless thing possible spoke volumes to me and I think that was what the movie was going for.

Steve is obviously a good guy but he doesn't always do what Diana would consider to be the right thing, and in fact the film goes out of its way to set up him trying to *stop her* from doing the right thing several times. Him being an imperfect man but, with his dying moments, making the most difficult but ultimately beneficial choice is what prompted her outburst of emotion IMO - and it's what ultimately prompts her to reject Ares' low opinion of humanity.",6erigc
dichkfc,"I absolutely loved this movie. It felt like a clasic throwback to the 70's. I came out of the movie loving the title character which I think its the most important aspect of this film, and I think theres a lot of great messages within the film.
I think its great for little girls(and boys) to finally have a powerful female superhero they can admire and look up to.
I also felt the humor was handled super well in this movie. It added a lot of humanity and charm to the film overall.


I dont think the movie is perfect by any means, and it definitely suffers a little in the 3rd act, but the main character, Gadot specially, and the very last moments between her and Pine make it all worth it IMO. In the end, it celebrated Wonder Woman and what she stands for, a true superhero.

didjswc,"I'm rarely moved by big tentpole movies these days, but Wonder Woman managed to bring a tear to my eye on several occasions. The earnestness has been praised, and I'll add my voice to that praise. Such a refreshing lack of seeking shelter in irony. Maybe it was that kind of old-fashioned blockbuster spirit that also moved me - a pic that wants to entertain without being condescending or overly self-conscious.

But I also found it surprisingly thoughtful in parts, without sacrificing the comic booky action parts. Best of both worlds, I'd say! In fact, I thought the final showdown was the possibly the best I've seen in any superhero movie. It wasn't just visually epic, it was emotionally perhaps even more epic, all the while being, in a very good way, comic booky and thus fantastic.

Wow. I'm still kind of overwhelmed (got out of a screening about an hour ago). I'm just glad I lived to see a beyond epic Wonder Woman movie. Props to Patty Jenkins - you knocked it out of the ballpark!",6erigc

dir1r5u,"With all the glowing reviews I was kind of expecting a better movie, to be honest. 

Like, it wasn't bad which is already saying a lot for a DC film, but even when he's not in the director's seat, it was still chock full of the same type of dubious cinematographic choices Zack Synder relies on so much in his movies in this new DC cinematic universe.

Gal Godot played a great Wonder Woman, everything before Chris Pine was spot on but even then you can already tell there's going to be a worrying amount of 300-esque slow down in fight scenes, and Chris Pine himself when he first showed was a gem in near every scene he was in. I really liked how in the Chris only scenes it was like you were watching an entirely different movie before Diana would come crashing into it like...well, like an ancient idealistic sword and shield welding warrior princess. That both of them had to at some point realize they weren't starring in the genre of movie they thought they were was probably my favorite extended piece of the movie.

On the flip side, the main villain was forgettable and somehow ended up more forgettable as he hammed it up, the above mentioned reliance on slow down in all the fight scenes, the camera choices in a lot of places (why do so many people speak directly to the camera, in the middle of the screen? I thought everyone realized this was a bad idea after the Les Mis movie), and sometimes I don't think the movie knew how to best transition from one completed scene to the next and as such the fight scenes and story scenes don't go from one to the other quite well. And some of the music choices were...bizarre. Why does Wonder Woman's action theme sound like a heavy electronic psuedo-Bond theme? In a movie set in WWI starring a legend out of Greek myth?

In terms of DC movies, I guess I'd rank it somewhere around RED 2, maybe a bit below. I certainly enjoyed watching it, it was worth the ticket price, and I'd certainly consider seeing a sequel, but I don't think I'd ever rewatch it if it were on television.",6erigc

dicoyco,"I went to see it on Wednesday, and to be honest, I was a little skeptic towards all the hype, so I was trying to keep my expectations reasonable. And I was very pleasantly surprised.

The first act, on Themiscyra, is gorgeous. The fighting of Amazons was done pretty well, too. I also really liked the interactions between Steve and Diana during this part (well, during the whole movie, really).

The second act was my favorite, Diana was amazing. Both in regards to fun and action scenes. That battleground / Veld fight scene was fantastic, a truly great moment. Steve and Diana had great chemistry, again, they really nailed both the casting and the writing for these roles. The supporting characters were quite fun, too.

The third act was my least favorite, but mainly because I didn't like any of the villains, but it wasn't that bad. I like that Steve died because of his sacrifice, that he wasn't killed.

All-around, it was a great movie - not a cinematic masterpiece, but certainly an amazing blockbuster. I think the hype is deserved and I hope that the movie does very well in the BO.",6erigc
dicgywb,"I think Steve Trevor is the most noble and heroic character in comic book movie history. I really enjoyed Chris Pine's performance in this movie and honestly, it's a shame he won't have a consistent role in the DC Cinematic Universe. 

The No Man Land's scene was really well done. The build up, the tension and the pay off really left an impression with me. I also really enjoyed the Sameer, Charlie and Chief. Their friendship and comrade really felt real and i applaud all involved in bringing that out.

Also, despite being a 'family friendly' movie and having a lighter tone. I like that the film still felt more grown up and didn't feel out of place in the DC universe. You may not like the tone of the previous films, but you can't just do a 180 and change everything within one film.
 
I didn't really like the final Ares battle. I feel like the writers felt compelled to add it into the movie when instead i think the most powerful moment in the movie was just before the Ares reveal and battle. Diana looking out and seeing man still fighting despite believing she had killed Ares was amazing and the conversation that followed with Steve and Diana was emotional and a good reason for Diana to turn away from humanity. Instead, we get an uneeded boss battle and more dodgy CGI. 

Overall, i enjoyed the film and it gives me hope for the Aquaman solo film and other future projects, despite me liking Man of Steel and BvS. 7.5/10 ",6erigc
dicgueh,"Let's call a spade a spade here. This is a solid movie. The images of female empowerment, the action direction, the way Wonder Woman is played as an innocent and morally strong beacon of hope. It all turned out so well when it could have seemed so pandering or just plain bad. Next to BvS this is practically Citizen Kane.

There were a few things I didn't care for. Some of the humor didn't land for me. And I thought it was too long. Having a final action set piece that lasted, what, like 25 minutes where she fights two different bosses seemed a bit much. The third act in itself was a bit too ""Okay this is a super hero movie so we have to do these things"" to me. The first two Acts were great. It's a heavy movie about war, the corruption of man, etc. So I was a bit disappointed when it turned into more of a comic book movie at the end. All worth it though for the No Man's Land scene. Seriously an amazing sequence for so many reasons. 

I'm glad this movie is good. All I want is good movies, I don't want to shit on DC, I just want to see good movies with the characters I like. This was a huge step in the right direction. 

Edit: tbh I thought a really neat ending would be no Ares. She kills German man and war still rages, she realizes man is at fault. I understand why they felt they needed an Ares fight but still .",6erigc

dietcfc,"Good movie. One of the most fascinating about it is the thematic elements it took on in regards to the good vs evil nature of humanity. I'm starting to see the grand plans of DCEU, and what sets them apart from Marvel. They want to tell stories of Gods and Men, and the stories they tell are approaching mythical status, and deals with the strengths and short comings of these gods and how humanity accepts and rejects them. These films aren't meant to be grounded like Marvel. They are elevated to a much more abstract level, and want to raise heavy philosophical questions. These films are DCEU's modern Greek tragedies. 

I love how each film focuses on a different aspect of this pondering of humanity, and how each of the major character, the ""holy trinity"" (Batman, Superman, and Wonderwoman) deal with it differently in their own way. In Man of Steel and BvS, Superman experienced the doubt humanity has of his good deeds. He learned that no matter how well intentioned, there is so much uncertainty in the world that his simple good deeds can be viewed dubiously by the very people that he tries to save. He saw that humanity problems aren't black and white, and there may be no such thing as absolute good. Batman tried to do good, but for the years he put in, all the got was the battering of humanity's grime, and almost succumbed to it. In BvS, he became the villains he vowed to defeat. His goals were no longer clear, and he was blinded by misplaced rage in Superman. He, like the rest of the world, no longer believed in an absolute good, something that Superman represents. Because of that, the distrusts grew and he resented what Superman stands for. 

Wonder woman is born of an ideal of absolute good. She was created from the single purpose of defeating evil. She isn't so much a ""God killer"" as she is the killer of the God of War, which makes her the embodiment of peace. Another absolute ideal. Do you kinda see where DC is going vs Marvel? Think about the kind of heroes Marvel produces vs DC, and the qualities and beliefs they hold. She was untainted at the beginning, and was compelled to spread peace. She thought that she could solve everything by defeating another absolute ideal. But she found that the world is much more complicated than that. Yet in the end, she found that  no matter how complicated the world is, it is the absolute that will lead humanity through. For her that's love. For Batman it's the absolute good in Superman, and for Superman it is in the ultimate act of sacrifice. The themes at work in these films are so compelling and fascinating that I cannot wait to see what's next.

dijcg4g,I liked Wonder woman. It was like someone made Thor better by making it Captain America. I especially liked the last scene when Goku went Super Saiyan after Steve Batman'd himself in order to stop Emperor Palpatine.,6erigc
dj0zdoi,"Gal Gadot's performance was good. I liked her interactions with the unfamiliar world of man and how she navigates it. 

The action was ok. The first few training scenes had so many cuts for each punch/kick/strike, it was very distracting. Was not a fan of the slo mo scenes. The action scenes towards the end of the movie got better. Less cuts. The final fight with aries was entertaining.


The themes of this movies were all over the place. Diana wants to save innocent lives. She believes men are good and just and only commit evil because of aries. So she tries to save as many human lives as she can, but fuck german soldiers. Lets slaughter then becuase they deserve to die for some reason. For a movie that supposedly tries to show war in a faceted way, to display the humanity and horror of it, it still has the dichotomy of germans = bad, english and america = good


In the end Diana understands that humans have both good and evil in them and they fight for their own purposes and reasons instead of aries manipulating them. Yet when she defeated aries, everyone became friends for some reason. So aries really was controlling them?

Some nitpicking here and there: 

- Why the heck are German speaking English?

- Why do they need to shoehorn a fucking American soldier and a Native American into WW 1?

- The ""horror"" of war felt poorly portrayed and too bland for me. WW1 was brutal and I felt like the movie tried to say something but what comes out did not do it justice.

- Horrible villains.

Not that I hate it per se but it's an incredibly ok-ish movie. ",6erigc
djjjbio,"I'm sorry but to me, the final fight with Ares ruined the whole movie.

Ares was way too CHEESY, like, unhealthily cheese. He was talking like a saturday morning cartoon villain, Doofenshmirtz or Scooby doo tier.

I was banging my head thinking about how Marvel would have handled this better by being self-aware. I see a lot of Marvel detractors saying that the jokes are annoying, but it would have been welcome to see an annoyed Diana telling him to shut up making a witty remark or something.

But the moment never came, Ares was talking about death death death war evil evil blablahblah and then Diana becomes even cheesier and oh my god why.

Movie was ok up until that point, then it looks like a parody of superheroes by taking itself too seriously, that final act was written by a kid I'm sure. 

Evil McWargore fights Princess Diana and Diana wins with the power of love and friendship... for real.. I don't think I can get over it, ESPECIALLY when the rest of the movie was going in the right direction. I liked the ongoing joke about an innocent Diana believing she can solve a war by killing some magical god that doesn't exist, it was subtle, it was nice, and most importantly, it would have helped DC to DIFFERENTIATE THEMSELVES FROM MARVEL. Like, ""whoa so DC is more grounded in reality, really adult stuff"", but the final fight came out of nowhere and was a mess.

Also I thought the action was bad. I dunno how can a fight feel fake in 2017, I thought they had already mastered film techniques. I mean, Wonder Woman doesn't even have any flashy powers, just her doing some martial arts would have looked fine, but I was instead wondering if I could see the strings holding her up in the air if I focused enough. Also the slowmo.


This movie had potential, and had good characters. A lot better than any last DC movie, but still pales in comparison to Marvel, they have little things that could be fixed and I don't know how can't they see it. You show me this movie a year before it airs and I would have known what to change, why didn't they check it up? 

And those comparisons with Marvel shouldn't stop, they are direct competitors. If only Coca Cola and Pepsi Cola existed, and Pepsi tasted like crap, it would only be fair to tell them to step their game up. With Superhero movies, pretty much only Marvel and DC exist, and one is clearly refusing to take notes.",6erigc
djrlj6y,"I've seen this movie twice and honestly, Wonder Woman was one of the best super hero movies I've seen in years.

-	The characters were really likeable. Especially Diana and Steve. The rest of the cast was always had just the right amount of screen time. They were developed, they were interesting, but they weren’t featured to the point of annoyance or overshadowing the main character. Even Steve, who was a great character, knew when to take a backseat and let Diana have the spotlight.

-	The acting was great. Gal Gadot was an amazing Wonder Woman. In every scene, emotional, funny or badas, she always portrayed the character perfectly. Chris Pine was great as Steve. The humor he added to the film never felt out of place, and his acting was amazing in emotional scenes. [Ares](#spoiler) looked a bit weird but his acting was still on point. And everyone else did their job pretty well.

-	The story and the characters had heart. I actually cared about what happens to those characters, which is not something that happens often in super hero movies. I really wanted Diana to succeed, and I felt like cheering whenever she did something badass, and felt genuinely sad whenever things got emotional.

-	The action scenes were great. Especially the No-Man’s-Land scene was amazing. Not just the scene itself, but also the buildup to that scene since the beginning of the movie. It just felt satisfying as hell. I could watch Diana kick some ass for hours.

-	The humor was great. Don’t get me wrong, it wasn’t something that would make you laugh ot loud, but it didn’t try to do that. Instead, the movie had some natural comical scenes that made the viewers smile and appreciate the characters more. And it knew when to be serious. The characters didn’t turn to camera and say some wisecracks during an intense action scene. It was a humor that appeared naturally because of the situation they were in.

-	It never felt preachy. Of course, since this was during WW1, things like sexism had to be adressed, but it never got to the point of annoyance. Wonder Woman showed the strenght of a female hero, but it never went too far, and it never brought up the whole gender differences thing when it came to serious scenes. Every character was unique, and was treated fairly, male or female, and while Diana’s superiority was definitely there, it was because she really was amazing, it was a simple fact, and part of the character.

-	The romance. Diana and Steve actually had a heartwarming and believable relationship. The love and respect those two have for each other was one of the highlights of the movie.

-	Diana’s growth, both as a character and when it comes to strenght. Her discovering her true strenght throughout the movie was a brilliant choice, which made everything she made look amazing. If Diana that could so the things she does at the end of the film was there from the beginning, her jumping to a tower or blocking bullets wouldn’t look impressive. However, since she herself doesn’t know her own limits, and discovers her powers throughout the journey alongside the audience, it makes every feat she portrays more impressive (and the scale of her fights also gradually grows, always keeping the audience in suspence). As for her character, I love the character development she has. She starts as naive, but it never gets to the point of stupidity.. She is just in an unfamiliar environment and she is an idealistic person. Then she slowly learns the truth about humanity (which is an amazing scene, both from acting and writing standpoint.) but then at the end, her faith in humanity is restored some degree. The changes she goes through while stil keeping the heart of the character is really great. And her relationship with all the other characters (Steve, Amazons, the other people in their group) helped giving her character more depht.

-	The message of the movie. [I love how they tide in Ares’ involvement. He appears, proving Diana right, but then shows that it wasn’t him that started all these wars. He just gave humans weapons to use. It was still them who fired those guns. So while Ares was involved, it was still the corruption of humanity that lead to this. It wasn’t blamed on one guy.](#spoiler)

-	Wonder Woman was a real hero. This might sound obvious, but I mean that she was a hero just because she felt that this is the right thing to do. She didn’t have a tragic past, or something that forced her to become what she is, she is just a genuinely good hearted person, who wants to help people. She doesn’t maket he hero business about herself, she makes it about the people she protects, and this type of hero is not very  common in recent movies. 

In short, I really loved this movie. Probably my favorite movie this year. It doesn’t mean that it was flawless, it definitely had some problems like slight bit of overused CGI and slow motions, and the final fight wasn’t as grandious as the previous fights, but the movie was so good that it was easy to overlook those flaws. Conguratulations DC, you made a great movie, and made Wonder Woman one of my favorite super heroes. Hope you can keep this trend going.

ditjlzo,"I think there are 3 reasons why I like this movie so much. 

1) there have been plenty of live action films about Batman, Superman, Spiderman, etc within the past 20 years or so. This is the first live action film to feature Wonder Woman as the main character. It just feels like a breath of fresh air in the whole comic book superhero genre that seems to be usually dominated by the same core of characters over and over. 

2) I think the somewhat juxtaposing values portrayed between both Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor relate to an average persons thinking. Like WW, I think people generally want to help others and stick up for those who can't stick up for themselves. Then, like Steve Trevor, we realize that we must pick and choose our battles and that the world actually is full of both bad and good people (from a moral/ethical standpoint) and that conflict will basically always exist. 

3) referring to my previous point, I thought the acting during the tower scene right after the Ludendorff ""battle"" was spot on. Steve was so frustrated with Diana's naive worldview in that moment, and I thought that the acting from both Gal Gadot and Chris Pine were amazing, especially Pine. I felt as frustrated as Steve did in that moment, and it just looked like such a natural reaction to how anyone would feel hearing that from Diana. And you almost can't even blame Diana for feeling that way in that moment since she has never really dealt with human nature before. I personally thought that was the best scene of the movie. Very powerful, and it made me think a lot more about life and gave me a lot of food for thought, probably more than any other recent superhero movie I can remember.

It would have been nice to see them try something a little different with the fight against Ares. They established that he could push men to fight - it would have been interesting to see him make Wonder Woman's allies turn on her or something like that, instead of the standard CGI battle at the end. 

I was honestly extremely excited when [Erich Ludendorf was killed](#spoiler) and it looked like the war would just keep going - it seemed like a good way to demonstrate the flaws in mankind and how there is both good and evil. The film could have ended with Wonder Woman working with the good guys to win the war, and her admitting that whilst there is evil, there is also greatness etc etc.

The CGI was pretty mediocre in parts, and it seemed like Wonder Woman's friends just kind of ran around without much of a plan - it would have been good to see a bit of espionage and had some time to shine - rather than just being superficial stereotypes. 

Definitely a step in the right direction for the DCEU!

Chris took this scene and made it so raw and so heartbreaking by the way he interacted with Gal. This was a truly remarkable scene.
I feel people aren’t giving Chris or Gal enough credit. Yes, they are talking about this scene, but they are not talking about what was involved in it. How it became remarkable and why it is.",6erigc
dnh5uui,"Most impressive to me was the chemistry and dialogue between the two leads. So funny, lol. Also the actress's facial expressions were powerful, she really gave off that vibe of someone who is both innocent, strong and has a deep love for living things. And most, if not all the Amazonian's were believable as badass warriors. My only complaint was the actor who played Ares, wasn't intimidating at all, lol. 8/10",6erigc

dim0itu,"Honestly I really enjoyed the movie as I do most movies but definitely didn't seem as good as everyone's been rating it. I'm a little surprised about the overly positive response I mean I did really like it but there was so much I couldn't get over. The whole god world into human world just didn't work for me it felt SO weird. And I know this is normal in these kinds of movies but how casual everyone was with her being a superhuman and all just bothered me a little. Also the ending just felt super odd [when he popped up out of nowhere was teleporting then formed armor then was defeated by the power of love very quickly](#spoiler) I didn't like that much. Also how was everyone still minding their own business while that was happening? Anywho I think the worst part of it all was [ARES, THE GOD OF WAR HAD F***ING MOUSTACHE*. During the part where he flashed back to Zeus defeating him when he was shown on the ground then looked up with his stache had me and my friend literally laughing out loud. Also at the end when he carved out his helmet and u could see the stache it was just not right haha I couldn't take him seriously. Professor Lupin just doesn't work as The God of War for me. I was fine with the actor and what he did and everything but he just felt too funny looking and also too old to be her brother and I just felt like it really didn't fit but he wasn't *bad* I just didn't think it was the best choice](#spoiler). Other than that and other things I did really enjoy watching it. Great characters I must say I really loved Wonder Woman and Steve they were great, along with the 3 amigos (forget names) and Steve's ~~slave~~ secretary. Even Dr. Poison and [fake Ares](#spoiler) guy were good. Gal was amazing extra shoutout because I'm in love again (last time was after F&F) shes soooo amazing and beautiful and amazing and super gorgeous...and amazing :)  so yea a lot of the ideas bothered me but overall I really enjoyed it and would watch again.",6erigc
dioxf7i,"I can solidly say it exceeded my expectations overall. The action and humor gave it a balanced enough tone. It was fun without feeling like any particular bit was over the top. (As far as a superhero film goes, that is to say.) 

That being said, the ending fight felt...kind of....weird. I liked David Thewlis as Ares when he was doing his talky bit. He's the kind of actor I can see playing a villain who's really good at just talking to people. 

In other words, arguably the most dangerous *kind* of villain, and a pretty big subversion of what you'd expect from THE god of war while still completely being logically within his skill set. Strategy and negotiation are major parts of war, and war is HIS deal. I totally believed he could be the ""bad guy,"" right up until the fight went all super-villain CGI and it was Remus Lupin screaming and beating the crap out of Wonder Woman.

But I get it. Nobody wants a superhero movie where the hero and the villain just talk things out and come to a mutual understanding. I can't fault anyone for playing it safe, and I really don't. ",6erigc
dj0u45f,"a few things.. 
. I did enjoy the movie..but i have a few things that bothered me as I reflected on it. 
. The final action sequence was a bit too much for me, in a film that showed the horrors of modern warfare (the gas, how the bullets ripped through the amazons etc.) the final battle is the two gods literally throwing shit at each-other and then conjuring lighting out of the air and sending it back and forth..idk..just reminded me of Superman a bit..just because they are gods doesnt mean you have to have the battle just be throwing as much elemental crap at eachother for what seemed like 15 minutes.

. The minor characters were completely underdeveloped almost at a comical level. Especially Steve's three companions...he brings the three along so he can harness their skill sets to help with the mission..and what do they contribute..Sameer (despite knowing a shit ton of languages, does half a job convincing a guard to let them into the party..in broken english)..Chief builds a fire and lets out a smoke signal (GET IT) to help WW track Lindelof..and Charlie..struggles to snipe the sniper in the bell tower and WW/Sammy have an exchange like ""we cant always be who we want to be"" or something like that..which totally teased some redeeming snipe/moment later in the movie..except that never happens..so i guess Charlie was there to rediscover his love of war time british piano ballads. I know this movie was about WW and you're trying to build some character background..and that we will never see those three again..but still..that bothered me a bit..but maybe thats the inner guy in me being like ""I want to know more about the men!""

Why was Chief so beloved amongst the soldiers in the trench? They were all like ""hey everyone Chief's here!!!"" like that uncle who slips you a $20 every christmas just for shits.     ",6erigc
djgirsq,"So me and my buddy went to see it and while it was an okay movie, I'm unsure why it gets near universal acclaim from audience and critics alike. It felt very... safe, formulaic and thus kinda dull. The fact that nearly all the cool moments were shown in the trailers didn't really help either. Overall the film had several minor to medium issues that when pooled together kinda drags it down. That said, spoilers ahead.

#SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERS

- Diana is the only child on Paradise Island
-
Or at least we're told this and as far as I can recall, no other children were shown except young Diana. Yet we're told later that Diana is fully aware where babies come from and how they're made. So... is this a contradiction? Or are all Amazons blessed with unnatural long lifespans? They just reproduce once every century or millennia or something? How do they get the men, which apparently is essential when making tiny amazons? Go fish?

**Workaround: Just show other kids there goddamnit. Diana can be curious about where the badass soldiers take the men, but is pulled away because studies/training/she's too young for that shit.**
- Military training is not for princesses
-
Why? She's the Princess, she'll (presumably) inherit the throne. She's an amazon, born and raised in a warrior culture. You'd think she'd of all people would be given all the training she'd ever need, since leading by example out in the field of battle and not cower behind a desk is the Amazon way. 

**Workaround: Mommy dearest insists right out the gate that Diana is trained day and night, harder like anyone else because she's royalty and the expectations put on her shoulders are much greater than the run of the mill soldier. Diana can still be rebellious against her mother that she hungers for the world beyond the barrier when her mom would rather have her home safe and sound. They might not even see eye to eye on how men are caught, used and then discarded.**
- Magical ~~barrier~~ two-way mirror
-
As neat as the visuals of going through the fog and barrier to see paradise beyond were, in hindsight it made me go *""Wait, so all they have for protection is a magical fog and a two-way mirror? It's not even a proper barrier?""* I was kinda hoping that Steve's plane got damaged because he flew into the barrier and punched through with sheer force, thus wrecking his plane. Nah, it has the density of a fog.

**Workaround: When sufficient force is applied to the barrier, you can punch through it. Like I mentioned, Steve punches through with his airplane, wrecking it. Likewise, the larger German boat bumps into something, they put more power into the engine and manages to slip through. This might even damage their ship, causing them to abandon it.**

- Whatever happened to the German boat?
-
So the smaller boats make landfall and fighting starts, but that big boat then? Turn around and leave? Send for reinforcements? Did the Amazon's sink it? How? All they brought to the fight were swords, shields, spears, bows, and arrows. Don't they have like many gifts from the gods? A pet Kraken or something? Or are they literally putting all their eggs in one basket, a basket made of magical fog?

**Workaround: As mentioned earlier, if the barrier is stronger than just a fog the ship can take enough damage breaching it to warrant an abandon ship scenario. Or maybe the Amazons have some magical trinket or two that totally wrecks the ship with one devastating blow. Or a pet of ancient myth that can really ruin their day. Just... something more badass than just smoke and mirrors.**

- When in Rome...
-
For someone that claims to be well read and educated, Diana sure doesn't know the ABC of matters of state, war or diplomacy. I see that Paradise Island is safe and sound in her hands when she (again presumably) inherits the throne. It is not foolish to take the advice of others, especially when you're dipping your toes into unknown waters. Sure she doesn't have to like or agree with World War One London's view on women. But barging into a room with leaders of the country and armies, preaching, and borderline ridicule them for their ways is not how you build bridges to potential allies. That's how you burn them down. Many of the comedic ""fish out of water"" culture clashes felt like I was laughing at Diana, not with her. 

**Workaround: Diana can be ignorant about the outside world, but eager to learn. These learning experiences can be funny and endearing moments. Her social antennas are sharp enough to know when to speak and when to listen. Being a skilled diplomat, Diana knows how to voice her disagreement in a smart, tactful way without sounding like a naive child.**

- Crossing No Man's Land with style and grace
-
When Diana steps out of the trenches, my God does she look gorgeous. Like a supermodel on the catwalk covered in mud. Not a single hair on her flawless eyebrows are out of place. A true warrior who commands respect from everyone around her. Also after all that fighting, she's not hurt at all, not tired and not even dirty. Kudos for having silky smooth armpits though. Even in the front yard of Hades, with people sick, wet, cold and dying around her, she's her priorities in order; can't fight a war without looking perfectly flawless. Though to be fair, not a single speck of concrete dust landed on Superman's hair after he and Zod leveled about 80% of Metropolis.

**Workaround: Let her be/get dirty/weathered. She's traveling on foot with an all guy crew, not riding a limousine with a platoon of make-up artists hot on her heels. A mortar shell lands next to her? Shower her with mud and dirt. Hurt her, she's a warrior that can take some pain. Make her tremble and shake from the pure adrenaline rush that comes with wounds, pains and pushing herself beyond her limits. Make no mistake; Diana is in danger. She's taking a huge risk crossing that land, but with wit, skill, courage and some help from her fellow soldiers, they win the day. Steve tends to her wounds the following night. If Diana not only takes everything almost in an effortless stride but looks flawlessly beautiful doing so makes me ask the question: ""why should I root for her? She's got this so by the balls that she doesn't even get a speck of mud on her.""**
- Shuffling priorities
-
So Diana is all about Ares. Kill him, which only she can do and- OH! A baby! Sorry? The war is that way, but you need to go this way to hand in a book? Screw you, I gotta kill Ares. Like right now. I know we're running out of time and our main objective is this way, but that village! We gotta save that village that is of no major tactical or strategic importance. We don't have time because we'll lose our target, Ares? But the village! Oh, there he is, on the dance floor. I'm gonna make up for lost time and stab him. Deep into enemy territory and I'm in a fancy prom dress rather than armor and bullets can actually hurt me? Fuck it, it's stabbin' time!

**Workaround: Just show some common sense. Be smart, be tactical. Help people along the way, but don't lose sight of your objective; killing Ares. Save the village because it is the shortest route towards your objective, don't make it seem like a pit stop/detour. Don't (gracefully) stomp into a party with no other plan than stab, stab, flee. Chances are Ares, the god of motherfucking WAR, isn't going to roll over like a bitch. If the village fight is anything to go by, there's going to be collateral damage when you two duke it out. You don't want that, not after preaching about how Steve & Co needed to stop dead in their tracks and help people in some godforsaken village.**

- Evil bad guy is evil, obviously
-
Fair enough that our good German general is a little on the odd side and wants the war to go on forever (or just straight up win it, I dunno). So he kills the opposition, but did he have to laugh like an idiot over the cruel joke about the gas mask? Yes, this is based on comic books, but holy shit... At least commit fully and give him a mustache he can twirl.

**Workaround: I'm not sure about this one. Maybe showing Ares doing something doubtful, like playing both sides to ensure that the war goes on for as long as possible. Encouraging some British chap to make an even nastier weapon? Setting up for some long con zero sum game? At least then Ares won't show up for the last 10 minutes.**

- Look at me. I'm the Godslayer now.
-
Okay, ignoring that Ares comes out of fucking nowhere, I gotta give credit where credit is due. The temptation with the lasso and destruction of the sword was dope as fuck. That said, the big reveal that Diana was the weapon and not the sword is problematic as hell. Hear me out.

- Diana was not born - instead, her mother sculpted her out of clay and Zeus gave her life

- Ares (or was it someone else?) confirms that the Godslayer was the contingency plan because while Ares was defeated, he was not killed. Zeus could not carry on the fight, passed on the torch to the Amazons and their Godslayer weapon.

- The Godslayer was created for the sole purpose to kill Ares. 

- Ergo, Diana is not all that different from a terminator. She's created for a single purpose, she's a weapon, very good at combat and near unstoppable in battle.

Given all the ancient mythos that ties into the lore around Wonder Woman, it's fitting that her mother tries to resist fate and no one can oppose fate, not even the gods. However, I have a big problem that Wonder Woman does NOT choose to go out into the world and do good. She's merely a ""robot"" or a tool, fulfilling her purpose. A purpose dictated by a male deity no less. Yeah, that's some hard hitting feminism right there...

**Workaround: Diana is born from her mother and Zeus. In classical myth, Zeus is notorious for sticking his dick into every hole he could find. At least then she's born like everyone else and thus have a shot at being a subject of free will rather than a sentient weapon/super soldier.**",6erigc

diifa8r,"As a woman, I think I'm expected to completely love this movie but ehhhh. Most everyone has mentioned my major gripes but here's two nit-picky ones: 1. It really bothered me that Charlie wasn't given a moment. I've mentioned to a few people and they just said he was there to ""show the effects of PTSD."" I mean they could've done that AND let him have a hero moment. He reminded me of Ethan Hawke's character in the Magnificent Seven remake only that guy actually had a reason to be there.  I felt like he didn't do anything but be a stereotype. 2. Her make-up OMG. I know everyone wears make-up in movies, including the men, but I hated how she had perfect eyeliner and lipstick on in his final fight. What she had her make-up case out there? And she was all done up before the gala (which I thought was a pretty unnecessary scene in itself) and even then, why bother? It would've just wasted time. 

Once again, just two petty reasons I haven't seen really talked about. ",6erigc
dinijd1,"One of most hilarious moments, intentional or not, is when Ares shows up as an old British man to gloat at Diana. Diana has this panicked look when she realizes that her sword is still stuck on the roof in the gut of a dead German general. The movie cuts to Chris Pine's scene and then cuts back to Diana jumping down from the roof after retrieving her sword. That sequence is hilarious and belongs in a sitcom, you can imagine Ares looking at his watch and sighing as he waits for Wonder Woman to retrieve her sword. You could argue that Ares is in character since he knows the sword isn't Godkiller but its still so tonally wrong.

As cliche as it is, one thing that could have helped the ending would be giving Ares a death monologue. Something like ""You know why Zeus couldn't kill me, Diana? It's because as long as humans let greed and hatred into their hearts, I will always be there to lead them into war. I will return, Diana because they will me to."" And Diana can respond with some quippy one liner about how she's be there to stop him with the power of love. Just a little cap end to acknowledge that more wars will happen and that Diana and the rest of Amazonians still have a job to do. Maybe you don't have to bring Ares back physically but just have him be manifest in human hearts. Anything to make DC villains more interesting.",6erigc
diqtnop,"Overall, I enjoyed the movie. Gal and Chris were great, as was Robin Wright. 

One thing that bothered me was how anti-climatic the ending was. Basically she drove the sword through Ares, which then broke. He then **immediately** tells her that she is the [Godkiller (ie. she doesn't need a sword](#spoiler)...which allows her to be aware that she can win the fight). That line of dialogue should be omitted, and then even without the Godkiller she still attempts to fight Ares because it is what she believes in, no matter how hopeless. However, throughout the fight she realizes that the power is within her. When Ares strikes her with lightning, she believes and shouts 'I am the Godkiller' and strikes him down. 

This would allow for much better character development during the fight. It would save the audience from being bored and adding suspense to an otherwise generic fightscene. That scene would have been much better if there was no hope of Diana winning. Lastly, it allows her to discover her destiny on her own terms, as throughout much of the movie she relied on people conveying her information.  ",6erigc

dieas33,"Loved a lot about this movie.

First, the characters. I was more invested in the Amazons and Chris Pine's friends than I was any character in Suicide Squad. Chris Pine as Steve Trevor was great. I loved that scene when [he is about to blow up the plane. He has his gun out and he just... pauses. He takes a breath to accept his fate before pulling the trigger](#spoiler).

Gal Godot as Wonder Woman was also very good. I didn't know how they were going to handle her. Her character is all about mystery in BvS, so I didn't know what to expect. I was very happy. She was naive when she needed to be, powerful when she needed to be, wise when she needed to be... all around it felt like every reaction she had to the outside world was natural. What I didn't want was a Wonder Woman who was either all super positive, or a Wonder Woman who was up on her high horse because she's a princess. She was neither of those. She was driven, determined, confused, but most of all... good. She is a good person with incredible gifts, and that really shined through in this film. 

And Godot's performance was pretty good. Her physicality was on-point and she actually does get some quieter moments that made me go, ""Woah, she can act."" Will she be getting Oscar nods anytime soon? No. But she carried the movie well enough and really played well off of Chris Pine.

Like others have said, the action is for the most part very impressive. The no-mans land sequence and the fight scene in the town immediately after that are the high points. Great, well-shot action throughout those scenes.

Music was actually used pretty well. They would play the rift in small bursts whenever she was doing something badass and it never really got old for me.

This movie is also pretty freaking gorgeous. The color scheme is such a breath of fresh air when compared to other DC films. Obviously Themyscira is a beautifully shot location in the film (not sure where it was actually shot), but there is a scene with mustard gas and the color there was done perfectly.

Now there are negatives:

The villain is a bit underwhelming and [if you're looking for Ares, it's kinda easy to tell who he is... I saw the twist of it being the politician very early on.](#spoiler)

The final action sequence was also probably the worst. The CGI looked a little off at times and the way she overcomes the issue at hand isn't really explained. Also, the villain's powers and hers aren't really ever explained either. They're just powerful and can do some shit.

Overall a pretty damn fine superhero movie. Definitely not top 10, but maybe hovering somewhere around the mid-to-low teen range for me.

dih3ep1,"I was an extra, one of the soldiers on the dock. It was only for half a second, but I saw myself on an actual movie theater screen in a crowded theater for the #1 movie in the country. It was a rush like no other!",6erigc
dk2k732,"I don't like it. Its not the worst superhero movie ever made but it most certainly is not a masterpiece. My impression is that the filmmakers had a vision in mind as to how Wonder Woman needed to be portrayed and what the ending was to be when they began filming. Somewhere in the middle, they began to say something interesting and rather than continue on their inquiry these people decided to pan the camera back to Gal Gadot so the audience can gush over how perfect she is.

My two specific issues with this film:

* The film concludes that humans engage in violence on their own accord and are imperfect but nevertheless are redeemable by the virtue of love. Fine. But note that suddenly after the defeat of Ares by Wonder Woman that the German's who had just spent the last 2 hours shooting at the Americans/British literally decide in that exact scene that they were really pals all along. Legit, the Native American guy puts his arm around a German soldier as if they weren't trying to kill each other 5 mins ago. So it was Ares all along?
* Wonder Woman is supposed to undergo some process of realisation as to how ugly war is and what it does to the people it involves. She goes into the muddy front lines, kills a few German soldiers and out she emerges looking like she's runway ready. She looks absolutely magnificent in these action sequences. This was ironically subtle in its poor taste. The Great War involved people dying in astoundingly squalid conditions. There was mud. There were corpses. There were rats. There were rats in the mud eating the corpses. I don't understand why someone would take this subject matter and then film it like its a L'Oreal commercial. 

Very superficial film. It is non-committal to the themes it attempts to explore. I would love to hear from someone that actually liked it though because I'm struggling to think of its redeeming qualities. ",6erigc

dimz5td,"I spent the whole movie pretty confident that Diana was going to turn out to be Ares' daughter. It seemed obvious to me due to her supernatural abilities, a seemingly innate fascination with warfare as a child, and her mother's explicit fear that the closer she got to fighting the easier it'd be for him to find her.         
            
In some ways I'm glad that didn't turn out to be the case. I mean sure, she was still *made* to be badass in a sense, but it makes her much more independent in nature than just being Ares' byblow.        
          
Plus I don't know how in-depth an Ares/Hippolyta relationship could have been portrayed within the time constraints of the movie.",6erigc
dj8z0cl,"One thing that pains me when watching a movie is seeing one fairly obvious change in the movie that could have made it significantly better, and for me this was the main human villain of the movie. I'm putting this as a spoiler just in case.

Non-spoiler version: The writers missed a HUGE opportunity where Dr. Maru would have made a much more effective antagonist than who they ended up going with if they had developed her character more. They could have let her parallel Diana’s journey as essentially being a woman who is the opposite of her. It would have made you care about Diana more, it would have made you feel moral ambiguity in sympathizing and relating to the villain, and it would have emphasized the points the movie was *trying* to make much better.

[Lundendorff is the weakest human villain I think I've ever seen in a movie, but Dr. Maru is chilling as soon as she's introduced. The first scene of her testing the gas is super eerie because without her even speaking they use her movements and mannerisms to express that she's angry, nervous, insane, and intelligent which makes her very interesting. Why not make her the main villain?](#spoiler)

[I'm imagining a scenario where they keep Ludendorff as the red herring he so obviously is, but instead of trying to have a crazy twist with Sir Patrick being Ares (not much of a twist, I called it from the second scene he's in), let Maru reveal herself as the one pulling the strings.](#spoiler)

[Imagine this: Maru is a brilliant chemist who dedicates herself to science in order to help the world, but then has an accident in her lab and gets those horrible facial scars. Now, even though she's a brilliant scientist the world is super sexist, as is implied by the second act of the movie, and everyone only sees her as hideous because of her scars and doesn't care about her mind or talent. She becomes filled with rage and hatred and says ""you know what, fuck the world"". Here comes Ares who can't resist taking advantage of her being corrupted by the flaws of the human world and he says to Maru ""you know what, you're right, let's end it together"". He forms a pact with her to help her create this gas, but the gas is not just a deadly nerve agent; it's the essence of Ares himself. She agrees to spread his influence to the world via the gas and make every person exposed to it become a vicious monster that wants to kill whoever they see.](#spoiler)

[This would do a few things I think would be cool: It would further the feminist message in creating a main human villain who becomes corrupted due to sexism and superficial prejudice; it would reinforce the moral ambiguity of Diana defending humans when the main villain became evil due to the cruel nature of people themselves, and with very little influence needed from Ares; it wouldn't have relied on a weak twist villain and would have instead given you a villain you can't help but relate to, which makes for a more intense end battle; it would have given Diana a villain that was the opposite of herself (scarred vs. perfect, hateful vs. hopeful, cunning vs. strong), and having a villain whose journey parallels the heroes journey ALWAYS makes for a more powerful and engaging villain; it would add a nice metaphor treatment to chemical weapons, one of the most horrible things mankind has ever concoted, as a parallel to the inherent viciousness of humans, something it seemed like they were trying to touch on in this movie but didn't do a great job of; Ares could still have been in the story, but as more of an ethereal and spooky force instead of as Remus Lupin in armor, which would put more emphasis on the flaws of humanity being the real evil and almost exonerate Ares in a way as a manifestation of human nature, which is in essence what the Greek gods are anyway; overall, Diana would have a more complex emotional journey of realizing that her mission was to defend humankind forever, but that she would more often than not have to defend them from themselves versus supernatural deities.](#spoiler)",6erigc
dn3fp21,"I found the film quite entertaining, but I had some issues with a couple of things:

This one's small, but I found it a bit annoying, that the Germans spoke with a german accent instead of actually speaking in german.

How do they get to London? From my understanding Steve was somewhere in Turkey, Diana in Greek waters so even if the island was on the western side of Greece, it still would be a roughly ~5000 km journey in a shitty old sailboat on open sea.

Why does Diana agree so fast to changing out of her armor, and giving the arguably most important item she's carrying with herself (the sword) to a random woman she met 2 hours beforehand.

How can someone get the jump on a spy and the best warrior the amazons have to offer in an alley.

[When Diana is crossing the no man's land why don't the Germans fire at her feet?](#spoiler)

[-I feel like when she jumped up to the church tower she should have exerted enough force that it would have at least crushed their arms, plus I don't understand why she simply didn't jump up by herself, because I don't think she needed that ~3m boost.](#spoiler)

[-Why'd Diana leave at the banquet? I get why she left after they fired the shot, because it might be more important to save innocent people than kill Ludendorff to her, but why was she going out before that and not trying to kill him?](#spoiler)

[-How is the German base so easy to penetrate that all of them get in, Diana kills Ludendorff (pretty extravagantly) and no german soldier is the wiser.](#spoiler)

[-This one's a bit stupid, but when Ares shows Diana his memories he has the exact same hair and moustache as he does in the present, which is weird considering Ares' usual depictions](#spoiler)

[-Couldn't Steeve just land the plane and use timed tnt to blow it up?](#spoiler)

I Loved the first act of the movie but the pacing just went out the window for me after that. Far too rushed, trying to squeeze too much stuff into the film. Nothing was done with the motley crew of charlie, sameer and the native american(did anyone else feel he was distractingly bad actor on screen?), they seemed completely superfluous caricatures and just felt like filler every time they were on screen. Any opportunity to flesh out the characters was just dropped(e.g charlie's panic) they were in a weird middle ground of not enough screen time and too much screen time.

Though my main gripe is with how the final act went just weird direction. Ares just sunk this movie in my eyes. They had something interiguing with the death of luddendorff and the continued fighting, it would have been interesting to see her deal with the reality of mankind and war but instead we got comical villan with cringey exposition, ""IT WAS ME ALL ALONG!!"" followed by a giant CGI battle that I couldn't have cared less about.

Chief was used as exposition plot to tell Diana an example of what happens in war. His character is empty.

They took away Charlie's moment to shine and gave it to Diana when she already had tons of moments, something that felt like a cop out just to give Diana more moments. (I know, I know PTSD but they dont really do anything with it)

What the hell did Sameer do, other than just be another source of exposition for Diana

Steve, he's a great character that bounces off of Diana. best action scene ended up him sacrificing himself which just felt weird because it took him to die for Diana to go berserk and start rampaging. I'm pretty sure this is one of those cliches that gets ridiculed a majority of the time.

Steves a weird German spy. If you're going to use subtitles for other languages I expect you to have Germans speak German and have subtitles. Don't half ass it. Commit to it.

In my opinion the acting was good to great but nothing special. The action/fighting scenes where great, even though the final battle was a little over the top in my opinion.

* The movie flowed way better than Bats v. Supes and Suicide Squad. It was just shy of 2 hours 30 minutes, but new stuff kept happening so often that you hardly noticed it.

* The fight scenes were very well done. Wonder Woman stepping out into No Man's Land was one of the most awesome things I've seen in a super hero movie.

* There were a lot of visually novel scenes we haven't seen in a super hero movie. I especially liked Wonder Woman's fight scenes involving her lasso.

Things I didn't like: 

* Ares, and subsequently the final battle, was ultimately disappointing.  It just felt like another CGI mess.

* The back story for the movie was kind of weak, and I didn't like how it left no room for future appearances of the Greek Gods.

dj227ut,"Obviously late, but I'll give it a go. 

Alright, I'm going to give a highly unpopular opinion. I think this movie was disappointing at best in two ways. First, the hype set my expectations far too high. Second, the first (Wonder Woman growing up and meeting Trevor), and second parts (Wonder woman entering the war) were handled exceptionally well. They really handled her development well by conveying a person who's shocked by all the nastiness of the world while never having her appear weak either physically or mentally. That was fantastic.


But Goddamn that ending.....

I know several people have already said that the super-god lightning fight was over the top and that it was predictable who Ares really was, but I that was a symptom of a much larger problem. Backing up, I really liked the true villain in this movie. The enemy wasn't a supervillain, it was war itself. It's a lot easier to kill one dude than fixed a world that's all fucked up. This was a really good idea for a few reasons. First off, original and creative idea. Awesome! Second, we don't have that easily obtained moral high ground with World War II that we got with the Captain America movie. You can kill Nazis all day long and you won't move one nanometer up in the morally evil scale. Not the same situation in World War I.

However, the movie completely abandoned this original idea by just putting a big, complex, messy war in a little box called Ares and lightened it to death in the last 20 minutes. What a letdown! They had all the pieces to make a unique and meaningful movie, and resorted to the standard action movie ending. I think there were two ways they could have handled the ending. One would be to have Dr. Marrow sacrifice herself to destroy the gas. Why the hell was Trevor the one in the plane? To give Diana and Ares a Luke Skywalker/Emperor Palpatine ""Join the Dark Side, strike her down in your anger"" scene? That was cringy as fuck. No, the way to stop war is to choose not to fight or kill, not explode someone with a huge lightning bolt. Dr. Poison put all her effort and life into killing, realized the error of her ways, and sacrificed herself to destroy the very weapons she created. That's how you stop war! It even plays directly into Ares own twisted justification. His point was ""All I do is give them weapons, they decide to use them to destroy others."" Her deciding to destroy her own weapons shows in a really powerful way just how wrong Ares was about humans.

Another possible twist would to have Ares actually be Zeus. After his final battle with Ares, he became corrupted and started trying to destroy and remake man. This would show Diana that humans aren't so different from the Gods, and that even they can be turned into spiteful and hateful beings if they have a bad enough day. Personally, I like the former ending a lot better, but I wouldn't have been too disappointment with the second. I was almost thinking that was the way they were going when Ares started using lightning.

This movie was the worst kind of disappointment. I was convinced Wonder Woman was going to be gold up until the last 20 minutes. The casting was spot on, beginning and middle were well paced, and the Character arcs of Wonder Woman and Trevor were great. If they had made a coherent ending that actually answered the questions (at least I thought) being asked in the beginning, I would put this one up with The Dark Knight. ",6erigc
dkp4wp6,"I wasn't really a fan of this movie. It was OK at best. For me, it didn't really reflect too well the comic's version of Wonder Woman, and they overused the CRAP out of slow motion...like.. to the point where it become impossible to ignore.

I'll get a lot of attacks for this, but I believe this wouldn't have been such a critically acclaimed movie if the film wasn't about a woman. It's 2017 and everyone wants to jump on the PC bandwagon, but really this movie was not that special.",6erigc

They were excellent, played their characters well and had great chemistry. While the pacing was ok, the story was mediocre, unoriginal, and ridiculously predictable, which leads me to believe this was just a ""going through the motions origin story"" and nothing else; this doesn't exactly deserve praise. Even the special effects were noticeably fake. If this movie had come out a decade ago before Captain America and the flood of super hero movies maybe it would have been different, but ultimately this is a textbook example of being beat by being last to market. Too bad. Gal Gadot and her version of Wonder Woman impressed me

dicitzi,"Why are guys named Steve so unlucky?

I really like this movie but I feel like I would have liked it more if Captain America: The First Avenger didn't exist. The WWI setting was great because without the obvious evil of Nazis and Hitler there is a grey area that leaves you questioning the nature of good and evil and if you should fight the good fight if the really good people end up dying anyway. Gal Gadot's Diana is great at capturing the purity of the character and she seems to have some developing comedic timing but it's not quite refined yet so occasionally falls flat. Chris Pine was being Chris Pine, attractive, oh so masculine, and on point at all times. I feel like he's putting in his time to grow in his craft and I expect to see more and better movies with him. 

I give it an 8 out of 10, a shockingly well made DC movie in an age of famine. It hits its notes most of the time and when it doesn't the whole is able to carry the story forward. The 3rd act was kind of rushed but I really don't know how to change it other than more Steve/Diana time.",6erigc

Is it perfect? Obviously not. The villains are a bit meh, and some of the stereotype shortcuts are a bit lazy (but understandable). Also, some of the jokes fail to hit home a bit, and as with any superhero movie, there's some CG that needed a bit of polish.

[Also, Steve's death at the end wasn't handled correctly. Unlike in Captain America, where the plane was damaged and was going to crash, in WW the plane was fine. In theory he could have at least tried to fly it and land it elsewhere.

Situation 1, he is about to lose the fight with the German soldier, and his hand is pinned to the floor under the German's boot with his pistol in it. He realises then the only choice he has is to shoot the bombs. Situation 2, he wins the fight against the co-pilot, deals with the other pilot, but is mortally wounded. Realising he will probably die before he can get the plane to a safe spot, he flies it as high into the sky as possible before pulling out his gun and shooting the bombs.](#spoiler)",6erigc

A fun use of a couple hours. Some decent humor, some fantastic action. The writing and acting was nothing special, but I really loved its core message.

One of the biggest laughs in our theater came after Diana destroyed the church tower and someone in the background yelled “Hebbde dat gezien?

dicho81,"I absolutely loved it. Saw it first chance I could last night; my girlfriend and I are big DC fans, but abhorred the offerings so far in the DCEU. Wonder Woman is one of my favourite characters and I honestly think patty Jenkins fucking nailed it.

The tone was excellent, but it had smatterings ofr humour and romance to give some respite from an otherwise harrowing tale of war.

Gal is perfect for Diana, like her bemusement at ""men's"" oddities, like watch and icecream (Justice League: War, anyone?) her naiveté in regards to the true nature of war and humanity, as well as her fierce passion for her cause (although I couldn't help be distracted by her flawless makeup, even after fighting for like 48 hours straight)

Pine was perfect as Steve. Hilarious, but broken and heroic. Leading the charge over No Man's Land after WW storms thru is a great moment, and the dancing in the square and the fact that they didn't make the sexual aspect at all gratuitous was great. His death at the end was so emotionally impacting; the fact that he couldn't quite get WW to understand why he had to do what he was doing made my manly tears flow for sure.

I will also say I'm so glad there was so little fan service for the upcoming JL film. There is one small mention of Bruce Wayne, and instead of the film ending with the team, it ended with WW triumphant. Wouldn't have been able to stomach any SH characters after such a well crafted film.

dicr2cy,"This is possibly my new favorite movie. The whole movie, but especially the no-mans-land scene was basically that moment in Lord of the Rings where Èowyn says ""I am no man."" and slays the wraith king. Where it just gives you chills and makes you feel so empowered as a woman. 
Some specific things I liked:
•She doesn't take orders or shit and waltzes right into meetings with men, but she's never bitchy about it. She shows how to be a powerful but graceful woman. 
•They use the dynamic of her beauty and her being sexualized, but they don't exploit it. 
•The love story is as secondary as it would be in your typical action movie, but at the same time it has real significance to the storyline instead of being something thrown in unneccesarily. 
•Steve isn't your typical douche-turned-hero like often would happen with a character like him. He's likeable but imperfect. He's very human, and that's important.",6erigc

dii3eft,"I need to point out that this movie, better than any comic book movie in recent memory, actually does a good job of capturing a *superhero* fantasy.

I love comic books. I love the idea of a superhero, but I feel like the definition of that word has sort of been lost on the big screen.

To me, a superhero is someone who sees injustice, or something wrong in the world, and has these powers/capabilities, and decides to help people, and fix the world. A superhero is the person we all feel like we could be if we were given the opportunity. Someone to aspire to.

I feel like comic book movies today all revolve around *saving* the world from a big bad instead of *improving* it, which to me is what I think of when I picture a superhero.

When we see Diana go over the top for the first time into no man's land, that's when the movie nailed it for me.
",6erigc
dilllul,"So I finally got around to watching this movie so I could make a legitimate critique of it, and as with Pirates of the Caribbean, I just don't even know exactly how I feel about it. It is a great movie in concept. Seeing a heroine on screen is definitely a plus, because prior to this I've been pretty much stuck enjoying Black Widow's epic (not that that's a bad thing). I thought some parts of the film were superbly done, I really enjoyed the scene with the Amazons taking on the Germans on the beach, I enjoyed the No Mans Land scene and followup scenes in the village. Gal's acting in the role was excellent and spot on, with enough playful mystique mixed with genuine badass to make it a convincing role..


But I'm sorry guys, this movie just doesn't really take the cake. A lot of critics and people I know are lauding this as absolutely the best DC film to ever come out... It may be the best DCEU film so far, but that's not really saying a whole lot. Nolan's Batman trilogy blows every DCEU film, including this one, out of the water. This film tried to add a counterbalance to the criticisms that BvS received as being too dark and trying too hard for grittiness, but in much the same way, it went overboard with its ""love saves the world"" message and crap. Diana might as well have fired a fucking Carebear beam at Ares at the climax, the conflict between them felt forced and cheesy, and at the end I was left underwhelmed. For a movie that was touted as being the innovative film of the year and such a breath of fresh air, it felt very formulaic. I try not to ""fanboy"" for either franchise over the other since I love elements from both Marvel and DC, but I feel like if Marvel can just stick the landing with SpiderMan: Homecoming and Thor: Ragnarok, they're gonna be taking home the trophies this year, unless Justice League turns out to be a complete surprise out of left field. 

tl;dr I can understand why so many people enjoy this movie due to placing a well known heroine at the center of the action and for the great scenes it does contain, but overall I felt the movie was just another superhero movie that didn't really do anything to distinguish itself from the pack aside from rely on a cheesy message of ""love conquers all"". Call me a cynic, but I like to have a bit more realism, even with my superhero movies...love doesn't always win the race and doesn't save everything. ",6erigc

Having already taken out Doomsday and the God of War, what is left to fight that requires a whole Justice League?  Dark Superman?  But I digress. 

After the movie was all said and done, I could not help but wonder what Diana did afterwards.  Like, during WWII.   Because if she were around, I think she would have clearly gone back to Germany and taken Hitler out. 

The best headcanon I can come up with is that after WWI ended, she went back to her home island to mourn the loss of Steve, and didn't leave until after WWII was done.   This would also set up Wonder Woman II to be a period spy movie (anywhere from the 50s to the 70s) about stopping a nuclear war. ",6erigc

dijvv70,"So, generally I thought it was a really solid film. Gadot/Pine and their travelling crew are well cast and for most scenes they are together are really well written.

I was pleasantly surprised at how thoughtful a film from this DC universe is. It takes a look at war as a big wide spectrum of intention - from the evil ludendorff to the glimpses of idealistic young soldiers to those in the middle who are jaded but still driven to save the world (Steve Trevor and his and Diana's group). And Steve's assertions that [with or without a ""God of War"", mankind is capable of evil without being controlled into it, but he himself was still willing to make any sacrifice to ensure the safety of others](#spoiler)
. Much like Diana, who herself has a lot to learn about our world, who will throw herself in harms way to protect the innocent.

Until the last 20-30 minutes, the film is structured so well. Aside from a couple of small extremely cheesy/hammy moments ([Ludendorff and Poison laughing after gassing that room? come on!](#spoiler) ), it's so good. The big showdown moment descends into BvS level of explody-fighty, jump cuts, not that it's terrible or anything (I thought it was handled somewhat better than the BvS final battle), it just feels shallow compared to the rest of the film to me.

All in all, I hope to see a sequel and would be happy if Jenkins came back to direct.",6erigc

I enjoyed many parts of it but there were some real WTF moments that took me out of the film.  The one that comes most to mind is that it is well established that Diana is super fast and can therefore fend off a hail of bullets with her wristbands and/or shield.  And while she does heal super-fast (we saw that on the island) she does bleed.  Why then does the last load of shrapnel that Ares hurls at her all bounce off some not-seen-before forcefield?  Are we supposed to believe that it was the power of her love for Steve manifesting to protect her (rather like Lily Potter's charm around Harry)?

die0l9p,"I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure it's worth all the hype it's getting and there were some glaring issues for me.

1.  The movie drags from the minute they leave the island until we see Wonder Woman emerge from the trench.  Another small action piece while in London would have helped.  

2.  Some of the closeup shots seemed detached from the scene they had just cut from.  For example, we see Wonder Woman standing atop the blown up bell tower and when they zoom in for a closeup, the background doesn't do a good job of matching what we were just looking at from afar.  It just looked fake, and like bad green screen.  

3.  There were other issues with the CGI when it came to the shots of Wonder Woman moving at super-human speeds.  On a few occasions, I was reminded of the Agent Smith battle in the second Matrix film and how out of place it looked when they mixed live shots with CGI.

4.  The final battle used way too much CGI.  It's like Patty was paying homage to Zach.

Gal is amazing as WW. She play the innocent part really well and never once looked stupid.

What I don't like:
Too much slo-mo and flips during fights. 
WW doesn't really have a strategy nor there were any stakes. She is way too OP for the soldiers especially when they only shoot at her shield. 
Boss fight is meh and dialog about ""I believe in love"" is beyond cheesy.

Other than that, I had average expectations from this film but wow. How can I not be shook from how much heart this film had?

There were moments when I found Gal's acting a little mediocre, or the CGI a little not perfect, but after the film, just WOW. Gal Gadot IS Wonder Woman. When her brows furrow down right before battle, that's some legitimate warrior face going on there. Going through this thread took me to realise and appreciate her character development. How she can't save everyone: the way she wants to help every individual but gets scurried off to see the larger picture. It all goes back to full circle when Steve says ""I'll save the day. You save the world."" 


GDI THATS SOME REALLY UGLY TEARS THERE

It didnt help that that muted scene when WW is momentarily deafened as Steve tells her about his plan. That did so many things to my emotions.

Chris Pine really brought just as much heart to this film as Gal Gadot did as Wonder Woman. I almost felt scared for his career prior to the film's release back when BvS was getting polarised reviews. But boy was I wrong. I will really miss Steve Trevor. Shit got real for me at that self-sacrifice thing. Because it was also a pivotal point I believe for WW to start considering the larger picture about saving the world and not just the individual. 

And also Robin freaking Wright. How badass was she at the beginning?? JENNNAAYYYYYY

And the combat scenes were gloriously done. I daresay it's a fresh way of filming combat: that whole jumping and twisting midair as the camera pans around bottom-wise (really bad description but) empowers me.

The film doesn't necessarily hype me up for Justice League, but I will b rewatching WW again for sure.

dick8ao,"The good:

- The action scenes! The No-Mans-Land scene in particular was completely badass. 
- Diana's journey from a naive, principled outsider to a jaded but still idealistic hero was super believable and well developed in my opinion. Gal did an excellent job with this.
- Pines's Steve Trevor was fantastic.
- Etta Candy.
- The story was cohesive, emotional, lovely, exciting.
- YOUNG DIANA.
- Pretty close to 0% of the third act was in the trailers at all.

The bad:

- Some of the CGI - woof.
- The supporting cast was a little underutilized. I liked them all but I felt Charlie and the Chief in particular were just sort of there. Charlie didn't even fire a shot, despite being the 'expert marksman'. They sort-of-but-not-enough addressed this.
- Not enough Etta Candy.
- The frame story felt the teeniest bit clumsy, but I'm not totally sure why I feel this way, because I do think it was necessary.

I am, full disclosure, a DC comics fanatic and particularly a Wonder Woman fanatic. I sobbed through any parts of the film that were even tangentially emotional. But I still recognize the DCEU for what it is - fledgling, and not always on the mark. I did like BvS, but the Ultimate Edition improved the movie tenfold. I thought Suicide Squad was a hot pile of garbage. So I'm definitely biased, but I hope I'm realistic:

Wonder Woman felt fresh. It was optimism and realism rolled together, it had plenty of excitement and stakes. I loved that the villain (Ares), while maybe a tiny bit underwhelming, was not the actual villain - man and man's flaws were the real antagonist, and Diana had to realize that it even existed before she could rise up against it. I enjoyed it very much. 5/7",6erigc
dicoo06,"Undoubtably the best DC movie since the Dark Knight trilogy. 

Really. This can be a redeeming force for DC if they keep it up.

To be specific, I wasn't a fan of BvS and especially disliked Suicide Squad. This made me pretty wary going into the movie. In fact, I checked the reviews to get a good idea of what I was going into. I was surprised with the quality here. 

The tone was spot on. It was fun, yet could be serious when it wanted to be. One of my main issues with BvS was with how broody it was. I understand DC wants to be darker/different from Marvel, that's fine. The overly political, dreary atmosphere isn't exactly inviting to me though. Wonder Woman was my only favorite part of that movie, because she was fun. I had other issues as well, but I'm not doing a full review here. 

Before you send me to the gallows, I realize that tonal direction is changing or at least being addressed. Suicide Squad went more in that direction, but my issues were with other aspects of the movie. The plot was pretty generic, and the characters weren't all that likable to me. I wasn't trying to hate it either. I'm not a Marvel fanboy, and I actually had issues with some of their movies too (including GOTG2). 

The characters in Wonder Woman seemed a lot more fleshed out, and real. Steve and his squad were great. The love dynamic between [Steve and Diana](#spoiler) didn't feel forced. I saw it coming, but it didn't bother me in the slightest. I felt there was a natural progression.

Plot wise, it was pretty straight forward. I'll admit that. The story focuses mainly on the journey to finding [Ares](#spoiler). I appreciate that [Ares](#spoiler) wasn't obvious too. His motivations seemed pretty clear, yet not hamfisted. 

Overall, I enjoyed this movie. It took a bit for me to get past my DC skepticism, I admit, but it is something I'd definitely watch again. There were a few things that I noticed, and couldn't help but question (they didn't affect my overall enjoyment, however).

- Why is Themyscira only shielded by a fog cloud. How did no one else stumble upon it before?

- Why did it take years for Diana's secret training to be found out by her mother? 

- Why did it take years for Diana to figure out her super strength? I feel like that would be figured out relatively quickly. 

Anyways, I'm looking forward to future DC movies now. I'm hoping Justice League turns out well. ",6erigc

Nobody among the Germans is seen to miss Luddendorf after his death, nor does Sir Patrick's death mark anything to Britain.

I have no idea how to critique movies so I am just gonna have some sort of stream of consciousness comment.

djw7dn0,"I thought the movie was good. The first half was awesome but the second was meh. The beginning has a lot of cool dynamics between Wonder Woman and Steve. Lots of funny moments where WW was acting a certain way or discussing a certain thing that was clearly not normal in everyday society and while they were funny they never felt childish

 [that moment on the boat when Wonder Woman expressed she knew what sex was and the fake out over the watch in the beginning were great](#spoiler)

The second part of the movie got into the differences between Wonder Woman's view on the war and Steve and led to some tension that felt like it dragged on too long and it was a bit obvious what they were going to do.

WW's actress was so good it never felt like I was Wonder Woman being played by a good actress, it felt like I was watching Wonder Woman. She had a sense of maturity and class while still coming off as naive or ignorant about the outside world. Every mannerism screamed ""Strong, Independant Woman"" without feeling like it took effort.

Steve did his job of grounding the experience for the viewer while still being charming, funny, helpful (hard to do when you're next to a superhero but he made it believable) and selfless.

[His sacrifice at the end where he held out the gun and took a few moments to accept his fate hit me right in the feels](#spoiler)

The combat was great. I loved seeing her jumping, running, and hitting at superhuman levels. Some of the slow-mo was overbearing but not enough to ruin the action. Few cuts during fight sequences too which is always a plus.

One of my main gripes about the film is a spoiler but it's a small one: [Why does every male and female lead have to have sex or become an item without any compelling romance or build? Steve and WW go from mutual friends/benefactors to a fight scene to getting it on. I liked how subtle the sex scene was but still, it felt thrown in.](#spoiler)

dignl1i,"*Wonder Woman* isn't perfect, but in my opinion it doesn't need to be. Sure there is some questionable CGI and underdeveloped villains, but none of those things significantly detract from the movie. 

I'm not as big of a fan of the superhero genre as I used to be. I think the genre has gotten too saturated with action-packed sequences that leave little room to develop the characters. We tend to root for the hero simply *because* he is our hero and that's what we're supposed to do, not necessarily because they are complex or relatable. 

This is probably why I enjoyed Wonder Woman so much (and movies like The Dark Knight). It's the superhero movie I wish more superhero movies could be. It's straightforward but also far more emotional. Even though it has humor, it isn't constant, and when something emotional does happen they don't make light of it. It takes its time to develop complex, multi-layered characters instead of forcing their interactions around a single plot. Most compelling of all, it makes me actually care for them because their faltered understanding of the world resonates with me. It feels authentic, emotional, and compelling.",6erigc

I was surprised by Gal's performance... I was underwhelmed with her acting in BvS but it seems like she fit the role of Diana/WW pretty well... Chris Pine also did well (no surprise there), but other than that there weren't any characters/actors that really stood out to me or had me really care about their motivations/well-being.


The villains were kinda lame.... [Dr. Poison was boring and timid.... I'm not familiar with the comics so I don't know if she's an original villain for this movie or whatever but when I saw the trailers I was expecting a badass lady mad scientist crossed with Phantom of the Opera... instead we got a timid girl with no backstory... I wanted to know what happened to her face... was it an experiment gone wrong? Maybe they addressed this in the movie and I missed it.](#spoiler) 


[The general guy.. can't even remember his name... cliche war bad-guy, nothing really interesting about his character... I didn't get the whole sniffing-vapors-to-turn-into-a-berserker thing, but he reminded me of one of the villains in Jessica Jones.](#spoiler)


[The Ares reveal was underwhelming... I get what they were going for in casting a guy you wouldn't expect, but rather than have him change into a more suitable actor for the big fight they covered him up in shitty CGI armor like we would forget the god of war himself is being played by Remus Lupin.](#spoiler)


Lastly, I think some of the scenes toward the end were too dark and I had a hard time making out what was going on... maybe it was my TV or I should've turned down the lights more, but nearly every movie I've seen with Zack Snyder involved has this problem.

Patty Jenkins did a fantastic job with the movie and it showed that she really had much respect for the source material. Having Geoff Johns on DCEU now is fantastic and you know he will be there to make sure these movies do their source justice.

Patty nailed the fish out of water dynamic after reaching London and the movie successfully hit every note it was aiming for. Also, I enjoyed how small the stage felt whilst having stakes feel important. E.g. saving the village across No Man's Land. Which, can I just say, No Man's Land? The buildup to that scene was a bit on the nose, wasn't it? ""No man's land... meaning no MAN can cross it!"" 

All that being said, the third act was a bit of a mess. Not to say I didn't see it coming with the War of the Gods backstory in the beginning.. but the second Ares says she's a god POOF she can stop lightning and love beam it from her chest. Idk. Underdeveloped villains and the power of Love just kindof makes me rolls my eyes at this point.

It shows that in order to be strong or a fighter it doesn’t mean u have to lose the feminine part of you.

Action wasn't that great for me either. And for all the praise the film is getting for not objectifying women, damn, WW is damn HOT in her skin tight outfit. End was anti climactic for me as well. Film was slightly too long, with the character exposition that really wasn't necessary (e.g., side characters). The twist didn't move me as well.

The side characters (the thief, sniper and old Native guy) were really ugly holes on the mostly beautifully put together story. Never saw the sniper shoot, or the other guys show off in any way. Actions scenes were misty kickass, but I wish they had been a little more subtle at times rather than almost all front profile shots made to look like movie posters all the time. Score could've been done better at a lot of parts (needs more Hans Zimmer). However, compared to the other D.C. movies, this one is no comparison. The themes were inserted very well. Displaying her heroism outside of fighting and creating an actual back story was very welcome.

I didn't like how they used the trope of having a loved one die in the beginning to give Diana her will to fight, also that death scene was lazy af ""You are...the...chosen...one..."" or whatever she said.

I had David Thewlis pegged for the surprise reveal bad guy pretty much instantly, his performance as Ares was good and the last battle between him and Diana was one of the strongest scenes in the movie.

Lots of people saying they were disappointed by Ares. I was actually glad they had a different take on the stereotypical ""GOD OF WAR!!!"" type character we tend to think of. The actor nailed it.  

His ""final combat form"" was kind of disappointing from a purely aesthetic standpoint, but I think that's less a design problem, and more a problem of how to deal with invincible god characters. We tend to see the same kind of problem with Superman. When the combatants are basically indestructible, it's hard to make it feel like the fight has real stakes. It's also difficult to do much more than have them jump around, move fast, and punch each other really hard. ",6erigc
didx5fw,"Going through this movie one more time, I can definitely say it's the technical things that  bring this movie down for me, from being great to being average.

The charcter scenes are beautiful and Diana is wonderful, Steve is just plain human and good and hell having great characters is probably all I need for movies to be great.

But the movie is bogged down by lazy editing (example: The warship from the beginning of the movie)

The action scenes have too many jump cuts and slo-mo and zooming in on Diana's face where it's really hard sometimes to tell what the hell is happening. The CGI is really obvious where the characters and enemies take on this rag doll/Mortal Kombat aesthetic. 

The third act doesn't help because it stuffs all these problems at the same time. 

Yes Diana and Steve are awesome, the plot is pretty generic but it's the characters that hold this movie up.

It's a 6.5/10 for me. It's not a bad movie but I can't look away and excuse the technical issues especially when it's not really a nitpick and its just right there staring at me.

The action was entertaining, the humor was sprinkled in areas that it worked and totally left out in areas it didn't, and was everything I hoped it was going to be.

Compared to DCs offerings, this was the first DC movie since Rises that actually made an effort to make you give a shit about its characters. The movie isn't set piece after set piece, with scenes inbetween only serving to move to next set piece, rather there are slower character moments that humanize these titans and the people they effect. 

I can't think of a single fucking scene in BvS especially where two characters have dialogue that isn't for the purposes of advancing the plot except maybe the Senator meeting with Lex, which was horrible simply because of Eisenbergs performance. There was no character building.

Hell, the only time D.C. tried doing that was with El Diablo in SS, in the bar when he was talking about how he killed his family, and this being the impetus to swearing off using his powers to harm. That was humanizing and tragic. Seriously, fucking El Diablo the Fire Mayan was to me the best written DCMU character, and he wasn't even great outside of that scene.

I love this movie. I love the action, the acting which felt incredibly natural, the characters, and especially the fact that this finally had well fleshed out characters.",6erigc
diehbdz,"I really really liked the film but I can't help but feel the big climactic finale left me disappointed and kept the movie from being truly great. Even with the heavy exposition the first half was so intriguing and it was capped off by the enthralling no man's land scene. After that point I can't help but feel the movie waned more and more until it ended. I don't mind the inclusion of Ares but it just turned into another mess that was more akin to BvS rather the the earlier portions of the movie. The only high point of the finale to me was probably Steve's sacrifice.

Speaking of Steve, Chris Pine was the absolute anchor of this movie. Charisma and comedy all in one. Gal was very good as well but she is noticeably less when the two aren't bouncing off each other. I'm not saying she is bad though. I was on the fence regarding her but she carried herself well. Overall it was just so nice to have a cast that is actually likable in one of these DC movies.

I very much hope that DC is finally pulling its film division together but I will still withhold my judgment until after Justice League.",6erigc

dicpsyt,"Let me preface this by saying that I'm a huge feminist and god-fucking-damn, i feel like i've been waiting my whole life for a movie like this. Gal Gadot was fierce, naive, conflicted and beautiful. She IS Wonder Woman. I couldn't tear my eyes away during the No Man's Land scene. Chris Pine was fantastic and his scenes with Gal were so charming. The way they did Steve Trevor was just perfect and I'm actually gutted that they killed him off. I mean it was great but also their chemistry was so fun to watch. 

I mean it's by no mean's a perfect movie (the third act is a little too much but it still had some standout moments. I loved the scene where Diana is freaking out and Steve is trying to explain something complex to her in like 30 seconds and you can feel just how difficult it is for both of them) but it's hard to explain just how amazing it feels to see a woman superhero solo movie that's not a garbage fire (looking at you Catwoman and Elektra). 

Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot created something that I'm definitely willing to throw my money at. 

Edit: I forgot to add that I caught a session which was the first feasible post-school session and the amount of teenage girls in the cinema who cheered and gasped and were just all round into the movie warmed the cockles of my cold, bitter heart. Not to mention, the teenage boys as well. And I truly hope it gets more girls into comic books but there's some fantastic role models in there. ",6erigc

Overall, this was a great movie and I'm glad DC is back on track (or rather finally on track for the first time).",6erigc

diqr5mb,"I didnt like it as much as some people here did. I cant help but feel the huge praise this film gets is due to the fact it isnt filled with huge plot issues and execution like BvS and SS, and that its a strong female lead. The movie to me felt so much like ""been there, done that"" it was really just the first Captain America 1 (Chris Pine's character arc finishes the exact same way almost scene identical to Steve Rogers, airplane and all.) and Thor 1 had a baby. Is that a bad thing? Im not sure, but it didnt feel like anything new to me. 

I also felt the casting choice for Ares was absolutely horrendous. The top comments here poke fun at it, but its more terrible than just taking a jab at it and moving on. That was such a bad choice. 

The movie really rushed the ""good in humans vs the bad in them"" conflict at the end, and I felt the dialogue during that confrontation was really poorly done. ""HUMANS ARE CAPABLE OF LOVE!!"" Or whatever she said that really made me cringe.

As for the good:

The soundtrack is incredible

The fight scenes were incredible

The acting was top notch from Gal Gadot and Chris Pine.

diwe0ix,"Alright, I'm going to get into this even though I really didn't want to because I feel like I'm a bit nutty.

The movie was a hard 5/10.

Let me explain before people get mad.

The movie felt like the writer/director were making a lego set and following the directions to a T, just taking the framework for a superhero movie and building everything as the directions say.  It was predictable and felt very stale, the movie was built on one tired old superhero cliche after another, a very typical, bit boring origin story.

The CGI was very meh, it was very noticeable and really took me out of the movie.

The final boss battle was ridiculous and really took away from the movie, if they'd left it after she'd killed Ludendorff it would have been fantastic, the realization that it wasn't some mythical power controlling all these people, just the evil of people was fantastic, I loved that particular scene, it was over so fast, she took him out so swiftly and it felt powerful and meaningful.  It was different and intriguing and truly made me forget how meh the rest of the movie was...and then they ruined it all by going back to the tired old cookie cutter method of having a horribly predictable twist in the film where the guy we all thought was good is bad OH NO.  I knew he was Ares the minute he offered to aid them earlier in the film.

One of the main characters sacrificing themselves heroically at the end of the movie to thwart a rather over the top, convoluted baddies plan.  Leave's a bad taste in all the viewers mouths.

I honestly felt I'd seen this movie before, it felt bland, predictable and overall very disappointing.

There were a few redeeming scenes but honestly not enough to justify the rave reviews this movie is getting, I went in expecting something fresh and new with the way people were talking about it and I just felt thoroughly disappointed, I was really excited about this movie going in.

I will say I liked Gadot as Wonder Woman and Chris Pine was as Chris Pine-y as ever.

Also, I feel like what running is to Tom Cruise, motorcycles are to Chris Pine, which I like.

Have to say Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot literally tore the house down with this one. 

No Man's Land 🙌",6erigc
dieemmk,"Ever wondered what Captain America: The First Avenger would had been like if directed by Sam Raimi? Wonder Woman is your answer. Patty Jenkins brings the age-old hero into the modern world by telling an anti-war story with superheroes. Wonder Woman follows Diana, Princess of Themyscira, in a self-reflecting journey to seek out the cause of man's love for warfare. Her journey begins when Steve Trevor crashes onto Diana's peaceful island after being chased by a battalion. From this encounter, Diana is introduced to the perils of war and she breaks her people's isolationist culture to destroy the source of the war, Ares. Her endeavors include a myriad of characters and takes her from London to Belgium. The story invokes the first Captain America film but the horrors of war portrayed in Wonder Woman are less fantastical. The film becomes predictable once the viewer has been familiarized with the characters, which made the final twist unsurprising. Strange enough, the build up to that reveal is nowhere to be seen within the first half of the film. The viewer would know thanks to the character's traits and not actions.

Patty Jenkins did a great job in directing the film and her passion could be felt. The acting felt underwhelming in comparison. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine carry the film but the cast's acting, including the aforementioned, felt stilted at times. The cinematography and music were on par too. However, some tracks felt out of placed as triumphal music would play suddenly after an emotional bout. That led to a quick change in the film's tone, which felt off. 

One nitpick with this film is DC's use of Batman. The film begins and ends with Batman. Wonder Woman is apart of DC's Trinity. She should be able to carry this movie herself. How many seats DC expects to sell through Batman cameos is unknown but the studio should have had faith in the character herself. 

Overall, Wonder Woman is a great film and it's worth seeing in theatres. Patty Jenkins breathed new life into DC and resuscitated the comic book company's movie universe.  ",6erigc
dif10ms,"They had me right until the last ten minutes. The whole Ares reveal/fight/monologue just didn't do it for me. Especially because it turned out that the answer is love and that she had the power inside of her the whole time. She just had to believe. 

Also, the ""I love you, but I have to fly a plane for reasons that don't add up if you really think about it, k bye."" scene was less than I was hoping for. I don't think he needed to say I love you. It was a step too far. 

And one more thing. What the hell are her powers?! Can she fly? Is she super strong? Is she a god? What the fuck was that sword good for? What do her gauntlets do? Is she bullet proof? Why was the monster in BvS so difficult for a woman who killed Ares with the power of electric-love? Why is she jumping off the Louve?

dj5n49h,"During the middle of the movie, shortly after they conquered no man's land they were talking about life after war (marriage, settling down and having children and all that beautiful stuff) it was at this point i was sold on their love/chemistry and genuinely believed that they were going to get married and have that generic story( the moral dies and the immortal lives, something like captain America) but it hit me when I realised that Steve was going to sacrifice himself I started tearing it really hit me in the feels. What was more heartbreaking and tear jerking was Diana couldn't hear his last words to her. Even rewatching that particular scene I cried even more.  

The background music was so fitting during the midst of the chaos everything just came to a stop. The part when Diana was going to kill doctor poison while Ares was convincing her, the intense music completely stopped and played the emotional soundtrack, she finally remembers what he said, ""I wished we could have spent more time, I love you"" that hit the nail on The Coffin I was bawling at this point. It felt so real.

The very very last scene where the british celebrated after war, couples kissing and cheering i couldnt help but think that this could have been them...(cried again) 

Though the first part of the movie was confusing due to Diana being naive, the last part of the movie literally put me on an emotional rollercoaster, I was feeling the emotions even 4 days after.
Never have I ever cried so much during a movie before, I only teared during Yandu's death but for Wonder Woman I was literally bawling.

The music really stood out to me. It was just so good. Everytime it played, all I could think was how well it suits the scene. The use of almost silence was well done. 



Acting was terrific. Gal really did an amazing job. Her innocence, simplicity and, losing and regaining faith in mankind really came across. 
This was typical Chris Pine role in my books and he was the perfect choice. He plays the heartthrob; charming good guy roles well but they really needed someone who can do that while not make the character feel like every other morally correct character. His sacrifice really had an impact. Chris really nailed the helpless yet faith in ending the war scene well. 
The villains were great. I don't need to even mention it. The bad guys were the bad guys they knew what they had to do and they did it exceptionally well. 



The story was simple to the point and the thing a war story like this needed was a heart. This movie has enough of it. War stories are a bit simple to align your morals with but the struggles while everyone knows are still tough to showcase. Patty did and amazing job. 


All in all easy 8.3/10 for me.

difajto,"Just came back from watching this movie. I was a little skeptical of Gal Godot purely from a physical perspective, but her physicality in the movie was definitely more than enough for the role of WW.

Some say they're put off by her accent, but I thought the accent was perfect in lending more credibility to the theme that WW is literally some sort of a foreigner in the world of modern man.

A lot of good action scenes! My favorite fight scene was the front line sequence into the storming of the town. [The Ares fight scene was good, but I would have preferred something more visceral and fisticuffy than the lightning-based finishing strike.

The casting of the two leads was note-perfect, and Gal Gadot is able to create a character who is perhaps naive but not stupid, and make her charming and also relatable, which is not something every actress could pull off. She and Chris Pine have wonderful chemistry and he makes a great foil for her as the more pragmatic Steve Trevor.
",6erigc
diipp3j,"I am feeling conflicted on this movie. On the one hand I enjoyed the time I spent in the theater, really like Gadot and Pine, thought the action and comedy scenes were well done, enjoyed the cinematography choices, and felt real emotional attachment to some of the more moving scenes. It was a good, entertaining movie, but another part of me is extremely frustrated that it wasn't better.

I will save my plot/story issues for the last part.

* I was really bugged by the time it took for them to travel places. Themiscyra is presumably in the Aegean Sea. I presume Trevor didn't have time to fly his plane all that far if boats were in close pursuit of him, so it isn't all the far from the coast of Turkey. A sailboat can't get to England in a day from there. Neither can a tugboat. I also had a problem believing they could get to the front so quickly. These silly time jumps and ticking clock just took me out of the story temporarily, and didn't do anything to add to my experience.

* On a similar note, the lack of guards once they were behind enemy lines was kind of annoying. Them making a giant bonfire to send smoke signals is hardly a subtle way of alerting Trevor and Diana.

* The disappearing German destroyer. Shows up, fires some rounds, then just disappears. That was strange. Another thing that just distracts me from what is going on.

* How did the Amazons become masters of so many languages if they haven't had contact with the outside world? The love languages have only developed in the last 1500 years or so. 

* Bit of a hot take here, but I think women tend to have problems with action scenes. I have seen people criticizing the use of slow motion, but I much prefer that to using multiple cuts in a single punch. I actually think the background Amazons looked damn good in the fight scenes, and were probably cast based on their ability to fight well, but Gadot doesn't always have the proper looking weight and power behind some her movements during real time. 

I admit, many of these things could probably explained without too much effort, but would needlessly extend the length of the film. Just slight annoyances that I would overlook if I didn't have issues with some of the story decisions.

A decent amount of my gripes have to do with the previous DC movies. The characterization of Diana doesn't really gel with what we saw in BvS, or really explain why she wouldn't show up when Zod is trying to end the Earth. I will try and start chronologically, though. 

We are never given any reason why Diana isn't better informed on the world or her parentage. One reason may be they are afraid of drawing Ares' attention, but they also seem to be unsure if Ares is even alive. For being a warrior culture they seem to be heavily governed by fear. Afraid of Diana reaching her potential, afraid of facing Ares, afraid of dealing with the outside world. I'm sure there is more to the Island than we learned, but based off what we know right now it doesn't make much sense to me. I think things would have been better if the Amazons were just billed as Protectors, and it was never specified what they were protecting. Diana would be kept in the dark as to what specifically they were Protectors of because she hasn't earned her place as an Amazon warrior never having been in combat. To keep the beach scene from qualifying as combat I would have liked the Amazons to just laughably face roll over the German soldiers, thus the only way that Diana could become an Amazon would be to leave the Island and find real combat, but in so doing be banished from returning. A fun catch-22. This would also make Diana returning to the Island an excellent plot point for a sequel. 

As far as story goes for the middle part of the movie I didn't have too many issues, but did think it didn't flesh out the major theme of a morally grey world as well as it could have. I would have liked the squad to be fleshed out a bit more, but feel like that was another time constraint issue. Chief being more about money than anything, Trevor's people being conquerors, Charlie turning into a coward because of his experiences, and Sameer's deceptiveness could have been shown having a bigger impact on Diana's understanding of the world. I think she should have been slower to warm up to them. Basically, they should have had to do something to earn her respect, showing that first impressions don't mean everything and people can be complicated. I also would have liked the movie to probably go in an R-rated direction on the leaving the trenches scene. The fact that not a single ""good"" guy died didn't help to drive home the message that war is hell. I will get into this more in my last section, but I would have preferred the Brits making a charge without Diana leading the way, only for her, after yelling at the commander blowing the whistle for not going over with his soldiers, does her thing and overruns the position. I also wish that the woman that told Diana her people were being enslaved was talking about how the British were the ones being the culprits. In general, I don't think there was enough grey shown during the movie. The Germans never really got to show any bravery, and the Brits never showed any ugliness. Finally, I wish that Dr. Poison's motivations and character had been fleshed out a bit more. Generally speaking, men seem to be the embodiment of all bad things in the world. Making it more 'all humans are capable of good and evil' would have helped.

Now the finale of the movie, this seems to be the part that people found the weakest, and I can't disagree with that. I probably would have done away with the whole infiltrating the party scene. Diana ignoring Trevor's urging to focus on the mission instead of helping overtake the German's position results in them being late to the party, and all they see is the artillery shells being launched. They rush back to the village, and Diana has to come to grips with fact that her saving those people still ended up with them dying in the end, while Trevor gets to explain that sometimes you have to make decisions for the greater good. Ends up with a powerful bonding moment between the two where Diana finally understands the sacrifices that Trevor has made throughout the war. I would have done the chemical weapons factory raid completely differently. I will start off with I have no idea why Trevor blew himself up. For one thing, I thought I saw them put a timed bomb on the plane earlier. Two, having a Hydrogen based gas makes no sense since it will rise, if it is detonated while in a plane it won't affect anyone. Three, Trevor could have just flown the plane to a friendly airfield, and given the allies the ultimate trump card in negotiating a surrender of the German alliance. His sacrifice was moving, but made no sense to me. How I would change things. Starts very similar, but they are working as a team instead of Diana going in solo to start. She kills the general, moment of revelation that wasn't Ares, sees Trevor pinned down and in need of help. Comes to the rescue and they board the plane together. Proceed to fly to London, both are happy that they have diverted the killing of millions. Once they land David Thewlis is there to congratulate them, now the difference here is that the war isn't days away from ending, more like right when the Americans are entering the war. Thewlis had been the only one advocating for peace, but now he all of a sudden sees this as a chance to completely wipe out the German alliance. Trevor and Diana are both shocked and refuse to go along with this genocide. Thewlis starts talking about the new lands that he will be able to give out to those loyal to him, sort of typical evil-tycoon guy. Diana and Trevor get ready to fight him when mysterious black shadow materializes behind Thewlis and stabs him in the back. Faceless, red-eyed Ares manifests. Starts talking about how he thrives off conflict. He doesn't want the end of humans, he needs the constant conflict to survive. The gas in the hands of the Germans would have extended the war another decade, but he can't let the Allies get such an upper hand in the war. Diana finds out about her parentage, and tries to reconcile with why she was lied to by her mother. Decides she doesn't accept it and tries to fight Ares, easily defeated and thrown back. Trevor tries to save Diana by blowing himself and the gas up on Ares. Ares unfazed by the explosion. Diana discovers her powers forces him to retreat. Ominous, ""Live with the humans and tell me I'm wrong, sister"" from Ares as he fades away. Ends in the bar with the rest of the companions and a picture of Trevor. A newsboy advertises a headline about the Americans making way along the front, but the war still has no clear end in sight. Diana is unsure of her place in the world now. Humanity doesn't need protection from Ares, it is its own worst enemy. Leads to her just trying to blend in with society and trying to better understand humanity.

Much darker, but fits better with why she has been absent for the last century. ",6erigc
dikc57p,"I'm glad Zack Snyder didn't direct this movie. Sure he had a bit of an impression, but WW was way better than Man of Steel and BvS. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and everything was awesome! The only opportunity they missed out on however was more character development and deeper drama. I don't know how she learns what love is in just three days, and I don't understand the abilities and limitations of Wonder Woman. I understand, however, that those things take time and one movie isn't enough.

Last thing: Can these D.C. Movies stop having their final battle scenes at night time?",6erigc
dilrzkr,"I liked it. It's not the greatest film ever made, and it has a bunch of problems, most notably the villains, the entire third act, and the way the film seems to be missing some connective tissue in action scenes, but it's a good introduction of Diana, Steve Trevor has good chemistry and is an asset rather than a character that exists to make Diana look good by highlighting his incompetence, and it's the first DCEU movie that seems to want to tell a coherent story rather than tease sequels, chase The Dark Knight's shadow, or foam at the mouth and wet itself. It's a solid ""Phase One"" kind of movie, and I'd put it up there between Thor and Iron Man, but not quite at the level of First Avenger.

My biggest gripes are in the origin/backstory:

[I prefer the clay baby origin. It's classic Greek weirdness and makes Diana completely separate from Man, and presents a more interesting dynamic between her and the gods as a worshiper who still puts the gods in their places every now and then, rather than a demigod who's participating in a family squabble.](#spoiler)

[On that note, the whole ""All the gods are dead"" angle is a bad one to me, because it robs the universe of a lot of the weirdness I was hoping Diana would bring to the table. Rather than opening a bunch of doors for craziness, the origin story removes the chance for them to make the world more boring.](#spoiler)

I think it's a good movie, and it's the first non-MCU superhero movie since The Dark Knight I'd be willing to pay to see again in theaters. Strong start and I hope that it actually is a sign of WB getting its act together.",6erigc
dinl5ls,"Just came back from the theatre and I have to say, I absolutely loved it. I was afraid Reddit and DC would let me down again after building up so much hype but you didn't disappoint! My only grip about the movie is that some parts felt a little long, the excessive amount of slow motion in the battles, the CGI in some places and some parts in the final battle where it seemed Ares became a generic Marvel villain. 

Chris Pine absolutely killed it as Steve and I was sad to see him go. The end speech he gave to Diana about how humanity is extremely flawed really hit me in the feels. Also their chemistry was super great! 

Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman in this movie, 'nuff said. Her characterization was on point. 

No Man's Land was beautiful and inspirational.

The Amazonian scenes had me tense the whole scene.

I'll give this a 8/10. :D (for the two villains having that laugh together and Ares still having that mustache in the flashback xD that was gold)",6erigc
dinn5ja,"What I liked: emotionally engaging, character driven, beautifully acted, and well-paced with dazzling action scenes. 

What I didn't like: the final battle was the part that felt closest to ""cliche superhero movie finale."" Even so I really liked the Ares character and the end of Steve's storyline. At least the battle didn't overstay it's welcome either.

All in all I thought this was a truly great superhero movie, striking a great balance between escapism and emotional impact. It showed you can make a superhero movie with a lot of intense and serious themes while still including a lot of joy and heart.",6erigc
dinrzod,"I won't reiterate most of the things that were already said - I agree with almost all of it.
However, I've noticed that a lot of people have an issue with WW defeating Ares with the power of love.

I didn't get that at all? She literally took all of his lighting blasts, absorbed them into her bracelets and then blew a hole in his chest with the same lightning. Am I wrong?",6erigc
dipo0c0,"Really, really enjoyed the film. Good action sequences, investment in the characters, and, unlike all the other DC films, the pacing was much, much better. Basic storytelling structures were actually there.

djedrzk,"I thought it was a good film over all, yes there are problems. Gal Gadot is a great wonder woman, and was happy she got her own film. It connected to me as a comic fan of DC , but I felt it was not geared towards me. More towards females who need a hero or person to look too. A female friend of mine tsgged along and she got alot out of the movie than me. I cant recall the last female lead in a comic movie to be honest. Wonder Woman is a great edtion to the DC movies and cant wait to see more. Take your sister, mom, gf, or wife out to this movie and enjoy.",6erigc
djo0rgy,"I left WW having enjoyed it enough to look forward to a sequel, which is a fairly good induction I suppose.

I do have gripes with Ares, in that once he was revealed they could have changed the actor or made him a little more abstract. 

I was also a little disappointed in the obligatory love interest plot, it'd be nice to have more films where the male and female leads don't fall in love with each other, but that's fairly minor as far as complaints go. ",6erigc
djpdv36,"I might be crazy here but was anyone else waiting for a reveal of who WW's father would be? The obvious answer would be Zeus but I felt having Ares be her father would have added to the movie.
It would definitely add to her needing to see the world more grey instead of black and white. 

Making the aunt could be her actual mom could have stepped it up. But even if the queen got into bed with Ares that still does the job.

If this was rated R you could imply he raped her. I thought thats where it was going when the mom kept saying ""dont tell her."" 


Anyways agree with what others said about the final battle being cheesy and a cgi mess. I actually feel like her scenes against DD in BvS were a lot better. I wanted to see a brawl between her and Ares, a real back and forth battle, instead it felt like a harry potter magic fight with them just throwing shit at each other.


Another thing I would have changed is have WW interact with Dr. Poison at the end somehow. 


Anyways didn't like that WW is presented as a weapon.. So yeah...

Just for clarity when WW is wrapped up and shes remembering Chris Pine does she hear what he says, or is the scene showing the audience what he said. 


Thats my thoughts for now.

dk5kxcf,"Very good movie but it felt rushed, I don't know why studios don't want to make Ben-Hur-esque long  movies (budget? revenue? policy?), this plot had like 2 or more hours to give about war and storyline but in the end it felt like ""Ok guys we are running out of time so better make this quick"" it's a shame, aside for a few minor plot inconsistencies it is a very entertaining movie, it's dialogue has some of gold lines and wonder woman makes some interesting questions, often Steve couldn't give a damn reason so he just say because ""you can't"", also the slow motion action was amazing, you could carefully see how those amazing moves were realized, i really liked it.

dphj1te,"I mean I enjoyed it but it was way overrated for the praise it got. It was just a regular superhero movie with a female lead. Well ""lead"" because it felt like Chris Pine was the actual lead. I think he had more lines and was leading every scene while Gal was just the one to rush in and clean house.

And for a movie that was praised for feminism and a strong female lead I didn't feel that. Even when on the island full of women they kept talking about Ares and fearing him. Also, yes Diana is definitely a strong character physically but she is superhuman surrounded by normal men, so that's obvious. And she lived outside of modern culture her whole life and wasn't accustomed to women being beneath men. It's not like she was a normal woman that overcame prejudice and adversity to be on the same level as men.

That being said, I did enjoy this movie but felt like the ""feminism"" and hype was definitely overplayed in reviews.",6erigc

I guess I just feel, idk hollow(?) after the movie was over. After so many superhero movies there wasn't anything that really makes this one stand out from the crowd. 

I guess my thoughts are best summed up by saying if this is one of the best films we can expect from the DC extended universe, I'm not all that excited for future properties. ",6erigc
dicpyh0,"What I saw tonight was a combination of what I loved best about ""The Messenger"" and ""300"", all wrapped around my all-time favorite comic hero. 

I felt the exposition was a bit choppy (did we really need 3 Dianas?). I wanted SO MUCH MORE of the Amazons in battle. I am still craving more of Hippolyta and Antiope--Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright are simply hypnotic in their gorgeous fierceness. Having said that, I also know that I am sick to death of the ridiculous 'action' as I saw in ""Man of Steel"", so I am appreciative of Jenkins' more judicious approach. 

I thought Gal Gadot was rather wooden in BvS, but she was anything but flat here. Wonder Woman is idealistic, optimistic, passionate, compassionate, naïvely sweet, damn-near painfully sexy, and a total badass that doesn't take any crap from anybody. 

The chemistry with Chris Pine was absolutely amazing. The scene in the boat was simultaneously adorable and hilarious, yet racked with palpable sexual tension that made me want to run home to my husband. 

Once past Themyscira, the only woman in the film besides the Dr. Poison is Etta. I thought Lucy Davis was perfect here, and I was so glad to see that they didn't make her just a side-piece: we are allowed to see that she is attentive and clever in her small part.

At the end of the day, I think this movie just brought into sharp focus the fact that what I really want is a film of Steven Pressfield's ""Last of the Amazons"". I will joyfully watch this film until that day comes. 

If I think about techicalities, I give this about 8/10. If I am going with my heart, 10/10. Either way, I see a few long lunches in my immediate future while I pop out for a matinée. I saw it alone on the first go, and I can't wait to see it with friends. 

I could go on with criticisms and praise, but I've already written a wall of text. I'll sum up by saying I loved it and I hope it makes a bazillion dollars. 
",6erigc
dieb602,"I really enjoyed the movie, thought Gal Gadot was a perfect Diana, and am excited to see where they take the character. I need to say that to preface what I'm about to say, to put it in context as a small criticism of an otherwise great movie.

I think Diana's climactic realization of the ""power of love"" was a mistake. It didn't feel appropriate for at least two reasons. First, it's incredibly cliche, even for a summer blockbuster about a naive, sheltered princess. And they played it totally straight, no real twist or lampshading. Second, she doesn't actually defeat Ares with the power of love. She defeats him with the power of lightning and punches. At first I thought she was going to just stand there while he dashed himself to pieces against her, but nope, she beat the god of war by fighting him. It was just *really motivated* fighting. 

They really needed to do one of two things instead. Either they go all in on the love angle, making this epiphany the reason she hangs up her costume for a hundred years and tries to solve the world's problems as a peaceful ambassador. As soon as she realizes that all the fighting she did in the movie was just playing into Ares's hands, she refuses to fight him or anyone else and he destroys himself in rage as I outlined above. This could lead to emotional conflict in later movies as she struggles to resolve these two parts of her and figure out when fighting is OK. 

Or they strip out the love thing and use some other revelation to give her the climactic upper hand. For example, they already have a theme of human self-determination (""there is good and bad in everyone""). They could have built on that and made her fight be for freedom, giving everyone a chance to choose to be good. Then Steve Trevor could have been the ""bad boy"" who finally redeemed himself, inspiring her, instead of the damsel in distress who got fridged.

I know I wrote a big essay, here, but again I think most of the movie was great. This one thing didn't ruin it for me. I just think it could have been even better if that part of the plot made more sense.",6erigc
dig86ra,"I enjoyed it soooo much more than I thought I would. I don't tend to enjoy superhero movies beyond a ""That was ok I guess. I'm not mad I saw it. A fun 2 hours"" at best, but Wonder Woman actually managed to move me.

Like I seriously underestimated how cool it would be to see Robin Wright and all the Amazons kicking so much ass at the beginning, with baby Di being an adorable little war monger.

It had great set up and pay off, good pacing, characters were solid and all got arcs, ending was satisfying, action was expertly and engagingly shot, sympathetically directed with great framing. I didn't even have a problem with the third act that some people have mentioned. It may have relied a lot on cgi, but what superhero movies don't? It didn't have a portal in the sky that needed destroying!

So yeah, for a superhero movie, it is a fantastic one. Definitely one of the best solo origin stories by either Marvel or DC I'd say. Patty Jenkins done good and I couldn't be happier for it's success. It's sure been a long time coming.",6erigc
digalce,Steve was quite possibly the worst spy of all time.,6erigc
digu7l6,"Pretty solid movie for a origin, with the flock of Superhero movies coming in & out, this one kept me entertained more than the usual. Definitely above SS, BVS(not the extended cut), Iron Man 3, Iron Man 2, Thor 2 etc. Gal was a good choice, I thought she was great & convincing. I can also understand why some liked it more than others, this movie by all counts was the first of it's kind that came with alot of emotional empowerment for some. What I liked most about it was the humor & seriousness was brought out at appropriate times. Steve wasn't cracking one liners before sacrificing himself. Diana wasn't ripping a joke about every soldier as she was manhandling them in no man's land. Intense violence was treated as something serious which I liked. Themyscira was developed well, Connie as Queen Hippolyta was great.  Aesthetically, I expected Ares to be different. A muscled out, 6ft man with long black hair was what I pictured. When you hear God of War, you don't envision a older gentleman with a crowbar mustache. I really wanted more hand to hand combat for the final fight, not Ares flinging objects. But it's a origin, and things will progressively get better over time. For this being Wonder Woman's first major film, it was a good start. 

7.5/10 for me. ",6erigc

- Great cinematography (except for a few scenes)
- Gadot and Pine are an inspired combination

Cons

- Last thirty mins are pure schlock
- Some of the performances are pretty bad
- There were some scenes that were so bad I actually ended up laughing
- The villains were weak and flat as fuck
- Sometimes Diana crosses the fine line between being naive and being stupid and it gets frustrating

I'd recommend watching it because it's a genuinely fun movie with no sequel baiting, fun characters, great action and a coherent, albeit simple story. ",6erigc

That final [battle with Ares was shlocky as all hell and kind of deflated everything. If they had made it end on Ares becoming a spirit with humanity, or that general being Ares, it would've been an amazing movie.](#spoiler). 

Despite that part, I really liked it. The fights were mostly really good. I could tell this was a Patty Jenkins movie, and not a DCEU movie, which is much appreciated.

The movie doesn't live up to all the praise and hype it got. Given the rotten tomatoes rating was 92%, I was expecting it to be a masterpiece. Or at least watchable. But it's not. 

Gal Gadot sucks at acting. It seems like they hired her only because she's hot enough to be wonder woman.

If the rest of the DC universe can pick up on the TONE of this movie, I'll have renewed hope for the franchise.  Justice League doesn't need to be all dark and brooding (aka-Snydery).

Gal was excellent, and I loved how well she and Chris played off each other.

One semi-major gripe I have about this movie though: I felt like the slo-mo did more harm than good for the action scenes. It probably doesn't help that I'm usually not a fan of slow motion- generally I prefer it to only be used to demonstrate how an ordinary event is playing out to someone with enhanced senses, i.e. Flash dodging the Batarang or the first time Peter's Spider-sense activates- but I think a lot of the fights would have flowed better if every other flip or spin wasn't at half speed.",6erigc

dirusqj,"I was feeling very burned out when it comes to superhero movies lately, but decided to give this a chance after all the ratings came back positive.  Very glad I watched it, it was a breath of fresh air and made me remember what I used to love about superhero movies originally.

The aspect of this movie that made it so good, I think, was the amount of focus and time they put on Diana's evolution as a warrior and a hero during the movie.  It's not all about the action scenes, she actually gets character development.  She has both an internal and external journey that she goes through, and ends up a changed person as a result.  The Diana that left Themyscira is not the same Diana that is left after the end of the war.  She is *changed* by her journey as a person, and this gives the story more *weight*.

That's an aspect that has been missing from Marvel movies, imo, and is part of the reason I got burned out.  Looking back, Iron Man 1 and maybe Thor 1 were the only other superhero movies where the characters themselves changed as a result of what happened in the movies.  Almost all the other movies, the characters stayed the same internally and the story was all driven by external conflict.  It's a formula that's really easy to get bored with, because there's no more investment in the characters as people, no point in rooting for them because *of course* they're going to win the physical fight.

Wonder Woman made me remember what it was like to really get invested in a character's journey.  Who knows if that'll continue on with the future movies, or how good JL will be, but at least this one movie was enjoyable.",6erigc
diu3g1s,"I really liked this movie. I'd give it a 8/10... There were a few things that bother me but this movie made soooo many things right, and I loved that. 

In terms of my problems with the film: 

-I think the action was amazing but they overused the slowmotion... so many scenes didn't make an impact on me because they were shown in that way. Seeing many of the fights in normal speed could have made a greatest impact on the viewer. 

-There are a few... things that bother me of the last fight. Like the fact that she left the freaking sword in the roof for no reason hahaha. That led to a very strange scene, I noticed a weird cut in the middle... like they maybe shot how she got the sword back and then just left it out of the final cut and it looked bad. Also, regarding editing, some of the CGI  in the battles it's not great... but it didn't bother me much. 

The positive:

 -They did right what The First Avenger tried to do with the time setting. I think you get a great sense of the time period, the war and its consequences without forgeting this is a superheroe movie. That was great and it made me wish the next movie was a period piece too, like in the 50', 70' or whatever. But I am sure it will be set in present time.

-The characters I think are amazing and they are the soul of the movie because the olot while intresting was very straightfoward:
Diana is as pure, brave and selfless as she needs to be, her acts of bravery, her empathy and compassion made me feel really emotional in the theatre, and I haven't felt like that in a superheroe movie in a while. That is, to me, what a character like this should trasmit. 
And then Steve, what s wonderful addition to the story. He is so much more than a love interest but he also serves the story  well in that aspect too, he is smart, brave, supporting of her actions and plays a big role on the story. This really got me thinking... what's up with female love intrest in this kind of movies? Why haven't we seen Lois Lane for example take this kind of role instead of damsel in distress 90% of the time? Steve Trevor is an example in how to add a love interest to the story and make it relevant. 
The amazons were as badass as they should be and the mythology and backstory was explained in a really good way it left me wanting more about Diana's origins. Finally I'd add the other supponting characters, Samer and Charlie... very briefly led to the topics of race in that era and PTSD, and make us care for them too!

-The cinematography and direction: INCREDIBLE. I am so glad we finally got to see some colors in the DCEU hahaha. Themyscira looked beautiful. Also some choices in the story I think were really well made, for example the fact that we dont see her with the full suit until the battle, they saved the use of the sword until the end (I was a bit dissapointed it led to nothing though) and they left a door open for future movies to fully explain Diana's origin and things for the fans to speculate.


I do think this movie could be ""revolutionary"" in terms of female roles in action movies and women behind the camera in this genre, which many people don't care about, but as a fan of cinema I think it is important. This are milestones that have been reached with a lot of effort in the way to equality, even putting carrers and status at risk, so in that terms and extremely happy for this movie $ success and the critical praise for the people involved.

dicmxiv,"The thing I really liked about this movie was that it was a film about war. The Great War wasn't just a background setting, the concept of war and why it exists was an actual theme explored from multiple perspectives. I think it gave the film something really solid to build upon.

I felt like the villains were used as concepts; representations of war and the darkest side of humanity. It's a strength of the movie thematically, but I also think it might be why they don't hold up quite as well when you look at them as characters. I think they have their moments where you get a sense of who they are, but I think they're strongest when you look at them as an idea. That being said, it should be noted that Steve Trevor also represents a side of humanity in the film, while also being a strong character. Chris Pine really did a great job in the roll.

As for Gal Gadot, generally speaking, I found her incredibly charming as Diana. There were a few emotional moments where, I could see it on her face, but it felt a bit flat, but during regular dialogue, she played the naiveté of the character well. There's growth as a character by the end, but I wish that the big emotional moments that cause the shift would have landed a bit stronger with me.

Overall, I liked it, and have already recommended it to others.",6erigc
dicng2b,"Yes! It feels good to come out of a DCEU movie and to be geniunely satisfied. For the first 1h30-45 I was enjoying pretty much every aspect of the movie, the score was a lot of fun, Themyscira looked simply stunning, it was fun to have different kind of color palettes throughout the film and the World War setting was well used. Like most people, I think WW stumbles a little bit toward the end because of the obvious shoe-in villain fight that was just not on-par with the rest of the film. Otherwise I had a blast, the movie is very funny and entertaning, Gal Gadot is perfect as Wonder Woman, she's not the greatest actress but she got the looks and she shines in the action scenes. The chemistry between her and Chris Pine was amazing, my favorite scene is actually a small moment between him and WW, the first time they are on the boat on their way to London, I thought it was a very sweet little moment. My excitement level for Justice League has gone up mostly because I'm looking forward to see WW in the movie. I highly recommend everyone to support this, I give it a 8/10.",6erigc

The fight scenes were good and I thought the set design was incredible.

Doctor Maru had a really good look as well. She should have been the main villain, in my opinion.

While there was a lot to like and it was the best of the current DC movies, I don't think it holds a candle to The Dark Knight or the better Marvel films.

If it had been shorter and had a little more character development it could have been great. It was good, but the pacing felt like it could have been made around the time of Richard Donner's Superman.

I expect this to get downvoted to hell, but I also thought it was weird to have the first female superhero movie contain a makeover scene, her being taught the concept of love as the key to winning, and fighting in high-heeled boots.

I think Wonder Woman was a step forward for female superhero movies and being helmed by a female director, but I think it's going to have a hard time living up to this level of pre-release hype.",6erigc

Gadot just nails Diana on every level and Chris Pine was a solid opposite to her character.

Too timid and protective. Chris Pine's character was good, but also a bit of a jackass, though I think that was on purpose. A few times the audience laughed, but I didn't, because I already heard the jokes in the trailers. Maybe i watch the trailers more than the average person, I don't know. Agree that the villains were a bit weak, but I didn't care that much. I was actually more disappointed by the supporting characters. I just didn't think they were that interesting, and in some cases, just lame or annoying.

They key though and this is what Patty Jenkins got right that Snyder and Ayer didn't was the 'the tone' and establishing the stakes of the movies with well drawn and thought out characters.   
   
Chris Pine's Steve Trevor was the anchor of the film and reflective of what I just mentioned. I also appreciated he was not some Errol Flynn swashbuckling to save the world. He was a normal guy trying to do the right thing and his death had a lot of weight including that touch with him on the plane contemplating his death with that hesitation 
  
Two minor gripes on a movie that deserves it's near universal praise: Agree main villain being a bit weak and I really wanted a payoff for the Charlie character as the haunted marksman.",6erigc
digxksh,"The movie certainly had some great moments throughout, but I feel that other than the characters, the scenes up until Diana and Steve reach land after sailing from Themyscira were the best parts. The island looked stunning, Hippolyta telling Diana their history, the Amazons defending their home, and Diana and Steve bonding with each other on the boat all went really well.  

The slow motion of the fights slightly took me out, especially when at one point there was a slow motion shot every 5 seconds. Although I don't remember if there was much slow motion after that so this may be just a minor nitpick.  

The final fight looked to be yet another CGI fest like the past DCEU films, with the characters hurling objects at each other, tossing each other 50 feet, and a battlefield covered with fire, tons of debris, or just an atmosphere that makes it hard to see. I feel like this could be understandable since the ones who are fighting are essentially gods, and they're not going to hold back anything when they possess so much power. Just...something on a smaller scale would be a nice change.   

Overall I really enjoyed it and am glad it's getting a phenomenal amount of praise. ",6erigc

* Gal Gadot and Chris Pine

* Showed the effects of war effectively (most of the time) through the supporting characters without being too preachy

Disliked:

* Most of the action scenes being choppy, too much slo-mo, too much CGI or illogical

* Mr. Moustache Ares, Ludendorff, Dr. Poison, the roid gas

* Questionable logic and weak plot points starting with and following the No Man's Land scene

diiq6g1,"If I had to boil my issues with the movie, which I overall liked, down to one thing I'd say it's that they didn't have the balls to go with a ""there was no ares, humans just kind of suck"" plot and ending and instead tried to do both. Imagine if instead of going all super saiyan and fighting a mustache, we got roughly the same events after Diana rage-quit humanity when she murdered the nazi and the sacrifice of Steve convinced her that maybe people aren't all bad.

Then they could even have room for an ending stinger where oh no, in a shady board room somewhere that dead nazi guy is still alive and history goes on as it should (because that's ares this time.)

1. wth happened to the German destroyer or frigate or gunboat that was assaulting the beach. All it showed was the rowboats men fighting, but you see the boat providing suppressing fire with mortars or cannons. They should have shown it steaming away at the end or something I might have missed it.

2. More WW1 fight scenes though maybe would have distracted the pacing. I loved how she inspired them to push forward, but would have loved to see more of that.

I also feel like they really screwed the pooch by wiping out the greek pantheon before WWs story really begins and killing off the main villain at the end. That kinda limits the cool greek mythology they could explore in future films. We didn't really get a definitive answer on the current status of Zeus so I guess they could explore that.

*Why would Wonder Woman hand over the God Killer sword to Trevor's secretary?*

Sure she was reluctant to do so but this is a weapon that she believes is the only way to defeat Ares I can't see her entrusting it to some person she's known for a couple of hours.  I doubt she'd even let Steve Trevor hang on to the thing let alone his secretary.

djd61jl,"Alright, so Chief was definitely Ares, and David Thewlis was Zeus. 

This is gonna get buried cuz I'm so late in the game, but hear me out. 

Chief said he armed both sides because he hates white people, he made that car appear out of nowhere, after which spooky music played. He made the entire movie go on and furthered the plot the whole time since he was introduced. He also had the least background of any character in the film, and his name is Chief, like some kind of general, like Ares kinda is. 

Thewlis never ever says he is Ares, he says he is the god of truth, who is Zeus. He throws a bunch of lightning bolts, like Zeus, and talks about how he had his mind changed about humans, while Ares always wanted to just make them fight eachother. Plus, World War II happens. 

I think that Zeus either got dumb over time, or did what he did in order to make Wonder Woman get her powers out so that she can eventually kill Ares. 

Also I don't think Steve died, she probably saved him as her powers turned on right at that moment. He will probably be some antagonist or additional convulsed thing in a later film.",6erigc

did0phd,"There's a lot of hate on Ares... but I don't necessarily agree with all of it.

Ares is established as a corrupting influence on man, but WW and the audience are led to believe that it is a very direct influence.

He very clearly does have a direct influence of some sort - after he dies, the fighting immediately around the weapons depot stops, we see light returning, smiles on the faces of German soldiers as well as WW's teammates, Chief hugs a German soldier. This all pretty clearly shows that yes, Ares can directly affect/influence humanity.

What I thought was interesting is that he spends most of the movie *not* doing that. When we first meet the person Ares is currently posing as, he is a man arguing passionately (and ineffectually) for peace. At the same time, he is influencing Ludendorff and Maru more directly, but limiting his influence here to whispers and ideas for things - playing into the desires of these characters.

If anything, we see an Ares who has changed, developed, and evolved over the centuries. In the stories Diana was told as a child, Ares was the God of War - a being of direct action. He rebelled against the Pantheon and influenced men to war. Since that time, he has changed greatly to become a God of indirect influence, with nuanced plans and implementation of said plans.

Of course, he then reverts back to Direct Action Greek God in the third act - but of course he did! He might have evolved and changed over the many centuries to better adapt to humanity, but Diana was not a product of modern humanity - she was a product of the ancient Greek Pantheon, the Godkiller, Zeus' last stand against the betrayal of his own son. When you are faced with a literal weapon of the Gods, you don't stand on guile and diplomacy and light-touch influence, you armor up and start a fight.

This is exactly what happens - when Ares first revealed himself to Diana, it was as his current guise as the politician. His first attempts to defeat Diana were with words, promises, offers - the tools he had come to rely on. It was only after these failed, and Diana rejected him, that he once again became Ares, God of War in the same manner of his initial rebellion against the Pantheon.

TL;DR: Ares wasn't underdeveloped, but a lot of his development and motivations aren't explicitly stated in the film and you have to read between the lines.",6erigc
die7rqv,"I don't think there should have been modern day opening and closing scenes at all. They should have kept the focus on the past and ended with her returning to her home for some closure with her mother. Final battle should have been better too. A typical complaint I seem to have with most comic book movies, the last fight scene always underwhelms. At least Ares did wear his armor. I was worried he'd just be in a suit the whole fight. 

Overall I liked it, but I can't help but wonder if it only seems so good because of how bad the past few DC movies have been. It's rather average in the grand scheme of things, but that's enough to wow us when it comes to DC because we've been let down that much. I'd put it on par with most good origin movies for sure, with Iron Man/Batman Begins still leading the pack. I think the fact that it was Wonder Woman, the first big female superhero movie, helped it a lot. I overlooked a lot of things I'd have been more critical of it was a standard male driven superhero flick. Such as less than stellar CGI and slow motion being overdone for one thing.

Also Doctor Poison made a gas that makes you able to fight a God albeit briefly, in WW1. Will this be addressed in future DC movies or ignored?

dit2ynz,"I haven't seen anyone post about this, but one of the more ridiculous parts in this movie for me is when [just after Ares reveals himself, and WW is about to fight him, but then realizes she doesn't have her sword. The movie even cuts to showing her sword still on the roof of the watch tower. Then they cut away (to Steve I believe) to a completely different scene, and then cuts back as WW just comes back down with her sword. Ares is still standing there, as if he just let her climb up and grab her weapon (which she didn't even use to defeat him).](#spoiler)",6erigc
djrbc1e,"After hearing so many people talk about the movie... I caved, got some Taco Bell, and put it on. 

It was... slightly above average I want to say? The bar for a superhero movie from DC was already pretty low for me after seeing Suicide Squad but WW definitely surpassed that dumpster fire. It just doesn't stack up to the Dark Knight though. 

It got some things right and some things wrong. But the movie wasn't anything to write home about TBH. I don't understand the hype.

[I had a love/hate relationship with Ares. Having him be a completely normal person with the power of persuasion is an excellent fit for the God of War as his goal is to incite war but never participate in it... but I still couldn't get past how he looked. I feel like the movie could've been better if the German General and Ares switched bodies. A frail old man as a general makes more sense than having some big brawny older guy.](#spoiler)

(The trailer implied romance so I won't omit this part as a spoiler) Other than that, nothing in particular stood out. I mostly didn't want any romance to happen (doesn't fit her character IMO) but it somewhat happened naturally so I didn't mind. I'll also say that the movie dragged on for a little too long IMO.

dihawoe,"I loved the movie and I loved Gadot's Wonder Woman BUT... 

I am obsessed with Dr. Maru. I was not familiar with the character before the movie, but after getting back I looked up her comic book back story. She has been both Japanese and Russian in various iterations, but she initially was a woman in disguise as a man to gain respect as a scientist. I wonder if the writers realized that by taking a woman in disguise during WWII and making her a woman in WWI they created an absolute badass and my spirit animal- minus the regrettable psychopathy. 

Dr. Maru is a successful research scientist during WWI who manages to NOT ONE SINGLE TIME IN THE MOVIE HAVE HER GENDER QUESTIONED. Did anyone else notice that while Diana is wandering around London being kicked out of boys' clubs left and right in her skirts and heels, Dr. Maru is literally turning the tide of war by her unquestionably superior knowledge of chemistry and warfare. She has somehow managed to make heartless German generals like Ludendorff respect her as an equal, not as a woman. Even the other German generals question the gas plan because they dispute it's value over peace NOT because they think a product made my a woman is doomed to failure. How badass is that? How can I become Dr. Maru when I grow up? As an Army officer, too often I find myself wondering if my suggestions would have been given more weight if a man were giving them. Too often I wonder if my ability to make wartime decisions is being questioned because I'm not as strong as a man. But Dr. Maru is over there, never once lifting a finger to prove her mettle in a man's world, she's just sitting there confident in the knowledge that she is better at chemical warfare than every other person in the room and she knows it. It's beautiful, it's magical, and it's downright fantastic.

I sincerely hope that we see more of Dr. Maru. But if we don't, I'm developing a devoted fan fiction anyway because I have to know how Dr. Maru got to where she is, successful and confident and strong. She doesn't fall victim to Chris Pine's flattery because she doesn't need flattery. She is confident in herself, in her product, in her science. Dr. Maru is a strong, independent woman who doesn't need Chris Pine's approval because she doesn't have anyone's disapproval. She's the best. How did she build that confidence? Inquiring and admiring minds want to know! Even as she stated into the face of an angry goddess holding a car over her head, she she didn't beg for her life. Sure, she was scared. But she was wouldn't beg. She knew when she'd met her match. She knew when to bow to another strong woman. 

Furthermore, as much as I would have appreciated the plot twist that ""Ares God of War is a woman"" might have been, I'm really glad Dr. Maru wasn't Ares. Because Dr. Maru is already Wonder Woman's perfect antithesis. Both are warriors, but while Wonder Woman is emotional, impetuous, strong, powerful, uncomfortable in war, and a god, Dr. Maru is brilliant, cunning, cold, calculating and comfortable as hell with war, and *human*. Together they represent the spectrum of women, of how strong we can be but yet how different. Strong women aren't just storybook heros, strong women can be smart, cunning, and ruthless too. Women don't need to be gods to be successful. Sometimes being human works for us too.",6erigc

dikw2q7,"It was a fun movie, and the best DC film since Nolan's Batman. I thought it looked pretty cool, but there were two of three instances where the CGI looked really bad, or just stylistically weird. 

It seems like DC has really doubled down on the Zack Snyder ""look"", and I think that will eventually end up being a mistake.

disjzex,"POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!

My biggest gripe with what was, on the whole, an enjoyable film was the persistent amount of inaccuracies and tripes. It's meant to be set in WWI, and yet there were a multitude of planes (which were barely used at all in WWI), an ice cream stand in a train station (what?), Chris Pine is inexplicably American and working for the British government, there's a native American Indian guy too (?), once again we have the standard cookie-cutter Scottish comic relief character (literally could have transplanted Simon Pegg's 'Scottie' from Star Trek and you wouldn't have noticed a difference), the apparent need for a guy who's main skill was translation when Diana could basically speak every language ever, and mustard gas was the big bad they were trying to prevent in the week leading up to the Armistice agreement despite it being utilized well before in real life (i.e. 1917). I think there were a few more but you get the point. 

I also felt that the whole narrative went to shit after the Ares reveal and the implication that he *did* have an influence on men, because we, as viewers, know that WWII was just around the corner 20 years later when Ares is supposed to have been destroyed (which is arguably a worse war in terms of it being about ideological differences - WWI was about nation states protecting their interests, WWI was about the rise of extreme far right fascism which sought to eradicate a race of people). Given that there has never been an outright war like that one since (forgoing the minefield that is the war on terror/proxy wars etc) it would have been a far more logical place in terms of the narrative for Ares to have been destroyed (although that's perhaps a criticism of the source material rather than the film). 

That moment where Chris Pine is like 'some people are just good and others are bad' felt like the good, hard truth that Diana was going to have to come to terms with and grow from, and then all of a sudden it was like 'lol no actually there's a big super powered bad guy that's been orchestrating the whole thing, humans are all inherently good!' felt a bit cheap, and was followed by a ton of CGI that again reminded me that I'm watching a Holywood blockbuster and not something more deep and gripping. 

Gal Gadot is great casting and I thought, as others have rightly pointed out, that it was clearly 'inspired' by the Captain America films but I'm alright with that. All superhero films are fairly derivative these days, so that doesn't bother me so much. 

Solid 7/10 me thinks. ",6erigc
ditlklp,"Easily one of the best movies I've watched this year, maybe cause I didn't have much expectations from DC, but they knocked the park out of this one.


Really hate how many slow still shots they had tho, some of those punch and kicks did not have to go matrix slo-mo, kept putting me out of the immersion.

Great acting and great story tho, keep it up DC!!!",6erigc
dicnj02,"I thought it was just okay.

This is just my opinion but, I got tired of the slow motion pretty fast, I felt it was way overused. The action looked clunky at beginning. The part where Diana's mother explains stuff is so drawn out and boring. The pacing of the movie felt off. Wonder Woman has the charm but she didn't really feel like she had a ""warrior"" attitude. More like a child who just happens to kick alot of ass (but I guess that's the point). Quite cliché. The message and setting was really interesting though!",6erigc
didu1a6,"It was good, but I don't think it was as great as people seem to be hyping it up, some saying it was up there with Logan as far as superhero movies go. It was quite generic, and the final battle seemed laughably bad, which these superhero movies and even TV shows seem to struggle with regardless. But the World War 1 stuff was great, and I'll always support more WW1 stuff. Character development waxed and waned but was overly quite good. I'd give it a solid 7 out of 10.

I like that they're getting better, the consumer usually wins when there's competition.

I gotta say that I was quite surprised that there was no after-credits scene tying in Justice League, actually kind of refreshing they didn't buy into that trope, shows they're willing to break the mould, take chances.",6erigc
difr4wf,"The thing that is most impressive to me about this movie is the physicality of Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman.

This is THE most physically impressive performance I've ever seen from a woman in film. I believed in her strength in every scene (mystically driven or not) and that really sold me.

Also Gadot is just magnetic throughout. I couldn't take my eyes off her face in the fight scenes and in the character scenes. Her smile is ridiculously contagious too.

I think I'm in love ha.",6erigc
difx9kx,"Probably gonna get shit for this but I had a few problems with the film, the main one being how WW stated she believed the Germans were innocent and that Ares was controlling them, yet proceeded to slaughter the living shit out of any german with a gun, no mercy.  I know it's a movie but it just really took me out of it because they were just regular people forced to be fighting on the front.

Also the whole fight for love thing thrown in at the end (and her random force field bracelets that seemed to grow as she aged and weren't ever explained) kinda took the enjoyment out too ",6erigc
diguzvw,The first 80% of that movie deserved so much better than the last 20%,6erigc
dihgruw,"I am very surprised at the amount of high praise this film is getting. I thought it was very average, I don't regret going to see it but damn, I was not nearly as blown away as some of you. 

One of the things that is genuinely perplexing me is some commenters who seem to be praising the film for its feminist slant. I thought that feminists would be one of the more critical groups. Here's why. 

So Diana is a strong, willful woman who constantly resists what her mother says to do as she wants to learn how to fight. She wants nothing more than to know how to fight. 

When Steve arrives it starts to go downhill, from the moment that he leads her into hiding from the Germans arriving. She just rescued him, surely it should have been her leading him? 

Then sexual tension begins to build between them over the course of the movie. This is fine, I think it would have been better if she didn't fall in love with quite literally the first man she meets but whatever. How does this sexual tension resolve itself though? Steve decides to stay and fuck her and she seems to just sort of roll with it. Steve decides. This wilful, strong, powerful woman who has no reason to think that she needs to wait for him to make a move does exactly that. Hell I would have preferred it if they made love on the boat, when she invites him to sleep with her rather than somewhere less comfortable. 

Then the other part of their romance that really bothered me is that millions of lives were at risk, possibly the end of the world if Ares continued to get his way and... that wasn't enough to motivate her! She only really cared once this one dude that she fucked died. Am I really the only one who thought that seemed crazy backwards?

This wasn't enough to ruin the movie for me but damn did it feel weird considering the way they could have done it. Other things that bothered me were the editing and the inconsistent narrative. Diana starts out somewhat naive and sees the world in black and white. The Germans aren't all evil, both sides are bad. But they only really seemed to tell us this, not show it. They never showed the allies using gas or the effects of the British blockade of German ports had on Germany. One of the biggest things that contributed to us winning the war was that blockade, it helped starve the Germans out. Have a look at [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnip_Winter), there was not even enough food to keep just the soldiers fed. I think it would have been poignant to show this. Instead we are just told that both sides have good and evil. A German member of their little group might have also helped show this. It also felt very off message when the action scenes showed them killing Germans with a strange sort of glee in my opinion

This conflicting narrative even affects the final battle when Ares reveals that he isn't the cause of war. We know this is true because war continues even after Ares is killed. So why do the Germans start hugging their enemies? This scene felt very cheesy and like the studio wanted to have the message but also have an uplifting ending.

One more, little potential nitpick. Did anyone get a good look at the tank that Wonder Woman was holding over Doctor Poison that she was threatening to crush her with? I zoned out a little and when I payed attention again, they never showed the whole tank but I could have sworn from the tracks and the sponsons that it was a British [tank](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Mark_IV.jpg). As they were on a German base, their tank would have looked like [this](http://tank-photographs.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ww1-german-Strumpanzerwagen-a7v-tank-replica-bovington.jpg). I could be wrong as I didn't get a good look but as you can see the two are very distinctive and it seems weird that I would think it was a British MkIV. I suppose it could have been a captured one but I don't see why they would not just make the tank the A7V to avoid confusion.",6erigc
diddcwj,"I saw this movie last night, and I have to say I was extremely whelmed by this movie... not over or under. I thought they used slow-mo way too much for scenes that didn't need it, and I didn't like some of the actor choices/actors in general (did anyone else think the guy who played Chief was a pretty bad actor?). I did enjoy the story, though, and I'm still happy to have seen the movie because it's one step closer to Justice League. 

Honestly, I did have two kids sitting behind me talking the entire fucking time, and that might've affected my opinion a bit, but yeah... didn't think it was anything amazing.",6erigc
dih2fdj,"Did anyone else feel like the message got lost a bit?

Ares makes his whole point about how humanity is evil and he doesn't have to influence them at all, but after he dies the Germans immediately look friendlier and stop fighting the heroes and then the next cut is to the victory parade in London.

Like, if Ares wasn't influencing people then why did the war end as soon as he died?  What's the deal with WWII and other future wars?

Also, what happened to the evil chemistry lady.  I get that Diana sympathized with humanity but come on I think she gets a pass if she crushed a war criminal with a tank",6erigc
diokjz8,"I liked it but people are hyperventilating on how Amazing it is.. it really isn't.  I guess we just have low expectations from a DC movie but come on, try to have some consistent standards.

The plot was just the characters traveling from point A to point B.  The villains were cliche and defeated themselves.  

The action gets a lot of praise, but it was kinda mediocre.  They randomly do slow-mo so you can see the obviously CG wonder woman-amazonesses doing pointless backflips. 

I feel critics are under social pressure to declare this the best movie ever, and will ignore the glaring flaws.  Overall I'd say this is the 3rd best super hero movie this year.  Logan delivered WAY more emotion and heart and Guardians absolutely blew Wonder Woman away in terms of spectacle",6erigc
diq3x4h,"What I loved was that Steve Trevor wasn't a fucking sexist, despite the time. he doesn’t sexualize her for how she dresses or expect her to be quiet cause she’s a woman. he tries to cover her up only in london because he understands the culture, she doesn’t. but outside of that he’s not like “shouldnt u wear more lol?”

he tries to be SO respectful by not sleeping next to her???

HE NEVER DEMEANS HER FOR BEING A WOMAN EVEN THOUGH THE SOCIETY HE IS FROM EXPECTS HER TO.",6erigc
djn61ge,"God, this was underwhelming... 
After the overall good ratings this movie received I was really confident to see the first great outing of the DCEU. What I witnessed instead was a film filled with clunky dialogue, an uninteresting story, strange pacing and way to much dodgy CGI that was sprinkled with a handful of visually interesting action scenes. At least the chemistry between Chris Pine and Gal Gadot works pretty well despite the messy writing.

I somehow get the same feeling as last year with the good ratings for the Ghostbusters reboot (which is of course way worse than ""Wonder Woman""). Just because we all want to see a good female-superhero movie is this desire no justification for praising an okay film as a great one.

",6erigc
dicqbrx,"The climax really blindsided me in how emotional it ended up being. It wasn't just a physical fight to the death, but an honest ideological battle for the future of humanity. (Kind of a random comp, but) It reminded me of the climax to Paranorman. The movie spends it's time setting up these thematic puzzle pieces, and tosses them all into a blender alongside some dazzling action. Then it spits out an emotional climax that really surprised me. This is greatly aided by the *amazing* performances from Gadot and Thewlis. Thewlis really sold his vision, and Gadot was *really* tempted. idk if I'm making making sense. Jenkins turned a conventional good guy v bad guy final battle into something so much more. It's among the best CBM climaxes I think I've ever seen.

This movie rocks. It has a few issues, but frankly I don't even care about them. They are completely overshadowed by the big moments and big emotions this movie gifts to you.

The No Man's Land section was easily one of the best things I've seen in a superhero movie, actually in any movie. The music was brilliant too. 

I did have one criticism but it's no longer a criticism now that I reflect on it. I thought some scenes were a tad too long but the scenes really helped the character development and story so I quite enjoyed them.

After the extreme disappointments of Batman vs Superman and Suicide Squad last year I couldn't convince him to come watch Wonder Woman with us. Even after the favorable reviews he just didn't want to be let down again.   
I'm pretty sure I'll be able to convince him to go watch it with me for my second viewing!   


**The Good**  

* Gal Gadot as Diana! She was already one of the few bright spots of BvS and she knocked it out of the park here. Shes powerful, smart, energetic and endearing all in one. She has a perfect blend of curiosity and determination and I cannot wait to see more of her.  
* Chris Pine is a close second for favorite character. Gadot and him have great chemistry.    
* There is a good mix of action, comedy and some really sincere and dramatic moments.  
* Although cheesy at times, I personally love that they went all out on how awesome Diana is as a fighter. She's a goddess fighting humans and it really shows in the over-the-top action sequences.   
* The origin story was really well done to set up the story whilst not dragging on excessively.  
* It felt like the movie was constant ramp up, which I really loved. It never really dragged and the action got better and better.  
* There were some truly beautiful shots, my favorite being Diana walking in the orange poison cloud.  
* I **really** loved the slow-mo action style they chose for the movie. I think it helped keep the action understandable whilst still showing just how powerful Diana is. Without the slow-mo it would have either been too fast to follow Diana at her speed or she wouldn't have seemed as overpowering.  
* Steve Trevor had a great arc as a character and I'm impressed they decided to have him sacrifice himself in such a powerful way.  
* The score was terrific. Having heard and loved the WW theme already in BvS I was excitedly anticipating it's arrival. I also loved that it was partially mixed into a couple of the other tracks.  
* I loved that her fight with Ares turned almost dreamlike at the end and was quite reminiscent of the story animation her mother told her at the beginning. 

**The Bad**   

* I felt the other three characters in their team were really underdeveloped. I liked most of what we saw of them but they were sidelined too much.  
* Once again the villains were forgettable. Having three villains seemed like way too much.  
* Why was Ares such an old guy? His minister persona from the first part of the movie wasn't really vital to the movie so he could have just been any other character they met along the way. Him being an older British gentleman with a mustache whilst also being a God of war just made people in my cinema laugh out loud.  
* My friend had a prefect description of Ares armor, ""he's like a guy who's played Skyrim for a bit too long"".  
* ~~Was Steve Trevor suppose to be British or American? He worked as a spy for the British but he obviously had an American accent. Was Chris Pine just not trying or was he originally American? Chief said something about ""his people destroying his homeland"" but that could have referred to Americans or just white people in general.~~ Apparently I didn't listen closely enough   
* Some of the CGI was a bit spotty. Examples I remember are right after Steve stole the notebook and is flying away, a couple of times when Diana is jumping really high and quite a few of the explosions.  
* I think the trailers showed way too much of the best action set pieces. I'm glad they didn't show the final battle but I honestly thought Diana fighting regular soldiers was even better. The trailers showed huge chunks of the beach battle, crossing the no mans land, liberating the small town and her battle with Ludendorff. I think I would have enjoyed those moments even more if I hadn't seen so much already.   
* After she killed Ludendorff Steve had a really good speech how it's not just about one bad guy controlling everything, it's about the choices every human makes. Killing one guy isn't going to stop the war and make it all ok. I thought this was a really good jab at the superhero trope where killing the one bad guy stops everyone else. Then they go and ruin it when she kills Ares and the German soldiers are all happy and seem to have been just under his control. One soldier even hugs Chief!  


Overall a really enjoyable movie that I cannot wait to watch again. I really hope this sets the bar for future DC movies but I'm still weary of Justice League. If only Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg could get movies this good first before we see them all together. ",6erigc

diesyma,"*Wonder Woman* is a film that is rooted in rich mythology and history but avoids the tropes and trappings of ""throwback"" films that rely solely upon nostalgia, and it's a film that demonstrates how femininity is not the antithesis of physical (and emotional) strength but never resorts to cheap gimmicks to empower its female characters.

It's a film that isn't afraid to jump between Diana in adorable fish-out-of-water situations and Diana kicking a ton of ass on the battlefield, and it does so without inducing too much mood whiplash. It's a tricky balancing act that we've seen be done badly in many a superhero origin movie but Patty Jenkins pulls it off masterfully here.

Chris Pine is perfect in a supporting role that never overshadows Gal Gadot's but never seems like one that was written to be purposefully inferior to hers either; they just complement each other so well, and I challenge anyone to watch this movie and not ship the fuck out of these two afterwards.

I think it's a fucking incredible movie and it's the first time in a long time that I left the cinema wanting to watch the entire movie (not just a handful of fun scenes) again, and go on that emotional journey with the characters again. That's more than I can say for the average summer blockbuster, and if nothing else *Wonder Woman* is above average.",6erigc

Gal Gadot did an awesome job for sure, but outside the Island, the backing characters had little to no backstory, and I found them to be very forgettable, to no fault of the actors themselves, rather the writing.

If these DC movies hold one thing, it's awesome makeup/costuming design. All in all, I'd probably put it in the 4/10 range. Again, great and convincing acting, weak plot and backstory for everyone but WW. ",6erigc
diehyud,"- Gal Gadot _is_ WW. Happy for her after all that bizarre hate at her announcement - the criticism against her appearance often by people who just seemed envious of her, was really put to rest spectacularly.

- Patty Jenkins looked to use this as a vehicle to inspire the female audience; both grown up, but also the young girls in the audience - in that vein, the OTT action scenes and the leap into the sunset which would have otherwise been cheesy, are perfect - even as a man, i walked away thinking how inspired i would be if i was a young girl after watching the credits roll - i'd likely have a new fictional role model

- Something about how Jenkins captured emotion even scenes with little to no dialog was highly impressive. 

- As someone often irritated at Tumblr feminism, Jenkins wasn't patronising in her use of feminism - she cleverly made everyone balanced in their strengths & weaknesses

- One big thing about the tone of the movie was Diana's naivete - as she gets older, it's likely she will get more jaded, that's just something we will have to accept

- probably being a CB fan, i guessed who Ares was nearly immediately - but what bugged me was the mustache; all that budget and they could have made him a dark emptiness with red glowing eyes and he would have been truly ominous in appearance 

- speaking of darkness, the setup for Darkseid is coming along nicely 

- the accents are so sexy. lol.

- The way WW was captured made you admire her beauty rather than lust - the goddess in every sense was pinned down to perfection

- Jenkins's was wonderful in her execution of actions scenes; i guess im in a minority but while i love the overall smoothness of Marvel's action sequences - DC's beatdowns always feel more godlike

- The chemistry & evolution of the characters really made you care for them. big win here.

- Chris Pine. that last fucking scene. acted the shit out of it just with his eyes.

- That leap into the church - oh Lord, it truly makes you take notice WW's the real fucking deal

my friends , both girls went in with zero knowledge of her, and went out major fans - DC, please analyse why people love this film - there's hope for the franchise just yet

diobfql,"Saw it last night.  Decent movie, but really surprised at all the love its getting.  

The 2 hr 30 minutes went by fairly quick, but there were quite a few times where I felt the movie dragged.  I read that the director didn't cut any scenes, and I think that was a mistake.  This movie definitely could have used some trimming.  

But also, the movie should have developed the characters more.  Themascura was just there and left, I would have liked to see more of Wonder Woman's development, both as a warrior and philosophically.  I would have also liked to see the bad guys and supporting cast developed a lot more.  They were just kinda there.  The only characters given real development were Steve Treveor and Wonder Woman, and even then, it could have been better.

The plot wasn't bad, in the sense that it was a lot more coherent and focused than other movies, but it wasn't really that special.  With Wonder Woman wanting to stop the war, it was odd because she was doing most of the fighting on Steve's side.  I would have liked her to have been more neutral and help both sides.  

The action was Ok, but after how much I loved Wonder Woman's brief appearance in Batterman v Superman, I expected it to be a whole lot better.  I like Gadot as Wonder Woman, and she was believable as a warrior (again, I LOOOOOOVED when she came out in the Doomsday fight), but her fighting scenes consisted mostly of her bouncing around and slow mo shots.  Could have been better.  The No Man's Land scene gets lots of praise, and it was decent, I guess, but given how much Steve Trevor hyped up the impossibility of the battle, it was underwhelming that the opposing force seemed to be just about 10 guys.

The baddies were just kinda there and underdeveloped, and the Ares ""twist"" was ok, but given that he's freaking Ares, I expected more than just a Dragonball fight.  Plus, seeing the actor as Ares, was kinda silly, since he looks really weak and scrawny.  

It's definitely not a bad movie, and I'll pick it up when it comes out, but it doesn't have that ""wow"" factor that puts me in a hurry to watch it again.  

With that said, I really like Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, and eventhough I disagree, I'm happy with the praise the movie's getting because it means we'll get a sequel.  This movie reminds me a lot of the problems I had with Captain America's first movie, and it would be amazing if in the sequel, we get something like ""Winter Soldier"" levels of improvement..",6erigc

Best DCEU movie by a longshot, and probably one of my favorite comic book movies in a long time. I watch them as a fan and don't really seem them in a significant light because of their tendencies to be samey, but Patty Jenkins and Allan Heinberg are the G.O.A.T. for pulling this off.

For starters, I love the new DC Studios logo. Gives them a real sense of pride. Not a fan of Robin Wright getting third billing and dying in the first half hour, but that's just the movie.

The script and direction were off the wall for a movie of this genre, and it was really good to see a modern feminist film that doesn't hold back on ""Yay for women"", but also doesn't pull a ""She's a woman so we have to make it a thing"". The soldiers saw she was a woman and let her do her thing, and that was that. Pretty realistic to be fair. 

Gal Gadot and Chris Pine had some real chemistry going on, and even though it didn't shock me that he'd die at the end, it does add some depth to Diana to know that the only human she's ever loved has been gone for 100 years. The little ""Thanks for bringing him back to me"" had genuine emotion behind it. No sad music or lingering shots, just a simple thing that shows a lot of humanity.

And that's probably what made this movie glue together for me. *Man of Steel* and *Batman v Superman* have these cold, objective views of humanity and people that, while sometimes working for these movies, can outright go against the themes/morals of the characters. It's not a bad thing and certainly separates them from the MCU, but it isn't always a bad idea to share some idealism. And if you're *Suicide Squad*, then you can have your dreary view of trashy people artificially sweetened to be made more like a Marvel movie.

The movie had so much heart. From the Scottish sniper who sings to the suave Arab guy to the rogue Steve Trevor, everyone had something that made them a real person. There were a lot of silly jokes that real people would make, like the one about the ice cream or Steve's musings about being average.

The last 10 minutes with Diana and Ares duking it out completely went against the rest of the movie and just seemed like they were doing it because that's what you're supposed to do in a comic book movie. 

Overall, things are looking bright for the DC Universe, and if we get more of this lighthearted optimism in *Justice League*, I'm looking forward to it.

Was anyone else really thrown off though in one of the shots leading up to the climax?

There was a shot of Wonder Woman on a horse but the shot was tilted 90 degrees and felt like a titled horizontal video. Was actually one of the worst shots I've ever seen and really took me out of the film for a bit. Everyone around me was obviously confused as well when I looked around.

dicpmtb,"Great movie absolutely loved it, easily the best of the DCEU.  I only wish that they hadn't brought Ares into it.  If they leave it that Ares didn't start the war and sometimes man is just evil it makes it a much more unique and, in my opinion, better movie.  Too many super hero movies give you a single villain who once defeated it solves all the problems, it would have been nice to have the ""villain"" just be evil in general, and have her realize that there is no solution and that she has to live with that and try to help as many people as possible.

I know that they tried to keep it that way by saying that he just gave them ideas and didn't directly influence them but it felt cheap to me.

I know it probably also has something to do with the comics and again, I really loved the movie I was just slightly disappointed when Ares showed up after the great scene where Steve talked about how men are evil and its not about if they deserve help but about what you believe in.

dicr6il,"""It doesn't matter what they deserve. What matters is what you believe in."" I felt like that was a wonderful summary of the main theme of the film, and extremely important for today's times. I can excuse the lack of development, Ares-wise, in the place of great protagonist development, Diana-wise. I'd say that Zod was, easily, a much better villain than Ares, but Patty Jenkins achieved that empathetic, real character development that I felt Zack Snyder was aiming for in Man of Steel. Great movie. Will definitely be watching it again.",6erigc

As i drove home I kept thinking of things this film did right...then did great...then realized this film was actually pretty damn good. They killed an essential character (something that even took me by surprise), Gadot kills it as WW, the Ares reveal and fight was great, and they had some GREAT shots during the fight scenes (personal favorite was in the one house after no mans land that vaguely reminded me of the Batman warehouse scene in BvS). I absolutely still have my reservations (i.e. Still too many cuts during the fighting) but that's coming from my nit-picky asshole side. Otherwise this film was a lot of fun and a great step in the right direction for D.C. Still worried about justice league but now I have (some) hope ",6erigc
dieckfs,"Overall, very solid movie and one of the better superhero movies I've seen since the Dark Knight trilogy. One part no one seems to have mentioned made me chuckle: Diana mentions that if she defeats Ares she will save the Germans from his war spell and they will never do anything evil again, or something to that effect. It was a bit of bitter irony since the Germans are about to get *way* more evil after World War I. ",6erigc

1) Where did she get a new sword (the one from BvS) after the one she had was destroyed?

I am also pleased- and rubbed it in my cousin's face when he shut it down instantly-  that I guessed who Ares was. When he walked into the pub to encourage the group to go ahead with the mission I had a feeling he was the real Ares.

I really really enjoyed the movie though. The first 30 minutes dragged a little, but I never have cared for characters back when they were kids unless it's a flashback.

7.5/10 better than Suicide Squad and BvS. I still enjoyed MoS though I think.",6erigc
difgs33,Pretty decent. Gadot and Pine were great together. The 3rd act had WAY too much CG and felt out of place with the awesome hand to hand combat that took place in most of the movie. The payoff with Ares wasn't effective for me. A step in the right direction for the DCEU nonetheless. ,6erigc

dii1slw,"My personal assessment (of each battle scenes):

****MAJOR SPOILER BELOW****

The beach - I think it was well done. We got to see the power of the Amazons when its essentially fought with sticks and stones against the war machines of WWI. Thus the slomo for these particular moments were empowering

The alley fight - the bird-eye view stole the scene of the fight. Being able to deflect every bullet at point-blank range is nothing to scoff at and is an excellent display of Diana's fighting prowess in a new environment. After all, that WAS her first actual battle outside of the beach scene where she didn't do much..

The bar fight - as a further confirmation of her confidence, she threw that doode across the bar with a smirk on her face. What more do you need from this?!

The no man's land - my GF got the chill when Diana was fed up with all the naysayers and lack of apparent will to do battle. It was basically this: ""if you won't do this, then I will and I will show you how it's done"" -- cue the dramatic climbing up the ladders to see her full suit for the first time. Taking slow steps at a time, while effortlessly deflecting bullets coming at blinding speed. Those first steps were already real progress far more than the men of WWI who fought for INCHES for years. This is a clear difference in prowess. It was then she saw the inspiration she inspired in the people around her and her team in particular to really step up, fight at her side, and support her with all of their might.

The battle in Veks (sp town name?) - I felt like it was something out of a video game, where you enter a town and need to go into one or two building to clear out the enemies before reaching checkpoint. The final boss being flipping that tank without getting shot and demolishing the church tower. This whole battle scene shown in the trailer and now in full flesh on the screen is what (to me) defined the entire movie. A woman, an Amazon standing alone in a man's world -- recreating the warehouse scene where Batman deftly dealt with mercenaries in the cruelest way possible -- Wonder Woman did so with grace, fluidity, overwhelming the men in mere flashes..(naturally, with less blood and cruelty afford by our own Batman..)

The battle against Ludendorff - lifting him up to the top of the tower with her lasso of truth was a nice touch. Stabbing him with her sword was a touche for me and her slow realization that she was wrong about Ludendorff being Ares which pivotal to her understanding the world.

The battle against Ares - I do believe Ares can take form of any man in disguise - but does he have to maintain the same face as he donned his armors? No! It should become pitch black with red eyes or something, that would help make him much more menacing..the battle was a bit over blown with too much CGI, especially when Steve Trevor blew up in that plane and set off Diana in essentially a berserker mode - I felt it was poorly done. I was hoping for a more Faora-ul vs the military-esque type of battle but with more men, more speed, more brutality to truly reflect her rage rather than orange and red background compounded with the Nazi moving in slow-mo with Diana basically throwing them around... then there's the final fight with Ares. The lead up to the battle was confusing. How was Ares able to elude Diana in the beginning with his ghost schicks and suddenly getting knocked down left and right as the battle progressed?? Make no sense to me.

Finally, I don't think Ares is dead. I think I read somewhere (comics or otherwise) that Ares is powered by war and death. We know in history that there will be more war and death to come. It will be easy for him to resurrect and essentially ""return"" from the dead.

Pishposh, bottom line - most the battle was well done but the final battle with Ares was too overblown and preferred it to be more grounded and akin to BvS battle against Doomsday..

dil7gom,"I'll go ahead and mirror some of the comments already made. 7/10 for me, maybe 6/10. It was enjoyable. I quite liked Gal Gadot in the role, FAR more than I expected to. I also very much enjoyed Chris Pine as Steve Trevor. He was a very believable and fairly well developed character. The action scenes were solid, and the story was fairly coherent and reasonably well told. Now my complaints. It was predictable. I called who Ares was and that Diana was the ""godkiller"" within the first 30 minutes. The villains were horribly underdeveloped. Dr Poison could literally not have been in the movie and it wouldn't have changed a thing. The only thing her super gas did was take out that one town, which could have been just as easily done by the conventional gas weapons they already had, or conventional artillery shelling for that matter. The German generals motives or backstory went completely untouched. We just knew he was evil and wanted the war to continue. I get why, to keep the Ares twist alive, but still, no development. Ares was well played until he had to fight. That's Ares. The literal God of war. He should be more of a challenge than that. Most of the good characters were poorly developed as well. The secretary lady was a treat for the short time she was on screen. But I can't remember her name. Shows how much development she got. Steve's merry band of misfit scoundrels was heading towards being interesting and then their development just.... stopped. I never had a sense of place or situation the second they left Themiscyra. The setting development was flat awful. The music was good enough I never noticed it, except when Wondy's rock anthem jarred in. I like the music, but it does not fit totally with this movie at all. All in all this was a very competent movie that needed more time to stretch it's legs. More development of the interesting side characters. More time to explore the overarching themes, like the war is a human condition and that the Germans were just people too. More time for the villains to be shown actually doing bad things. It's an enjoyable movie that's only knee deep, and what galls is that it could have easily been much better. I do recommend it, and it's easily the best DCEU movie to date (I do not count anything before Man of Steel in that). But it could have been so much more so easily.",6erigc
dil7qiv,"While I enjoyed the movie, I really disliked the climax of the film. I loved all the action scenes besides the final one which just seemed really bland with dark fiery shots where you can't tell as much what's going on. Wonder woman punching, slicing people up and sliding around on her shield during the village scene? cool. Wonder woman using her fiery aura to knock soldiers over and block Aeries' projectile attacks? not so much. Also the villain needs some developing here. I dislike red herring troupes where they bait the villain to only reveal the true villain right under their nose! Boring. The Dark Knight is my favorite superhero film not because of a twist ending bad boss. We know who the Joker is for the entire film and learn about him throughout the film. More superhero films need to do this. It'll be interesting to see where they take Wonder Woman from here since she'll be now rid of that naivete charm of this movie where she is seeing the world of mankind in awe and wonder and more of a character who has seen and lived through a century of mankind. Anyways 8/10 ",6erigc

I felt like it copied a bit from Captain America though - the cyanide scene, you could tell instantly that Chris Pine was gonna kill himself as soon as he got on the plane. 

Great action, brought some emotional heft thanks to the WW1 setting. Humor was well done too, not overused. The no man's land scene was great. 

Fairly predictable though. I knew Claire Underwood was gonna die as soon as she started talking, plus I felt like they just laid the whole movie out there with the Aries prologue. The ""it's what you believe"" line was pretty cheesy too. So did ""I love you"".

didbnym,"A lot to like, and yeah, it's much better than the other recent DC dreck. Still not an outright win for me, though, but it should do well, and deservedly so for being a solid superhero flick with some heart.

Chris Pine kind of steals it from the lead, though. Gal Gadot is sweet and beautiful and has good energy and does a fine job in the role, but it kind of needed Pine to give it both some levity and some weight. That probably sounds sexist in a film celebrating a powerful woman, but I mean that in terms of acting chops and also the way the characters are written.

The whole intro section seemed a bit labored, but then it starts to pick up when Pine arrives and gets quite good for a while there, but never quite reaches amazing.

I love David Thewlis as an actor, but he was just a little bit laughable as the big bad. Something about seeing an old dorky British nerd portraying this kick ass powerful god felt a bit odd.

One minor niggle is that they had set up her theme song riff in the BvS film and in the trailers, and I really liked it, but they only did variations of it in this movie. I did like the music and scoring in general, though.

dj8l159,"**SPOILERS**Reading through the comments i feel like im alone in saying that I hated this film. I went into it without any expectations really, as I dont watch Superhero movies all that often. 

**The Good**
*The Acting*
Chris Pine and Gal Gadot are great in their roles. For me Pine was the best character in the movie and was really well cast in the role of Steve Trevor. Gadot is a very believable Diana, she comes off strong and I never once felt doubt that her character could be as powerful as she is. They handle their lines well and are believable as their characters. Their relationship was also a high point in the film since they played off each other well and you got a genuine feeling that these two characters enjoyed one another, as well as their romance seeming natural instead of forced. Also Sameer and Charlie were pretty good, both actors delivered solid performances and I enjoyed their screen time.

*The Plot*
Overall the plot is okay. And I say this loosely because alot of my issues with this move are also surrounding the plot. For the most part it make sense and there is a clear goal that the protagonists are trying to accomplish

**The Bad**
*The Beginning* 
The beginning of the movie is SOOOO boring and lacks any character. I felt at times I was watching a parody of a superhero movie with the amount of cliche lines that were said in such a short time frame, like ""She doesnt know how powerful she is"" and ""I pray she never knows who she truly is, for her sake"" The majority of the opening focused on teaching the audience about who the amazonians are and how they got on their island. The problem with it is its so superficial. We get a couple lines of dialogue that talk about who the main villain in the movie is and what can be done to defeat him. They threw in so many lines about how Wonder Woman isnt an amazonian (which many times was said to her directly, but she never once asked ""Then what am I"")  to make the viewer question her origins, but they never address them until the very end. I felt like they could have removed all of that dialogue and just kept the ending section explanation and it would have worked a little better. 

*The Moral Ambiguity*
The film attempts to portray World War I as morally ambiguous, as in they want the viewer to say ""maybe the Germans arent necessarily the bad guys, maybe this war was to complex to be seen as only Good vs Evil"" which would be fine if it wasnt so poorly executed. They toss in a scene where the german antagonist and Dr. Poison (what a lame name) walk into the german commanders discussing the terms of the peace treaty and they argue and the German General say something like ""we cannot continue this war, it will cost far to many german lives"" which is in stark contrast to the British general stating that ""dying is what soldiers do"" Its a good setup to give the viewers doubt that the people Wonder Woman is killing are actually bad guy. The problem is that this scene did not matter **at all** this ambiguity is never felt again in the rest of the film and the viewer is lead to believe that everything wonder woman does is **good**.

The film also does a mediocre job at depicting the horrors of war. They have one scene in which it shows wounded men being moved back from the front line that lasts for about 30 seconds that ends with wonder woman saying ""This is horrible"" and that's the best they could do. Charlies character also has PTSD or shell shock which comes into play 2 times in the film but its never expanded upon making it feel unimportant or unnecessary to his character. The scene as well when they gassed the village was also incredibly weak. It was so poorly shot with wonder woman running around in a brown haze with the shapes of corpses on the ground that struggled to even care that the village was bombed. I had no emotional investment in the villagers since they were shown for about half a second and it was hard to feel the horrors of war when all you really see is a brown fog. If this scene was done closer to how Fury had done it, I could see it being a highlight of the movie.

**The Chief**
Why is he even in this film? This character was so unfunny, uncharismatic, and just plain boring that I struggled to not walk out of the theater when he was on screen. I can only imagine the reason he was put in this film was so that the studio could fulfill a diversity requirement. 

Sameer and Charlie felt like real characters who were valuable to the plot and had skills and personalities that reached outside the characters culture. The Chief on the other hand was a **WALKING STEREOTYPE**. I mean come on, first off his name is THE CHIEF, I mean really? the best they could come up with is The Chief? His primary contribution to the team is tracking and making FUCKING SMOKE SIGNALS, i mean come on! It's as if in the writers meeting they said ""We have this native american character in mind, but what should he do?"" ""Well hes native american so he'll track things and make smoke signals, because that's what they do right?""

**The CGI**
It was so bad. For a movie this size and budget the effects looked incredibly dated and laughable. Also, I do not understand why they had to slow motion EVERYTHING. Just when the pacing was getting good in a fight they have to slow down the action just so the audience knows the move shes doing is super cool, because GUYS ARE YOU SEEING THIS? SHES DOING A FLIP AND SHOOTING THREE ARROWS! ISN'T IT SO  AWESOME WE NEED TO SLOW IT DOWN SO YOU CAN SEE HOW AWESOME IT IS. It made the pacing of the fights seem slow and I actually felt it ruined some of the extraordinary moves because they went so slowly. 

**Diana's Naivety** 
I understand that Diana is just being exposed to a new world and lacks understanding of their nature and culture, and a large part of her adventure is her discovering what humanity is and how this new world works, but some of the time her naivety crosses the line into stupidity and it lessens the strength of her character. It feels like she lacks any form of critical thinking, the way she needs to be lead around and the lack of thought in many of her decisions make me feel that she is just a walking tank that needs to be pointed in the right direction, rather than an arbiter of good. 

**Conclusion** 
Wonder Woman was a mediocre superhero film that has reached high acclaim from what i can only ascribe to the overhyping of a female superhero movie. I feel like Diana could be much stronger as a character and that the final product is underwhelming when compared to the large catalog of superhero movies out today. 
 

",6erigc
diejzz2,"What I love about this movie:

* Actual characterization. In BvS, I don't really care about Batman or Superman because they just are. That movie expects the audience to already know and root for the characters. I'm so glad that WW didn't repeat that mistake; granted, WW is not as popular as Batman and or Superman, but it's so nice to see a character that feels real and layered. Diana is strong, intelligent, but also vulnerable and naive. 

* Excellent dialogue all around. I can just feel and understand Steve Trevor's frustration when he tries to explain the grim reality of war and Diana just not getting it. So many golden and meaningful dialogue in this film, and them being in that everyday real-life language makes it all more real and hits home.

*  Wonder Woman herself. Goes without saying, but Gal Gadot is a talent. She really shows the naivete and the fierceness of Diana really well, she's not just some model, she's an actress, and a good one. The fact that she was pregnant during filming is one hell of a feat, as well.

* Steve Trevor. So glad that this isn't a 'women-are-better-than-men' movie. He is charming and genuine. What really sold his character for me is that he just honest-to-God tried his hardest. He tries to explain reality to some non-human that has no previous notion of it, he tries to make Diana understand, he tries to make a difference. Most men in his place would just give up trying to explain things but not Trevor. Shows how he really, truly, respects Diana as a person which not a lot of men do. Gadot and Pine's characters' chemistry is pleasant to watch as well.

What I do not love about this movie:

* Too much slow-mo in the action sequences. One or two here and there is fine, but in WW there's just too much of it that takes away the immersiveness of the experience. We get it, she's awesome and what she's doing is badass, but less slow-mo is appreciated.
* Overuse of CGI in the climax battle. It just doesn't look natural enough (I'm pointing out the scene where Diana runs through a field of fire) and a lot of it is super cheesy as hell. [The mega-beam that finishes the big baddie](#spoiler), the super pose when she's in the air, I almost laughed in a battle that's supposed to be grand and epic.

* Cliche ending. Wish they did something different. [Power of love, seriously.](#spoiler) Am I the only one who feels that that came out of nowhere? It would a lot nicer if Diana went into super saiyan mode after she realizes something about herself, not because of [grief-anger from Steve Trevor's death.](#spoiler) While understandable, it feels cheap. This is not an insult to Diana and Steve's relationship, it's just that throughout the whole movie, the message isn't about love (at least, that's what I get). It's about learning to see the world as is, not black or white and simple. It's about growing up. It's not 'love trumps all'. 

**tl;dr** The up's of this movie is it feels genuine; the characters and dialogue has a lot more nuance and it's a joy to watch. The down's are mostly technical and it's very formulaic towards the end. A solid **7.5/10** for me. Would be an 8.5 if not for the let down third act.

An amazing story, casting, cinematography, etc. The only thing I have an issue with, is early in the movie, when Diana first demonstrates her ""god power,"" why wasn't that questioned more - by Diana herself and everyone who witnessed it?

dih3xs0,"I liked the movie a great deal, but there is one major thing that stopped me from enjoying the movie fully: I have no idea what Wonder Woman's powers are.

Obviously, over the course of the movie, Diana is progressively getting stronger and stronger. She starts off stronger than your average Amazon, quickly becomes able to leap long distances and punch through stone, eventually becomes able to topple buildings by running through them, and finally could stand toe to toe with a God. The progression of her strength made sense, as she faced great adversity her strength rose to match it, but I had no idea how durable she was. 

After the battle on the beach, Diana clearly has been hurt by a bullet. However, by the end of the movie she can walk through the incredibly deadly gas unharmed and walk off being punched through buildings.

If someone could let me know what the full extent of Wonder Woman's demigod powers are, I would love to know. Not understanding Wonder Woman's powers made it difficult to feel a sense of tension. Did Diana need to hide behind her shield as the machine gun focused fire on her, or could she technically walk forward unharmed? Could Diana take a couple hits from Ares' constructed swords, or did she really need to block every blow? And, if she wasn't durable enough to handle bullets and swords, how could she handle being punched through buildings and walking through gas that melts gas masks?

I would love some insight into this.

Overall I was a little disappointed, but I'm delighted other seems to enjoy it as much as they did. My biggest gripe is the ending.

Batman Vs Superman seemed to establish a timeline where Wonder Woman had become disillusioned with the world of man and wasn't trying to be a hero anymore.  But her journey and realization throughout this film seems to lead her to the opposite conclusion.

World War 2 was a horrible conflict that could have just as easily put her in that mindset, but the storytelling on the film just glosses over the ~80 years in between.",6erigc

Chris pine was really good and I liked their relationship. It was very believable.

The supporting cast was really good.  Loved the Amazons and Robin Wright as the general. The stunts they did were amazing and so badass.

Chris Pine's little band were quite funny although a bit underused. I really liked Lucy Davis as Etta even though she didn't have much to do. 

The villains were a bit weak to me. Dr Poison seemed to have no character development and just seemed like a plot vehicle to me. The china part of her face looked intriguing and I would have loved to know the story behind that.

David Thewlis  (in my opinion a very good and severely underrated actor) was really good but Ares as a villain was crap. His goal was flat and the part where hrs just standing there while Diana gets her sword was laughable.

The cgi was pretty good and I liked the slo mo parts. The lasso of truth looked a bit weird but I can live with that.

The accents were also bad, the Germans sounded like British, Gal Gadot also had like 3 different accents, although i did enjoy her performance.

Chris Pine was good , his chemistry with Gal was very nice and the romance didn't feel forced.

The other characters were very underwritten. 

The villains motivations were  clichéd , evil for the sake of being evil. When was the last time​ we had a good villain in a superhero movie anyway.

dicvr8f,"The most striking distinction, the one that separates Wonder Woman from the rest of the DCEU, is unusually that Diana is not referred to by that title within the film. This is a universe that has seen both Batman and Superman undergo periods of uncertainty, throwing the weight of the world at them, questioning if they be worthy enough to protest their cities on opposite sides of the bay. 

This is a universe where the alleged supervillains seem more willing to save a city, one that none of the come from, from an unquestionable evil. Wonder Woman does not trade in the moral queries of the previous entries, or at least it doesn't when it comes to its protagonist. Instead, Diana is Wonder Woman and there should be no question about this.

That simplicity can be seen in how Steve Trevor steals Doctor Poison's notebook. There is no complex scheme, he simply sees it and goes for it. This movie trades as a whole on that kind of simplicity, with regards to plot (Suicide Squad goes into Midnight City to rescue a high-value target who turns out to be Amanda Waller and then more helicopters go down as the team decides to go stop Enchantress, this ain't), but I don't want to imply that the movie is basic by any means.

It's smart, not in a Whedon kind of way, but in regards to gender roles and the subversion of those within a blockbuster. Written by Allan Heinberg, there are points,such as when Diana walks in on Steve exiting the bath or later when they depart for London. The dialogue here leans on low-hanging fruit for those scenarios, but there's a type of earnestness that comes through under the lens of Patty Jenkins. 

Andrew Sarris called this 'Interior Meaning', the conflict between the text the director works from, and they text that they create. The joke isn't on Diana, it might be played as humorous, but not for laughs directed at her. A similar notion applies to Sammy, Charlie and Chief. They might be stereotypes, but that's not why they're funny.

That same 'interior meaning' showed through last year in Batman v. Superman, when Gal ad-libbed the smile during the Doomsday fight. Now with the focus on here, she shines even more brightly than she did there. There's a determination that comes through in all of her actions and decisions and she plays confusion without an air of vapidity. With Chris Pine, they have a chemistry that runs as an undercurrent without them needing to say anything, demonstrating Jenkins' talent for non-verbal sequences and is easily the best comic book pairing since Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter.

If anything, this shows that a lot of the film's problems run on a script level. In fact, the issues present in this film –– exposition, underwritten supporting cast, third act that sorta forgets themes it considers, bad CGI –– are ones present in most superhero film. In the lead-up to this film, we were worries by the similarities to Captain America: The First Avenger and Thor, but instead it feels so fresh and that's a matter of perspective. 

Part of that is a disconnect from the wider DCEU, to the point that we don't see why Diana left Man's world (the movie would be better served without the framing sequence which causes more issues than it's worth). That hopefulness hasn't been seen in this universe before and the sheer desire to do good is frankly awe-inspiring. The battlefield to village sequence is such a perfect summation of the character and the highest point a comic book film has achieved since the character moments of Age of Ultron's third act.

Gadot embodies this character in a way that even fans of her previous appearance likely couldn't anticipate. In the third act, when this film is messiest, she (and her + Steve's story) remains a constant. It's an issue earlier on, but this film has bad CGI, more noticeable here because of some jittery editing. Really, it's not that Gal's acting has ever been flat per se, but instead that everything around her, background and elements, is flat.

I think we'd like comic book movies to be something more, it's why so many latched onto Logan for not being a CBM played straight in its first half, but we have to also recognise that when one wants to simply be a CBM where good stops evil and does that exceptionally well, then that's equally as deserving of praise. 

This is not a rehash of movies that Marvel made 6 years ago, but instead refreshing because of how it subverts those and fights against the traditions of the genre. It grants Steve an arc rather than letting him be the romantic interest only, a lesson which needs to be universally applied to the genre. When Jenkins shoots action wide instead of the industry-standard closeness, the phenomenal blocking and choreography gets shown off. It doesn't get lost in the weeds, postulating if Diana can wield the lasso like they wondered if Steve could with the shield, instead she simply does.

difq18m,"I absolutely loved this movie, Diana's innocence in the world was endearing, Steve's attempts to reign her in and his charm were very well done by Chris Pine.

The Veld/No Man's Land scene was incredible! They had really captured the impossibility of crossing NML, then Diana decides that, yes, she would actually like to cross it. 

A scene that I haven't seen get much praise was the beach battle between the Amazons and the Germans. The choreography was great, I just wish we'd seen **more** of how badass Antiope and Hippolyta were. 

Ares's intentions were a little unclear. He wants to destroy humanity but he's was promoting the Armistice, he wants to return the world to a paradies but is ok with devastating it first. I also feel like Diana and her mother were not regretful enough that she was leaving her paradise island unable to return.

Also, the mythology really bugged me. Zeus did not create Man. Prometheus created Man (and stole fire from Mt Olympus for them) and Zeus punished him by chaining him to a mountain to be pecked at by birds for eternity. Also, Ares was the father of both Hippolyta and Antiope. This was sloppy writing in an otherwise really good film.",6erigc

I really did think the 'message' of the film was the scene with Steve and Diana where he explains that maybe there's not a singular person they can defeat that makes everything better, that violence is a part of being human. It was a pretty realistic view and that scene was good. Then immediately Ares reveals himself as a singular person they can defeat that makes everything better just in time to have the generic CGI battle. The final confrontation itself was probably my least favourite part of the film. It was very generic and neither WW's or Ares' abilities were explained, Ares could do whatever he wanted it seemed like. There was a scene at No Man's Land where Diana was walking towards the camera and the CGI background looked REALLY bad. Also, Dr. Poison was a bit baffling.

- Diana felt like a complex character with some depth. Of course, it's not Shakespeare here, but she wasn't completely two-dimensional. There was growth and development there.

- Gadot smashed the role. She was a great choice. Hope she does more.

- Whole film felt like a regular huge, dumb, superhero movie. Much like Thor or Captain America. That it was a female director with a female lead wasn't really here nor there. Not relying on other supporting or cameo characters (excluding the Wayne reference at the start), it stood up on its own merit.

- During the scenes set in London, there was quite a few different nationalities present. Sikhs, British Indians, etc. It could so easily have been just white men everywhere but this little effort towards inclusion (and historical accuracy) was a nice touch.

- Conversely, the ""Chief"" stereotype (complete with smoke signals!) felt a little off.

- Action scenes were solid. Loved the scenes in the trenches and the part where she decides to get up and walk through No Man's Land were the standout scenes in the film or me.

- Last 20mins (ish) of the film were trash. Whole reveal of Ares, the cgi fight-fest, throwing lightning bolts between each other. It felt very hammy. I wasn't buying the God of War having a nasal posh British accent.

Everything else was really bad. Even the good parts were very cliched. Even the bit where she strode into No Man's Land felt forced and kinda clumsy when it was supposed to be this huge moment.

Everything about Ares was so fucking bad oh my god (not the actors' fault, mind)

Yet another movie that forces a romance with almost no set-up (the village part was better than you usually get here but still pretty garbo)

Extremely overrated. I couldn't see it sooner, so maybe this is my own fault, but my expectations were too high. I have a feeling this is some kind of reverse Ghostbusters effect. If you shoot it down, you're a sexist. It was good, but slightly boring. 

Positives - I thought Gal Gadot and Chris Pine were both excellent leads. 

Her theme tune is still badass. Would have liked it used a lot more.

Negatives - like I said, boring. Action scenes were good, but I feel if this had ""Directed by Zack Snyder"" 
plastered over it, the film would be shat on for its overuse of green screen and being too dark. The final battle looked straight out of BvS. 

And she gets her powers through love? Getthefuckouttahere! Didn't Interstellar get slammed for having this concept at it's core? I feel like this movie is bullet proof. In reality, it shits over Suicide Squad. Makes more sense than BvS but that film has some moments of Superhero brilliance, and nowhere near as good as Man of Steel. In my opinion.

Final thoughts - I'm glad it's doing so well because even though I didn't love it, I like the rest of the DCEU and want it to succeed. I'm glad Gal Gadot is smashing it as WW after so many people, myself included, didn't think she could pull it off. ",6erigc

This was one of the sloppiest hero movies ive ever seen. 

Every single fight scene you couldnt see what was going on because there were 8 jumpcuts per second.

But this dude went through a portal-like barrier to find wonder woman, saw her lift up a tank, jump 30 meters in the air, etc. its very obvious she has supernatural powers. It makes the possibility of ares existing very likely. 

Am i watching a superhero movie or a war movie?

CGI in the beginning where she was falling was atrocious. 

If the original bad guy didnt turn out to be ares after all, what the hell was the shit that he was breathing in to make him have powers like a god? It just turned out to be a magical smoke that gives super strength? C'mon man!

When she was translating the book, How the fuck did diana know what hydrogen and sulfur were? You could say well she knows all the languages and all so shes really smart. So she knows what elements are and all these languages but she doesnt even know what the custom of holding hands is? C'mon man!

Does no one give a shit that she had a bigass sword on her back? Barely even concealed by the dress?

Villain's motive was cheesier than pizza hut

At the end, the guy clearly said that blowing up the gas would kill wverything within 50 miles. FIFTH MILES. there is no fcking way he flew that plane up 50 miles before blowing up. He probably flew a few miles but theres no way it was 50 miles.

It's hard to compare to the dark knight trilogy because those were ""smart"" superhero movies, and this movie's plot is simple and clearly meant for as wide of an audience as possible. A better comparison would be something like the Avengers, a movie with tons of action and explosions and a mediocre plot. A friend of mine jokingly described the movie as a ""feminist avengers"", but it's actually kind of true. They don't shove the feminism in your face, either, but you sort of can't avoid it to some degree when you're making the first actually good female superhero film, possibly ever. The villain is kind of lame, especially if we're comparing him to Loki from the Avengers, but in my opinion Steve, Diana and the gang are wayy cooler heroes than many of the avengers were, despite the fact that none of them but Steve and Diana got as much screentime as they deserved.

Gal Gadot owned the role of Wonder Woman too, holy shit. I mean, I was excited for this movie specifically because WW was one of the only good parts of Batman v Superman, but by god did she come into it in a whole other way in this movie. No spoilers, but when you finally see her in the full Wonder Woman outfit, going into battle, she feels like an actual, real life wonder woman. Ben affleck and Henry cavill are both good, but forgettable interpretations of their respective characters, but Gal Gadot simply IS wonder woman after this film.

8.5/10. It's no cinematic masterpiece, but I highly recommend the movie to anyone looking for epic action scenes and larger-than-life heroes to root for, with a simple, easy to follow plot.",6erigc
dicixkk,I absolutely loved the movie. One thing I noticed was that WW had a warehouse scene almost parallel to Batman's warehouse scene in BVS. Could this be the DC equivalent to Marvel Netflix's long hallway scenes?,6erigc

did6ezb,"So I just got back from the theater. Here's my take:

- Pine and Gadot killed it. They are way better than any of the Suicide Squad and the supporting cast of BvS.

- Action sequences were good except for the last one which was really predictable.

- Music was meh, I know you can't compare Rupert Gregson-Williams to Hans Zimmer but at least he kept the theme.

- It was a little cliche and felt like a First Avenger clone at times but still pretty watchable.

- It was better paced than any other DCEU movie and also had more emotion instead of action.

- The CGI was shaky but the set pieces were gorgeous

Overall, not a bad movie. It's worth a rewatch, isn't too boring, and it definitely builds the character. It's miles better than SS and BvS still doesn't match the best that Marvel has or Man of Steel (I liked it, sue me), but if DC continues in this direction it's definitely going to catch up soon.  
",6erigc
did8xgz,"I saw it last night and here is my take: (minor spoilers)

I noticed much with DC movies if you really take the effort to put yourself into the shoes of the characters, it mostly pays off to help understand what the characters are actually going through and thinking. (I do this everytime I watch MoS and get so much more out of it, especially when considering what his parents are dealing with, but that's another tangent).

For me, what stands out with this film is how the movie is experienced through Diana's eyes. The movie does an excellent job of this. This alone makes it worth watching again.
There is a lot of depth here alone and, at least for me, I felt I was witnessing her character grow.

This is also one of the best movies I have ever seen handle a character that is a ""fish out of water"". This movie didn't get cliche or stupid with a character witnessing the real world for the first time and doesn't over do it.

The story is solid, and also SIMPLE. Not stupid simple. What I mean it's not conviluted . I loved MoS, I really liked BvS, but there is simply too much story in those movies.
This movie is beautifully concise.

This feature is also a movie for women. There are elements scattered throughout that I feel speaks directly for women, but it doesn't accomplish this by berating men in the process.
Again, this is something else done great elegance.

I loved Themescyra, and I wanted more of that. That's just myself being greedy though. The movie needs to get her the real world, and it seems to take just enough time to get that rolling.

There are some cliche elements, but they are handled beautifully. The 'rag tag' group of misfits helping out Steve Trevor for one.  They were entertaining, but not overly comedic.

Nothing in this movie is shoved down your throat.

The weakest part of this film is the villains.  I loved Dr. Poison. I wanted more of her. A bit more of her background would have been very enjoyable.
In addition, I wanted more graphic violence. If you haven't watched the Animated Wonder Woman movie, you'll know what I mean. The animated feature spoiled me in comparison to this movie. It's not the movies fault because I felt the kept a gore/blood factor down to not detract from the tone of the movie, but I wanted at least one beheading.

The special effects were OK in some parts. Some scenes reminded me of the Hulk jumping around.
However, the director said in each WW action scene, there was meaning behind it. Diana learns something from each encounter, and in a few of those scenes its' quite apparent.
You can actually see her gain confidence in certain aspects.

I didn't care for the final 'reveal', but I liked the last action sequence. 

This movie felt more like a 'movie' than a comic book movie, and in an odd way I missed that 'comic book' feel. 
Nothing in this film feels forced, going through the motions, or over the top ridiculous, at least for me.

That being said, this movie can stand right up there with the best of super hero movies without question, and in my opinion, there aren't many of them.

Speaking of Ares, his fight scene peaked when he actually had the armor. That bit when he was carving out the eye holes? Dude! The rest of the time he was just a slow wizard boss fight guy, which was a bit underwhelming (if fitting, given his previous roles). 

Anyway, I suppose the love bit was inevitable, but I found it to be tastefully done. It didn't seem to take over the whole film or serve as Diana/Wonder Woman's sole motivation or character trait.

But they established that the timer was long enough to make it to England, because they showed a map with a red line going to England, and then had England circled a bunch of times. 

So I'm supposed to believe that flying a plane straight up in the air over a populated area, and then blowing it up and letting the gas dissipate into the atmosphere was a better option than flying it over/into the ocean?

Yet, the color palette of the movie is different and fits a Wonder Woman film very yell. Gal Gadot is a fantastic Diana and brings so much charm and charisma. The movie wouldn't work as well without Gadot. Chris Pine is good as well and has great chemistry with Gal. Their is too much slow-mo in the beginning. Also Ares is a passable villain. My gripe with him is that he wasn't developed well enough to leave a lasting impact. Dr. Poison and Ludendorff were fine as well. Overall, I was thoroughly satisfied with Wonder Woman, and it was sure worth the wait.

It gripped me from the start with the world building but it seemed to descend into your typical superhero origin that we've seen *so* many of with a relatively weak villain and 25+ minute end battle. I was happy to leave in the 3rd act. That said I did find it OK and as said by many others, the No Man's Land scene was worth the price of admission alone.   ",6erigc
digq93t,"I thought it was alright, overall.  Better than expected?

Gadot is really gorgeous so that helps.  
It was a little weird how she gained strength as the movie went, but I guess that goes back to what Robin Wright (lvl50 Archer) was telling her about holding back?  But no way that meth'd up JazzMan should have been tossing her around like he did.  She was just knocking down clock towers and ramming armored vehicles.

I liked Chris Pine in this.  I think he'd be an amazing Sterling Archer if it ever went live.

I did not like the last ten mins. of the movie.  Love?  Come on.  She's the Goddess of Truth (and Goddess of War now), and her stupid fall back to the movie trope made me grind my teeth a little.

Overall, a good start, I guess.

dikcliz,"I need to rewatch Man of Steel to be certain, but I'd agree that Wonder Woman is probably the best DC film. Nevertheless, that doesn't say much as it is still severely lacking in certain areas, although that cannot be said of the film's first act, which is easily the best material from any DC film. The beginning was actually quite interesting and mostly well done, particularly the depiction of the Amazons and their society. I wish that more emphasis was put on comparing the Amazon society with the world that the Amazons had left behind, as this is an actually novel concept to the superhero genre that could've benefitted from a proper exploration. I also feel like the film would've been much more interesting if it had focused on Diana's personal journey with the use of WWI as a backdrop, rather than the other way around. As previously mentioned, her background is a new one for the genre, but it doesn't get nearly as much attention as it deserves.

Unfortunately, the remainder of the film drops this element and instead chooses to double down on the brutal nature of war. However, the film ultimately bungles this as well, as it fails to have any compelling insight other than ""war is bad."" To the surprise of no one, Ares is lackluster and ultimately unnecessary, as his presence fails to provide anything worthwhile to the story that Ludendorff doesn't. It also undercuts the tension that develops from wondering if Ludendorff is Ares, only to discover that he isn't, consequently shattering Diana's idealistic view of humanity. Having Ares attempt to sway her to his side creates hollow tension, since there is virtually no doubt that he will be unsuccessful, and ultimately provides nothing to the theme of humanity's capacity for both good and evil.

Steve's struggle of reconciling his own capacity for good and evil is weak, since we never actually see him do anything morally questionable. The closest we get is that he tells Diana that they don't have time to help the displaced civilians, but this is proven to be true, as the villagers would not have been rescued if not for Diana's presence. Thus, his sacrifice at the end is noble, but lacks the punch that it could have, since there's nothing to really redeem him from. Also, his romantic relationship with Diana is extremely forced and unnecessary, doing nothing to improve either character or the film as a whole.

As for the action scenes, the overuse of slow motion was a significant detriment, as it suffers from the usual desensitization that comes with amping everything to 11 all the time. The fight choreography was passable, but I've been severely spoiled by the latter two Captain America films such that WW ultimately fails to impress. The climax with Ares is especially awful, as it approaches Man of Steel levels of excess.

That said, the film does have some good moments. Gal Gadot is capable as Diana, and her characterization is sufficient for your standard super hero film. Most of the more light hearted scenes were nice, even if they detracted from the more interesting aspects of the film. The scene between Ludendorff and Dr. Poison as they kill the German officials was a memorable moment, as it showed a surprising dimension to villains than pure evil. Cutting out Ares and focusing more on their relationship would've greatly improved things on the villain front. All in all, it demonstrates that DC is finally starting to learn how to best construct its cinematic universe, but I just hope that the overblown critical reception doesn't get to their heads and make them believe that they've finally done a good job, because they still have a ways to go before they approach Marvel's standard.

The movie faltered after that. I just thought the third act was another CGI clusterfuck. I kinda cringed when Area ""suited up"". That entire fight scene between the two felt just like the MOS and bvs ending fight scenes with just different characters CGIed in.

Secondly I was really hoping for some lesbianism from Diana, as a gay man myself.

Suicide Squad I thought was an absolute mess and an unenjoyable movie to sit through.

diciqmg,"Here's my initial take on the film. This list is not definite and please feel free to disagree or make additions:
**PROS**
* The fight choreography was really good

* The Amazons and by extension Themyscira were portrayed really well

* The reveal of [Ares was a surprising and quite intelligent reveal](#spoiler) 

* Well written and well acted, Gal Gadot was excellent and very effectively conveyed Diana's Naivety and Innocence

* The humour for the most part felt natural and worked well

* The 'passive' CGI was really good

* The film handled the horrors of war like PTSD rally well without making it a big deal

* Wonder Woman was awesome, her abilities and skill was demonstrated amazingly and truly shows her as a force to be reckoned with.


**CONS**

* In my opinion it didn't play well with the other films in terms of Lore, establishing the Idea of Gods and creation muddies the waters and raises a lot of questions

* The CGI in the final fight was average at best

* Wonder Woman's theme was very underutilised, particularly in key battle scenes

* Explaining that [Wonder Woman is essentially a God bordered on Mary Sue territory. It also made me wonder why she couldn't kill Doomsday, considering she kills a literal God](#spoiler)

* After [Ares dies, what bout World War 2? That does prove Steve right after all. I still feel that that should be explained at some point because World War 2 was a hell of a lot worse than the first. Did Diana just not give a shit?](#spoiler)

TL;DR A solid film, not without its discrepancies, enjoyable nonetheless. 7/10

The best action scene was the No Man's Land but only because it was clearly shot in my opinion. The other action scenes were constantly hindered by cuts where it just didn't feel smooth. Also the amount of times where CGI was clearly obvious and it just sticks out, was bothering me. 

That third act though, felt odd...I have no idea what it is about that third act that's throwing me off but it's weird..

The interaction between Diana and Steve were great. 

It's a great movie but again the action CGI was so obvious it kept ruining my immersion

Oh and when Diana goes for her sword against Aries but she doesn't have it. So it cuts away to Steve, then when it cuts back to Diana she drops back down with the Sword and Aries is just standing. What the fuck was that!?

Gal Gadot stole the show in BvS and stole my heart in this film. I like WW because she doesn't take no shit and instead of monologuing she just gets in there and beats that ass. Even when she went to kill Luggendorf or whatever his name is, she went directly to where he was at without alerting the guards instead of causing a huge scene like every other hero would have done.

They didn't do cheesy shit or make long drawn out explanations for tools. Everything just kind of hit the ground urunning once Chris Pine showed up. I wish rthey would've showed more of the life on her island or of the ancient war but i'm content with what we got.

Action scenes were off the fuckin chain. When she threw that tank or destroyed that church or went super saiyan on dat boi I almost lost my shit.

diez04w,"Caught it last night. It's a solid 9/10 in my book.

IMO the film was brought down a bit by two things. The first was the opening bed-time story sequence that served as an exposition dump for the Gods and Ares/Zeus etc. It went on too long and the delivery of ""hearts of men corrupted by Ares"" was too direct. I can't help but feel that if they just made passing reference to Diana's lineage and a more subtle reference to Ares it would have improved that whole sequence. Fortunately this occurs early enough in the film that it doesn't significantly impact your enjoyment of the movie.

The second thing was the ending monologue... I couldn't believe they actually said ""love will save the world........."" It just came off a bit too heavy handed... as if the director didn't quite trust that the message had gotten across in the climax of the film. I assure you, it already did! IMO if they had just ended it with no monologue - just have Diana type her Thank You to Bruce Wayne in the email and then have her leap into action at the end that would have been perfect.

Besides those two bookends though, the middle ~90% of the film is absolutely fantastic. Gadot and Pine have great chemistry and the movie hits pretty much every single emotion. It's funny, it's thrilling, it's romantic, sad, and yet also hopeful all at once.",6erigc

dikffhy,"This is about a week late, but I just saw the movie tonight. I feel as most likely do that this movie had to be good for the DCEU to truly continue. Whether you liked the previous films or not, you can't deny the low critic ratings. Wonder Woman had to succeed to renew people's faith in DC. 

And I think it did. 

Now, going in, despite knowing critic reviews were mostly positive, I still kept an open mind. I still had to find out if I liked it, personally. So, here's what I thought: it was good, but not great. 

There are good things and bad things about the movie in my opinion.  The good was definitely in the characters--the good characters that is. Diana was wonderful, and Gal Gadot killed it. Pine's Steve was great as well, and the chemistry between he and Diana was appealing. The story, overall, was good, simple, and still deep and thoughtful. There's one exception, but I'll get to that. I enjoyed the Ares reveal and thought the poison doctor was an excellent red herring. 

But with that comes some of the bad as well. As many others have said, the villains of the movie were very underdeveloped. I knew nothing really about the poison doctor, and I still don't. Ares' motivation was to cause war...because he's Ares? There may have been details I missed, but I don't think missable details would change much. Now, the exception to the story I mentioned has to do with Ares. Diana believed throughout most of the film that the general was Ares and after killing him the war would end. Then she does kill the general and the war continues. Steve tells her that maybe there is no Ares, that people just possess the potential for evil all on there own.  Someone mentioned here that this would have been a good spot to end the movie. I agree. It would have been intriguing, but of course I would have been disappointed with the lack of a better fight and yet still torn about a thoughtful ending. Then the real Ares revealed himself and talked about how he influenced people, and I thought, okay, sure he's been stirring up trouble because he likes war. If Diana kills him, the war might continue, but without Ares calling the shots, things will be much smoother. This was what I expected to happen all the through the fight until Ares was defeated. But then something odd happened, when Ares was killed, all the German soldiers were happy and relieved as if they really were under Ares' control. But see, I thought the evil was within people, as Steve said. But of course, maybe he was wrong, and Diana was right the whole time. But if that's the case, what caused ww2? The Vietnam war? The Iraq war? If Ares was dead, there shouldn't be more wars. Right?

My only other problem with the movie was the slow motion it's used...so...much. Whenever I saw the slow motion, I thought to myself that it probably would have looked much cool and much more choreographed in real time or spend up. When a fight is fast, you're on the enlarge of your seat, and just when you're surprised by something--""did she just break a gun on her back?""--you're already onto the next think. The slow motion was used so much that I couldn't handle it anymore. 

Anyway that's all for now. Those are my thoughts. 

TL;DR WW was good, not great. ",6erigc
dikpoq0,"The only complaint I have is of the final battle and what Ares does in the story.

I don't mind the whole Ares backstory, it was actually pretty cool how they put in the Greek myth part into the cinematic universe and I'd rather they not leave the Greek gods in the story. It's kind of weird how Ares can get zapped off Mount Olympus and end up all weak and scrawny but then come back and kill all of them, but that's a minor nitpick.

What I'm annoyed at is how the fight went after that twist that Ludendorff isn't actually Ares and that killing Ares doesn't actually solve anything.

Ares's plan is exactly like Zod's. Try to convince the hero to turn against humans because humans aren't like them and they can build a new world for themselves that is a paradise for them but Man of Steel does it better because it makes sense for Superman to betray humans. Wonder Woman's sole purpose is to kill Ares, how does he even expect her to join his side? The one thing Ares did though is remember to show the happy image and not drown her in the skulls of humans.

It would've been much better if he just came in and went all out like Doomsday, since she's the only one who can kill him, why leave her alive? She's heavily outmatched anyway because of all his powers. According to what little research I did of Ares apparently he gets power from conflict, and with The Great War he should be at the height of his power.

Also, the Ares casting was shit. Why not cast a big badass superhero looking guy? Ares is supposed to be this imposing guy but then he looks like an average uncle.",6erigc
dily0c7,"I honestly thought it was pretty good and it showed that not all DC movies need to be dark (suicide squad tried but honestly imo it was the weakest of the DC Universe movies). Unlike batman vs superman and suicide squad which tried to do too much and felt all over the place, wonder woman tells a straightforward story about her origin and her battle during WW 1. The action scenes in this movie were great with the exception of the overuse of slow motion which could honestly get really annoying. The thing which surprised me about this movie was honestly how humorous it was at many points, this movie was honestly pretty funny almost making you feel as though you are watching a marvel movie. The only things I really had a problem with besides the slow motion was the ending and the antiwar message felt they were beating us over the head with it. The ending is the only thing keeping me from saying wonder woman is a great film  7.5/10

Spoiler Alert
[When wonder woman defeats the fake Ares and she is shocked as she sees the war still going. Steve tells her the war cannot be ended by killing one man. I honestly thought this would have been a great twist, but then Ares and has the worst fight scene in the entire film. Wonder woman defeats him with the power of love and it all just felt so anticlimactic. I still highly recommend the film though, we do not know how long it will be until we get another great DC universe film.](#spoiler)

This was the origin movie they had to have for her, to introduce the character to the more casual audience. I think they played it a little safe in places, but overall it worked. Arguably the best DC film so far for story, structure and acting. Gadot is fantastic as Diana and has a strong, likable supporting cast.

In general this movie shows that D.C. could have some good properties on their hands if Zack Snyder wasn't in charge of them. His Ayn Rand influence doesn't work in a universe with Superman and Wonder Woman who do things because it's right. It works for Batman because he's a neocon superhero though. ",6erigc

My biggest problem was that whenever the film looked like it'd do something interesting it would u turn down cliche superhero trope lane instead. Like how it looked like Diane would be forced to accept that Aries wasn't behind the war and that people don't only do bad things against their will or because they're being controlled by a supreme evil. It's a great comment on morality and the greyness of war, but oh no a big evil God had to be revealed for Wonder Women to fight in over the top fashion. 

The final monologue was also hilariously cheesy and some of the effects were a bit iffy. Overall not a bad film by any stretch but nothing special or worth rushing out to see, probably on a level with Man of Steel for me. ",6erigc
die74w0,"Just got back from seeing Wonder Woman. I saw it with my closest friend--she's in her fifties, I'm 29. We went out and bought little cheap plastic WW tiaras to wear. We cried and cheered through the whole thing. 

I'm amazed and so happy that this film was made. It makes me feel proud to be a woman, and I was thinking about all the amazing women in my life as I watched it. I know it's just a movie meant to make money, but seeing those Amazons framed as heroes, seeing Diana come to life onscreen after so long? The strength and leadership on display, undiluted by a tale of victimization that so many heroines have to carry? 

Fucking glorious. It meant everything to us.

And as a gay woman, this movie was just full of coded imagery, which was a nice bonus, though I wish they could have gone further in showing that the island had romantic love. 

I also loved that DC actually let one of their superheroes be fucking *hopeful* and *bright* for once. A little cheesy optimism is as much a part of comics as darkness is, and it didn't detract from WW's challenges or pathos. I want the cheese! I want what I loved about these heroes as a kid to come through and meet up with what I love about them as an adult. It can be done!

As far as I'm concerned, they did right by the character. I couldn't be happier. I really needed this during a tough year. It's so amazing to sit in a theatre and feel like a movie is speaking directly to you.

diczyvh,"Saw it last night here are my general thoughts:

- It's definitely an ""audience movie"". By that I mean many moments that I enjoyed in the theatre(Trench battle, Ares Fight) might not be as awesome just randomly watching it on Netflix.




- Gal and Chris had good chemistry together. Chris' comedic timing was also used to its fullest. Gal played the role with same sincerity that I feel Chris Evans uses in Captain America.



- While it has it's gloomy moments, it's not nearly the Debbie Downer that was BvS(and I liked a lot of things in BvS). I liked that it seemed to keep its tone consistent...



- However, towards the end there's a lot of shifting locations and it seems like the ending was a little forced. It doesn't ruin the move, but it was noticeable.



- CONCLUSION: While it may not be the best to compare the MCU to DCU, I feel the best way I can sum it up is this: 



Take the crazy myth stuff and the fish out of water story from Thor 1 + The atmospheric tone of Captain America 1(I know its WWI not WWII) = Wonder Woman.



Overall I'd give it a solid B+/A-",6erigc
did42n7,"I have a huge girl crush on Gal Gadot. I mean she's not just gorgeous, her every little facial expression is on point, really shows the immature, reckless, and teenage-girl-like Wonder Woman. The Zack Snyder trace is obvious, too. Which makes the action consequences and visual aesthetics really appealing to me -- all the Amazon warriors look so good, kudos to the fight choreographers and casting team. 

This sounds really embarrassing but I was literally crying from beginning to end, overwhelmed by all these strong, elegant looking women on the screen.

For a movie about a superhero from a matriarchal society directed by a woman there was actually very little to no man bashing and spent most of the film time commenting on the horrors and consequences of war...something Captain America wanted to do but failed to do successfully. It was actually a very well crafted period piece about the first world war except with bullet stopping bracelets, greek gods , and magic. 

The only thing that bothered me was that Chris Pine was too damn HOT! He was so gorgeous, smooth, chiseled and perfect that I actually hated how perfect he was.

Gal and Chris had wonderful chemistry on screen together and I wish Chris could have stayed with the franchise some how. There were two particular things I did not like about the film, while I felt the scenes in Themyscira were important they at times seemed cheesy and the acting seemed a bit off. The other problem I had was with the film was the final fight between Diana and Ares, the amount of CGI was obnoxious and hard on the eyes it reminded me heavily of the BvS fight where the Trinity team up to fight Doomsday and it left a bad taste in my mouth.

Cons

- None of her recklessness had consequence. The trench scene would have had more impact if someone on her side got hurt or killed.  

- The flying away in a plane with a doomsday device was way too close to Captain America. 

- Painted WWI Germans kinda like nazi's with the enslavement and what not.

I didn't like Chris Pine in this role.  He played his typical Mr Suave and really seemed to degrade WW's performance.  I only started liking him as a character when he revealed that he basically used WW and played along with her goals in order to make his easier.  Then he had depth.  Until then he was just a Marty sue.

Minor issue, but overall this was one of the best D.C./Marvel movies I've seen in years.  It was miles ahead Man of Steel and Dawn of Justice.  What's not to love about proto-Nazis getting smacked down by warrior princesses?  I showed up to the theatre for Gal Gadot (who absolutely KILLED and is a goddess even when she isn't playing WW). But it ended up having a lot of depth and range of topics, even touching on PTSD (Charlie) and the futility/irony of war (Chief talking about the Americans taking land from his people.)

The trailers are partly at fault because I feel like I'd already seen most of the major scenes, and the plot was so straightforward that the movie seemed like the film adaptation of a book I'd already read.

I really like Chris Pine and Gal Gadot but I absolutely can't stand the gritty, dark tone of the DC movies and it looks like they're all going to be that way. It does nothing for me except take the fun away. DC can't seem to make a movie that isn't formulaic and totally drab. I wasn't expecting to be bored with this one but I found myself wanting it to end way before the credits rolled, and some of the action scenes dragged on and on.

And one more thing: I am so sick of watching movies full of characters speaking English with some forced 
European accent. It's so contrived and for some reason it just irritates me.

 All characters, especially Diana herself was really really likeable. Now likeable supee heroes are not rare but Wonder Woman was not only likeable. Throughout the film, I actually build a connection with the character. I cared about what happened to her, I got happy when she was etc.

Now this is something that I haven't experienced in a Comic book movie since the original Spiderman trilogy. Yes, I love characters like Iron man, Superman, Batman, Captain America etc. But I never build a connection with them in their movies. Wonder Woman actually feels more human than all of them, which is ironic, considering her origins. Both the writing and the acting makes her a believable and a fun character. So when she kicks ass, I got more excited than if it had been done by someone else. She just feel real. And the side characters are also (mostly) really fun, which makes this movie stand out for me.

I really liked this movie. Like most people, I was initially and inherently skeptical of a DCEU movie, but they nailed this. Gadot and Pine were perfect casting choices. Gadot, in particular, proved so many doubters wrong. The plot, costuming, and backstory were good. The source material is inherently corny so some things can be forgiven. 

The only thing that felt jarring to me was the transition from WW in training to WW being an unstoppable juggernaut. I felt like one minute she was portrayed as just slightly better than her Amazon sparring partners, and then she doesn't even really contribute to the beach battle. The next time she's in action she is leaping tall structures, kicking people through walls, and deflecting bullets on reflex. Obviously, that's what WW is supposed to be capable of, but I feel there is a plot hole there, given that the Amazons never even explain to Diana what she really is.",6erigc
didbmt8,"I liked it a lot, I wouldn't say it's a great movie, but it is a very good one, mostly. Gal Gadot, and Chris Pine were both excellent, they did a great job on their own, and also had great chemistry together. And I enjoyed pretty much everything about Themyscira, and the boat, and London, and the war, and when they start to wax philosophical a bit I thought it made some interesting realizations, and also made for good character moments for WW, and while there are some little things here and there that could have been done better they are just that, little things.

The one thing that holds the movie back from greatness though in my opinion unfortunately is Ares, everything about the movie is great, except for the parts relating to him, and I don't mean he just wasn't good but I thought he was actually handled poorly, and in my opinion they could have easily made it in such a way that all that great discussion about morality, and the nature of man, and Ares' actual influence on war could have still been there, totally maintained, enhanced even, but have him be a more credible threat, and interesting villian. I think the character would have been done much better if they went with a more traditional version of him where he, as the god of war, is powered by war, and so has a very personal interest in the war continuing, and can use his shape shifting powers to manipulate people. I think setting the movie slightly earlier in the war would have also helped him a lot actually. For one the fact that the war is going to end tomorrow kind of makes him seem ineffective as a catalyst of war, so Ares kind of comes across as just a glorified arms dealer rather than a credible threat to the world. So by setting it earlier in the war when fighting was much more intense I think the no man's land scene would have had a lot more impact in many ways, not that it didn't, it was a good scene but it would have had more, including building Ares up by showing how powerful he would be from a war of that magnitude, and also having WW (and audience I suppose) be shocked by the scale of war that he had created. It should have been the most intense fighting they could have imagined, which would have also made the realization that man is doing that to themselves even more impactful. To be fair there were scenes where that shock moment happens, when they gas the town is the big one, but I think it would have worked better in the battle that way it isn't just the evil Germans doing bad things, it's everyone. Setting it earlier in the war would have also allowed them to make Ares a more successful manipulator, there's a lot of talk in the movie about how it's a bad idea to go taking out random generals in the middle of peace negotiations, but nothing comes of it, and I think it would have been fantastic if that was actually Ares' plan, and the general was a patsy, and by killing him the talks breakdown and the war continues. And maybe some of this came down to them wanting to tread carefully about WW1, but if that's the case i'd say they were overly cautious to the detriment of the film. I still liked it quite a lot though.",6erigc
didzl7o,"I thought this movie was just ok. Better than the other DCEU movies, but nothing particularly special. I'm not really a fan of the visual style during the CGI heavy scenes. It made the movie seem cheap and corny is some parts, especially during the more dramatic moments during the final fight. The first half of the movie was kind of boring. It could have used a few more action scenes.

Gal Gadot is fine as WW. She had a little too much ""babe in the woods"" thing going on for me. I like the more aggressive versions of WW shown in other DC properties. But that's more of a personal preference than a complaint. 

Ares would have been more interesting without the unnecessary reveal. Will he come back for WWII?",6erigc

She was casted perfectly as wonder woman. The story was good and the action scenes were phenomenal. No Mans Land is one of the best superhero fight scenes ive seen. its up there with the winter soldiers elevator scene. 

great movie with a great story and great performances. I hope DC can learn what they did right with this one and keep it going. ",6erigc
dieiisf,"I liked this movie a lot.  It was for me easily the best of the Snyder-verse DC movies (high bar I know).

Patty Jenkins did a good job directing this and her and the writers made some intelligent decisions with the character that I'll touch on later.

I liked the use of colours juxtaposing bright, verdant panoramas of Themyscera against the greys of war-torn Europe.  I enjoyed the melee combat scenes, I thought they were well choreographed and the action was fun in general.

In terms of characterisation I really liked they did not fall on the same tropes you see whenever a movie feels like it has to build up a strong female hero.  There was no hokey scene where some attempted rapist/s got their comeuppance.  There was no emasculating of Steve Trevor (men in these types of movie generally get turned into damsels in distress).  I thought at one point they going with the ""I am your father"" route with WW's origins.

I was also pleasantly surprised by the cast.  Chris Pine was entertaining and charismatic, previously he had bored me with a general lack of talent in other roles I have seen him in.

I also felt the same with way with Gadot as Diana.  I never understood the praise she got for her role in BvS, she did nothing but smile, look pretty and strike superhero poses.  Here she gets to attempt a range of emotions and hits the mark pretty well.  Her outburst at others' lack of action felt earnest.  She looked entranced when seeing Trevor for the first time.  She did sorrow and grief without it looking cheesy.  This movie would have fallen apart if her performance did not match the material.

For my dislikes, I was underwhelmed by the use of Ares.  It seemed to be a waste to use ""The God of War"" as a throwaway villain in the first movie, he did, afterall, appear to be the driving force behind the Amazons retreating from the world.  It didn't help that he was played by a very un-intimidating actor.  I just thought he should have been a villain they build up to in WW3 (for example).

The climactic showdown with him was also my least favourite action sequence of the film.  Too CGI heavy when I think a more knock-down, drag-em-out brawl between WW and Ares would have been more entertaining.

I also have a nitpick about the Godkiller power.  Why didn't Zeus just use that power on Ares in the first place?

Apart from rounding out some numbers, I also didn't feel Sammy, Charlie and Chief contributed anything of meaning to the film.

As I've said though, I enjoyed this and if you're a fan of good action movies I recommend seeing this.",6erigc

digzjtw,"Loved the movie, with one minor issue:

Did they write themselves into a corner regarding WW's power level?  Ares says she is the godkiller because she is a god like him, and only a god can kill another.

dih5sqb,"Steve's in superhero movies and large planes filled with deadly explosives do not mix. 

But seriously, this is the best of the nuDC films so far. I give it a solid B+, which RT seems to be trending toward right now. 

The supporting casts' acting was great. Chris Pine provided a great dynamic to Gal Gadot's, shall we say, slightly wooden way of playing Wonder Woman? I love Gadot in the action side of the role, but she wasn't consistent with expressing emotions throughout the movie. She seemed most sincere during the shopping scene and when she realized she had god-like strength on the Tower of Gifts. It worked out, though, because Pine was more fluid than her, and that blended well when he reacted to her actions.

I've had friends rate the film higher than I am, so I'll have to list my other quibble: The green screen. Either I saw a side effect of seeing the film in 2D when backgrounds were done with the 3D version in mind, or it was really as bad as it looked.

When I say ""bad,"" I mean backgrounds are noticeably and painfully easy to trace when presented behind Wonder Woman, and it always seemed to be her shots. Some effects are unavoidable, like taking out an entire church steeple, but walking down an airfield runway with a sunrise behind you? There has got to be a way for Warner Brothers to move away from the cartoony look and get more realistic shots out of the studios they're using.  However, the No Man's Land sequence (before the village) and a majority of the beach battle didn't suffer. Maybe it all comes down to lighting.

Like I said, though, I was still able to enjoy the film, although rating DC films by how little I sigh at something is not the way I want to evaluate these movies. The Justice League trailer that played before the movie has me a little worried.

P.S. David Thewlis was a nice surprise. I had no idea he was in the movie, and the turn with him was well done. The ending for him wasn't as good as it could have been, but I believe it would not have gone as well in Danny Huston's hands.",6erigc
dilj190,"It was a decent movie, and definitely DC's best so far. The best aspect of the movie was the character dynamics. I really enjoyed the scenes where the group went on a mission together. 

I wasn't a fan of Ares actually being in the movie, let alone be the main bad guy. With how the first act was set up, I figured the point was to show her the world was a lot more complicated than just good and evil. I felt like the movie's message would have made more sense if it was just her learning throughout the film that people in general are morally grey and that pinning men's evildoing on Ares' influence was a naive thought after all. Missed opportunity, but I guess she needed someone to fight at the end ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Anyway, went to see the movie with my Son tonight and I agree with many posters. Easily, by miles and miles, the best DC movie since The Dark Knight. Head and shoulders above BvS and SS. I just wish DC would stop rushing these movies out. Marvel played it 100% spot on and played the long game. DC and WB just want to rush it all but they'll run out of steam with a far shorter movie roster than marvel have. Have Patience DC and WB. If you make them, they will come.

Also, absolute SHAME on Marvel Studios that they STILL haven't had a female led film in nearly TEN years yet DC manage one as their fourth film. (MoS, BvS and SS if I'm counting correctly).

But overall I liked it.",6erigc
dicqskt,"I am honestly shocked looking at all the extremely positive reviews after seeing the film for myself.

In my opinion Wonder Woman was very meh.
The story I thought was stronger and executed much better than the other DCEU films before it. Although I do believe towards the end it starts to stumble on itself.

The acting was decent, but I didn't feel like anyone really won me over or pulled much emotion out of me with their performances.
There were a lot of cheesy lines and I don't feel like anyone in those roles delivered them in a way that was believable.

The action/fight scenes had some neat ""moments"", but that was really all they were...moments. The majority of the action is a gratuitous amount of cgi. This movie will age terribly in that department. I'm not sure if the actors just weren't capable or what. When the action is up close its cutting so fast you can't really tell what is happening, and when its further away its completely obvious cgi. It took me out of the movie constantly. From the first moment she [uses her bracelets](#spoiler) I thought to myself""Oh no...this is not a good sign"" and what do you know? By the end fight, the movie had become a video game cutscene.

The humor...I don't know exactly how they got it so wrong. Usually when lines that are meant to be funny are delivered, they are done so in beats, there is a rhythm to it. Timing and editing matter and they can make or break a joke. Aside from two, maybe three lines, it's almost as if the people behind this film have never seen it done properly. It felt like just about every joke was falling flat on its face. No one laughed in my theater. A particular scene early on in the film [Steve Trevor in the springs](#spoiler) I know is aiming to be funny but the music clashes with the tone and the timing of the delivery is non-existent. Long, awkward pauses that completely destroy the laugh factor.

Like all of the other movies that preceded it, the color once again is completely muted and really kills the excitement that you should be feeling while seeing Wonder Woman on the big screen!

Had a lot of these issues been resolved I think this could have been a phenomenal movie. I've seen so many other similar movies without nearly the amount of hiccups this one has. It really does bum me out that the first big female superhero movie is so generic and sloppy.

tl;dr: 5/10
Acting decent but cheesy at times.
Story was slightly above average.
Action is poorly done, either super choppy or cgi-fest.
Comedy bits land right on their face due to awkward timing and editing.",6erigc
dicgr8y,"OK, it is not a perfect film but with [Wonder Woman]( https://tldrmoviereviews.com/2017/06/02/movie-review-wonder-woman-2017/) I think DC finally found its groove. 

It had compelling characters, the emotional moments felt earned not forced, the story has a logical progression to it, and it felt like it was true to the comics yet updated for a modern audience.  

However, I did have some issues, like it really felt like it was meant to be set in WW2 but they changed it to WW1 to avoid Captain America comparisons but some things just don’t work in the move. Also, some points were a bit predictable like David Thewlis being Aries which I picked the first time he was on screen. 

But overall good work DC/WB and I really hope you take this and apply it to Justice League.

diorg21,"This was a decent movie but I don't think it deserves the acclaim I see it getting. 

Pros: I thought the fight cinematography was hype. Especially in the town and I loved the scenes on the Amazon Isle. Chris Pine and Gal Gadot do a fantastic job in their respective roles. Their characters were also well written and I appreciated the dialogue from both naive Diana and awkward but confident Steve. The weird dreary colors the DC movie universe seems to have really works for this film. The story is a bit simple but it's easy enough to follow and not mess up. But that's about it.

Cons: Every other character outside of Chris Pine's, Gal Gadot's, Ares (to an extent), and maybe aunt amazon general honestly suck. They don't know whether to develop characters or leave them in the background and we're left with really weak supporting characters. What the heck was the point of scottish sniper man. To have ptsd? You can do that with literally any other soldier. Native American man? To send a smoke signal? What? I liked the sweet talker I guess. The villains are ridiculous. Ludendorf (i couldn't understand a lot of what he was saying tbh) and Dr. Poison or whatever were so over the top. I get it it's a comic book and I actually like over the top cheesy comic book villainy characters (see: Red Skull) but these guys suffered from the fact that they weren't the real villains and as such these guys ended up being so flat for me as characters. Speaking of main villain, Ares was weird to me. I liked the acting, the story, the dialogue, and I guess the twist (a bit obvious) but the culminating fight scene sucked due to the choice in implementation. This is frickin Ares, god of war, and all we got was some really bad CG and Remus Lupin.

On a side note, I still have mixed feelings about the weird glamour shots they give wonder woman during her fight scenes (like vs Doomsday in BvS or the No Mans Land scene). Is it because she paints a beautiful picture of war? Is it because she's hot? (She is, don't get me wrong) Is it just a Zack Snyder thing? I don't get it. Also what has she been doing since WW1, what was she jumping towards at the end...? 

Pretty much you can draw a lot of parallels between this movie and Captain America 1 and I think Captain America honestly does everything better. Overall not a bad movie, Gal Gadot and Chris Pine definitely pulled it through, but best super hero movie of 2017? Not really.",6erigc

A lot of common tropes, silly and obvious twists, inane plot points, unfulfilled character arcs...And to top it all off the silly ""i gotta die with the plane"" thing.   I was someone who actually liked ""BATMAN VS. SUPERMAN"" (Know i'm in the minority) but this was a major major step back for me.  

I will say the Amazonian fighting style was rather fresh, with all the horse work and backwards flips and such.   And i did like Robin Wright.  Diana's naivete was very frustrating, though. ",6erigc
did93o4,"So I've been trying to digest for the last 12 hours why I didn't feel blown away by the movie.  Now I thought it was good as far as Summer spectacle action goes, but the entire time I couldn't help but feel a lack of investment in the action going on and I think I've figured out why.

First, the inevitable comparison to MCU.  No, not because I thought it was similar to Captain America, because other than the setting (and the weird ""Steve sacrifices himself on a plane filled with WMDs"" coincidence) I didn't feel like they were really at all similar.   Instead, I just want to compare character development, because I think this was the weakest part of the story.

Why the hell is Diana a ""pacifist"" (we can obviously sort of debate whether she is or isn't)?  She was raised by warriors, she skipped school to go watch them train, she fought with her mother to learn how to fight at a young age, and there's nothing from her past that really shows how she developed so much sympathy, not just for mankind, but for seemingly everything and everyone.  You would think from her Godly ancestry and her years of training that killing the enemy would not be something that actually weighs on her soul, yet we are shown multiple times how it does, culminating in her essential forgiveness of the ultimate war criminal she encounters.

* Stever Rogers personality is borne from his weakness.  He builds immense character because he has to in order to compensate for his lack of size and strength.  He is then granted strength by a scientist. 

* Tony Stark is a rich brat who just so happens to be a genius, which is why he turns out to be such a flawed human often corrupted by hubris.  Even though he too is a pacifist in that he turns his fathers weapons research company into a renewable energy company, he still isn't even invited to be an Avenger initially due to his flaws.

* Thor is a great parallel to WW.  Both are essentially demigods.  Both from essentially unearthly, foreign domains.  Yet Thor's culture is not necessarily a warrior culture, yet we see the warrior tendency's with him.  He is quick to anger, loves to fight, and dives headfirst into it getting him in trouble.  This is the sort of arc we might expect out of Diana based on her origins, but we don't really get.

Now I guess I could accept that Diana's compassion is ultimately innate, but it would have been nice to see some of that at the beginning of the movie when she was a child or even on the beach scene when she was surrounded by death.  Instead, it never really manifests on screen in her backstory.

Secondly, Diana is too flawless.  She battles effortlessly.  She looks like a super model.  She has impeccable character.  Her only flaw is that she is new to the world and naive, which is something she overcomes in the climax.  While this is fun to write and I'm sure people will love it since they've never seen it delivered this well in female form on screen, it really removes all the gravity from the action on screen.  Diana is never so much as scratched during any encounter.  Sure she gets hit, but the hits are weightless since she recovers instantly (other than the one explosion that leaves her slightly concussed in the final battle).  There was never any doubts to the ultimate outcome of any encounter.  

Finally, the final battle.  Unlike a lot of people, I enjoyed the CGI fest, because a superhero action movie needs at least one over the top CGI action sequence and I felt like this at least delivered on that and didn't overstay its welcome.  However, it was really hard to determine the stakes in this fight because we knew essentially nothing about the powers of either person fighting.  Why do WW's bracers block literally everything?  She's clearly using them on purpose and not just walking through the bullets and debris, so what's their story?  What's with them sometimes emitting a giant concussive blast?  Why does this phenomenon never seem to phase Diana, like ""wait wtf did I just do?""  Why does she never endure a single scratch from being thrown to the pavement over and over? If it's so important to block bullets, that means she can be hurt by them, right?  Who knows?

Simultaneously, what are Ares powers?  He appears to be Magneto but super strong and immune to fire, and his weakness is lightning?  Except he can also conjur lightning bolts?  Why? Did he absorb Zeus's power?  Once again, who knows?

And then the fight just sorta ends because the script deems it needs to end.  Diana becomes empowered (by love?) and all of a sudden Ares is no match.   Why her bracers can conduct lightning and can then shoot it back out is still a mystery, but hey, the fight needed to end so something new had to happen right?  Once again, who knows?

Other than that it was a lot of fun, I just wished it had done more to develop the character.  I don't feel like I really know her that well after watching this which is what makes the MCU so damn good.   Great movie, but still eaves me with lots of concerns about DCEU.  I think the Metacritic score is pretty apt.  7.5/10

dicr6xd,"Who paid for the positive reviews on this one? Honestly. This was one of the dumbest movies. I say dumb, because as it kept going I felt like my own intelligence was being insulted on every front. 

The film started out immediately jarring on account of my not seeing Batman Vs. Superman and not understanding the significance of that whole intro. Forgivable, I didn't know it was a prerequisite. Then again DC kinda did a reverse marvel and began their universe with their Avengers and are only now branching off doing the individual movies. I don't count the Nolan Batman films because those clearly weren't made with the intention to be a part of these movies.

I enjoyed the establishment of the amazons and the war invading their home. 

I enjoyed Dianna's introduction to England and her interactions with everyone.

But then once it gets to the war it goes to shit.

They waltz right up to the front lines. There's an uncomfortably ill timed quip from WW when she does the dramatic turn and reveals her armor, like she thought of a witty reply in the shower hours later.
And what's supposed to be a brave moment for her is just complete cornball. There should have been HUNDREDS of soldiers firing on her. The entire line of German opposition baring down. The whole thing felt like the dollar store version of WW1. Where was the scale? It was called the Great War for fucks sake.

Then they quickly clear out a garrison in the town and suddenly everyone is happy and dancing, not concerned at all that the enemy on either end of the lines might, yknow, try to find out what just happened to an entire flank? They take a night to dance and sing and be romantic. Because they obviously have so much time to burn. No lets not infiltrate the gala before the event, let's show up right when it's too late.

They then fucking waltz up to a ""gala"" with the entirety of the German command. We never see the Kaiser, we get to this place, WW has a moment with the supposed baddy, and then she leaves when she realizes the village is in trouble. 

THEN with no former establishment in any way, they understand that a SIGNAL FIRE is the exact location where the bad guy has gone off to, which conveniently is a massive air field with for some reason no competent defense. Enough so that WW waltzes up, kills the top general or whoever that distraction was, blows up the roof of the building and kills him... with NO ONE BELOW NOTICING. There are search lights panning across the facility the entire rest of the scene. No one cared. What the fuck?!

Remember that old British guy we liked earlier? Turns out HE was the villain! Proof that... I don't know, we didn't know he was the God of war because the God of war wasn't established to be tricksy like some kind of snake in the garden of Eden? You didn't go ""oh, it was him!""

It could have been the fucking secretary. It was so insignificant WHO he was that it took away from the fight with WW. A fight which I also hated because in things like this with two equal powers, it ends up resorting to something like out of Gurren Lagann, in which the hero who is either outmatched or equally matched suddenly and unexplainably attains an advantage in power purely through their own monologue. It makes the previous ten minutes of explosions and bullshit so cheap and a waste when you do that.

So that was her origin story. Cool. She's in France for some reason. She heard... a siren outside? Better climb to the top of a French rooftop and fucking jump off into space. I guess she can fly now? What exactly are her powers? 

I believe there is opportunity in every film. I really don't see how with such large budgets and resources these guys can keep churning out this shit. Fucking have some form of story and storytelling ability to make something compelling. 

On the way out of the theater I talked with people about how the last few superhero films we've seen have all gotten high marks, and every time we leave feeling cheated. It makes so much more sense thinking of the meta critic scale like school grades. If you scored 75% on all of your assignments, no one will be, nor should they be praising your achievements. You've got a C, and you aren't doing your best. We payed to watch someone's C grade homework.

It was also choc full of characters knowing things just cause the script needs them to (I laughed out loud when he knew that smoke signal was where the general was somehow) and the team wondering into areas that should be heavily guarded Willy nilly with no one caring at all or trying to stop them.

There were really only 2 characters with any semblance of personality, and even then they still were pretty one-dimensional. I also didn't think Gal Gadot was anything special, and all her naive scenes in London felt forced.

Also, I don't understand Wonder woman's motivations here. It's established she wants to try and save humanity from its corruption and sees the good in everyone etc., yet then goes to the front line willingly and murders all these Germans. There's a scene at the end where she literally murders a dozen innocent soldiers, but then she doesn't kill one of the actually evil villains because suddenly she feels sympathy now... After murdering hundreds of other soliders, who were no different to the British or American troops? That's just fucking stupid. 

Besides, why were the Germans the corrupted ones anyway, and not the other side? It's not like in WW2 when there was one obviously bad side. Surely the script could have thought of a smarter way of having her try to stop Aries without killing lots of Germans and contradicting her main belief?

It also had to have the dumbest twists ever. There was literally no significant reason or meaning to having that random British guy be Aries. He had such a minor role in the film it had no impact at all and made the final battle unengaging cause we barely interacted with this guy. Also, Why the fuck is the god of war some random British dude? Seems a bit silly. Does he have some metamorphic ability? Or was he always the appearance of a middle aged, early 20th century British man. Certainly very convenient for the film if it's the latter, but it's a minor point overall.

It was just a bland superhero origin movie I've seen plenty of times before, with the standard story structure and big finale. It was a chore to sit through as there was nothing interesting about it. Felt like I was watching a movie made by board executives instead of a film with any sort of creativity

dig0nmn,"I will give it to Gal Godat, she pulled off Wonder Woman better than I thought she would. However the movie does have faults IMHO. 

1) It feels like the movie was set in WW1 simply because Captain America already did WW2. If I was German I might be slightly offended at being depicted as an army of mass murderers when both sides used chemical weapons. 

2) Outside of Chris Pine the rest of the supporting cast played little to no pourpose outside of Chief being Native Maerican so he could throw up some smoke signals... really smoke signals... the short Persian who talked his way into the ball, and the supposed bad ass sniper who I don't remember sniping anyone. 

3) It needed to cut 30 minutes of unnecessary conversations and attempts at light humor. 

4) Villians were entirely forgettable. The Aries plot line was stupid. Bless those ""freed"" German soldiers at the end acting as if all war like tendancies left mankind. I mean not like there were anymore wars ever right?",6erigc

dimce2d,"I liked it a lot, but the scripting was poor. The Amazonian scenes ran well, but once WW got to England, it was like all the actors were suddenly ad-libbing. There seemed to be no direction happening in that entire sequence, it felt very messy, almost like a first run-through. I felt the editing was patchy throughout. Characters would be talking to someone and the camera would linger on the person listening to them just a tad too long. There were times where I was thinking ""Cut! Now cut to the next shot already!"" which was a weird feeling.

Obviously the No Man's Land scene had its charm, but it would've been better to just drown out Steve for a minute and really let the decision be Diana's. Again, her putting on her headband was too long a shot with her back to the camera. It looked weird. The whole scene though was obviously the standout moment and the heart of the film/character.

Maybe it's part of his character but Steve's stuttering frustrated me. It kind of made sense when he was trying to explain war to Diana and was completely overwhelmed by the uselessness of it all. His stuttery speech really worked there. But otherwise - again the England scenes - it was just annoyingly played for comedy like ""Look at WW making all the men speechless!"". 

That said, they played her naivety really well and throughout the film her personality was well established. It was neat how she developed her belief system based on the constant choices she was forced to make. I'm very interested in a sequel where she has to comprehend that not everything is black and white. Similar IMO to how Cap America was most compelling in Winter Soldier, once he had been exposed to modern life/war for a while.

I think WW worked so well because she is very similar to Captain America, arguably the best superhero in all the modern films. I mean, this film is basically identical to Captain America save for a few key differences. But Cap 1 and 2 were always my favourites anyway so it's nice to have a female version. 

I just wish the second act had been a bit stronger and better written. Were there any reshoots? Also WAY too much slow-mo in the action scenes.

It sounds like I disliked it, I really didn't. I gave it a 7 in the poll. I thought the whole ""war isn't just one bad guy"" thing was a great thing for a 2017 film to examine.",6erigc
dicvx3o,"Easily the best DC movie we've had since the Dark Knight. I love how much hope Wonder Woman can inspire. This movie really did everything Man of Steel should have done, hopefully Snyder takes notes for Man of Steel 2! I just pray that the Wonder Woman we get from Justice League onwards isn't brooding or dark or whatever to fit the tone of the universe. We need more colour and happiness in DC movies to balance the darker themes and Wonder Woman did this excellently!


Although I have a few things to point out.


1. Wonder Woman suddenly retrieves her sword after killing the guy she thought was Aries the exact scene after they make a point about her sword being in the roof. We don't ever see her jump on the roof and recover the sword.


2. If Aries is dead then how do future wars occur? Did WW2 happen? etc.


3. Why isn't Gal Gadot my wife?


4.The final CGI fight dragged on a little too long for my liking and much like the other DCEU films looked like a cartoon.

My only nitpick is that I would rather have all the German characters actually speak German. Like, some of them didn't even have the typical English/German accent. We can deal with a few subtitles.

But outside of that, the movie was absolutely fantastic. The final battle could have been a little better, but I don't think it ultimately hurt the movie all that much.

His armor wasn't good and oh man the actor chosen for the role did not fit at all. Would have been fine if that was his disguise but god damn he even had that mustache under the helmet.

difnh5n,"I liked the movie and feel that the non-action parts carried the movie enough that it was generally a positive experience. Ignoring a handful of poorly written lines. [the whole faith in humanity speech has been done many times, and many times it has been done better](#spoiler).

I truly feel that DC does non-hero characters and relationships in general better, and that Marvel does action scenes better. Both companies are missing what the other seems to excel in. Both do humor well, when it's not being abused(latest Avengers is a prime example.)

Sadly the choreography prevented this from being outrageously good, especially in the final fight. Barring a few action scenes, [knee into church and the fight immediately preceding it](#spoiler) a lot of the action in the first and third act was underwhelming and even at some points frustratingly bad. Thankfully most of the story, dialogue, and characters more than made up for the inadequacies of the fight scenes.

My only remaining complaint, albeit relatively minor, is the whole ""war is bad"" was a bit hamfisted. Many of those scenes could've been shot with no dialog and had more effect, the old ""show, don't tell"" way of filmmaking.

I **really** loved how her naivety was shown upon being introduced to the rest of the world and her subsequent loss of faith over the course of the story, as was further evidenced in BvS.

It's a great movie for the market it was intended(18-25, male) and it's a good comic book movie, but sadly it's not much more than that. On the bright side; I don't think it intended to be a movie for the ages, it's just plain fun.

It's still a decent superhero movie and I would give it a 7/10 but with how highly praised everyone else seems to be about it, I must be out of the norm.  I hope this is much like Captain America where it gets better after you sludge through the 'origins' story in the first movie.",6erigc

I liked parts of it, but like what others are saying, some parts did drag out.  Overall, it was the best DCEU film yet, but that's not a hard feat to accomplish. On a side note, I do like the new DC intro.  
  
Gal Gadot really shines in the role, as does Pine in his.  I also really like that they didn't feel the need to cram the WW theme down our throats.  The very few times it played, it wasn't drawn out nor was it overpowering.  
  
I like that it was Diana remembering the past and not a film that was entirely set in the past where the film has to play catchup to bring it up to present day, a la Captain America: The First Avenger.

I hate that they would use subtitles in some parts, but refused to let Germans speak German where they would normally. Also, and this is my main gripe, I hate when prequel/origin movies show a character doing something more powerful or superior to what they do in later (timeline wise) movies. If she was able to do the stuff she did against Ares, why did she not against Darkside in BvS. It's possible I'm not remembering correctly, but she just seemed to be more in control of her powers by the end of this movie than she did 100 years later.

Gal Gadot is easy on the eyes and plays the role to perfection. Chris Pine kills it, and the supporting cast is strong as well.

Only complaint was we got seated in front of a row of obnoxious teenagers that talked and played with their phones for the entire movie.

Also, good to know Justice League is jumping right into Darkseid.  Who needs build up, let's just bust after 3 movies. What a train wreck. ",6erigc
dih2xgz,"Honestly I really don't get all the love for this movie. It was pretty generic and painfully full of cliches. They spend a large portion of time on a pointless romance sub plot that is not only boring, but is undercut by the fact the viewer knows Steve (I think that was his name anyway) dies either due to old age or gets killed somehow in the war. Personally, I found it hard to care about him or his eventual death since I knew from the beginning he was dead either way and would never be seen again. 

   Also the whole thing with Ares just felt weak.The actual fight itself was pretty meh with him being all powerful for about 5 minutes until Wonder Woman is able to instantly kill him with the power of love or some bullshit. Hell I would have preferred if Ares wasn't even in the movie just to reinforce the whole theme that humans do evil shit of their own volition and there isn't always some big bad orchestrating everything. Felt kinda dumb that they had a whole scene highlighting this message to just undermine by going ""oh hey Ares was actually influencing events all along"". Yeah they try and go with the whole he didn't really manipulate them directly angle, but his whole inclusion just honestly added nothing to me. And they never explained why the general was huffing gas that was supposed to ""restore his strength"". Like I get they wanted us to believe he really was Ares, but it feels like a cheap trick since there was no explanation for that. 

A more minor issue was how they spent a lot of time exploring the whole War is Hell theme which on paper I liked since it was supposed to shatter WW's naivety regarding war, but with the movie being PG-13 a lot of those scenes fell flat to me. The main one being the gassing of the village which could have been a very impactful scene but instead it was just ""oh they killed them all I'm mad now"". That scene really could have shown the horrors of chemical weapons, but was hamstrung by the need to keep it PG which I understand from a business point of view, but I think it kinda harmed the overall film. 

There are several other things about the movie that bothered me, but they more nitpicks than anything (All the Germans shooting at the bullet proof shield instead of the troops clearly flanking them comes to mind), so I won't talk about them, but my final complaint was the length of the movie. I was honestly super surprised to find out it was only around 2 hours and 20 minutes. It felt like a 3 hour movie and had lots of parts where it just kinda drug on and on. Like at least 30 minutes of the movie could have been cut out in my opinion.  

I will say it wasn't all bad some of the writing and dialogue was pretty nice and I really enjoyed the music. The fight scenes and CGI were flashy and pretty, but I will say they really overdid the slowmo. Overall the movie was nothing special to me. Did Suicide Squad and Batman VS Superman really set so low that an alright movie from DC gets so much praise? I guess I rambled on long enough for this wall of text that like 2 people will probably end up reading. ",6erigc

My favourite parts about the movie:

* They nailed WW's personality - very stubborn, warrior-like but also very compassionate
* After Snyder's movies, daytime scenes and lighter/humorous scene were a welcome change, while still keeping the overall tone serious
* Great visuals and fight scenes, I like how they utilized all parts of her arsenal incl. lasso
* Ending[When she gives up fighting because she loses hope in mankind, which is then redeemed by Steve's sacrifice](#spoiler)
* The part where WW just goes into No Man's Land to save the civilians 

The criticisms:

* Slow mo shots were a bit too long for my liking
* Some of the light scenes were a bit too long as well, like the clothes shopping scene
* Ending[The ares fight also dragged out for too long imo](#spoiler)
* I wish Ares changed his face to a more fitting one, the British face and moustache was a throw off. At least keep it in the helmet at all times or something
* WW vs Ares fight is disappointing. Man of Steel is how I imagine two overpowered being fight each other, not just stand there throwing projectiles

did3g9p,"This movie is excellent and exactly the movie it needed to be when it comes to women in action movies and feminist stories in general.

There was no ball-busting that eye-rollingly wants us to believe that strong women can only exist in the absence or emasculation of strong men. Strong men and women existed together, expressed a range of emotions, and respected each other. They showed Diana in her own element as a capable person befor making her a fish out of water, and even then, the humor came from pointing out the weirdness of OUR sexist world, not her oddities as Strong Female Character. 

The romance and implied sex was tasteful and didn't reduce either of the characters to stereotypes or fall back on dumb love tropes. Her love for Steve was organic and didn't make her any less of a wonder.

Funny, without being try hard. Serious, without feeling corny. Probably my only criticism was your typical unthreatening villain. David Thewlis was good, but all recent superhero seem to fall at the villain hurdle.

When Trevor shows up, I think the movie gets better. Adult Diana is amazing and Gal Gadot rocks. Her interactions are spectacular.

However, once Ares for real shows up, eh? I know it's surprising that Lupin is Ares, but then I can't take him seriously. And when he gets the armor... why couldn't they have put in the shadowy face and glowing red eyes? 

And the action scenes at they very end... they just seemed generic, I guess? Ares had lots of lightning and magnetism abilities, but that wasn't very impressive. And Diana gets random god powers because?

That was an incredible way to introduce THE Wonder Woman. That whole scene from the trench to the bell-tower I thought was really awesome. I don't think this film is perfect though. I didn't really appreciate the ending that much. I really liked that after she killed Ludendorff the war kept going. I actually would've preferred it if they didn't add Ares at the end. And basically said that war is an inescapable, never-ending story. That kind of ending I would've liked a lot more than her just killing Ares, and then immediately ending the war. But other than the ending I really liked this film. Definitely the best DCEU film so far (I'm just stating the obvious at this point).",6erigc

Ares doubles down on this and remarks how all he's down thus far is whisper to mankind while their actions have been their own. Really interesting juxtaposition of Diana's idealistic view of mankind and it's reality.

BUT GUESS WHAT? As soon as Ares is killed, the fighting stops, the war ends, and Chief and the German soldiers about to gun him and his friends down hug it out and laugh. What? 

In the end this movie wanted to have it both ways, it wanted to say that mankind has the ability to be truly despicable without being controlled by Ares, BUT ALSO that Ares is the only thing keeping mankind fighting. Messy storytelling imo...",6erigc
dimbgq4,"Greenscreen effects are too obvious in some shots especially in daylight scenes like little Diana jumping off the ledge. Some bad CG replacement is very obvious like cg Wonder Woman using her lasso taking out German soldiers or when her cg mother jumping of her horse on the beach battle. Their movement are too stiff and cartoonish with doll faces. When it is a practical effect, it looks great like when Antiope jumps up to shoots 3 arrows midair. That use of slow mo in that scene is more appropriate compared to the countless unnecessary ones that pop up when Wonder Woman was fighting in Veld village.

I think the writing is very tv like, with information and exact lines being used repeatedly. The line ""killing ares will end the war"" is repeated too many times. Starting from Diana saying this to her mother, then to Steve, then Steve says it to the Sammy. Even in the end, Diana repeats it again to Steve one more time before going off to kill Luddendolf. Watching the movie a second time, I cringed every time the line is spoken. I get it that this is a very important thing to emphasis, but a better writer would found a better way to make the same point. That being said, some dialogue are written way too long for the lead actress to handle with her accent. Hopefully, in the sequel, the writer and or director would take note of this.


Gal Gadot is chosen not for her natural acting ability, but for her screen presence and physicality. She know how to pose / vogue for those important action scenes, making the comic Wonder Woman character jump off the pages into the screen. Her face acting is okay / basic to get the point across but would not win any accolades. That being said, her body acting during emotional moments are very stiff. One example is after the mustard gas killed the villagers, the director cut to a mid shot, where we see Wonder Woman standing. We can see the sadness in the face, but she doesn't know what to do with her hands. Maybe clenched her fists or get her down the ground on her knees like Furiosa in Mad Max so to convey more of her anguish and anger.


That being said, if asking Gadot not continue be Wonder Woman, the same can be said that Scarlett Johannson should be replaced as Black Widow (especially in the solo movie, if one exist in the future). Although Scar Jo is a more experienced movie star, her portrayal is constantly lethargic and guarded. It is thru that Scar Jo was a better Black Widow in Avengers due to better writing and direction from Joss Whedon, but this has since gone downhill, and even end up written as a love interest in Age of Ultron cause they don't know what to with her in that movie. Upcoming Captain Marvel Bree Larson may have the credentials, but if the dialogue and direction is bad, she may have her work cut out like when she was in another blockbuster Kong - Skull Island.


The biggest issue with female superhero is her arc. Where she start, what changed her, what she learned along the way and where she ended up. It should be easy to follow, and not have unnecessary twist along the way that muddle the whole journey. This is something that is still frequently contrived and not written organically. Or perhaps this is something that should also be look at for other superheroes as well, male or female. As for an origin story goes, this is middle of the road, par for the course. The sequels is when her character can grow and the audience get to know her better.",6erigc

djm6ycf,"this was great, right up until the last ten-fifteen minutes, where it became a giant pile of garbage.  when did ares become palpatine?  why do movies insist on terrible looking cgi?  if ares is dead, why did world war two happen if world war one only happened because of him?  why rip off sauron and magneto so hardcore?  

this movie felt really fresh and new and sincere up until it turned into a storm of bullshit cliches.

also, why was the color correction so terrible?  there's like, no actual white in any of the scenes in this.  it almost felt like the person doing color ""correction"" was trying to imitate several old 60s-70s film stocks but doesn't realize how garbage digital grain looks compared to film grain.  and it felt like it couldn't find a look it liked and stick with it.

why was the depth of field so weird?  why does it look super super super sharp sometimes and not others?

why was it in wwi and not wwii?

this film was so close to being awesome that the end was kind of heartbreaking.

also, shouldn't that be a glass negative and not a glass positive?  was anyone shooting glass positives with view cameras in that era?  wouldn't that be super impractical to display because of the fragility when you could just contact print from a glass negative?",6erigc

dikad4m,"Just got out of a showing, was not impressed at all. Post Nolan is ""ok"" for a DC super hero film but I will never actually buy this on physical disk or digital.

By the third or fourth time they did the slow motion, green screen, wind in her hair Pantene Pro V money shot of Gal Gadots face I was just over it.

Some of the CGI was atrocious as well, when they are in the village and shes lassoing the German soldiers she looked like a cartoon, like Neo fighting 100 Smiths bad. The fight between her and Ares was kinda boring too to be honest. At least with Doomsday she was actually getting in there, getting some hits in. Ares was just 20 minutes of her getting her ass beat then she carebear laser beams him down with love from her chest or whatever. 

So many wtf moments. When she goes back to the village I couldn't see shit, she just looked at something that looked like maybe it was a person on the ground and then .... nothing. When Chris pine infiltrates the castle no one thinks its odd that a German general would speak in english, then again all the Germans spoke in english so .... i don't know.

I also don't see why they needed an ensemble, none of Chris Pines friends did squat. The middle eastern guy brought them drinks and badly pretended to be an indian. The native american made smoke signals and stole a car. Spud from Trainspotting whos supposed to be this awesome sniper didn't actually snipe anyone that I saw. I also didn't care about any of them.

The entire movie just felt so disjointed to me. It started off fucking strong, the entire first act showing her growing up and training had me. That was the best part of the movie by far imo. But once they get off the island it just kind of goes to shit.

They set sail, take a nap, wake up in London, 15 minutes of comedy as they try to dress her up, then action sequence in the alley, she reads the chemists notes, misogynistic old fat white general storms out in a huff, they go to a bar, meet two people that will do nothing the rest of the film, go and meet a native american that will also do nothing, fight trench warfare for 10 minutes, liberate some town, have a moment of tenderness, infiltrate a German castle using English and a bad German accent, go back to the gassed village and lose faith, watch a single scene of her on horseback in the woods fighting soldiers then we are suddenly in a German military base, big baddy fakeout number one, Pine finds the super plane thing, real big baddy and WW throw down, Pine eats it, WW shoots her carebear beam, melts Ares, the end.

Definitely better than Suicide Squad, no where near as good as Nolans Batmans and probably a little worse than Man of Steel.

dil8ln8,"I didn't like Wonder Woman. It's my opinion, so in defense of possible harassment because of disagreements and the touchy subject of women in entertainment -- this is my own personal opinion. 

I didn't like how they didn't explain the rules of the world she's in. What is exactly her power and how she got them -- not the god aspect, but something plausible. I was fine with Superman because of the lore of the Yellow Sun. Yes, he's God to us, but there's a grounded lore explanation to this. 

She's the daughter of Zeus? Gods fought? There's the God of War? All of this put me off immensely. It's such a disconnect from the world of Batman and other superheroes that have a good explanation for their powers. 

It would even be better if they didn't explain any of it. Just give us hints as to what is going on (like the Joker in the trilogy). So this exposition is what killed the movie for me. 

The chemistry was good between the main characters. The soundtrack is kickass. But the lore exposition combined with the stupid ending are just off-putting. 

Yes, this is hands down the best DC Universe movie. But it stacks below the first two Thor movies for me in terms of superhero movies. Dumb and not self aware. 

Flame me all you want",6erigc
dixv6x7,"Ok, so first of all I LOVE that the movie was made and that it has been and will be an inspiration to girls of all ages to be a hero and all of that.
The move was good, certainly the best film that DC has put out since Batman: The Dark Knight. However, it was not great. It was held back from greatness for a few reasons.

1) The Lighting - I know that the director wanted to showcase the difference between Themyscira and the Real World and used lighting to do that. But that didn't stop the movie from using the same drab palette for 2/3 of the move as the Superman and Batman films. When is DC going to realize that drab does not equal ""gritty"".

2) Unnecessary Characters - Chris Pine, Gal Gadot and Lucy Davis were all wonderful and I loved seeing them together on screen. The entire rest of the cast could have not been there and the story would have gone on without them. The sniper that couldn't' shoot, the token American Indian, and the guy with the fez were all superfluous to the plot and felt like they were only there to sell more action figures.

3) Underused Villains - Mostly Dr. Poison, but to some extent all of the villains were just evil for the sake of evil. Dr. Poison had so much promise. We could have learned why she did what she did, empathized with her a little bit. But no, she was just evil, cackling laugh and all. And in the end, her plot was left completely open. I'm sure that they will say that they did that for the sequel, but it left me feeling there was a loose end.

4) Surprise! New Power - AFAIK Wonder Woman has Super Strength, Agility, Endurance and Flight. Her bracers let her deflect bullets. All cool and well done for most of the movie. When has she ever been able to absorb and redirect energy? The entire climax was resolved by this newfound power. Maybe it's tied to her being a ""god"". Maybe she can only use it because Zeus gave her that ability to be the ""
god-killer"" and it only works against Ares. We don't know, it was not explained. But I don't like the trope of giving a hero a new power to finish off the boss. It feels like lazy writing.

5) CGI Slugfest - Most of the movie's battle scenes were the stuff little kid's dreams are made of. Epic in scope and grounded in the scene. But not the finale. DC has this habit of doing a giant CGI mess for their finale. It takes us out of the scene and leaves you disconnected. I really don't like that choice, and I hated that what could have been an epic fight devolved into CGI explosions.

If you read all of this, dear Lord what's wrong with you? :P But I want to finish by saying that this wasn't a bad film. I'd give it a 6/10. But it is not worth the hype that surrounds it IMO. So, go and enjoy it, but to say that this is going to bring DC up to the level of Marvel is just people deluding themselves. It's a step in the right direction, but they have a long way to go.",6erigc

dig6bfr,"Saw wonder woman last night. Definitely not worth the hype. I am unclear why everyone likes it so much. It wasn’t bad, but it did have many glaring deficiencies.

 * The CGI on Thermyscrae was pretty bad. One panning shot showed all the waterfalls and it looked circa 1995 CGI water effects.

 * Lots of action shots where Wonder Woman is fast. Then she can  move at super speed with no sign of inertia. Then at the end, she is literally just floating through a sea of bad guys as they get hit, anime style. 

 * Ares needs a full beard and head of hair if he is going to  be buff. An old man head on a buff body just looks ridiculous. 

 * The accents are terrible. Everyone on Thermyscrae just keeps changing and the native american guy sometimes has a terrible attempt at one. Was it all a cover up to make Gal’s english seem more tolerable/explainable?

 * Her mother, for some reason, is against training her in fighting even though it is revealed she is destined to fight Ares. This is totally nonsensical. They could have just made the mother a thinker as opposed to a pacifist/protecitonist. Would have been nice tie in to remember something she said at the end and tying it in with Trevor's watch.

 * The love plot and WW's naivete. I assume this movie is supposed to be empowering for women, yet the running joke throughout the movie is how naive she is about relationships, and of course, she falls in love with the first man she meets and his death/advice is how she realizes what to do. Oh, and she can’t get to the front without him, and constantly needs stuff explained to her. Its really dumb to be all about “woman power” when she basically requires a man to do anything useful or accomplish her mission. I know this makes me sound like I am some sort of super feminist, but I would actually like a female superhero and not arm candy that is also a super hero.

 * The ability of them to just drive to the front and walk into German High Command is about the level of realism I would expect from a movie/TV show from the early 90s

Overall I give it a solid 5/10. If they improved the CGI and fight scenes, and tweaked the plot so that Trevor and his team was trying their best to make sure she doesn’t cause an incident, and covering for her while she is gathering info and making her way to the front, it would be a lot better movie",6erigc

didkxuk," Ever since Batman V. Superman, The DC Extended Universe has been a pain in my ass. In 2016, the studio produced two cinematic pieces of garbage that both ended up on my Worst of List. Batman V. Superman and Suicide Squad. Both films made both exhausted and furious. In all honesty, it made dread watching the upcoming films in their lineup especially Wonder Woman. After watching this,  let me be the first to tell you that this movie is the testament of the term, “It takes a woman to do a man’s job.”



Wonder Woman may be a DC character, but has the personality of a Disney princess. This lady has the strength and mind of Mulan but the heart and kindness of Rapunzel. When she leaves her home, she starts learning everything about the world like a newborn baby. For a woman who was born on Earth, the most powerful moments of the film is how much Diana learns about it for the first time in ways far more effective than Kal-El in Man of Steel. She has a childlike innocence of the world that's beyond Themyscira. Because of her innocence, you become attached to her as an actual character with dimensions opposed to everyone else the DCEU introduced. She speaks her mind at a time women weren’t respected enough to be heard and those moments when she does are very powerful. As the film progresses you see Diana grow in both character and strength. She begins to understand her abilities more and becomes rightfully fascinated with them.

Wonder Woman is the first DC movie where you see both a three-dimensional lead and a lead who becomes the definition of a superhero. What Patty Jenkins excels at in this film is depicting who Diana is as she slowly progresses to becoming Wonder Woman. This movie is about a woman finding her worth as she learns about the world bigger than her. When you think about it, all of these traits sound similar to what Superman is but this film is everything Man of Steel should’ve been.

One of the other things that make this stand out more than the previous DCEU installments is that THERE IS COLOR. The movie isn’t always dark and gritty for the cinematography is bright and shiny. Somewhere through the film, caught myself saying, “Holy Shit, this movie is colorful, A DC MOVIE IS COLORFUL?! Thank you, Wonder Woman.”

Even my mom who I had to work hard to convince to come (doesn't see the sense in spending 11 bucks for a movie) loved it and was practically speechless by the time the credits rolled.",6erigc
diciq6q,Well worth the praise. Loved that Wonder Woman was flawed with ignorance and didn't give her the god analogy like Superman. Chris Pine did well.

dicmdkp,"Really really enjoyed the character work on this one, which was what the previous DCEU movies really lacked. I cared more about Diana's crew than I did Rogue One's entire cast, though I guess that's not saying too much.


Diana was consistently portrayed as innocent, a little naive, fiercely passionate, compassionate, and her love for life and her goodness is repeatedly emphasised in a setting that is still dark and pretty grim. It really completely destroys the ""You just think BvS is bad because it is dark and realistic, I am too mature for Marvel's light-hearted slapstick shtick!"" argument from BvS fanboys. Looks like you *can*, afterall, make a superhero feel like a inspirational upstanding figure even when she's put in a world with so much darkness in it. I hope Superman gets a similar treatment soon.

Between the action scenes the characters are allowed to breathe and her interactions with Steve were so good. The boat scene was great, their conversation about humanity's goodness was so good, it gave me chills. 

And of course the music is fucking amazing. Marvel has never managed to step up in the music department in any film other than Avengers 1, and so this is really good to have.

Villains were really weak, but eh.

Still thoroughly enjoyed this film, I hope Justice League turns out as good.",6erigc

1) Steve's accomplishments and his death. Actually killing Steve was very surprising to me, but the way they did it was very touching and realistic. I loved it.

2) The presence of Ares. I was thinking that the inclusion of Ares would be something cheap - something that would take away from the movie, i.e. having Ares as an 'idea' of man's corruption would be better than it being in anthropomorphic form. The British general(?) being Ares wasn't too interesting and I didn't notice any hints leading up to that, but they had to make it someone the audience was familiar with so it was okay. It was done well, Ares being an actual being.

Overall, good movie, I loved the fact that was no cameos - nothing to take away from Diana's contributions and presence in the movie. That was awesome.",6erigc

Action was good and the performances were on point. The movie took that step up to an awesome level as soon as she got up into No Man's Land and that theme kicked in.  
 
I did feel it dragged in some places though. It's a 140 minute movie but barely any time is spent with the villains, you find out very little about them. The film is all about Diana though and they give you a great backstory for her so all good I guess.  

For all the times I lament how predictable film and TV shows can be, I must admit I was surprised with the Ares reveal. I did note it stood out that Thewlis' character was far more open to working with a woman than anyone else was but I didn't suspect he would be Ares at all. My only prior exposure to the character was Injustice so you know I wasn't expecting a polite English politician to be the God of War.

I got a bit confused with the portal to Themyscira bit. Like is there any reason why there's this random gateway to the place in the middle of the ocean? Did I miss a line of dialogue explaining it?

diedd8t,"Just got back, solid 7/10 film. I think it served well as what it was trying to be, for better or worse, a war film. I felt like I would have really enjoyed more Wonder Woman stuff. I feel like Themyscera and the rest of the Amazons were really glossed over. Antipole's ""death"" in the beginning doesn't really serve anything. Did she even die? She seemed to be a cool character, if her only purpose was to be the dead mentor then that is a disappointment. 

The dialog was a little iffy at times, I think that much is pretty clear. My honest opinion is that Patty Jenkins elevated a shoddy script into a pretty fun movie, but the movie still could have been better. I think if this team could work with different writers for the next film we could really get a Winter Soldier level thing going here. Gal killed it, and really embodies the character well.

There's something I've been mulling over and I'd like to hear other people's thoughts. [What exactly was Ares motivation in all of this? I get that he mistrusts mankind and thinks it would destroy itself if given the chance, but he's the one that supplies them with all of the know-how to do it. He's an enabler who provokes people into doing what he claims they would naturally do on their own, then blames them for giving in. It just strikes me as a self-fulfilling prophecy. ""These dudes are self-destructive and suicidal, let me give them guns and see if they blow their own brains out!"" This is further confusing by the fact that he disguised himself as one of the people  negotiating an armistice. He supplies them with the knowledge of how to make bombs and chemical weapons but then tries to broker peace. What exactly is he trying to achieve by playing both sides? It seems to me that Ares desperately keeps probing mankind to see if they can prove him wrong, despite him having already made up his mind. It also reeks of hypocrisy since he waged war on and killed all of the other gods. But I guess when you're the god of war, you're a hammer that thinks everything looks like a nail.](#spoiler)",6erigc

The beginning on the island was fine but then once we got to the cave, the film only seemed to have blue-grey tints. (London and No Man's Land especially). And so many night-time scenes. The only stand-out color was the lasso and the explosions of the climax.

diivi8d,"Whole post is spoilers particularly about the ending section.

I thought the Ares twist was great, but that whole thing was underdeveloped really in the end. People saying that Ares either being non existent or irrelevant entirely being a better conclusion have a point, but I totally think they could have done something neater along the lines of what's already there, than what they did.

I was waiting for there to be some big point about Zeus actually being a dickhead (which tbh better fits with Greek myth anyway), the rest of the gods dying not because of Ares just killing them for lols but because of some big civil war or something, perhaps because Zeus was trying to mess with his children and have a 'new favourite' in humanity or something who he intended to be as deranged and dickish as him, and so the gods took sides. This still has Ares being 'bad' but in a more sympathetic way, doing it because he genuinely thought the destruction being created by humanity was not worth them being allowed to survive, because of his own grief at what was lost in the world and his family, because of what humanity and his father did to the 'old order', and because all the suffering he saw meant humanity was better off put down through the purity of war than being allowed to suffer through the malaise of their fragile existence.

The scenes in the tower came very close, but what they really needed to do was give Diana a real kind of 'crisis of faith', drawing her to questioning everything she had been taught by her mother (who, let's remember, never told her about her father, her purpose, or about the real state of the world) and whether all the human misery she had seen was worth humanity's continued existence. BUT, instead of siding with her Amazonian teaching that paints humanity as essentially pure, or with Ares' desire to start with a clean slate because the corruption is too great, she choses the third way - what's done is done, you cannot change the past, but there is something new worth salvaging that neither Ares nor Zeus expected, symbolised by Steve, by the villagers and all those people she sees throughout the movie. This is vaguely implied in some respects, but quashed in others. This should have been the ideological/philosophical heart of the film, but kinda gets smothered in all the CGI fighting at the end.

Instead what happens is she kind of just dismisses Ares with a ""I could never be a part of that"" in a way that just seems a bit limp, then Ares goes from being mildly sympathetic to just super evil, complete with demon costume, spouting the usual megalomania that villains do. 

I don't know, I think if they'd just developed that a tiny bit more it would have elevated the whole third act from being mediocre to a fantastic conclusion to everything that came before. 

Trading even 20 minutes of some of the more lacklustre sequences to developing the characters and ideologies of Zeus, Ares and Diana could have achieved that, and there's no doubt in my mind that both Gal Gadot and David Thewlis have the chops to pull nuanced character play like that off. David in particular was underutilised. He had a brief moment of real mystique in the tower, and could have totally played a sympathetic Ares, but instead had to ham it up to the max wearing a moustache in a demon costume.",6erigc

dik6y6s,"Got a question that ties in with Diana's appearance in BvS.

In BvS, she mentions that she's been gone for a hundred years, meaning that right after this WW1 movie (which I just now realized means both Wonder Woman 1 and World War 1), she leaves 'Man's World' again, and doesn't come back until modern day.

Is there any further insight on this or no?",6erigc

dil6yoa,"So, I agree with some of the criticisms I have seen put forth, but I loved the movie and it will be the first in a long time I'm going to buy on DVD. 

That said...Anyone else think it was super strange to cast David Thewlis and then not have him shave his silly mustache/wear a beard, like at least for his flashback scenes?

diwvr9w,"Easily the best of the DC-universe films. Yes, they had to have a showdown and some people might not have liked how the villain looked, but most of the movie was damn fine. The next standalone WW movie could be more creative in that department. Something as good as the second Captain America movie would be great. Maybe not even set in present day.  

I actually was hoping for a fight of WW against a bunch of super-drugged up soldiers.  

In the next movie they should explain how her powers get stronger or something the more she uses them in our world.

dj8d489,"A few thoughts:

Native American dude was a boss.  I'd totally watch a buddy comedy centered around him, the Scottish guy, and the (Turkish?) guy.

Watching a British PM shooting lightning out of his hands was ridiculous, particularly because I couldn't stop picturing Theresa May in David Thewlis's place.

The scene in the French village was very nice.

A sequel that just involved WW cleaning up the streets of 1920s Paris could be pretty cool.  But only if it's filmed entirely in French.

This movie did not live up to the hype.",6erigc

digtmn1,"The characters are all heavily one dimensional. Diana, for example has only one emotion, wonder, literally. Everything confuses her. The story that unfolds is so dry and cliche that more story could be found in a simpsons episode.

The fight scenes were well executed, yet unmemorable. And the overall experience made one feel nothing.

About as good as low level MCU movies like Thor 2 and Iron Man 3.

5/10",6erigc
dickp79,"I'm a little surprised with the critical reception that this movie is receiving. I wonder if it's just the novelty of a first female led superhero movie. To me it's a distinctly average movie. It's better than suicide squad and BvS for sure but imo Man of Steel is better. I thought the dialogue was a bit weird in parts. What does 'It's not about what you deserve, it's about what you believe' mean? And then when she said she believes in love it was a bit out of nowhere. I feel like the movie was trying for something profound without having earned it. The action was also poorly cut and the CGI was not up to standard for superhero movies.

The similar scene from MoS where Clark takes flight for the first time is miles better compared to where Diana steps out of the trench. I like her as wonder woman but that's about it. Captain America first avenger is just a straight up better version of this movie.",6erigc
die6ko5,"I didn't like it. At all.

The story was eerily similar to Captain America. Young hero who wants to fight and save the world, but told they can't. They get the opportunity to. Then, uh oh, man in charge says they can't. Its too dangerous! They form a motley crew of warriors to go stop Big Bad. Big Bad is some steroid monster who wants to end the world. They have to stop a plane. They do, but the hero goes down with the plane.
 
I understand that this is a broad generalization. Where WW strays from these lines, I did like. The LOST island stuff at the beginning was cool. The Amazonian backstory was cool.
 
I liked the misdirection of who Big Bad was, but it was so horribly done. They hinted at it for most of the movie, then made Lupin Big Bad. The character had no build-up; it was like they felt they _had_ to pick someone to be Big Bad, so they chose the only other character in the backlog, who up to this point had received a total of 90 seconds of screentime. Why are all the DC bad guys so unbelievably boring? GotGv2 actually got Big Bad right and made us care about his motivations, and then DC comes in and proves to us again that they're beyond incompetent.
 
And then to end it with such an eye-rolling ""love conquers all"" message. Her man dies and that unlocks her inner strength to defeat Ares. She had shown practically no affection toward Kirk for the entire movie, except their small dancing and PG-13 rated token sex scene. Is this supposed to send the message ""you need a man in your life who you practically ignore, he has to die, and then Woman is strong enough to defeat Big Bad""? Of course the first serious female superhero can only succeed because of love.
 
Big Bad is dead? Yay, we're all friends now! Let's hug and make up. If you're reading this and haven't seen the movie, I am not kidding. There's a nice sunrise scene with Gal in the middle of a bunch of German soldiers literally hugging the British commando group. I can't make this up.
 
Every single character except Gal and Kirk was facelessly expendable, including Big Bad. The music was forgettable. There were a couple well-shot scenes (the shot from above while taking fire crossing no mans land was especially pretty) but most of the movie was way too DC-gritty. If we ignore her whip the entire movie could have been black and white and I doubt anyone would have noticed.
 
I wanted more LOST island. I wanted more ""Zeus vs Ares"" backstory to build up Big Bad; fuck the misdirection, give us a Big Bad we respect and want to see defeated. I wanted more of Gal being independent and a Strong Female Lead, not constantly leaning on Kirk for moral and comedic support. I don't want a DC-style VFX puke-fest. I don't want Female Captain America.
 
The worst part is, I have to agree that this is the best Justice League universe movie they've produced. That's not a high bar to beat.",6erigc
die7icv,"I'm probably one of the few people who was disappointed by the film and doesn't get the huge RT score for it.

Positives: Gal Gadot and Chris Pine were excellent and they had amazing chemistry. The tower fight scene was pretty cool, and the ending where she takes out a bunch of Germans was really great.

Negatives: Even with a new director, it's still shot like a Zac Snyder movie, and it makes the movie incredibly ugly to watch sometimes. The CGI was really bad at times. The villain was predictable and his stupid fight scene made the final fight kind of hilarious. The dialogue can be painful at times (""All you need is love"" I mean really). 

I understand this is by far the best DC movie in the new universe because it seems competently made for the most part and isn't a complete shitshow, but being pleasantly surprised by mediocrity when expecting something terrible doesn't mean it's a great movie.

I don't begrudge anyone for liking it, and I think it's great people like it, but I just don't get a 94% RT score. That's more mindblowing to me than Jurassic World getting any positive reviews",6erigc
didgg7z,"So this movie ALSO ends with a self-sacrifice in an airplane by an actor named Chris, playing a character named Steve. 0/10. Marvel did that first!

diep3lx,"I loved the movie, but just wanted to highlight two things:

1. Gal was awesome and did everything right to walk the tight rope of a great female protagonist. She was feminine, tough, brave, vulnerable, and heroic. She wasn't just an attractive woman fighting/thinking like a dude like many female heroines are played.

2. Just impressive was Chris Pine, who had an equally tough role as the first ""romantic interest lead"" male in modern super hero film history. The role could have easily gone off the rails in so many directions, from man-hating to overly a jerk to some weird new age feminist guy thing. Instead he played it perfectly as a genuinely great guy who wants to do the right thing and would have been a hero in his own right if he had never met Diana, but at the same time (even outside his hard skills as a solider) is also respectful and patient with her so you can see why a naive Amazon demi-god warrior would fall in love with him. 

So kudos to both actors (as well as the writers and director) for nailing those lead roles so well. ",6erigc
diff36v,"My two cents.

Pros:  

* Gal is fantastic as Diana. She really is charming and embodies the role fantastically. I would go as far as to say she's the most suited for the role she was cast in so far (with what we've seen of Cavill, Affleck, and Miller).  

* Chris Pine was also fantastic. The scene on the boat between the two of them is exactly what we needed in the DCEU and I'm glad Warner Brothers finally realized we want to see these characters just interact in a humanly way.   

*  The direction for the scenes of characters just interacting was really great. I hope the studio gives Patty more free reign with the sequel, because I did feel like there were moments interjected into the movie that were the studios doing and not hers.   

Now for the cons:  

* The editing was atrocious. Good golly. Remember when Diana and Steve get the beer and are sitting and talking? She picks it up with her right hand, in the continuous wide shot it's then in her left hand. Then it's back in her right hand. It goes wide and she sets down her beer by her left side. Then it goes back in for the close-up and she's setting it down yet again. First of all, why even have the beer be introduced to the scene if they're not going to interact with it beyond that? And secondly, why would you go in and add the sounds for the beer being put down in post if it doesn't really make sense or add anything to the scene? I would've loved to see Diana interact with and talk about alcohol consumption, especially in the context of war, where the Scottish guy was always drinking to drown his sorrows. There were a bunch of problems like this throughout the movie and it really irked me.  

* That brings me to my next issue: the writing. While it was miles ahead of what they've done in the past, it's still a little spotty. The writing is so very exposition heavy in ways where it could've been avoided. It's a war movie: get creative! The movie was already so stylized, why not use more maps to explain what they need to do instead of having the characters talk for five minutes at a time?  

* Speaking of stylization, there was wayyyyyyyyy too much slow motion and shitty green screen. Way too much of it. The shot of Robin Wright shooting the three arrows in slow-mo would've been so much more effective if the preceding 10 minutes of the movie hadn't had slow-mo for all of that too. We get it, bullets in slow motion will get deflected or hit an Amazonian warrior. Don't bog down the rhythm of the fight scene with that. And the lasso and that entire fight in the third act looked really terrible at times. I really wish they would use practical sets in these movies when they can instead of resorting to green screening everything. It cheapens otherwise awesome shots.
 
* And, again, there are moments of writing that just don't make sense. When Wonder Woman was recalling what Steve said to her when she was leaving? There's no way she would recall that if she never heard it the first time around. Instead, have Steve think back to it, think back to saying ""I love you"" when he's in his final moments. Instead of having us experience it on her end when she never did in the first place, we should experience it from his end; it would've made his death scene even more powerful.  

* Lastly, the Ares twist isn't a twist if it's not built up to. The twist with Ego giving Star Lord's mom cancer worked because it was developed enough. In Wonder Woman, I had a feeling Thewlis was going to be the main bad guy because he had only had five minutes of screen time up until that point and there was no way they would waste him, but I really just rolled my eyes when he revealed himself. You can do better than that, DC, I know you can.  


Overall, it was a really great movie though. I'm just nit-picking from a filmmaking standpoint. But as entertainment, it was miles ahead of everything they've put out thus far. Kudos!",6erigc
dih57rm,"I don't think I can do much by dropping even more praise for this film here, so I'll field something else.

How does everyone feel about WW v. Ares? It felt very weak compared to the rest of the movie. Right when Trevor blows the plane, it feels like they switched to a live-action Dragonball Z sequence. 

You had:

* Really sudden, janky shift in the pace of editing 
* This weird, surreal order of events where you don't know who's where. Ares is suddenly really far away from Wonder Woman?
* A sequence where WW appears to be *skating* through endless amounts of Germans for what seems to be an uncomfortably long period of time. 
* Dialogue becomes really wooden suddenly - not even David Thewlis can save ""then I WILL DESTROY YOUUU""

Don't get me wrong - the rest of the movie was great. But this particular sequence reminded me of Suicide Squad's spastic feel an uncomfortable amount. ",6erigc
dik0r01,[deleted],6erigc
diml5om,"I loved the first hour. Having her grow up living this fantasy that her mother and other Amazons told her about the world and soon learning that she is something different.

The first hour was so well done and it introduced characters so well and gave them each enough developed time to care about.

Then the second hour hits. It's not bad, but it feels like everything suddenly became rushed to get to the next action sequence as soon as possible and the reasoning for why they had to fight, to me, wasn't good enough.

WW rushed to the frontlines to fight bad guys and stop Ares. Instead she stops to save a small village because she felt bad for every person she saw. I wanted some kind of consequence to happen but nothing came of that. She came off looking badass and Chris Pines character looking foolish for trying to rush to the Gasses.

I did want some kind consequence to happen soon after saving the village, just to show that she wasn't seeing the big picture that Chris Pine was seeing. You don't stop a war one battle at a time, you stop it as soon as possible or more people die. Thankfully something did happen because she stalled so much and her achievements were all for naught.

Actually she lost more than she gained, and that finally gave her character some humility.

Another issue with the film is that it doesn't actually reveal what her powers are or how they work. We're only told that ""she's different"". Yeah, we've heard that all before but no explanation why they're different(Man of Steel, GotG, Deadpool, Assassins Creed, etc). Then we're given a showcase of her abilities that she never demonstrated earlier in the film. I don't think she really reveled it to her friends either for why she is so strong and fast.

The ending left a sour taste. The addition of Ares and another MoS esque battle which wasn't really needed. Ares spent 5,000-odd years being cunning and deceptive and here he goes at the end of the film being brutish and loud.

Very strong start, very charming, the actors are mostly awesome. The sets are very well done, especially how they handled the portrayal of Themscyira. The end was very weak, the CGI looked too cartoonish and quick in a lot of cases. The story-telling wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst. Many points by characters really helped to shape Dianas perception of humanity.

Examples; Chief talking about joining no sides because he's lost too much already. Diana see's that as dishonorable, but Chief asserted that there is no honor to be had for his kind in another persons war, but there is money, and money can help his people more than white people can.

In the case of Charlie and Samir in the pub, Diana looks at them and comments that there are no soldiers there, no fighters, how can they help. She judged them by their demeanor before their character.

Charlie has ptsd and battles that everyday. Samir is faced with profiling because he's the wrong colour. Chief fends for himself because no one else will.

Regardless of their backgrounds, they're all good people. Not soldiers or fighters, but good people wanting to help. Their interactions with Diana changed her character quite a lot in the movies storyline and I really enjoyed them.

This is how it should have been done for Captain America but nope, they just wanted one more pointless montage.

Wonder Woman was very good, which is saying a lot considering how bad the tied-together films have been. I'm glad I watched it with low expectations.",6erigc
digmyjb,"I have no idea how this is getting such good reviews.

It's Captain America with a DC spin.  A hero fighting for freedom gathering a team of specialists and storming a ~~Nazi~~ German stronghold.

Not to mention Germans weren't evil in WWI.  Its an overused trope that really doesn't belong in this setting.  WWI was a war of alliances and collapsing empires entering the new modern era.

The whole movie felt like overused tropes.  You knew WW and that guy were going to hook up soon as he landed on the beach, you knew exactly who the bad guys were aside from maybe one, you knew exactly who the allied characters were just from looking at them and hearing their accents (really, that native American character has been around since the 40s), just *everything was overused tropes*.

difklpk,"Okay, so I just got back from the movie, and I was talking to the friend I went with about how I felt about it. I liked some stuff about the movie, and I also have some problems with it, so let's start with the positive:

- Gal Gadot is very, very good. I believed she was wonder woman the whole time. 

- Visually, the movie looks pretty damn incredible. The colors they chose accentuate the orange, and that's not something I've seen in a movie since Doctor Strange. More of this please. 

- The fight with the General was very well done and felt like it had some weight. 

- Charging No Man's Land with the machine gun fire was actually pretty stellar. That's the best part of it. 

- I genuinely laughed more times in this DC movie than I have in any other. Lots of witty dialog. 

- I did not see the twist coming. Props!

So there are some things I like! Now, for the not so great portions. 

- The setting is weak and forced. I don't feel a sense of urgency about this war, even if it is WW1. Really, setting things at the END of the war is the problem. How about setting it in 1917 when the US first joins? Much more dire.

- A lot of the characters feel very 1 dimensional. 

- Some of the jokes really fell flat. So much so that one innuendo in my theater was so bad that we were left with an awkward silence, and I went ""oh, we were supposed to laugh...""

- The queen of the Amazon's reason for WW not to train is stupid. It's very, very, VERY stupid, not to mention that she basically immediately goes back on that. 

- ""Love is the answer"" is also stupid. This brings up the inherent flaw of DC, where altruistic characters with 0 flaws have to discover what makes us human. This leads to a weak resolution. 

- The action was for the most part mediocre. I've seen it all before, and nothing made me go ""wow, that must've hurt"". Could've been the cg, hard to say.

It was a simply fantastic film from start to finish and I can't wait to see it again. It had a few negatives but for me they were so minimal that they aren't even worth noting.

I think my favorite thing about the movie, besides the No Man's Land scene, was how Ares got his armor. It was a neat thing for him to build everything from the battlefield. 

It would have been super cheesey if all of a sudden he appeared out of nowhere in his armor so it was just a bit rad to see the God of War assemble his suit from the carnage of the war around him.

Even the soldiers had shell shock. And it wasn't black and white, good guy versus bad guy. [You had Trevor held up as this hero but Diana learned that ""his people"" stole everything from Chief's people making Steve's people's history muddy. Even Ares wasn't put evil. He wasn't going around killing people left and right but simply played the devil on people's shoulders. Whispering ideas in their ears and letting them do their own evil. It was as if Jenkins and Heinberg looked at Captain America: First Avenger and thought, ""That was too white hat and black hat. And it made war look cool. We need to fix this.""

difn6ah,"I liked this film quite a bit. I didn't love it, though. I will preface this by saying that I love Man of Steel and Batman v Superman and I think Suicide Squad is terrible.

Gal Gadot was quite good in her role and Chris Pine was fantastic! My favorite parts of the film were the scenes when the characters were just talking and taking the time to be developed. The film had a surprising amount of depth and I appreciated that. I was afraid WB/DC would try to mirror Marvel and for the most part they didn't which made me enjoy the film more.

The music in the film was also quite good.

On the negative side, though, I thought the villains were quite poor. The Ares reveal fell completely flat and it was just a missed opportunity and the General was just some pointless red herring. Doctor Poison was good, though. I really would've liked to see more of her. The majority of the third act was pretty weak in my opinion.

I'm glad they took the risk and killed off Steve Trevor in a very, very touching way. I was hoping the filmmakers would've done the same with the rest of Steve's team in a heroic and/or tragic way as well. I guess I could see them playing important roles in the sequel, though.

The development of Diana in the film could've been done a bit better in some scenes, I think. I wish Diana would've been able to take a moment and realize her powers. And I wish the ending would've been a bit more of a downer so it would line up with what Diana said at the end of Batman v Superman.

My absolute favorite thing about this film, though, was it's length and pacing. It felt like a film that wasn't rushed and didn't have scenes just cut out and/or re-arranged. It was an experience to behold and appreciate.

The present day scenes were a nice touch too. I'm glad they weren't forced into setting up some future DCEU film. They complemented the story being told.

[-what happened to the German ship at the beginning of the movie? The Amazons wouldn't take it out with arrows, and it would annihilate them with about 20 shells.
-why did the Amazon's not attack Steve on the beach? He was in a German uniform and was a strange man. For all they knew Steve was a mass murderer being chased by authorities.
-did they really imply that Steve and Diana hitched a ride from off the coast of Turkey to London in one night?
-did Wonder Woman handle all situations by charging headfirst into battle and seeing everything as black and white? It may have been done to flip the tropes of men in action movies, but her character had no nuance and, dare I say, didn't handle things with a feminine touch.
-the worst twist of any comic movie was that Diana was the true god-killing weapon. And why the hell did Ares tell her that she was the weapon and not the sword?!? It would be like Superman destroying Batman's sonic cannons that Bruce thought would kill him, only to say that his true weakness was kryptonite that he knew Batman had with him.
-why have all the German soldiers act all relieved and innocent after Ares was killed? Can they say they were mind controlled and not responsible for the war crimes they committed? This seems lazy and contrary to how real life works(albeit how real life is even in a comic book movie.)](#spoiler)

So, that's my thoughts. If I missed something let me know, but it was a fun movie just not as great as people are acting.",6erigc

I thought Gal Gadot was a fantastic Wonder Woman and really shone but some actors had clunky delivery of dialogue here and there. They also didn't spend much time developing side characters and the story seemed a little choppy, makes me wonder if there is a much longer edit around somewhere that was cut down for release.

Wonder Woman herself was awesome. She had some cool fight scenes and the actor was a good actor. The movie was just too long and completely unoriginal. Thor+Captain America set in WWI with a Greek goddess/demigod as the lead. The useless comedic side characters no one cares about, the same type of comedy, the same jokes, the same plot beats, the same cheesy CGI boss battle in the end, nothing about this movie was unique or interesting.

It makes me more disappointed in Man of Steel and Batman v Superman. The point of Superman is that he is a symbol of hope and aspiration. The last five years have been full of apologists explaining that Superman doesn't have to be that, and insisting that a movie with that wouldn't work. 

This was that movie. Patty Jenkins made Wonder Woman into that symbol, with a heroine whose main trait was a refusal to give up. That movie can be made, and it works beautifully. This was fantastic.

dicnk97,"WOW!! Blown away!!

I avoided all spoilers and everything I could to go in blind. I was apprehensive because BvS was decent (extended version was pretty good), and Suicide Squad was a shit mess (and I was so excited for that movie).

BUT WOW!! Probably one of my favorite comic book/adventure movies now. It felt a little like a mix of Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Mummy, Casa Blanca and some other classic movies. It was able to  walk a balance of those influences and maintain its own tone. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine were absolutely perfect, and I really liked their chemistry.

I think the no-man's land scene was one of my favorites and reminded me a bit of The Matrix, and there's good bullet-time like moments but not overly done. The action and direction were great! I liked the pacing and character development, and I like Gal's wonderment with going over the top.

I have to believe that any fan of Wonder Woman will be very, very happy with this movie. It brings me hope for the Justice League if they can maintain the quality of this movie. Great script writing, too--what a change from Suicide Squad which was an absolute mess.

Could be the movie of the summer. I think it's got a slight edge over Guardians 2 (which I just saw and also really liked).

A great day for comic book fans, and especially DC fans.",6erigc
dicnuxd,"So in this universe Wonder Woman is a better Superman *and* Batman than Superman or Batman. She's more inspiring and a better savior than Superman and she's more badass and merciful than Batman. I know bit of a stretch on the Batman comparison but when this version of Batman has basically just been a thug so far its pretty fair to see how she's just better at it.

Granted my expectations were very low going into this but I loved the film and thought it was very in tune with its audience. It took itself seriously like MoS and BvS without always being bleak and dire and characters being depressed or angry. It had some light hearted moments but they didn't force them into serious parts of the movie. The No Man's Land scene was absolutely fantastic and possibly the most ""heroic"" thing we've seen in a DC movie so far. Clark blasting through the world engine in MoS is a contender, but on screen nobody witnesses it so it doesn't have the same impact on other characters. 

I really enjoyed how they scaled Diana's power throughout the film so that her journey from skilled warrior to demi-god feels like a natural progression of realizing her potential. 

Some parts had a little too many slow motion action sequences reminiscent of 300. Also I can live with the idea that after Ares dies all the men around the fight just kind of lose the will to battle and sit down to contemplate the hell of war. But having guys that were literally just shooting and killing each other now bro hug it out felt very kumbuya.

This has renewed my faith in DC even though I still think Justice League is gonna be a pile of shit like BvS and Suicide Squad just cause they don't have time to reflect what worked here and utilize it in JL. But I'm more optimistic about DC films future than I have been since the first BvS trailer.",6erigc

dids768,"Been seing some comments complaining about WW's sudden powers in the fight vs Ares (especially the lightning), heres my interpretation

Early in the movie we see Diana create a shockwave when her aunt talks about fights not being fair etc etc and it's obviously something that shocked her and also the other amazonians (though they knew why it happened). im assuming most (myself included) thought the shockwave came from her bracelets when seemingly with the context of the rest of the movie it really came from her when she got emotional due to her aunt

the powers are something that she didnt know about since she didnt know she was a god/demi godess but she still had them and could instinctively use them once she got emotional (trevor's death, note the rage mode vs the germans after his death) + learned the truth.

and the lightning should be a huge part of her legacy as the daughter of zeus, since zeus is iconic for lightning. note that ares (her brother) also used lightning a lot.

now for why she mightve not used her powers in bvs:

1. she can only use them when emotional

2. she didnt see the need to use them since doomsday was pretty weak when compared to ares

3. she probably wouldve hurt batman and/or superman using them

4. they nerfed her cuz its a team up movie

5. they didnt want to reveal her powers before this movie and we can expect more of her powers going onwards


imagine if this movie kickstarted the dceu instead of man of steel, damn that would be sick.
",6erigc
didse3x,"I loved this movie. I even shed a tear in one particular scene. 

First my gripes: 
The CGI was a little weird in some scenes and looked like CGI and it distracted me a little bit. There were some small plotholes like the fact she speaks over 100 languages but she lives in an isolationist society for thousands of years. Maybe the Amazons go off into the real world in expeditions? There was another tiny plot hole somewhere that at the time seemed like a big deal but I have since forgotten what it is. Something small like that. But other than that not a lot to complain about.

The Amazons didnt get as much screen time without going further into exactly what I mean. You know who I'm talking about specifically. Wasted opportunity. 

The good:

Gal Gadot IS Wonder Woman. I absolutely loved her strength and grace at the same time. Even in scene with better actors like Danny Huston she held her own. But it was all the emotions she was able to portray that really gave this character life. Her idealism and naivety and this quiet fierceness. Very powerful character.

Chris Pine was also great. I usually don't like him but he was fantastic in this film. That scene at the end where he is trying to convince Diana to fight with him was the best in the entire movie, it was really awesome. 

People complained about Ares not getting enough screen time but I think for the purposes of the movie and the time limit he was a little more fleshed out than most Marvel villains and I am a marvel guy. At the same time when you have half the movie as a coming of age story its hard to focus on the bad guy. Especially when there were three of them + the war.

That moment in the no mans land scene when Diana goes up the ladder and into battle was one of the best superhero scenes of all time. It was breathtaking stuff. I love when the emotion the action and the music all come together at the right moment.

Lots of feminist moments throughout the film that I thought were terrifically placed without forcing the ideals. They were perfect putdowns to this society. 

Overall I would say it is the best origin story superhero film of all time. Definitely in my top 5. And a good film overall. Amazing... no ABSOLUTELY BREATHTAKING cinematography, good acting and dialogue with a leaky story and so so CGI that distracted from some scenes. It borrowed elements from both Captain America and Thor and did them better I think. I also think placing it in WW1 was a great call and fit the story better. And Diana was just awesome. Even precocious little girl Diana. ",6erigc
didwy3m,"I thought how they portrayed Ares was very unique and the exact opposite of what I was expecting then to do.

die33pr,"The only gripe I have is the ""power of love"" stuff. I felt it was really cringey at times, especially at the very end (back in present day), but get why it was there. Diana needed that emotional investment so she could realize her true potential/powers and beat Ares. Fair dues. It just pulled me out a bit. I didn't need a replay of Steve's goodbye where you hear exactly what they say. The chemistry they had showed their connection and I would have bought her reaction to his death without it.

It's probably not a great comparison, but I thought immediately of Rogue One, where Jyn and Cassian were able to accomplish as much without their relationship evolving nearly as far as we saw from Steve and Diana.

Again, it's a minor gripe, but the only thing that stands out as a con. The weak villains, I suppose, but I'm just used to that from superhero movies now. Loved the film and can't wait to see it again.",6erigc

Unfortunately after that, I felt like the movie just didn't know how to end itself. I wasn't sure who it would end up being, but I thought it was pretty obvious all along that Ludendorff wasn't really going to be Ares. 

The initial reveal that David Thewlis was Ares was kind of cool, but after that he became the same old ""surprise villain"" that I'm so sick of in every movie these days. On top of that, while I could buy him as a manipulator mastermind, I couldn't take him seriously as the ultra-violent god of war.

Lastly, given the whole ""nature of war"" thing they were constantly talking about in this movie, I'm surprised and a little disappointed that they never even mentioned WWII. Given that it takes place between the same countries on the same land, and not even 20 years later, I figured for sure it would come up at least in passing.

Just point out some things I have not seen here.

*Shout out to the little mermaid when she saves Steve from drowning.

*I loved that she was so naive and powerful at the same time.

*I wish Dr Poison [would had been revealed to be Ares](#spoiler). It would had been a very interesting plot twist and I think the actor would had sell the complex villain angle better.

*Another Steve down in a plane like a hero. If I were named Steve I would take the train everywhere I went from now on just saying.

*So that is what she meant when she said ""I had killed creatures from another world before in Batman vs Superman"" great call out.

*Also the look she gave Lois when she saw that Superman was dead has a lot more meaning now. ""Sister I know what is like or why do you men keep having to sacrifice themselves""

*I wish there was an explanation for the suit like it was just waiting for her for no reason.

*So obvious what was the God killer from the moment little Diana asked.

*The last fight could had been better but I liked that she managed to have access to this power and sill control it.

*I'm the only one that thinks that letting [spoilerDr Poison live was a mistake? I get the feeling that she whether create more weapons that eventually create more villains or that she could be Poison Ivy herself. She could become immortal or retain her looks with her science.](#spoiler)

*The lack of hair continuity was driving me crazy it was puffy, wavy, flat or curly in the same scene more than once. Better hair people next movie please.

*The Amazons are lazy as fuck. They were supposed to go out and help as the sacred mission they were given, but I guess life in the island is too good. ""Is okay bitches we got the league you can stay and train and train and train and never put your butts in line. Diana is the best of you all anyway.""

diikgn7,"It was a decent film. I liked the action sequences, especially the Amazonians in the beginning of the movie. I really wished they made the whole movie like that.

The bad: Movie tropes galore. 
Ares: I...am...a...god! So...I...must...speak...slowly. And...make...dramatic...hand...movements!
Also I understand it's a fish out of water story, but they made Wonder Woman into a damned robot. She's a member of royalty who's studied a thousand books! Give her a personality!

Not really any more ""feminist"" than any other movie. Sure, the movie starts off strong by showing the Amazonians and all their badassery, but in the main plot, there aren't any female characters with major roles. Sure, there's the female scientist villain Dr. Poison (easily my favorite character in the movie) but she's cancelled out by the ditzy secretary whom they gave an equal amount of screen time for some reason.

The main villain fights were kind of a letdown. They could have been fleshed out a bit.

90% of the action sequences are basically Wonder Woman blocking bullets with her bracers. I mean, that's just a lame superpower.


Could have used more Nazi punching too.


7/10",6erigc
diivk85,"Well, first of all I'd like to point out, that I really liked this movie. I know it wasn't perfect at all plus maybe I like it this much because I watched any movie in theatre so long ago and I was super excited. But I have some issues too like many others:

The three most bothering things to me:

* We saw WW in BvS too, where she fought with the sword, the shield and the whip (? maybe not the whip). But the sword got destroyed in this movie, and Diana's mother practically banished her from the island, soo how did she got another sword? I know it may seem to be just casuistry, but somehow this bothers me more than it should.

* Why did Diana's mother had to practically banish her? (I know it wasn't her exact words) Nobody said any reason for it through the whole movie. Or did I misunderstand it? My sister said that she thinks Diana's mother did not banish her, just meant that once she goes out to the human's world she won't be able to leave them. I'd be ready to accept this ""theory"" but since the main conclusion for Diana at the end of the story was that humans are basically as good as bad and they tend to choose the latter, I wouldn't think that she liked them so much to never go back to her home and to her beloved ones.

* I think it is bullshit that her mother said nothing about her origin/parentage to ""protect her"", because if she knew it, it would be too dangerous, even when she went out to the human world with the saint purpose to kill Ares. WTF?! Not telling her the truth IS making it more dangerous, because she is not prepared. (And she even didn't want her to practice, despite of the fact that it IS the main purpose of Diana's existence) Geez, this is the biggest bullshit in this movie I think. Plus as it is mentioned before she can't/couldn't (who knows which now) go back to her home, thus they won't meet ever again. What if she never finds out the truth then what? She won't know anything in her whole life? Please.. The best reason for this for me is that this way (that Ares told her the truth) they wanted to make a better climax for the plot, but still, I think this is very illogical for the given characters.

* One last thing: Same illogical bullshit to me is that Diana's mother, Hippolyta and her Amazons were the ones who fought off Ares with the help of Zeus, and now suddenly every one of them thinks and believes that no way that Ares lives, it is out of question for them. They even practiced combat through their whole life to be prepared when Ares living becomes reality. And now when the possibility for this is pretty big, they do nothing just deny everything and leave Diana on her own. Okay okay I know this film is about WW not about the Amazons, but still, this bothers me big time.

* (And one last last thing: It's maybe just me, but when I live in a world that is far far away from greek mythology on the contrary, it is a Christian world, and I just happen to find myself in the middle of the ancient greek mythology, I'd really freak out and wouldn't believe what's just happening. And Steve not just not freaks out (just calmly take a nice warm bath), but he even thinks that Diana is a little bit delusional (about Ares), even after they saw what she is capable of.)

Plus of course there were many other things that were a bit bothering, but others already mentioned it so I won't write it down again. It is totally a much better path for DC movies, that's for sure, but I could take a little bit more darkness than it was in this movie, that's how DC movies differs from Marvel movies. Lately in Marvel movies there is too much humor for me. I can't really feel the weight of the events since they just tell a one-liner or mock somebody or anything. But generally I like DC and Marvel movies (I don't get this anger between the two fanbase at all).

Despite of the many negative things that can be brought up against the movie, as I said, I really liked it and I'm really excited about a sequel, so for me it is a 8/10. And 10/10 I'll watch it again several times.

Overall id give a 7/10, a very important and well directed movie with great moments but the final 25 minutes stop it from being on the level of top superhero movies of all time.

dil8m8e,"just got back from watching ww, just a very brief off-the-top-of-my-head reaction...

**pros:**

gal gadot is growing! getting better as she takes more roles, and it doesn't hurt that she's ably supported by a wonderful chris pine and lucy davis(whom i've liked since the office/black books).

some cheesy moments aside (which is fine because it's a superhero movie! yay for not making it moody af)

also doesn't hurt that gal is ridiculously stunning in every shot, seriously her lips alone looked like fucking magic. jeeez

**cons:**

villains all sucked.  really sucked.  David Thewlis was a decent casting but as a final showdown, was just ...weird and out of place.  Danny Huston was a shitty stryker, and is here a shitty ...fake german guy - i really didn't even know his name throughout the film.

also; this (to be as cliche as possible) is 2017, I thought we were beyond having foreigners be played in badly accented english.  they even went to the effort of making a couple of scenes authentic in german and french/german/some kind of chinese/greek, so why the hell did they go and cast a non german speaker for a big bad german guy?

oh, themyscera (sp) is gorgeous looking.

overall, i don't regret giving my money to supporting a female-led AAA title, and it wasn't that bad a movie - on a par with captain america's first film.  but the language, or lack of, really pulled me out of the movie, all i could think of was [this](https://youtu.be/cxja0YhOUTM?t=13s)",6erigc
dim6b6n,"   It's pretty good. It's basically Thor 1 meets Captain America First Avenger, starring Wonder Woman, and a bit darker than either of them. Like most MCU movies, the villain isn't very memorable. But it's a fun time overall. 

  Gal Gadot is never going to sniff an Oscar, but she does quite well here. She's credible in the action scenes, has chemistry with Chris Pine, and conveys the emotions she needs to convey at least adequately every time. She does best in the comedic moments. And my God is she photogenic! In pretty much every frame she looks stunningly beautiful. I could swear she didn't look like *this* in BvS, and I barely noticed her in Furious 6 (I haven't seen the others she was in). I don't know if it's the makeup, the lighting, the way she carries herself here or all three, but she truly looks like a literal goddess in this movie.

  The supporting cast are generally where the really strong acting is found. I wasn't impressed by Little Diana but she's only around for a few minutes.

The action looks good and sometimes great. Slow motion is somewhat overused, however.

The climactic fight feels and looks a bit too much like the Doomsday fight from BvS. It's almost like Snyder snuck in at night to direct that part himself. It doesn't really drag down the movie much, but it prevents it from reaching it's potential.

The cinematography and music are strong.  Themiscyra has actual colors!  So the full spectrum does exist in this Dc universe. 

It's rather striking that a movie which includes quite harrowing (for its rating) depictions of World War One still manages to feel more optimistic than the last two Superman movies.  Actually, make that more than the last three.

I find the hallmark of a good superhero movie is in the antagonists. An antagonist to me should have a life outside of the hero, should have their own emotions and arcs. And that is what I felt from most of the villains in wonder woman. I got caught up in the enthusiasm of Doctor Poison and the stoicism of Ludendorff (who also did have his own moments of levity to break this up). I felt that the Imperial Germans were a bit too impersonal and was mildly disappointed in Ares.

dioapzl,"I really enjoyed the plot tie in with WWI.  I recently watched a documentary series about the great war and Eric Luddendorf had an episode about him.  Supposedly Luddendorf was in fact dead set on continuing the war and wanted nothing to do with the Armistice.  However, I don't believe he murdered his command staff with super mustard gas.  According to what I saw and have read, he was the defacto commander of German forces during the war but he was quite unhinged as a person.  He would frequently throw temper tantrums and roll on the ground like a child when he was delivered bad news of any real import.  He apparently got so bad in the 1917-1918 time frame that his subordinates quitely brought in a head shrinker to figure out just what hell is deal was.  

By the end of the war, after losing a son in law that he was really close with, he became seriously delusional.  By 1917, a good portion of the German army just kinda gave up.  The war, for all major combatants (Britain, France, Germany, Russia, Turkey, the serbs and the Austro-hungarians) had pretty much extinguished an entire generation of young men.  Snipers, insane artillery batteries, machine guns and tanks all made their ""modern day"" debut and the awesome killing power of all these things coupled with chains of command that had little to zero concern for the average joe resulted in combat deaths on a scale never seen before.  It's a horrible story and there were no real winners but it is an incredibly important piece of history as it set the scale for just about every clash, both hot and cold, that would occur during the rest of the century.  Definitely deserves more than half a day's study in 6th grade history class.

diim9jm,"I've got to be honest, I went in really hoping DC finally pulled off a bonafide hit, but I was really disappointed by many things. It was nowhere near as bad as BvS or SS, but I'm really baffled by the overwhelming positivity. My main problems:

1. **The ""progressive"" Steve/Diana relationship is built on a bedrock of cringey sex talk.** This instantly turned me off their romance. I cannot believe the first two conversations between the romantic leads are about sex. Really draggy, cringey and non-crucial conversations about sex. And it's the first thing they talk about! Hear that, young girls in the audience? The way to begin a meaningful relationship is to talk about dick size and sleeping together! Gee, isn't that empowering and not objectifying at all! Need I remind you these scenes happen mere moments after Diana's surrogate mother Antiope dies on the battlefield and her real mother disowns her? It was just so incredibly jarring and out of place to me. It really put a damper on what could have been a much more meaningful conversation about what Antiope meant to Diana or, I don't know, *literally anything else*. Isn't this movie being hailed as something of a landmark feminist film? Frankly, I'm a little offended and shocked no one's even mentioned this.

2. **The supporting characters are set up but never paid off.** Sammy, Charlie, The Chief, Etta, and Hippolyta are given big setups for later payoffs that never happen. I'm talking classic Chekov's Guns still hanging on the wall. Sammy wants to be an actor apparently. Is it paid off? No. In the climax, he even says he has an idea for how to sneak into the compound but he just has them all wear gasmasks. Boy! Really putting those acting skills to use, huh? Charlie has a really effective implied backstory that apparently left him with shell shock. Does he ever manage to overcome his fear and make a crucial shot? Nope. The Chief is apparently still just in it for the money. Etta is probably still just a secretary as far as the audience knows. Hippolyta is still on Themiscyra resenting her daughter. You know why everyone loves Back to the Future? They pay off *everything*. Setup and payoff are the marks of taut and professional storytelling but they just dropped the ball on almost every character in Wonder Woman.

3. **The Slooooooooowwww-Mo.** Unquestionably, the most prevalent directorial choice in this movie is the slow-motion. I guess your mileage may vary, but I found it *really* excessive in this movie. I feel the action would have been far more exciting if everything ran at a normal speed, and I further believe it wouldn't have been hard to follow. Even if you chalk the slow-mo up to a personal preference, I find it interesting that Patty Jenkins used, *heavily*, the most identifiable Zack Snyder directorial trait. Monster isn't loaded with slow-mo. All I'm saying is I'm not sure we need to start hailing Jenkins as some great auteur. Along with the washed-out palette, she's clearly adopting the house-style.

4. **Too much ripping off Captain America: TFA (and not as well).** I'm sorry to stir the old Marvel vs. DC pot here, but Wonder Woman has too many similarities with the first Captain America film to be ignored (because you *know* these filmmakers watch each others' movies). Obviously, the climax where Steve sacrifices himself in the plane, but consider the London-based spy organization, the knockoff Howling Commandos and the recruitment scene in the bar, the main German villain with the evil scientist underling who take out the higher-ups to fulfill their even-more evil agenda, the hero defying orders to carry out a one-man mission that was seen as suicide but ends up succeeding. There are even a lot of similar elements between the Steve/Peggy and Steve/Diana romances. Oh, and the shield. I'm joking about that last one, but there are seriously too many coincidences for them to just be coincidences.

5. **Diana killing Ludendorff and Ares.** This one almost bothers me as much as Superman breaking Zod's neck in Man of Steel. Throughout the movie, we're told Diana and the Amazons belong to this race of beings created by the gods to mediate man's wayward tendencies to, like, kill and rape and stuff. They're supposed to be these paragons of virtue and peace. What does Diana do to bring peace? Kill the enemy. Then she decides to spare one of her other enemies and then she kills the final enemy. What kind of consistency in message is that? The hypocrisy of it all is pretty unforgivable, in my opinion. She also kills a lot of German grunts. I mean, Diana is pretty much the most killingest force in the whole dang movie! It's some very mixed messaging and very hypocritical. I think they really could have at least handled the Ludendorff and Ares killings in a more tonally-faithful way. (By, y'know, *not killing them?*)


6. **Slow pace.** Again, mileage may vary in this case. All I know is that whenever a scene went on too long, the guy sitting next to me in the theater would check his phone. Happened about 6 times during the movie. Kind of annoying, but I couldn't really blame him. A great deal of these scenes just go on WAY too long. I felt every minute of the 2hr 21min runtime when I wanted to be engrossed. This movie easily could have been under 2 hours if you cut out the slow-mo and some of the excessive bickering and pandering sex talk.

I'm sorry if this seems harsh, I'm focusing on the bad. I'd probably give this movie a 5 or 6. There's still a lot to like. I thought the plot was pretty good. Diana naively thinking she could end war by taking out Ares and Steve using Diana's naivety to his advantage was a good set up. I liked the supporting characters *better* than the Howling Commandos, they just never paid them off. Like at all. I enjoyed that exposition sequence about the gods that looked like a baroque/renaissance painting. Themiscyra was pretty gorgeous to look at.

I just think there was a lot that missed the mark here, unfortunately.",6erigc

dicrqln,"Just got out of a showing.

If I had to give DC a progress report, it would say ""Shows Improvement"".

Finally after years of disappointment DC has an incredibly solid movie on their plate. While it had its issues (particularly the pacing, use of the extended cast, and some of the CGI in my opinion) overwhelmingly Wonder Woman is a fantastic and thoroughly enjoyable film.

I sincerely hope DC can ride the moment this will no doubt generate and continue to improve; if so, I believe we all can expect some fantastic movies in the coming years.

Now that I'm done gushing, it's time to discuss the weaknesses this film suffered from.

Pacing - I felt like in some places the movie was slow when it needed to be fast, and in some places it was fast when it needed to be slow. Especially in the opening prior to Diana leaving the island, there was definitely room to compress some of the sequences without losing any meaningful content. And later in the film, I felt like Steve and Diana needed more time to be able to discuss their 'philosophical' differences; many of their conversations came off as rushed with Diana seeming inordinately obstinate when Steve had valid points. This is especially sad because I felt like (as is typical) the culture clashes between the two were some of the clear highlights of the film.

Use of the Extended Cast - I always get disappointed when in a movie a text gets assembled but then outside of the main characters the rest are underused or reduced to just one note characters. Star Wars Rogue One for example had this problem. I feel like if the movie takes the time to do a ""recruitment"" scene then the characters deserve better than getting their one schtick before getting tossed to the side. Similarly, I thought the Doctor was underdeveloped when, as the scene where Steve tries to seduce her using information from her journal shows, there could have been more going on that made her character a bit more dimensional.

CGI - some of the fight scenes looked really cool. I think most people will agree that the scene where Diana saves the small village, plowing through buildings and dodging enemies in the occasional slow motion sequence, was fantastic. In comparison, some of the CGI in the final fight looked almost ridiculous and in one or two occasions even unfinished. Disappointing from such a high profile film.

Ultimately I still recommend seeing this film, it is a huge step up over anything DC has out out this far and that alone merits a view in my book.",6erigc

While this is hardly the first female superhero film, it is being hailed as such because it is the first successful one. Its historical setting works well in the movie as it underlines female power by juxtaposing the early 20th century inequality with Diana's opinionated fervor and characters wax philosophical about good versus evil. However, in terms of visuals and story it is extremely similar to the first Captain America with a dash of Thor. The film's well balanced humor and light moments also feel like a page from Marvel's book, making Wonder Woman by far the least dark of the brooding DC movies. Gal Gadot's weak acting abilities prove she was cast mainly for her physical presence and that coupled with many cheesy moments and an overuse of slow motion diminish the film's overall quality. Surprisingly, even the special effects are sometimes lacking, with obvious green screen compositing and a messy (and completely derivative) final battle. Wonder Woman is by no means a bad movie, but it is so wholly average and formulaic that superhero fatigue sets in by the time one gets to the third act. ",6erigc
dikd6vj,"Just got out of a showing.

I found the movie very mediocre and very alike Marvel's Captain America. Although while I'm not a fan of both DC and Marvel, superhero movies in general are fun to watch sometimes but they are losing their touch. Every villain feels the same. Every fight has the same soundtrack, same fight style, same slowmo cuts and camera shots. The difference being just having a darker shade throughout the movie and more CGI with Dragonballz type of fighting in the end. This is all I come to expect from DC movies now.

If there is one thing that I wish to see improved is the use of the soundtrack and some silence. I feel like a lot of scenes would benefit better with some silence rather than the same generic themed track that quietly plays in the background. 

For example I feel like the scene where Diana finds the gassed village, it would of been heavier on emotions if Diana rushes in there with absolute silence and doing something else besides having a corny slow mo shot of her slowly looking around crying with the sad track in the background that I swear I've heard 100 times in every Marvel / DC movie.

I just couldn't buy it. I understand it sounds like I'm being an annoying nitpicker but I couldn't shake this off through out the whole film.

It's a shame too, because you can tell this was a movie made with real love and care. Jenkins' direction is sincere and solid as hell, from fun character moments to frenetic action beats. On top of that, the cast across the board is fantastic, with Gal Godot owning the role by an awesome degree and proving any remaining naysayers how wrong they were.

I feel like this movie tries so hard in making up for the ""darkness"" of BvS, with it's positive message of love, that it end up just being extremely corny. She beat Ares with love....we get it....love is good, but mah god, that was a hammy scene. 

And on Ares....he's just there....I felt like he was a non-character, only there to give us a cool fight at the end. And he fight was pretty cool, so success?

The CGI was horrendous at times, honestly took me out of a lot of the fights, and i'm surprised no one is complaining about the liberal use of slow motion. Get ready to click that down vote arrow but if this were a Snyder movie I think he would've been crucified for the slow motion usage in this film. 

The child actress was bad....sorry...

I general this felt like a gender swapped TFA....and that scene where Ares shows her the vision of a human-less world was ripped straight from Man of Steel.

dici48c,"Best DC Film in the cinematic universe, and the most enjoyable comic book films I've seen since The Winter Soldier.

I can't stop thinking about how well rounded it was. It was equally as funny as it was sad and I think Patty and the cast did a great job of letting each emotion have it's time and place.

Patty should be commended for how she made the war feel heavy without being in-your-face gruesome. That's not a knock at Logan and Deadpools R-rating, I enjoyed them both, but for this film I think it was the right choice to paint the picture in a way that wasn't as... shocking. The weight of the situation was told through Diana's naivety and compassion, rather than through beating the issue over the audiences head with a sledgehammer.

The rest of the DC and WB creative teams need to take note of the pacing in Wonder Woman. There was non-stop action, yet it never felt unwarranted or drawn out. Dialogue never dragged on, and I didn't find myself having to really force myself to focus on what was being said. The film had funny, lighthearted moments scattered throughout, blended with charming, heartwarming exchanges that kept me emotionally attached to the characters and, at times, aided to the gravity of the situation.

The three big actors were highlights for me. Gadot and Pine were fantastic and I don't need to give much explanation why, so I'll keep it short: chemistry. Every scene with then together was like alchemy. Daniel Thewlis however, was another standout. He obviously had much less screentime, but I thought he made the most of the time he did have. The monologue before the final battle was fantastic in how it not only enlightened us to his perspective (and also proved that mankind were ultimately responsible for the destruction of the world around us) but it was a point of contention that has been brewing within Diana's story arc throughout the entirety of the film, leading up to that point. Thewlis delivered it perfectly. He was as charming as his first act appearances; yet sinister and unnerving, as the God of War should be.

I didn't think I'd care of the motley crew of supporting characters. However, the scene following No Man's Land, where Diana's eyes are made open to the fact that she's not the only one fighting her own battle really took them from 1D, cardboard cutout characters to tangible proof of how The War affected society on so many different levels. We often just think 'civilians are people; soldiers are soldiers' like when the British General exclaimed, ""That's what soldiers do, Captain!"" in response to letting the soldiers on The Front die. However, each member of the team had their own quirks and personality (including Etta) and each performance made me care for them as people, where they could have easily have been forgettable and plot fodder.

Wonder Woman may not be the film we deserved, but it is the one ~~we needed right now~~ I believe in.",6erigc
diclgr9,"So I did really enjoy the movie, I think Gal Gadot is a perfect Wonder Woman and it was definitely the best film in the DCEU, however my biggest problem with DC right now is how much potential there movies versus what we're given. I think this movie is perfectly okay but not ""blow my socks off"" good. To me I feel like they could have done some really interesting stuff Greek gods in this universe and it just felt like they played it all really safe. I really hate how much CGI is used in all their movies and in this one it seemed especially strange. Also I think it's strange that they just confirmed that Greek Mythology is true and that's how we were created, it was just weirdly softballed in but that's a huge thing. For me it feels like Warner Brothers isn't focused on making genuinely good movies with a well written universe, they just want to be ""cool"" and have ""cool and dark"" characters. That being said I did enjoy this movie and laughed and some of the combat scenes were badass, I just left feeling like I should have gotten more creativity out of it. But it might just be me.

P.S I think they really should have done more songs in the soundtrack that were like the electric guitar one. That's a really cool sound and I wanted more of it, not just for it to pop up at certain parts.",6erigc
dicv0e0,"I liked the movie, the characters were very lovable, the funny parts were pretty funny, the action was good but nothing special, pacing was a bit weird to me and the serious parts were pretty cliche filled to my liking, over all good but nothing too special

I really didn't like the [sacrifice part, to me it felt like there were a million way they could have solved the problem without Steve dying but they had to make him die in order to make Diana's faith sorted, not as bad as ""lol ur mom is martha too"" tho so baby steps I guess](#spoiler)",6erigc

I mean, the guy is cocky, rides an old motorbike, is actually a captain in the war, and it kinda irks me. Hehe...""irks"". That being said, other than Ares being supremely disappointing, though I'm not sure what I expected from a CBM villain, everything else was spot on. Wonder Woman was well done, thanks to Gal Gadot, soundtrack is excellent, the origin story as a whole was nicely done. Movie was great, first DCEU movie I can confidently get behind and recommend.",6erigc
did2gl5,"One thing I came out of Wonder Woman reflecting on was this was exactly what I wanted the first Captain America movie to be (which still remains in my Top MCU movies). 

It felt like the proper marriage of the superhero and war genres. Much of the action Captain America: The First Avenger are standard super-heroic set pieces while the wartime exploits are reduced to a montage sequence. The Howling Commandos are a colorful-*looking* group but the large cast size and lack of focus leaves them mostly flat and forgettable.

In contrast, I think Jenkins' choice of focusing on intimacy of sorts really benefitted the movie. Using a single wartime battle (instead of a montage) as a primary set piece let us finally see what a superhero looks like on an early-20th Century battlefield. A smaller group of colorful supporting characters allows us to feel their camaraderie and care for them both during and after the action. 

Again, this is not an opportunity to knock on The First Avenger--one of my favorite superhero movies. I understand why they opted for the more pulpy ""Raiders"" tone to cement the character as a Golden Age figure for his later appearances in modern times. But Wonder Woman managed to capture that same charm (with a little of Donner's ""Superman"" as well) while also not shying away from the gritty and visceral Saving Private Ryan/Band of Brothers style of war filmmaking.

It was a spectacle with emotional investment to be sure. Great movie.",6erigc

didf3ah,"It feels like these movies are being aired out of order. This one feels like it should have come first. Suicide Squad should've after we'd had time to get to know those characters in their respective movies.

One reason that this one works so much better is because we're actually finding out *who* Wonder Woman is. She has a personality outside of being a superhero. Both Clark and Bruce's personalities (in the DCEU films at least) revolve entirely around their identities as superheroes.

This movie doesn't show me who Wonder Woman, the hero, is. It doesn't even mention her by name. It shows me who *Diana* is. And it's so much better for it.",6erigc
dieenox,"This movie was so good. I do have one complaint, and I'm wondering if anyone agrees. As a protagonist, she has a fatal flaw, her naivete. The idea that she thinks the world is black and white, good and evil. 

I felt that came to a head when she killed the general guy and realized that people were still doing evil things. The ares thing just felt kinda unnecessary, like she could have learned the lesson there. Obviously they couldn't take that out as-is, and having two gods fight is pretty cool. But it just had little consequence on the story. Ares, generic superhero bad guy, had little to no personality, and it's not like killing him has any effect on the world. War still exists after she kills him. There are obvious issues with this, like the fact that the entire story falls apart, but it just felt so real up to that point and then got very cheesy (not necessarily in a bad way...). I liked the idea that she was wrong about ares, but she ended up being right, kinda?

In movies like this, we know the protagonist probably won't be *physically* challenged too much, since she's literally a god of some sort, so I think that was a really smart way to give it meaningful conflict that carried weight.",6erigc

dicrjln,"I haven't really seen it posted here so far, but am I the only one that was torn out of the movie by the lazy plot writing? I really wanted to like it, and I think that I did, overall. But, seriously?!? Some of the plot framework was just atrocious!! 

Sailing from the Ionian Sea to London overnight? I could even buy it if they just straight up said it was a magic Amazonian boat, but hitching a ride with a fucking tugboat?! Through some of the most militarized seas in the history of the world? That's lazy fucking writing.

Chris Pine posing as a German Colonel approaching a German scientist at at German gala and speaking English with a German accent?! ~~That's inexcusably lazy fucking writing.~~ SEE EDIT 2


Edit: Also, making Erich Ludendorff a mustache-twirling villain seemed strange to me. I really didn't like it. I mean, sure, the guy was a total war hawk and kind of went a bit off his rocker in his later years, but I don't think he necessarily deserved that portrayal. I don't see why the writers couldn't have just invented some evil colonel or something to fill that role. 

Edit 2: Upon closer thought, I'm willing to give the ""German Accent"" scene a pass. It's clearly established from the get-go that Trevor is an intelligence agent and that he has gone under cover as a spy among Germans in the past. Since his ability to pass as German is previously stated in the script,  the scene becomes much less ridiculous,  as the dialogue is clearly in  translation for audience convenience. I didn't complain when Indiana Jones did it,  I won't complain now.

did9gwu,Yikes this movie.  That third act was not good and felt like a bad Captain America film ...right down to the guy named Steve flying the experimental German WMD plane away and sacrificing himself.   There is a lot to like in this movie and it's the best DCEU film to date but it's still not very good.,6erigc
die5wxj,"Am I the only one who hated this movie? Cause it sure seems to be that way.

My main problem was how many inconsistencies there were. What are Ares' powers? He can basically control matter yet he loses to someone punching him in the face. Why is he so obviously ahead at the beginning of the fight and completely stop her whip with air, yet he cant stop it later? Why doesn't he teleport after they leave the tower. Wonder Woman also seems to have a random grab bag of powers. She does that thing with her wrists during training and never does that again? What causes her to go super saiyan and kill all those soldiers during her fight with Ares? 

The problems don't just stop with the god's powers. That blue vile was introduced out of nowhere and Dr. Poison mentioned it as an afterthought. Why does only the general use it and it isn't even mass produced. How did Chief steal a truck? How does no one notice Wonder Woman's sword down her dress?She also just happens to find a lady on her own to steal clothes and the invitation from. I mean come on. How did no one find the island till WWI? There are some other things I noticed but they've slipped my mind. 

A lot of people complimented the action scenes, which granted were awesome, but to me she was too overpowered. Like anime level of overpowered. I understand that its a superhero movie and there's no way she'd die, but at least make it seem like its difficult for her. Iron Man almost loses to the iron monger. Captain Rogers has a tough time dealing with the Winter Soldier. Even batman from the Nolan trilogy loses to Bane in the beginning. There was no time where she had to exert herself to get the job done, which made the action scene a lot less enjoyable. 

Those are my main problems. Thoughts? Everyone seems to love this movie, and I just don't get it.

Edit: Also the beginning was so slow. The exposition felt sloppily handled.

dick26q,Not sure if Wonder Woman or Captain America: The First Avenger female version....,6erigc
difen04,"People giving this a 9/10 baffle me. It's a decent movie entirely wrecked by the 3rd act. The same stupid, uninspired ""throw stuff at each other, shoot beams, and run into each other making huge explosions"" shit that nearly every superhero movie does (especially DC stuff) makes these ending battles SOOOO boring. They give us all of these cool sword fighting moves on the island, and during the war stuff, and then abandon it at the end because they're gods?

Also, Thewlis being Ares was pretty obvious to me. Same goes for Diana herself being the ""god killer"". I guess have seen too many of these movies to be surprised by any reveals in them.

I think this movie is getting a lot of praise because of two reasons: 

-It's both led and directed by women. Honestly I'm fine with this. I thought Gadot was badass, and the movie was well directed outside of the final battle. More representation is great! (Really looking forward to Atomic Blonde. Women can and should be leads in movies!)
- It's the first DCEU movie to not be a clusterfuck (I though Man of Steel was OK though).

At the end of the day, people's opinions are their own and they are entitled to them. If people thought this was a NEAR FLAWLESS movie, which is what a 9/10 represents, than I'm glad they enjoyed it.

Also, I gotta say, I like the street level characters more in terms of how the action is written and directed. Batman, Spider Man, Captain America, etc. are just more fun to watch. I feel like the super powered characters just don't get the best action stuff. Maybe it's just because we know what a punch and a kick feel like, and seeing that on screen is relatable.

Also, has anyone explained what the deal with Danny Huston's character is? Dr Poison makes him those super powered smelling salts, and says ""this will help you get your power back"". What power? 

TL:DR it's a 6/10, maaaaaaybe a 7/10 if we're grading on the superhero movie curve.",6erigc

dicvwfj,"My key word would be ""uneven"". 

It was like 3 movies of wildly varying quality were smooshed together. There was some good stuff in there, **some** of the action scenes were great and the characters were likeable, but the tone was all over the place. 

There were weird transitions within a single scene, for example why would Diana forget her sword on the roof of the hut, then in the next scene oh ok Ares just let her grab it before continuing his monologue. Why wouldn't she just retrieve the sword during the talk with Steve? Why have her realise it's missing with a shocked look? Was there a cut scene where she struggles to recover it?

The giant middle battle was also super-uneven. No Man's Land was pretty good, and the loft/street double battle was some solid punchin'. But it then transitions to the battle in the square where Steve is standing in the open and Diana is doing cheap-looking videogame moves on weightless ~~Nazis~~ Germans. The sidekick squad then doing some suicidal nonsense to set up Diana for her finishing move on the sniper tower didn't really flow for me.

It follows your everyday superhero movie formula Marvel has exploited to the point where it's getting annoying with a war setting (which Captain America did first anyways).

It had all the makings of a good MCU movie (good story, charismatic characters, well-timed humor that doesn't feel forced, shitty villain) but with that epic, larger than life feel to it that really separates DC characters from Marvel characters. You can really feel that Patty Jenkins put her heart and soul into this movie, it feels very fresh and doesn't have that manufactured and generic feel like a Marvel's movies have had as of late. 

Gadot is also PERFECT as Wonder Woman, I think this movie will shut up all of the haters who've been shitting on her casting. She was perfectly charismatic, charming, and adorable but also hardened and warrior-like when she needed to be. After watching this movie it's really hard to picture any other actress in her shoes. 

The absolute best thing WB/DC can do at this point is pull Snyder from all these movies and put Jenkins in charge, she's proven with this film that she has a perfect grasp of what a DC movie should be. Snyder's grim dark approach isn't working at all and the more lighthearted, humorous approach they took with Suicide Squad just felt very forced. This movie struck the perfect balance. I was also pleasantly surprised at how well done her action scenes were, they actually felt more intricately choreographed, stunning and awe-inspiring to watch than Snyder's usual action scenes.

I was actually surprised to see Ares as well. I figured they'd save him for the inevitable sequel and when he did show up it was surprising as who. But then the film has her fight him in his ""human"" form and I was bummed we wouldn't see him all decked out. The film then completely shocked me by giving me an Ares vs Wonder Woman fight I would have never thought I would see. 

I haven't even got into the actual meat of the movie which is the story. It was a joy to see from beginning to end. Chris Pine was great as someone other than Chris Pine. Gal Gadot can seriously act. Some stupid shit she said in the movie, but she sold it beautifully. She didn't play it dumb even though she was supposed to be. She came off as sincere.

This film pleases the D.C. nerd in me and it pleases me as a film guy. Beautifully executed.  2017 is going to end up being the best year in movies. The only bad movie I've seen this year is Baywatch. Every other film has been good or great.

The main leads Gal and Chris are phenomenal, Played their characters well and the chemistry is electric. The Amazonians (The queen and the general) and the Steve's crew were really likeable. The action sequences are intense since the film made it felt like that Wonder Woman is vulnerable to the weapons of the bad guys unlike Superman that could take a thousand of explosives. No man's land was truly a scene of sheer epicness. The Scenery was beautiful in Themyscira while the places affected by the Great war was dark, grey and moody, I liked this contrast a lot since it made sense considering the state of both worlds. The film felt tight and had a lot of good character moments. The message of the movie was clear and left me with hope as I leaved the theater.

- The beach scene is total garbage: bad green sceen(throughout the movie), shitty wire-work, bad editing and CGI.(it's bad throughout the whole film. The same goes to BvS and SS. WB/DC need to find new VFX studio.)

- No man's land scene was overly stylized with a slomo overkill and it's kinda a dumb scene.

And this is supposed to be a feminist movie?  Why?  Because the hero was a girl?  That's the only thing I could figure out.  She still had to be pulled through the story by men.  Women acting like men is not feminism.  Women besting men by acting like women would be more convincing.

Basically, the moral of the story is [people are both good and bad on both sides of a conflict](#spoiler).  The ""twist"" of the Ares character was not foreshadowed (that I noticed, at least) and also not particularly interesting - yes, he was a [good guy](#spoiler) and that goes with the moral of the story, but it could have been any of the [good guys](#spoiler) and it would not have changed the story a bit.

Secondly, the villain was flat and without any real motivation. The final fight at the end was... just typical cgi fun, but nothing meaningful or different than any superhero movie we've seen in the last decade. 

The representations of WW1 were also lacking... and the film really trivialized the true realities of the front in exchange for a cheap plot gimmick of some mass poison. WW fighting 5 or so Germans while running across no man's land? And then empty trenches behind? Was this just laziness or a lack of research? Either way.. this depiction was very dissapoiting.

I wouldn't say its a bad movie, but I don't think its good either. I have many issues with it, some big, many small. But the most important thing that irks me is:


WW in this movie is a fcking hypocrite. During the whol film but especially at the end she goes on and on about 'war bad - killing evil - war evil' etc, WHEN IN TWO DAYS SHE RACKED UP A BODY COUNT HIGHER THAN HER 4 SIDEKICKS' COMBINED... This is huge and it undermines the whole movie to me :(


The rest are small things, but still bother me. The visual look of the movie is the typical Snyderesque overly processed super fake looking nonsense. It gets incredibly bad during explosion, but especially during the final ""showdown"". Nothing looks real. Not a single thing. The villain turns from interesting into  Generic-bulky-fullCGI-armored-up baddie #7. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyy? It bothers me how they made the germans to be the bad guys again. Ffs this is the first World War not the second, there was no clear ""bad guy"" this time. Just soldier fighting for their country on all sides. Whenever there is a big, wide shot of WW fighting it looks so fake. Its not as bad when we get a little closer. When WW is not being a hypocrite she acts like a bratty child. Calling the biggest metropolis on the world, far beyond anything she ever imagined, 'hideous'. Trevor asks her nicely to stay put FOR A FEW MINUTES, she immediately ignores him. ""this is dance? pffffffff ours is better"" ""you got a paid job, lady? pfffffffff slavery"" ""maimed and wounded people everywhere, dyin- GASP those people are beating the horses - WHAT SAVAGERY""

There was a lot left to be desired here, and I can't believe you're all talking about it like it deserves the high critics ratings it's getting. 

The plot holes throughout the movie were jarring to the point of being distracting and slightly annoying. 

There were so many unnecessarily long and pointless scenes (like the dress choosing scene where she spends longer picking an outfit than actually wearing it... why??) 

I also found the treatment of WW1 slightly distasteful. As a person who is used to portrayals of WW1 as being hellish slaughterhouses; the relatively clean portrayal of no mans land seemed to make light of the pain and sacrifices soldiers endured during that conflict. 

Dialogue? At times funny, endearing and really made me connect with the characters. At others, felt stunted awkward and too much like how my own real world conversations sound like. 

There multiple realism issues as well which made me laugh. Some of my favourites:
Going to sleep on an underway sailing boat and miraculously ending up where you hoped to go. Riding a WW1 era motorcycle which even looks like it has nitro ex engine for an engine, and have it sound like a big four stroke and handle like a motorcross bike. I do give credit for having the amazonians get their asses handed to them properly by some ransoms with modern weapons (though it raises the question of why we went through the process of watching them train so hard). Storming a German air base and meeting almost non-existent resistance even when the general comes under attack.

There's a lot more wrong too, like editing, pacing, suspense buildup, and character development.

Tl;dr The movie is great fun but it just does not deserve the praise it gets as a piece of film.

difouf0,"Am I the only one who thought this movie was okay at best? I mean, count the number of cliches in this movie and it's insane. It's certainly not bad. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are excellent and the action is top notch, especially the No Man's Land scene. But the plot was so riddled with cliches and stereotypes (a smoke signal? Really?) that I kept getting taken out of the movie",6erigc

difwl5o,"This movie was a very generic superhero movie, I don't understand how people think this will define all superhero movies. I felt like the story dragged on and the only good parts of the movie were shown in the trailer. I'll say this is on par with BvS but better than Suicide Squad and worse than MoS. I'd give it about a 6.5/10",6erigc
dihcqj9,"OK, good movie, but with some serious flaws.

1) WW1 through Hollywood eyes. WW1 was shitty. Both sides (Central and Allies) were shitty. We all did things we're not proud of. Chemical warfare was born during this war and cost thousands of lives on both sides. However, this film seems to paint the Allies as shinning bastions of peace while the Germans are the evil aggressors who enslave villages and murder civilians... This narrative would've been more suited to a WW2 setting but then almost all of the jokes in the first act about Diana being a woman would not work. This point leads directly on to my second gripe

2) We get it, she's a woman. Too much time in the first act is spent showing Diana getting into ""hilarious"" situations as a result of her not understanding the position of Women in 1917 London. It was funny for about 15 minutes, then it gets old.

3) Subtitles. Why do all the Germans speak English with a German accent? Are they speaking German (a la 'Allo 'Allo)? Do the film makers think that the audience could not focus on too many subtitles? Clearly the film has no problem with subtitles as the scene between Diana and Sameer proves. And don't get me started on Chris Pine's German accent...

4) The big bad reveal. This is a prime example of a badly written twist. Randomly picking out a minor character and making him the bad guy all along is extremely lazy writing. A well written twist has you look back over the film and see all of the subtle hints or clues that you missed, or when you watch the film again with someone else, has you hiding sly looks to see if they have picked up on the hidden secret. Ares' reveal was so meh. A better ending (IMO) would have been for Diana to have been wrong all along, and have her faith in mankind restored by Steve's sacrifice.

5) Unexplained plot points. What happened to the battleship that came through the mist? Why was the general hitting that gas that made him super strong? Why not give that to all the German soldiers? What's the reason for Hippolyta refusing Diana's training? How did Etta find out where Ludendorff and Maru were? Why did the Chief suddenly start fighting with WW and Steve even though he made it clear that he does not take sides? What haunts Charlie's dreams? If the island has been sealed off for thousands of years how can Diana speak modern Chinese? These are the only points I can remember 12 hours after I watched the film, but I'm sure there were more.

These points aside though, it was a thoroughly entertaining flick. The action set-pieces are spectacular; I particularly enjoyed the beach scene, although there was a bit too much slo-mo for my liking, but that a Snyder staple so I was expecting it. Gadot and Pine are strong leads, even if they are let down by some of the dialogue they were expected to deliver, and the direction is pretty good.

divn57a,"I'm generally not into superhero movies although I liked The Dark Knight. I found this movie to be terrible. The movie had an extremely generic WW2 cookie-cutter plotline - I don't understand why this was set in WW2 to begin with. I was interested in the Amazon world in the beginning and don't understand why they didn't keep up with that. 

Gal Gadot did a good job but even her character was a bit one-note and the naïveté was getting a little played out in this nearly 2.5 hour movie. The rest of the characters were very bland - Chris Pine was as generic as a character can be and the other guys seemed very out of place and just boring. 

The conflict of the movie was very simplistic and the villain was uninteresting as well - just nothing to him. 

Weak plot, flat characters, lazy world-building, and probably an hour too long. I don't understand the appeal although the 11 year old I took enjoyed it.

dj1qm5u,"This film was just messy, cheesy, and tedious, which sucks because I had really high hopes for Wonder Woman. It seems like DC is just hiding bad movies behind great trailers (Suicide Squad, Man of Steel, etc.). The chemistry between Gal Gadot and Chris Pine felt wooden as hell but that was probably thanks to poor writing, worse direction, and no sense of pacing. Wasn't expecting Claire Underwood to be a badass Amazon warrior though, so props for that.

dichjdy,"This is the movie I've been hoping WB would make for the past few years. It was able to show the darkest part of mankind, the horrors of war and the affect war can have on people, and even after showing all of that still being able to have a hopefully attitude towards mankind without feeling out of place. I'm not too sure how this led to Wonder Woman abandoning humanity before BvS but I'll let it slide because this was such a good movie.

Only few nitpicks I have are that I'm still not really convinced Galdot can handle serious scenes really well, over time I think she will get better but I wasn't convinced of many of her line reads in this movie. There was a bit too much slow-mo during fight scenes. I didn't really care for most of the ""awkward""/sexual tension scenes between Diana and Steve and felt a little too cliched for me.  Also wish they didn't share a kiss in the movie, it just felt like it was in there because of the comics.

dictt3y,"Based on the first three DC movies the bar for Wonder Woman to cross was already very very low but Wonder Woman still high jumps it with style. Because it's a self contained origin story mean there are little sub plots going off, or the laying out of an intricate though inexplicably complex plot, which keeps the story simple. There's loads of humour, the action is badass. 

Gal Gadot is brilliant as Wonder Woman. Had this been just another male super hero, it probably wouldn't have been as special. The scene in which she goes over the top into No Man's Land, is just badass but it's symbolically important as well. There are so many superhero movies being released today, but Wonder Woman seemed to remind me of why these stories are important. 

Elsewhere, her story contains everything you would expect from a fish out of water story, this Amazonian woman entering this world where women are only just about to gain the vote. They don't toughen her up or make her emotionless, despite being a badass, she still has a softness and especially in this movie a degree of naivety that makes her fallible. 

As far as superhero movies go, I think it's as good as the first Captain America movie. Easily one of the better blockbusters of the year so far. It might lose it towards the end, but it never lost sight of it's characters or their relationships with one another in the way Man of Steel, BvS and Suicide Squad did.

[Just asking because Wonder Woman does fly in the cartoons.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eyvZRtGNNo)  If they do give WW the power of flight, they need to have a bigger budget because just hanging in the air on a rope in front of a green screen looked cheesy in the 80s much less today.",6erigc

djp9sb4,"OK, so I'm a little behind because I've been busy, but I just got home from the movie, and let me just say...I LOVED it.  This was the first film of the DC movie universe that I didn't have to make excuses for to enjoy. 

First of all, Gal Gadot IS Wonder Woman, as much as Robert Downey Jr. is Iron Man.  Sorry Linda Carter, but you've been replaced.  She was strong but feminine, kind but brutal when needed.  And my god, does the woman look like a work of art or what?  

Everybody in the theater (which was packed btw, which for a 4 week old release, even on Canada Day weekend, is impressive) was laughing and cheering through the whole thing. Except during the No Man's Land scene.  There was a hushed silence at the fight scene and how well it was done.  This is the kind of thing that Scott Snyder (and yeah I know he didn't direct, but his influence was felt here) does really well. 

The rest of the actors did a decent job, especially Chris Pine (although I would have liked some more background on Steve Trevor's character) but I will say that Ares was a bit miscast.  Or at least  they should have given him a monster face or something when he finally geared up for battle. 

Speaking of which, let's talk about the final battle. The pacing yes was a little rushed.  I feel like they kind of ran out of time. But as to the complaints about it turning into a generic superhero fight?  Well yeah, what did you think you were watching?  Of COURSE there would be a final showdown between her and Ares.  She was planning it through the entire movie! Also, have you read comic books?  This is how it goes. 

My biggest complaint?  If they were going to set up a ""only love defeats war"" thing, they could have spent a little more time building
up that idea instead of just dropping it on us. 

All in all, I was really impressed.  I give it a 8/10 for comic book films.  ",6erigc

I don't need 45 minutes of child Diana and what Chris Pine was doing before he crashed on the island. That's just padding run time with thinly veiled expository dialogue.

Middle third of the movie was the best part and honestly a decent movie. Some good fish out of water jokes, an interesting premise with a war movie following a little rag tag commando unit, but one of them happens to be a super hero. If the movie was more of that, it would be a better movie.

Then the last fight scene and resolution was like every other shitty dc movie. Full of shirty cgi, needless slow-no, no tension or sense of gravity despite the untold destruction going on all around the fighters. And ""I believe in love"" is seriously cringe worthy.

Judged on its own merits, probably a C+ movie, but grading on the DC curve, that's like an A-",6erigc

The editing is really great. When Trevor's plane explodes, the shift in music and the cut to Diana's reaction was *perfectly* done. Explosive moments really feel explosive.

Pine and Gadot are very good at their craft, I was specifically impressed with Pine, especially with the shift in his scene with Doctor Poison.

CGI was bad near the end. I'm just gonna come out and say it. It looked like PS4 cinematics. It was a little jarring, even if it did look cool. I hope the trend with these DC films isn't to have a really gross CGI villain, cause that's been the case for 3 in a row. The actual choreography of the fight scenes was great though, or at least entertaining.

During the beginning of the movie I was a little miffed at the implication that Ares started World War I. I thought that was really disrespectful to the people who fought in it. Later on, when Trevor's like ""no, people start wars"" I was glad, but then they take this weird middle route with it? Like Ares inspired people to invent the weapons? It still feels wrong to me. Like what if someone made a movie where the villain has mind control and ""caused"" 9/11 by controlling the hijackers? It'd be weird right?",6erigc

Major points of contention:

* The villains had ZERO character development, I wouldn't even call them characters. They were props. By the end of the movie, I knew about as much about them as I did at the start.This felt especially weird for Dr. Poison, because they kept showing her but not revealing anything new about her to the viewer when they did. (Is she a villain from the comics, and she's just in the movie for the wink?)

* Wonder Woman's assembled cast had barely any development. Their characters nearly ended where they began. (Also, the secretary lady got way too little screen time--pretty sure this feminist paragon of a movie doesn't pass the Bechdel test).

* The ending with the face off with Aries was stupid and unsubtle. They were building him up to be a mastermind ""Loki""/Lucifer-type character, but he was ultimately undone by a hissy-fit and a gorilla battle with Wonder Woman.

All I'm seeing for this movie is showers of praise, but heck even Guardians 2 seems better put together... Is this some kind of DC fanboy surge? A feminist thing? It's unclear to me.

I didn't really feel like Ares was a dangerous villain at all, so it didn't even feel like WW saved the day. Rather, the whole movie builds up to the Germans dropping the gas which would kill millions. Chris Pine felt like more of a hero for blowing up the plane.

The villain was your typical marvel villain, Ares looked ridiculous and the ending fight was lame, I prefer when they keep the action grounded but it did get a little silly.

I really liked the scenes where Wonder Woman was just Diana Prince, and interacted with the world and the people around her.There was one particular scene where Diana is taught how to dance by Steve Trevor, and she innocently replies that it's not dancing it's ""swaying"" that I found very endearing. But the second that Diana turned into Wonder Woman I mentally checked out because of the gimmicky over use of slow motion, and a very uncanny valley CGI. It was as though I was watching an action set piece ripped straight out of Hulk (2003). I especially hated the final battle with Ares as It left me feeling as though I was watching BvS again. And, this may just be a nitpick but why was Wonder Woman able to use the force at the end? To my knowledge that wasn't a power she used in the fight against doomsday. I felt as though the action scenes where very poorly done and it really took away from my overall enjoyment of the film.

dig3jm4,"Overall I thought it was pretty decent. Not exactly mind-blowing, but I liked it well enough.

Some thoughts: Though the director recently stated that there were no cut scenes, I couldn't help feel it lacked some connective tissue. There were a number of scenes that had me wondering how characters got from point A to point B so fast, or how so-and-so just happened to appear at location X. Things like that. That's not a big deal when it happens occasionally in a film, but it happened enough here that it became remarkable. 

Though set in WWI, the film doesn't shy away from anachronistically dropping lots of little post-modern critiques. That didn't bother me too much since the film never gets too preachy, but it sort of robbed the film of the one area I thought the writers could have justifiably spent more time on; An Amazon from a matriarchal society clashing with a post-Edwardian patriarchal society. We do get some of that, but I felt the film could have spent a bit more time exploring the issue rather than some of the other social issues the writers apparently thought were just as important to discuss.

My main issue with the film has to do with some of the dialogue. There are a number of key scenes in the film where the characters are attempting to say something important to one another...some moving or philosophically profound speech that's supposed to mark character growth and insight, but the dialogue never moves past what a 14 year old might think sounds deep. Zack Snyder is the film's writer, and he's struggled with this sort of dialogue in his previous films (particularly Sucker Punch). So I don't know if the fault lies primarily with him or what, but...it bugged me. 

Like Snyder's other DC films, Man of Steel, and Batman V Superman, this film oddly dovetails a lot of Christian symbolism into the final product. Here that symbolism is shrouded under Greek myth, but the parallels are rather obvious when you see it: 1.) In the film we're told that Zeus is the father of the gods, and that one of his sons, Ares, the god of war, rebels. There's a war between the gods, and Ares is ultimately cast out of Olympus by Zeus. I thought I knew my Greek mythology pretty well, but I don't remember this particular tale, however, it does seem to parallel the Bible's imagery of Satan's rebellion, the war between the angels, and Satan being cast out of the heavenly realm. 2.) [Major Spoilers ahead] Like Christian views of Satan, Ares doesn't manifest and direct evil personally in the world, rather, he does so surreptitiously by influencing humans to do the evil that's already in their heart. 3.) There's a scene where Wonder Woman is tempted by Ares. In a vision, Ares tells her that if she submits and joins him, the world will become a utopia. I think this is supposed to be an allusion to Jesus' temptation by Satan in the wilderness when Satan offers Jesus the kingdoms of the world. 4.) We learn that Wonder Woman IS the god killer of this world, and this would seem to parallel John 12:31/2 Cor. 4:4 where Jesus is the one who overcomes the god/prince of this world. I don't know why Snyder adds all of this Christian symbolism throughout his DC films. I have a sneaking suspicion it's not because he's a Christian, but because he thinks it elevates what's mostly just silly popcorn movie nonsense into the realm of something artsy and awe inspiring. As though film critics are going to pour through is works in the future and be mind-blown by how rich his films are. I think it comes off a little forced, personally, but whatever.

The two things I liked most about the film is the casting of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, and the theme we hear any time she ramps into action. Gadot is getting lots of guff from the comic nerd community for not being Wonder Woman enough. I don't really get that. I'm not sure if they're wanting some sort of female bodybuilder, or what, but I think she's pretty perfect. She's Israeli, so she at least looks and sounds realistically Mediterranean, which is what you'd want with a Greek Amazonian (and is more than I can say for the rest of the Amazons in the cast, which looked anything but Mediterranean), and she's a very decent actress. And the musical score that accompanies her action gets ya so pumped. It wasn't over used in the film, which is good, but I do wish it was integrated into the rest of the score a bit better.

So yeah, I think that's all I wanted to say about this movie. Overall, I got nitpicks, but it was a good film. I'd recommend it for people who like this sort of thing.",6erigc
dii33na,"This was a solid movie, but it wasn't better than Man of Steel (and that was a solid film.)

They really missed the boat on the ending. Ares [should've been revealed as Steve Trevor (Trevor Steve?). He could have explained to WW that, even though he is the god of war, he's horrified by the slaughter of the first world war and fears even more brutal destruction to come. His efforts during the film have been to end the war before it gets worse. He could have also explained to Diana that killing him won't end the war; it works in the reverse. Once all war ends, he will die. His fate is bound to the eternal conflict that haunts humanity. The film could've ended with the armistice and Ares/Steve would've gone into a hibernation.](#spoiler)

dietdsw,"I think the movie was decent, but I hoped for a lot more. The highlight of the movie was the chemistry between Diana and Steve for sure. That is where the character development was super strong, but in terms for everyone else, the rest of them were flat. Steve's companions were just super expendable and I think they tried to add some stuff like how the sniper had PTSD but it just felt so shallow to me. And then in terms of the villains it was even more bland because there was nothing remotely special about them. In terms of Ares, he was really just an idea until the last 20 minutes of the movie which made me unattached to the fight sequence. The comedy in the movie was pretty good, perhaps a little forced in first half but it was well blended in the dialogue in the second half. I enjoyed some of the action, but I think I was just looking for more of it to really showcase her skill. The No Mans Land sequence was excellent and I wanted another scene of that caliber, but the last fight with Ares just didn't do that for me.

dijrd3d,"Its kind of strange that I'm watching a film where the hero kills 18 year old conscripts. For that I do admire the courage of choosing too set WW1 in WWI. Its easy too fuck up a WWI film as it was a giant cluster fuck of a war where its true that it was mainly the central powers doing bad things, such as mustard gas and the Armenian genocide, but the war still remains greyer than WWII, much greyer. 

The film actually manages too handle this very well and is the most surprising thing. These Synder-verse DC film so far haven't been very smart. 

Gal Gaddot actually does a decent job at acting despite being very stale in Batman V Superman, although I put that down too bad direction personally. 

Chris Pine is great and likeable, the only thing about him that made the film a bit odd was that he was an American. The yanks had only just arrived in the war, even by November of 1918 most didn't see combat. Its very unlikely that the British at the time would have trusted an American spy. In WWII yes but WWI, nope. I was expecting them to make him a Canadian like they did in Allied. Its not so much of a complaint but more of a gripe personally. 

Overall the film is good, a 7/10. Negatives include bad GCI and the fight scenes are the worst moments in the film by far and its clear that the directer was fighting with Snyder with this. But the film makes up for it with human characters who are likeable and you do ultimately want them too succeed. 

The film is still going for the DC 'darkverse' style but a WWI setting is perfect for this, and this film executes its well. I hope that future DC films take note from wonder woman, it manages too be dark whilst still having humanity, likeable characters and a by the numbers plot that still manages too steal you away. 

Its also paced very well, every other DC film - post man of steel - has been paced poorly but this film, is actually paced very well. 

Dare I say it, its what Man of steel should have been, but without the fight at the end

When I did martial arts in high school -- ITF Taekwondo -- a lot of complicated kicks and moves were taught that I couldn't do  because I just never had that degree of coordination in my legs. To me a roundhouse kick is a kick to the torso, lol. Althought that was still very effective against bullies, which was the purpose of me learning it. :) 

But some people are really good at that kind of stuff, those acrobatic moves. It doesn't necessarily mean CGI was used. 

Now where they have Wonder Woman flying through the air, some of that is CGI, although the indoor scenes were probably done with a wire. But there are a lot of physical stunts in the movie too.

* Exactly how did the German’s follow Trevor’s plane to Themyscira?

* It’s nice that the film’s only nudity is of Chris Pine.

* One of Trevor’s happy band of mercs is your clichéd broken soldier.

* The change from World War II to the First World War did not bother my comic nerd brain.

* Danny Huston is basically playing a Teutonic version of his villainous character from X-Men Origins: Wolverine.

* The CGI boss fight at the end of the movie was the film's only real failure.

* Just what has Diana been doing during all those years between this movie and her showing up to help fight Doomsday?

didcrss,"I loved the movie! I mean, with the exception of Suicide Squad, I've loved the DCEU so far so I wasn't that surprised but still what a fantastic experience! This is what a superhero flick should be about: heart, heroism, wonder and tragedy.

Also, I'm probably very gullible but I didn't see the Ares twist coming at all! It makes a lot of sense though.

I read one of the recent Wonder Woman comic series for a glimpse of her origin and one thing I felt they should've added was the fact that she was such a compassionate and good hearted nurse. But that might've stretched the movie too much.

I expected male characters to be an afterthought, but I'm surprised at how fleshed out Steve Trevor was! He was a good character period, as was the entire supporting cast from heroes to villains.

I'm definitely going back for a weekday screening though to watch at a relatively empty hall. Today was jampacked and whispers abounded.",6erigc
die4i11,"This movie was awesome!! 9 or 9.5/10 for sure.

First let me say, I go to movies to have fun, but we are here to be critical right!! 

So after the crap that was Superman Vs Batman (I still like it had fun but it was a bad movie...). I wasn't expecting much out of this film, I just hoped it would be better.

As the hype train got going, I ignored it, I didn't watch many trailers, didn't read any reviews.

This movie was fannnntassticc. 

First of all, we had a woman lead character who not once, gave up her position of power to a man in the film. I hate when we have a strong female lead character, who all of a sudden turns into a wimp who can't do anything anymore. (divergents lead comes to mind). 

I LOVE the way they setup the movie. A quick 5 second introduction that brings us back to where we were in Batman Vs Superman, but the rest of the movie is all about her origin story!!

I thought they would touch on her origin story and keep it in the recent years, but no, the WHOLE MOVIE was her origin story!!! I only knew a bit of it going into the movie and wow what an awesome story.

Honestly, every supporting actor did a great job, but thats what they were, supporting characters. No one was fighting for attention, they didn't sacrifice anything important for their parts, the focus was on Diana through and through and everyone was along for the ride.

They didn't try to add any importance to the secondary characters. This was so key!!! How many marvel movies, or suicide squad or other movies where they give some character no one gives a dam about, some important moment for no reason. The secondary characters end up fighting for attention and pulling it away from the character everyone is there to see.

Next, the fight scenes. Omgod the fight scenes. Some of the CG was AWFUL when it came to her fighting, so so obvious I dont know how it got through to production. However her fight scenes felt ""real"" for the majority of the movie. I felt like Diana had struggles during fighting, she faced obstacles, she wasn't perfect but she was on her own level anyways. She obviously was never fighting at true trained Wonder Woman, she was fighting as a recruit/fresh Wonder Woman.

She had to adapt to new weaponry and landscapes, she had trouble with all levels, like fighting the soldiers, she got pinned down by the turret, she then lost her weaponry in the room she barges into, she lost her shield in the town centre. The only point where I questioned the fighting was when she was held down by the turret and her legs and lower torso were exposed. She would have been shot there, but every other scene, it felt like she blocked everything or dealt with everything, nothing felt like it was skipped over.

The god fight scene. This was also incredible. I'm thinking of the recent guardians of the galaxy 2 god fight, or batman vs superman fight, or the final boss in batman vs superman. Unlike the aforementioned movies, this god fight felt great. The boss didn't look, or feel at any point unkillable. Why should he? Diana is a god as well. Unfortunately, he shouldn't have really been killed off here. He just teleported from London to the battlefield.. pretty sure he could just leave when things looked bad lol.

Incredible movie. Highly recommend.

I wish they would have spent a little more time on Themiscryra and fleshed out her relationships with her fellow amazons a bit more, as well as fleshed out her training.  I recall watching an animated origin story for Wonder Woman a long time ago and I liked how they had her in some cultural event or competition with her fellow Amazons in that.  It really showed her capabilities and skills in a better context before she took off to the world of man and it took a closer look at the culture and society of the Amazons as well.

The fish out of water scenes were good, I kind of wish there were more interactions like that with every day people like Etta. The first two acts kept me interested and by far the best scene in the movie was the no man's land scene and subsequent character moments in the town and woods.  The third act turned into the basic DCEU CGI clusterfuck though.  As a Fargo viewer watching the bulimic bad guy with bad teeth from this season don CGI muscles and God of War armor was hilarious.

I think the story behind [did Ares start the war or was it human's nature for conflict that started the war](#spoiler) was great in my books [though the ending was pretty cheesy with all of them buddy-buddy with each other](#spoiler).

I agree with everyone here that they did not really mention the line ""Wonder Woman"" anywhere at the end of a phrase, EVEN though they had plenty of opportunities to do so. 

[Was very sad to see Pine eat the dust, thought he would grab a parachute from the pilot or something. But his death is more meaningful than if he survived.

What were they thinking having Ares and Diana quite literally chuck pieces of metal each other's heads for almost 30 minutes in a poorly lit action sequence where you can barely even make out David Thewlis' CGI armor, and further dragged out by the corniest dialogue possible?

The animated film had a way better third that would've been great if it was included in this film, especially to bring a conclusion to the Amazons that were left without closure.",6erigc
didh5od,"I, for once, thought the movie was pretty underwhelming. 

The movie certainly wasn't all bad. Chris Pine's charisma and comedic timing got a few chuckles out of me and when the action really got going I was having a blast. But it's when the movie tries being serious that it really falls apart. 

One of the prime exemple of this is the amazon arc AKA the opening arc. I hate  everything about it.  It's long, boring, melodramatic, cliche and cheesy. Furthermore,  it's really not that essential to the story  since you don't even encounter any of the characters that are introduced during that arc later on, not that you'd want to anyway. I'd rather watch Ares turn into a cartoon villain again than listen to more amazonian soap opera.   

Side note: I also found it weird and distracting how skimpy the amazonian armors were. It was almost MMORPG fantasy armor tier. Why wear plate armor when you can slap on a leather tank-top.  
 
I also remain entirely unconvinced by Gal Gadot as an actress. She's perfectly capable of playing the innocent and naive fish out of water and for what's it's worth, had good chemistry with Chris Pine for the light-hearted moments but fell flat when it came to showing more emotions. Her attempts at crying literally had me cringing.  

I must admit that the action scenes were pretty entertaining though. Especially the one in No man's land. There's something about DC's action scene that really sets them a part from marvel. It's more brutal and you really do feel the weight of every blow.   It's like DC decided that all their fights should feel like Hulk vs the Hulkbuster suit. 

As for Ares, he was a pretty intimidating presence for the short amount of time he was on screen. That is until he decided to whip out his list of cheesy supervillain lines towards the climax.


In the end, Wonder Woman is a better movie than suicide Squad but it really wasn't DC's savior as many try to make it out to be. At least in my opinion. 


",6erigc
digkgkx,"Saw the movie last night and honestly it wasn't as good as all the reviews and some people on this thread are making it out to be. I don't know maybe it's because this is the first female led superhero movie of the decade and so people really want to like it and are hesitant to criticize it so that they don't discourage studios from making more female led action movies.

&nbsp;

Overall though, this was a pretty generic movie and the action was just ok, they used a little too much slow mo and the CGI seemed out of place at some parts. As for the cast, it was pretty underwhelming in my opinion, with the expectation of Chris Pine. Personally the cast, of characters and actors, seemed to be something that a lower production movie would have grabbed. Like you've got some generic soldiers of fortune with a heart of gold that join Wonder Woman, who we're supposed to like and trust immediately. Captain America: The First Avenger had a similar plot point but the actors they had cast just had more presence and we got a bit more time with them, I don't know it's hard to describe. Then you've got the [guy who plays Ares. He just didn't fit the bill physically. Like why not just add some minor shape shifting to his powers, and that way have it so he was only using the mustache guy look as a temporary form to blend in and influence the Allied forces directly? No offense to the actor, but it was hard to take him seriously as a threat. I predicted the twist with Ares before hand too so maybe that impacted my experience as well.](#spoiler)

&nbsp;

And for me, unfortunately, Gal still didn't play a convincing Wonder Woman. Don't get me wrong, she does the action scenes really well, but it's the rest of the act that seems lacking to me. As Diana there are some parts where she get the excitement of experiencing a new land and culture just right, but there are plenty of other parts where it seems like she's overacting. As Wonder Woman, she just lacks this presence that I feel she should have. And the delivery of her lines, like the ""I'm Diana of Themyscira..."" just didn't have the power or conviction behind it that lines like that need. I really was hoping she'd do a good job but I just wasn't sold, and her being paired with Chris Pine, who was all charisma as Steve Trevor, only served to highlight her weakness. There were just various aspects of this film that felt ""off"" to me if anyone else can relate, that keeps this from being a great action movie. And the aesthetic of this was the same as the other DC movies which I'm not a fan of, but at least they finally got some color in one of their heroes costume.

&nbsp;

TL;DR Overall, this is an ok film that I feel is being over hyped. It's a pretty generic action film but it's one of the best that DC's offered so far, though that's not saying much. For comparison, it's like a combination of the first Thor and Captain America movies, but not necessarily of their best parts.

I'm gonna help 'em anyway."" Because it's not about deserving. It's about believing in a thing called love. Which is cheesy, but Patty Jenkins doesn't believe in the word ""cheesy."" And look what happens when you remove the word ""cheesy"" from your vocabulary. You make a pretty damn solid Superman movie. 

&nbsp; 

However, the current Rotten Tomatoes score is a little high. People are talking about this, saying it's the best superhero movie in the last 10 years. In order to be that, Wonder Woman needs to set some trend or change some game. Like how the Dark Knight Trilogy reinvented the Batman mythos. Or how Guardians of the Galaxy made funky classic rock viable for superhero movies. Also, Wonder Woman had no ""Wow"" moment. As in, a scene that was memorable and I would rewatch on YouTube. Civil War had the Airport Scene. Dr. Strange had the Dormammu Scene. Rogue One had the Hallway Scene. I guess Wonder Woman's might be the Veld Scene? That's the closest thing I can come to.

Also, the sidekicks and sex jokes were annoying, and the romantic subplot was a little unfitting? But on the other hand, the romantic subplot was necessary, because it's Diana's MacGuffin. The movie is about how love is the thing that pushes humans to listen to the good side of themselves. If Wonder Woman did change a game, I guess you could say it managed to pull off a cheesy message like this. I believed, maaaaaan...",6erigc
die9nis,"It was pretty good, but I think that its being a bit overrated at the moment.

The movie feels incredibly safe, but that's probably what DC and Warner Bros. needed out of it.  Chris Pine (who I'm usually not a big fan of) and Gal Gadot had good chemistry though and I enjoyed their interactions.  

My biggest criticism is with the actions scenes. They were filled with terrible CGI and the overuse of slow-mo was grating.  Oh, and I loathed their portrayal of Germany and wish they would have done more with setting the movie in the closing days of WWI.  The first world war is one of the great tragedies in human history, and is a lesson in pointless and futile conflicts.

dicr6r3,"After seeing it today here's my thoughts.

The good:

1. It was like Captain America but it felt real, there was clearly someone passionate behind the camera. When Joe Johnston was in line to make Captain America I was super excited because he's someone who has proven he can make period pieces look real, instead it looked completely fake. It told The First Avenger better than The First Avenger did.

2. There is finally a hopeful character in DC instead of a bunch mopey, brooding douchebags.

3. I really do love that we get Wonder Woman as a role model for little
Girls. I'm normally against the idea that only ladies can empathise with ladies and men with men, but this still is the first woman superhero movie in the new age of comics and it will be great for kids.

The bad:

1.  The third act was complete ass. It's like they were restraining all the bad dialogue, acting and special effects just to let it go at the end. I liked the message it was trying to send but did Ares really try and goad Wonder Woman into striking down Captain Poison with all of her anger so she could join the dark side?

2. What was Wonder Woman? Was she smart or dumb? She knew a lot of things one second, like chemistry and what photographs were but she didn't know a lot of other shit... Literally every situation you had to guess as to whether she would be smart or dumb.

3. Chris Pine bosses and pushes her about the whole fucking movie. Like literally up until the end of the second act. When he's trying to move her out of British generals room I wanted her to be like 'I like you but if you budge me one more time I will break you'... It was complete bullshit. 

4. So many weird moments... When Wonder Woman defeated her trainer and then everyone's mad at her including herself... What the fuck was that about? 'Sorry guys...I'm just too good at fighting.' That's a bad thing? 

5. What the fuck was with that awkward boat scene where they're just talking about banging? Why was Wonder Woman's arc about discovering that dick is worth fighting for?

6. although it was a better Captain America than Captain America... It was still annoying how similar it was.

It was a film that started of amazing and slowly became ass.",6erigc
dictyty,"It was OK but it was nothing special.

The CGI was pretty bad, the final fight was the most generic thing I've ever seen, the sub villains were comically evil (they throw super mustard gas into a room, the German officer throws in a gas mask, Dr Poison says 'that won't help,' the German officer says 'they don't know that!' Then they literally giggle.), I really hate what they did with the gods and I don't like the fact that Zeus created the Amazons.

My mother is so very happy and she feels so great about it to finally have a woman superhero. I know people have complained about Star Wars, but she was mentioning how happy she was for Star Wars to begin including female characters as the main characters, and seeing how happy this film made her made me happy as well.

Also her character behaves like a naive teenager. Parts of the fighting scenes are cringeworthy. At least there was comedic relief here and there, along with some entertaining scenes where sexual innuendo was probably not intended. In a nutshell, I wish I had spent my money on something else.

dih1esb,"I'm going to be completely honest here. I really didn't feel like this was much better than anything else DC has done. It was equally meandering, cliche, and hilarious corny almost all the way through. The CG was more colorful this time, but also pretty sub-par during many of the scenes. Especially the overblown finale that was genuinely painful to sit through. I felt bad for laughing, but I did, during plenty of the scenes that weren't really focused on actual comedy. 

This is sad because after the glowing reviews I was expecting something a bit better than BvS. It is better than suicide Squad, but not that much.

_________

I think this film really struggles in a lot of areas when it comes to pacing as well as logistics. War was a complete joke of a setting and never felt grand or life-threatening. The themes were also totally at war with each other. 

""Diana, war isn't simple! You can't just kill the biggest bad guy and everyone is broken from a spell!"" Chris Evans' character shouts right before Diana kills the god of war and every German soldier takes off their evil masks and begins smiling at the sunset. 

Okay.

""There is good in every man, and I will bring it out of them!"" Diana bellows as she charges past a German guard and guts him with her sword. 

Okay. 

_________

It is the small things, too. How come her wrist guards magically grew as she aged? Wouldn't that be a big fucking hint to her that she's pretty magical? 

Overall, Diana was a frustrating character because she was totally ruled by illogic. Watching someone with the power to save the world run around spouting nonsequitars about Ares and gods, get treated to the pg-13 brutality of war, and then still be right about her moralizing cheapens war to the point of absurdity. 

Very disappointed in this flick. What's more saddening is I know they'll be trying to imitate it from now on since critics and audiences adore it so I'm in store for more of the same shlock. I really don't understand how people enjoyed this any more than they did BvS and the first Superman. ",6erigc

""my God, Gal Gadot is hot"", which means, I wasn't really impressed by the story, special effects etc. The story had potential, and for the most part, I kind a liked it, some dialogues were great, characters were compelling, like the Trevors mercs and dr. Poison. The main reason I went to watch Wonder Woman in theatre, was the setting. I thought they can use the WW1 setting really well. Yes they showed the tragedy, they showed hell, they showed suffering civilians, they showed nature of humans in trenches, but it was all heavily watered down.

I'm sure there will be plenty of people who disliked the film and that's fair enough and yes the final act was quite comic booky and fairly generic but when two god's fight each other it's generally going to end that way and for me it's no deal breaker.

dicqzoy,"Wonder Woman isn't reinventing the wheel when it comes to super hero movies – if you're expecting that, you'll be disappointed – but it brings a decidedly fresh take, thanks to the performances of an eclectic supporting cast, and the magnificent and stunning Gal Gadot.

We start in a utopia that is essentially a small slice of Olympus hidden on earth. Throughout the movie, we see Diana struggle to come to terms with the dichotomy between the world she grew up in, and the world of men. She is infectiously optimistic and altruistic, but as her world fades from black and white to shades of grey, she struggles to balance that drive to help people with the pain and suffering she encounters first hand.

You can't help but fall in love with Diana, she is breathtakingly gorgeous, and brings an exceptional degree of authenticity to an ""inhuman"" role. Some of her facial expressions and exchanges with Steve (Chris Pine) are so genuine you can't help but smile at their on-screen chemistry. 

Steve makes an excellent partner for Diana, as he is the logic and reason to Diana's passion and emotion. The bathhouse scene is the perfect mix of comedy and awkwardness, and you can't help but grin from ear to ear at his delivery of ""above average"". 

The movie relies heavily on CGI for almost all of the major sequences, which is appropriate for the subject matter, but feels unnecessary at times. Steve, Diana, Charlie, Sameer, and the Chief bring so much charisma and charm to the movie that I wish we had more screen time to see them develop. The German pub scene is wonderful and unexpected.

One of the underlying themes of the movie is man's propensity to violence, and the cost that violence inflicts on the world. At the end of the movie, love is suggested as the balancing element to the violence that at times seems so prevalent. I found that poignantly relevant in the context of the world today, and while it's by no means a groundbreaking assertion, it gave me pause to consider what needs to be done to make our world a better place. I give the filmmakers credit for hitting on that note without striking an overtly quixotic tone.

As a final note, I'm thrilled to see Gal Gadot cast in a leading role. I thought she was fantastic as Gisele in the Fast and Furious movies, and I'm thrilled to see her succeed so exceptionally in Wonder Woman.",6erigc

The humor was effective. It didnt feel forced but rather natural. Love is kind of a central point in the movie at least for me it was. And its easy to get cheesy with the romance in these kind of movies but here it was really effective.

The movie has some pacing issues in the middle but nothing major. The direction and cinematography were good. The action for the most part was good but the final battle gets drowned by the overuse of CGI.

The film manages to balance showing the horror of war with a fun blockbuster excellently by having a protagonist that embodies goodness and hope,in a way that I don't think any of the new DC have managed up to this point. Diana's arc is well realised and really manages to ground the film. I especially enjoyed that it's not afraid to take its time and actually develop Diana and Themyscira, giving us reason to care and be invested in what happens.

If I have a gripe it's that the twist involving Ares and Diana's backstory, while forshadowed well, is the least interesting part of the film. The final showdown is fine enough and while it's fun to see Thewlis play such a delightfully evil, it suffers from a similar problem to Iron Man's climax, whereby it's just the least involving part of the film. I also think it's a little flimsy that Diana can't return to Themyscira when seemingly anyone can just stumble upon it.

I didnt care for the villains the Dr. Poison reminded me of Scarecrow in Batman Begins but she didn't feel like a serious threat (imo) even though it was her invention was the main plot point in the end she was just a lackey, the huffing general was kinda weird felt forced in that the gas was thown in so he could stand a chance against wonder woman, also why aren't they using it on all their soldiers. Lastly Ares felt tacked on I like were they were going with the reveal (to WW) that he's not really responsible for the war and he's just been letting us do our thing but it fell flat for me. Gal Tarot was great so hopefully this quiets the naysayers, none of the supporting cast really stood out for me the three friends of Steve were ok but felt underdeveloped, Chris Pine was great wish he was playing Hal Jordan  so we could see him more.

Finally, I really enjoyed the final battle. I know a lot of people have a problem with it but it is pure Wonder Woman comic fun. The movie was building to something like that since the beginning. It's a fight between two gods, of course there is going to be a lot of CG. ",6erigc
digctwu,"Saw this yesterday and I loved it. Loved every single minute of it. What makes it better is that I didn't expect to love it this much. I went in excited but nervous but this exceeded my expectations.

I adored Gal Gadot here. She gets everything about her character down to a tee, from her naivete to her compassion to her strength, and she completely embodies the role. She is Wonder Woman. She shines a lot during the action sequences but I also thought she was fantastic during the more dramatic parts and even better during the more comedic parts. I didn't expect the film to be this funny. Her comedic timing is spot-on and I loved her relationship with Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). Pine and Gadot have wonderful chemistry with one another so you really buy the bond they end up sharing with one another and get invested in their interactions. Their relationship really adds a lot of heart to the film. I loved the part where Pine teaches her how to eat ice cream.

Patty Jenkins directs the hell out of this film. You can tell she's really passionate about the character and the DC universe and it shows in how she directs the film. She presents a superhero film that's full of hope, heart, and optimism yet isn't afraid to be serious, even dark, when it needs to be. Very beautiful-looking film too with gorgeous cinematography and visuals. The effects admittedly aren't perfect, but the film was so good that that aspect didn't completely take me out of it and a lot of them are quite dazzling. The action sequences are all memorable and exciting. I won't be surprised if the No Man's Land sequence will later go down in history as one of the all-time great CBM set pieces.

Even the villains I found myself enjoying. Danny Huston was awesome as Ludendorff and you can tell he was having the time of his life playing him. Ares' reveal I felt was very well-thought out. My favorite, however, has to be Doctor Poison honestly. Elena Anaya does a great job playing her and she's also the most interesting of these villains. Yes, this is a film with three villains and yet it handles all of them very well and it helps that they're all connected to the story and don't feel random or tacked-on.

I was so happy to see this turn out so well. Very much looking forward to the sequel, especially with Jenkins coming back, and I hope this paves the way for female-directed summer blockbusters and superhero films to come. The champion of the DCEU and one of my new favorite comic book films.",6erigc

Diana and Steve were good - Chris Pine did a fantastic job - but the supporting characters were quite shallowly drawn, and really disappointingly for a DC movie the villains were pretty poor and barely given any motivation/characterisation above 'evil'. (Coming straight after Suicide Squad's bland dancing witch, I hope this isn't a new trend.) 

Most of the action sequences were cool, but the end battle was a bit messy with the CG and definitely had a few too many close ups of Gal face as she ran towards the camera when it felt like we should have been at mid-shot or further back to give more sense of the fight.

Overall, good but not great movie which could have done with being ten minutes shorter.",6erigc
difpwb1,"This movie has structural issues, like most superhero movies have. There was a bit of a lull in pacing around the 100 minute mark, and I thought Chris Pine was kind of a jackass (I wanted to reach through the screen every time he yelled ""Diana!""). There was way too much slow motion flipping around in the first act. Supporting characters got shafted on development.  

That said, I really enjoyed it otherwise. This is a very effective, impactful movie with plenty of great moments. My favorite is probably WW stepping out of the trench and advancing on the Germans, which was incredibly badass and even bordered on emotional. It's very well shot, most of the action is really cool, and I loved how they handled the final conversation between WW and Steve, with her ringing ears preventing her from hearing him, but knowing what he said when she thought back to him. 

The moment David Thewlis was on screen, I thought ""there no way they cast Thewlis without the intention of making him a secret bad guy."" Turns out I was right, but I wasn't expecting the Ares reveal and their conversation in the watch tower was great. ",6erigc

By the end, I couldn't wait for it to end as the dramatic fight, full of sacrifices and endless motivational speeches, was way too long.

Overall, the movie is only worth one time watching.",6erigc

I thought that there must've been some mistake that this movie was reviewed almost as high as The Dark Knight, but it looks like I'm one of the only ones who didn't like this movie. Can someone explain why they liked the movie so much? I must be missing something. ",6erigc
digr8nf,"Just saw it today. Was hesitant going in, but it turned out alright. An entertaining superhero origins movie that we've seen a thousand times before. But we seem to like them! Worth a watch if you're into the DC universe. Hopefully they can build on this.

The good: Chris Pine really played his part well; nailed some comedic relief and delivered some of the expected corny, idealistic dialogue with enough sincerity to make me forgive it. The action sequence from the trench warfare to saving the village is pretty well shot/edited/choreographed.  

The meh: Gal Gadot looks the part, but as an actress she was pretty weak. Story was nothing to write home about, and the antagonists weren't compelling. Again, the movie is pretty standard. [David Thewlis as Ares had me a little quizzical. Decent twist, but not the most convincing persona for a god of war.](#spoiler) Far from a masterpiece of cinema or even a superhero classic. The 2001 Spiderman and the Nolan Batman movies far outclass this one.

So overall, yeah it's entertaining, but I feel it's getting a little undue praise for sociopolitical reasons most likely (92% of the reviews are positive because one must signal that they are in favor of female superhero movies). I think the Metacritic score is on the nose. I'd give  it 6.5-7.5 out of 10; finally a good movie under the Warner Bros./DC belt. Hopefully DC can build on this to keep pace with Marvel, but they *need* to find a new Joker for future Batman films.",6erigc

Gal Gadot is perfect as Wonder Woman, but I hate how all the finale fights in the DC movies always end up being some CGI shitfest mess. Of course they're gods and all but I guess maybe these types of movies ain't for me.

The actor/character playing Ares didn't fit with that mustache it really turned me off HAHA they could have at least covered it with the mask or something, it was really distracting. There were way too many slow motion shots which took me out of the film, way too overly dramatic. I felt kinda dumb watching her ice-skate those Germans when Chris Pine's character died.

The side characters felt so underused as well, the Marksmen never shoots his gun and only uses it as binoculars to scout from afar, the native American dude seems to do nothing throughout the whole film and the French dude was there for the laughs, I felt like the character of Steve could have done all 3 of those roles on his own..

The B villains were kinda just there at times, but they managed to give them some depth as well. I really enjoyed the lightheartedness scenes so much, it made us love her character even more. Before watching I had read interviews saying how love will be a defining theme in the movie and while I thought it was cliche at first, this film managed to use that so well and not make it that.

- The three other members of their team were complete throwaway characters.

dij6yrq,"Scrolling through tens of the top rated comments here and there is nothing but praise, so I'm not sure my criticisms will be well received at all.



Firstly, the casting is perfect. Solid performances all around.


My main criticisms stem from it feeling a bit heavy handed. Its great to have a strong female lead, and is a refreshing change. For example in all scenes there looked to be some colour correction -
 they made her skin glow and colours she wore vibrant while muting others skin and clothes. I know she is a demigod but it was so heavily done that it spoiled the immersion for me. If they scaled it back it could have achieved the same thing with more subtlety. 


I had more than slight suspicions about the [two reveals, possibly due to struggling with immersion.  She was the weapon based on withholding of information about her on the island, and person = weapon isn't a new trope. Ludendorff red herring was a bit more obvious, especially with Sir Patrick standing out in contrast to the era appropriate sexist military men. I was suspicious of Sir Patrick because he went against what the bigoted Generals wanted, which is peace. In addition, he was one of the least likely supporting cast members (manners and appearance) to be Ares, he also used a cane IIRC and we were told Ares was injured - and therefore the most likely.](#spoiler) However, an obvious plot doesn't really ruin a superhero movie as thats not the primary point. 

The set pieces and slow-mo and perfect hair flicks where exactly what you'd expect from a super hero movie but found them, in addition to overly emotional scores, to be used too frequently and got the opposite reaction from me than intended. 


I enjoyed the movie far more than other recent super hero outings, but went in with possibly unfair expectations. I'd heard so much hype about how it challenged the genre but only found it only to switch main and supporting genders. I struggled with immersion and a lack of subtlety and therefore was able to guess the main plot points from the breadcrumbs provided. Most of these criticisms stem from me as a viewer and my expectations, so I'd probably raise my rating from 6 to 7/10 taking this into account.




e: Does anyone else have a slight concern that this may end similar to Ghostbusters remake, wherein any professional critic who does not like the movie for various reasons will be labelled misogynistic and lumped in with those that do no like it for purely sexist reasons. ",6erigc

dicj60o,"I didn't really dislike this movie, but it was rather disappointing. The humor was overdone at points and certain parts dragged on for too long. 

The No Man's Land scene, however, was great, as were the performances of Gadot and Pine. 

The big reveals were kinda predictable and a little on the cliche side. The film's climax wasn't ideal.

I think the big problem was how the whole thing felt really disjointed. I don't want to have to compare it to Marvel, but this movie really shows how much D.C. Would like to be Marvel but they just can't figure out what makes them work. Someone says ""it must be the humor!"" So they put in humor to this one (and it's pretty funny at times) but the scenes where they're doing all the funny shit are separate from the scenes with action or the scenes with a more serious tone. Marvel has mastered the art of blending all three into a single scene.

The slow mo in the film was hit and miss. It was put to good use most of the time, but there were times it felt uneeded. There were alot of slow motioning turning to the camera.
  
Some of the dialogue was meh. And finally, the final fight scene wasn't that great. Wonderwoman seems realllly powerful. Maybe almost too strong.

dih7ptg,"I think Im going to step into the fray here as one of the few people who really didn't enjoy this movie that much. It was certainly one of DC's more succesful recent outings but the film was still absoloutely plagued with pacing, script and editing problems. I'm genuienly suprised at the critical reception of the film. 

There were dozens of odd editing choices which threw me back into reality and wonder what was going on, but more than anything in the final action scene. Two of my (least) favourite were the moment WW [is staring down Ares through the tower window and reaches behind her back to grab the sword (which at this moment in time is still an important item in the fight) but grasps nothing, as the sword was still impaled through the dead German general on the roof. The film then cuts away to a short update on the Steve situation, and when it cuts back to WW, she is back in the same spot and has retrieved the sword, with no explanation as to how.](#spoiler) All I could think at that moment was why set up that first moment of jeopardy or realisation in the first of the 2 scenes if it isnt going to add to the suspense? If [Ares and WW then had to fight for position as WW tries to retrieve the sword which gets knocked around just out of reach of both characters, the the first empty sword grab would have made perfect sense. Why not just have WW have the sword back in her posession in the first scene it added literally NOTHING to the scene!?](#spoiler). The second was a much more typical DC-esque blooper of an edit. Cut to Steve [sprinting after the bomber on the runway. Probably 50-60 feet behind a plane, which is by definition of the second scene, nearing taking off speed. JUMP CUT. Steve is suddenly jumping on the wing of the plane. How did he get there? Why start him so far from the plane in the first place if you have no explanation on film as to how he caught up with it?](#spoiler). Maybe I'm getting picky and just watch too much Every Frame a Painting in my old age, but the multitude of editing, pacing and continutiy errors throughout the film made it difficult for me to endure, especially over some of the MASSIVELY drawn out action-less sequesnces. 

It wasn't a bad film at all, but the talk of this being on Dark Knight/Better Marvel film levels is way off in my opinion. ",6erigc

dicq9ld,"Thought it was great, overall. One of the best DC movies, certainly the best of the DCEU so far. Few questions and things that bugged me:

* Where was Zeus while all this was going down? Did he just decide there was no point in stopping his son this time around and he'd just leave it to his daughter?

* If Ares was the reason the world was at war and he died at the end of WWI, why did WWII happen? Steve goes into a whole speech about how maybe it's not a god causing men to do bad things, men can choose to do good or bad on their own. But then it's revealed that Ares *is* behind the war after all.

* Why didn't Diana's mother tell her anything? Obviously she wanted to protect her, but she sent her daughter after the god of war with a useless sword and no knowledge of who she was or what she was capable of. The Queen said Ares would just find Diana faster if she knew who she was, but Diana literally walks into Ares' office within an hour of arriving in London.

* The Queen doesn't give ANY Amazon support, abandoning their responsibility to protect the world. I kept expecting the Amazons to ride in on horses at the end, but it never happened. They're not even that great of an army - their training and athleticism is great, but they almost got wiped out by a few rowboats full of Germans because they ran at them in a line with ancient weapons. If it's their duty to protect the world, you would think they would send someone off the island every once in a while to check how things are going outside, and they would have noticed that everyone has replaced bows & arrows with guns and planes.

* Why did Steve have to fly away in the plane and blow it up? They said the gas had a lethal range of 50 miles, and there's no way he got 50 miles away before blowing it up. Unless he pulled a Batman and ejected before it detonated and moved to Italy with Anne Hathaway.",6erigc

dikgbpc,"Just came back from watching it for the first time. I will start by saying what i liked which amounts to basically 4 things in general: The musical score enhanced the overall experience as a score should, really good job on that part. Production values was on par with a movie of the caliber and everything looked mostly great with dark tones for the period and whatnot. The third thing was the morals of the story which werent forced nor constantly repeated throughout making it tiresome, it felt fresh in that aspect. The fourth one would be the timing as basically no part of the movie felt overdone (like slow mo or other types of scenes).

Now what i didn't like unfortunately outshines the good aspects of it. Gal Gadot is awful in my opinion, she always seems to be smiling regardless of the emotion she is trying to convey i dont like that type of acting, i like range and in my opinion gadot has very limited range.
Second of all were the 'twists' [in which you would get an all powerful character (who could have done the job himself) to try to get the main character to join him in a cliched manner to do his bidding](#spoiler)
Third was the way Gadot was totally unlike the rest of the amazonians even when she grew with them.
Fourth, forced moments like [chris pine's character forcing himself to die with the plane instead of stopping the deployment of the gas by stopping the plane while in the ground shooting at the tires for example](#spoiler)
Fifth was 0 warrior-like appearance from gadot, no muscularity whatsoever, someone who trains hard like Diana was supposed to will just be buff or have more muscular mass than fat % so their muscles just show.
Sixth could be the cliched love story, it just feels tired and forced.
Seventh could be some forced plot points but i guess that would be more nitpicking than my other points so i will not pursue this point further.
All in all there were some great ideas for the film but something/someone messed it adding stupid ideas and ruining the film as a result.
I guess i could say i somewhat enjoyed what i could from the movie and the rest just disappointed me. At least i hope the next DC movies will be either as bad as this (which was acceptable i suppose) or better which would make them more enjoyable than batmanvsuperman, green lantern, and other recent attempts.",6erigc

She had to have everything explained to her and it really held the movie back, and it held her character down. I understand that she was raised on an isolated island, but the only thing in which she was portrayed as competent was fighting.  Everything else was luck.

djei2fe,"So I got around to seeing Wonder Woman finally. To make a long story short, I absolutely loved it. Of course, you might say ""Well of course YOU liked it. You enjoy all of that capeshit"". First of all, no I don't. BvS was one of the biggest dumpster fires I've ever seen, but Wonder Woman surprised me with how good it was, and it was special to me for a couple of reasons.
First, I think that it nails the character in a way that I've never seen before. I've watched the Lynda Carter series from the 70s, and of course have read some comics, but I've never really been able to connect to her as a character. I always thought she was kind of boring to be honest, and the lore behind her backstory felt muddled and half-baked to me, but the film version of her story makes almost perfect sense. If you've seen the Thor movie, she's kind of like him, except for the fact that her childlike naivete about life is justified. Think of every idealistic kid who sees how shitty the world is, how evil it can be, and wants to go out and fight the good fight, only to come home dejected and depressed because it's not that simple for one person to make a difference. That's Diana.
Another thing I liked is that it was a standalone story, not connected to the other DCEU films(Thank god). Other than the opening and closing scenes, this movie could have been a one and done deal because of its theme. In general, Marvel films seem to be more about the ""world outside your window"" ethos, the fun of mixing over the top fantasy and science fiction with a world that is close to our reality, while DC, for good or for ill, is generally about different ideas that it wants to explore. Wonder Woman is a bit of a hybrid of both. The fantasy aspect of an entire island of demi-god warrior women with the horrors of World War I turns out to be a very intriguing cocktail. Believe me, this is a war film, they don't Disneyfy it at all, which made me appreciate the themes that it was attempting to deal with.
Unlike the films of the DCEU so far, the action is kinetic and exciting. There's absolutely no cornball stuff going on here. It's also by far, by FAR, the most warm, human, and witty film in the DCEU. The characters, even the side characters, feel like real people with depth, and aren't just plot devices. Even the villains in the film are intriguing in their own ways, despite limited screen time.
Not counting The Lego Batman Movie, it's the best DC film since The Dark Knight Rises. However, the movie I'd compare it to the most is Richard Donner's Superman from 1978 in that it nails the personality of the character down flat. A character who by all rights should be easy to mock or make fun of, but is so effortlessly charming that you just can't help but get emotionally invested in it.
The stuff that happened with the Alamo Drafthouse women only screenings last month is a bit weird now, in retrospect, because this is a movie that anybody could enjoy. Then again, lulz.",6erigc
did10cg,"If you were to tell me before that I would like WW more than any Marvel movie, I would have laughed in your face.

I had no interest in Wonder Woman, World War 1 settings is not that exciting either. However, I have looked at the extremely positive reception and decided to give it a go.
 
This movie is incredible. It is a breath of fresh air in the superhero genre. The cinematography is engaging and catching: not overly saturated or pale. A mix of either to accent the scene when needed. Suit and dress design are very interesting. While the soundtrack is not extraordinary it works with the movie and gives some unique melodies (WW theme FTW).

What skyrockets this movie into the realm of incredible is acting and character development. Pine and Gadot are my new favourites, incredible actors. Most of the emotions are delivered with actions and facial expressions. You can legit watch this movie on mute with subtitles and have the same level of engagement with the characters

Humour was on point (for me). Not shoehorned as it comes naturally from the comical situations or characters.

Actions scenes. Wanna watch a whole city turn into a meteor while Avengers fight an army of robots? I guess.. Wanna see a woman deflect missiles and do some acrobatic ""fuck yous"" in slow motion? Yes. Fucking. Please. Actions were unique and slow mo worked incredibly

did85ew,"It was fine. But my main gripe is the setting. To me it really felt like they wanted a WW2 movie but couldn't because Captain America. You have the evil Germans the bombed out town. The massive bomber and crazy weapons of death. It just felt like a missed opportunity to do something different rather than rehash captain America with a ww1 skin. I also have to question a lot of the logic of the movie. Theres a bombed out town 50 yards behind a trench line that hasn't moved for a year and the Germans are only now subjugating the locals? Its a meaningless nit pick but really just shows I wasn't particularly engaged in the movie.

I guess I just found WW very inconsistent in her powers. She gets cut by a bayonette and punched but immediately has the reflexes to deflect any and all bullets from every direction and can be slammed around like a rag doll with no harm. Its like she gained a major power up the moment she left the island. For instance she can fly sometimes or at least hover with no explanation. And her greaves are indestructible? To the point they can absorb enough energy to destroy a literal god? Do all the Amazons have those? Why don't they make all their armour indestructible? Instead of easily pierced by a bullet. Not to mention no helmet or limb protection. What was that force explosion thing she accidentally used on her Aunt? Why didn't she use it again? Also what happened to dr poison? And most importantly what was the function of the book ends? They seemed completely out of place. Serving no purpose except to tie it to the next movies.

Not a particularly great analysis I admit just the things that floated through my mind while I was watching. All in all it was fine. Not great not terrible 5/10 probably won't watch again but doesnt further damage my opinion of the DCU.",6erigc
diq3mcn,"The good:

* Great direction. Everything was beautiful. Good pacing. No boring lulls. Great origins story.
* Beautiful people. I didn't watch any trailers or follow the news. Was pleasantly surprised by Claire Underwood and Chris Pine. Of course, Wonder Woman herself was gorgeous and played the innocent/oblivious role very well. Visually, she is the best fit of any of the current line up of DC heroes.
* Awesome action. Some people say the last act was too much CG, but I prefer the fantastical fighting. Although I thought Ares would have been visually more appealing as a bigger man. 
* Subtle comedy was enjoyable.

The bad:

* Cosplay as a feminist film. Wonder Woman is empowered by the first man she meets. They fuck. He commits suicide to save the day. She discovers her true power through ""love"" once he dies. I was really hoping they pulled a Frozen and had Wonder Woman remember how Claire Underwood raised her.
* Predictable/generic plot. The instant the old guy said, ""oh I changed my mind and here's money to do the mission,"" we all knew he was actually evil. The other evil guy had no presence, and poison lady was a horrible caricature.
* Wonder Woman didn't fly. I'm guessing they're saving this power for a later movie.",6erigc

difx7i4,"Not a bad movie but not a particularly good one either.

I think the biggest oversight is the conflict between her war like nature (she did eagerly kill a bunch of Nazis) and her desire to end war by killing Ares.  Maybe she should have paused in an introspective moment to wonder if she was part of the problem. 

Also the action at the end was very boring and I blame it on the CG objects ramming into one another over and over again like plastic children's toys -- without any real consequences.

I think the action was at its best when it was grounded in the trenches and it should have ended that way without some crazy god-on-god CG fest.

I liked the images of strong women and I hope they can frame that idea in a better movie next time.",6erigc
digt7mt,"Saw it last night. I have to admit it disappointed me. I guess it had something to do with all the critical praise and the fact that it has been declared as the best DC film since The Dark Knight. I went in with quite high expectations because of said things. 

The first act was full of boring exposition, the villains are one-dimensional, and much of the story has been done a million times before. The film just had nothing new to offer for me. On the positive side though, Gal Gadot and Chris Pine did good jobs in their roles. I had fun watching Danny Huston as the ""German"" general. The action sequences were cool-ish though it relies heavily on slow-mo. In the end of the day, it's like your average MCU film which is an improvement from DCEU's last two outings.

5.9/10",6erigc

I loved so much when they were first on the boat that she was totally indifferent to him and was focused on her goal. She was totally unfazed by his looks and charm and didn't need him at all. It annoyed me that, of course, in about a week the woman has to fall in love with the hunky guy, because what else is a woman supposed to do around him. 

I absolutely hated that they had sex. Just like all the Batman, Superman, Iron Man, etc sex scenes that they have. They seriously couldn't have a woman super hero not fall in love with a man? There was so much potential to break the mold and do something different.

I really enjoyed the movie overall, but that really annoyed me.

The side characters are poorly developed, if at all, and the character of Diana is at once clueless about the world and highly principled ... both unaware of how people act yet certain of the right way to act. It's a contradiction that's played for laughs and some moralizing but in the end it didn't really congeal for me. The final showdown and the ""flashback to 5 minutes ago"" was laughable and didn't make much sense in the context of the story. Par for the course for DC films, sup-par for most of the superhero movies I've seen.",6erigc

dj5d140,"I just saw it last night, and I was disappointed. My coworkers kept raving about it, but I was pretty bored during the film. I felt that it hit virtually every cliche in superhero films; it also borrowed some elements from Xena - I was a huge fan btw. The scene where WW saved Scot felt very Little Mermaidish - she could have started singing ""Part of Your World"" and I would not have cared. Additionally, and I probably should not complain about this in an action film, but there was just too much CGI. The lasso of truth was horribly done in my opinion, it reminded me of the 70s Wonder Woman. 

It was just stock full of cliches - superhero launched into a strange world, love interest has to help hero adapt, hero, who has idealistic views of good and evil disagrees with some of the moral decisions made on Earth, hero decides that he/she will save the world because people are inherently good, hero is then jaded when discovering the world is painted in gray, not black and white, hero falls in love too quickly, hero fights the ""big boss"" who is always someone that the audience already met, hero is virtually about to die and then he/she sees love interest get injured or killed and that imbues him/her with the strength needed to defeat the baddie, hero continues on at the end crime-fighting.

I saw Batman vs Superman last year and that was a terrible movie. Wonder Woman was only slightly better due to the actor that played Scot. Loved him. I thought that Gadot's acting was flat. I was not all convinced in those scenes where she screamed at Scot about his indecisions. ",6erigc
dicrsyu,"I really liked it, but man that 3rd act. 

Dude who was fighting for peace is actually Ares? What kind of message is that sending?

She should have been more heartbroken at the end. Nothing in that ending justifies her staying away from humanity that long. If anything, the opposite should have happened. She should have seen that humanity is good deep down and decided to protect that. 

They kept building up the idea that just killing Ares wouldn't fix humanity. But then she kills Ares and everything is fine. 

Everything else was so well made. ",6erigc

It's a good movie overall, not only a good superhero movie. On the other hand, I can't understand all the praise this film has been having... it's surely due to the fact it has a female superhero and a female director. But the truth is, the female director commits the exact same mistakes, to the point of making them worse, that her male counterparts usually make, including the cringy cliches, the bad acting, predictable plot and characters, sexual objectification of women (sorry guys, but girl power is much more than a girl with muscles who defeats men... please) etc. etc. oh well...",6erigc

Better than Suicide Squad, that's 4 damn sure. 

I suppose the twist of Ares' identity was a *little* obvious, least to me, but it was a neat little twist. I wish the film was a *bit* darker in tone, with a smidge less slapstick humor. I was wondering how they'd nerf Ares, but I never expected them to give him lighting powers, which is something never given to him in any incarnation I can think of and... telekinetic abilities to boot... don't know why they just didn't go with the whole ""conflict makes him stronger"" thing he has in the comics. But all in all, a decent flick. High matinee at the very LEAST. C'mon, Justice League!

digd992,"The most Marvel, DC movie in the best possible way. The funny moments and lines felt like they're in reality, based on the characters presented. 

I got nervous seeing the trailers with Steve's assistant Etta, because I felt like she was gonna be a big part of the movie and simply there to crack a joke. Which is the problem I have with most Marvel movies, is they add a character to just be the funny supportive guy/ girl. But no they kept her role pretty small which is great, because otherwise she was gonna be that character. 

Also seeing Ewan Bremner was in the movie, got me nervous. I love Ewan but sometimes he's just thrown into movies to be the comedic  relief (like Pearl Harbor), and he is such a better actor then just that. He turned out to be one of my favorite characters because he felt real, just like almost all the other characters. The only one that didn't was Dr. Poison her lines felt forced.

Don't get me wrong most Marvel movies are 6 or 7 out of 10 for me, which is fine/good. And the few that does get above like Captain America Winter Soldier know how to have fun at some points but stay in the framework of reality, which Wonder Women certainly did.

Nope, let me steal a dress and distract Steve from the convo with Dr Poison where he could potentially get access to the poison bombs right then and there.

This will probably be the first DCEU movie I see a second time, and so far the only one I'd actually buy. Marvel is going to have to up their game now. ",6erigc
dici526,"Just saw it, and found it to be (finallly) a solid outing from DC - not perfect, but certainly enjoyable. Gal Gadot's Diana conintues to be badass; it was fun to see her action scenes ramp up from ""Captain America-esque"" to ""Force of Nature."" 

Chris Pine was an enjoyable foil, even if he was a bit too perfectly imperfect throughout Diana's (pretty heavy-handed) loss-of-innocence/naivete arc. A lot of great energy from him, too - definitely kept the quieter moments from dragging. 

I enjoyed David Thewliss's creepy post-reveal Ares a lot - unfortunately, he was much more run-of-mill Comic Book movie Villain once he assumed his ""final form"" and duked it out with Diana (to be fair - that's not a unique issue to this movie). 

I'm not sure if we got enough Etta - I feel like we could have seen more Lucy Davis, but her shtick might have gotten old in bigger doses.

Patty Jenkins put together an interesting looking movie too - the WWI-era trenches set off Diana's kinetic action scenes pretty well, Every so often - particularly near the end, some effortless stuntwork, effective camera work and editing remind us that she's not quite contained by the mortal world and little bit ""something else.""

Or he should have used his ""aura"" to create super soldiers to fight Diana for a little while, while he stepped back to work on a bigger assault. Instead, he threw stuff or her around? The only good plan of his in that fight was to drop the land mass on top of her. Though that brings up a good point, this should have been a smarter fight. The god of war should put up a really well thought out fight, one that would require Diana to recall things from her training to combat, instead of using the power of love to just simply overpower him.

The CGI for the stunts/jumps didn't look that convincing.

Having no background knowledge of Wonder Woman, the whole Greek mythology was kinda iffy, especially when Ares popped up in the end.

diex5sg,"I feel like my opinion on this film is very different from a lot of other people's opinions, same for how I actually enjoyed Batman v Superman when everyone else despised it. So, I may get downvoted, but nonetheless this is my opinion:

I really didn't like this film. I mean, there were a lot of absolutely fantastic moments (i.e. the No Man's Land sequence) but in the end I was disappointed. As a bit of a history buff I was upset on how they abandoned the actual history of WWI, but a film set in that era was still cool, and the action made up for it.

Throughout the film Diana seemed completely without logic. I understood the ""We need to beat up Ares!"" concept, but when Steve actually tried telling her something logical she would flip shit and go off and do her own thing, possibly setting the Allies back greatly. She never really learned from this, either.

The CGI was really uncanny in this film, like for example whenever she did one of those superjumps (which BvS and SS also had an issue with, might I add) and the greenscreening was really obvious in a lot of parts, especially when the last thing we saw in the film was that cliché jump where we saw both of those things.

Now, by far my biggest grip with the film was the villain, Ares. I do want to say the casting was really top notch for this film, but not for Ares. As many have pointed out he basically looks like Nigel Thornberry in Skyrim armor. Wasn't really hyped.

When Steve said something along the lines of ""There is no Ares. Maybe, sometimes, men aren't all good."", it was perfect. They could've ended somewhere with that message and just focused on the goal Steve was trying to accomplish. After that, though, Ares showed up and revealed that he's the reason all of these conflicts have started, subtly forgetting about WWII and the Cold War. It felt like it abandoned a really cool message in favor of having a tacky villain.

I don't know, overall I have to rate this a 6/10. I was really hyped for this and I feel like I was the only one left disappointed based on the ratings.

The editing mostly in the beginning is very jumpy and feels all over the place. The dialog felt very clunky at times, mostly whenever they are talking about ares.

But I think it was clumsy and careless at times. For example, one liners that came out really cheesy and all you had to do was make a retake but still they decided to keep them there. 

They spent a lot of time introducing the crew and they barely have any role in the conflict other than show 3 more guys are ""in this for more than just money"". Their characters were inconclusive and they didn't even appear after the final battle.

Some parts were better than others though. But oh my the action. Way too much slow-mo that killed what could've otherwise been insane fight scenes in the first half. The only part I can actually say that I liked was when she used her lasso to pull the one nazi in for a super-fast kick. That was cool (although I immediately thought about how little tension there was in the scene altogether). My main problem with the movie was with the action scenes. Like, I genuinely didn't get it. I know she hadn't fully realized he powers yet, but am I actually supposed to get excited while watching a demi-god wipe the floor with regular humans? She wants to save humanity, but has little if any qualms randomly killing some soldiers while merely incapacitating others?  Okay? Then there was her little ""warriors 3"" with gender bent Sif. Trevor was fine and it was interesting to see them delve into the sniper's PTSD, but overall they were bland and I couldn't care about any of them. (RIP Steven Trevor, even though I don't care...) And don't even get me started on the final fight. It was a quintessential example of a ""meh"" finale.

There was that scene after Diana kills the general where Steve tells her that people aren't inherently good and will wage war without the help of the gods.

* There's just not much to the character. Diana starts as a spunky kid that already has the makings of a hero, then she goes out and becomes one. She loses hope in mankind, but only for about 5 minutes of screen time until Trevor's sacrifice.
* Some of the action was cool except for the gratuitous slow-mo, but it all seems too easy. She didn't struggle much to accomplish anything after leaving Themyscira. Did she even get hurt at all?

Since Zeus and the other gods died long ago, I think it would've been more powerful to not have Ares survive into present day either. After she kills Luffendorff (sp?) and it turns out he was just some guy and the war doesn't stop, this could throw into question what she's doing there since there's no Ares and humans really are just shitty.

What's odd for me about this movie is I really didn't enjoy it. But not because of my initial concerns. Gadot IS Wonder Woman. She nailed it! She was able to pull of the physicality of a female superhero wonderfully. And she personified the grace, beauty, and strength of Wonder Woman. What really stood out to me was I could see in her performance how much reverence and respect she has for the character -- her performance as Wonder Woman has a sincerity to it that is so convincing that I never fault Gadot for when the movie misses its mark. I fault the writing and directing.

dideg3z,"Spoilers follow.

Patty Jenkins did an excellent job with this movie. Monster was relatively low scale and this is a big budget venture - she has shown she could do it all.

Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL are legends for the theme they gave us. They also did a good job with the variations of the wonderful theme. Loved the music throughout.

Villains - Ares was perfect. I guess the theory that if the threat is more grounded it becomes more convincing is true. Ares' motivations were so convincing. David Thewlis did the perfect job. I love some good old Prof. Lupin.

Parallels - between MOS and Wonderwoman. When I saw Snyder was a part of the storymaking team, I knew this would be intentional. When Ares shows WW a ""better"" world of peace and tries to manipulate her it was a reminiscent of MOS scene with the dark truth and Zod (the one with the black suit).

Steve fucking Trevor - Chris Pine did such a good job playing him. Perfect comic timing as a result of Diana's innocence. Gal Gadot - She truly is WW. This movie is proof that she is an excellent actress. Damn she can act and she is beautiful, has excellent screen presence.

Fights - DC has been on point with the fight sequences. The village clearing sequence was a masterpiece (even better than warehouse sequence in BvS and as exciting as Zod v Superman in MOS). The screenplay paved way for a build of suspense leading to the fight sequences. I wanted to see more of WW and Patty's magic when the movie ended. Expected them to tease the sequel, but I guess they did deliver with the ending sequence.

""Superhero tries to end WWI"" is basically the whole thing. I'd have rather this entire movie had been a 5-10 minute prologue and the rest taken place in modern times featuring some other DC universe characters.

I also loved Chris Pine as Steve Trevor (every scene between him and Gadot is a joy), Connie Nielsen as Queen Hippolyta, Robin Wright as Antione, Lucy Davis as Etta Candy (really loved her)...everyone was perfect. The first act (Paradise Island) was just right, and the middle section with Diana as the fish-out-of-water in early 20th century Europe was fun, with the No Man's Land and village battle top-notch action sequences. Things kind of slip in the third act into predictable comic-book-movie-finale territory with a somewhat overwrought (in my opinion) final battle and I felt the ending didn't really land right, but all-in-all the movie delivered what I wanted - great action, charismatic leads, funny moments - and it is definitely the best summer blockbuster I've seen so far, unlikely to be challenged by anything other than Luc Besson's ""Valerian"".

I feel the best part of the movie was actually Diana and Steve Trevor. Their relationship for me didn't feel contrived and they had a few great moments. Chris Pine was great in this. 

I felt the fighting was a bit off at times, I'm not even talking about the massive leaps and stuff she does, I think it was the slow motion that made it worst and felt over stylized at times. I thought it was unnecessary. 

I was surprised to see Robin Wright in this [and I wish they didn't kill her! Man, I would have loved to see her in the following battle that takes place in Justice League](#spoiler). 

This movie also felt kind of long and I only say that because of the disappointing CGI fight at the end.

Only annoying things are: A) the Germans speak English with a german accent. I would guess the producers didn't feel the audience is patient enough to read subtitles. It feels corny; B) Politically speaking, the Germans in WWI were not really ""evil"", this is a very historically myopic way of portraying them. Pretty much everyone agrees in the historical dialogue surrounding the Great War that it was essentially a pissing content with no ""good side.""

Really enjoyed the movie and much of the praise I could give it has already been mentioned here many times. I will, however, bring up something I felt and I've seen a lot of others have felt. The big CGI ending.

I was honestly happy with there being a big CGI ending. I wanted to see Ares in his god form. I thought his armor and everything looked good, but there were a couple hiccups. First, I would have preferred they either had him shape shift into someone else during the flashback/god-mode OR make the Thewlis look less...like a middle aged British man. give him a full beard or something in the flashback at least! But I consider that a really minor gripe. My bigger issue was, for lack of a better term, his 'move set'.

He can fly? Okay fine. He can levitate objects at will? Ehhhhh. He shoots lightning? No, no, dear god no. NOOOOOOOOOO. But seriously, it was just a little generic for my taste. Like, the powers didn't reflect him at all, they were just powerful attacks a big bad guy can often do. What I would have liked is more classic Greek weaponry. He used it a little, but it was eclipsed by his more ostentatious powers. How I would have really liked the fight to go down is this: Earlier in the movie, have Wonder Woman fight Antiope during training and have it be very specifically choreographed. Something easily picked up and remembered by audience, and have Wonder Woman fail and receive a lesson. Then, during the Ares fight, strikingly similar choreography takes place, except at the part she failed earlier, she now remembers Antiope's words and succeeds. That not only is a more personal conclusion to Wonder Woman's quest, but it really makes Antiope's influence on Diana that much more apparent.

Really though, these are small issues. It was overall a great super hero movie. Now all DC has to do is make Justice League decent and people will begin to trust them again. If Justice League is bad however, get ready for years and years of DC hate reinvigorated and vindicated.",6erigc

That's a lot to ask in a 140 min. And it's fine. It plays out fine, but there's all these little moments that the movie rushes through that could be their own (and frankly more interesting) story. In regards to how this movie will stand the test of time, I think it'll be just another summer blockbuster movie. But, like the much-maligned 2016 Ghostbusters reboot, I think what's most important and what is needed now is more female heroes. More female characters. Noble ones girls can look up to; watching a woman doing what she wants, or what she feels necessary, or doing good for the common man, or hell, being a terrifying villain. This doesn't excuse making a bad movie with female characters. But we're still not a point yet where we can talk about a female-led movie as just a movie instead of remarking at how nice it is that we have one finally.

Some things that stood out for me. Is the Amazon an allegory for Israel? Jews, chosen people, etc...? Interesting coincidence since Gadot is Israeli. Blatant Jesus symbolism again at the end when she unleased the thunder. 

7.9/10 for me. Probably the best DC movie till date. But still not as good as Dark Knight which IMO is the greatest superhero film of all time.",6erigc

dietd65,"Eh, I was hoping I'd like it more based on the reviews. It was pretty good, I'd give it a 6.5/10. Worth the $4 ticket from T-Mobile.

Here are some of the issues I had with it: 

1) I really did not like the action scenes very much. Sooo much slow motion and the choreography just didn't do it for me. The biggest exception to this was the No Man's Land scene which was the highlight of the movie.

2) The third act as many have mentioned was a mess. I pretty much predicted the Ares fake-out although I did not predict who he really was, not that it really mattered. We barely saw that character so it wasn't an interesting twist. The Ares fight was awful. What were his powers? What are Diana's powers? At first he was teleporting and stopping her lasso with telekinesis. But later the lasso works just fine. And what was happening when Ares threw all those blades at Diana? It looked like she was stopping them with telekinesis. Did she get some of Ares' powers? And it just dragged on for way too long. I just wanted her to beat him already because of how uninteresting the fight was. It was just a jumbled up mess. 

But there was lots of good in the movie too. Diana's character was very well developed and grew over the course of the movie. Her chemistry with Steve was great and it sucks that he died. I'd say it was on par with Man of Steel which I thought was pretty good too. Better than SS and BvS by miles at least. Glad so many people loved it though.",6erigc

Gal Gadot was phenomenal and I really feel like they did WW justice. I mean, she can go toe to toe with Supes so it felt pretty cool to see her cut loose at the end of the movie. 

Also, remember when everyone was jerking it to Captain America holding that helicopter in Civil War? Can we get another jerk going for Wonder Woman making her own hand holds to climb a wall? Or breaking a rifle over her back? Goddamn, I was at full mast instantly for those two scenes. ",6erigc
dipgwsl,"It was pretty good, but I felt like I'd already seen it before, with better CG, better fight choreography, in the first Captain America.

Perhaps it's just that Hollywood prefers to give heroines more dance-like fighting styles, where they can CG-in the stuff going on around them, and that's a real shame for Wonder Woman. I was hoping to see some really physical, raw, DBZ-esque fights, but I also wanted that in Thor 2, so... maybe I'm just picky :/",6erigc

dif47on,"I actually have a problem with her origin. It just isn't compelling. So in the movie, Hipollyta keeps Diana and Themyscera hidden from the world because she is afraid Ares would find her. Okay, good enough, but why does this mean ALL Amazons have to hide themselves away? They were given the task of protecting people so just because they have to hide Diana, it doesn't make much sense to me that your Amazon warriors also have to be locked away too. Also when Diana decides to leave, Hipollyta tells her she may never come back again. If the point is to hide her, why doesn't she send in her warriors to help her out instead? Because now that Diana is going to be exposed, the reason for hiding your  paradise is no longer there. In the comics I've read, their reason is that mankind betrayed them and sacked Themyscera. This caused Hipollyta and a lot of them to be angry at mankind in general, so any mingling with them is considered sacrilege. Diana will never be allowed back if she chooses to leave, even though she is their princess, which makes her decision to do so all the more powerful. It just didn't have the same feel here.

dija58v,"I saw the movie the other day. I'm not gonna lie, I was a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad movie but it was just alright. I'll go through some of the the pros and cons


Pros:

Gal Gadot did an excellent job portraying Wonder Woman. She really nailed the physical looks and emotions of Wonder Woman. She even did a great job portraying someone experiencing a different society and culture for the first time. She was curious and stubborn by everything around her which made her feel alive. Out of all the current DC character portrayals her’s is by far the best.

Chris Pine was surprisingly charming and really fun to watch on screen. You really felt connected to this character as he steps up and tries to do the right thing. I was surprised by the amount of screen time he had. I thought the Wonder Woman was going to be the entire focus of the film but he had a decent amount of screen time and even stole some of the scenes.

The story was engaging and felt like a breath of fresh air compared to the recent DC films. This movie felt like an origin story that really cared about the main character. You had an understanding of the struggles Wonder Woman goes through and it’s really heartwarming watching her conquer them. I liked that a lot of the big things like [overcoming her protective mother by training](#spoiler) were taken care of at the beginning to make room for the story.

The setting. Making this movie take place during WWI was really risky but I'm glad to say that it works really well. I thought the movie was going to be too toned down for a war setting because it's PG-13 but they did a good job showing the horrors of war with what they had. The only thing that threw me a bit off was the lack of blood.

The movie wasn’t overly feminist. It had a strong female lead who took charge and saved the day while going against the gender stereotypes of the early 20th century. Other than that, there was no propaganda or biased message taking away from the story. It treated the film like a comic book movie first and then 

Chris Pine’s speech at the end. Wonder Woman believed [killing General Ludendorff would end the war so after failing, Chris Pine gave a speech about how there is not one bad guy responsible for everything in war but rather many people doing bad things that cause it](#spoiler). It was a really deep and intelligent moment in the film.

Cons:

Gal Gadot and Chris Pine don’t have chemistry. Despite the fact that they both had tremendous performances, they didn’t really work well together. 

Queen Hippolyta’s motivation didn’t make sense. Wonder Woman is [the God Killer so it makes sense that she’d train to stop Ares. I know Hippolyta was afraid of Wonder Woman’s training bringing Ares back but it seemed inevitable anyways. It seemed like they added this plot point just to add it](#spoiler)

Wonder Woman came across as a hypocrite. I know that Wonder Woman has killed people in the comics before but [she thought the German soldiers were good people corrupted by Ares for the purpose of war. It seemed like she believed they were innocent but she goes around killing them left and right. It’s unsettling to think that she’d kill “innocent” people despite wanting to save them](#spoiler)

The movie was too long. Much like Batman v. Superman, I thought this movie dragged out too much, especially towards the end, and would’ve been fine if it was 45 minutes shorter. It seemed like there was a bit too much exposition and scenes that went nowhere.

Besides Wonder Woman, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), General Ludendorff, and Dr. Poison, none of the other characters were memorable. There was a small group that formed about halfway with Wonder Woman, Trevor and three other people without really any characteristics other than being the “Scotish guy”, the “foreign guy” and the “Native American”. That’s the only way I remembered them because nothing else stood out. They tried giving them character development and while it wasn’t bad, it didn’t really connect me to them and ultimately they were forgettable which is a shame because they could’ve been good characters. I think the problem was that they were introduced too late. Other than them the other characters in the movie weren’t interesting. I feel like nothing would’ve changed if it was just Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor the whole time.

The action wasn’t good. It was kind of sloppy with flips and weird camera angles. That’s a little nit picky on my part but the one thing I really didn’t like was the excessive amount of slow motion. Almost every action scene had slow motion and it didn’t add anything to the experience and just made it kind of annoying to watch.

The villain. I was extremely disappointed when [the movie revealed Sir Patrick as Ares](#spoiler) I predicted it about halfway through the movie. I thought to myself “I wonder if [Sir Patrick is going to be the bad guy](#spoiler) “ but then I thought “Nah, that would be really stupid” but they actually did it. Also, doing this made [Chris Pine’s speech about there not being one bad guy in war pointless because Ares appeared five minutes after the speech and claims he caused everything](#spoiler) It also seemed like a cop-out to have a shock factor but it was more weird than shocking.

Overall the movie had some strong points but also suffered from a lot of flaws that were just too big for me to overlook. It’s definitely a movie worth watching and if you’re really into comic books you’ll probably like it. I’d give it a 6/10

",6erigc
dikjclt,"This movie uses color like an animated film. I don't think I've seen anything quite like it, and I want to see more like it.

Beyond that, though... the movie is still fucking amazing. Story and villains are a bit cliche, but it executes those cliches fairly well - better than most. I feel like I'm eventually going to get tired of the ""Building a new world from the old world"" speech - hell, it thoroughly bored me in X-Men Apocalypse - but as long as we can see it done in new ways, I'm all right with it.

I was also pretty impressed with the writing. Sure, there's some graceless exposition dumps here and there, but it seems like the writers actually understood that exposition isn't just something you can fill a scene with whenever there's a lull. The small scenes in this movie are remarkably memorable, and they're kind of rare in modern blockbusters. The movie isn't afraid to let its lulls - and the character interactions in said lulls - speak for themselves. ",6erigc
dil8zus,"This movie was one hell of a ride from start to finish. 

The chemistry between Gal and Chris was terrific, definitely on par with Xavier and Magneto in X-Men:FC (my all time favourite out of all superhero movies).

The jokes were actually funny and none of them felt forced. They were above average compared to other superhero movies. I love Gal in the ice cream part.

Loved the action scenes, especially the no man's land part and rescuing the village part. While some people don't like slow motions in action scenes, i like them a lot when it is used right, which i think they nailed it in this movie. I prefer slow motion over shaky cam with quick cuts in action scenes.

Chris Pine's death scene was extremely well done and it really brought out the feels. His facial expression before pulling the trigger was some of the best acting i've seen. I wouldn't be surprised if he wins or gets nominated for *best supporting cast* award for his performance in this movie.

The music was terrific, especially the [No Man's Land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ise1XcxOidQ) track. It still gives me chills when i listen to it.

The only thing that bothered me in this movie was the last battle against Ares. It was too CGI heavy and the lightning finishing move felt kinda off.

Overall, i give this movie a 9/10 score. I will definitely watch it again when it is out on bluray. Now i can't wait for Justice League.",6erigc

die2lb0,"I'll just copy my comments from /r/DCcomics:

I really liked this. I'd give it a DC 8.5/10, Marvel 9.5/10. I hold DC movies to a higher standard (despite them consistently letting me down before this one) because I think they can be great. I think the Marvel movies always follow a pretty set formula that the DC ones don't and that gives DC more potential. So yeah, I think this was better than a lot of Marvel movies and definitely better than all the other DC movies thus far but it could have been even better.

As far as the actual movie, I really liked that it wasn't just a Wonder Woman movie, but it was also a World War I movie. I know a lot of people have been comparing it to Captain America 1 and, while I liked that one, I think this one was much better. CA did a good job of showing the heroics of war but this one did a better job of showing war itself. The soldier with night terrors, the one who signed up because he couldn't be an actor, the soldiers coming back bloodied and broken (both emotionally and physically) and the gas scene were all great and horrible aspects of the movie. Also Steve. Idk if this was on purpose but I really liked the idea that he never settled down because he fully expected to die in the war. His desire to do what was right and his willingness to help Wonder Woman through her transition into the world really showed how great of a character he was. I kept expecting to see the jealous ex that I've seen in the comics but he was nowhere to be found. Every scene with him and Wondy were great.

Now on to Wonder Woman herself. I think my love of the character can be summarized in just one scene: the ice cream one. She's a warrior carrying around a sword and shield but she's still able to stop and enjoy some ice cream. That scene highlights why I liked this Wonder Woman and haven't really liked her in comics. Everything I've read of her has her being very militaristic, while this movie showed her as an actual person. Yes, she's powerful and badass, but she doesn't let that define her.

Now on to Lupin. Personally, I was pretty sure from his first scene that he was either Ares or Zeus. His character didn't really offer anything crucial to the movie other than being a helping hand and that just screams trickster deity or loving one. Honestly, I kinda wish he was Zeus. I'm a bit of a mythology buff so I was a little annoyed to see Ares throwing a lightening bolt lol and I think it would be really cool if we found out Zeus was actually the one who went bad out of boredom (or anger) with his creations so he started a big war to liven things up. I don't know much about the comic version of the pantheon though so that might have messed things up.",6erigc

dichk70,"DC proves again what superhero films can be be delivering the phenomenal film, Wonder Woman. I don't think I like it as much as Batman v. Superman, but it is a WONDERful (hurr) piece of art. It's definitely my favorite superhero origin movie.

Patty Jenkins (director) and Allan Heinberg (writer) completely get these characters and gave a really fantastic tale. From the perfect representations of the Amazons, to Steve Trevor, and of course Diana herself. It would have been very easy to falls into many tropes, yet the film rises above them. Diana is a fish out of water without being a fool, the duality of humanity is never shunned, and it would have been VERY easy to make this a simple ""battle of the sexes"" type story and the team knew to include Dr. Poison to firmly establish that when the film says ""mankind"" it means all of us. Dr. Poison is also wicked.

Wonder Woman's fighting style is beautiful, the action is fantastic and well shot, you can feel Diana's power and ability just pour off the screen. Gal made me happy as Diana in BvS, but firmly establishes that this role is HERS with this movie as she embodies everything I feel Diana is: A trained warrior that can break most, but feels love is the greatest weapon.

This film doesn't play with much symbolism, themes, or layers like Snyder does. This is not a positive or a negative to me, but it does come down to subjectivity. I think Patty brings a very fresh take on DC films and I think her movie is not only great, but also very accessible to wide audiences. While I still prefer BvS personally, I think a much higher number of people will love this film (which is a win for DC films). In addition to that, this keeps helping show how DIFFERENT each DC film is in terms of tone which I think is really great for continuing the movies.

A really great film that I think almost anyone can rally behind. I hope that it makes a ton of money at the box office (and I think it will) which will help firmly establish this universe as more than just popcorn films. I look forward to seeing Gal kill a bunch of Parademons in Justice League and I genuinely hope they keep Patty on board for Wonder Woman 2.

I definitely suggest to everyone to see this film, I loved it.

diedn1o,"Just saw this last night with the lads. All in all, it was a **good film**; it had some great action scenes, some powerful moments, and well-timed humour. It's a notch above most entries in the superhero genre. That said, it isn't great, and I'll dissect it now.

1. The Themiskyra section felt extremely rushed. I mean, in just *one* scene: [Wonder Woman's powers were revealed, Steve crashed, and the Germans found Themiskyra](#spoiler). Are you kidding me? Themiskyra should have gotten at least 20 more minutes of screentime, because I had absolutely no idea what kind of person Diana was or what her high motivations were when they moved on to Europe.

2. [Antiope's death was appalling. Seriously? So many good options to really shock the audience, and you telegraph her cliché sacrifice by almost 3 seconds?! A guy randomly running up into view and shooting her, because guns trump swords, would have really taken me by surprise.  Not to mention that she seemed to teleport a good few metres to block that bullet!](#spoiler).

3. The final fight was just... terrible. I know that Ares is supposed to be extremely powerful, but they could have put some structure and limitation to his powers. It seemed like he had the power to kill/subdue Diana a lot easier. Speaking of which, I get that Ares needed to have that 'armour attaches on' scene, but why so much CGI afterwards? Would making a real Ares costume really be that hard? It certainly would have looked better.

4. The final fight in general was pretty bland and chlichéd. Ares' monotone speaking made him seem incredibly 2D (not to mention that his actual motivations could have been better). I would have loved to seem some proper swordfighting between them, along with some magical attack moves that I hadn't seen a million times before (the finishing blow could have been handled a lot better).

5. While the action choreography was actually very good (thank God, they actually *shot* at her up close), there was waaay to much slow motion.

6. General Luttendorf was handled pretty badly. The use of music in the dance scene was unsuitable for a moment that could have been a lot more tense and dramatic. [I nearly facepalmed when he shot that officer in the face. That was just ridiculous](#spoiler).",6erigc

I've personally gotten more and more tired of the onslaught of superhero movies over the last 10-15 years or so.  The Garfield Spiderman reboot was stupid and DC's EU was a mistake.  Superman is boring, nobody will ever live up to Bale's Batman, there is already a Flash tv show, and nobody cares about Aquaman.  I'm not sure we really need a 3rd Thor movie either.  X-Men has been played out (though I hear Logan is great).  I'm not really sure where the Avengers go from here.  I was never a huge WW fan going into this.  After hearing the great reviews for WW I decided to give it a shot.  

I personally thought this was the best superhero flick since The Dark Knight.  I'd put it on par with the first Ironman.  A great and thoroughly enjoyable movie in this genre.  I'm a fan of the fish-out-of-water trope and you got it X2 here.  As a million other people have said, Gadot was made for this role.  Perfect casting.  Chris Pine was great too.  I thought the settings were pretty excellent too.  It made me think that we don't have enough movies about WW1.  As an origin story it was lightyears better than Capt. America's, which is the easiest comparison as the two early/mid 20th century war heroes.  The action was great.  Script was solid.  Not as witty as Iron Man, but Pine had some good lines that landed well.  Music was great, especially the main theme.  Love that riff.  Overall, as I mentioned, one of my favorite superhero movies, and possibly the best outside of the Nolan trilogy.  

A couple of weaknesses.  First, bad guy development.  While DC generally does a pretty good job with villains, WW's kinda fell short here.  Not a fatal flaw, but I didn't feel as let down by Ares' betrayal as I could have.  I would have liked to have known more about Dr. Poison as well and why she was the way she was.  Second, other than Chris Pine, the sidekicks were actually kinda a letdown.  The Scottish guy was an incompetent drunk, which felt kinda strereotypey.  The native american guy tells Diana about how Pine's people defeated his, but then that doesn't really go anywhere.  Sameer could have been better too and basically just drives the car.  Last, the stupid DC EU tie-ins.  The Marvel movies, for the most part, 100% stand on their own.  You don't need the Avengers to make sense out of them.  There is no need for a Bruce Wayne nod in WW.  I hate that they're going to make me see Justice League to get more WW.  People complain about the ending, but I thought it was fine.  Was happy they made the decision to kill Chris Pine as it makes everything hit harder.  Could have been better, but it was a pretty standard superhero movie ending IMO.

*Why exactly can't Diana return to the island? It was accidentally found by a human in a downed fighter plane and German soldiers in a few boats who were not looking for it, so why exactly is it ""impossible"" to find if she was actually looking for it?

*Why would telling her that she was half-god and not an ordinary Amazon make it ""easier"" for Ares to find her?

*If the island is hidden from the world and no men have been seen for at least a few decades and Diana is the first child born there for a long time... why do they not know anything about the outside world since ancient Greek times? Do they live an exceptionally long time without aging? Are they even human? Is the Island in a time bubble where time passes much more slowly than the outside world? 
Quite a few changes have happened since the ""bow and arrow"" days and WW1 that they seem to have not known anything about.

*Where did the Amazon warriors get all their battle scars... just in training? Or have they been fighting in wars outside of the island in the last 50 years?

*Why was the sword in the protected area of the island where they housed the ""gifts of the gods""? The rope of truth is obviously useful and not made in this world, the shield seems practically invincible, the armbands as well... but the sword seemed exceptionally unexceptional really. Was its purpose just a trick to distract anyone that happened to find the island looking for it from the true ""God Killer""?

*If a dying Zeus used the last of his power to create the ""god killer"" which is Diana, does that mean that just before he died his ""last power"" was the effort to have sex with the Amazon queen and impregnate her before he died? And also, when exactly was his last big battle with Ares when all the other gods were slaughtered and he was mortally wounded?... like 20 years before? And therefore how is the ""corruption of Ares"" in mankind explain the wars that were happening 2000 years ago in Amazonian legend?

*In Batman Vs Superman, Diana says ""I've fought monsters from other worlds before""... so by that, did she mean the Earth based  god Ares? Or something else? Ares doesn't quite seem to match that description at all.

*Also in BvS, Diana's character has pretty much given up on humanity, preferring not to get involved and live anonomously in the world so much that no-one is even aware that she exists. But at the end of this movie she seems to walk away from the experience which the exact opposite view of mankind and sure of her part to play in it. So what happened between the end of this movie and the beginning of BvS to make her character so different in her perspective and role in it? There seems to be a movie missing in the middle here.

I'm not ripping on the movie. These were genuine questions that I was thinking about while watching it and waiting for the answers to come, but they never did.",6erigc

Did Chris pines character have to fly into the sky at the end? Did I miss something? I feel like he had other options!

I keep hearing how amazing Robin wright's character was but she was barely in it! And died pretty quickly.

Ares was real after all, so when she killed him....should that be an end to war? Cos that isn't what happens.

All that aside very good movie and I'd watch it again.

djhxhr2,"I now have another favorite Princess Diana. I watched this film because it was what was available at the theatre, and that I had heard good things about it. I strongly dislike comic book movies, or don't really attach myself to them; after watching the Avengers, I swore to never watch another comic book movie again because of the humor that really insults my intelligence, and the lack of subtlety. 

After today, I am aware that what I should avoid are not comic book movies in general, just the Marvel ones. I grew up with a father who loved Star Wars, and disliked the franchise in a similar way that I dislike comic book movies. Yet, just like after I watched Rogue One and was pleasantly surprised leaving the theatre, this was a fun experience for me that I would go see again. 

**What I liked:**

-The casting of Princess Diana was an excellent choice. Picking a former soldier to play an action hero was really an excellent choice; Gadot was truly the right gal for the job. The rest of the casting was good, and the acting was nice, along with the special effects.
-I grew up studying history and reading Greco-Roman mythology. The film had me at the first battle scene on the beach. The juxtaposition of fantasy and history in this manner is something out of my dreams. I also think I will be playing Battlefield 1 again for a while after watching this movie.
-Everyone on the thread raves about the No Man's Land scene. While this is justified, it is not the kind of scene I came to see a comic book movie for. Instead, I loved the attack on Veld far more; good fight choreography, and amazing action. I also saw an antithesis to the sniper tower scene from saving Private Ryan in the form of a nervous sniper. Amazing! Again, juxtaposition of fantasy and history makes scores points with me so much. 
-The subtlety of the woman's empowerment message and the portrayal of diversity was well delivered and executed, particularly in the context of of the time period in which the story is set. The character of Princess Diana does not exist to explicitly liberate women, either in the film, or in the audience; she is merely a hero that happens to be a woman, not in spite of, nor because of that. The suffragist jibes of Etta Candy were so fitting. When loading the boats bound for the Western Front, there is a shot of one black soldier amongst a group of otherwise white British soldiers, which was nice to see, and if I recall, is rather historically accurate and believable (Battlefield 1, what do you have to say?).
-The romantic subplot, according to canon apparently, was necessary. I feel it was done well, and not in a cheesy, campy, or inappropriate way that did not match the serious tone of the film. The dance and romance after the attack on Veld sequence embodies this description. 
-Princess Diana is able to be portrayed as captivating and beautiful without any sexualization whatsoever. If it was otherwise, it would have really detracted from the film.

*ermagawd Amazons versus Germans ermagahd bows versus bolt-actions ermagahd Battlefield 1 ermaghd No Man's Land and Veld emagard ergghhhhhhhh*

**What I didn't like:**

-""Above average."" ""What's that?"" ""It's a watch."" ""Sleep with me!"" While the whole theater was laughing and giggling, I really cringed and did not enjoy the tension and those two scenes. The dialogue could have been more subtle, subdued, or substituted entirely. I feel that there would have been a better way to begin the romantic subplot of the film. This may be a rare opinion judging by the rest of the thread's comments, but again, I'm no comic book movie watcher. 
-Princess Diana is a fish out of water in London, and yet is able to know every human language that existed and will exist was awkward viewing for me. These things can easily be written away with good writing or different delivery. 
-Two cinematographic and editing elements bothered me: First, I felt that slow-motion was overused in the first two acts. It should have been used more at the climax! Second, to a lesser extent, the portrayal (not the ability) of superhuman jumps didn't suspend my disbelief during the sequences it was used, and felt a tiny bit awkward to watch.
-So much more could have been done with the characters, which I feel were wasted or could have contributed to the movie: Take Doctor Maru, played wonderfully by Elena Amaya. What could have been a key villain or an antithetical character to Princess Diana is merely discarded at the climax as a test of Diana's purpose and integrity, with her final moments spent running out of frame. That was a little unsatisfying. 
-The other three members of the 'band of commandos', while not lacking in character, save for the Chief and his dated rifle, could have been used more. I know that the main focus of the story is Princess Diana and her trusty Captain (Kirk?), but I felt like those guys deserved a greater share of the story.  
-Although I expected the reveal of the 'big bad'/main antagonist right from the start of the film (not the identity though; that was the surprise), I really feel that his character could have been more fleshed out, and thus contributed more meaningfully to the movie and its themes. 
-The execution of the climax was actually underwhelming for me for two reasons: 1. given the saturation of excellent action sequences in the movie, I feel that it did not stand up to the others in its choreography; 2. it had that Marvel 'feel', which I don't like so much.  

**What was neutrally noteworthy:**

-The standalone nature of the film did not hit me until after remember that, yes, this is not Gal Gadot's first outing as Princess Diana (as I said, I don't watch comic book movies). Someone in the thread pointed out that leaving the prologue and epilogue scenes would have been an improvement to the independent narrative of the film. I agree in that respect, but considering how the movie was certainly made with viewers of Batman vs. Superman in mind, I don't think the presence of references to Bruce Wayne (Enterprises) does any real harm.
-Some comments note the inconsistency of the languages spoken, juxtaposing the dialogue between Sameer and Diana at the pub in the second act, and when Samir and Steve attempt to enter the gala in the third act. I've spent a lot of time watching 'Allo 'Allo! and Hogan's Heroes, which use English often with a false accent for the benefit of English-speaking audiences, so this doesn't bother me so much. The complaint is completely legitimate though.
-What happened to the German transport ship at the end of the first act!?

did8vcj,"I'll preface this by saying that I loved, *loved* the film. Actually I've mostly got good things to say, so I'll get the bad out of the way first.

This almost feels like two films, or a film and a TV episode, or a film with two really different directors/writers/DP,  or just a film they failed to finish a part of. I disliked almost all of what located on Themiswhatsit up until Steve was having his bath/WW got the outfit, not because of what was happening, but how it was all happening.  
Compared to the rest of the film the fight choreography, quite a lot of the acting, the CGI/green screening, the beach fight, just terrible. Awful. The visual effects when they're training WW in particular, and on the beach, fighting on horseback, and I suppose when Steve escapes the camp in the plane, were laughably bad, to the point I was having trouble staying in the movie, and was getting slightly apprehensive that the rest of the film would be a total wash.

Happily, that wasn't the case. This movie was awesome.

First off, the cast were delightful. Danny Huston was excellent, and I really enjoyed Elena Alaya's Dr. Poison.  
Lucy Davis was fun, we definitely didn't get enough of her. Thewlis was decent. Would have liked a bit more from him, and he had a couple of shaky moments at the end, after his reveal (which I gladly didn't see coming, thought it might have been Maru somehow).

Gal Gadot is brilliant. Wonderful, even. Not only is she just spectacularly beautiful, utterly gorgeous, I just completely fell in love with her character. I thought she was one of the standouts in BvS despite not having a huge role, but she was the perfect lead in her own film. How she talked to Steve, the generals, Lucy, her general manerisms, when she got the ice cream, the fighting.  
Low point would either be her talking to her mother after Steve's trial(?) or the final leap just before the credits, high points, highest point, would be her talking to Steve in the boat, or anything involving her being a fish out of water. Be it the ice cream, walking through London, the snow. She was awesome.  

Chris Pine, however, absolutely stole the show as Steve Trevor. By a huge margin. Both the levity and solemnity of his character came through so well, worked so well in each context. He bounces off the other characters so well, his rapport with everyone he interacts with is superb, especially WW. I thought he was fantastic right to the last. I'm not familiar with the comics, so although I'm aware Steve is something of a constant in Wonder Woman, I didn't know his fate. His end felt moving, and those feelings felt earned. I think it's a shame we're unlikely to see him again. (although it is a comic book movie, so what do I know?)

As for the rest of the film?  
The No Man's Land scene was, in a word, epic. It left me dumbstruck. It looked incredible. Chills up my spine for most of it, and when the men finally all clamber out of the trench to charge across was perhaps the frisson inducing moment of the movie.  
Shortly thereafter, the slow motion fight in the buildings afterwards, were the best. Almost unbelievably better than the fighting on Themisthingy. The slow motion worked *really* fucking well. The moment she kicked the table and her theme kicked in put a massive grin on my face.  
Have I mentioned the slow-mo? I'll mention it again. I'm struggling to remember a film where such filming has come off quite so well. Nothing looked out of place, with more time to expose each moment to scrutiny it gave nothing back.

Chase on horses was cool, the gala was a beautiful set piece and I enjoyed the dialogue throughout. The howling commandos were great, and I was thrilled none of them died. Sure, they felt slightly underdeveloped, but that gets a pass considering how little screen time they have compared to others. I call them Howling Commandos because I'm unoriginal, but the comparison seems kind of apt in the context of the film, especially when the comparisons to Cap1 got almost comedic with the appearance of the great big, very bad plane used for bombing. Was dealt with differently, so I'm not bothered. It's slightly amusing, if nothing else, and not something I'd actually hold against the film. The costuming in general was amazing. Dr. Poison looked wonderfully sinister, the uniforms were all top notch, and Gal Gadot looked bloody marvelous in the proper outfit. And that blue dress, too.  
Cinematography was pretty sweet too. A few off moments, but the framing and colouring of so many shots was downright breathtaking.  
My only other really big complaint is again CGI related, and comes in the final fight. There are a few moments at the airfield where WW just looks a bit removed from where she should be when walking along the fiery ground. Otherwise, most of the rest of that was pretty cool. 

The two book ends, Diana in Paris, were alright, although not particularly necessary. Liked the start, better than the end, but w/e, doesn't matter, great film.

In context of the DCEU (DCCU?)?  
I thought Suicide Squad was shit, and after the trailer I was so disappointed. The worst thing it did though was be boring.  
I recognise *a lot* of the faults in Batman vs Superman, but I still generally like most of the film. I suppose in much the same way I still like that not-Godzilla Godzilla movie from the end of the 90s. Most of all though, Wonder Woman left me thinking that I wish they'd held off on this until after Wonder Woman and a stand-alone Batfleck movie.  
And I both love Man of Steel and think it's a decent flick.

Wonder Woman probably needs another watch, maybe one where I'm 20 or so minutes late to the cinema, but I think it's easily the strongest of their films yet. Would be thrilled to see more DC films of this calibre.

The No mans land slow mo walk in particularly did not completely work and I was taken out of the epicness of the movie to know I was being pandered to. I feel like someone will edit that walk with the [Fight song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8qDOGLCSFo) lyrics at some point either ironically, or unironically.

The movie was great because I didn't feel like I was being bashed over the head with propaganda trying to teach me to respect women the entire time. I was respecting Wonder woman because she was was amazing, her gender was just a side element which is exactly who and how wonder woman should be portrayed.

That moment though seemed to be sub par, and could have been tweaked a little to represent her resolve and character, and less whatever they were going for there. 

The [god killer sword](#spoiler) was not subtle at all. Though it did not ruin it for me, but it would have been nice to have properly tried to build up that plot element, if they were going to try it.

I super appreciated the art style they used to demonstrate the lore. That was well done and beautiful.

On another note, i felt that the concept of her being a complete outsider to the war and the politics of the great war could have been more interesting if she had been fighting from the german side against the British, just to make things more complex  ",6erigc

Brilliant acting by Pine and Thewlis. While I was dubious about Gadot's acting before, (and I'm still not certain she's that good outside of Wonder Woman) I feel like she absolutely *owned* the role. It was critical that she nailed it not just for a plethora of reasons and she absolutely did. She nailed the sadness, the anger, the desire to help others and the pain that you feel when you can't, and the humility that comes with dealing with failure. Oh man just great. 

The writing was top notch, the fight sequences were all good. No Man's Land obviously stands out key amongst fight scenes for me in just the short history of comic book movies. It's not the best ever, but it is definitely one of the best. The directing was every bit as good as you've heard. ",6erigc

Great action, although others are right when they say the best action sequence was in the middle of the movie and the last act did drag on slightly. IMO those things are minor, the last action scenes was still cool, just not as cool as ""no man's land"". Gal Gadot is BANGING and a good actress to boot. Chris Pine is a big enough draw to be a DC hero himself, but they made him a great supporting character so props to the casting director on that. All in all, fun movie.

Did he or did he not want the armistice? Or did he not care? 

1. Say he wanted the armistice. He seems to say that's his plan. That it'll create more conflict down the line (to oversimplify - WWII happened because of the treaty that ended WWI)

2. Then his push as a politician for the armistice makes sense

3. However what's not clear is why he would give Dr. Poison and the German dude the super gas. The armistice would have been signed if that didn't happen. I know he doesn't control them outright so... Was this a fuck up?

4. What happens at the end? Well i guess the armistice is signed, just as happened IRL, which led to the treaty of Paris and then WWII. If that's the case, did Wonder Woman run into a trap in a rather foolish way? ",6erigc

All the action sequences are perfectly cut together (I personally thought the abundant slow-mo was used effectively), and that opening sequence with the gods fighting was visually stunning. They really made Wonder Woman/Diana's powers feel *powerful*, and I think a lot of superhero movies have forgotten how to do that lately.

I think the hoopla over this being a ""feminist"" movie is overblown (the people complaining probably have deeper insecurities about themselves and women, imo).

dicol7n,"In terms of story and pacing this movie was a step up compared to DC's latest films: BvS and Suicide Squad. The flow was pretty good and the pacing of the first and second act was on point. The third act dragged a bit though but thats fine. 

However overall I say that BvS and Man of Steel are the better films. The reason being is that Wonder Woman had little pay off for me. There was never that ""wow"" or ""oh shit here we go!"" moment. And this was mainly due to the mediocre fight scenes. During fights the movie loved to jump around with quick cuts to the point that I literally had no idea wtf was happening at certain points and it seems like Diana was teleporting around the room. Add in all the slomo and it was kinda hard to watch for me.

I know this sub hates BvS but that movie got the action scenes down pat. The action was always on center, the fights were easy to follow and it was well choreographed. Znyder's superhero flicks has some of the best fight scenes between Marvel and the DCEU. And imo the fight scenes are like 50% of what I care about in a comic book film if not more. Everything else kinda exists solely to get the heroes kickin the shit out of the bad guys. 

there was never a ""Batman fights a bunch of dudes in a warehouse"" or ""superman vs two krypton soldiers"" moment in Wonder Woman and its a shame cuz it would have made the movie a 9/10 for me.

The movie was still pretty good though.

dicpql6,"Overall good film and fantastic casting of the main pair, but I was really bothered by how the war and the Germans were handled. 
For a movie who's message is supposed to be ""war is bad"" there was an awful lot of glorifying the protagonists slaughter of ""the bad guys""(actual line in the movie).

I mean the German soldiers in the trenches are probably guilty of a lot less than spy, assassin, and (attempted) seductionist Pine, but he's the Hero and they're the evil Germans so I guess it's ok.

Also Diana's ""I'm not"" to Steve's ""we're all to blame"" rubbed me the wrong way; I mean, she just killed about a hundred people *on her first day*, I'd say that's pretty culpable. 

I enjoyed the show, and it was probably marketed to be a little cleaner for a broader audience, but those parts bothered me.",6erigc

dih7kft,"I loved the theme of this movie. It's interesting to see someone realize that the world is not a simple and just place.

Wouldn't life be so much simpler to understand if we could blame all of our worst tendencies on a god or some external force? It's a powerful message  that gave the character an interesting arc. 

It's too bad it concluded in CGI nightmare schlock. I wish comic book movies would scale things back a bit when it comes to their climax. But you got to have the gig dumb ending with people throwing trucks at each other.

I can also tell that Rupert takes a lot of inspiration from his brother since some of these cues wouldn't sound out of place as alternates to Prince Caspian cues. No Man's Land around the 5 minute mark builds in such a similar way and the way the string section is arranged sounds very similar to the way Harry writes his string sections. ",6erigc

That's about my only critique, though. Everything else is heartwarming and sincere. I think that's the simplest summary I can think of the movie--it was sincere. Diana was sincere in every scene. I could feel actual emotions trying to come through the screen rather than being told about emotions.

Also, Diana's fighting style. Some of the action scenes can be off or weird (not expert enough to say why I think so), and slow-mo can be hit or miss, but I love the way they brought her fighting style to life.

Gal Gadots acting was pretty good in this one. A step up from her fast and furious days. Her character was written good, I liked how naive they made her look and how she kept questioning things.

Overall the movie was great definitely the forerunner in the DC universe. The only problem I had was the third act, the climax with Diana professing that love was the motivation for her to overcome it all seemed off. For me, I always thought Wonder Woman was a character that didn't need a reason beyond enjoying the thrill of the fight. The fight itself was motivation enough. The fact that she needed love, especially a man's love seemed out of character. Is that just me? I didn't read enough of the comics, but that really was the main fault for me personally.

dim7fb3,"Overall, I really enjoyed the flick. Brought something fresh and uplifting to the DCEU that it sorely needed. Still a number of sore points, but it didn't really affect the overall enjoyment of the film. 

I am disappointed with the villains.Danny huston got used as a generic villain again and David Thewlis got the general villain ""twist"" that pretty much came out of nowhere. I get that they needed Ares to come out and fight Diana, but having it be the good guy general kinda just popped up with not much alluding to him.

Loved the action pieces for the most part. Well choreographed and I do love me some sword and shield fighting. Just disappointed with the overuse of Slow mo. It makes sense to have in the beginning as she acclimates to her god powers and then here and there for impact (like no man's land). But I'm pretty sure they used it in almost every single action sequence/scene. It was just not necessary. That and the generic CGI god battle at the end kinda reminded me of the end of BvS. Fun concept, but just didn't really work for me. 

As stated, really did enjoy the film. A ton more than BvS and Suicide squad. I put my enjoyment of it up there with Man of Steel (which i really enjoyed).

It had a rough start I will admit. It would have been better if they skipped at least one of Diana's age skips. One with child Diana and current Diana would have been perfect.

But the second the action starts the movie just hits all of those perfects. I was actually brought to tears in the theater watching her walking through the trenches and running straight through No Man's Land. The power of that scene was intense.

Guardians of the Galaxy was lucky to be released before this, because this would have absolutely blown that away.

Some of the ADR moments were pitifully recorded. It'd sound as if someone was right on the screen vs. being in proper dimension of space.

The story itself was just too easy. RAISE THE STAKES!

Geezus christ on a cracker, there are so many problems I don't even know where to begin.  The plot languishes, it's overly long, much of it makes little to no sense.  The battles are partially a rip of 300, CGI, or just zzz.  

I figured I'd spot it 15 percentage points for having a female lead, but wow.  It's realistically a 50 or 55% on RT, so apparently they set the bar REAAAAAALLY low.  92%, what a disgrace.

- Germans are the bad guys again, except it's world war 1
- A rag tag of misfits has to go behind enemy lines
- The super hero is the best of humanity, but this time, it's a woman!!
- One German has super human strength!
- The weapon of mass destruction is...a plane, but this time, they are going to destroy London, not New York! Yay!
- A guy name Steve, played by actor called Chris, sacrifices himself...on plane....again

**Let's start with the bad:**

- Pacing: it is way off. Suffers from some extreme slow down in some areas. Also, it never really ramps up the pace - it just seems to be content at a very...'meh' pace. No real appreciable difference between 2nd and 3rd Acts (which explains the lack of a crescendo)

- Very rushed Ending : So, she kills Ares, some Germans take off their masks, she goes back to London, looks at a picture, then the movie flash forwards to the present, she sends a mail to batman saying thank you and then she jumps off the Louvre to, I dunno, some boat in the space of about 5 minutes. Wonderful way to end the movie....which leads me to....

- Unresolved plot points : So, we are supposed to forget about the island? Her mum? The Amazonians? If they could destroy a factory FULL of the gas and only be about 10 metres away from the factory, why couldn't they just blow up the plane from the other side of the runway with one stick of dynamite - oh wait I forgot, a Steve needs to die on a plane.

- Gal Gadot : She is probably the most beautiful woman on the planet, but she's not that great of an actress unfortunately....BUT she does look like Wonder Woman a lot...even if she does over do that crouched-turn head-frown-then charge move.
No after credit scene : Minor but it really does help with Marvel hype. I don't know why DC doesn't do it.

- A bit too much of the Jesus motifs

- Too similar to Cap A's film

**The good :**

- Certain fight scenes are really good. Like storming the village - Gal Gadot can fight!

- Gal Gadot : Despite what I said earlier, you'll never tire of watching her.

- The humour : It's trying too hard but meh, it kinda worked....

- Orgins : It helped explain Wonder Woman's origin and met that objective

- I'd say it's probably the best DC film so far but still lagging far behind marvel's efforts.",6erigc

Please stop forcing Christian symbolism into every DC movie. It just does not work. A Christ air in Man of Steel was fine. Having Superman do it again, sure. Putting it in Wonder Woman was too much.

The Themiscyra stuff was on point up until they bail on half her origin. The ""competition"" scene was weak and Diana would never have stolen the WW gear from her people. She should have won it fair and square.

Yeah, yeah, it would have been attacked as 'too hunger games' or something.

The London stuff for the most part was just awful. We didn't need the ""lets try on clothes"" bit and the humor all felt soul-less and forced. Like the studio memo came through reading ""other films too serious, insert teh funny here."" It didn't work.

Deliver the book, introduce the mysterious benefactor and the support team and move along to Europe.

The war stuff was fine for what it was. It felt a little too cut and paste from the Howling Commandos down to a blond hero named Steve going down in a giant plane.

There were some key problems with the villain:

Zeus attacked him and weakened him with lightning, right? So how is it that he's able to weild Zeus' lightning? Either it damages him or he can handle it freely, he shouldn't be able to do both.

That same ability Diana also has? All Children of Zeus maybe? Dunno, it's not explained.

But my real problem is this:

If Ares is the instigator of war, and killing him miraculously makes everyone brothers again... how do they explain WWII in this universe? Did it just not happen? Was the the war to end all wars? That was really my only problem with the WWI setting.

didjppm,"As a Scotsman, Feminist, Obsessive Comic Book Nerd, and Self-Declared Movie Buff, I HATED Wonder Woman.

Let’s get the affront to my Celtic pride out of the way first. In WW, there is a character named Charlie a stereotypical drunk Scot sniper who can no longer shoot straight. He wears a kilt…and if you know anything about the Scots and their kilts, you know that what a Scotsman wears under his kilt is a bit of a cultural secret…mostly a joke, but one we take a bit of pride in keeping. Yet, in this movie, there is a scene where Charlie clearly displays what he is packing, and it can only be described as some 1920’s version of a pair of Depends. I was stunned, shocked, and outraged…in a mostly joking way…but it was still an affront that just made no sense. And yeah, that probably put me in a bad mood for the rest of the film.

As a feminist, this movie is an insult to women. Yeah, she’s strong (more on that below) and smart (she reads and speaks every(?) human language (both ancient and modern) and understands organic chemistry well enough to, at a glance, know that a formula is for a hydrogen based (instead of sulfur based) mustard gas), yet she is so unbelievably naive that she can’t understand the need for modesty in a foreign land and thinks a street vendor’s ice cream is some unbelievably heavenly concoction. She is a child in Steve Trevor’s world, and even though she can take care of herself, she is incomplete without him…and his love.

On top of that, she simply isn’t REAL. She has no flaws (other than her oh so adorable naiveté). She has no weaknesses. She has never had a real struggle in her life. She is flat, wooden, one-dimensional…and not even in that Boy Scout Do Gooder way that Captain America pulls off so well. She doesn’t struggle with ANYTHING a real woman (or real person) struggles with. She is as much of a feminist icon as the fembots from Austin Powers.

Then there are the Amazons. Aside from lacking any humanity, they also lack anything remotely approaching a feminist ideal. The little we see of them underscores their masculine attributes (their constant martial training, for example) and act like they all would have felt quite comfy in Sparta. What made them any better than the “man’s world”? Other than as a male fantasy island, what was the point of it at all?

Then there is the love story…it completely and totally failed for me, because I couldn’t find any reason for Steve Trevor to fall in love with Diana, other than the fact that she is hot. Again, she is incredibly smart, but in a sterile book smart kind of way that shows no ability to understand subtlety or emotion. She shows nothing in this movie that engenders any kind of emotional reaction. I kind of compare it to Star-Lord and Gammora from Guardians of the Galaxy. Their “love story” is incredibly complex and nuanced…you buy it because you actually fall in love with the characters themselves before they fall in love with each other. In Wonder Woman, we are given no time (or reason) to love Diana other than as a sex-object.

Then there is the simple fact that the only characters who get any depth or character development are the men…in one line about how his desire to be an actor was thwarted by his skin color, Samir, the Moroccan con-man, gets more character development and sympathetic emotional response than ANYTHING Diana does in the entire movie. Diana’s ONLY character development is that she now believes in LOVE! No, seriously. Bottom line, this was THE STEVE TREVOR MOVIE (featuring Wonder Woman). Cut the film so it starts at his introduction and ends with his death, and you would have a much better film…yeah, it’s not a Wonder Woman film, but given what this film actually is, that would certainly be for the better.

As a huge fan of comic book movies, it is clear that the writers of this film have no idea what it is comic book fans love about comic books. Because Diana’s powers are completely undefined and (apparently) with out limit, none of her fights have any stakes at all. She is, essentially, One Punch Man without any of the nuance or understanding of how that actually impacts the comic book narrative. She is able to do whatever she needs to do at the time, without any real training (or failure). The final boss battle is entirely meaningless, because we have no idea what the limits, weaknesses, or even primary powers are of the two combatants. There is no lore or training montage…there is no “Checkov’s Lightning Bolt” that let’s us know how, although against great odds, our hero will win the day. It’s just a couple of computer generated CGI screen savers smacking up against each other in full IMAX 3D. I was entirely disinterested.

As contrast, take how the final boss fight was handled in Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2. The themes and even plot points are incredibly similar. Two “gods” with unknown and perhaps even limitless power fight for the fate of the “world”. One is rather new to the whole god thing and does not understand their abilities or how to use them. Through the power of love, the newer “god” overcomes the older one and saves the day. In one movie, the emotions are real and earned, and although we don’t understand the power, we believe it and the mechanics are irrelevant to the struggle. In the other, the emotion is trite and not believable, we always know the hero is gonna win, and how they get there becomes boring, mechanical and utterly meaningless.

Finally, as a fan of movies in general, this film had so many technical issues. Pacing and tone are entirely inconsistent. The flip from a very novel and interesting use of sub-titles to Chris Pine’s horrible German accent when he is speaking German (instead of subtitled German) was jarring and just bizarre. There was WAAAAAAAYYYYY TOOOOOOOOO MUUUUUUUUUUUCH SLOOOOOOOW MOOOOOTION action. It was too long by a good 30 minutes. And they wasted much of the potential it had with cheap comedic shots. Sadly, the best parts of this movie were actually in the trailer.

dj5nb8p,"I saw this last night, and I think it may have convinced me to give up seeing movies in theaters unless I have a great reason to do so.

I spent $11. The theater was full of kids, the projection wasn't the greatest. Okay, not deal breakers as long as the movie is good.

The movie is not good. Gawd, it was boring. Poorly directed (nothing new or original, the ""anti-Edgar Wright""), poor acting (who is Gal Gadot, and when will she take acting lessons?), and fight scenes that were so over-the-top that it was obvious when they'd completely replaced Gadot with animation.

In fact, the action sequences were so crazy that they were boring. I've decided that if such a scene is rendered in a way that it is obvious that there is much digital trickery involved, I'm just not interested. It's much more interesting if the action is scaled down, as if it actually happened in front of a camera. I'd rather see clever direction than something that clearly didn't happen outside a computer.

There were so many things that were set up and never paid off, or paid off in such a way that I just didn't care. A number of extremely shallow characters were added strictly for comic relief and given attributes that were never used, and backstories that were paper thin.

There was nothing new or original here.

I've learned that I can't trust Rotten Tomatoes anymore. I've seen a couple of films recently that got scores of 90% or better that were just deadly dull or awful. The fact that this one gets 92% just kills off any credibility that RT had.

There is so much great original TV content on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and HBO for $10-15/month that I don't know why I'd spend money on a theater experience again, unless it's for a truly amazing movie. Right now I can't imagine what that movie might be, as there's really nothing out in theaters now that grabs me. Most things are sequels to other movies that don't interest me all that much. (Yes, I'll likely go see Bladerunner, but... I'm afraid. Oh, so afraid...)

Maybe my standards are too high. Maybe I'm just getting really old. Maybe I'm completely out of touch. I don't understand why this movie is getting the reviews that it is, and I can't believe I got suckered into seeing it. It may be the movie that convinced me not to go to theaters again, or at least not more than once or maybe twice a year. Feature films are just dreck right now.",6erigc

* Ares should not have been in the movie. He randomly appears at the end as a character we only briefly saw from the beginning. There was a really good idea in the film about how the evils of man are not caused by one being, but they totally threw that out the window with Ares appearing. They should have just made the fight scene with that general bigger if they wanted a big fireworks show at the end. Make it so that WW learns that there's no big villain who she can kill to save the world, but that the world has to be saved day by day. It's an endless and exhausting mission.

&nbsp;

* Some of the sets looked like they came out of a play. Especially the one where they save some French village and all the villagers came out to rejoice. That was so cheesy and ridiculous both in style and substance. 

&nbsp;

* Speaking of cheesy. At the end, ""love"" saves the world? WW is suppose to be a strong warrior badass, not sailor moon. And it really didn't look like love except in words. It looked like she was mad pissed because Chris Pine died and she wanted revenge. Revenge saves the world? 

&nbsp;

* I have to talk about Gal Gadot as WW. I know everyone loves her, and she seemed fine in BvS, but all the Amazons on the island looked and acted more like warriors than she does the whole film. She needed to get really fit looking to sell me her as WW, and she didn't. She looked like a model with weak arms who can't hold up her shield and has no skill with a sword. She doesn't need to get huge, but she needs more tone and definition. Her movements are just so frail looking. She also doesn't seem to have much range. I want to see her be fierce and powerful. Instead she looked like she was getting ready for a picnic most of the time. Actually there was a scene where she looked like she was going to act with authority, in the meeting room with the generals. She should have pulled out her sword and threatened to kill them for cowardice like a warrior, instead she gets hustled out the room like a whiny secretary.

&nbsp;

* One of the scenes in particular didn't make any sense, and it was at the beginning when the Amazons were fighting the Germans in boats coming to invade on shore. Why did they come down from their high ground, where they could shoot arrows at the invaders below with little danger to themselves, and instead come down to fight hand-to-hand? That was absolutely senseless. It seems the Amazons practice pointless acrobatics, like how to grab something from the ground while riding a horse, and spinning like a helicopter to fight people, instead of training to fight as a united front using shields and formations and tactics. Shooting from a horse while riding is a huge advantage, but only in an open field where you can stay at the edges and can't be hit by the enemy, not riding INTO the enemy.

&nbsp;

* Too many characters. This story is suppose to be about WW right? It seemed like Chris Pine got just as much screen time. Who is he? I don't care about him. Tell me a story about WW, not some random dude. It seems like the movie is telling me that even WW needs a man to lead her and motivate her to be all she can be? Seems like the thinking from this movie is in the same era as its setting. Who were the other people in the band of misfits? They were pointless.

&nbsp;

All in all this movie was comically disorganized, completely nonsensically written, looked cheap, and worst of all was incredibly boooring, especially in the middle. I'm glad I got that off my chest, now to never think of speak of this god awful mess EVER!

I left after the first 40 minutes. This was one of the worst heaping piles of hot garbage I've ever seen released from a major studio. Every single thing about this movie was not just bad, but fucking abysmal. Gadots acting was cringe-worthy... Action scenes were laughable. Dialogue was so horrible. Patty Jenkins was way in over her head trying to make this kind of movie. It was literally direct to DVD bargain bin tier. It felt like I was watching a college students project with 150 million dollar budget.  I couldn't take it anymore and had to leave.

Now that I've seen some leaks of the final scene, I'm glad I did.  This was without question the worst movie I've ever seen.

And before you blame it on the ""message"" of the movie... The ""message"" was actually the only thing I did like from what I saw. I wanted to enjoy the story, but everything was so awfully executed I couldn't even begin to enjoy it.

This movie starts off with Diana reminiscing about her 5-year-old self. She wants to train in fighting and even [spoiler text here](#spoilers ""recklessly jumped off a ledge."")

Later, the movie time-skips to a pre-teen Diana in disbelief about what she's supposed to be doing.

I dislike dramas and not that big on war films so that's three things this movie has that I don't like. The action was too fast for my brain to handle (I don't know what they put in those scenes to make it hard to keep up with) This movie had too much crying and sadness from people in it for me. Even an annoying baby crying voice. The melodrama this movie had made me cringe and get nervous and this is the first film I walked out on. I don't like wasting money on movies but mommy and a therapist told me if a movie starts to make me nervous, I can leave.

This is the worst movie so far that I've seen in 2017 and that's saying a lot since Snatched could be considered the worst from the general public but I don't know Amy Schummer enough, nor do I have a disdain for her to hate it like other people do.

I figured the moments with the lasso of truth could be explained away as him just talking around the truth instead of outright lying. And I thought it could really cement the thesis the film was going for, if the first decent man Diana comes across turns out to be evil, it'd give her an enormous crisis of faith which is something she could work to overcoming in the final fight.

3. There was no reason to have Chris Pine as a [romantic interest](#spoiler) - to me it just cheapened the story and added crappy filler plots where the story dragged. 

4. Did the movie REALLY need stress how beautiful she is the entire time? Since this is supposed to be about a woman kicking ass and being equal to the male super heroes, why were her looks brought up constantly? Nobody ever looks at Superman and talks about his looks first over him saving the world. 

5. WAY TOO MUCH SLO-MO JESUS CHILL OUT.

I lost attention so many times.

My key problems:
- WW is supposed to be a part of the triad of chief JL member's, BM and SM have music that is amazingly iconic and classic in its composition and themes. They fill the gaps of the screen like water filling a cup. WW has such abrasive themes and music, is basically screaming at you ""Hey im culturally different from you all (BM and SM) and in kick ass""... like is just jarring and pulls me out of the story.
- the story was just obvious, I knew what was going to happen from like the first act. The guy she thinks is the bad guy isnt, she questions her mission, she learns ablut her secret power, battle with the enemy hidden right infront of her the whole time. It just doesnt feel original or unique.
- what is the deal with all the slow motion fight scenes. MoS had a really great demonstration of how SM and other enhanced beings are that much more deadly then normal people by showing them move at ""real time"". It made for a sincere and unique perspective to show his character. It feels like we needed slow motio  WW to show off her sick body but like that just reaches a point where its a gimmick and it kinda patronizies the notions of feminism in the film.
- who is she narorating the film too? Like is she writing an email to Bruce telling this story? This history she has tried to conceal based on the hunt for the original picture? Like  she is going to email it and not tell him in person? I dont get it. The naroration seemed so out of place and 3rd wall breaky, DC is aiming for darker tones yet they break the 3rd wall which although is not inherently light hearted, does lead to a dissection from gravity and being encompassed in a dramatic scene.

That scene and her telling off the whole room of old white male leaders for not fighting with their people were excellent in building up her character.

It's kind of the same thing Snyder did with Batman, [he kills people on camera](https://youtu.be/GgkQS7q6sT0?t=41).  But the movie seems to want you to think they just got *really* hurt but they're not dead.

She doesn't cut anyone with the sword, just beats them with her shield, fists, and legs. No one takes a hit that it isn't reasonable to assume they'd survive, albeit with injuries.

In fact through the whole movie, she only kills ***maybe 5 people*** apart from Ludendorff. She slashes at two guards while riding into the base (likely killed, if not seriously wounded), she throws two men off a guard tower (they could have survived), and the sniper that she brought the steeple down on (it's possible he survived too).

The point is, she isn't savagely killing anyone in her path with disdain or indifference. The two guards she slashed at, she was angry, distressed and ridding against time to stop Aries from shipping the gas.        ",6erigc

SynopsisJemma strikes again.",6erigc
dicullv,"Overall it felt like a fine movie, but I do think they could have made Steve's warnings more meaningful and improved the movie overall. Like, instead of it just being him being unfamiliar of how badass she is, it could be shown that he has a better feel for how the world (or at least this Man's world) works than she does in her idealism. Diana's character arc could have been polished up with a character flaw of impulsively taking well meaning action often, but sometimes making things worse rather than only imrpoved due to her naïveté and lack of experience/practical knowledge. So he warns her not to go into No Man's Land and help Vend. She does anyway, liberates the town, and people are happy as shown already. Just throw in a little dialog where he points out that he's happy the people are free now, but that he hopes they can end the war soon since the people are now targets on the front line. Makes the brutal gassing of the town more devastating since it echoes his previous warning and how he wanted to focus on finding the gas instead of killing the German general.


It would go a long way to explaining why she stayed out of the public eye after WWI and did not get involved again until the BvS conflict; she felt she needed to spend time learning about the world so as to not make bad situations worse. A different big change could have been that killing the German commander actually did make the war worse, and prolong the fighting another few months. That would be a sufficiently shocking result compared to her expectations that it would explain her backing away from the world. It could have been part of an intricate plot by Ares if you want to spin it that way, and you could still have her battle him, but make it clear she wins a temporary victory (since we know WW2 happens anyway, and that she didn't get involved there). 


As it was, despite the repeated warnings not to go after the German commander, there's really little of consequence that happens when she kills him. He might as well have been any other nameless mook, just one with access to super steroids. She learns a little more of human nature in that it's not as simple as killing one guy to stop a war perhaps, but it's still sort of implied that the war does end in part when she defeats Ares. He does say that he set up the armistice that wouldn't be followed, so I suppose you can chalk up WW2 to posthumous plans if you don't want an active Ares at that point.

On a side note, the mustache made it sort of hard for me to personally take Ares seriously. I kinda hoped all the hair on his head would have burned away so that he was bald or something during the fight. ",6erigc

The idea of her stepping out there, into the horror of WWI trench warfare, and being unwilling to let that stop her from fixing the problem she saw in front of her... it was shockingly powerful for me. And I think I found it very sad because all I could think was, ""God damn, it's so horrible that no one ever could do that in history."" If that makes any sense.

I dunno—it was like it brought the injustice and horror of war into such a stark contrast with the idea of someone being powerful and good enough to step in and stop it. (Or at least one tiny part of it.) I guess you could say it spoke to the idealist in me and I totally wasn't expecting that.

And regardless it would have only taken one or two short establishing scenes to help illuminate his motivations.  He should have been more like MCU Zemo with actual reasons; it would have fit better with the themes of the flaws of man and individual lives and choices.  Instead it was more like they were shooting for a watch-the-world-burn kind of character, but without the writing or performance to support it like in TDK.

difr0om,"How are all of those great? The CGI was subpar and looked jerky/not good m in a lot of scenes. Fighting was average if not subpar to other comic book movies and less frequent considering the length of the movie. The writing was cheesy, and the comedic scenes are not in any way original; all been done before. The story was really drawn out and had flaws. Also by having 3 weak villains, none of the villains felt really interesting or justified. Even the final fight wasn't good, it was Diana getting thrown and then all of a sudden coming into full realization (randomly) of her powers as a god.  Nothing in this movie, except for a female lead character was groundbreaking or new (and don't get me wrong, I think that's a great and cool accomplishment; gal did a good job acting). 


This piece was trying to be socially conscience, but they played into common stereotypes of black women, Native Americans, Irish, and Middle Easterners, and why the hell was a Native American in a World War 1 movie lol. I feel like that' wasn't a very common occurrence. He was there the whole time just for that one line about American's taking Native land. They could have conveyed the theme he attempted to convene in so many more effective and realistic ways. There was really only one instance where I felt like Diana took a strong stance for feminism against male oppression, and that was in the war room where she stood up to the men and looked like she belonged there instead of just confused. 


God and the ending with the quote about love just hurt. I didn't get that message at all from the movie; the relationship was a 5-7 day fling with 2 really weird and forced conversations about sex and a supposed sex scene. They were only a couple for like 2 days lol",6erigc
dihbhhc,"Even that, I was kinda okay with? Since it was still done in a manner that was heavily character-based for Diana, it wasn't all just mindless noise like the climax of MOS or BvS, and Ares' rants are crucial to the film's theme and message. This movie in general succeeded in every way that MOS stumbles, especially with having a big, epic one-on-one climactic fight that forces the hero to make a difficult moral choice. ",6erigc
dii49ll,"He didn't have your typical cookie cutter ambitions though. He just had a differing view. He wasn't the ""take over the world"" type, or a god of war just wanting war, he genuinely thought Zeus' creation was evil, and he thought he was ridding the world of a bad thing. I loved it when he was just like, ""they're doing this all on their own"" and Diana almost gave in there. You could see the horror on her face. She had been struggling with the concept that mankind might actually have evil in them that's not the fault of Ares, and up until that point, she had been trying to deny it, but that's when it set in. He was evil, but in a ""kill one person to save nine"" kind of way. ",6erigc

I came out feeling a sense of loss and sadness, but at the same time had this wondrous feeling of hope. I think that is largely to do with the fact that Patty allowed us to experience the gravity of the situation and the horrific aspects of The War through Diana's exposure and loss of innocence, rather than through beating the audience over the head with violence and shock-horror action (not that there's anything wrong with that I just think that this was the right direction to take for this film).",6erigc

The first time they did it I was gearing up to be annoyed, but it was done perfectly. I loved it and felt it really enhances the action sequences, which is rare. I was beyond impressed with how the movie was directed, Jenkins did a superb job. I hope the box office reflects this because maybe then WB will butt out and let the people who have vision for their movies actually fulfill them without secondary input/demands. ",6erigc

dicndfm,"""I'M NO MAN!!""

Dude, show, don't tell. ",6erigc
dihjfjp,"The ""No man am I"" line from the LOTR books was also Tolkien's own subversion of Shakespeare. In Macbeth, the king is told by an apparition that ""no man born of woman"" can kill him, so he thinks himself safe. His eventual killer was born by caesarean section, thus not technically ""born of woman"". 

I suspect Tolkien thought the Macbeth prophecy was too much of a technicality, and wrote Eowyn partially as a subversion of that same prophecy but in a much more direct manner. 

The dialogue in the book is better, though I suspect you'd still have the same reaction, since the gist is still the same, and the movie reveal wasn't great. Theoden charges down the Fields of the Pelennor, and the Witch-King turns from Minas Tirith to intercept him. Theoden's horse falls to a dart, and crushes the king underneath him. As the Witch-King gets ready to kill Theoden, Eowyn steps in his way:

Éowyn: Be gone, foul dwimmerlaik, lord of carrion! Leave the dead in peace!

Nazgûl: Come not between the Nazgul and his prey! Or he will not slay thee in thy turn. He will bear thee away to the houses of lamentation, beyond all darkness, where thy flesh shall be devoured, and thy shriveled mind be left naked to the Lidless Eye.

Éowyn: Do what you will, but I will hinder it, if I may.

Nazgûl: Hinder me? Thou fool. No living man may hinder me!

Éowyn: But no living man am I! You look upon a woman. Éowyn I am, Eomund's daughter. You stand between me and my lord and kin. Be gone, if you be not deathless! For living or dark undead, I will smite you, if you touch him.",6erigc

Maybe a little bit in the bar scene when they realize what she's capable of, but they don't really dwell on it and move on quickly.

In this movie, Wonder Woman beats Ares, but she doesn't take into account his back up plan, which ends up leading to the even worse WW2 twenty years later.  It really hammers home how good of a strategist Ares is that he engineered an even larger conflict through an armistice.

It also shows the duality of human nature as well.  WW2 saw the use of the deadliest weapon ever invented by man; the nuclear bomb.  It shows that we do have evil in us.  However, since WW2, no one has used a nuke after seeing the sheer devastation the prototype for the perfected bomb wrought (except for against Doomsday, but desperate times, right?) on a country and it's people, even after the initial explosion.

But that would've felt like a cop out excuse to have a boss fight. Instead, they cleverly explain exactly what Wonder Woman is, her true origin and purpose. And it worked. As a fan of both the classic origin and the New 52 origin, it was nice having this amalgam of both stories to give us something unique. The gods are dead.

Also, Gadot nailed the role. She was believable in everything. The naivete, the action, the emotion. She knocked it all out of the park. She is to Diana what RDJ is to Tony Stark. ",6erigc
dicnh38,"Gonna ride this comment because it expressed exactly how I feel about it.

Great movie. At least the first 2/3rd's. The final act does fall flat for me. The God of War just throws shit at her and then uses lightning when that's Zeus's thing. I was a little confused but nonetheless enjoyed the movie.

I think you're right though. Having no Ares at all would make this a better movie. Ares is alive. He's an idea and thats why war happens.

I think the random tag alongs weren't too useful. The only useful one was the guy who snuck them into the Gala.

Was very happy they actually killed Steve. Very surprised.

I love Gal Gadot. She fucking killed it as Wonder Woman. If they can do a Batman movie at the same caliber and get them together I'll lose it.",6erigc
die4m7d,"Good points, and I respect your opinion BUT: I disagree about the ending. In the end, this IS a super hero movie and the story was showing the need for a super hero, not just anyone. Without the Ares fight you don't get Steve's sacrifice and that loss for Diana. This loss places her among Clark and Bruce, losing a loved one that reinforces her purpose of good vs. evil. Additionally, the death of the German general was so anticlimactic—ending it there wouldn't have felt like a full circle on the story. If she simply learned man was still capable of evil without a clear force present like Ares, then we don't see her development to decide it's her CHOICE to fight evil for the sake of man. Lastly, her powers were tested by Ares and finally put her training to its ultimate test, including her force power that seems she only had a subconscious control of in the beginning. ",6erigc

dicneiu,"I thought they might not do Ares, considering how they presented WW in BvS.

In BvS she's trying to hide almost, and she seems to be hesitant to get involved in the big fight. She's just trying to get her picture back.

I thought, if they did it like you suggest, where she kills the guy and that's it, there's still war, that would explain why she was just trying to hide out. She's just kind of broken.

I thought this would fit into Synder's bleak universe pretty well.

Playing Injustice, WW is pretty much the reason Superman turns evil, so I was thinking about that watching the movie.

I thought, what if killing the general and nothing happening turns WW a little evil, and we end up with a story similar to what happens in Injustice later on in the movie universe.

I was happy with how it turned out though. Ares reminded me of Al Pacino in Devil's advocate, his role in the world anyway.",6erigc

Presumably Steve would have still succeeded in taking out the gas plane in a blaze of glory, but all the other guys would have gotten killed.

And then the boss battle IMHO was a bit cringey. And I actually didn't like David Thewlis as Ares. It was almost comic relief in that flashback scene of him as a ripped god of war with his David Thewlis face. Sort of thought they should've cast someone younger.

I found myself wishing that killing Ares had no visible affect on the soldiers at the end. I don't think I'd want to go as dark as killing off the chief, actor, and singer. But it would make for a good critique on the nature of humans and why Diana was essentially in hiding until Bruce Wayne convinced her otherwise. It would've made Batman's move convincing Wonder Woman to return even more impressive.

Plus it explains why just twenty years after Ares is killed and mankind is supposedly free from his evil influence, we just went right back to a global war, but with even worse casualties this time.

After Diana kills Ares we could see her disillusioned that the soldiers didn't just become peaceful and are still attacking our three remaining heroes, who are essentially unarmed by now. Que one more heroic act where she helps them escape and they all go their separate ways with Diana saying she needs to get a better idea of the nature of man kind before she ever returns as a hero. She needs to figure out how to accept that this is a world both with Steve Trevors and Dr. Poisons.

Chris Pine seemed to play a bigger part in moving the story along than WW did. 


The CGI had a couple of good moments, but a lot of the human movement looked like people made of rubber being stretched in weirdly fluid motion. Also some of the fight scene cuts were straight from 80's B rate action movies. Zooming in on peoples faces during a fight and just seeing their arms flail in front of their head looks super cheesy. 


The trench fight scene? They have apparently been there for a year. Wonder Woman comes out to be a meat shield and Pine and crew take out what, 8 dudes? And all of a sudden the 100 allied soldiers are running out saying we've won! 

There was nothing special about the plot, and her ""Origin"" portion of the story was boring and repetitive. After having the Thor series already, the ""confused and doesn't understand our earth"" trope is kind of exhausted as well. Using WWI as a setting also after just doing WWII with Captain America felt the same way.

",6erigc
djgutjo,"I appreciate the effort you put into this post. A few things:

* Diana is the only child on Paradise Island. Sure it's not consistent across canon, but in this world, she is the only child. She clearly understands sex and other aspects of mankind through study - she mentions her understanding of sex with Steve on the boat. She doesn't need to see a child to understand that children exist. The amazons were formed from the gods, this was established in the mythos by Hippolyta.   

* Diana is stubborn, headstrong, and naive. These are character flaws that are central tenants of the character, and I thought were consistent from the start and on display in the scenes she burst in. She does not care for politics and has an optimistic world view that cannot be truly extinguished

* Diana is a god. Beyond her training, she is nearly invulnerable. While this scene looked like she was struggling, I saw it as a development of her powers. She spends most of it shielding, a symbol of hope for the troops. She can get dirty, fine, but she shouldn't be struggling with regular soldiers. She is Superman-levels of strong. The reason to root for Diana is not because she is always in trouble, but because her quest seems so hopeless. It's not about struggling against physical adversity. For a god, that isn't the problem. The problem is stopping all the pain and suffering in the world when you're that strong, and it's not possible. When you are as strong as Diana, it is not about who you save, but about who you cannot save. Superhero movies with overly powerful protagonists have often referenced this theme. Diana, like Superman, is supposed to be an inspiration for humanity, not walk among them as a really strong equal. 

* Diana has no reason to be smart, nor tactical. It isn't part of her character. Why would she be a master tactician? Even if she was trained on Themyscria, it would be in ancient amazon war tactics that wouldn't even make sense in WWI. Diana believes ending Ares will end the confusion of man. If she just stabbed him, everything would be solved. She comes to terms with her naivety after killing Ludendorff. Diana is impulsive and dressing up to stab Ares at a party perfectly shows that off.

* Regarding your last points, I think you missed a part of the dialogue. Diana *is* the child of Zeus and Hippolyta. The child of clay was a fake story her mother made, which was alluded to when she left the island. Ares and Diana also have a few lines of dialogue confirming she is a child of Zeus. So the whole ""Terminator"" theory is moot.

The Wonderwoman you end up proposing is always earnest, does her best, and her flaws are a result of her circumstance rather than her character. While it's not necessarily a bad direction, I feel your changes would ultimately compromise the whole point of the character and make a very generic Amazon Lady Superhero movie that is not WonderWoman.",6erigc
djhaaa6,"> 1\. Diana being the only child

That kinda makes sense, at least according to the comics. The rest of the citizens have been there for thousands of years. Diana is something ""new"".

> 2\. Military training is not for princesses

The theme of the beginning of the movie is that Hippolyta is an overly protective mother, who is reluctant to see her only daughter go out to do what she must do.

> 3\. Magical barrier two-way mirror / Whatever happened to the German boat?

Yeah, that bit is a little weak, though I must admit I never noticed during the movie itself so it presumably wasn't that important.

> 4\. When in Rome...

Her knowledge of the world outside of Themyscira is pretty minimal and there's no indication that she or anyone else knows, or has access to, anything about the current state of the world, or modern diplomacy, social customs, or anything else. She's also a precocious young woman. I'm not seeing any problem here.

> 5\. Crossing No Man's Land with style and grace

Yeah, true. Welcome to Hollywood. It's still an awesome scene.

> 6\. Shuffling priorities

This is her journey, she may exist for one purpose, but she's also (edit) a being with feelings and emotion, and constantly seeing new aspects of the world which change her priorities. That is, to a certain extent, what the film is about, if Diana just killed Ares and went home she'd be little more than a sociopath who did something positive that one time she left home.

> 7\. Evil bad guy is evil, obviously

Not going to disagree with the first part, but the second part: y'know, we do see Ares playing both sides. It's just the people on the British/American side we see him playing aren't comicbook villains.

> 8\. Look at me. I'm the Godslayer now.

HUGE SPOILER: [No, she wasn't sculpted out of clay. She's an actual God.](#spoiler) Again, she has an over-protective mother who's even lied to her to keep her safe. If she was [a clay terminator rather than an actual child](#spoiler) her mother wouldn't have been nearly as protective.

dir96a5,My takeaway from Ares explaining to her that she is the godkiller was because he was trying to seduce her to join him. He knew she was super-powerful and would benefit from enlisting her in his plan to rid the earth of hoomans. Makes sense he would do that in that context.,6erigc
diqwh9w,"You're on to something with delaying the ""godkiller"" line. I was expecting Diana's Mom to finally reveal it. 

Great film, btw.",6erigc
diqx5n3,"I think that applies to the exposition at the beginning too. Too much of Diana's backstory came out too fast and with too little context.

It's at least a little ironic that the story that compels Diana to do what she did in the film (seek out Ares, complete the Amazons' mission) was told to her by her mother to *keep her* from being interested in war. The backstory exposition here seemed like an afterthought.",6erigc
dih3mz2,You should be very proud!,6erigc
dk6bled,"I'm not here to criticize or defend Wonder Woman but to address your two specific issues with the film.

I believe it was Ares all along. Once he was defeated everything got quiet as if someone had flipped a switch. The fires died down. The earth stopped moving. How do you explain that?? Magic? Of course people started hugging each other because wouldn't you do the same if you'd just survived a forest fire/earthquake? All that lightning? The war did end, after all. 

My understanding is that (according to Ares) humans were imperfect but they needed a little nudge from the god of war to push them over the edge, so to speak. Something must have happened between the end of World War I and the start of World War II. Perhaps Ares was still alive? 

Yes, war is hell. I believe the word you're looking for is ""mockery."" Or disrespect? All I can say is that Wonder Woman is a comic book movie... Diana is the daughter of Zeus! This is an origin movie and No Man's Land is where Princess Diana became Wonder Woman in all her glory. Of course she's magnificent!! I paid good money to see that... three times! :)

No, Diana wasn't supposed to look or act like a real soldier or she'd still be stuck in No Man's Land! Her role was to lead and to inspire others, to ""fight for those who cannot fight for themselves."" Honestly, if I wanted to see a war movie I'd wait for Dunkirk. 

Let me give you an example. Twenty years ago the late Princess Diana (Prince William's mom) famously walked through a minefield in Angola. In many of the photos taken that day she was smiling and laughing, looking gorgeous and, some might say, magnificent. I bet she meant no disrespect to those maimed or killed... Her role was to raise awareness and inspire others to do the same: to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.

Having said all that, Gal Gadot (girl crush!) is the reason I saw the movie three times. I'm not a big Wonder Woman fan (Catwoman is way more interesting to me) but I think this is a good origin movie and the writers did justice to the warrior princess. They got everything out of the way - Diana's coming of age, the Amazons, Steve Trevor - because a sequel was never guaranteed. Now it's time for a little fun. 
",6erigc
dk4e70q,"I enjoyed it but I agree with your criticisms, the movie had SO MUCH potential for depth but then gave up in the second half.

Here are some the redeeming qualities I think it has;

1.) A heroic character - She's a beacon of hope and strength, starkly contrasted with Batman and even Superman in the DCEU. She feels more like Superman that Superman.

2.) Humor - I don't really care for humor but I had to admit, the jokes in this movie were very natural and not too...superhero cringy.

3.) Simple - Compared to BvS, this was a very simple movie in terms of plot. It wasn't heavy handed and geared towards a general audience. 

4.) Finally, this was a landmark achievement for a female director and a female character. Wonder Woman was respected by the camera, there wasn't a single cringy ass shot. Completely ignored the typical Male Gaze present in movies like this (though I would think Diana would wear more functional armor). ",6erigc
dmm61gw,"Yeah it wasn't that great like how people were hyping it.  But hey, at least it was still miles better than that atrocious BvS as far as DC movies go.  In my opinion, super hero movies are becoming more and more underwhelming.  The last good one I saw was Captain America 2.   Civil War, Ant Man, Deadpool, Avengers 2, BvS, Suicide Squad, Logan, GoG2... they all kind of was meh to me.  Don't get me wrong, I had fun with them since i'm a super hero junkie but great movies they are not.",6erigc

Zeus wasn't kicking, but his plan was. 

""He left us (the Amazonians) a weapon, one powerful enough to kill a God.... and all has been quiet since."" 

Looks like he left the Amazonians the ability to create Diana at the time of their choosing. The alternative is that Diana too  ~2000 - 3000 years to grow from birth to adulthood, which isn't likely.

 So we have to assume that the Queen did give life to Diana sometime in the ~1800s, perhaps Zeus left some kind of innate trigger when Ares returned, there was mentioning of knowing Ares was alive ""in their (the Amazonian's) bones"".

Why was the monster in BvS so difficult for a woman who killed Ares with the power of electric-love? Why is she jumping off the Louve?

I'll give it a go:

>What the hell are her powers?! Can she fly? Is she super strong? Is she a god?

Yes, she's a god, Ares explains that.  Don't know if she can fly, I had the same question.  Her picking up a tank was a good indicator that she's super strong.

>What the fuck was that sword good for? 

Ares also explains this.  The sword was nothing.  It was a way to misguide Diana, as she was actually the ""God killer"" given to the Amazons, not the sword.

>What do her gauntlets do?

Good question.  She has them with her since she's a child, I'm guessing one of the gifts from Zeus.  Still up in the air for a more specific answer.  They have some crazy protective/offensive abilities though, which we see in this film and in BvS.

>Is she bullet proof?

Don't think so, she got sliced early in the film when the Germans first attack Themyscira.  She healed very rapidly though, one of the Amazon's noted that it was ""odd"".

>Why was the monster in BvS so difficult for a woman who killed Ares with the power of electric-love?

Well, she's a God killer, so I'm assuming thats why its easier to kill Ares.  Doomsday was different, and was getting stronger with every attack and healed incredibly fast.  Which is why they had to go back to the ""kryptonite"" weakness, as he was basically unkillable.

>Why is she jumping off the Louve?

I don't know, I wish I could tell if she was jumping or flying.  I think she just heard some sort of commotion and was rushing out to help, similar to the way a few Spider-Man films ended with sirens and Spidey rushing out the window.",6erigc

I'm pretty sure we are supposed to believe Ares that humans are not inherently good after all, and that was a myth told by the Amazons.

Comic). 

He kept saying it's the first female lead superhero which I think is awesome but at the same time I don't think that automatically means super empowering. I totally agree with your point about feminism. Yes it's a female lead but I feel like a lot of the movie just emphasized her sex appeal - she's wearing this provocative skin tight outfit that looks like it's painted on and she is so gorgeous it's distracting.  I don't feel like we really felt that emotionally connected to her or really got to know her on a deeper level beyond the basic facts of her life.  To me that sends a message that reinforces the value of woman being based largely on her appearance versus other attributes.  She felt like a very one dimensional character. 

Edit: And also like her love for the male lead. Like what does she love so much about him? She's known him for like a few days and they got drunk together once.

dipblso,"Wonder Woman is a pretty dumbed down movie: Every twist and turn was telegraphed blatantly from miles away and the jokes were infantile and clownish, really the lowest form of written humour I've seen in quite a while.

The special effects looked terrible. I was taken aback with how plastic and CG the people models looked when flipping and fighting about, and the green screen effects look really badly composed, most of those green screen scenes felt shot in a tiny sound stage.

Gal Gadot can't act, she is just gorgeous and really looks the part, thus she gets away with it, but she looks like a runway model trying to pull off grimaces and emoting. And when she gets physical, it's either a CGI dummy or her looking real stiff and lanky. The characterization was heavy handed and obvious. Her squad was composed of the broadest cartoon stereotypes I remember seeing in a movie in a long while; I was hoping for Spud to start playing the bag pipe in the cafe scene.

I was bored to death the whole movie. I really got nothing from this movie. It might be the best DCEU movie, but that's a bar set really, really low. I wasn't a terrible movie. It was bland and dumb.

For contrast with this year comicbook movies, I didn't love Logan as much as everyone else did, but that was a compelling movie and you genuinely felt for Logan, and the other main characters. The special effects on Logan were on point, I was never distracted by fake looking shots, I was always engaged and even amazed. The fight sequences in Logan were intense and kinetic. Logan had a good story and was told really good. It had weight, impact, it had a tangible quality that made you feel every blow and emotion.

Guardians Of the Galaxy Vol. 2 had a clever, elegant script, amazing dialogue, out of this world set pieces, unique, well rounded characters with depth, and was gorgeous to look at on every frame exploding with color and masterful composition. The worldbuilding in it was so good that you never felt lost or deceived in the vast array of intergalactic locales and civilizations. It had smartly written jokes, that alongside all the other elements, contributed thematically and story wise to give the film momentum and weight to convey a message.

Wonder Woman had some good stuff, the Amazon Island in the beginning was interesting and had good characters. Also the animated Greek god sequences were fantastic. But after a promising start, it just became an obvious and badly written cartoon.",6erigc

One thing that kind of stuck out to me a few days after watching was that a lot of the plot just focuses on Diana's naivety, or her just being stupid in England and Steve having to show her the ropes of life and stuff.

Umm...no..hell no. Did you even watch the movie?  The fact is there is no single answer to why men kill other men. For religion, state, ideology, money, love, hate, race.  Killing some Taliban or ISIS head isn't just gonna end the conflict.  Killing Hitler would not have ended WW2. In fact, it was his military ineptitude that helped turn the tide in the Allies favor.  Had any assassination attempt (including German planned ones towards the end of the war) succeeded, for all we know the war could have still be raging now.  Operation Valkyrie despite what the survivors claim is not a bid to end the war and bring peace with the Allies but to replace what some Germans believe is a bad leader with a cult of personality and return Germany into more competent hands.  But hey, Allied tanks are rolling in Berlin, you better say you tried killing Hitler.

I do like the movie's depiction of what actual war is like, not stylized war propaganda where they paint over the ugly side of veterans. It's a good contrast to Captain America, his comic book origins as war propaganda and the CA:TFA's sanitized portrayal of Nazis thru HYDRA. Even his squad is portrayed as multicultural, happy go lucky and generally friendly.  Here the squad has some things they rather not talk about.  They get overly friendly with Diane but this too got subdued and overlooked to keep the story light.

Comparing it to Guardians of the Galaxy 2, Captain America Civil War, Avengers Age of Ultron and I just liked going back to a movie that had better character development. Where honestly the action scenes really weren't what made it shine.

When I watched those other movies I just had a complete and utter feeling of boredom unless the action was happening because there's not enough time to properly flesh out the characters. Add in the new Spider-Man movie looks like Tony Stark will be a focal character and I think it won't be able to measure up even close to Wonder Woman.

For a better origin to origin comparison, I liked Doctor Strange, but I think it just didn't have the same kind of slow transition with the character. Where Wonder Woman has her gradually changing and becoming a better hero toward the end, Doctor Strange while entertaining was him just suddenly becoming good at magic. Much more abrupt shifts.

Is Wonder Woman a 10/10? Probably not. Toss it into some of the earlier superhero movies and I wouldn't have such glowing recommendations. Compared to the current stuff? It's a cut above. For sure I'd give it an 8 or 9 with the ending CGI and battle being the weakest parts for me.",6erigc
dihpff9,This sums up my feelings as well. It was a decent movie but it certainly wasn't great. I certainly wouldn't expect it to have 93% that Rotten Tomatoes is giving it. I think Metacritic's score of ~76 is probably accurate though.,6erigc
dj8xe0c,"You're not alone, I agree with pretty much all of this. I can't say I *hated* the movie, because as you mentioned there were some genuinely good aspects of it, and it's the first DCEU movie I've seen that didn't just annoy the living hell out of me.

DC movies always seem to struggle with plot, and it seems like they have storyboards of a few cool shots or scenes and say ""okay, how can we build a story around these"" instead of crafting a really interesting story and saying ""how can we tell this with cool shots and scenes?""

Apart from what you've already mentioned I was frustrated by several other things:

Motives were fairly unclear throughout the movie, particulary with Danny Heston as Lundendorff. With the movie trying to portray WWI in a realistic and gritty fashion, they don't develop his role in the movie as anything more than the German baddy who barks orders at his subordinates.

Also, Hippolyta flip-flopping from ""Diana must never be trained, there's no threat"" to ""Antiope you must train her ten times harder than any other amazon"" didn't make sense. She mentions that the stronger Diana gets the closer Ares will come to finding her, but she trains for YEARS (centuries maybe, considering the amazons are semi-immortal) and apparently that wasn't a problem?

A shroud of invisibility that can easily be passed in and out of to enter and exit Themyscera doesn't seem like a great defense barrier and I'm surprised it hasn't been crossed by anyone else up until that moment in World War I.

Good thing the Germans and Turks speak perfect English the whole movie! I don't understand why they could get native speakers or language coaching and use subtitles, especially since they have Diana and Sameer speak a bunch of other languages with subtitles at other scenes in the movie.

ENDING SPOILER [Sir Patrick turning out to be Ares was incredibly underwhelming. Ludendorff couldn't have been more of a *red herring and Sir Patrick could only have been foreshadowed as the villain harder if he had turned away to stroke his mustache and snicker. Plus big bushy mustache make it hard to take him seriously as Ares](#spoiler)

Diana's level of naivety throughout the movie is inconsistent, and the other major inconsistency seemed to be the Amazons themselves. They're apparently a super strong super intelligent race of demigods, yet their understanding of the outside world seems to fluctuate dramatically. They have books that teach about reproductive biology, they can speak hundreds of languages, their combat training is incredibly rigorous, yet they seem to employ no military strategy when the Germans land on their shores. Aren't they of the era of ancient Greeks? Wouldn't they employ the phalanx or flanking or ANY strategy when getting shot at? Also, they speak German but haven't heard of the Germans before?

This movie has SO MUCH exposition and it's really heavy handed. From Hippolyta to Steve Trevor to Sameer to Sir Patrick, everyone has to explain everything in such agonizing detail that it's so clearly just for the audience and it takes you out of it every time. Especially considering they were emphasizing Diana as being sheltered and new to the world, why not let this information come to her when she needs to know or when it's too late, so the audience feels the same surprise and shock that she should have. Speaking of which, every revelation about the nature of the human world and her past and everything else seems to leave her mostly nonplussed.

Dr. Maru is introduced as a super interesting character and I was rooting for her as the main villain, but then she adopts the mannerisms of a weasel on caffeine pills and is just the igor-ish sidekick with no character development the whole movie. I found this incredibly disappointing.

So it makes sense, when Bruce asks Diana to help fight a coming war, she says that she that she walked away from mankind, from a century of horrors, man made a world where standing together isn't possible.

dih48qp,"She is not bulletproof in general, nor is she stab/slash proof. She is more durable than normal and the movie shows her to have accelerated healing.

The machine gun fire probably would have killed her if she didn't block it. She needs to use her shield and her gauntlets and her superhuman reflexes. 

Think of her skin as really tough, which is why she can't take a lot of blunt damage, but she is susceptible to piercing damage. Ares' swords would have cut her.

As for the gas, that is probably her demigod status making her immune to most things that would hurt a human. Gods and demigods are usually immune to poisons and toxins that would kill humans.",6erigc
dihfh18,"Exactly, I had the same issue. Is she a god or not? The scene in No Mans Land for example. The machine gun is raining down on her and she was shielding her mid section but her legs were exposed for a short bit. How did she not get hit by bullets? She later kneeled down but come on. Just say she is a god and cant be hurt by this puny weapons. ",6erigc
dih45wq,"As for her vulnerability to bullets, it could be due to the compressed nature of the impact along with the high impact velocity. If someone (Ares for example) could stab her with a sword with the same impact as a gunshot it's probable that swords could also harm her. With the getting punched through buildings though that distributes the force over a larger area of her body, similar with other forms of blunt force trauma.

I also didn't like the cheesy peaceful end where the humans stopped fighting after Ares died. Beyond that it was still a good fun movie. ",6erigc
dicl419,"Seriously. The whole Themyscara part felt very forced. Didn't like a lot of the acting for this part. The action was way over the top too. Why tf would you all jump down a cliff instead of shooting arrows? Then once you're down there just split off into a bunch of 1 on 1s doing flips and shit? They really half assed this set piece. If they made it a much larger force of Germans and didn't have the amazons doing all kinds of stupid flips and getting themselves killed it would have been much more interesting. Maybe give wonder woman's aunt a bit more screen time so her death feels more meaningful as well.

The pool scene as well as the boat scene were both very enjoyable. I really like how they built WW to not be naive in terms of sex. The part in London was actually pretty good. Chris Pine and Gal Gadot have good chemistry. 

I was not at all blown away by the no man's land scene. The crossing was just her running in a straight line followed by reflecting bullets with her shield before like 15 troops run across after her. Felt like they could have been much more creative with her movement. The scenes in the building with her were pretty good. The whole time I was just thinking how much better these scenes would be if they were choreographed by whoever does the choreography for captain america in the marvel movies. 

The scenes in the village afterword were a highlight of the film. WW's conversation with Steve and the silent shot of the town with snow falling were good emotional anchors. Her and Steve getting together felt earned and WW's lack of naivete about sex earlier in the film made it not feel like she was being taken advantage of.

The third act was a mess. Felt like the movie should have ended a couple times. The twist of Ares identity was pretty poorly done. If Ares had more screen time as a good guy it would have made the betrayal more effective. I actually like Ares arguments and Steve's sacrifice inspiring WW to win. ""Goodbye brother"" was also pretty sweet. What I didn't like was the whole return of the jedi trying to get WW to turn to the dark side bit. He literally says ""Do it."" This scene just dragged on so long and the armor looked terrible. I can't even count how many times WW got blown backwards. The speech about whether or not humans deserve to be saved was pretty good too until she started talking about believing in love. There's no depth to that.

She's there to protect humanity from itself and others. ",6erigc
dim3xb5,"I thought I was taking crazy pills. I really enjoyed the first half, but the No Man's Land scene just looked corny and dumb as fuck, and it was all downhill from there. 

I have a lot of feelings, and unfortunately you're about to get the brunt of it.

- The side characters were pointless or made no sense (marksman never shoots, and is.. singing again... for some reason.) As representatives of human goodness and finding acceptance across cultures they were fantastic. But as soldiers and part of battle they were totally useless.

- We also get this sense that Steve has some damage surrounding his role as a spy when she describes their team, but that doesn't culminate into anything. This was disappointing to me, because it set an expectation for some really interesting background that was never developed. I wanted to know more about all of these characters because I really liked them.

- First solid badass female superhero movie wins with the power of love. Goddammit. This is my only complaint with the feminist aspect. This movie handled that bit CRAZY well, and I was really pleased with it. I just wish her finding power in love was better paralleled in the beginning by her maybe being cold toward humans. They leaned into that later after the town was gassed and Steve died, but I wish it had been more prevalent throughout as a negative character trait. I think her thirst for war isn't as solid a parallel, considering she's from a warriorwoman culture.

- Gal Gadot was great with the fun dialogue. She really translated the character beautifully. But (you knew there was a ""but"" coming)  she isn't strong enough yet to carry scenes like the mustard gassed town. 

- I loved the first half, but three instances of ""Women can't do that!!"" followed by PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH then ""Wooooow"" is just overkill. It was forced, expected and overplayed the first time (alleyway), boring and repetitive the second time (bar), and it sucked the life out of what should have been the triumphant battle scene (No Man's Land and the town). 

- Holy shit the CGI was bad. I mean damn. Between the awkward acting and what felt like some seriously cheesy battle scenes, these were what kept pulling me out of the film. The constant barrage is what ultimately killed the movie for me.

- Ares was awful. It was a bad twist. Lupin is a great brit and a terrible greek god. The mustache was killing me and he just looked dopey with his CGI beefcake bod. Honestly I think Dr Maru would've been more compelling. She was a clear red herring, but I wanted it so much more. I love that she was so needy for praise and respect. It fit perfectly into the idea of Ares, the jealous and angry son of a greater god. Gods with daddy issues are intriguing to me. It also would've been more logical and compelling for Ares to *actually not exist.* What, war is dead, everyone hugs and the world never went to war again? In a comic book world where crazy villains are a staple?? I mean, you can't even pawn it off as ""well those are one off small events. There wasn't anything at that scale again."" WWII was a thing!


I really wanted to love this movie. I walked away very bummed. If anyone has any counter points I'm totally open to them. ",6erigc
dicr4ti,"Agreed man. The fight scenes had this weird editing to them where it felt like each cut jumped two seconds and the slow motion got tiring. 

The CGI was really really jarring too at times.. and the Ares fight felt alot like Wonder Woman vs Doomsday again. Idk? It was a good movie but everyone here seems to be treating it like gold simply because it's over 90% on RT.

I loved most of every other sequence that wasn't action (London, the town after the battle). So that's why I gave it a C+. I think once the hype dies off people will lower their scores a bit because it certainly doesn't deserve anything above a B, IMO. 

Edit: I should say after this movie I went back and watched the warehouse fight scene in BvS and that really compounded how the action went awry in this.

How bad are all the other DC movies? Were it not for having gone to the theater with my father to see this, I would have walked out before the film was half over.

I think an interesting plot line that is going to be missed is one where Ares uses WWI to setup for WWII and then they think that WWII is Ares big master plan.  In the second movie WW basically ends up trying to stop the atomic bombs from being dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki but is unsuccessful.  Maybe she's tied up earlier in the war because shes fighting and delaying the German nuclear program and doesn't realize that Ares is whispering to the Americans through the German scientists that defected.  She is ultimately unsuccessful in stopping the bombs from dropping and is then subsequently confused as it stops the war, so why would Ares want that?

Third movie, turns out that WWI was only to setup WWII which was only to setup the Cold War and Ares real master plan ends up being all-out Nuclear War and Wonder Woman has to stop the Cuban Missile Crisis.

I don't know, I'm not a writer so maybe that would all come across poorly in film or just isn't as good of an idea as I think it is, but I think it would've been more interesting than what we got.  It also wouldn't have had WW ready for a Justice League movie in time though.",6erigc

""He sees ghosts"", that's the one line we get, and then he just gets over with it when they succeed in killing all the bad guys. 
Sexism? they kind of just awkwardly put it out there, playing on our knowledge that sexism was a thing during that period, but they never bring it up for discussion. Diana asks how women are supposed to fight with the clothes presented, but we don't get an answer.

Make it an awkward but cute misunderstanding because Diana is so oblivious to the politics of the world of man.

Also, what was with Ares' plan? He whispers chemical weapons and war plans to General Ludendorff and Doctor Poison, yet he disguises himself as a diplomat trying to sign an armistice to end the war.

It's obvious that the final act is Synder's part of the story contribution, which almost everyone (critics and general audience alike) has noted is the weakest part of the movie. The final fight certainly bears Snyder's signature action and tone. 

Frankly the final villain and battle felt out-of-place and unnecessary.  There is a clear disconnect between the more colorful, fun first and second acts vs the very Snyder-esque third act.  The movie could have stuck to the the bold choice of attributing evil to mankind themselves instead of one supervillain, and have Wonder Woman grow to accept the duality of men.  The supervillain's appearance undermines Steve Trevor's earlier speech to Wonder Woman and his sacrifice. (IMO, the part after Wonder Woman killed whom she thought was the supervillain, and then got confused and puzzled and then upset that the war and fighting did not end right away, is the best part of the movie.

This is a good point. WB/DC, Universal, Transformers, etc are all being rather reactive and clamouring to battle against Marvel's blockbusters that are now at 3-per-year. Marvel broke the mould and have time on their side - unfortunately, with the other studios, they're caught between creating films that work stand-alone and also set up other sequels and multi-film plot arches. 

Two big things that I think have happened recently that are changing how studios approach their IPs. The first is Marvel's continued success through many different stories, films and directors. They are continuing to keep their relevancy after almost ten years. The second is the rejuvenation of the Star Wars saga - not only creating a billion-dollar sequel to a film from decades prior (see also *Jurassic World*), but also making incredible stand-alone films whose prequels and sequels are already set up.

Captain America is my favourite superhero but I thoroughly disagree. Cap 1 really sanitised the war and glossed over most of the actual fighting in a short montage. I remember being really frustrated that we barely get to see Cap fighting in the war. Plus, we barely get a glimpse of the Howling Commadoes, who got maybe two lines per character in the entire film (and that's being generous).

In my opinion, Wonder Woman did a much better job at showing the impact of war on the soldiers and civilians. I really got a sense of the gravity, violence and scope of the conflict - it was a major aspect of the movie whereas in Cap 1, it felt like more of a backdrop rather than a driving theme. Wonder Woman's team was also MUCH more fleshed out and served both a thematic and narrative purpose, with each member actually getting a character arc. Plus, despite an overuse of CGI and slow motion, I found Wonder Woman to have much more exciting and creative fight scenes than Cap 1.

I liked both movies but I'd give WW a strong 8/10 while I'd give Cap 1 a decent 6.5/10.",6erigc

I picked up somewhere in the middle of the fight with Ares that she's the God Killer, or rather that she's WAY more powerful than even she knew.  I think she's supposed to be a demigod, or some kind of power level that is basically on par with a Greek god; wouldn't be surprised if Zeus is her father.

Whatever it is, they loosely hinted at her hidden potential with the dialogue between the Amazons at the beginning of the movie BUT after that the movie leaves it.  They don't really give any straight answer so it's very confusing.  It makes you wonder how long she's actually lived for, how long she's trained and all this shit if she only just figured out she can reflect lightning beams out of her bracers.

Also the power of love is probably not that far off from the answer, because Amazons are all about using love to stop war.

Although, it felt like this movie wasn't sure whether to be serious or to be campy. I wish they would have gone full serious (like Nolan's Batman trilogy for example), or full in-your-face campy (like Kung Fury). It's just jarring to be jerked around with the overall tone.

The fighting scenes were so ridiculous to me that it totally took me out of the movie whenever there was any action. The heavy reliance on CGI didn't help either.

If you're going to make a movie with some heavy explanation, especially information that is very new to audiences (presuming you do not follow the comics), that's cool, but gimmie the information! I think this film would have benefitted from a little less now and then a later prequel or something that goes a little heavier into the explanation of the lore and new world ideas. This would work because you know damn well they're going to get as many films out of this as they can. So why not focus in on this awesome new superhero to break up this ho-hum of a superhero genre we've got ourselves stuck in? Especially an interesting and fun one (shout out to you, Gadot). And then dive into her background and explanation a little more once we've already been enticed by how rad she is?

I didn't feel like it was the lore concept itself that ruined it for me, but the introduction of a new world was a little overwhelming and not clear to me, as a non-comic follower.

1) The Lighting - I know that the director wanted to showcase the difference between Themyscira and the Real World and used lighting to do that.

As for the rest of the motley crew I think it's fine that she gets to know humans who are morally flawed but not outright bad guys. It'd feel weird for her to make a judgment on whether or not humanity should be wiped out if the only person she knows intimately is Steve.",6erigc

I'm very glad to see DC with a breakout character though, because Batman and Superman and several other failed attempts were looking pretty sad compared to the big, diverse, and likable marvel uni cast.  

That said, I think this is the kind of movie that had to be made to open up this genre to different avenues of storytelling.  There had to be the first female superhero movie, and it had to be at least sort of safe.  In that regard I think they hit the bulls eye.

I mean, I could just restate all of your points. You're right about everything. The symbolism of the woman coming of age in a man's world was cool. The defeat of that man, cool. Adding in nods to ethnic minorities fighting the same fight of discrimination...  still cool I guess. Casting Ares as the whitest old dude stereotype of all old dudes was stupid.

i interpreted it as Hyppolita being torn between what she knows she must do and keeping her daughter safe.

>The love plot and WW's naivete. I assume this movie is supposed to be empowering for women, yet the running joke throughout the movie is how naive she is about relationships, and of course, she falls in love with the first man she meets and his death/advice is how she realizes what to do. Oh, and she can’t get to the front without him, and constantly needs stuff explained to her. Its really dumb to be all about “woman power” when she basically requires a man to do anything useful or accomplish her mission. I know this makes me sound like I am some sort of super feminist, but I would actually like a female superhero and not arm candy that is also a super hero. 

i dunno, i thought the love story was rendered better than in most action movies, they actually have meaningful conversations and it's not just girl catches a glimpse of guy and instantly falls head over heels in love. As for the men being the only ones to do meaningfull stuff.. it really didn't seem like that to me, most of the movie is Steve telling Diana: ""no we can't do that"" and Diana going idgaf and doing that anyway. It actually felt more like Steve & co. were basically useless except for steve's final sacrifice.

So many awkward close-ups (did the little girl piss anyone else off?), forceful and decadent camera shots trying to spell out to the viewers 'THIS IS COOL', and dragging out Diana's naivete. Literally the only part where I wasn't laughing at the corniness was liberating the town, dancing at the cafe, and the no-dialogue hotel scene. Not the trench part, that was stupid (literally every time she blocked a bullet with her bracers it made it a big deal. Like we get it, she can deflect arms with arms, cool, show some real-time action). The building to building fighting was actually well-done, not a dumb flipping-from-horses, stupidly-slow-motioned, everything-is-the-most-epic-ever cgi-fest. 

She should have become more jaded around the middle of the movie, not last twenty minutes. Just so much going on in the climax it felt like nothing was. She was on her heels the entire movie, in Themysciera (sp?), in London, in war. The only part where it felt like she wasn't a ditz was murdering people, and the final 20 minutes.

Great acting, great or poor art design, no in-between, dumb fight scenes with like two awesome ones, and too many close-ups, not enough zoomed-out shots for action scenes or really anything.

Finally, while Gadot is a really good choice, and all the acting was stellar, I do wish she was more muscular. It just didn't feel realistic to me that this slim person could not be so fragile, but that is a personal opinion, and I realize everyone I have talked to does not feel as I do.",6erigc

I would avoid it for young children for one scene in particular. WW is   waiting to board a ship and watches the disembarkation of wounded soldiers. This is her character's introduction to the ravages of warfare. The camera lingers on soldiers in agony, some with ragged bandages covering their face, and a man on crutches missing part of a leg. It's an important scene for her character development and even though there is no overt gore, the somber tone could be too much for some children.

Also, the movie is almost 2-1/2 hours long. There are lots of talky scenes that are worthwhile in an adult context but completely meaningless to very young children.

(Background: I have three children. I have watched a lot of movies with them and I like to stretch their minds.

A lot of early chemical weapons were cannisters of chlorine gas buried in the ground in advance, so they'd sit there for a while then when the wind was right, someone would unseal the top of the cannister and the gas would then blow out over the enemy trench.

Also remember the gas was flammable so the bombs weren't intended to detonate on impact, they were meant to impact then disperse (or disperse in the air, I don't remember) and the bomber wasn't really set up to go back and set the timer once they were in the air...

However, unless there's a gap in my aircraft history knowledge (I did ten years as an air force cadet :P) I don't remember there being anything resembling that bomber in WW1, and they sure as heck wouldn't have had the altitude-triggered fuses from WW2 bombs, so it was probably just the best alternative the writer could come up with.

dieadru,"I think you make a lot of great points, but two issues you raised I was okay with, and I'll explain my reasoning as to why.

I came prepared with my eye-roll in case Wonder Woman was going to have an obligatory romance arc in the film, (which, even if said love interested survived the film.... Justice League takes place almost 100 years later, so...)

But in a lot of ways I felt like the romance was done much more tastefully than other superhero films have done it, and if I can argue for it, portrayed in a way that we don't typically see in a big budget major studio action release. 

Let's get this out of the way first: it's an action film. Romances tend to suffer because they're shoehorned in, there's generally a lack of on screen relationship development, as well as individual character development because of the screen time that gets devoted to action scenes and other exposition. Characters ""fall in love"" and will declare so even though audiences will generally feel that they've barely gotten to know each other by the end of the film. Wonder Woman is probably guilty of all of these. 

Despite this, I love Wonder Woman's initial characterization, her curiosity toward the world, and her general child-like demeanor and innocence. Despite the jokes made throughout her interactions with Chris Pine's character, I really don't feel like Wonder Woman was portrayed very sexually at all. Despite their respective actors both being in their 30's, with the way that Diana's growth is portrayed (she is finishing her training the day she meets Chris Pine's character) and with the knowledge of how old the average soldier was during WWI, I wouldn't be surprised if a more age appropriate casting of the two leads might have actually intended for them to portray 17-23 year old's instead.

My point in bringing up this observation is to say that Wonder Woman's journey and growth throughout the film seem to be more a journey based on discovery, and her gradual becoming of a woman, rather than centering around a romantic arc that forms her backstory and character. Love and loss, yes, obviously was clumsily explained in the film as the reason for her triumph over Ares at the end of the film, but in a lot of ways is key to understanding her relationship with mankind, and why she appears in the DCEU at all. Wonder Woman's relationship with Chris Pine's character, after all, is meant to embody her relationship with all mankind, her many disappointments in their weakness and deception, and yet, discovering the redeeming and selfless qualities within them. There's a lot of tenderness and sweetness in Gadot and Pine's interactions on screen that I genuinely felt was done in a way that captured well Wonder Woman's burgeoning relationship with mankind. Pine's character didn't come off alpha male bullshit strong, but it didn't feel corny to me either. I'm not a fan of the three little words at the end, but I'll give it to 'em.

I'll admit that I don't know too much about Wonder Woman mythos and won't claim to be a huge fan of hers, nor Superman. In my book, they're two unremarkable superheroes from alien places, whose only superpower is their physical strength, and who have no manner of solving problems other than punching them into submission. It's a key part of why Ares is one of her major nemeses throughout the comic book, because he feeds and grows more powerful off of conflict and combat, the only method of conflict resolution Wonder Woman has ever known. I'll just say that confronting her with an enemy that she can't directly overpower by punching is hard to do well, but really necessary to capturing the struggle and the nature of Wonder Woman.

As to the scene of the American and German soliders hugging at the end of the film, it actually made way more sense to me than Germans trying to create chemical weapons in the middle of signing an armistice. I really wish they didn't backtrack to making Germans the stereotypical bad guys, but if we know any of the history of the first World War, I do believe soldiers of opposing sides hugging at the ceasing of hostilities fit into the general perception of nature of the war. To add to that, I don't think the film explained very well that Ares, in accordance to what he is known for doing in the graphic novels, was in fact manipulating the two sides into fighting against each other, because he thrives off of conflict. Not sure why they decided to give him a weird monologue saying that he wanted peace by destroying mankind, which is a lie.

Anyway, I do realize you can agree with those points while still feeling that the film was written, shot, or directed poorly. I agree with you on all those parts and to all the other flaws you pointed out. I just also wanted to chime in with a few parts that I thought were done well, and are significant to bucking certain trends that superhero films have set. But on a whole, I do think the film is pretty average, with just a few redeeming qualities.

die7fgb,"Too lazy to counter more than a few of your points but here's the ones that stuck out to me:

>Misdirection was horribly done

I actually also really liked the amazons vs Germans scene, the part where Diana is standing around like an idiot and almost gets shot felt like a contrived way to insert drama but actually made a lot of sense once I thought about how literally every single Amazon except Diana is a battle-hardened warrior.

Now on to the cons.

> The writing is so very exposition heavy in ways where it could've been avoided

Holy shit yes. The first 30 minutes of the movie are just the exposition. The best (or worst) example is at the when Hippolyta tells Diana how she sculpted her out of clay and Diana goes like ""Mom, you've told me this story before!"", it's like the writers knew they were writing a shitty scene but still did it. The worst part is they repeat that clay thing in the boat scene and it actually makes sense there. The following story about Ares and the gods was kind of cool because of the visuals but I wish they had spread it out over the movie a bit more (which would've helped Ares character). There's also the whole ""secret"" that gets mentioned at least 5 times by the Amazons and then basically doesn't come back until the ""What are you?!"" line from the general (which was a great moment imo, another angle I wish they had developed throughout the movie).

> And the lasso and that entire fight in the third act looked really terrible at times.

What the fuck was that scene with Diana knocking out the soldiers?!? Not only was it horribly shot and edited, it also made no sense. She's supposedly mad at humans or whatever but then she's just like ""jk humans are cool, let's not kill the one person who actually deserves it"". That whole third act kind of felt like the movies budget ran out and they phoned it in for the most part.

> I had a feeling it was going to be Thewlis because he had only had five minutes of screen time up until that point and there was no way they would waste him, but I really just rolled my eyes when he revealed himself. You can do better than that, DC, I know you can.

Probably my biggest gripe with the movie not only because I felt Ares was handled badly but also because of the implications it ended up having for the movie's theme (human nature, good vs evil, etc). IMO the way the should've done it was to introduce Ares as a new character (while building him up a bit better before hand) and go all out with the whole influencing people thing. Gives us some nuance by showing Ares influencing both the German AND the British, which in turn gives Diana's arc some actual sense by having her think at first that humans are shitty but then realizing there are shades of grey when Steve [blows up](#spoiler).

One more thing I would like to add is how stupid and unnecessary those capsules that the General was sniffing were. They should've just had him die (even more) unceremoniously to further illustrate the futility of Diana's actions. 

Well, that was a bit of a rant. My conclusion is that it was an enjoyable flick (I hope this is Patty Jenkins' ""Batman Begins"" and that she gets to do a ""The Dark Knight"") and I do recommend it but I still haven't decided if I actually liked the movie or if I only think I like it after the horrible disappointing mess that were BvS and Suicide Squad.",6erigc

I didn't like that they were suddenly all friends at the end just because Ares died because it's clear from BvS that our species has an inclination for war.

When the movie ended, my buddy leaned over and asked, ""Did you like that Dragonball Z fight where she destroyed him with a kamehameha?"" Plus the level of CHI was too much for me. Multiple close ups of Gal Gadot with 100% CGI background then close ups of Ares with a fucking british mustache with 100% CGI background. Plus the Ares thing undercut any message about people being bad on their own.

Most amusing anecdote in the movie is that Steve actually kept the promise she was complaining he broke: He inadvertently brought her directly to Aries in his first act getting off the island.

dimq1jl,"> WW rushed to the frontlines to fight bad guys and stop Ares. Instead she stops to save a small village because she felt bad for every person she saw. I wanted some kind of consequence to happen but nothing came of that. 
> 

This was a hugely important moment for WW. She shows her generosity and compassion: two of her most valuable traits when it comes to how she'll work with the Justice League. 

It mirrors Superman's same struggles with the idea that in spite of their super powers, they can't be everywhere at once, they can't save every life. However, comparing her origin story to Superman's in *Man of Steel*, it is clear that Diana has the confidence in being a hero that Clark lacks initially, but regains at the end of BvS. She was born and bred for it...Clark was just a kid from Kansas. 

I give the subtext of Clark's story because I felt WW actually allowed me to enjoy both Man of Steel and BvS (not Suicide Squad regrettably lol) more because of this specific scene and other scenes like it. I watched them back to back upon returning home because I don't know how to hold myself over until JL.

This idea of a hero's sacrifice (is it worth it or not?) is a huge theme throughout all three films. It starts with Jor-El in the very opening moments of Man of Steel. TBH, I love all three films. I'm very glad WW was critically well-received but I believe all three to be some of my favorite all-time movies.

Not to digress too much from the point; however, with the DCEU somewhat firmly established, we have to be looking at these films in a collective way as well appreciating them for how they stand up on their own. WW was an all-around classic as a standalone feature but I really commend DC on sticking to their guns in a way and building on the past films instead of completely abandoning them due to critical response. New themes were introduced, old themes were built upon, perfectly paving the way for JL. All around win for DC.

dignlu1,"Rather than downvote you like some people, I hope I can at least make you understand why the movie might connect with some people even if it didn't connect with you.

I also found the film very predictable and it used a lot of familiar tropes but I also really enjoyed it. For me, predictable or familiar isn't necessarily a bad thing as long as you enjoy the journey. Some of my favourite movies of all time are painfully predictable and borrow a lot from other films but it doesn't matter because you enjoy the characters and the setting enough that you actually WANT to go where the film is leading you.

That's why Wonder Woman is a film that lives and dies on whether you emotionally connect with Wonder Woman, Steve Trevor and the supporting cast. If you don't, then everything falls flat because you can see everything coming a mile away. If you do, then it's great because you're happy to go on a journey with these characters even if you know the destination and all the pit stops.

I can't speak for everyone who liked the movie (and I haven't actually read many reviews so I'm unsure if this is the consensus) but I was drawn in by the chemistry between Diana and Steve Trevor and ended up being really invested in their growing relationship which had this old school screwball comedy charm to it.

I also really enjoyed the performance of Gal Gadot in particular as she pulled off the innocence and adventurous nature of the character really well. I appreciated that they didn't make her a generic man-hating warrior woman but instead a likeable, relatable and well meaning but flawed character.

2.)This is the huge issue with the DCU in my opinion, (although marvel isn't much better) all of the heroes pardon 2-3 are just way too powerful.

Flash can go so fast as to outrun death, superman is so strong and fast and he travel through time, and in some comics he can like rip worlds in half and shit, wonder woman is litterly a god, which you can totally take her power to 9000 and just poof people gone, oh and aquaman controls ALL fish. Plus he regularly fights cthulu.

I feel one of dc's biggest struggles is you can't make tragic movies about heroes who are that big, I mean ffs, who honestly though BvS would be the end of superman? Who honestly thought WW would lose ww1? The flash movies will be a question of ""gee, flash goes fast and this movie is quickly going nowhere!"".

As the conversation was happening I was thinking ""Ooh! is she going to banish her?"" but then it sounded more like she was saying ""There's a good chance you'll die and I'll never see you again.""

(re: BvS & Sword, I think it's a different sword. I saw someone comparing screenshots and they don't look very similar) ",6erigc

1) I didn't see it as banishment from the island. The way it was spoken was more of a you may not survive or you may not want to come back vs you're not allowed back. 

2) I don't think she was banished. 

3) It seems that the mother was content with being hidden away. If trouble didn't come to them, they weren't going to go looking for it. I don't think the mother told her about her power because Diana would then want to use that power. Using / building up that power could attract the (unwanted) attention of Ares. The god of truth stated that he was able to sense what Diana was when he met her. So it seems that she gives off some vibe as she grows in power. Which is most likely why she didn't want her to train. 

4) They fought off Ares with the help of Zeus (which was supposedly the best of the gods). With this help they still didn't manage to kill Ares (as far as they know). Knowing that you barely etched out a victory with best god at your side and now having him gone your not going to be looking forward to another round with Ares again. 

5) There were more than just a Christian presence in the world. Hindus for example believed in multiple gods. To end up on an island in the middle of nowhere it would not be unusual to find the inhabitants not only did not believe in Western religions but would believe in something that has long since fallen out of favor. There's also the matter of his situation. If there was an airport or train back to London he could have said ""you gals are nuts, I'm outta here"". But he had to take what he could get. 
Also there's the fact that he did watch a group of women take down a well armed German army (navy) with bows and arrows. If someone was telling this as a story it would be very hard to swallow. But he's experiencing it for himself. ",6erigc

diemip4,"> How did Wonder Woman gain access to books on reproduction, and how was she not aware of the concept of marriage, were they not included in the books and did the Gods not marry?

Ancient Greek or even Roman marriage only vaguely resembled what modern westerners think of as marriage. Some of the Greek gods were ""married"" but slept around all the time. And it sounded like the books were written by amazons anyway.

>Why did no one lose their shit at the sight of Wonder Woman single handedly destroying German platoons and machine gun nests? Everyone seemed to note it casually as if it happened all the time, and was not in fact something that defied norms. 

This one I think is just a product of the time this film came out. If they'd intercut a hundred shots of soldiers doing hilarious double takes, people would whine about how it's just feminist propaganda. And the point of the scene was her outstanding bravery that inspired the soldiers, not how weird she was. And anyway, in ww1 those poor soldiers were seeing insane shit all the time, usually right before it killed them. I think they were just excited to be gaining ground.

> Lastly, what the hell did Wonder Woman do during the interval of World War 1 to the present day? Had she just gone into hiding even though she had said she was committed to protecting mankind and combating war?

We'll find out in Wonder Woman 2, I'm sure.",6erigc
diehhf4,"-You don't know if there was a single night of sleeping or 10, you just know Diana was sleeping when they arrived in London.  

-Fair point, it was odd

-Reproduction and marriage don't always go hand in hand and marriage is somewhat of a new social construct 

-If you were stuck in WW1 trenches and someone started clearing them, you would probably pay little attention to the ""how is she doing that?"" and more attention to taking advantage of the situation, although I think the reaction part of that scene definitely could have been handled better, I don't think it was a ""flaw"".

-There is always a chain of command.  If a general is killed, someone will take his place (Colonel, etc).  If 10 are killed, 10 take their place.  The Colonels and such probably had similar views and opinions to the high command we saw.  

-By no means all of the German leaders were killed.  It was a room with ~10 military minds.  A definite blow to the leadership but by no means all encompassing.   Always people to take their place.  Hitler was a private in the first world war, he could still rise to power all the same.  The older German generals from WW1 had very little to do with WW2 in the grand scheme of things.

Ah, yep! Just what I was going to say. Especially after this being touted as a film empowering women, it falls into the most overdone and unecessary trope that there is. Female main character? Welp, she must fall in love with the male main character then.

>What about all the cheesy old school directing with her walking down the middle with stuff going on in the background and wind in her hair trying to sound badass with some lame spiel?

I thought some parts of the spiel were good, some were really bad. Like decentish in concept itself, but none of it sounded like... professional production. Ya know? And so many poorly done scenes to just give us info or tell us what a character feels/what their orientation is. Forced info, rather than natural storytelling.

>This movie is trash

Same, how is it over 90? I could legit see 80. But not 90.

Final thought..... I can't fucking believe that she hopped over a trench into no man's land, and suddenly the entire army followed, and the Germans just kept shooting her only, and none decided to shoot for her feet, or just ten people at once in such succession that she can't block them all fast enough.

The Joker was something so new at the time and the role was played so masterfully by Heath Ledger, that a lot of DC films since have tried to copy its success and have failed because they're trying to imitate something that can't be imitated. They think they can do like Marvel and just follow a formula set forth by their most successful hit and it will be A-okay. What made The Dark Knight so innovative at the time was that it was both a superhero movie and very realistic, and The Joker was refreshing because he was a villain that didn't have some convoluted backstory and desire for vengeance (that we knew of), he didn't have some biological tie to the hero, he didn't have any real reason for doing what he wanted to do other than in Alfred's words, to see the world burn. In 2008 that was a pretty new concept in the realm of hero movies. By 2017 however they've fucking played that card so many damn times it just gets laughable to observe in a movie and to hear.

Some of my gripes are gripes with superhero movies in general: the plot was extremely predictable & it was obvious Lupin was Ares from the very first scene they showed him. Also the rest of their little party was completely pointless. They were basically there for a bit of comedic effect. The ending with the German soldiers all happy and getting along with everyone just because Ares died didn't make any sense. And aside from No Man's Land I don't think they did a very good job of depicting the horror of WW1.

dihdskh,">1) WW1 through Hollywood eyes. WW1 was shitty. Both sides (Central and Allies) were shitty. We all did things we're not proud of. 

The film has plenty of moments where it suggests that everyone on both sides has their flaws and is in it for the wrong reasons. And of course at the end when the germans realise the war is over they embrace the men they were just fighting.


> This point leads directly on to my second gripe
>2)  It was funny for about 15 minutes, then it gets old.

It doesn't really last much longer than 15 minutes though.

>3) Subtitles. Why do all the Germans speak English with a German accent? Are they speaking German (a la 'Allo 'Allo)? Do the film makers think that the audience could not focus on too many subtitles? Clearly the film has no problem with subtitles as the scene between Diana and Sameer. 

There's a difference there though. The Diana and Sameer scene needed subtitles because the whole point was that non of the others can understand them. As for the rest of the German scenes all I can say is this is a 100 million dollar plus movie aimed at a general audience. Excessive subtitles really isn't a viable option. 


>4) The big bad reveal. This is a prime example of a badly written twist. Randomly picking out a minor character and making him the bad guy all along is extremely lazy writing. A well written twist has you look back over the film and see all of the subtle hints or clues that you missed, or when you watch the film again with someone else, has you hiding sly looks to see if they have picked up on the hidden secret. Ares' reveal was so meh. 

There's plenty of clues that Sir Patrick was Ares during the film. I think the biggest mistake they made was having him with that mustache during the flashback. If he'd had a full beard then his mustache under the helmet wouldn't have looked so silly. (small details but they really matter). 

I just think if Houstan's character was going to be a red herring then that twist was always going to feel a bit hollow. But then again I like the idea that Houstan's character was just a man pushing to keep the war going rather than Ares doing it in such a direct way. 

>A better ending (IMO) would have been for Diana to have been wrong all along, and have her faith in mankind restored by Steve's sacrifice.

That's pretty much what happens though. She thought Ares was the root cause of the war but she was wrong. He was just fanning the flames but he didn't start the fire. She was distressed about this realisation that men are inherently evil even without Ares's influence. Steve's sacrifice and her weirdly remembering what he'd said to her when she didn't hear him earlier restored her faith or at least revealed to her the truth. That there is light and dark in all people. But if you show them love the way she did steve and the other characters then you'll bring out their best.

On a broader note Ludendorff's death served the purpose of stealing away Diana's naivete.

i saw a user review, that praised DR.POISON, not because of her being a good villain, but because she was a strong female character, she wasnt a slave working against her wishes or anything like that, she was an intelligent woman working for someone who considers her an equal, the other generals werent shunning her work because she was a woman, but because it would disrupt the armistice talks,  when Steve Trevor tries to hit on her to get info, she doesnt really buys that shit because she doesnt need to be flattered, when she is face to face with Diana, she doesnt begs for mercy, she was scared because who wouldnt, but she stood there.

One huge theme of the film is that humans aren't paragons of good nor evil, but rather a mix of those traits, and what a person *does* is a better read on them than some mythical sense of who they *are*. So we saw both of the German baddies committing atrocities, but it was *banal evil* - like, Adolf Eichmann wouldn't make a terribly compelling badguy in a comic book movie.

I will admit that Ares could have been better balanced with Dr Poison. The stakes could have felt higher for the finale fight if they had some more character development scenes. Given that its a 2hr+ movie, I can understand how some of those scenes might have been left on the cutting room floor. 

It felt like they had also intended to flesh out her team more too. The sniper had a bit of that, but it was never fully realized.

I personally feel that this movie was better than Guardians 2. It didnt overly linger on dumb jokes that dont all land well. I dont think people enjoyed it simply because of 'girl power'. I actually felt like it was a good movie. At the end of it, we got to follow her through an intricate character evolution.

Edit: A personal opinion for sure; but the whole daughter of Zeus and being confirmed as literally a goddess and god-killer I think explains ANY power she shows.

**Sex & Nudity:** 

* A very brief suggestive scene involving passionate kissing
* Moderate sexual innuendos 
* Women wear occasional revealing clothing
* A brief scene involving a bare chested and near naked male 


**Violence & Gore:** 

-Mass destruction and people being hurt and/or presumably killed by explosions -A brief scene involving a man being subject to a deadly gas -In a variety of battle scenes, people are hit, sometimes lethally with weapons including spears, knives, swords, and bullets -A man is stabbed with a sword -Electricity is sometimes used to shock people -People falling from heights or being crushed is implied -Occasional war imagery -A man sacrifices himself by flying a plane of lethal explosives into the air and detonating it -Some people are threatened with guns and punched -Bodies are seen lying out in a number of scenes, though indistinct -A man has a traumatic dream -A room of men is subject to a lethal gas - we don't see anything of it 


**Profanity:** 

A few uses of ""hell"", once with the British profanity ""bloody"". 


**Alcohol/Drugs/Smoking:** 

We see a man with a cigarette in hand A scene takes place in a bar, where people are scene drinking A man is drunk in one scene We see a man repeatedly inhale substances from a capsule that appear to have a drug-like enhancement effect 


**Frightening/Intense Scenes:** 

Fight scenes are typically very loud, prolonged, and often intense, particularly near the end, but are extremely bloodless - in fact, there's almost never any sign of it whatsoever. Mass murder, while discussed, is typically never shown, and any mature thematics are typically confined to generalized themes of fascism, war, and human evils. There's no particularly frightening imagery, though a woman has a slight face deformity - nothing horrible. There are a number of emotional exchanges between Diana and Steve.",6erigc

They're just dudes and on top of the horrors of trench warfare now they've got to deal with getting their backs broken by Wonder Woman?""  That's not fair.

dilpo5o,What movie is that?,6erigc
dilreoh,"That scene seemed pointlessly over the top to me, and I think the movie would be better without it. But after chewing things over a bit, I see why they did it. That scene, and others that showed Ludendorff as a manic psycho, were there to make us feel better about Diana executing him later in the movie. The part where she stabs him with her sword then looks around and realizes that nothing has changed is one of the most important scenes in the movie, both for her character arc and as a reveal of the real villain, Ares. But they needed to get there without turning off the audience by making Wonder Woman look like a Punisher-style murderer. So the idea is to make Ludendorff so over the top evil that we accept his execution and move on quickly to the next thing.

But this undermines one of the main messages of the movie, which is that people are capable of both extreme evil and self sacrificing good without the influence of external forces pushing us on, and that war isn't a simple story where the good guys beat the bad guys and then live happily ever after. If they had made Ludendorff more three-dimensional while still leaving in the scene where he gasses an innocent village, it would have fit better with that theme, even if it risked alienating the audience.",6erigc

The band of friends that Steve put together seemed totally just randomly thrown in the movie too. Like what was the point of them besides some minor comic relief?

Her wide-eyed bewilderment was kind of endearing at first, but not when it drags on for the entire 2nd and 3rd act.

Another way to say this is the dialogue is shit. Haha.

You make some good points, for sure, but you seem to ignore a lot of this movie's glaring flaws like the cheesiness (starting and ending with jarring, nearly incomprehensible voiceovers, followed by an impossibly goofy and unnecessary series of scenes of child Diana), the cliches, stereotypes, and absurd bit parts (the poorly acted, nearly undeveloped Native American tracker, for instance), terrible villains, and incredible underuse of Chris Pine.

Chris Pine, like you say, is absolutely great, but he barely had a chance to shine with this movie's horrible dialogue. He seriously had at least four separate moments where his character just mumbles and stutters in the weirdest way.

Also, the romance between Steve and Diana was *not* earned, and even though a lot of people in this comment section are loving it, the self-insistently emotional scoring during Diana's charge into No Man's Land made me cringe a little, even if the action itself was awesome.

After you see enough movies you'll start to realize where lazy filmmakers use heuristics for ""feel this emotion here"" rather than actual earning those emotions from their audience.

During an Armistice, bombing London(where the generals of Britain thought that the original target were the soldiers), would make the entire world go through an endless war where they annihilate each other.

Wonder Woman realized in the end that mankind had evil in their hearts, and also the capacity of love(Steve's sacrifice even in the face of despair/hate of the world, because he believed in what his father said), and that mankind has to find out themselves. She decided that fighting wars isn't the answer and that helping the helpless was. 

 >They kept building up the idea that just killing Ares wouldn't fix humanity. But then she kills Ares and everything is fine.

Ares did have influence over them. Giving them ideas, weapons etc, so that War was highly influenced by him because he wanted the endless war, which can only happen if the Germans drop the poison bomb in London. Once Ares died and the poison destroyed, there were no influence over the Germans, and they were free.

But, of course, man being man, and Ares being correct in mankinds corruption(which Wonder Woman said that he was true), eventually, man kept on waging wars for pointless reason.

>If anything, the opposite should have happened. She should have seen that humanity is good deep down and decided to protect that.

It undeniably had feminist undertones throughout it and I think you are correct in not understanding feminism. Having more male characters than female characters and not many female producers doesn't negate the feminist messages throughout it(it is a bit absurd that you would think that).

That was an amazing moment, when that realization dawned on her that people were to blame and not something supernatural, I loved that, it felt different and perfect and was the only time in the movie I felt they got something perfect.

Then Ares arrives and they fight for WAY to long, and finally he goes down and then the same message is revealed, it felt terrible, I hated it.

I feel it would have been far better without that final fight scene.

didi9xa,"Cause killing Ares didn't stop the War? Steve Trevor sacrificing himself and blowing up the killer gas stopped the war (from continuing). 

Diana in the opening and ending sequences (voice over in the 'present') is very clear about what she was wrong about regarding humans. In her 'revelation' with Ares, he proves to her that humans can do evil on their own ""I don't make them use the weapons"" among other things (Ludendorff's use of the gas on the village, the London general saying soldiers die cause that's their job) She CHOOSES to fight for human existence anyways, because she believes that if humans find LOVE for one another, they will not do evil. 

At the beginning of the movie she talks about how she once wanted to save the World, kind of inferring 'Back before I knew better...' - in the end she follows up that with something like (sorry don't have the script in front of me) '...now I know that each person has the potential for darkness inside them and must choose for themselves.' 

So if you take the entire context of the movie, the beginning 'save the world' thing means that she believed beating Ares would force humans to doing good (since she believed humans were always good without Ares influence). Then through the events of the movie, she learned that she was wrong about humans being naturally good and that it was a choice for them to be good (like Steve Trevor) or evil (like General Ludendorff).

dicr9vh,"I'm on mobile so excuse the formatting. I'll try answering some of your questions as best I can. 

1) I might be wrong but I think her mom said she ""may"" never return. Her mom was probably scared Ares would kill her. 

2) I thought they hid it from her so that she wouldn't leave the island. If she knew she was a Goddess she may have been inclined to leave. 

3) As far as I know they aren't human. They touched upon the Wonder Woman mythology. They were created by the God's themselves. I believe they never left that island because they feared Ares would find them. Without Zeus or a fully grown Wonder Woman they wouldn't stand a chance. As far as aging and the perception of time goes.. I'm not sure. Steve's watch stops working while in Themyscira. So perhaps time moves at a much slower rate. 

4) Training would be my best guess. You also have to remember that the Justice League trailer hinted at a war that involved Themyscira. It wouldn't surprise me if some of the Amazons seen in Wonder Woman took part in that battle 

5) Yep to distract anyone from finding the God killer. This also served as a good distraction for Diana. Her attention was on the sword and not her true origin. 

6) Can't really answer this. Gotta think about it. 

7) I think she references Ares when she says this. Now whether is Ares can be considered part of the normal world or not is subjective. My guess is she doesn't view Ares as part of it. Also she could also be referencing other people she's fought over the years. Remember theres a huge time gap between WW and BvS so she could've fought other villains. 

8) I think this might be a consistency issue. But I also think she went away after Steve's death. Ares may have convinced her that no matter what she does there is nothing she can do to stop people from fighting each other. I imagine Steve dying only emphasized this. Plus while watching the I couldn't help but think of Bruce's speech at the end of BvS. ",6erigc
dicrd3w,"the movie glossed over a lot of things. For example, the amazons have been around for a LONG time. Their revolt happened when ""time was new"" according to the movie. 

I am under the impression from the movie that the amazons in the movie do not age since Diana's mother is the one who rebelled against men. Diana is also the only child and she was made from clay so I am guessing all of the amazons are women getting sealed off originally.

I am not nerdy enough to know how the island works exactly; I think the animated movies and comics go into it a lot more.

> Why exactly can't Diana return to the island?

The movie has no clear explanation but I think the animated movie has. At some point, Diana has to cut tie with the island in order to protect the amazons (just recalling from memory)

The whole dying Zeus thingy is purely movie plot. It honestly doesn't make a lot of sense since [Ares doesn't look so tough; WW owned him with the bracers. I honestly think DCEU should have kept Zeus around like what Marvel did with Odin. Making Ares a one-shot villain is a waste](#spoiler)

> In Batman Vs Superman, Diana says ""I've fought monsters from other worlds before
> Also in BvS, Diana's character has pretty much given up on humanity

dicrf1y,"> *Why was the sword in the protected area of the island where they housed the ""gifts of the gods""? The rope of truth is obviously useful and not made in this world, the shield seems practically invincible, the armbands as well... but the sword seemed exceptionally unexceptional really. Was its purpose just a trick to distract anyone that happened to find the island looking for it from the true ""God Killer""?

The sword ultimately doesn't matter.  Whether it was just intended to be a decoy or if it had some other mystical meaning, we don't know.  I think it seems somewhat unexceptional primarily because Ares was able to destroy it just by touching it basically, otherwise it served its purpose throughout the rest of the story just fine.  Since Diana has a different sword in BvS, it's likely that it just didn't really matter what the sword was.

> *If a dying Zeus used the last of his power to create the ""god killer"" which is Diana, does that mean that just before he died his ""last power"" was the effort to have sex with the Amazon queen and impregnate her before he died?

No, Zeus didn't impregnate Hippolyta.  She sculpted Diana out of clay, and Zeus brought it to life by imbuing himself into it.  So basically Diana is what's left of Zeus.

> And also, when exactly was his last big battle with Ares when all the other gods were slaughtered and he was mortally wounded?... like 20 years before? And therefore how is the ""corruption of Ares"" in mankind explain the wars that were happening 2000 years ago in Amazonian legend?

I didn't really get the impression they were suggesting there was no war prior to Ares corrupting man.  I think you're probably looking at this a little too literally.

> *In Batman Vs Superman, Diana says ""I've fought monsters from other worlds before""... so by that, did she mean the Earth based god Ares? Or something else? Ares doesn't quite seem to match that description at all.

There's a 100 year span between the events in WW and BvS.  Certainly could be a reference to something else in there.

> *Also in BvS, Diana's character has pretty much given up on humanity, preferring not to get involved and live anonomously in the world so much that no-one is even aware that she exists.

So what happened between the end of this movie and the beginning of BvS to make her character so different in her perspective and role in it? There seems to be a movie missing in the middle here.

Well, yes and no.  At the end of the movie - in Paris - she's accepted that her responsibility is to be a protector of mankind.  They didn't necessarily imply that she came to that conclusion after killing Ares.  But it also wasn't exactly clear either, so maybe they'll go more into that aspect of her background in the inevitable sequel (maybe after killing Ares, and then seeing World War 2 pop up she would then come to her realization).",6erigc

Chekhov's gun is a dramatic principle that states that every element in a story must be necessary, and irrelevant elements should be removed; elements should not appear to make ""false promises"" by never coming into play.

""Remove everything that has no relevance to the story. If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off. If it's not going to be fired, it shouldn't be hanging there.""

""One must never place a loaded rifle on the stage if it isn't going to go off.

I don't think you or frankly *a lot* people understand how Rotten Tomatoes work, based on comments like this especially.

A 95% movie doesn't automatically means it's better than a 85% movie etc. The % just means that that's the % of critics that enjoyed the film. It doesn't reflect how *much* they enjoyed the film.

You need to look at the weighted raiting, which is a more accurate reading of how *much* critics liked it.

A 95% essentially just means, 95% of the reviewers gave the movie a ""thumbs up"". It's binary, you either give it a 'fresh' or 'rotten'.

To give a comparison:
Wonder Woman in has a 7.6/10 weighted rating. The [first Avengers film](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/marvels_the_avengers) may only have a 90% but it has an 8/10. That means it essentially has a higher rating. It means that more people gave that film a better rating so the average is higher than Wonder Woman's. That's what you should base your expectations on. If 10/10 is the maximum, a 7.6 is basically above average, but not *that* much above average. It's like a high C. (It's still high for a superhero film, though).

And I think the Charlie character was absolutely ridiculous - were they trying to do some sort of subdued wink to the Cowardly Lion in the Wizard of Oz or something with him? Just made no sense to me.

Here were my nitpicks that make my kids roll their eyes:

1> Before Diane leaves, Hippolyta says ""Once you leave, you can never return."" Why? Why can't she return? They had just established that people can literally stumble upon their island. They established a German soldier poking his head in and out of the ""barrier"" cloaking the island with no negative effects. So exactly WHY can't she come back if she wanted to? 

2> Why does she get upset and go HAM when Steve dies but doesn't go HAM when Antiope dies? I mean we see her sort of ""lose control"" when sparring with Antiope. I was expecting another ""loss of control"" or display of her greater power once Antiope get's capped considering how she seemed to be more of a mother to her than her actual mother. 

3> What's special about her armor? They told us that the tower holds all of these powerful relics. They tell us about her sword and her lasso... relics in this tower. She gets her armor from the tower as well which implies there's something special about it, but nothing is ever revealed. I mean I'm all for breaking tropes, but an origin story that totally neglects the heroes costume? Came off as  ""we couldn't come up with anything interesting about it, so we're just gonna show her grinning and stealing it.""

4> Steve Trevor being EVERYWHERE and able to infiltrate ANYTHING got ridiculous. Here's Wonder Woman fighting Ares and in the middle of a fight with the God of War Steve thinks it's a good idea to interrupt and give her his watch? 

5> I didn't understand the whole relationship with the Amazons and mankind. We're told the Amazons have basically been keeping to themselves for ages, but clearly they have to be having SOME sort of interaction or keeping tabs on humanity in SOME way to be able to have all of their languages.

A metal piece of board supported by some humans is able to launch her to enough height to get to the top of the tower? I was like wut.

As for the ending I do agree that it was bad. They teased this final fight essentially from the first minute of the movie and the countless mentions of Ares. And what happens at the end? Diana defends herself from attacks constantly without landing any good hits on him. Goes into beast mode when Steve dies but calms down almost instantly when she has a flashback of a conversation 5 minutes ago. Then all she does is use Ares' lighting (since when did the God of War use lightning?) against him which kills him.

What irked me about the ending fight was Ares not using his full set of powers. He shows us that he can disappear and reappear at different places for example. Diana too!.

It was WW1, so any politics in my opinion were focused around that era, so I consider that just a part of the setting.

Frankly all the characters had important roles to play, and weren't ignored, which is really difficult to do. 

I would love to hear what your friends meant by political.

Here's where I think it's a subversion of this trope though: much like the Sarah Connor Chronicles example of power dynamics, there's mutual naivete and discovery. Steve is completely unaware of Amazonian power and her quest to kill Ares, and Diana is discovering Man's World. Additionally, I think it's no small thing that the protagonist and point of view is a woman's, meaning she doesn't exist to boost Steve's stature. Finally, they don't fall in love because Diana is inexperienced and Steve fixates on that. Diana falls in love with him because of his will to do the right thing and save people, and Steve falls in love with her -- well, probably at first because she looks like an Amazonian goddess, but from the early boat scene you see actual chemistry between them that culminates in the dance scene. She schools him on ancient volumes of the body and pleasure, and from then on her naivete is more like a socially awkward person than a child that needs to be taken care of and nurtured.

She sees wounded soldiers begging for medical aid and again Steve stops her from helping and pushes her forward.  If Trevor wasn't there to guide her she never would have made it to the front line.  She would have been lost in the chaos and misery surrounding the battlefield attempting to rectify every injustice she saw or give aid to every wounded soldier or starving refugee.  She wanted to do *something*-- goddamnit ANYTHING at all-- because that's just the type of person she is.  Being told that the enemy was too great, that the heroes needed to go around was the last straw.  For her, turning away at that moment would have been tantamount to admitting defeat.

diu9cbp,"If you want to avoid downvotes for a controversial opinion on reddit, here's a few tricks:

1. Talk about why you feel the way you do, for more than a short statement. If you say ""I fucking hate X"" you come across to some people as contrarian, or as a troll, rather than as someone with something to say. Elaborate a bit. Instead of saying that it just feels out of place, talk about why it feels out of place. If that's your main complaint, include a statement about it not being bad on its own. 

2. Don't say ""Here come the downvotes"". That sounds insincere. 

3. Include a statement that you don't think it's wrong to like it. It's really common on the internet for people to think anyone who disagrees with their opinion are dumb, so if you come into a thread expressing an opinion contrary to what is popular, people will infer that you think they are stupid by default, and you will further be seen as a troll. 

Here's how you could have written your comment and probably avoided downvotes (This isn't an exact science, so your mileage may vary):

""I don't have any negative opinion about people who like the theme, but I just really don't like it. It seems really out of place to have this electric cello riff sound juxtaposed against a World War 1/Ancient Greek setting. It's a nice theme by itself, but it feels like it belongs in a different movie""

I like the No Mans Land sequence. I thought killi g Pine also took balls that Marvel has been lacking.       


All that said, I really hated the action. These stylized Slo Mo sequences are very distracting and at no point can you even get lost in it because it is so obviously cgi. The villains were pretty weak as well. ",6erigc

difs9lv,I agree with you in the entire first paragraph. And really everything else you said is on point too. However I think that this may all be deliberate. It seems like Wonder Woman is the optimist of the DCEU now. And after seeing Supes sacrifice herself she's inspired again. She sees that men have good and dark in them and they have to make a choice. Batman is gonna be her current day Steve Trevor. A ordinary man who fights alongside of her and try's to do good. However he has slightly fallen to the dark side. And cheesy as it is her love will make him a better man and inspire him. At least I think that's what they're setting up. An if so I think it somewhat justifys Batmans decisions in BvS. ,6erigc

Well bruce isn't a demigod like diana and clark, so he has to do something so they don't kill him. 

Still doesn't sit right with me, that he does it though. ",6erigc
dilk0z0,Even in Dark Knight Returns Batman refuses to uses Guns,6erigc
dilqudc,"I think some people miss the point of Bats (and Sups but under a different reason) is that he is old man Batman, he has grown old and bitter, he has seen those close to him die and worse, all his money, power, and ability couldn't stop that.  All those he put away couldn't change the fact of what people are capable of.

Both Superman and WW reminded Bats what it was to have mercy.  Bruce had spent so much time in the darkness, the darkness within him had captured him.  Much like what happens to police (especially if they work at night) in our day to day world.

By the end of BvS Bruce has been shown that, how he had become something he once fought, his battle in BvS was not against Superman, it was a battle against himself, against his own pain and loss.

This is why he helps Diana with the picture as you see at the beginning of WW, he understand loss, and how grief can drive you to good, but fighting evil darkens your soul when you don't have something to balance it with.

The whole point of ww1 is that no matter how hard you tried or how many lives you wasted you could never get anywhere, the second you took a trench; artillery or counterattack threw you out.

That was the whole point of steve saying ""this whole battalion has been here a year and hasnt gained an inch"" the war was bigger than anything one person or even one battalion could hope to accomplish, and really the point of that scene should have been to show wonder woman that you can't always brute force it and that this war truly is unlike anything she knows or can handle.

But not only was wonder woman proven right, there was no counter attack,no retaliatory barrage, hell the villagers, who apparently had been hiding in their houses for a year, threw a goddamn party with beer and dancing.

They hint to her having those powers at the beginning but never show her learning to use them or gaining a mastery over them that would allow her to go toe to toe with an actual god.

Being a woman is never an excuse for their failings, nor is it a reason that they're superior - they do everything the male characters do without anyone needing to discuss their gender stereotypes.

Also, I'm really hoping that this movie will prove to studios once and for all that guys, and in particular ""nerdy"" guys, are perfectly happy to see a female-lead film when it's well made, and making them the enemy both on and off the screen (\*cough\* Ghostbusters \*cough\*) is just unnecessary.",6erigc

I do wish at the very least that if they had to have him in then they had him admit he had no part in starting or influencing the war and he's just enjoying the power he's gaining from a war they started themselves, and then you could have Diana going to stop the war or destroy the gas and he stops her so he can continue growing in strength.

But Ares really did exist, and (at least in that moment) the world *was* as black and white as she thought: she kills him and the Germans wake up all happy go lucky.

I also thought that the filmmaker did an excellent job of showing that it wasn't Ares behind the war. He just helped make it worse. That humans did this and he reveled in it. I also loved the contrast at the end with the Germans removing their gas masks to reveal that they were only kids, too.

Unlike you, I felt that these ideas were conveyed pretty effectively in both Man of Steel and BvS, and to much greater impact. I especially love the way these ideas were presented in BvS, as I felt they were conveyed with a lot of subtext and tact. 

Having a Batman with very little regards to value of life translate to us as viewers how he views ""bad guys"" and shows you how strong his drive is to take down Superman. He doesn't kill unless absolutely provoked, and most of his kills come off as collateral damage. It's a price that he's willing to pay, and it's the first step one takes toward a path of ""villainy"". He becomes the definition of vigilante, one who acts and judges unilaterally, an idea that is a primary concerns of everyone when it comes to Superman. Why is Superman a threat? Not because he does good, but because we don't know why. Is he good because he's actually good? or does he have ulterior motives. What Batman doesn't realize at the beginning, which he ultimately understands, is that in his quests to really find out he becomes the very thing he fears. He made compromises to his morals because he has been beaten down so much that he feels that this is the only way to achieve what he sets out. The line where he says that if there's even 1% chance that Superman could be evil that he would have to take it as an certainty is very important in understanding Batman's state of mind. That's the attitude of a villain and not of a hero. ""Martha"" is important because his parents' deaths, and on a deeper psychological level, his mother's death, affect him deeply. They become the absolute ideal that he based his entire life around. This idea that was meant to be incorruptible, became corrupted, because of the inception of ""the Superman"". Superman is a stone in the pond that causes ripples that set a lot of ideas in motions. In Essence, both Batman and Lex Luthor are separate sides of the same coins. Their plans were both set in motion by the a monumental appearance of a god like being with seemingly unlimited power. That power was demonstrated on Metropolis, in which Batman was personally affected. How they dealt with depended on where they came from. There's a lot of metaphors at play here, and that's the level that Snyder wants to tell his stories. These are stories of Gods and men, and of Corruptible absolutes. A lot of abstract ideas that are not immediately understood on initial viewing. I don't think many took the time, or bothered, to think about it. A lot of criticism I feel came from the immediate gut reaction that the heroes on screen don't align with the accepted canon that was perpetuated for years. But the internal struggle of Batman of not becoming the villains he preyed has always been central to the character,  which the film stayed absolutely true to. ",6erigc

> Diana is the only child on Paradise Island.....

Valid point all around, though it could have been cleaner if they'd just avoided Diana and Steve talking about sex. That dialogue opens a can of worms that isn't properly addressed.

> Diana is stubborn, headstrong, and naive.....

While the movie has its own spin on the character, much like Man of Steel and BvS before it, I still found it jarring that she's essentially a 5 year old Captain Obvious that claims if we all hug each other, the war will end. Like no fucking shit. Ideals are good and all, but you can still voice them in a more subtle/adult manner. Act like a child, and you'll be dismissed like one. Get out. (that's the english talking to Diana, not me to you)

> The reason to root for Diana is not because she is always in trouble, but because her quest seems so hopeless.

I strongly disagree. You have to communicate the struggle the protagonist faces to the audience. Whether that is physical, mental, emotional, spiritual or whatever. Since this is a superhero action/adventure and Wonder Woman is first and foremost a physical heroine, as opposed to say Zatanna who use magic, it makes sense that Diana would struggle with combat.

She's fresh from boot camp, the beaching on Paradise Island was probably her first real battle. Certainly the first one where she faces a modern army. One thing the movie did well was gradually escalate the combat, from alley shoot out, to pub fight, to no mans land, to village and so on. So again, it makes sense that she learns, adapts, adjusts and so on. Point is, let her make mistakes or let us feel that she is at risk. Make no mistake, this is a problem I have with multiple movies. Superhero movies are the easiest target for this flaw, because many of the heroes are build up to be (near) perfect, larger than life and can handle anything. Man of Steel and BvS have IMO the same problem; no risk, no tension, no stakes, no engagement. From me at the very least.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWqyNE6ok14) explains very well what I felt that Wonder Woman was lacking. And how other movies have used it to great affect. Nolan's Batman movies and Marvel manages to get this right, to one extent or another. The spotless look of the hero, right after battle, just make it so jarring and distracting.

> Diana has no reason to be smart, nor tactical. 

She's the princess. She'll presumably inherit the throne, yes? Don't they want smart people to lead their fine nation? Isn't half the point of Diana that she's the best of the best of an already badass elite all female warrior culture? She lectured british generals for cowering behind desks when they should, according to her, be out there in the field of battle. Commanding and leading directly. If that doesn't require some idea of tactics and strategy, then I don't know what will. Diana needs to put her mouth where her money is, unless she wants to come across as a hypocrite. 

> Regarding your last points, I think you missed a part of the dialogue. 

**I want to be wrong, believe I really do.** But I honestly do not recall. She was told the bedtime story about Zeus, Ares and the gods. How her mother formed her from clay and prayed to Zeus, a prayer that was answered. I recall that there were foreshadowing about how Diana didn't know the full truth, a truth that Ares told her when he confronted her. But I honestly cannot recall that Diana's mother admitted that she got pregnant with Diana. Also, why the hell hide that? The fuck, she knows where babies come from and is well versed in the pleasures of the flesh. Because she wants Diana to be ""normal?"" Damnit, she's already the ONLY fucking child on the whole island. She's special by default.

I will not however, go for a second screening of the movie, just to get this confirmed. For that, the movie simply isn't good enough. ",6erigc
dji1dss,"> That kinda makes sense, at least according to the comics. The rest of the citizens have been there for thousands of years. Diana is something ""new"".

Please refrain from playing the ""in the comics"" card. The movie should be able to stand on its own two legs without asking the audience to know what was said in issue #24, page 4, panel 6. 

If memory serves me, one of the last things the dying Zeus did was hide Paradise Island, which presumably happened thousands of years ago. I could be wrong, but I find it unlikely that dead gods can answer prayers, so Zeus had to give Diana life before he died. Possibly shortly after he raised/created the barrier. This makes Diana thousands of years old and not something new. 

Also, we have no outside reference from Diana's childhood. Is it 1890? Or 200 B.C.? I have no idea. Which plays into later when she interacts with the British generals.

> The theme of the beginning of the movie is that Hippolyta is an overly protective mother, who is reluctant to see her only daughter go out to do what she must do.

I agree that the whole ""deny her destiny for her own protection"" spin works well with the Greek mythological feel, but they approached it from the wrong angle. As I suggested, it'd be better for her to be trained, but unlike any other Amazon, Diana has a hunger for the world outside. This is where her mother draws the line, this is what they should disagree on. Not whether the princess of a warrior culture should know how to hold a sword.

> She's also a precocious young woman. I'm not seeing any problem here.

I seem to recall that Diana insisted that she's well read and educated. I don't feel that what she claims and what she does are not in sync, even if I were to give her some leeway for the cultural/time clash. Also, Diana's age is brought into question as we have no idea just when she was born. Diana could be 20 years old or 300 years old when she arrives in London. I suppose you could argue it's not a big deal, but the devil lies in little details like these. Or at least I feel that they do.

> Yeah, true. Welcome to Hollywood. It's still an awesome scene.

Easily the most iconic, though there's plenty of room for improvement.

> This is her journey...

Which is fair enough, I just felt that they could have approached it differently. Diana argues time and time again that the war will stop dead in its tracks the moment she kills Ares. So while she does bring relief to one village (that Steve isn't even sure is on the darn map), hundreds, if not thousands suffer elsewhere and they'll suffer longer because Diana took what we're told to be a detour. 

> y'know, we do see Ares playing both sides. It's just the people on the British/American side we see him playing aren't comic book villains.

Sorry, but I didn't feel that was good enough. He still came out of nowhere and tossed out some loose rationale for why he hadn't stomped her like a bug when they first met.

> HUGE SPOILER

As much as I want to believe you, does Ares CONFIRM that Diana was born like any other child? Because I honestly do not remember. Diana being a goddess isn't the problem. A god can be created from a clay sculpture. BUT then Diana is created with a spesific purpose/destiny in mind and as far as her first grand adventure into the world goes, she has no choice. She has to fight Ares. She does not fight him because it is the right thing to do. She fights him because it is her destiny and no one, not even the gods can defy destiny.

Her mother is protective because she destined to fight against the God of War, not destined to defeat him. The outcome of the fight that Diana cannot avoid is uncertain. That is what have mother dearest worried sick. Or at least, that's how I understood it.",6erigc

- How we the audience are told that Diana is the only child is handled clumsy. Such exposition would have been better to simply show (*only young Diana and adult women*) rather than told through awkward dialogue (*Be careful Diana, you're the only child on the island... or something along those lines*).

- It made me wonder why does Amazons have sex-ed? There are no men on the island and they're all blessed with long lives (or straight up immortality), rendering reproduction moot.

- The whole sex-ed talk is brought up because Steve questions something we the audience already know because of the fairy tale Diana's mother told earlier. If this is meant to foreshadow that Diana was made the *""good ol' fashion way""* rather than sculpted out of clay, I found it clumsy and confusing in its execution.

- If memory serves me, the sex-ed talk also tied into the fact that Diana is well read and educated. Apparently only in certain fields, since she's utterly ignorant in terms of diplomacy, tact, tone, warfare, tactics and strategy. Things you'd expect a princess in a monarchy would know, especially one that is a warrior culture through and through.

dk6q9yx,"Reflecting more on my original post and yours, I'm happy to accept that there could be otherworldly factors that contribute to Diana's beauty. She is of course a celestial being as you remind me. To be clear, I can understand the producers not wanting to make Wonder Woman into a WW1 movie (and so naturally, they would not concentrate on the grimier details of trench warfare). My question is though: how can someone who seems to be immune from bullets, filth, disease, trauma and pain/death in general authentically conclude from their experience on 20th Century battlefield that war is hell? Real life Princess Diana understood first hand what pain and suffering was.

The suspicion that I am beginning to draw from our discussion is that films are better served when they understand how their characters' identity can affect the story being told. To use an even more fantastical example, Clark Kent is an immortal alien being. Everyone can easily accept that he can fly, shrug off bullets, punch through walls and shoot laser beams from his eyes. It would have been clumsy if the Superman series was about how he mechanically struggles to defeat his enemies. So instead the story is more naturally about how he confronts, in spite of his gifts, the fact that he can't really save everyone. Wonder Woman, even though Diana is similarly gifted, doesn't have this same storytelling elegance. 
 
To illustrate further by contrast how authenticity (or lack thereof) affects Wonder Woman as a film, consider the recent X-Men films. By not shielding Magneto from the trauma of the holocaust, the question that he raises (is there a point to which humans can be so different that they become intolerable to the world?) propagates naturally all the way to Logan. You instantly know when Charles Xavier is giving his final answer to this question and the filmmakers don't even need to show Magneto on the screen. Along the way, the series got a rich story line of vengeance and loss essentially for no effort as a result. Disclaimer: I didn't like X-Men: Apocalypse as much.
 ",6erigc
dk5yseo,"I guess it is true that Wonder Woman fills that glass-half-full niche that seems to be the minority for superhero films. Perhaps I am not the target audience for this style of film. I do tend to like sterner toned superhero films (the Christopher Nolan series of Batman has been my favourite for a long time). This is specifically because I think its too easy for these kinds of films to turn from eventual feel good story to flat out wish fulfillment. Watching his trilogy, I never once thought Christopher Nolan let what was/was not palatable to the general public constrain the story he wanted to tell. Unfortunately I can't pay Wonder Woman the same complement.  

> Finally, this was a landmark achievement for a female director and a female character.

Though this is not that big of a selling point for me, I can see why it may be for some women.

digkpao,"During the first battle on Themyscira, every Amazon seems to get her time in the sense that they were individually shown being killed (again, with excessive, overly dramatic slow-mo shots), but as a whole, I felt like there was not enough time for the audience to grieve or fully process their feelings about what is going on. When you think about it, it's actually a really big deal. The Amazons were living peacefully on this hidden island for a long time. All of a sudden, outsiders bombard their paradise and slaughter many of their women. Not only does Diana have to deal with her loss, but she's also just been exposed to a world much bigger than her own and must now make a decision to leave her home, where she basically spent her entire life and where all of her loved ones are, to embark on this epic mission in uncharted territory, all with the idea that she is unable to ever come back. This is a huge turning point for Diana, but I was unable to empathize with what she was going through until after the movie, when I really took the time to think about it. 

In light of your comment, I'll adjust mine to say that yes, the film spent a lot of time on everything, but I don't think they spent enough time on the right things. Certain moments should have more weight than others. For me, the big character defining moments for Diana are:

* Introduction of outsiders to Themyscira, resulting in a tragic loss, and Diana's decision to leave home to find Ares and save mankind (inciting incident)
* Diana crossing No Man's Land and saving the village
* Diana killing Ares and realizing that it's not as black and white as mankind being inherently all good and simply being corrupted by one big bad villain
* Steve Trevor's sacrifice, which reminds Diana that there is still good in mankind and they are worth fighting for
* Honorable Mention - the death of the villagers, which Diana sees as being Steve's fault since he stopped her from killing Ares. It really shakes up Diana's faith in mankind and heightens the conflict.

In a perfect movie, all scenes should hold some value and contribute to the main story, but these specific scenes are very significant and must build on top of each other so that when you get to the final confrontation, the resolution is more gratifying. Instead, the story would just continue to plow forward without the emotional weight of these plot points fully settling in, causing your foundation to be rocky for the epic finale. Out of these major plot point, I thought that only the No Man's Land scene and Steve's death were given the weight it deserved. The third point was criminally unexplored imo. That moment was such a big blow to all that Diana stood for. Of course, I don't want the film to linger too long to the point where it causes the story to drag, but Diana needed to struggle with the concept a little bit more before you got to the final battle.",6erigc
dj2w72k,"I don't know. I think the whole idea of Wonder Woman being the weapon was pretty silly as well. Giving her an ""it's your destiny"" role goes contrary to her independent character. One of the themes I got form Diana as a character was that she did what she wanted to do/what was right. Training as a kid, leaving the island, storming the German lines etc. Just my opinion. 

>Dr. Poison's character was very well done, I thought, in that her implied motives were understandable and human (I can't stress this enough, she was one of my favourite characters). Her acting in such a way would have gone against that.

Fair enough. I kind of thought her character was forgettable. To me, she really didn't have any defining characteristics other than wanting to hurt people. I also agree that ending would be pretty cliche as well. The main reason I proposed it was because it would have actually agreed with the idea of how to defeat war itself. 

>Ares actually being Zeus makes much more sense, especially with the lightning and the fact that the god of War wanted to kill humans to make ... peace? What? 

I'm liking this ending the more I think about it. Aesthetics aside, it would have actually given Diana more of a dilemma. Ares was the God she was always told was the bad guy, and he's doing things that appear to be bad. Why would she join him? Zeus on the other hand, is the hero in their mythology. Would have also given more rationality to the idea that he wants to restore paradise. I still like the first ending more, as it makes the villein of the movie something you can't defeat by just punching it really hard. But we can have a difference of opinion :) 

>Another bit of reasoning near the end that felt very weak to me was the focus on love.

To be honest, I think that focusing on the general or sexual type of love would have seemed silly. The only kind that really would have mattered was the self-sacrificing love. For that to happen, it couldn't have been Trevor who died due to the sexual component of their relationship. I guess that's kind of why I was hoping one of the supporting bad guys would have a change of heart. There isn't any conflict in relationships, just pure, self-sacrificing love for people that person couldn't have even known about. 

>I hesitate to call it a disappointment.

I think we're getting some problems with ambiguity. I don't mean that I was completely disappointment or thought the movie was crap. If we're going to make a list of all the things they did right and all the things they did wrong, more things would be on the right list. But that really isn't how I see movies. It was the fact that they did so many things right, and then dropped all of them at the end of the movie that made it so disappointing for me. The fact that the ending was so bad made all the great things about the beginning and middle less impressive simply because they didn't see it through. So not only did I get a cliche ending, I also had to leave the movie theater with a bunch of unanswered questions that I really wanted the movie to resolve. That's what made me disappointment. Anyways, always glad to hear the thoughts of other people. Thanks for sharing!",6erigc
dj9nai9,"I think Ares was wrong about humans not that we're completely devoid of bloodlust, but that the only way to truely stop war is to rise above that desire to destroy and take what we want. I agree that Dr. Poison is cheezy, and certaintely not the way I would want it to end ideally. But she and General lubberdude were the only people I could really see being completely with Ares (unknowingly). Maybe an unnamed German soldier does it, I'm not super fussed about who does it. I just got annoyed that apparently the way to stop war is to shoot it with a bunch of lightning. 

The reason I liked the first part was because I got an immedeate feel for who Diana was as a charcacter. It was explained with her actions instead of exposition. I'm a fan of showing over telling. Her desire to learn to fight highlighted her tendency towards getting her way by force and her indepenence and general lack of respect for authority. I was reallllly hoping that the Godkiller wouldn't have worked, but for entirely different reasons. Kind of harkening back to the idea of war itself as the enemy, I think that it would have been a great charcacter arc for Diana to learn that not all problems can be dealt with by punching or stabbing the bad guys really hard. 

Anyways, just the thoughts of some random redditor. I guess I liked the early parts because I saw a setup for some really interesting storytelling and charcacter development. Ending was dissapointing because it was such a bland ending to what I thougth was an interesting story. ",6erigc

dij5ee7,"It was all of the audio/visual stuff that went along with that moment that made it really special for me, it's sort of hard to describe.

The Captain America films do an okay job of capturing that feeling I'm (poorly) describing here, but they sort of fall flat because it's too easy to point at who the bad guy is. It's Nazis/Red Skull, it's Ultron, it's Hydra, whatever. In the films the Avengers are always after ONE person/organization. To steal from the films, they are the boot to the ant so to speak. There is an obvious problem and they snuff it out. This makes for a good movie but it's not what these characters stories were originally *about* when they were first introduced to the world.

Superheroes aren't supposed to be glorified counter-terrorist or S.W.A.T. teams. They are supposed to be paragons of social justice, going out of their way to improve the world and help everyone in it because *it's the right thing to do*, and because they believe that, if someone else could do what they could, they would choose to do the same.

I'm sorry if I'm rambling, I'm still waking up, but I think it's the distinction between:

A) The ENTIRE world is being threatened by an evil wizard who plans to destroy everything on it in 48 hours. I have to stop him to save the world!

and

B) People are sick/going hungry. People are fighting and killing each other for seemingly no reason. They are afraid. I could sit back and just live my life, or I could *do something about it*.

Avengers are A. Wonder Woman was B, and that's what a real superhero is.

I didn't get either of those messages at all from this movie.  She was told by both her mother and by Ares that *mankind* didn't deserve her, and she realized that that's more than a little bit true.  However, she forged friendships with a group of people who were liars, thieves, and smugglers (i.e. ""bad"" people), and fell in love with a man who she watched sacrifice himself for thousands of others out of his love for humanity.    Diana follows his example, and chooses to act not because mankind deserves her help, but because she loves and believes in humanity.  

Diana watches a good man, one she happened to maybe love, sacrifice himself for countless others--a sacrifice that every one of them didn't necessarily deserve, but got anyway.  She's been so concerned with saving ""innocents"" for the whole movie only to find out that it's more complicated than that--that most humans aren't completely ""innocent"" by her original definition.

Which was what happened if we exclude the Ares is real but not really the cause of everything shtick, only we got an old guy in a classy moustache screaming at the screen. 
Either the movie lost more time to make the reveal feel unexpected but inevitable, or it just cut Ares from the equation. This felt like a cheap, ham fisted way of still having a superpowered over the top duel on the final act. Felt really out of place just like the Dr. Poison and the silly general dialogue with giggles ""oh my God we're so evul"". I don't have anything against ham fisted dialogue, I loved Tengen Topps Gurren Lagan as much as anyone else. But it doesn't fit with the serious war story they're trying to portray. We could make a good movie but this is supposed to be a comic book movie so let's insert this shit that doesn't really fit.  
Up the war realism, which should be possible under the same age bracket. Keep the plot without the Ares part. Have the finale be her realizing humans are worse saving anyway and having to go save another village or something equally epic while the spy(I'm bad with names) deals with the poison. It's implied they should both be sacrificing themselves but Diana awakes her goddess powers and an outburst stops the fighting.

She goes in without trying to explain anymore. They've been stuck in fear for a year at the trenches, and here is someone who is no longer scared, doesn't need more information, knows it's the right thing and just goes. 

She embodies that kind of feminine power (aka driven by love of others) by her very nature, just like the scorpion and the frog fable her mom mentions. People find out who they are by their actions, not their supposed thoughts or ideas of themselves -- the scorpion stings, one man is a hero, another man is a coward, etc.

The emotional part of that scene is that by being who you are in your actions, you help others find the best in themselves-- like all the soldiers who charged and rallied after. 

It's also why the 'love' thing makes sense but it needed a more precise line because we are too jaded by the ""Power of Love"" as an invisible hand fiction cliche. The fight was supposed to show her realization that  it's not 'LOVE' in the big sense that will save the world because as we saw, the inclination for war is not simply the ""God of War"" but the little war in each man's heart that tips the scales of what society will do. So it has to be love at the small interpersonal level that can cinch our nature towards the good among all the reasons and temptations to be bad. Now that the very last of the olympian gods are dead, there are no excuses to hide behind, we must take responsibility and bear our suffering.

Her epiphany was not that people are dark and violent by nature. That was the truth that Ares tried (and briefly succeeded) to get her to accept. Her epiphany was that love means accepting their bad side along with the good, and deciding to save them anyway. But since that is the case, to then turn around and kill in the name of love would be a violation of that.

I suppose they had to use what they had to work with in terms of the costume, the [original](https://comicbookbrain.com/_imagery/2013-12-27/wonder-woman-1978-aparo01.jpg) was not exactly what I would want to be wearing into a fight if I was a woman either. At least this one looked as though it was actually made of some kind of armour and I suppose the Greek [influence](https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10_Facts_Greek_Hoplites_6.jpg) was kind of evident. As for her looks, she is a literal Goddess according to the film. On the subject of her looks though, I think it would have been best if, okay she is a divine being so she is going to look stunning. But she is also a warrior, would it have been such a shame to have Gal Gadot have hit the weights? I am sure she works out a lot to have that physique, but it probably should have been more MMA and less catwalk. 

All of which is to say,  I agree with you and think the problems you listed would have been forgivable given the context and history of the character if she had been more of a character. Now that you have got me on it, I tried listing her character traits. She is determined, a little naive to start with and has a strong moral compass. That's as much depth as I could give. We don't really know anything else. 

Batman for example still had to deal with bringing his, let's be honest, ridiculous costume to the big screen. It always worked when he was a good character and we were able to look past the fact that we were rooting for a lunatic who dressed up like a bat.

dicosfv,"I feel that's because they had 2 entirely different goal's. 

WW wanted to stop all war's and save everyone.

Steve Roger's wanted to fight for his country, kill German's(at first) and save his friend's.

WW ideology is from a hero. wanting to save everyone, Steve Roger's is from a Solider wanting to defeat the enemy and protect his country/Friend's.

and WW1 is in general a much better way of telling a war story that WW2. WW2 has a very clearly antagonist. where as WW1 is much more grey if you actually read up on it, the German's getting blamed for WW1 is complete Bullshit and was why they were outraged at the armstance treaty. Britain is just as much at fault as Germany is for WW1.

World War II on the other hand as VERY clear evil. Mussolini, Hitler are very clearly the bad guy's. the Nazi's are Prick's who need to be stopped. Problem is that majority of the German military where no different that the US, or Britain. they fought for their country and believed they needed to fight to protect their friend's, and Family. Sound's Familiar huh?

Captain America Fails at this because it doesn't touch this fact, WW does. it's just amazing in that way. Diana believes that the German's are not bad people, and even accusing Steven of being a bad person as much as the German's, a big part of her whole wanting to kill Ares is to save the German's who are fighting, because she still believes that they are good people. and at the end she is proven correct. 

TBH the whole moral of the movie is that Ares, isn't the Antagonist. he isn't a hero. but he is at best a secondary boss, the Antagonist of the movie is just what the Antagonist of WW1 actually was:

I get it, Diana learns something from her relationship and feelings for Steve, but ""I believe in the power of love"" just seems so cheesy and unexpected to me. 

The only way I can see that justifies the whole power of love thing is that Diana was tempted to raze people because they're proven to be violent and bad even without Ares' influence, and didn't, instead choosing the good path because she sees that humans can be good too, Steve Trevor's love for her proved that. But she didn't look like she was having an internal struggle throughout the movie. She seems wholly optimistic and sure. 

Or maybe the whole thing was done badly? I kinda see now how the power of love makes sense but her saying that out right just takes me out of it. Maybe if it's done in a more subtle way, it'd be okay, but what's done is done. ",6erigc

Then after the end of WWII, there was the Cold War and for decades it seemed that the world was on the brink of destruction. And that's not even going into the Holocaust and Unit 731.

Then there's all the other failures of humanity that has happened in the century since WWI: Vietnam, Korea, Cambodia, Rwanda, Congo, Birmingham, AL, Bay of Pigs, Afghanistan, assassinations of presidents and civil rights leaders, 9/11, etc. There were plenty of things in between WWI and BvS where Diana would have completely lost faith in humanity.",6erigc

He literally just existed to be the enemy and had zero character or motivation outside of 'designated bad dude' but it was fine because the rest of the movie worked. Indeed, part of the reason he sucked was because that missing character development was given to the protagonists instead (and they did a great job of it)

The most annoying thing about cliches is if you're using them, you *know exactly* what the audience expects, and it's the easiest thing in the world to play with those expectations to generate interest. You don't even have to change the destination, the classic cliche can still trigger, but you shouldn't be sitting in a film knowing exactly what's going to happen. With everyone. All the time.

I actually enjoyed Ares's armor and the weapons he made. I'd have hope his character would have morph into a ""true"" form that was more intimidating and well a more Greek looking person.

The third act was messy but the turning her to the dark side was much more believable than I felt in Star Wars since she really did see the horrors they could cause on their own. I just they could have contrasted the worse and the best humanity has to offer throughout the film. I thought a scene of her seeing a baby and a mother would be a quick moment of how much love humanity could offer. I felt that should have been a larger central theme in this film. Especially with Charlie, it was clear he'd scene some shit and I thought they'd point out that he can't shoot anyone if he can see their faces.

Superman: Man of Steel

Suicide Squad (which IMO I have a hard time connecting to the overall DCEU because there's only really two of them have any SUPER powers)
Wonder Woman
Justice League. The FIFTH movie. 

DC seem to have a hard on for pushing as much as possible as quickly as possible. This, IMO is one of the main reasons why DCEU movies are so bad, WW excepted. They're trying to cram way too much in far too quickly. Marvel movies plant seeds, DC plant big fucking trees in their movies. They have no clue about subtlety, suggestion or anticipation.

IMO there should have been at least two more movies in there before JL. A standalone Batman movie, ideally before BvS DoJ.

In that regard I totally agree, WW does depict a more scarring view of war because it is integral to developing WW as a character. 

I have to disagree about WW's team. Any development they got was very shallow. I feel like they started to try to develop them and then cut them out or copped out. Only sameer got some real lines. With cap 1 I think they made the smart decision of focusing on cap and carter, and some solid fleshing out for bucky and howard stark. The howling raiders were an awesome cameo to see and I think they did I good job of showing that they were badass without spending too much time on them.

dimr4mv,">     This was a hugely important moment for WW. She shows her generosity and compassion: two of her most valuable traits when it comes to how she'll work with the Justice League. 

I do see that, but we see her characters growth afterwards to being less emotional and more practical. Her actions, while saving many lives at first, were futile in the long run. All Superheroes in film have done this. Doing what's best for the small people in the now rather than rushing to save the world in the most practical manner.

It showed her inexperience with big choices, but as a character she wouldn't develop very well if she was already perfect. A lesson has to be learned and she did eventually learn hers.

Man of Steel had similar issues by portraying Clarks character as more sympathetic and human in dream sequences, scenes that aren't needed in the middle of the film at five different times throughout, it slowed the movies pace down considerably and after that third one(The tornado scene) we didn't need anymore. We know Clark is a good person thanks to his upbringing, he's closed off and protective, and he restrains his strength a lot so he doesn't hurt anyone. Another great thing about MoS is that they do explain his powers to a degree, which they don't in WW.

Collectively, IMO, the films are good. I wouldn't say great but they're not horrible. DoJ I actually found boring and for the same reasons I didn't like parts of MoS. I loved MoS for about an hour, and then flashback after flashback and slow long winded talks with people and under developed side characters and even less explanation for the Kryptonian rebels. I actually fell asleep the first time I watched it. When it came to the battle scenes, it was cool but at that point it wasn't really worth it for me. IT was big and loud but too much and all for 15 lousy minutes combined.

WW definitely works thanks to the lack of flashback scenes between the present plot and it gives many characters time to shine and it actually humanizes WW which I loved. She saw the world as Black and White because of the Amazons telling her that it's Good vs Evil, but the world is Grey. Charlie maybe a coward for killing his foes from afar but at least he does so to save lives. Salim maybe a liar but he does so because it entertains and helps others. Chief maybe a greedy person for profiteering from both sides, but he does so to help his own people. Dianas opinions of them changed when she learned why they do so much bad. ",6erigc
dinm43i,"Well it would have been nice if it was. We weren't told about the Bracelets, no explanation about her strength and speed. Just that she was trained as a warrior. We didn't learn how the magic exactly works, just that she uses it with no prior knowledge to why.

The training explains her skills but not her strength, speed, and powers.

The same problem occurred in Man of Steel. No explanation to how his heat vision works or why he has it. No explanation for why he can fly. We only learned that their gravity is weaker, the suns radiation strengthens his body, and atmosphere is richer than on krypton and that's why he is so strong.",6erigc

Modern cinema or comic book villains don't laugh at being evil for the sake of being evil.

That cackling over doing something wrong just seemed so... Childish.

Don't forget other things like how the spy guy blew up an entire factory by dropping a hand bomb through a window. Nowhere near anything explosive. Then the entire plant went up.

Or how the Eindecker he was flying, a *very* short range, *very* primitive fighter/scout, somehow made it across the Mediterranean to an area where ships never sailed (else the island would have been found long ago) and he apparently sank a destroyer off screen.

That's part of the reason I love movies that make me think. Like last year, Nerve was one of the best movie experiences I had, simply because of how grounded it was. Sure it's still ridiculous, but it *felt* real, which was more than I could say for Jason Bourne, which was ridiculous.  ",6erigc

I feel like a lot of parts to push this were contrived, the scottish guy literally didn't serve a purpose besides one line of dialogue at the end about how he's fighting his own battle (to push the agenda of war and ethics) for example. I think one thing that bugs me is how absolutely poorly they handled the message you said is what makes it praiseworthy",6erigc
diw435i,"The nature of man, war, and ethics is all thrown out the window when it turns out Ares was real and making the war happen...

Even the German soldiers at the end were hugging people that were just shooting at them on the airstrip just to show that the mean old man in the sky made them do it.

diwaelp,"TBH, I don't think the futility of war was the best part of the movie but how her character is full of hope despite all the shit that was happening is what was nice.

About the other points: I still think that the 3 and 4 is BS a little bit and that the reason for them was to make a better climax for the story and because they had to levae WW alone since she is the main character not a group of Amazons, but as I said your answer cleared things out so I think you might be right about those.

But for the last one I disagree. It is the 1940s, Steve is just a normal person from England (or USA? I don't know) and he got into the middle of the FREAKING ANCIENT GREEK MYTHOLOGY, okay that's true that he experienced it first hand, but still, I think it is not something you take this calm.

They were neither the best shot nor the best edited, but I think they may be among the best choreographed. Probably not what that person was getting at, but it's something. I was a bit let down by all the slow-mo because I think it over-emphasized the acrobatics of what Diana was doing, while under-emphasizing the *speed* with which she was doing it, which I think might have come across as the coolest part if they actually took some time to show it to us. 

For example, there's a moment when they're taking back the town where she kicks a soldier in the head with her right leg, while using the motion of her body, and her left leg, to disarm him (he had picked up her sword). While it was very apparent what she was doing thanks to the slow-mo, I don't think it was nearly as impressive to watch as if they had let us see that same move at regular speed. It was a really cool move, and to see it at full speed would have really driven home not only how *good* she is, but how fast and smart she is...that's not only quick thinking, but smart fighting, and we really don't get that feeling from it at all because of the presentation speed.

I suspect that the slow motion was really meant to emphasize exactly what I'm complaining it didn't, to be honest (in much the same way it is used to visualize ""Spidey sense"" in Spiderman).

They only ever say that. They don't actually show that. What they do show is the Germans being bad guys. The only times the Allied are shown to be bad are when they are whipping the horses, and the fact that their leaders aren't willing to risk the Armastice to save thousands of lives (but I'd say that's a weak one since leaders being pompous self interested assholes is nothing new).

I'm with you on that one. I didn't think it dragged on too much. If anything it was my favorite part of the film.

> There's a difference there though. The Diana and Sameer scene needed subtitles because the whole point was that non of the others can understand them. As for the rest of the German scenes all I can say is this is a 100 million dollar plus movie aimed at a general audience. Excessive subtitles really isn't a viable option.

I agree that's why they did it, but equally films *can* be successful with subs. Apocalypto made three times it's 40 million budget and *the entire film* was subbed.

> There's plenty of clues that Sir Patrick was Ares during the film. I think the biggest mistake they made was having him with that mustache during the flashback. If he'd had a full beard then his mustache under the helmet wouldn't have looked so silly. (small details but they really matter).
I just think if Houstan's character was going to be a red herring then that twist was always going to feel a bit hollow. But then again I like the idea that Houstan's character was just a man pushing to keep the war going rather than Ares doing it in such a direct way.

What are the plenty of clues if I may ask? The only clue I saw (keeping in mind that I watched the film *knowing* that he was Ares) was the first time we meet him. Having that close up of him hinted at something.

Asides from that he seems like a fairly straightforward friendly good natured superior who wants to do the right thing.

She was supposed to realize that Ares isn't the cause of all war, and that's why she has doubt and walks away from humans. That would have put Wonder Woman squarely in the grimmer, more angsty tone of Man of Steel and BvS. But the critical failure of those films caused DCEU to course correct, and try to make a more traditional, uplifting superhero film, potential contradictions between BvS and Wonder Woman be damned. So now that it's happened, is there any way to try to paper over the differences in the two films? It's a minor enough thing that I think most viewers probably won't notice or care.

If that's true, that's pretty damn cool.

That treaty was The Treaty of Versailles, commonly cited by historians as one of the main reasons behind WW2. It was harsh on Germany, and plunged them into bankruptcy as they gave back land, paid reparations, and accepted responsibility for the war. 

So Germany decided the best way to heal their country and get stronger was to build up their military and plunge back into war.

Perhaps that was Ares' backup plan? Then Diana saw that humans weren't free of his influence after death, and she saw the holocaust which was worse and more calculated than anything she saw in Belgium.

I could definitely see that as the reason she left the world behind. It would be cool if Wonder Woman had come out earlier, and Wonder Woman 2 could have shown WW2 and come out after BvS, that would then immediately inform the viewer of why Diana changed so drastically.",6erigc

In DC, they are generally a superhero trying to be a ""normal"" person.

In that respect, things that make the characters more human and/or vulnerable (romantic interest) is what provides that necessary extra dimension to them that helps give them credibility.

If it was an all action movie, then it wouldn't have been much of an origin story and would essentially be white-noise in this climate of super-hero movies.

As they flesh out the justice league, I expect more grandiose action sequences, but they will still inject those scenes that investigate the humanity of the heroes as that's part of what makes DC... DC.",6erigc

You blocked me because we were talking about Civil War a month ago and I said that I remember you from youtube comments and you said I was stalking you and blocked me(first of all I was active on reddit before you I think and 2nd of all you have the same name as a big South Indian music composer so I don't know why you got that idea).

It is basically every ensemble action film ever made but with larger stakes. Winter Solider was just a mash up of a spy espionage with a on the road thriller with a messy as fuck 3rd act(that was generic at the same time and the movie lost all it's potential).

All but 3 of the films you mentioned are by the number in terms of directing, writing and characters. I would forgive the latter if the first bit is not generic(like with Logan).

Her accent on screen and off screen (gadots) does not change. Not to mention, I remember hearing other background actors have an american accent when speaking so before robins character spoke, I assumed she would use her american accent but she spoke differently.

This is also why I really hate that RT is the sort of standard people hold to films, it usually makes people overpraise mediocre films and really hate other mediocre films just below it.  90% of people can agree that a film was a 6.0/10 and it will get a 90%, whereas 90% of people can agree that a film was a 5.9/10 and it'll get a 10%.  So in a lot of cases, you get this weird contrast between really high and really low ratings with slightly better than mediocre films.",6erigc

dij8nv0,"They downvoted because they felt offended by the first part of my comment. Which I stand by, because that's quite literally what it was. It was DC using their version of Thor, a hero from another land/world thrown into the midst of humanity, in a setting and plot ridiculously similar to The First Avenger.

Both movies have plenty of similarities with WW:

1. Attractive lead superhero, with attraction moreso at the core of the character the others

2. Hero is comically stoic and holds strong values, makes fun of humanity for our shortcomings, and is based on ancient mythology

3. Hero is thrown into a ""fish out of water"" scenario where the human lead must guide them through our unfamiliar customs

4. Hero is in a world war, and wishes to fight for valiant reasons

5. Hero assembles a ragtag elite team and they spearhead their side's attacks

6. Hero wants to stop comically evil big bad's plan to unleash otherworldly havoc upon humanity

7. Hero (at least one of the leads) sacrifices himself by **flying a plane with a bomb away from all the people, honorably sacrificing his own life**.

8. Hero lives to the 21st century and continues to serve as the steadfast protector of freedom and peace

And to address the hugging scene, I don't accept that they knew at all what was happening. It was made clear that Ares' meddling was confined to subtly whispering into the ears of key individuals. He never made himself known and planted himself quite discreetly among the humans. He only revealed himself before the final battle, during the intimate conversation with Diana prior to the actual fighting, so none of the soldiers would have heard it.

And it's a big stretch to assume that amidst all the explosions and death the soldiers were able to listen in enough on their mid-battle exchange to get anything close to a decent idea of what was going on. It was just completely out of place, because as the dust settled they should have been in shock at the sudden series of violent events that they didn't expect because they weren't a frontline unit and they had no knowledge of superhuman beings.",6erigc

There's a middle ground between no reaction and melting into a puddle of tears. There's a lot of emotion here not only because of the relationship between the two, but because Trevor is the movie's primary example of a flawed, ""wicked"" human that is ultimately good and sacrifices himself for something greater. Instead of something fitting of this situation WW, just rages out like it's a dragon ball z fight.

> it's not like it's actually a loved one.

It's the one person who believed in her even as a child to realize her dreams and potential even at the risk of running wrath of Queen Hypolitta. She probably spent just as much time with her as her actual mother. More than just a favorite teacher.

> And she had a scene where she expressed grief , when she goes to the village...

Never said that crying was a metric for good acting, and I'm not looking for a scene where she expresses grief like it's something to check off a list, but in a sad/tragic context there should be emotional weight in terms of grief.

Neither us nor Diana ever know of any godly powers until the finale, aside from her aunt ambiguously briefly saying ""you're more powerful than you know.""

I actually really dig the beat / percussion, but not a huge fan of the key signature or the choice of instrument. I also find the melody really limited. They can't seem to do much else with it and it didn't seem to come in naturally. 

Plus, it sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the score. 

That's just me though. It doesn't work for me.",6erigc
diubs6d,"I know a couple friends who feel the same way. I actually feel the opposite and here's why: In Batman V Superman we have synths and electronics all over that score. So it actually fit in way better in BvS for me because we're in a modern setting and the rest of the score has elements like it throughout.

The reason it fits for me less in the Wonder Woman film is because 1.) The setting: World War I and an Ancient Greek setting. That kind of stuff clashes so badly with that setting. Now you could totally make a fair argument that maybe it was the point for her to stick out in this environment. That is a great point but... 2.) They only utilize the instrument/ motif at very specific points that don't necessarily even underscore things that have to do with her standing out. In fact we don't hear it for the first time until midway through the fight after the emotional bit of No Mans Land (we have a hint of it during the logos though). They could have tried to incorporate the instrumentation throughout the film and while I wouldn't have liked it, it would've at least been a more conscious choice on the part of the filmmakers. That's just my opinion though. Again I totally understand why people like it, that's just specifically why it doesn't work for me.

Another thing too is that it's really difficult to do anything else with it musically. You can really only play it...and repeat it. Whereas themes like even Clarks theme from Man of Steel can be played as intricately as a solo piano all the way to a bombastic orchestra. 

From what I've read, it was really only meant to be an action cue motif and not a theme for Wonder Woman herself...but it caught on. I'm wondering (heh) what theme may have missed out on. ",6erigc

The whole point was that she's fucking *Wonder Woman.* She is capable of doing what others are not, and the larger point is that she chooses to do what she must to protect people and stop violence. No matter what.

because in BvS wonder woman was shown that she wasnt really interested in fighting for mankind for a long time, and it really doesnt fit the end of the Ares fight, because her resolution right there was otherwise, that she must user the power of 'love' to fight evil, and she must have felt validated after the cease fire, so, not enough reason to be disapointed in mankind at that moment.

djoxu4m,"It's a mans movie because A) with the exception of the main character, women take a back seat. The Amazons are back story bullshit- they're not the focus of the film. If they wanted to make something more of a woman's film, they would have made the Amazon's back story. Don't kid yourself into thinking it's a woman's film. I'm not saying it's wrong for women to like comics- but instead of forging their own path with something different and new and more outwardly women, they've taken a genre dominated by the male genre and said, ""It's a woman's genre now because we have a woman superhero."" As I mentioned, I wanted this to be a celebration of women, but it's not. Stop selling yourself (or women) short by being OK with this.

Second: I didn't make scantily clad a problem. Society did. Shit- feminists did. Ten+ years ago feminist groups complain that all comic book characters that were women were big boobs and some version of scantily clad. You know how you can compare scantily clad? Look at what the men wear. Aqua man is about to turn him into a sex symbol as well. I'm all about freedom of the body- but I'm not the rest of society nor the history of society. This movie doesn't exactly celebrate women, I'm sorry to say. It makes them appeasing to the eye for the primary comic genre fan: the guy. I mean, Jesus- feminists love when the media has women that look real. I can't think of anything farther from that then the perfect Gal Gadot.

And while you say the Amazons aren't western people- they're also a fictional people created by a western man from a even more heavily dominated male society than it is now. Think about shit before you start throwing out accusations.

Thirdly, the female bad guy for a female good guy is a common trope that they didn't go fill bore on in this film, which in a way is a compliment to the films creators. But at the same time, they still had the trope and they also didn't have a male character in a fist fight with the woman. Also, Ares, the male character was the one who orchestrated everything. He even admits in the film that he manipulates Dr Poison. So if anything this message about the bad guy is saying that men are manipulators.

Finally- WW saved a lot of lives. She's the super hero and main character. But those are throwaway acts of heroism, especially when everyone of the good guys saved some lives. WW isn't a portrayal of a strong woman anymore than Superman is of men. They're fake mythical figures. The perceived cost is nil because they're super human and the threat is human. Chris Pines character was the only person to make a real, legitimate sacrifice.

The desire for a female hero and the marketing saying she is has blinded you from the fact that she's not. She's mythical. Shit, that crappy Catwoman movie had more applicable heroism for women than this movie did.

You want a female super hero? Use one made by a woman who actually understands women and the struggle against a patriarchal society. If you have to make one up- by all means do it. ",6erigc

I don't see any hint that there's an intent for her to take over from Hippolyta, indeed in an environment in which everyone is more or less immune from aging (but apparently not completely immortal) the concept seems unlikely.

The movie reveals - Ares reveals - what her actual purpose is. Her mother apparently is reluctant for her to be that person, and does what she can to discourage that.

> I want to be wrong, believe I really do

OK, it's been three weeks since I saw it, so I'm going from memory, but the scene progresses something along these lines:

- Diana [tries to stab Ares with Godkiller sword. Blade just melts away as she does](#spoiler)
- Diana: Woah! (OK, like I said, three weeks ago, my memory sucks. I'm going to do my best to paraphrase. It's going to be awful. This is really *bad* idea.)
- Ares: LOL!
- Diana: But that's the Godkiller dude!
- Ares: LOL, you think that puny sword can kill me? [I'm a god. Only a god can kill a god!](#spoiler)
- Diana: Let me get this handy lasso I have that will make you tell the truth and tie you up with it. Hold still. Thanks! OK, now what's the deal with the sword?
- Ares: [You are the Godkiller Diana, and](#spoiler) look, these humans suck, they're always warring and stuff, I don't even need to encourage them, I just whisper 'Mustard gas' into someone's ear and poof! They're killing people! Look, given [we're both gods, you should join me](#spoiler) because they're not worth it.

Wish the script were online. But in any case, does that ring a bell? Ares' argument that she should join him and the comment about the only thing that can defeat him doesn't make much sense otherwise.

",6erigc
dji817r,"> Please refrain from playing the ""in the comics"" card. The movie should be able to stand on its own two legs without asking the audience to know what was said in issue #24, page 4, panel 6.

Whatever. It does. I'm by no means a WW comic expert, but this seemed fairly obvious, and moreover it's fairly obvious why an island full of adult women and zero men cut off from society for millennia (all of this is explicitly stated in the movie) would not have children. Diana herself is the oddity, and this is explained initially by handwaving from Hippolyta, and then later explicitly by Ares,

Look, I don't wish to sound antagonistic, but is it possible that many of your problems with the movie aren't that certain things aren't explained, but that you just didn't - for whatever reason, a lack of interest, maybe a complex plot, I've no idea - understand it? In another post which you've responded to, I reminded you of Ares pretty explicit explanation of how Diana came to be. You don't remember that, even after prodding, which makes me wonder if you were following along.

There's no shame in it. I've watched many movies before and missed stuff that pretty much everyone else ""got"", and I fully understand (and sympathize!) and can understand you not liking the movie as a result.

But all of this *was* in the movie. Diana being the sole child is more or less obvious and at times the reasons are almost hammered in. Remember that ""Men are only necessary for procreation"" line? You think it was just a joke at Steve Trevor's expense?

> Sorry, but I didn't feel that was good enough. He still came out of nowhere and tossed out some loose rationale for why he hadn't stomped her like a bug when they first met.

That wasn't the point I was addressing. You said you would have liked to see Ares playing both sides. I was responding to that.

But to answer this point: the reason he didn't squash her like a bug is actually, again, explained in the movie, directly, oddly enough at the same time as Diana's actual origin is revealed. Is it possible you went to the bathroom during this scene? Because in some ways that scene marks the point at which the movie goes downhill, a massive ""Tell, don't bother to show"" monologue followed by a pointless fight between two equals that doesn't feel like it's going to be resolved and thus has no tension.

> As much as I want to believe you, does Ares CONFIRM that Diana was born like any other child? Because I honestly do not remember. 

[I've forgotten the exact words used, but yes, Ares confirms specifically that Diana was the result of sex between Zeus and Hippolyta.](#spoiler)

* She read about all of those things, but she's never practiced them. Plus, she's a warrior princess. In her eyes, she's on the level of leaders. She stood up to her own mom/queen to be there in the first place. Why would she kowtow to a bunch of humans?

* The Amazon backstory says they were originally gifts to mankind to teach them love so they wouldn't be so savage. It didn't work, so the Amazons escaped and went to live on their own island. Given their original purpose, it's not that hard to see why WW falls in love so easily.

Hoping this doesnt mean DC will move away from making sterner toned movies or at least maybe they will cater the tone of the movie to the character.

Hippolyta however has disavowed any ""boning with Zeus"" when she made up that story about making Diana out of clay first and THEN Zeus bringing the clay alive.   Hippolyta is the mother of Diana only in the sense of having raised her.

Going beyond the movie, my version of what happened better parallels actual Greek myth:  Zeus made Diana entirely on his own just as Athena supposedly spontaneously sprang from Zeus' forehead one day.  Zeus just gave away Diana to Hippolyta to raise making Hippolyta merely the foster mother.   Diana is entirely equal in status to Ares as a god, and maybe better as Diana is all Zeus' making with no part from a mother.
",6erigc
dina4hw,Diana was pretty gullible and believed everything she was told. As to why Hyppolita would lie to her I guess was to protect her from taking off from Themyscira even sooner. Towards the end of the film Ares pretty much tells Diana that she is his sister and Zeus' daughter with the Queen of the Amazons. In the comic books this was a relatively recent retcon from 2011. Before that there was a version where Diana was the daughter of Ares. And before that that she was made of clay. But to me the Zeus one makes more sense since she always seemed pretty overpowered to be just an amazon. Zeus being the most powerful of the greek gods makes more sense as to why she is almost as strong as superman. She's pretty much like Hercules.,6erigc

I disagree. It wasn't really an ""it's your destiny"" type of thing. There was no prophecy or anything and the ladies of Themyscira actually sought to keep Diana on island and not become what she was designed for. Hence the Queen not wanting her to train and not telling her what she really was. True to her character, Diana does what she wants and goes against the wishes of her mother and leaves the island. She didn't leave because ""it was her destiny"", she left because she wanted to. Everything she did was because she wanted to do it, no because she had to.

WW did have a simple plot: WW leaves Themiscira to pursue - on a hunch - Ares.  It's the fluff that I slam.  She tells Trevor ""Our sacred duty is to protect the world.""  Meanwhile, Themyscira isolates itself from the world and doesn't realize there's a world war.

I am no fan of BvS and MoS, but BvS got a 27% on RT.  For the special effects alone, only 1 in 4 critics felt it was worthwhile.  I did not like BvS (mostly because of Jesse Eisenberg), but I still thought it was worthwhile.  Aside from Jeese's antics, it was certainly watchable.  I honestly would have a hard time watching WW again.  I've already cited some of the cringy dialogue as well as laughable 1990s TV special effects.  It looked like a TV pilot.  The only positive is that the movie didn't harp on feminist themes of evil men and female superiority.

Her story of being eager to join the war due to childhood myths of battle and glory, then her becoming disillusioned (in this case for over a century) was incredibly potent since it was story of many soldiers who went off to war.
I never stated killing Germans was good. If her first encounter had been with a different soldier from a different country the side she fought on would of been different but her motivation to end war and then her disillusionment then re-engagement with humanity would of been the same.

World War One was as Steve called it, ""a great big mess"". The film even went out of its way to show both leadership's desperately wanting peace to counter the ""evil German trope"".

At the same time, you could establish Ares in dream/nightmare sequences where he tries to get Diana to join him throughout the film. This adds some more inner conflict with Diana throughout the story, introduces the idea of Ares wanting Diana to join him and also gives Ares a looming ""Emperor Palpatine"" presence to build anticipation for his first real appearance.

dii6cii,"Found Guardians of the Galaxy 2 boring and predictable. Villain was obvious and there were too many characters to really flesh out. 

The point of Wonder Woman was specifically *not* to develop those supporting characters because they are just one-off supporting characters. While the main lead didn't have character development, because honestly he didn't change, the point of the movie was that this was Wonder Woman's story. It's a flashback from her point of view so from her memories, the only one that's really important to see meaningful change is her. You get to see her gradually enter the world and make the changes to her character. Changes that are actually reasonable as opposed to massive shifts.

Guardians of the Galaxy was trying to share the spotlight and add humor, but it left you with just snippets of each character where really only Peter minimal development. Felt more like someone telling their friend a summary of a movie as opposed to an actual movie. 

Even Rocket's little side arc didn't feel genuine because we just saw his tender side at the end of the first movie with him and Groot. Seeing him suddenly do a 180 and then another 180 made him just feel mentally unbalanced which is fine for the character, but really not something that required an entire side story to accomplish.

The sacrificial death felt meaningless since most of that character's scenes were played with jokes. Didn't get any kind of emotional twinge when he died. It was more just a feeling of ""Ok. That's nice."" since they tacked it together. If they had actually chosen to focus a bit more on him instead of building on Rocket's random changes of heart they could have easily made him more interesting.

TLDR; By trying to add a little bit to everyone in Guardians of the Galaxy v2. Very little gets accomplished. With Wonder Woman, the only character that mattered got the spotlight and had a reasonable slow development and progression that mattered.",6erigc

I mean, love SHOULD overcome hate, right? We should strive to be better, that seems to be the key part of it, not that love is some all conquering supernatural force, but that it is a part of humanity as much as war and is the best part of us.

I wanted to see her duel with Ares with swords at speeds regular humans wouldn't be able to comprehend. I wanted them to hit each other so hard they land a mile away from each other. We know that Ares can fly and I think from the final scene in the movie Diana can fly too. It would have been nice to see her fly for the actual fight too and maybe battle Ares in the sky?

I'm sort of just spitballing here but you get my point...

One of my favourite moments in BvS was the contrast between Superman and WW in how they fought with Doomsday. Superman is not a trained fighter so relies on brute force and momentum and as a consequence gets flung around by Doomsday a lot. But Doomsday can't land a single hit on Wonder Woman who manages to dodge and block his every attack then cut his ankle so he falls (even though she is weaker than both of them). Really shows you that it's not her first time fighting crazy monsters.

difozdw,"IMO, a better way to end the movie would be:

1. Wonder Woman fights and kills the German General Ludendorff, believing that he is Ares, (i.e., the same as in the movie.) 

2. She becomes confused and puzzled when the fighting continues and does not stop just because the ""supervillain"" is dead, (i.e., same as the movie.) 

3. Steve Trevor explains to her that killing one man or supervillain does not stop the war - or end all the evil in the world, that evil is within men, and that it is men who create the evi and the killing and evil - in the world. (same as the movie.) 

4. Wonder Woman becomes angry and upset at Steve and mankind.  Steve has to leave quickly to stop the chemical weapon.  Steve says something else to Wonder Woman before he kisses her and leaves, but she is deafened by an explosion and can't hear what he says. (same) 

5. Wonder Woman is then attacked by overwhelming German forces, NOT Ares who suddenly appears out of nowhere to taunt her, (i.e., here it is *different* from the movie.) 

6. Wonder Woman is tied down by the overwhelming German forces, and witnessed Steve Trevor and his men's sacrifices to save the world.  Steve's dead sends her into a berserker's rage.  In her god mode, she recovers what Steve has said to her before their final kiss and goodbye: that men, though evil, can also be good and noble as well; that men are willing to make the ultimate and noble sacrifice for the greater good and to save lives of others. Wonder Woman defeats the overwhelming German forces (not Ares) in her rage, (i.e., slightly different from the movie.) 

7. She wins the battle, mourns for Steve's dead when the war ends, and finally realizes and accepts the duality nature of men. She decides to dedicate her life to guiding men to overcome their evil nature with their good nature, (i.e., mostly same but slightly different; but here she would have a more  metaphysical  and philosophical purpose.) 

IMO, that would have made a deeper, more meaningful movie.  Without Areas, that would make Wonder Woman into the first superhero origin movie without a supervillain.  It would make Wonder Woman transcend the typical superhero movie.  (FYI: Logan also does not have an overarching supervillain.) 

Seriously the whole Ares battle at the end is just *dumb*.

The British army executed hundreds of its own men, most of whom were suffering from conditions like PTSD.  Both sides used chemical warfare.  Both sides exhausted their nations by sending men simply to go and die.  If the Germans were corrupted, so were the British, and if the British were corrupted as well, why we were consistently on the side of the British?

dj6y0om,"Please, bear with me as I unload my initial thoughts and feelings about this film now that I know there are people out there with reasonable, measured responses to this film. 

I saw the movie yesterday. I didn't even mean to, but my plans for the day fell through and I had an afternoon to spare. I meant to wait a little longer for the hype to die down, for people to stop treating the movie as some sort of crown jewel in comparison to the past DCEU films, and to start judging the movie based on is own merits. My expectations weren't high. I felt fairly certain that a lot of the hype surrounding the film was the fact that the movie contained a female protagonist, was female directed, and by the DCEU's standards over the past four years, didn't make people want to fling themselves off the face of the Earth. 

The movie had its good moments, when I don't consider plot holes, I thought the movie worked fairly well on its own, and I think it did a number of things better than MoS, BvS, or Suicide Squad, but I don't think it's the majestic piece of work so many viewers have made it out to be. I honestly found myself getting bored, I found the plot points to be rote, and by the end, I just felt so incredibly meh about most of what I had seen. The positives I can identify with the movie barely outweigh the issues I have with it. I am not easily swayed by action scenes and eye candy. I am *first and foremost* interested in getting compelling characters and story, and I just didn't get much of that. Maybe when I read/listen to a few reviews, my mind will change, but until then, I remain underwhelmed.

Ares was the big bad ""evil"" but he didn't start the wars, fire the bombs, he merely gave humans the tools to do so. He showed Diana his point of view on Zeus' humanity, but ultimately she learned to love with Steve - and intimacy was something she hadn't known before. Yes, it is cheesy, that love wins the day, but it was her discovering her own philosophy when so many others (her mom, Steve, ares) had been throwing theirs ideals at her.  I think the movie needed people to drive these concepts, not just an evil desposable German general luddendorf.

They did a great job developing Diana and even Steve. They had great chemistry which is actually pretty rare onscreen. Man of Steel felt different which is why I liked it so much.

However given what we learn at the start its far more likely he was simply banished out of his earthly form or something like that since Zeus's blast didnt kill him either, all she needed to do was break his control or whatever he had over the germans, I wouldnt be surprised to see him return in some form or another.

",6erigc
dinjn58,">A lesson has to be learned and she did eventually learn hers.

I didn't downvote btw. Not fair to disagree with an interpretation. Anyhoo, I think it's important to note that the lesson she ""learns"" isn't something she's totally ok with. You can't save everyone...whereas Clark might've considered hanging up the cape in BvS, Diana doesn't even briefly consider that. She is wholly committed to saving everyone she can. When Clark goes on his soul-searching voyages in the mountains, WW is busy saving peoples' lives (not shitting on Superman here, he's my favorite). Yet, I don't blame Clark at all. 

In fact *most* people would do this if they had such powers. However, WW is purely confident and optimistic and will never take no for an answer. Her ideals of hope define her. She vaguely shares a similar trait with Affleck's Batman (perhaps this is why they are working together well assembling the team, so it seems, in the JL trailer) -- who, although not purposely -- teaches Superman a lesson about being a hero...if you remember he says something during the battle to the extent of ""the world only makes sense if you force it to."" This ultimately an ideal the Justice League will collectively grasp. It's actually quite brilliant and a necessary, albeit hard look at evil in the world and how you deal with it. This is why I believe the ""sad/emo"" (though I think this is excessive phrasing) Superman in MoS and BvS is actually very well done -- I'm certain, in time, he will emerge as the confident leader he's supposed to be. 

>She saw the world as Black and White because of the Amazons telling her that it's Good vs Evil, but the world is Grey.

Again, I think WW rejects this idea of the world being grey. Her faith in her upbringing and more-or-less her existence as a prophetic figure make her certain that Good will triumph over Evil. Hence, she metaphorically wants to end war in the film, and she *literally* kills The God Of War. Very telling of her defining characteristics. What she sets out to do, she will do. In the name of good. Her, Superman, and Batman are almost a three-way foil. They balance out perfectly. All invested in the pursuit of good, in very different ways. 

Batman has lost his faith (hence the killing; i.e. until Superman died saving him, allowing him to reconsider his values -- very biblical here) uses a simple, mathematical approach to being a hero (less criminals = less evil in the world). He is very, very human.

Superman wants to have faith -- and as regular farm boy Clark Kent, he probably would have; however, because he essentially has to become a prophetic hero (c'mon, Synder essentially made him Christ do I have to say it at this point? Rewatch when he's ""taken down from the cross"" after the Doomsday battle) he has much difficulty maintaining that faith. But his friends will soon help! He has immense power, virtually eternal life, but it all is meaningless without humanity. He'll save them, but they also save him in a way by giving him purpose. Very Christ-like, again. 

Thirdly, WW is of the greatest faith in good and humanity. She is a beacon of hope and faith. Of course, she virtually is a God, much like Superman -- only she wears this proudly and is very confident in that aspect of her life due to her upbringing and how starkly different it was than Clark's. He was always a fish out of water, she was born being told how great she would be and witnessing others like her. In either case, no matter how many horrors befall her, she will keep on fighting for good. 

In any case, they represent the ""Trinity"" for more reasons than just being a three-some of characters. It's a really underrated and amazing theme to carry the films and pretty much the brainchild of Snyder to really highlight those themes through some amazing cinematic images in MoS and BvS and now Patty Jenkins with WW. Sometimes, people don't go to superhero films to think...they want to be entertained. 

I understand why these films have been divisive up to this point. WW represents purely admirable traits throughout her entire film. Both Batman and Superman can be unlikable at points -- I think this enhances the narrative immensely, but a lot of people don't like their heroes to be weak. 

Goodness gracious. That was a mouthful.

There's been several Batman, Superman, Spider-man, and other superhero origins movies already.  They barely touched on WW's background in the movie.  She left the island after 30 minutes into the movie, and that was it.  She's on her mission (and vacation tour of man's world) for the rest of the movie.

I also found the film very predictable but I also really enjoyed it. For me, predictable isn't necessarily a bad thing as long as you enjoy the journey. Some of my favourite movies of all time are painfully predictable but it doesn't matter because you enjoy the characters and the setting enough that you actually WANT to go where the film is leading you. 

That's why Wonder Woman is a film that lives and dies on whether you emotionally connect with Wonder Woman, Steve Trevor and the supporting cast. If you don't, then everything falls flat because you can see everything coming a mile away. If you do, then it's great because you're happy to go on a journey with these characters even if you know the destination and all the pit stops.

I can't speak for everyone who liked the movie (and I haven't actually read many reviews so I'm unsure if this is the consensus) but I was drawn in by the chemistry between Diana and Steve Trevor and ended up being really invested in their growing relationship which had this old school screwball comedy charm to it. 

I also really enjoyed the performance of Gal Gadot in particular as she pulled off the innocence and adventurous nature of the character really well. I appreciated that they didn't make her a generic man-hating warrior woman but instead a likeable, relatable and well meaning but flawed character.

The post is getting a bit lengthy so I can't go into everything I enjoyed but to sum up, I liked the characters, their chemistry and also really enjoyed the cinematography and music which made the fact that it was predictable not an issue.

Innocents dying despite doing everything right, post traumatic stress, and the war wasn't just a backdrop for the good guys to fight the bad guys.

Introduction
Oh wow look at cool powers
The enemy is revealed
Possible plot twist
The hero is down and all looks lost
Possible plot twist
The hero finds some sort of inner strength and saves the day

That's pretty much EVERY super hero movie.  There are a few exceptions and when I find them I adore them (V for Vendetta for example).  And some super hero movies are by the numbers but they just have elements that make them absolutely standout that I can tolerate the same-ness (Dark Knight Rises for example).

But I'd love for a super hero movie to do something different.  Maybe they just quash the villains for once.  Maybe instead of having some sort of epiphany mid fight they just do something different.  Or they planned ahead to have a sniper buddy shoot the bad guy in the face when things looked dark.  

Variety is good, be creative in the story not every story must be like this.

You know its kind of crazy though and I'm NOT trying to make this a DC vs Marvel thing but every time Marvel movies get high ratings there were all these ridiculous claims Disney 'paid off' the critics and talked about it as if its some real thing. Now we have WW, a run away critical hit and a good film IMO but where those claims??? And I'm not saying people SHOULD say that, I'm saying there does sound like this film is getting way more praise critically than the audience is saying it. Most people seem to agree its definitely a good film, just not the amazing, sorry, wonder that is being hyped to be. And to be fair critics aren't necessarily saying that either, most simply liked it but this is what happens when a movie gets such a high score. 

I really liked the film, no its not the best film made ever, but I do agree its the best DCEU film made. Again that doesn't make it a good film in its own right and when you're just talking a few amount of films in a narrow genre even less so but WW was a film that did something different than those others and just made it a fun superhero film but also with some serious and thoughtful moments.

And I think WW herself was just interesting to watch because she really was a fish out of water. They played it up for comedy bits but she really had a hard time understanding why people did the things they did. She was even the opposite of Superman who thinks humans are inherently good and should be defended as such. She really did question if they deserved to exist but also believed they should be saved. It was an interesting take we haven't seen in a comic book movie (or show) in a long time and maybe that is another reason its getting high praise.

digpcks,"I kind of liked the slo-mo at the beginning when you see all the warriors training and they do some cool shit, and it didn't *really* bother me in the fight scenes (I'm mostly thinking of the village after the No Man's Land thing) but it does feel like they need to come up with other ways to make their fights compelling.

There were a lot of reasons I thought the final fight fell flat, and one of them is that, to me, the ""magical"" enemies and characters are never as cool as the more human ones. You end up with fights where the characters just throw progressively larger balls of CGI at each other until the hero learns their true power *was inside them all along* and then they throw the biggest CGI ball yet and the villain dies or evaporates or whatever.

I feel like Ares could have not been in the movie at all and it would have been just fine; they could have had a more ""realistic"" final conflict. He's basically just a war profiteer with magic powers that don't matter until we need a big showy finish. It also would have fit with what the movie hints at a lot, which is people's skepticism about Diana's assertion that there's a god of war involved named Ares and killing him will make everything great again. People just kinda go ""uh huh, sure"" because it keeps her happy and they need her to keep doing whatever it is she is because it's useful for *other* reasons. And it seems like maybe it's going that direction, because she kills the guy with the evil name and people are still fighting, whoa! Maybe she was wrong! 30 seconds later PSYCHE just kidding hey Diana my name is Ares you were right I am real! 30 seconds later DOUBLE PSYCHE you were wrong I don't actually do *that* much.

I mean, really, Ares plays basically no role in the movie except for existing just for the final fight to have an excuse to happen.

There are other things that bug me a bit too; during the No Man's Land scene she's standing up there tanking all the machine gun fire with her shield... but she's mostly just holding it in front of her head and upper torso. Probably 40% of her body is exposed. It looked very poster-y but it didn't work as a fight scene because it didn't make any sense.

Maybe it's unfair to compare it to The Winter Soldier because it could focus on things other than origins but [in the famous highway scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXPOl6EjbWg&t=1m42s), look at how Cap uses his shield there! That's awesome! And it makes sense! He's as small as he can be behind it.

I haven't seen The First Avenger recently so maybe they do the same kind of stuff and it's unfair to criticize Wonder Woman for not being more different when it's really just trying to be a proof of concept that people will see a Wonder Woman movie, and that it can be pretty good. It all still felt very Snyder-y, which I think is a bad thing, and I hope that maybe for WW2 they give them a bit more creative license to break away from the style problems that so many people feel have plagued the DCCU. That and they won't be shackled by having to tell the origin story, though this one I think is definitely more needed than, like, a Batman or a Spider-man origin movie which have been done to death.

They're not what I turn to for groundbreaking, unique action sequences anymore. And so maybe the fact that I wasn't really expecting that portion to be all that great is why I enjoyed it so much.

Because for me, it was all the rest of the movie that made it good. It was far better than the average superhero movie in terms of characterization, and it had several really satisfying ""promise of the premise"" scenes (i.e. the chunk in the middle of the movie that isn't necessarily about advancing the main plot so much as it is about delivering on the core idea, in this case an Amazon princess being introduced to the world for the first time).

With GoT budget are you referring to the 'Battle of the Bastards' episode? If so, then yes I do agree GoT (BEST TV EPISODE EVER) has a much much better fight sequence than WW but let's put somethings in perspective
- WW's point is not just the fights sequences but the story of Diana's growth into WW, so parts of it will be lackluster when compared to GoT's Battle of the Bastards where one whole episode is 80% action
- WW total budget includes proprietary licenses from DC, cuts from WB, marketing, production, and not to mention contract payments for big name stars like Gal and Chris Pine (compared to lesser known but arguably better GoT actors)

I don't think you're wrong, I just feel like you might be missing out on all the good stuff because of some bad stuff

dicxci4,"The direction may be better, but it is also much less ambitious. This was a simple origin story that entertains superficially. Its well directed and has likeable characters, but does nothing we haven't seen before. Snyder, on the other hand, is always aiming to give us something we've never seen or even thought about (to varying degrees of success). By deconstructing these mythical figures, whose goodness and heroics are often taken for granted, he gives a fresh (albeit uncomfortable) take on these heroes - would Superman really be loved in today's world? Would Batman really be able to deal with the emotional traumas he's sustained? His films are also steeped in metaphor and symbolism - both visual and literary, which tends to muddle the narrative but also gives a real sense that Snyder is very passionate about these characters and respects them as more than mere fun or entertainment. I understand that that's not why a lot of people watch superhero movies, but I for one love that at least one filmmaker is willing to use these movies to explore themes seriously, just like the good comicbooks do.

Marvel can take a story style and wrap it up in a superhero theme, but DC... is kind of just telling it straight, but to me is worse off in a way with Wonder Woman, because *this one* felt confused. 

It *could* have been just a war story, and there's an added point of World War 1- where there were no Nazis and the world was just a mess. Trevor's message of 'it's a mess and people can be good or bad' could've totally been hammered in well- but then it turned back into an implied good vs evil thing.

 I'll start with the actual villain and see if I can get passed that one element of the movie before I lose interest in this topic altogether.

Killian might be the woeat villain in all of the Marvel movies which aren't exactly known for their great villains.  His powers are ill-defined.  He creates bomb men, but he has similar powers, but he can't stop them from exploding but he never does.  And these powers can completely demolish Iron Man suits Mach-doesn't matter despite them holding up to Thor's hammer a movie or so ago.  He can also use...heat, I guess?  to open the Iron Man suits?  

His motivation, unless I missed something,  for creating an entire terrorist organization and bombing hundreds is for money.  Money that I guess he could never make legitimately doing the things that he is already doing.  I guess you don't need money to supply an army and attack helicopters and a castle or whatever.

He blows up Tony Starks house in broad daylight on TV (let's forget that Stark invited him to do so and then put up no effort to defend his house) with no ramifications from the military or SHIELD or the Avengers.  Why couldn't the military scramble a couple of jets to take down these helicopters?  Because don't stop to ask questions, that's why.  Who you would think would at least be involved enough to go to Stark's funeral since he is presumed dead at this point.  But I'm sure that will be explained in another movie.  Nope.  

Then, after killing Stark, he shows up by going all MacGuyver on his compound where we get to see him as more than just the armor, but really we just want to see him cracking jokes without a mask on.  We learn that Killian has just been luring Stark in so that he can fix his formula (because Stark is really good at biology I guess?) despite trying to kill him throughout the movie.

And then we get the big ending where Pepper Potts is given powers for no reason and can do a backflip jump attack to look all badass.

[Background of the Frontier](https://www.titanfall.com/en_au/titanfall/the-frontier).

**In bullet points, it went something like this:**

- The chronology is shifty, but it looks like a company called Hammond Engineering started out in the natural resources extraction business sometime in the late-20th century. 

- By the early-22nd century, it had become a sprawling space-based industrial empire called the Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation. They funded and oversaw the colonisation of the Frontier, a volume of planets that were both close together and at varying degrees of habitability.

- However, interest in the Frontier colonisation efforts began to wane, possibly connected to the emergence of armed conflict (perhaps the legendary 'Titan Wars'?) and heavy industry competition back in the Core Systems around Earth. The IMC pulled out of the Frontier, and the colonists there flourished alone.

- A few decades later, seemingly at the border between the mid- and late-22nd century, the IMC returned. They claimed ownership over the vast territory of the Frontier, and began evicting the children of the earlier colonists from resource-rich land. It is implied that there was something of a resource crisis occurring in the Core Systems at the time.

- Tensions between the colonists and the IMC boiled into armed conflict, and the a territorial defense pact was formed between people of all walks of life - farmers, traders, mercenaries, veterans, and pirates - that gave birth to the Frontier Militia. While the fleets took on the technologically-superior IMC space force, the brigades fought with blood, sweat and tears to hold planetside territory, each brigade tied to a specific stretch of Frontier space.

- The war raged on.

It was a common (and very new) injury that resulted from the rapid increase in deadliness and firepower of the weaponry, combined with the nature of trench warfare, in which soldiers often thought they could pop their heads up and get a few shots off before anyone could retaliate. (Unfortunately, they often thought wrong).

It could be from toxins, though! But the wound we saw towards the end and the real-life counterpart the mask is referencing historically indicated to me that it was a wound from the front. Either way, as a med history nerd I was both excited by and fascinated with the inclusion of a facial prosthesis, as they were a huge advancement in both medical tools and consideration for the psychological state of a soldier after a deeply traumatic (and theretofore unseen) type of disfiguration that were incredibly specific to WWI.

The fact that Ares didn't force war on humans, only gave weapons to them as an option, just makes it more clear to her that she doesn't HAVE to kill in her fight for peace.

This is a problem that has appeared in all the DC movies thus far.  The universe is new enough that characters are still learning why they shouldn't kill, but the movie leading up to that revelation shows them killing so fans freak out about it, because until now they were leaving the message ambiguous for the next movie (Zodd being Superman's turning point, Luthor being Batman's turning point), while this one is a more natural build from Diana's early naivete to a more modern view with the third-act reveals (which was clearly built upon in her life during the ~90 years we don't see).",6erigc

Meanwhile, Germany in World War Two had a systematic campaign of genocide that was very deliberately aimed at wiping out entire populations (The ""Rape of Belgium"" was mostly an attempt to suppress Belgian partisans, but innocent civilians were often killed by mistake, or sometimes on purpose to demoralize the Belgian resistance) that resulted in the worst mass-slaughter of human beings in all of history.

I don't usually see movies in theaters more than once but the actions scenes alone were so long and packed I feel like it'll be fun to be able to focus on them more with a repeat viewing.

I'm really eager to see how well this film winds up doing because between this and Hunger Games, we'll hopefully be seeing more and more great female action protagonists. I wish we had more around when I was growing up but better late than never. 

Now if we can get more representation across the board that'd be great too. I'm really stoked for Jason Momoa's Aquaman (especially since my mom always gushed about her childhood crush on Aquaman so him being a hunk instead of the butt end of a joke is great) and Black Panther seems like it's going to be amazing. Chadwick Boseman straight up oozed charisma with the screentime he's had so far. I've never gotten much into superhero comics, instead opting for more linear storylines since all the crossovers and reboots confused the hell out of me, but now I'm probably going to look into finding out more so I could get stoked about their possible future inclusion.

Yes you did.

>You know how you can compare scantily clad? Look at what the men wear. 

The men in DCEU are all westerners or influenced by Western culture.

Superman is born in Krypton and bought up in America. In Krypton also, both men and [women covered there body from neck to toe.](https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&ved=0ahUKEwiapbTcie3UAhUCYo8KHUSKBD4QjBwIBA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fs-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com%2Foriginals%2Fe6%2F61%2F37%2Fe66137d6be45926f2bd817d120b7c630.jpg&psig=AFQjCNEgxFJ80tBU8KDIVpI7gA6v51XT9g&ust=1499170024034835).

[A female Kryptonian warrior](https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&ved=0ahUKEwi5-OW5iu3UAhUIM48KHfVJA0wQjBwIBA&url=http%3A%2F%2Flatimesherocomplex.files.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F06%2Fmanofsteel381.jpg&psig=AFQjCNH4qSq0Df9inYFqLgOA7R_-XQsucA&ust=1499170223883098)

Batman and Flash both are western people and both need full body armors, especially Batman.

Aquaman is also covered from neck to toe. But, so, are women of Atlantis.

Take a look at his wife, [Queen Mera](https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8RGJ_J9GNSbP8Yr7zw9OlA--/aD05MDU7dz0xNTgxO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2016-10-12/7a673700-90af-11e6-9eda-3b949691b88d_Mera-CROP.jpg), she is also covered from neck to toe.

The dress codes differ from culture to culture.


>I'm all about freedom of the body- but I'm not the rest of society nor the history of society. 

Umm..what the fuck are you talking about?

> I'm sorry to say. It makes them appeasing to the eye for the primary comic genre fan: the guy. I mean, Jesus- feminists love when the media has women that look real. I can't think of anything farther from that then the perfect Gal Gadot.

First, Gal Gadot IS A REAL WOMAN. And she is not one of a kind, a lot of women (physically) like her exists, throughout the glob. Just because she is extremely attractive, rich, hot etc doesn't mean she becomes unreal.

but I guess you are right, now, we need to have obese or anorexic, black/latino, short dyed haired female superhero now. And they especially need to have armpit hairs and nose rings.



>And while you say the Amazons aren't western people- they're also a fictional people created by a western man from a even more heavily dominated male society than it is now. 

Yes, Wonder Women is created by western men, but Amazons aren't created by western men. 

Take a look at [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Amazone_Staatliche_Antikensammlungen_8953.jpg). A helmeted Amazon with her sword and a shield bearing the Gorgon head image, Tondo of an Attic red-figure kylix, 510–500 BC. 

>Think about shit before you start throwing out accusations.

And I am still going to say the same thing. If you can only see how sexy and scantily clad Amazons are and totally ignore all other attributes about them, then yeah, you are a sexist person.

Being beautiful and being powerful does not need to be mutually exclusive.



So, no, western men didn't change or invent Amazon and their dress codes to only sexualize them and please their male viewers.

>WW saved a lot of lives. She's the super hero and main character. **But those are throwaway acts of heroism**, especially when everyone of the good guys saved some lives. WW isn't a portrayal of a strong woman anymore than Superman is of men. They're fake mythical figures. 

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
>The perceived cost is nil because they're super human and the threat is human. 

In both , Man of Steel and Wonder Woman, the main threat is not a human. I don't know what film you were watching this whole time.

> She's the super hero and main character.

No shit. Wonder Woman is a DC superhero film.


>They're fake mythical figures

Superman is not a mythical figure and when you went to see the film, did you know that it was a superhero film?As in, it is about people with superpower THAT DO NOT EXIST IRL?

>The desire for a female hero and the marketing saying she is has blinded you from the fact that she's not. 

Are you trying to Jedi mind trick me?

>She's mythical. Shit, that crappy Catwoman movie had more applicable heroism for women than this movie did.

**ಠ_ಠ** THE FUCK?

>You want a female super hero? 

Yes. Definitely Yes. I am eagerly waiting for Jessica Jones season 2, Ms. Marvel, and a Black Widow prequel.

> Use one made by a woman who actually understands women and the struggle against a patriarchal society. If you have to make one up- by all means do it.

Well, I appreciate your thought process. But that is not good enough.

We need a female superhero made by a woman,drawn by a woman, published by a company owned by woman.

Then we need the film directed by a woman, who understands women, story written by women, screenplay written by women, produced by women, promoted by women, starring all female characters, make ups (if any) done by women, distributed by women, played in theaters only owned by women, screened only for women, Bluray and DVD covers made by women, DVD commentary made by women, CGI given by women, soundtrack by women, sound mixing by women, video editing by women, cinematography by women, editing done by women, costumes designed by women etc.

And the villain need to be a man-shaped entity with a white color aura , named Patriarch, the GOD OF OPPRESSION.

djkzpo1,"Saying that you want to ""judge it on it's own merits"" is completely removing the film from its context, and paints you as an impartial judge of movie quality. No one is impartial, and no film is without social context. 

The social context and the subtle differences in this film are what truly make it great. Things like the lack of male gaze? *That* was revolutionary for a superhero film. There was no male gaze. For once I got to see a woman radiating power with slow mo shots of her *muscles*, her *arms* and not one gratuitous boob or butt shot.

For people who loved this film, things like Ares were a footnote. Having a campy villain is what made this on par with what a classic super hero film is. Diana didn't need a perfect villain. She needed a stage, and she got one. She needed to be treated the same way as every other beloved super hero regardless of gender, and she was.

It's not that Wonder Woman is lowering the bar for female super heroes, it's that the bar was so painfully low already that it took what may seem like a bare minimum of effort to surpass it and raise that bar.

dji04sa,"> I don't see any hint that there's an intent for her to take over from Hippolyta, indeed in an environment in which everyone is more or less immune from aging (but apparently not completely immortal) the concept seems unlikely.

Yes, I'll be happy to admit that the movie doesn't spell it out and that the Amazons are at the very least blessed with long lives. However, I believe that they are not immortal. The general got shot and killed, as did random Amazon #4 who swung down on the beach.

So, should the Queen however unlikely die for whatever damn reason, I find it reasonable to believe that the Princess will inherit the throne. Because at least that's how monarchies works, both in the real world and in many fictional ones. If/when new information is presented to us on just how Paradise Island is governed, we can resume this discussion. Until then, it's largely speculation.

> the scene progresses something along these lines:

Quite right as I recall it as well, but what we seem to disagree on is what is the Godslayer entails. Ares does NOT confirm that Diana's mother birthed her like any other child. He did not challenge the idea that Diana was sculpted from clay and granted life from Zeus. He merely confirms that the sword is but a toy and that the true Godslayer is Diana.

You say Godslayer is a God and has all the agency and free will that comes with it. 

I argue that Zeus had Diana created to be the Godslayer and as a result, Diana did not choose to help to end the war of her own free will. She's compelled to do so by destiny, by her purpose. A destiny that her mother tried to deny her, but in true Greek mythological fashion, no one can deny fate/destiny.",6erigc
dji9uxv,"We could go around and about this until our fingers bleed, so for simplicity sake, there were things in the movie that I felt were odd and could have been dealt with differently, with much more clarity. It's quite possible that it was right there in my face, it just escaped me for whatever reason.

Diana explains to Steve that her mother made her out of clay and Zeus gave her life, but we the audience already know this from the bedtime story told earlier. Why repeat it? It's possible that it was to foreshadow the idea that maybe, maybe Diana was made the ""good ol' fashion way"" after all. It still doesn't change the fact that I find it clumsy and confusing in its execution.

> You said you would have liked to see Ares playing both sides. I was responding to that.

I want a scene where it is shown that there's more to that British minister than meets the eye, that's he may not be a kind old man that is an ally of Steve and Diana. Having him bumbling around in the background in an office and chatting with Steve, helping him with vital intelligence, over the phone is not enough. Not for me at least.

Something like... I dunno, he takes that book Steve handed in and try to coax British scientist to develop their own horrible weapon. To use either as a deterrent in a zero sum game or as a preemptive strike. At least then his shift to being the true bad guy wouldn't be so jarring.

> Is it possible you went to the bathroom during this scene?

No toilet breaks, ever. But to be fair, there is a lot of new information that gets dumped in the audience lap in the last 10 or so minutes. And it happens at the same time as a massive CGI slugfest takes place. And Steve. And the gas. And the plane. And the indian guy. And random German soldiers. 

Again, I found it clumsy and confusing in its execution. Essential plot points should always be delivered with sufficient clearity that the audience can catch it, process it and move on. Unless of course you want your audencie to be confused and puzzled. ",6erigc
dk0nlx3,"> if they didn't show other kids, we would wonder where they were, or just assume they existed and weren't shown.

I'm pretty sure that a piece of dialogue states that Diana is the only child on the island. Clumsy exposition is clumsy. It wouldn't kill the movie if the warrior practice that young Diana spied on were teenagers rather than grown women. Or maybe they were teenagers, but I didn't realize it.

> She read about how humans reproduce. That doesn't mean she was reading about it because she thought it applied to Amazons. It was just one of the many things she learned.

Why though? There is no reason for her to learn that. Amazons are blessed with long lives, and they haven't interacted with the world of man for thousands of years. To me, it comes across as a clunky way to avoid the [Born Sexy Yesterday trope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thpEyEwi80).

> She read about all of those things, but she's never practiced them. Plus, she's a warrior princess. In her eyes, she's on the level of leaders. She stood up to her own mom/queen to be there in the first place. Why would she kowtow to a bunch of humans?

If she'd read one book about diplomacy, I'd argue that the first rule it hammers in is mutual respect. Even if she considers herself the British generals equal, she ought to know that showing her ideals down their throats until the choke on it will not earn her any favors. It is disrespectful. It'd be no different than Steve calling them crazy bitches for swinging swords around and insisting that they serve HIM a sandwich. Oddly enough, he didn't. He was baffled and confused over their isolation and ignorance regarding the war, but also patient in his explanation. Steve, a soldier/pilot/spy, had more tact, tone and skills of diplomacy than Diana.

> The Amazon backstory says they were originally gifts to mankind to teach them love so they wouldn't be so savage. It didn't work, so the Amazons escaped and went to live on their own island. Given their original purpose, it's not that hard to see why WW falls in love so easily. What kept the Amazons from fulfilling their role to bring love to mankind was that they simply moved away from mankind, not that they lost their capacity to love.

Oh, that's rich... a new breed of women created by the gods from the ground up to love man, because you know... normal women suddenly didn't cut it anymore, though it turns out that they couldn't fulfill their divine purpose and ran away. That's not problematic? Not at all? ",6erigc

digs63n,"The outsiders entering the island I'm referring to is when the Germans attacked Themyscira. We already saw that. What I'm saying is that I think more time could be spent on the aftermath of it, as it is a big inciting incident and really develops Wonder Woman's character and the story as a whole. I want to see more of Diana grieving the loss of her loved ones and life as she knew it. Again, the decision to leave behind her old world, with no promise of coming back, to fulfill a sense of duty that was instilled in her since she was young is kind of a big deal, but imo, the movie didn't make it seem like that.

If you just skimmed through my comment, I don't fault for you that since I wrote like a mini-essay, but I actually said that No Man's Land and Steve's sacrifice were examples of major plot points that got the screen time it deserved. I never said more time needed to be spent on those. What I thought should be explored more was Diana killing Ares and realizing what little it did because life is not as simple as one bad guy being responsible for all of the evil in the world. This is one of the biggest character development moments for Wonder Woman, and I felt like she needed to wrestle with it a bit more before her confrontation with Ares. 

Fleshing out major plot points does not necessarily have to make the movie longer. There was definitely some fluff in there that could be trimmed down a little, and again, excessive slow-mo shots. Just a disclaimer because I feel like it's going to come up. I'm not saying the movie has to be complete devoid of lighthearted or fluff moments, especially when they give us more insight on the characters. I'm just saying it is possible to give the pressing themes of the film the time they deserve to explore them while still being fun to watch and a reasonable time length. There are lots of movies that do that. 

Anyway, if you still don't agree, there's definitely nothing wrong with that, but I felt like you and I weren't on the same page on some of the points I was making earlier so I just wanted to clarify.",6erigc
dj4yd10,"That's interesting. I saw it as more of disdain for his interest in sex as opposed to war and power. But maybe it's up for interpretation.  As for Ludendorff, I saw her more as admiring his power. That being said, your interpretation would make it easier to have the alternative ending I was proposing, but that's not really the point :)

>This is exactly why I didn't like the focus on love. It was not at all clear that they weren't referring to the sexual relationship between Trevor and Diana. 

To be fair, I wasn't opposed to them having a romantic relationship. That fits squarely in the Wonder Woman canon. I just kind of think it went completely against the ending they made and had little to no context. Explanation is one way of doing it, but I don't really think they could explain that away unless all that lightning was actually a hyper charged Carebear stare. 

>Yeah, I think we're actually pretty much of the same opinion. My meaning was that, were I to recommend it to someone, I wouldn't describe it as such.

I'd also recommend people see it. They handled the characters pretty well. I just get really bothered when a story contradicts itself, and that kind of robbed some of the other good stuff for me.

It doesn't have to rely on the actions of others, knowledge of the prophecy, etc. She doesn't have to even be consciously trying to fulfill it. It's just something that's supposed to happen. A prophecy can account for her independent mind, mistakes, etc. It's one of the reason I find them so gosh darn annoying. Just look at the story of Oedipus. He did everything in his power to not bring his prophecy to fruition, and it happened anyways.

When the German general first shows up at the refinery his lieutenant goes on about how his troops are starving and overworked before he's subsequently executed. Shortly after that the German commanders are murdered via gas while they are discussing the terms of the armistice, showing that they were also sick of the bloodshed.

Ares reveals to Diana that all he did was give mankind the tools they needed to finally exterminate each other. He explains that man has always had a natural inking for violence and he merely provided a means to an end. Ares himself wasn't threatening the world but his influence was accelerating the rate of global annihilation.

I believe they shied away from Diana being remorseful for every kill because it would have detracted from her badassery, but they did address the horrors of conflict through the other characters/scenes (Charlie's PTSD, the amputees coming off the boat, the soldiers/horses wounded on the trail to the front).

you mean just like every villain who shoots at cap, too?  come on, bro.  at least they showed bullets deflecting off wonder woman's shin guards, so they were aiming at her legs... nazi's don't even aim at cap's legs.  they aim right for his shield... which brings me to...

> Just that WW physics is not consistent and doesn't show realism. It's basically cartoon physics.

Neither did Civil War.

diqjmn7,"Yeah, but in the end this is Diana's first introduction to the outside world, first introduction to war, and she was (to a degree) blindly trusting a man that she identified with because of his admiral qualities. Why would she see it in any other way after the Germans killed her Amazon sisters, she was brought to No Man's Land where a village was being exploited, and they purposefully went where the worst Germans are (Dr Poison and what's his face).

If she had immediately been put into a situation where is was obvious that *both* sides were bad the whole movie falls apart. *Plus* you have to remember that she was very focused on finding Ares and Steve kind of implied that she'd find him at the front fighting for the Germans.

Personally, as an American, I never got the feeling that the Germans *were* the bad guys other than the two villians. And I think at the end Diana even recognized that Dr Poison was just a victim of circumstance.

I mean, it might seem like they painted the Germans in a bad light but they did have to paint *someone* as the bad guys otherwise the whole premise doesn't work. And given WWII it's a lot easier for people just to roll with the Germans being baddies other than the other way around.

About the chasing a british spy: This is what I mean: A german rowboat team would never chase a spy onto an island because we know and have evidence of how germans, and how humans at war, work and act.
the germans did not know this was a 'magical tropical paradise filled with bow-wielding amazons.'   The germans knew: 'chase spy. Was night and foggy, now day and tropical and huge bubble.'  
They don't know if it's magical or anything. They have protocol and guns on the ship and they have communications.  Think of sending in a rowboat fleet as the same as giving the order to take off pants and dance. It would not happen it's unrealistic. 
-We needed an amazon bow island fighting scene of some type. 
The way it was done was poor and unrealistic and forced.
German soldiers would not charge in like this was braveheart. 
Fire arrows do not work - they are a myth -they were not used.
Take the island scene back, re do it better, and no complaints. Give me tension. 
How about the germans explore the island a little and the amazonians pick them off and ambush. 
It also says something horrible about the amazon women: they are actually bad fighters because they blindly attack an enemy as no actual fighter would do.   How can I believe they train their whole life if their first move is to give up their massive defensive advantage and go down to the beach and MELEE gun attackers.  Every 2 seconds I had issues with this movie. I just wanted to see wonder woman stuff but instead we get super unrealistic no man's land scene where soldiers are acting weird.

dj70eqh,"I feel like a lot of people really wanted to like this movie, so they turned a blind eye to many of the poor (and lazy) writing choices.

* The pacing was off the entire movie.

* Lord Patrick's motivations were laughable which made his reveal later incredibly predictable. The fact that he had hardly any reason to help the crew or why they needed to ""operate through his office"" made the ""twist"" unbelievably telegraphed that he wanted to spy on them. ^(^Which ^if ^he ^can ^teleport ^unnoticed ^then ^he ^shouldn't ^need ^to ^spy ^in ^such ^a ^rudimentary ^way. ^It ^doesn't ^really ^add ^up, ^but ^I'll ^let ^that ^slide)

* The No Man's Land battle was pathetic. She was in a warzone yet there was only one machine gun and a handful of German soldiers shooting at her... In fact, most of the battles felt pretty safe. She was practically invincible. No enemy could touch her. She was *perfect* at fighting against weapons that she had never seen before. The only time she was truly vulnerable to being defeated was when she was trapped in metal by Ares with no foreseeable way out.

* The side characters were *beyond* lacking. They were meant to show Diana that humans are complex and not black and white, but instead they became useless dead weight for the majority of the film. They never had any character arcs (except for maybe the trigger-shy marksmen who got over his fear of singing lol). I can't stress this one enough. These side characters were so poorly written it's shameful. They are the main reason I am baffled when I see people giving this movie a 10/10 score.

* The Germans didn't recognize Steve in the gala even though they sent agents after him in the beginning.

* The hilariously bad plot device known only as the blue gas that amounted to absolutely nothing.

* Many people (even those who like the movie) will agree on this one. In the scene after she kills who she thought was Ares, she finds out that humans inherently have evil in them, but that they also inherently have good in them. Her view of the world was far too black & white. This was the only redeeming moment of the film in terms of character growth.... and then they trashed it by having Ares show up. (Can we talk about that weird sword reach edit when she first sees Ares or is that nitpicking?)

* Cue over-budgeted CGI boss fight with no rules. Ares has Zeus-like lightning and suddenly WW can fly. The ONLY Chekhov's Gun that was loaded (the shockwave we saw when she was training) and fired merely knocked him back and the battle of throwing dumb powers at each other raged on for another 5 minutes.

* A soldier named Steve sacrifices himself in a plane loaded with a German weapon of mass destruction. It felt way too unnecessary and forced (in order to motivate WW maybe(?)). Some people were telling me they teared up when they saw this scene so maybe I'm just a cold bastard.

* Speaking of forced, talk about that love story. Cliche and hardly deserving.

* Love conquers all... talk about banal.

The movie was nothing but cliche after cliche. 
People really wanted to like the movie because all the other recent DC films had been subpar, this one had a female lead, and the critics praised it. There are definitely clear flaws in the writing that don't add up. The biggest issue is that people are not rating it objectively. They enjoyed watching it, so they take the 0-10 rating scale and turn it into a 0|10 binary scale based on whether or not  the film was watchable. Don't get me wrong though, a lot of popcorn flicks are really fun to watch. Most of them don't deserve a near perfect rating.

digfnj4,"The comics have different runs. Each run is its own story. And anything you don't know, there's the internet to fill you in. Do you think I've read every single issue of Wonder Woman since it was first published? Of course not. No one has. But you can pick a run and read from there so you can get an understanding of the character. 

How do you know you won't like the comics until you even have a go at them? And, no, you don't need to like them all to be a fan. Take for example one of Wonder Woman's most polarizing runs, Brian Azzarello's turn. Personally, I love it. It has been my favorite run of Wonder Woman because it feels like Wonder Woman meets Sandman with the Greek Gods being like The Endless. But other fans hate this run with a passion of a thousand sons and are willing to start bar fights over it. To each their own. What I am saying, is you don't need to like all the runs. You don't need to read all the runs. But at least try it. Pick up a volume at your local library and dive in. What's the worst that can happen? You lose half an hour to a bad storyline.

All these characters go through the same kind of development. Clarks version was his father dying in the tornado. That helped to define his character to be more kind and open.Wonder Womans was to see the bigger picture.

Clarks story compared to Dianas makes him more human, more connected with the human psyche. In comparison Diana is very ignorant of the world around her because she was told all these lies by her mother, so she doesn't really understand what the world is really like, but in the film she begins to learn that not all people who do wrong are doing it to be bad, but they're just misunderstood.

She still believed that the God Killer Sword was the actual God Killer. She didn't even know what her bracers can do until that sparing scene with Antiope which was just the beginning and then the look on her and Steve's face when it deflected the bullet in the street scene also added to the exploration and development of what she was capable of doing. Her fellow Amazonians didn't even know she had healing powers because they have been so secluded and haven't really experienced war and death for some time. The whole movie was a great origin movie because the audience got to see the character evolve together. They didn't treat the audience as total idiots that needed an explanation to every single item. It's like in MoS, the only explanation of Superman's suit was that it was the garment under their armor that they wear, but it didn't explain why it doesn't get damaged or destroyed, and same with the cape.

I'm not a huge fan of a lot of the Marvel movies, mainly because they tend to follow a very predictable formula (which WW also slipped into during the 2nd half of the movie).

Maybe I just don't like superhero movies. But at least in a lot of the Marvel movies, there is a sense that the characters are in real danger in-universe (even though we know they have plot armor). 

Like I said, the movie was enjoyable to watch, like most superhero movies are, but it's entirely forgettable. 

I feel that if WW had either 

1) Cranked up the ""fish out of water"" humor to 11 (to the point where it's more of a comedy, a la Guardians of the Galaxy)

or

2) had a more gritty, realistic depiction of the war and her moral struggles (more along the lines of the Dark Knight)

And it's not really fair to compare Wonder Woman with the Winter Soldier or Civil War directly so I won't, but the action in those movies have set the bar in my opinion and Wonder Woman didn't quite reach it. 

Doctor Strange was similarly underwhelming in my opinion, and it too came of as a very generic and forgettable movie.

Women having something once in a while doesn't mean they're always being recognized on this way *consistently*. Wonder Woman, being a full on super hero all by herself, not being a love interest or side character like the damsels in distress or Black Widow, really shows something to them. Wonder Woman is a staple and will be around for a long time and hopefully more heroines come of it. 

Also to add, Wonder Woman is a great figure because she's a woman. She fights and kicks ass and is empowering not because she's doing masculine things or has masculine attributes, like say She Hulk.

dihlg99,"Again, another great explanation and something that could have been utilised by the film had some better editing choices been made, however to counter your point, my suggestion would be that she only reaches for the sword after the first conversation with Ares, implying that WW doesn't actually realise she doesn't have the sword and it would therefore have had no bearing on her actions or . There is literally no dialogue, facial expression or any kind of acting that takes place between WW realising she does not have the sword and her regaining posession of the sword. Ares monologues for a while whilst WW is under the impression she has the sword at her back -- Realisation is made -- Nothing happens -- No inclination is made that Ares is aware the sword is missing, nor that WW is suprised the sword isnt at her back -- WW retrieves sword and returns to the same spot -- Ares continues to Monologue and WW allows him too even while in posession of the sword. Pointless.

Had she reached for the sword, had her moment of realisation and stayed grounded for a while like you suggested, contemplating, planning her next move, allowing Ares to monologue for a little longer, that would have been great use of the missing sword moment. This didn't happen. 
Honestly the fact I posted this on reddit this morning and since then 3 people have come up with insightful ways DC could have used this particular moment to build the scene dramatically just goes to show how lacking the DC editing team really is.

It is up to the system to provide that justice and not himself. The movies haven't explicitly said that isn't the route he would ever take. But he does explicitly provide his justice in the newer movies. He has become the thing he said he would never want to be. He is basically his father if he became Batman, which did happen. Uses a gun and everything. 

Batman using a gun or killing people isn't really what I think should be the correct message he should send in the movies. This Batman is pro-gun and saying it's ok to kill people when the system doesn't come through for you. That's not what Batman has been all about.

dih5lvz,"Eh. Just in the Avengers, Vision, Hulk, Thor, and Iron Man (by extension War Machine too) can tank any artillery fired at them. Cap is vulnerable, yes, but his shield can absorb/deflect anything fired at him; although you can argue that him blocking them all of the time is due to plot-armor. Same with Scarlet Witch, but with her spells. I don't know how bullet-proof Spidey's suit is in the MCU (considering that it's made by Stark, I'm assuming it's very probable that it is), but his Spider-sense and agility effectively makes him immune to bullet fire anyway. 

That's easily the majority of the roster. Black Panther isn't really an Avenger but his suit also makes him immune to arms fire (it's lined with the same stuff as Cap's shield). The only members at real risk is Hawkeye, Black Widow, and maybe Falcon. And yes, I do remember that Quicksilver was indeed killed by bullets, but it was only because he used his own body as a meatshield to protect someone.

As far as the Justice League members, which is more inline with this thread, only Batman has anything to fear from weapons fire, and that's dependent on the suit he's wearing (he literally takes a bullet to the head in BvS using his regular suit in the warehouse scene). The rest of them are essentially walking gods - both in the current DCEU lineup and the classic JL lineup.

So no, saying ""most superheroes are actually in danger"" in the context of guns isn't really true, which is probably why you were downvoted. 

Personally, I definitely understand your opinion, and it's a pretty common fan complaint about Superman. It's also why guns are rarely treated as a threat in comic book stories/movies, unless it's used against hostages. In the the defense of WW's case though, we couldn't assume she was invulnerable to gunfire, because at that point of the story, it's natural to assume she was like the other Amazons, who were definitely vulnerable to bullets. Yeah, she is pretty much as strong as Superman in the comics and the other adaptations of her character, but we didn't know that about this iteration of her character in the DCEU. We as the audience didn't know she was the Godkiller yet - that was allegedly the sword. I mean she can't even fly in this version, and we literally saw her aunt and a number of her sisters killed ~30 minutes before to gunfire.",6erigc

Like, yeah, a lot of people wanted to kill her and would shoot her if they got the chance, but it seems too coincidental that the one person with a mask hiding a disfigurement (to me, it looked like that side of her face melted off, but they only showed it quickly/in bad lighting and I can't find a picture of her with her mask off so I don't really remember), also happens to be the person working with deadly chemicals that burns peoples' faces off. Nearly any other character could've had the mask (from other assassination attempts or their time in the army), but they chose it to be Doctor Poison and Doctor Poison only.

Also, a bit off topic, but this is part of what I loved about the movie. Obviously there was some exposition, but it felt like the movie trusted us with some basic stuff. Like, we don't *need* to know how Doctor Poison got injured and we can make assumptions/educated guesses without it being spelled out for us. We don't need Doctor Poison and General Luderdoff to tell us 'yes! this gas will crack open the gas masks so they won't have a way to defend against it'. They just show us them testing out the gas on a prisoner with a mask and getting mad that he doesn't die, and we can pick up the rest.

I think some of the glamour shots (like as soon as she jumps into no man's land and the camera is straight on her and she's all pouty lipped with wind blowing in her hair) are absolutely there to titillate the audience and it kind of reminds the audience to an extent that she has this historical baggage in her design that's mean to appease the male gaze. Now don't get me wrong, I don't think there is anything wrong with wonder woman being strong, beautiful, intelligent, and represent all the ideals of excellence (just like Thor, or Captain America). But the Glam Shots put way too much leering focus on her looks in a way that male super heroes aren't subjected to, and in that way it reduces some of her power as a feminist icon and recounts the original baggage of what she was created for-- to make a male's interpretation of ""empowering"" superman, aka, sexy superman in female form, skimpy outfit, dominatrix whip and all.

dji8m8v,"> Quite right as I recall it as well, but what we seem to disagree on is what is the Godslayer entails. Ares does NOT confirm that Diana's mother birthed her like any other child. He did not challenge the idea that Diana was sculpted from clay and granted life from Zeus. He merely confirms that the sword is but a toy and that the true Godslayer is Diana.

[To settle this I just bought the novelization for my Kindle - hey, my daughter will want to read it at some point I guess. What Ares says explicitly contradicts Hippolyta's statement ""I made you from clay and begged Zeus to give you life"". The exact words used, which sound familiar so I assume they're in the movie too, are ""Only a *God* can kill another God(...)Zeus left the daughter he had with the Queen of the Amazons as a weapon to use against me."" Diana's response to this is to accuse him of lying, which underlines the fact that her entire origin story as she knew it has just been thrown out of the window.](#spoiler)

[Now does he say she wasn't made of clay? Well technically, she could still be made of clay and that's how Gods make babies, likewise she could be delivered by a stork, or be made at Manticore with Zeus and Hippolyta's DNA, or any of a million other possibilities. Who knows how Gods are born? But there's no reason to believe she was, as everything else Hippolyta has said about her origin has just been revealed to be lies.](#spoiler)

[The answer to your original point though is resolved: she's not a terminator, she's an actual God, that's why she has feelings, it's why Ares wants to rule the world with her, and it's why we're saying you should ignore the clay story, because for all intents and purposes that's a lie her mother told her growing up to protect her from the truth and stop her from going out and getting killed by Ares.](#spoiler)",6erigc
djiauxd,"> Something like... I dunno, he takes that book Steve handed in and try to coax British scientist to develop their own horrible weapon. To use either as a deterrent in a zero sum game or as a preemptive strike. At least then his shift to being the true bad guy wouldn't be so jarring.

That would have been hitting you over the head with it. I didn't much like the revelation of Ares but I thought the playing-both-sides bit was actually done just the way it should have been. Ares himself argues he's not actually encouraging humans to fight, just providing them with the tools to do so. So a combination of helping Dr Poison, and [helping Steve Trevor do something that, if it goes wrong, will break the armistice and cause war to resume, that Trevor already wants to do](#spoiler) fits that exactly. If he'd handed the book to British scientists, it would have had to be very subtly done.

>I went to the cinema to be entertained by a movie, thst was achieved. Worth the ticket price and though I'm not saying it's a timeless masterpiece. It was a solid movie worthy of a good score and some hype.

The issue is that it's getting rated as high or higher than actual timeless masterpieces just based on the watchability of the film. An average film can still be plenty enjoyable! But just because it's enjoyable doesn't mean it deserves a 10/10. Many of my favorite movies are simply average and I can admit that they have flaws which *should* affect the overall rating.

>Eventually these scores drop down, people watch the movie a few times, people not interested in the genre grab it when it's on DVD.
>No, does it deserve high ratings and hype for its 5 minutes of fame. I think so

Hopefully they deflate, because it's a bit dishonest when a passable superhero movie like Wonder Woman gets reviews near perfect simply because it was enjoyable. The 0-10 scale is turning into a binary 0|10 scale because of that mentality.

>You might enjoy movies more if you don't come out of them trying to quantify their relevance to the history books and the movie industry on a whole.

> I believe they shied away from Diana being remorseful for every kill because it would have detracted from her badassery, but they did address the horrors of conflict through the other characters/scenes (Charlie's PTSD, the amputees coming off the boat, the soldiers/horses wounded on the trail to the front)

All of whom were Allied characters (ie the good guys).

> The only 'good guys' in the film were Steve and his rag-tag team of rebels. Diana talks down to the allied commanders (""that's what soliders do""), Steve goes against his direct orders not to follow-through with their plan to destroy the gas.

The good guys were the Allied in general asides from their leaders. No normal Allied soldiers are shown in a negative light at any point. No German soldiers are shown in a positive light, but they certainly are shown in a negative light. That seems like fairly distinct good/bad dynamics there.

Except for the Germans capturing people in the local villages for forced labour.  In fairness, this was a thing that happened, to a certain extent, but so was similar service in British colonies and elsewhere.  That would have been the perfect moment to have Diana reach the other side of the trenches, and hear the same story told about the British army, and realise how equal the two sides were in their barbarism at times.

I think the film did a good job of portraying the idea that war is hell, and it was pleasant to see some odd bits and pieces scattered around - the regiment of soldiers from India, for example, and the pain and agony in a lot of the scenes when they arrived at the war.  However, the biggest message that we must take from WW1 is that sometimes war isn't just hell, it's completely pointless.

They touch on this with the Chief's character, who says steve's people took our land, in the last war, or something to that effect.

The Germans are initially presented as the bad guys, because the one saying it is an American and he believes the germans are bad guys, and diane just lays out the germans with a smirk on her face, because she's naive to the duality of man. It's not because the film wants you to think that all the Germans were bad guys. After killing Ludendorff, thinking he is aries, and still believing that the germans are bad she is demoralized when this isn't the case. This is contradicted by the German command discussing peace, being killed by a man willing to kill innocents just to win a war with a great weapon.

After Aries is defeated, his influence on these particular super death gas soldiers, going on till the bitter end of the war, despite peace coming just around the corner, ends. After surviving a literal battle of the gods in front of them. Aries isn't simply the source of war, and humans aren't simply inherently good, these were just children stories, but he does have the power to inspire formulas for super death gas, and the willingness to use it on innocents and soldiers on both sides.

dienn83,"I consider him to be more of a concept than anything else, if you don't agree with that then sure he is just a weak villain with no real relevance, but one shouldn't separate what a character represents from the simple narrative storytelling - he IS War and that IS a big part of where he comes in imo.

There is a middle ground, 'working' is not the opposite of 'terrible and lazy', it's around the middle of the same scale that has 'awful' at one end and 'good' at the other; it ties him into things well enough but they could have easily involved him more in the story a little in order to tie him closer to the concept, or increase the impact (as you say, it wasn't exactly the most hard hitting thing ever) of the reveal, they could have just articulated it better, it is not a perfectly written film (far from it, in some places) but it works well enough.

Maybe you have a point, maybe it should have been done by the book but he's there as War and how do you do that without makig it seem heavy handed? I dunno, I'm sure there's a way but this way was okay.

I think X-Men films like the first 2 and DOFP kind of figured it. DOFP doesn't have too much action and more drama in it.  You can't make them simple dumb save the day the films which Wonder Woman did suffer from but for me, it was just refreshing to see something no formulatic as Marvel. 

I do think Marvel films have no danger.  We all know everyone is coming back for the sequels.  Guardians 2 was the only one that had the balls to kill someone.

I'll have to see how it holds up on repeated viewings.  I liked that it was a mix of tones and that it felt like a fun action adventure movie to me.  I wasn't sold on Gal as a lead and I'm just impressed that DC had an entertaining movie after so many years for someone besides Batman.  I think it's a solid action adventure film and the action sequences were enjoyable (the cgi needed to be improved and good lord that slowmo)  But yeah solid 7 is a fine score but I don't think 7 is a bad score at all.

digvsf0,"The tipping point for me being excited to see the movie was watching Chris Stuckmann's review, at which point I was like ""yeah alright I'm pretty sure at this point it's not just plants on reddit"", but one of the things he said was that this movie was ""colorful"". What? The first thirdish was relatively colorful, but they were on a tropical island. The rest of the movie was as desaturated and covered in smoke and grime as pretty much anything I've ever seen. I mean, it makes sense, it was post-industrialized London and then trench warfare, but still. Not especially colorful. I mean, there were times when I think literally everything on screen was a shade of blue.

Also, I think you're totally right about the number of cliches in the movie. It's crazy! I don't think anything in the movie surprised me, it felt extremely by-the-numbers, and that kind of leads me to my sneaking suspicion about the movie: that *it's not for me*.

I, like a lot of us I imagine, am a guy in my early 20s, and counting repeat viewings I've probably seen like 50-100 superhero movies over the past ten years. It's hard for them to surprise me at this point. BUT, and I'm not going to go back and make 100% sure, but I bet *every single one of them* has a male protagonist. Every last one. And while Wonder Woman isn't supposed to be strictly ""female power!"", and is largely intended to just be a good movie with broad appeal that focuses on a female superhero, I have to believe that it's a *little bit* intended for the audience that hasn't really participated in all the buzz this past decade; for the people that have felt alienated by not being adequately represented. So while all these plot points are extremely familiar to *me*, it could also act as let's-bring-you-up-to-speed movie for the people that *haven't* been going to them all these years. Just to get the gist of them; a way to bring new fans into the fold.

I mean, the people a couple seats over from me in the theater were a mom with her young daughter on her lap, and the little girl was lovin' that shit. And that was kind of cool to see, even if it didn't make *me* like the movie more. Because while the female-led action movie's not as rare as it used to be, it's still kind of a big deal, and they definitely knew that. So maybe the target audience isn't us jaded twenty-somethings, and that's fine.

And I did like the movie, there were parts that really worked for me; I thought Gadot was funny and adorable during the fish-out-of-water bits in London, I thought she and Pine did have pretty good chemistry, Pine was reliably good overall, a lot of the fights were pretty solid even if I wasn't crazy about the slo-mo, her outfit is awesome, the music was pretty good, etc.

But I would be lying if I said that my feeling leaving the theater wasn't ""that was alright, and I'll never watch it again"".

So I do think the praise is a bit overblown. In a lot of ways I think the DC universe is like a car and the engine's been failing to turn over (critically, at least), and this was the first key turn where we felt it start to catch a bit, and everyone's collectively willing it to get going, and maybe if we cheer enough this could just turn into something really good.",6erigc

In terms of WW and this moment I think you're over stressing the point a bit. But with BvS this was definitely a problem. And I don't mean on the larger plot level editing of the order of scenes. I mean at the scene level narrative with the edit driving the audience's understanding of the scenes.

You know that scene where Lex meets Finch and the other senator to talk to them about Kryptonite? That finishes with a close up of Lex after he delivers this cringey line doing an impression of Finch's accent. So the narrative take away is that Lex is weird and creepy. But really what that scene should have ended on was shots of Finch and the other senator reflecting on the dilemma Lex was putting to them. That would have been a much better way to end the scene and done good things for all three characters. Lex would look like someone with a plan rather than just creepy and Finch would look like someone who had a big choice to make. But those shots weren't used so that narrative thread was lost. And the scene where she goes to tell him later that she's denied his request would have much greater narrative resolution. All for the sake of a more considered scene edit. There's lots of issues like that in BvS where they had the shots but didn't use them in the edit to craft a coherent narrative. Things that should make sense as you're watching it.",6erigc

And that he could come up with this plan and convey it to at least one of his companions, and still make it onto the plane, and be able to trust that the remaining two could still successfully fight past the German forces and destroy the warehouse stockpile?",6erigc

dj9fq75,"What do you mean the science was flawed?  They consulted one of the world's leading theorists in general relativity to make that movie.  Even the impossible things they did were crafted in such a way that they didn't contradict the theories that are currently accepted within the physics community.

I actually have a degree in physics, and nothing jumped out at me as glaringly wrong about the physics in Interstellar.  In fact I was somewhat awestruck at their apparently accurate renderings of black holes.  People nitpick well constructed movies like this all the time, and I can't help but think that they're actively trying to nitpick--that it's one of the ways in which they derive pleasure from these movies, the nitpicking--that they go into every sci-fi movie assuming that the physics is messed up, excited to sniff out all the little blunders and gloss-overs and (maybe going too far here...) immediately point them out to all their friends after the movie to prove how intelligent they are.

dil0pqu,"##Amazon River
The Amazon River, usually abbreviated to Amazon (US /ˈæməzɒn/ or UK /ˈæməzən/; Spanish and Portuguese: Amazonas), in South America is the largest river by discharge volume of water in the world and according to some authors, the longest in length.

The headwaters of the Apurímac River on Nevado Mismi had been considered for nearly a century as the Amazon’s most distant source, until a 2014 study found it to be the Cordillera Rumi Cruz at the headwaters of the Mantaro River in Peru. The Mantaro and Apurímac confluence, and with other tributaries form the Ucayali River, which in turn confluences with the Marañón River upstream of Iquitos, Peru, to form what countries other than Brazil consider to be the main stem of the Amazon. Brazilians call this section the Solimões River above its confluence with the Rio Negro to form what Brazilians call the Amazon at the Meeting of Waters (Portuguese: Encontro das Águas) at Manaus, the river's largest city.

This is a straw man. I wasn't just talking ""in the context of guns,"" and I'm not even just talking about in the middle of battle when they're prepared for it. 

Also, you strangely limited to a couple movies. For example, the Guardians of the Galaxy are pretty much all vulnerable to being killed in-universe. I mean sure, we have baby Groot now, but the Groot as we knew him died. 

It also isn't hard to kill most X-Men. Whenever they're on a mission, they're in danger.

Maybe before the No Man's Land scene. It became clear that she was not in any danger whatsoever. And then this was definitely dispelled when she just ignored the gas.

While they were never given to women and hers was very advanced compared to the ones used, they were HUGE advancements for the psychological care of wounded vets and for the field of plastic surgery. So in the end it's probably not relevant to me whether it was the toxin burning off her flesh or somebody taking a potshot at the deadliest German chemist on the front in an attempt to take her out (as I said, that was my assumption, as she was a valuable and deadly target). It was just neat they included that detail, as it was a huge and very significant medical tool specific to WWI alone.

But I also very much enjoyed that about this film! I think Doctor Poison's entire arc and inclusion was emblematic of that aspect of the film--the lack of hand-holding in many parts of the movie. It was really well done in terms of showing and not telling and avoiding overloading us with exposition nonsense. Indeed, (if you'll allow me to med history nerd out for a second) the very fact that nobody comments on her mask is deeply indicative of that lack of hand-holding--it's historically accurate, as most people become quickly familiar with those masks as a necessity, given how many men were disfigured in such a way. Many were familiar with the use of such a prosthesis, given how many men were in the military and knew someone who had ended up needing one, and how many people at the very least had someone close to them in the military who either might have needed one themselves or known someone who was injured and used one to hide the aftermath. At that point in the war (towards the end), nobody would've been impolite enough to remark on a mask like hers, and making a big deal out of it would've been nothing but handholding or signalling for the audience themselves!

It shows a difference in how male leads are being written now, even  compared to just a few years ago, where it was still basically a given that the male lead would be a womanizer because with men, sex is associated with power. If it were a female lead, her sleeping around would likely be framed as bad or as something wrong with her. 

Now we have a few decidedly less promiscuous male heroes like Captain America, Steve Trevor and even Sam Wilson who has no known romantic links to anyone. 

Also consider the backlash against Black Widow and Hulk hooking up. Audiences don't want unnecessary romance/sex anymore and don't need it to relate to/value a character.

she is supposed to be. There is nothing wrong with women characters being comic. Not every women has to be ""strong and independent"" , especially in 1918.

>Dr. Poison is completely subservient.

Agree. I expected her to be the main villain or at least receive her backstory, how she got her facial scars.

>WW even refers to noncombatants as ""women and children.

Yeah, that was weird for WW to say that. 

>You do make a good point that that the Greek depiction of Amazons looks pretty similar to the costume design, but the other half of that design is the original WW costume, which is WAAAAAY oversexualized.

What do you mean?

>The first time she pulls off that black fur coat to reveal her colorful gladiatress armor, she looks like a latex cheerleader and that's bullshit. Even Xena's costume design looks less schoolgirl than that skimpy little number.

Again, why is being sexy wrong? Why cannot a women be sexy and also be badass? If you say DCEU makes every other female characters sexualized, you can see that is clearly not the case. Even the dress Diana wore in BvS, were very revealing and sexy. I don't see what exactly is wrong with being sexy. In both Man of Steel and BvS, Henry Cavil and Ben Affleck had sexy scenes. Every superhero in DCEU and MCU is sexy.

If every female characters were unnecessarily sexualized in DCEU, then it would be a problem. 

>I think this movie in general is several steps forward for female leads in the male-dominant superhero genre - but that's only because they're so many steps behind, and there's still a looooong way to go.

And nice tu quoque on the ""talking down to someone"" comment. You completely failed to address the accusation.

And if you want to compare her to the shirtless Superman, you don't understand what male gaze *is*. Superman is a male ideal, he is a power fantasy to men. He is filmed and framed and shown as being powerful. Female superheroes are not given the same treatment in film. They are framed and shot and shown as objects of desire - not as powerful.

As for being treated like any other hero, but judged for being a woman, that's the result of the hypocrisy of our current society. We can not ignore the fact that she is a woman, because in our current culture she will be judged for being a woman no matter what. Her movie is unfairly the linchpin on which the immediate future funding of female led superhero films will be judged. If she fails they all fail, because ""well, women led movies don't sell"".

It is literally impossible to discuss her character in a genderless bubble. The fact that she is being treated like any other superhero *in spite* of her gender is what makes her special.

I sincerely hope that one day very soon that will not be the case. I want all future female led movies to be discussed without their gender being an issue. But until there are more of them? Until people stop saying the film was ""nothing but praise because it has a female lead""? That's just not possible.",6erigc
djibbto,"**I do not dispute Diana's godhood.** I question whether Diana had an actual choice in fighting against Ares. Is she a subject of free will?

The reason Diana came into begin was not because of love between Zeus and Hippolyta or a one night stand. She came into being **SPECIFICALLY TO BE A COUNTERMEASURE AGAINST ARES.** That is her purpose, her destiny as dictated by Zeus. If she's destined to fight against Ares as the Godslayer, then deity or mortal, she has **NO CHOICE** in the matter. It is classical trope from Greek myth that **NO ONE**, not even *the gods themselves* can defy fate. The movie seems to be very much in line with this, since despite the Queen's most sincere efforts (discourage training, forbid her to leave the island), Diana goes out into the world and eventually confronts Ares.

Ergo... ***no choice = no free will, not all that different from a Terminator.*** While a Terminator is far more rigid in its approach to its purpose/mission, it has no choice in whether it will attempt it or not. 

This lack of choice or agency is something I find highly problematic. 

The only lie Hippolyta tells Diana is who/what the Godslayer actually is. We the audience, as well as Diana, are led to believe that it is that darn sword. The clay part is, as far as I know, very much a real option. At least until we get more information in the sequel or whatever.",6erigc
dk43uw7,"> Do you have a problem with her learning Navajo?

Now that you mention it, yes. I do. I didn't mention it because my original post was as long as it could be. 

Diana's knowledge of the outside world is something I consider inconsistent with the complete isolation that the Amazon society is supposed to have. They have no interest in whatever is going on beyond their little barrier. Once that barrier went up, whatever knowledge they had of the outside world would be rendered redundant/meaningless and discarded. 

It'd make sense that the Queen commanded it, especially after Diana was ""born."" Simply to prevent Diana from being exposed to temptation about the outside world by learning about it. Ignorance is bliss and all that jazz.

>Maybe she learned about human sex because she thought it was interesting and she couldn't wait for a time to pull out her knowledge and show it off -  like you just did with the born sexy yesterday trope. It's literally only existed for two months and, yes, I learned about it when the video came out just like you did.

The video that explains what the trope is refers to movies that are far older than 2 months. Just because the trope didn't have a formal name until recently doesn't mean it didn't exist before. Though yes, I did learn of its formal name and just what it entails quite recently.",6erigc

And the 9/10 score I'd give the movie is only based on how I personally enjoyed the movie and is therefore purely subjective. Sure when you want to give an objective review taking account of everything good and everything the movie could have done better a 9/10 would probably be too high. However in my personal opinion this movie was like 90 % of the time one of the most enjoyable and entertaining movies I've seen in a long time. So as I said my score is purely based on how I enjoyed the movie. But it's totally okay if you expected more from this movie. 

Also I wouldn't say that all movies ""entertain"". Let's say the anime ""grave of the fireflies"" (火垂るの墓）(Don't know if you now it). I personally would give that movie a 10/10. But although being a really great movie I wouldn't exactly say I was entertained in the meaning of ""I had fun watching it"" actually quite the opposite it was depressing/sad af at some points.

So they establish that she has regenerative healing abilities...and then never refer to that again?

So why would you establish that in the first place? Why would you focus on that cut healing itself if it's never going to be called back to again? It seemed like they couldn't decide how powerful they wanted her to be so they decided to walk the line between mortality and being a god. She can lift a tank, toss it to its side, but she can get cut by a blade? And then she later catches a sword with her bare hands...but doesn't get cut that time? How come? 

Like I said, the writing and character development were seriously subpar in this movie. Know your characters, know their abilities, know their strengths, and definitely know their weaknesses going into writing a movie. This felt like they made things up as they went along. If she can heal herself, I would have had her get shot at some point during the battle. (I mean, go watch a movie like Saving Private Ryan or Hacksaw Ridge. The bullets in a war like that come from everywhere. They're not just going to come in a nice single file line for her to deflect at her own choosing.) Establish that she is vulnerable to gunfire, that way the stakes are higher when she deflects bullets. If you show her self-heal and be seemingly invincible, the stakes of a scene like No Man's Land is significantly lower because we know she can't be harmed.

I haven't read any WW comics in the last 10 years, but as a kid I saw WW as no lesser than any other DC hero (except maybe Flash, I love Flash).

Personally I didn't have a problem with the CGI until the end. Even people who liked it have lamented that the final battle was a mess. If it makes you feel any better, the lasso stuff was really cool.

As for the acting? It has nothing to do with the action. We're talking about conveying emotion. 

1) Diana and Steve's sidekicks were 1 dimensional and cheesily acted. 

2) The general and dr. poison were cartoons and goofy when otherwise the gas story line tied into the WWI setting perfectly, and their weird relationship with each other was actually interesting. There should have been more/longer uncomfortable scenes between them. The film should have also shown slightly more gruesome scenes of the gas being tested, or at least made the village after being gassed a little more detailed.

3) The best actor in this movie was Pine. By far. It had nothing to do with ""rolls"" (whatever you meant by that). His monologue when he's talking about how humans can just be bad sometimes and it has nothing to do with Ares was super convincing. It had a great amount of emotion and wasn't ""overacted"". Also, the scene where he tells Diana that he loves her, you almost didn't even need his voice to feel like he had developed deep feelings for her.

4) Diana's final monologue just before defeating Ares is actually one of the best written parts of the movie and she delivers it like Microsoft Sam. There's no fire in her voice. The whole ""naive, confused, lost girl"" excuse for her bad acting definitely doesn't work here. I think everyone needs to admit it's either bad acting or bad directing at fault here. 

Moving forward in the DCEU, Diana is going to have to get more human for her character to fit in the universe and not be so boring, and I have a strong feeling Gidot's acting isn't going to get much better, unless Whedon can bring something out of her (and I hope he doesn't rely on his increasingly banal snark to make her more interesting).",6erigc

die9p14,"I feel like there's only two ways that a superhero film can rejuvenate anything:

1. Go full Mad Max: FR on everything by trimming down the plot, only including the most concise story beats, and then making everything around the plot (characters, action, visuals, etc.) so freaking awesome, polished, and well done that you can't help but feel alive as every last bit of the film explodes in the best possible way you can think of.

2. Do something completely different by taking the characters and images of superhero movies and putting them in something which, while still revolving around the heroes, falls into a completely different genre. For example, a drama about a guy going insane with jealousy over Superman, or a flat-out horror film where the characters are trying to escape Carnage as he infects an entire city. 

I don't think that the problem is that there's nothing to do with these characters. I think the problem is that the people making them refuse to think outside the box. Sure, there's nothing wrong with taking the already existing formula and making a fun enough film like WW out of it, but if there's no evolution then these characters will just be stuck in the same repetitive formula instead of being something that could be, if not new, then incredibly fresh and interesting. **Somebody - director, producer, or otherwise - just needs to take charge and make a completely, 1000% different superhero film already.

Making decisions based upon a map in front of them, with no actual sympathy for the people they commanded. This came up especially when the British general said ""that's what soldiers are for, they die."" This was actually a major problem in WW1, the generals and commanders of the army weren't actual career military tacticians, most of them were aristocrats who happened to be in charge of the army. Diana could clearly see this, even though she had never met these people before in her life.

Now where does she know what makes a good general? There are plenty of examples, but there are some really good ones in Greek and Roman history. The best representation of the idea of generals leading from the front is Caesar, who would very often take direct command of his forces from the front line. This won him the respect of his men, while simultaneously allowing him to make impressive tactical maneuvers as the battle was unfolding. Contrasted with the Battle of Cannae, which was the worst Roman defeat in history in which the generals were appointed aristocrats who directed the army from way behind the front lines.

>Maybe I'm in the minority, but that scene kind of exemplified what I didn't really like about the movie.

>In-universe, most superheroes are actually in danger. As an audience, you know they have plot armor, but in theory they could be harmed. I've never seen a Hulk movie, so I don't know about him specifically, but Tony Stark could totally be killed. So could Captain America. Or Spiderman. In the DC universe, Batman is a mere mortal.

I was addressing these comments directly. Considering the context of the OP and the previous replies, I thought the topic was about guns and superheroes. Are we not talking about the No Man's Land scene anymore? The one in which WW went out into a battlefield to tank machine-gun fire (drawing fire from Steve and co.) and liberated the town by eliminating the enemy soldiers who had guns.

I thought your second was still referring to the first and OP's. Guns were used against all of those characters you listed in their respective movies too after all. Hulk failed at committing suicide via gun as well as taking on an entire army in his solo movie (including tanks), Iron Man took on multiple terrorist groups single-handledly in both his prototype armor and his finalized suit in his first movie (also had a tank), Spider-man stops armed robbers in every single movie he's in, Cap solos squads of Nazis in the First Avenger with his shield (more tanks), and Batman's a god damn ninja who don't ever get hit by bullets (and when he does, his suit stops it like in BvS). None of those characters were ever at any risk at any point of their respective movies as far as guns were concerned.

>Also, you strangely limited to a couple movies.

I selected those characters because A, those were the ones you listed. B, including Spider-man and Thor coming out this year, 14 out of the 17 MCU movies are about Avengers members. And C, they're the analogous Marvel team to DC's Justice League. I thought it was apropos considering we're in a thread about Wonder Woman, and it's what the DCEU currently consists of and in the foreseeable future.

Again, I assumed we were still on the guns topic, which was all I wanted to address in my previous comment. I see that any further superhero power analysis is moot.

> Maybe before the No Man's Land scene. It became clear that she was not in any danger whatsoever. And then this was definitely dispelled when she just ignored the gas. 

Again, how were you, as a first-time viewer, supposed to know that she wasn't in any danger? From the facts presented to us at that point in time, we were led to believe she was like any other Amazon and could be killed by said bullets like the rest of her kin on Themyscira. She as a character was also under that very impression, but she entered the battlefield because she felt like it was the right thing to do. She didn't know she was a demigod, but she braved what she perceived as a real threat to her anyway. A bigger obstacle and threat than the one that killed her aunt in the previous act. Her supporting characters (Steve in particular) thought and felt the same way, hence their exasperation in that scene. We as an audience were supposed to feel the same way too, hence the overwhelming positive response to said scene in this thread.

Which brings up another point, are we really sure she's invulnerable against bullets in the movie? She didn't take any direct hits from bullets in the movie, except during the beach scene on Themyscira. Was her arm not wounded by a grazed bullet? The fact that she wasn't hit again shows off her battle prowess - much like it did with Captain America in The First Avenger. It's not like she tanked a shot to the face and shrugged it off like many of the other high durability superheroes would like Wolverine, Deadpool, Hulk, Luke Cage, Thor, Black Panther, Iron Man, Groot, Drax, and the rest of the Justice League (Batman included in BvS). How is that any less of an achievement than what other heroes could've done?

As for the gas, again, we as the audience and WW's character didn't know she was impervious to the gas. We had no evidence to the contrary up until that point. Despite that, she ran into the town out of desperation in order to try to save the townsfolk anyway. We and she didn't realize until after the fact, that she was indeed immune to its effects. Does that not highlight her compassion and heroism? At the root of it, this is why the rest of us enjoy those particular scenes so much. The potential risk was never her priority. Saving people was.

I can understand your disappointment in the realization that in reality, she probably wasn't in any risk after all is said and done (I did say it was a common complaint about heroes like Superman in my previous post). But as a viewer and as far as WW's character is concerned, we weren't privy to that information beforehand, so how could it influence our experience of it while watching it? This is why the rest of us still think the No Man's Land scene succeeds at displaying WW's heroism, love, and bravery.

And honestly, how does her overwhelming her enemies not make her look bad ass? Did the Rohirrim's calvalry charge diminish the siege at Helm's Deep? Did Batman clearing out the thugs in the warehouse in BvS make him look less of a bad ass because he dominated them? Was Ip Man any less amazing because he clearly outskilled the ten karate-ka he fought simultaneously?

I sensed anger in that moment -- as if those were words he once lived by faithfully and now he realizes they are false. He almost spits them out with disgust.  His brilliance no longer gives him power in the presence of Superman -- he's an ant like everyone else.

Superman ultimately challenged his world view. He thought anything with ultimate power is evil at its core. ""Devils come from above"". So he tried to bring that evil out of Superman by setting the circumstances where Klark would be forced to commit a crime.

That being said, they could have made Dr. Poison have a revelation and switch sides, turning the tides of the conflict, or they could have made the secretary have a moment of power (shooting down a government official for being rude or something).  Or hell, they could have had some female random passer-by on the street throw a rock or punch a German soldier in the no man's land fight or something.  They had every opportunity to empower their female characters - the fact that they didn't empower anyone but WW is ridiculous.  

There is nothing wrong with women being comic relief, except when there is a deficit of strong female characters, then it's insulting.

WW's costume design was inspired by many things - the rough design was the Greek depiction, the color scheme and how short the skirt is in the front and back was a reference to the original WW costume design, and I don't know why it's latex.  It could've been a lot worse, but it could have been a lot better too.  

The problem with sexualizing strong female characters in Hollywood is that it communicates to young women that in order to be cool they need to show skin - titillate men - and that's not true.  Of course you don't need to hide women's bodies either - there's a middle ground (again, Xena's costume design is a good example of a fusion of sexiness and actual functionality) and this outfit is clearly about titillation, because that skirt is REALLY short, and WW has some major vulnerable areas exposed (no pun intended) - just so they could show some skin.  They showed in the movie that she can still be hurt by bullets, and her heart is completely vulnerable - yes she's got the shield and bracers, but she loses the shield several times in the movie, and what happens if she gets shot with more than two bullets (one for each bracer).  Also, there's a difference between having isolated instances where the character is sexy and having something as fundamental as the character's costume - their core identity - be sexualized.  Anyway, this is definitely a lesser issue because the character of WW was portrayed as being very strong and capable.

djslrrq,">You just handwaved all of the legitimate praise for the movie out of the way because ""it has a female lead"". Which is more likely? That we're all suffering a mass hallucination, saw a different movie than you did, or that you totally missed the point?

I was criticizing the comments like yours that try to forgive the movie's flaws because of the lead role's gender. 

I also didn't say that the movie didn't deserve praise. I said the movie isn't *deserving* of the praise it's getting because most of the praise it's getting is dismissive about objective flaws in the film. Is the film deserving of praise? Sure! Is it deserving of the *actual* praise it's getting? Probably not.

>And nice tu quoque on the ""talking down to someone"" comment. You completely failed to address the accusation.

I never made an argument that you were wrong about /u/FunkieDunkie talking down to you. I merely pointed out that you were being a hypocritical self-righteous asshole.

>And if you want to compare her to the shirtless Superman, you don't understand what male gaze is. Superman is a male ideal, he is a power fantasy to men. He is filmed and framed and shown as being powerful. Female superheroes are not given the same treatment in film. They are framed and shot and shown as objects of desire - not as powerful.

I can't even begin to argue how ludicrous that is. I was making a comparison of the sexualization of female superheroes to the sexualization of male superheroes. It is a direct comparison. Somehow you are trying to blame ""male gaze"" on sexy Superman? Lol

>As for being treated like any other hero, but judged for being a woman, that's the result of the hypocrisy of our current society. We can not ignore the fact that she is a woman, because in our current culture she will be judged for being a woman no matter what. Her movie is unfairly the linchpin on which the immediate future funding of female led superhero films will be judged. If she fails they all fail, because ""well, women led movies don't sell"".

First of all, that's a terrible reason to rate a film higher. It's terribly patronizing to women that you set the bar lower just so that women led movies get higher ratings. Pushing your political agenda in favor of accurately judging a movie is how you get more garbage on the big screen. Think about it- Hollywood sees that an inexpensive and average female led superhero movie gets off the chart ratings and makes a boatload of money. Hollywood recognizes that more people will pay to see an average female led superhero movie and rate it much higher than usual simply to push an agenda. Thus, Hollywood says, ""Passable cheap movies starring women are highly profitable."" So you end up with more popcorn flicks starring women because you decided to push an agenda instead of demanding better.

>It is literally impossible to discuss her character in a genderless bubble. The fact that she is being treated like any other superhero in spite of her gender is what makes her special.

She isn't being treated like any other superhero though, you said it yourself above. The movie is being judged with a padding, which other superheroes don't get.

>I sincerely hope that one day very soon that will not be the case. I want all future female led movies to be discussed without their gender being an issue.

As do I.

djierpn,"I think you raise an interesting point.

I'll be honest, I think ""Is a God"" and ""Has no free will"" are mutually exclusive. Diana is fulfilling her destiny, sure. Did she have that destiny because it was programmed into her? Or did Zeus [father her](#spoiler) knowing that anyone in her position - an Amazon Goddess - would sympathize with humanity, and inevitably side with them against Ares? I think we can rule out the first, because it's fundamentally incompatible with being a God. It's also obviously something that Ares doesn't believe either, because he's quite willing to try to convince his [half sister](#spoiler). 

Diana's journey is one of a warrior who's been told that Ares is the worst, and who sees for herself the misery Ares has wrought. Part of your objection to her depiction answers your question: you got pretty annoyed that she didn't just focus on Ares, but took breaks along the way to relieve the suffering of those she believes Ares is hurting. When she finally meets Ares, she's able to be stopped, and hears him out, it's certainly possible that Ares, if he hadn't been doing what he was doing, might have convinced her to stop.

In short, Diana makes reasonable decisions based upon what she sees and how she's been brought up. They happen to coincide with her supposed destiny.

Sorry, I am unfamiliar with that work. That being said, I never claimed that all movies entertain. I just said that it was the bare minimum they can do for success. That's an entirely different can of worms however. Clearly there are multiple factors that should be evaluated when watching a movie otherwise a movie like Wonder Woman will get a 10/10 for being ""entertaining enough"" while Grave of the Fireflies will get a 0/10 because it wasn't entertaining.

If the movie has ended on that note, it would have make Wonder Woman into an even better movie.

That's not to say she's bad.  Not at all.  Just that she isn't some unambiguously good beacon of virtue.  Which is part of why I like the movie.  War is hell, there's good and bad on both sides, and the movie addresses that.

Plus I would argue that WW did do some things that were unique to it and not merely a copy of what MCU does. Its humor was less about wisecracks and more just fluid conversation between people who didn't understand each other. Its ragtag support team is ineffective but by design: to show that when we look at people with compassion rather than by assessing their worth, then everyone has something to contribute in a conflict, even if not in the way we expect or in the ways we think ""count"" (e.g., the same way the Scottish marksman who can't actually shoot still serves a purpose on the team and can still be valued, and not because he's going to get his mojo back later in some clutch moment or because they're all BFFs). It had a love interest who wasn't useless or nerfed so that the hero would shine; he consistently had his own role to play that neither overshadowed the hero nor felt overshadowed by the hero's presence.

Sure, maybe Batman took more punishment than is realistic, and some of the science might be fudged, but there aren't people flying around shooting lasers from their eyes.  Having Superman or WW show up would have screwed those movies up royally.  

In my opinion, they should have more or less followed the Marvel model and gotten solo movies out with these characters before doing the ensemble movies.  The only DC:EU moves prior to BvS was Man of Steel.  Batman is essentially rebooted with Affleck and there had never been a WW movie.  

They should have introduced Affleck's batman in isolation while making it clear that it was now part of a bigger world.

I just think it makes sense considering what she saw during the war, her understanding, her loss and the whole deal with Ares. After all in the story told by her mother she was told that the godkiller was specifically left to kill ares. The whole island was prepared for her, the amazons true purpose was to protect Diana while she was a child and train her in their arts so that she would be capable of defeating Ares. Accomplishing that means that Diana's purpose in the world has been accomplished and considering that she is technically immortal taking off a hundred years to think about stuff is not really that long. 

Plus wasn't it implied that she was basically retrieving and collecting ancient artifacts from people who would misuse them in BvS? They had that conversation about the sword and something else. It could mean that she was basically running around the world collecting all the artifacts the greek gods left in a safe place or something like that. ",6erigc

The only thing she acomplishes is learning people are fucked up for no good reason, war is part of human nature and nothing she can do will ever stop it.

I think thematically Ares makes sense in terms of what he turned out to be instead of what she believed he was. He wasn't the root cause of the war. He was just trying to get men to get on with their own self destruction. He gave Dr Poison the formula. But it was her choice to develop it into a weapon.

djtgysh,"Speaking of congestive dissonance: 

> I also didn't say that the movie didn't deserve praise. I said the movie isn't deserving of the praise it's getting because most of the praise it's getting is dismissive about objective flaws in the film. Is the film deserving of praise? Sure! Is it deserving of the actual praise it's getting? Probably not.

What's the difference between praise and actual praise? All I've read so far is that this film is undeserving.

Also, very few people have claimed it's flawless. Most people have said that it was so enjoyable that their criticisms were very mild and could be written off as usual comic book movie logic.

Also, I'm not name calling. I've never called anyone in this thread a ""hypocritical asshole"". I'm calling out disproportionately aggressive vitriol. The worst I've done is say that certain comments are dismissive. If you actually *read* what I wrote, you would see that.

Proof that you're either not reading or not comprehending what I wrote: I never ""blamed the male gaze on sexy Superman"". I said it was a false equivalency because one is a male power trip, and the other is objectifying.

I'm not sure if it's a reading comprehension issue or you're filtering my comments through some sort of distortion filter, but you're clearly not understanding the social issues here, and blatantly ignoring the social context this movie exists in. *I'm* not setting the bar low here. Society has. Our current cultural climate has. And ignoring that is extremely dismissive of the complex issues that this movie handled so well.

I'm not giving her a free pass because she's a woman.

I'm giving her credit for a nuanced portrayal of war, a woman operating in a mans world, a variety of racial and social injustices, and for navigating the minefield of the current social situation with such grace that people like you didn't even notice it.

Sure, the CG in the 3rd act wasn't flawless. Sure the mustache was a questionable costuming choice. But really? That against *everything else* the movie did so well? It was a damn good movie. Trying to argue that it's undeserving of it's praise shows a lack of understanding here.",6erigc
djiirv8,"> I think we can rule out the first, because it's fundamentally incompatible with being a God. It's also obviously something that Ares doesn't believe either, because he's quite willing to try to convince his half sister. 

Incompatible if you're thinking about the Judeo-Christian God, but the Greek gods were not all powerful. Even they feared the [sisters of fate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moirai), for their words were final and absolute. Granted, they're not mentioned in the movie once and I'm not sure if they're present at all in DC's interpretation of ancient Greek myth. Which is fine, they don't have to. Marvel's take on Norse mythology deviates from the source material and I'm cool with that. However, until it's confirmed one way or the other that fate dictated by gods cannot be defied in the DCEU, I'm going with the classical Greek myth answer and say no. At least as far as this movie is concerned. If it gets elaborated later on or retconed or whatever, that's fine too.

And Ares... well, he and Diana were only destined to fight one another. The outcome of the fight would be anyone's guess. Hence the extra hard training for Diana. Hence the temptation. Anything to tip the battle one way or the other. This is in stark contrast to say... mythological Thor who's destined to fight and die at the hands of [Jörmungandr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6rmungandr#Final_battle).

I honestly don't know how to clarify anymore than what I've already done in my previous post nor how many more times I have to repeat myself. I literally quoted you and OP, and said I was originally responding to that in particular.

> Yes, 100%. The movie explicitly stated that only another god can kill a god. 

100%... really? You're making it sound like everything we've been presented with are hard facts, when the ""facts"" we have been given are hazy at best and untrue at worst. How much truth was there to Ares' influence on man, the ""Godkiller"" sword, the nature of mankind, or Diana's true origins? Can we really trust Ares' word, the villain who has been deceiving and manipulating everyone since the beginning?

If Hippolyta is still her true mother, then Diana will technically be a demigod. They didn't disprove that she was still her mother. Why does this matter? Well, demigods' powers in mythology operate under different rules than true gods, and they can definitely be slain. We don't know if they do in this universe or not either. Maybe Zeus did knock Hippolyta up. I mean that's the kinda thing he would do in mythology - still would make her a demigod.

How did Ares die if she's not really a god, if we assume that statement is true then? One can argue that Ares technically killed himself, because WW redirected his lightning bolt back at him, like how Voldemort managed to kill himself when his curse backfired. After all, as far as I know, WW has never had lightning powers in any of her iterations.

Also, the word ""daughter"" itself is misleading. Zeus bringing her life from clay still makes her his daughter, like how Frankenstein's monster is technically Frankenstein's son. Does that mean that her immortality works the same way as the other ""natural-born"" gods? Who knows? Until we get some answers from Hippolyta, we can't be sure. 

And for extra clarification, immortality does not mean unkillable. The other Amazons are ""immortal"" but they can be killed. Immortality just means they won't die from natural age and/or disease.

> It healed on its own within minutes, remember?

Only proves that she heals fast, and the wound was to her arm.  It doesn't prove that she can't die from it. You can litter a zombie with bullets and it'll be fine, but destroy its brain and it will die.  The same might also be true with bullets/wounds to WW's vital parts. What I'm getting at is, we literally have no idea the limits of her powers.

> You can't build a movie on ""this person is so badass, look how badass she is all the time.""
