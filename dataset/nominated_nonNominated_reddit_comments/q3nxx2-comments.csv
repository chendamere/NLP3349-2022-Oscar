hfthbg2,"I feel like the Felix Leiter plot could’ve carried an entire movie by itself

-Felix approaches Bond to help the CIA take down Spectre

-Goes to Cuba with extremely capable Bond Girl Paloma

-Felix is betrayed, his partner is working for Spectre, Felix is killed, Bond swears revenge

-Same conclusion of “I had a brother, his name was Felix Leiter”

On a first watch I thought the film was ok, but I just got back from seeing it a second time and enjoyed it a lot more. Any problems I have stem from Malek’s villain and not totally understanding his plan/motivations. Putting that aside though it’s under Casino Royale and Skyfall for me, but I do think it’s an enjoyable film and a good sendoff for Craig’s Bond.",q3nxx2

hftdwhe,"I remember when this film was delayed in March 2020, the first COVID related delay, there was a thread on this sub discussing it. One Redditor said they probably delayed it because the plot might involve a bioweapon, and it might be in bad taste with COVID starting to ramp up. That’s probably not the biggest reason why it was delayed, but whoever you are, you called it on that plot point.",q3nxx2

hft60np,"This didn't blow me away like Casino Royale or Skyfall did/do, but it's a very fitting end.

I figured he was going to be killed off, but it actually got me more emotional than I thought it would. It really hit me when the missile silo doors started closing, like ""Oh, fuck, this is really it.""

My biggest problem is the pacing. We do go from cool set piece to cool set piece, but a lot of the actual plot I didn't find terribly interesting besides Madeline and Safin's relationship.

Still, this is as good as I expected it to be. Cool action, emotionally charged acting, some interesting visuals, Ana de Armas looking insanely attractive and kicking ass while doing it, and Craig getting the send-off he deserves.

If I had to rank it after one viewing, I would put it dead center: Casino Royale, Skyfall, No Time to Die, Spectre, Quantum of Solace.

Thank you, Daniel. It's been an amazing 15 years.",q3nxx2
hfyjpxu,"So, in Danny Boyle's first draft of the script, Malek was definitely Dr. No, right? The island, the ethnic ambiguity, the mask inspired by Japanese Noh. A henchman even refers to him as ""Doctor"" when nowhere to my recollection is it otherwise specified that he's a doctor.",q3nxx2

Though Bond will probably evolve and go on, a small part of my childhood died that day.

hfudgjw,"Exactly what was Safin's motivation for wanting to basically commit genocide? I understood why he wanted to kill Spectre but after the entire Spectre crew died, I couldn't make out why he still wanted to kill so much of the world population? 

It seemed like a very generic evil bad guy motivation masked by eloquent speeches but I don't feel like that was really or properly explained.",q3nxx2
hfwso2j,"The first shot of Ana De Armas’s back when she’s at the bar illicited a vocal reaction from my theater. 

I still have no idea how Blofeld did any of the things he did and I have no idea what Rami Maleck’s plan was. I also don’t understand the nano tech and why they live forever in a persons bloodstream without some kind of energy source. 

I really legitimately was taken off guard that they actually killed Bond. I loved the Santiago action sequence and the opening car chase and the stairway fight near the end. Performances were solid all around (the little girl was great!) and it was a terrific send off for Craig. 

Overall I didn’t find it any more convoluted than any other bond film, but overly long and lacking an interesting villain.",q3nxx2

hftvri6,"My views on this movie might be biased because for my whole life effectively, Daniel Craig has been 'my' Bond.
As much as you can say that subjectively this film is weak compared to Skyfall and not as tight as Casino Royale, this just might be my favourite of this Bond era.
So so much was gotten right, the skyfall-esque fan service, the callbacks to Timothy Dalton's era, and the action sequences were all top notch.
As controversial as I'm sure the ending will be I loved it, it's a perfect bookend to this era and was in my eyes the only way to end this soft reboot. This was always an emotional take on the character right from when he fell for Vesper 16 years ago. This movie provided total closure, and the ending to fade out with All the time in the world made me feel emotions I didn't expect from a bond film. The action was sublime and Paloma has a lot of potential going forward, definitely one of my favourite characters from the last 5.
Also what a well shot movie, right from the start every frame is well thought out and engaging, and we got the awesome one take I was hoping for from Fukunaga.
Overall despite a villain obviously edited to death (I guess because of the implications of a villain launching a plague during a pandemic) I loved the film, epic sendoff",q3nxx2

1. LOVED the bit where he threw the badge into the trash. A reference to the [hat throw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--AO5WHJzgI) James did in so many Bond movies.

2. Single-take stair fight was fire.

3. Kinda disappointing that they didn't really do much with the scopolamine plant

4. What the heck was the point of the stealth glider/sub? They flew it in way too close. Also, why did the base not have cameras in one of their main points of ingress

5. The whole ""nanobots are forever"" thing was rather convoluted. Kind of just a bit of magic that they could hand-wave with some technobabble

6. I was so glad when he gave Q the USB stick and Q decided to airgap it. I was thinking ""have you not already learned your lesson?""

7. Loved how the vast majority of the trailer content came from the opening act.

8. Still not sure how Blofeld controlled anything from prison.

9. What was the book M read from at the end? Was that a line straight from a JB book? Edit: [kind of](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/no-time-to-die-quote-end-film-bond-tribute-b1932576.html)",q3nxx2

hft991o,I think it's really interesting how this movie was all about letting go and moving on but also felt like the most classic of Craig's Bond movies.

hfw8f9g,"The combination of Bond and Felix's deaths was enough to break me. They were my favorite characters in this version of Bond. Felix's line about them living a good life was fantastic. Him and Bond really were brothers by the end. As someone who grew up watching the Craig Bond movies and loved all of them, I couldn't help but break down and cry once I got home. This has never happened to me before despite all the different movies I've seen growing up. For some reason, most movies don't really get me emotional. I think in this case it might've been a combination of nostalgia and attachment to the character. Looking at all 5 movies, I don't give a shit about the flaws in these movies. They're so much more interconnected than any of the previous Bonds that it makes me appreciate it as one giant story. Daniel Craig did a fantastic job and will always be my favorite Bond just based on his character development. I know people were gushing about other things in this movie but I just wanted to see my favorite secret agent get a good sendoff and he did in my opinion. Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to go cry some more.",q3nxx2
hh2m75o,"Two things I haven't seen mentioned:  

Eilish's title theme absolutely *banged* in the theater. Big fan of it.

hftfczn,Ana De Armas was absolutely delightful!,q3nxx2
hfyf45k,"One callback that I liked but haven’t seen mentioned much is Bond’s “my Russian is a little rusty” at the end, clearly a reference to the Cold War influence in most of the older movies that hasn’t been a part of Craig’s movies.

And all I could think of when Bond kept getting hit by grenade blasts was Archer and tinnitus.",q3nxx2
hft2z25,Saw it in IMAX. Sure seemed like they used Michael Mann’s sound designer. The bullets were really percussive.,q3nxx2
hft137r,"I’m going to miss Craig. To many of us he was our first Bond and our gateway drug to the older movies. I’m so so happy they game him a good sendoff.

Older Bond fans, what do we do now?",q3nxx2
hft8db3,"As flawed as (big) aspects of this movie are, I walked away mostly satisfied. The biggest surprise for me was just how intelligently they connected the previous Craig Bond movies into a narrative whole considering how disparate they are, like how Felix Leiter's cynicism towards authority and the Intelligence community re-emerges as a major thematic element of the entire movie, and how Spectre is far more lethal and imposing than their actual full movie.

But more than anything, the unifying theme of the Craig era is how he's becoming a sort of King Midas of death, a figure who only leads to death and ruin to all those around him––something M, Green, Silva, and Blofeld all have said about him... so turning this into a literal plot device, where him ""touching"" the woman he loved would kill her... actually makes tremendous thematic and dramatic sense. That's not to say it was totally earned, everything involving Malek and Safir is pretty bad, but I like the idea.

I love the idea that Safir's doing more damage to Spectre than Bond could in five movies, especially given Skyfall and Spectre's themes of oversight and ""knowing when to pull the trigger,"" so it's a shame his plan becomes unintelligible nonsense about free will and tidiness while selling the nanobot virus to the highest bidder.. not to mention his inexplicable obsession with Swan. I do wish Safir's idea of ""I saved your life and now you belong to me"" was explicitly connected to Bond and MI6. It would make the tragedy of his martyrdom all the more poignant, but I still love the idea of Bond going out cleaning up MI6s mess after four movies of them undermining and turning against him. There's pathos there.

Considering Fukunaga apparently was writing, rewriting and making up some of the action as he went along due to the short turnaround time with the release date, this is a solid, gorgeously directed and exciting Bond movie that's also fairly messy and flawed. The opening hour is near-perfect for me, and a lot of the rest resonates. That's more than enough for me for now.

Oh, and Craig might've given the performance of his career. He's playing a more vulnerable, human and bare Bond than we've ever seen him, ""with no armor left,"" yet still so effortlessly *cool*. You can feel how much he loves Bond.  


EDIT: Thanks for the gold!",q3nxx2
hftzhx7,The transition into the title sequence was absolutely gorgeous. The slow mo on the train as the song comes in. Loved it.,q3nxx2
hgb5j5z,I just didn't think that Safin was the villian that deserved to end James Bond. The character development wasn't enough for this. He was so one dimensional. We don't understand his motivations.  Such a cheap way for Bond to out after surviving almost impossible odds all these years.,q3nxx2
hftv74e,I hope Q’s dinner date with his boyfriend went well.,q3nxx2
hft35rm,"Rami Malek’s character is probably the weakest part of the movie, but it surprisingly didn’t drag it down too much for me. 

Also enjoyed Lashana Lynch’s character a lot more than I expected, I’d watch a spin off.

Bond wrecking the henchman in the woods rocked. One of the more fun scenes I’ve seen this year.

Great send off for Craig.",q3nxx2
hg5t8cb,"It was a great movie with so many callbacks. The entire island in the final act is basically what Dr No’s fortress on Crab Key looks like in my imagination. 

The Felix plot really hurt, because I loved Wright’s version. I had a feeling it was coming just from the Caribbean vibe, though. Let’s face it, Felix has some damned bad luck in the Caribbean. 

I’m glad we got one more scene with Waltz as Blofeld because Oh My God is he so good in that role. 

Ana de Armas was cool, but she didn’t really bring THAT much to the Cuba scene.

Ben Whitshaw remains a wonderful Q and I still have a deep and abiding attraction to Naomi Harris as Moneypenny (and also just in general).

The gunfights were beautifully choreographed. ESPECIALLY the turn and shoot before he heads up the stairs to the control room the first time.

And then there’s that other thing…

Because the Daniel Craig movies were an actual interconnected story arc and not just the same guy going on adventures, I know there is no other way that it could have gone. I mean… it’s not like he could have had a happily ever after. In my heart, I know that. 

But holy shit. Like… holy actual shit.

Also, double holy shit… imagine having to keep that a secret for the year that the movie has been finished and ready for audiences.

EDIT: It was a super small detail, but I fucking loved the past M portraits in that one scene where they were chatting in a hallway.",q3nxx2
hftoqt7,"After Albert R. Broccoli died, Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson publicly alternated leading the production of the modern (GoldenEye on) Bond films.

I’ve theorized that every odd-numbered Bond since (GoldenEye, World is Not Enough minus Denise Richards, Casino Royale, Skyfall, and now No Time To Die) has been excellent, while the even numbered Bonds (Tomorrow Never Dies minus Jonathan Pryce, Die Another Day, Quantum of Solace and Spectre) were subpar.

This was a phenomenal movie, and I’m glad that Daniel Craig had the opportunity to end his run on a high note. However, given that track record, I’m reeeeeeally wary about the next Bond film to come.

- That scene where Bond was ascending the stairs shooting everyone on the island at the end was extremely well done, very intense and no cuts that I can remember?

- The ending was also very well done and quite emotional for me, I was crying sitting beside my dad lol

- I thought Rami Malek was pretty good but not given enough screen time and his motivations were a little hard to pin down 

- Overall definitely one of Craig’s best ones and I like that all five of his are kind of connected and make for a series of films that average out to be very good 

- I wonder how they will handle the next Bond. Will they have the same M, Q, and Moneypenny? How will they explain a new Bond?",q3nxx2

Everything up to Blofeld's death I loved.  The Cuba sequence was worth the price of entry on its own.   The dynamic between bond and the new 007 was fun.  Felix's death was impactful,  and I appreciated the parallels to Vesper's. 

The third act, though, I found terribly dull.  I think that's more to blame on Spectre's failings than this movie itself.   I just don't believe Bond and Madelines love story,  and the whole second half hinges on that.

Also, not that it's really that important,  but James Bond would most definitely  have had a vasectomy.",q3nxx2

hxkniqk,"Thinking back about the movie, While listening to the theme song, I find myself torn about what to think of it. It’s a frustrating movie in a way : there is a good story in the movie. They just added a lot of BS.  

You have the pure horseshit : 
You have a villain who barely appears with a BS past and a BS plan. You have a Nanobot smart virus plan which is the epitome of science meets dumbass screenwriter talking out of his ass. You have a stupidly contrived plot by blofeld that gets hijacked and make things even more complicate. A Casino Royale was stylishly simple and that made him so good. NTTD on the other hand has the same type of overwritten half-baked plot already experienced in Spectre and other modern blockbusters. Full of shitty secret pasts and magic technology  and brain dead twists that seem supposed to make things awesome.

And then you have the core story of James Bond. James Bond, the orphaned loner, who’s truely happy at last but again end up having a trust issue with a woman he loved. And as a result falls back in the old patterns but feels even more empty. Who is aging and still can go through the motions but is starting to get mocked for his age and  more importantly now constantly feel/look bored of everything, the action, the women : been there, done that.  But then is truely taken by surprise  : he finds himself to be a father for the first time ( in and out universe : first time on  screen) and finds meaning/ a place where he truely wants to be. But after briefly experiencing  this paradise, it’s taken away from him and he ultimately understands that he won’t get to experience that  for long and will have to die to protect it. And that’s alright in a bittersweet way : because his work was done and  he loved/knew he was loved without the constant doubt that plagued his entire  life.There was meaning in that death.


Specifically I think the final shot at MI6 resumes the essence of what was good about the movie : you have Mallory the new M, The new 007, Moneypenny, Q.  Judi Dench is dead, Felix is dead, Mathis is dead,. There’s no one left  of  the first movie. That’s how it works : Every generation has his tales of fight and love -  Felix M Matis all felt overall alright about their death. They lived the life. Felix straightup says it was a good life. James Bond was the only one left standing, one way or another the clock was ticking. And when everything that had to be said has been said,   the new generation pays hommage and takes the place of the old one.

Truely it was time to die.",q3nxx2
i02mc9p,"I had no idea that Bond died. I managed to avoid spoilers this entire time. Just rented the film today.

They were leading up to it but was still so damn shocked. I loved Craig as Bond and growing up with these films, seeing Bond have a more grounded emotional personality is my favorite.",q3nxx2
hfszv0n,"""I had a brother. His name was Felix Leiter."" Chills. 

It's not perfect, but I'm damn happy with this. Happy that it's a good movie, for Craig's run as Bond to go out with a bang, and to have seen how the Bond movies evolved over the last fifteen years. What an exciting time to be a fan. 

I will say that Malek isn't the most compelling villain. He's a little paint by numbers are far as Bond villains go. His connection to Swan is the most interesting thing about him, but his general motivations, plans, and traits are pretty classic Bond. His role in the movie is perfectly serviceable to get us to what's most impressive about this movie and that's how human and emotional it is. 

Craig Bond has always stood out by being more raw than other Bonds, so this seems a fitting end. His movies also have way more continuity than any other Bond so I'm glad they stuck to that even after the middling critical reception of Spectre. I think Lea Seydoux is probably one of the best Bond actresses and giving her a big role in these last two movies was a big brain move and payed off really well in this movie. 

As far as the action, the lair, the Bondness of it, it's a perfectly good Bond movie. But it's the emotion and acting and finality of it that make it unique and make it stand out from pretty much any other Bond movie. I think it's a great way to wrap up a Bond actor. We are so far past winking at the camera and saying ""the other guy never had to deal with this"" or joking about actor changes. So this felt like the right way. We saw his beginning as a 00, now we get to see the end. 

I think I'd rank Craig's movies with Casino Royale in first place, then this, then Skyfall, SPECTRE, and QoS. And honestly it might be my JB hype at an all time high, but I rewatched them all this week and SPECTRE was definitely better than I remembered. Overall, this was an easy 8/10. It's a bit long and is very reminiscent of classic Bond, but I've never cried so hard in a Bond movie.",q3nxx2

They just need to realize that At some level the character is the character and that’s the only reason we come back. Bond is a mans man.

We had 4 bond movies with Craig just beastmoding and super sleek action packed - and they absolutely should have been.  And while this one had great action , any good character arc needs a major growth or some type of profound effect on the character.  I haven't watched the older bonds that much so I dunno what they have and haven't done before that well.  But speaking only for Daniel Craig's Bond Storyline - James Bond is a daddy, and while we know he has loved before this one was like ""the one"", mother of his child.  And I really liked that unchartered territory for a character like this.  And of course, him dying at the end is totally shitty, but it also keeps the myth and legend alive -. He never got to be a homebody with wife and picket fence.  He became a daddy, all to brief and then fuckin died saving the world.   A really great tragedy type of ending .  Even had he survived he could never hold his daughter again, or kiss the woman he loved.   Cmon now.  Plot holes and shit aside, every movie will have those - but a good character with a great story that was a ton of fun for 5 movies.  Enjoy the show , thought it was great",q3nxx2
ibxbmqb,"Just watched the movie and I really loved it as the end of the Daniel Craig arc. The character development is an asset which no other Bond movie sequence could realize. Just amazing how he experiences love, loss, betrayal, love again but with trust issues and then finally fatherhood and sacrifice. All while being the womanizing (in appropriate measures), alcoholic and invincible action hero we know and love. M (both), Monneypenny, Q, Vesper, Mathis, Felix, etc. have been awesomly played and greatly written. 
The villains in Craigs movies compared to the older ones are completely in a different league. LeChiffre, Blofeld and Raoul Silva were amazing, period. 

I will probably remember Craig as the actor that gave  007 a new dimension and gravity.

With that being said, the directing was top notch( hats off to Cary Fukunaga) and the Cuba scenes and the stairwell scenes were really incredible and my favorite parts of the film. Ana de Armas had such a brief but fun part as well and Lashana Lynch absolutely held her own. I don’t know if I like having bond this emotionally broken down though. The appeal of bond is that he’s a secret agent and you live vicariously through his smooth drinking, sex and heroics.

I loved that despite Felix being in only the first two movies of Daniel Craig’s reign, you could tell that they had worked together more between movies and developed a strong affection for each other through their dialogue in the club. “I had a brother.” Goosebumps

I loved how Ana de Armas as Paloma absolutely stole every scene she was in. Gorgeous, charming, and a complete and total badass. 

I loved how 007 and Bond formed a professional respect toward each other and that there was no betrayal moment where she revealed she was working for Malek the entire time (seriously thought that was coming until pretty much the end). 

I loved so much about this movie. It’s officially topped Casino Royale as my favorite. 

Rami Malek needed more fleshing out as a villain. Beyond revenge on Spectre we weren’t really told what his motivation was.

He'd already killed Spectre and didn't seem to care about world domination, who were the people he was planning to kill? I tried looking it up but no one else seems to have a clue either. 

Was disappointed by Lynch's character as well, I know she was meant to be more serious than Bond but considering she's a 00 Agent I was expecting her to be a one woman army, killing scores of goons with ease much like Bond does, instead her main role seemed to just be to drive Bond around, vanish before the action starts to do some other job and then tell him about what she did off screen. I think the writers tried too hard to manufacture conflict between her and Bond (which wasn't needed) and forgot to justify why she was a 00 Agent instead of just a normal operative. Ana De Armas' character felt way more like a 00 Agent in the 10 minutes of screen time she had, I'm not sure why the writers couldn't have done the same for Lynch.

Just to fantasy book  the ending: after finishing off SPECTRE (without killing their families), I would have had Safin store the nanoweapon on his island for future use in case a similar threat ever rises. The MI6 and Bond  seek to destroy the weapon, because it is way too powerful for someone like Safin to wield. This would have created a more interesting dynamic since so far Safin has only used the weapon to kill members of a dangerous criminal organization and could be seen as a sort of an antihero. However, he also had a personal vendetta against SPECTRE and might be tempted to use the nanotech in the future for his own purposes, so the MI6 and Bond are totally justified in wanting to make sure he cannot use it again.",q3nxx2

The nanobot thing is just making me irrationally angry. You're literally using a computer to program these nanobots and tell them what to do. They're in essence electronic, but an EMP doesn't affect them. As if that wasn't iffy enough, why couldn't you just program new nanobots to disarm/wipeout the poison ones.

The biggest negative for me was the villain - he almost seemed like a background element and was just phoned in by the writers. A very generic 'nanobot' technology, and no real justification as to why he was trying to wipe out most of the earth's population.

The few minutes Blofeld had on screen completely stole the show away from Malek (to the point that I have forgotten the characters actual name) with a true feeling of tension and interest.
Could we have had this movie with Blofeld as the bad guy instead?

On the other hand, the Madeline storyline was a great way to humanise the killing machine and give some growth to Bond over the Daniel Craig run, and it book ended his time as Bond nicely - and gives the next installment space to return without any baggage (just like with the previous actor changes where there was no real continuity) (I do hope they keep this M/Q/Moneypenny combo though, they work nicely).

hft02pb,"I actually really like the idea of a villain whose goal is the same as Bond's (get revenge on SPECTRE for what they did to him) but the villain just goes too far with it. The moral ambiguity of that could have made for a really interesting showdown. This seemed to be Safin's main goal but once he was able to finish off SPECTRE and (via Madeleine's hands) Blofeld, his motivations switched to the stereotypical Bond villain objective of ""destroy humanity and maybe make some money in the process"", and that's when they lost me.

I recall reading rumours from a long time ago that Safin was going to be a villain so obsessed with Madeleine Swann that he cloned her with the intention of (after destroying humanity) repopulating the Earth with ""her"", and the clone would end up becoming Bond and Madeleine's adopted daughter at the end of the film. I can't believe I'm saying this about a theory that involves actual human cloning in a Bond film, but I almost sort of wish this had been Safin's motivation instead of what we ended up getting because at least this would be *something* that could be explained. Instead we just get a bunch of crap about wanting the world to be tidier.",q3nxx2

They are heavy as we see the car tilt as they get in. 

This seen on Bluray special edition.

I've really only watched the last few Bond movies Spyfall -> NTTD and this was my absolute favorite of the bunch. Yeah, there were flaws (i.e. weak motivation by Safin), but the cinematography, the gravitas, and the pacing all worked for me. There wasn't a dull moment for me in an almost 3 hour movie. I even ended up watching the full credits. It would be sad if they retire the supporting characters along with Bond, but I would understand.

hg2e4j4,"What worked:

 - Really liked Bond's characterization this movie, the perfect version of a tough, serious Bond without being too dark.

- SPECTRE was awesome in this movie and done far better than their own movie. They actually felt like a major threat.

- M (kinda) being behind the bio-weapon was cool and gave M more to do than usual.

- Felix Leiter was great as always. Wish he got more screen time, but his death scene was really good.

- The Aston Martin with machine guns. 'Nuff said

- The presence of Blofeld and SPECTRE looming over Bond for the first hour was great and very ""classic Bond""

- Gadgets are making a comeback!

- Moneypenny and Q sneaking around to help Bond brought a smile to my face. No matter the era, the movie, or the Bond those 2 should always have his back.

- Bond has a few one-liners which is always a staple.

- The new 007 was a pleasant surprise. She didn't trample over Bond or anything like that and was actually very respectful by the end. Nice to see ""diversity"" or whatever done right.

- Bond's death scene was very well done. People will rightfully talk about his conversation with Madelyn but I really liked his somber moment with Q as well.

- I don't know why they brought ""We Have All The Time In The World"" back but I liked it.

What didn't:

- Safin was not good or threating or ...anything. I couldn't even understand what he was saying half the time, especially at the end. I like the idea of someone going after SPECTRE and having a three-way war between SPECTRE, MI6, and Safin but that wasn't explored enough. Also, how did Safin get the resources for an island and 100+ employees. How the hell did he convince former SPECTRE agents to join him?!

- The Ana De Arams scene was cool but it was obvious bait for a spin-off

- Christoph Waltz's Blofeld still doesn't really work for me. His presence looming large over the first hour was great but in person he just seems so...dosile. Then again, I guess Blofeld has always been at his best behind the scenes. Shame MI6 didn't let him keep the cat in prison haha.

- The guy MI6 is hunting having a personal connection to Madelyn seems a little....convenient. 

- I like Madelyn fine but I still don't see what makes her the one Bond falls for.

- Thought the movie was a bit dark at times, made it hard to see in darker scenes.",q3nxx2
hg2htm8,"This movie's ending was shockingly emotional for me. For the first 2.5 hours, it was a solid spy/action thriller with some obvious flaws and silliness, as others have mentioned.

The Craig/Bond series, when looked at in its entirety, basically amounts to torture porn of this beloved character. And, to be clear, the pain and suffering he faces in the previous films all largely made sense within the context of the individual film. To have this character, who has suffered immense heartbreak and betrayal and loss be \*this\* close to finally achieving happiness only for it to be torn away from him, was honestly very affecting for me.

Perhaps if his death had felt more sacrificial it would have softened the blow somewhat. 

Added thoughts/context: I am one of the movie fans that frequently rolls his eyes at major franchise character deaths knowing there will be no permanence/no actual stakes or consequences. So my feelings on Bond's death here aren't so much me being unable to accept a sad ending as they are just remorse for the emotional torture this iteration of Bond has gone through for so long now.",q3nxx2
hgpyyxf,"OK I have one problem with this movie: Why didn't James Bond die smoking Felix's cigar ? That would have been so cool.

hgy74u3,"Daniel Craig is my favorite Bond.  I'm glad he got a much better send off than Brosnan.

This movie was pretty good, only complaints are that Raimi Malek's character was poorly developed(well acted though) and the new 007 was incredibly uninteresting.   Honestly I think she was only in the movie to create media buzz with the ""is there a black female Bond now?"" question, and IIRC it didn't even generate much controversy. 

Ana De Armas was great.  Hope that we see more of her in the next iteration of Bond.  Which leads me to think they should do a ""soft"" reboot where the supporting cast largely carries over.   I've enjoyed Ralph Fiennes et al.",q3nxx2
hh4cbl9,"I watched it last night and had some time to think on it/sleep on it. Ultimately my opinion is that it is a very average middle of the road ""meh"" bond movie.

I thought Safin was kinda boring. I get his motivation against Spectre, but I didn't understand his motivation against humanity itself. He just wanted to exterminate people to make it more ""tidy""?

The ending was fine I guess. But couldn't Bond leave the island and be ""quarantined"" until they look for some kind of cure? I know Q said it was permanent but I feel like Bond gave up a bit too easily.

The Jamaica/Cuba setting was classic Bond, and I kind of wished they stayed at those locations. Ana De Armas was fantastic and I kinda wish she was in it the whole time with Bond.

I was hoping Safin would be Dr. No, but that was just wishful thinking on my part. Ultimately the acting was great, the pre-title sequence scenes were awesome as well. There were some great action scenes such as the foggy forest Rambo scene. But once the movie moves away from Jamaica and Cuba it kind of falls apart from there story-wise.

For me when the villain in a Bond movie is weak, with a weak motivation, more often than not I'm not going to enjoy the movie as much. Safin was weak as a villain, and I was upset that Blofeld and Spectre were killed off so quickly and easily.",q3nxx2

hkl06d1,"I'm legitimately surprised to the good reception this seems to get. I, fan of the Bond series (and definitely *not* among the ""Bond only got good with Craig) didn't like the conclusion at all.

there were a few good action scenes but pretty much the whole plot didn't work for me at all.

to me it's also a good example of why the constant ""escalation of threats"" doesn't work.

like, in ""Spectre"" it was revealed that Blofeld and his organization were this global, in-the-shadows group that was secretly responsible for the events of the previous films (which imo in itself was a dumb concept).

only for Blofeld and Spectre to be killed off *just like that* in this to establish ""this threat is EVEN WORSE!"". it's basically the ""Jurassic Park 3"" Spinosaurus easily kills the T-Rex scene.

and it's especially annoying that, while the last film's plot was already stupid, it becomes even stupider if it's rendered almost meaningless and unimportant just one movie later.

the idea of the relationship between Bond and Swann also felt forced to me (I feel interestingly that, in the Bond context, Vesper worked particularly *because* she died, not because there was a legitimate chance of them being together. similar to ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"").

and it also had a brief moments that felt puzzling to me. Safin letting Mathilde go being the biggest one. it really felt like the creators knew they needed to get her to safety. but didn't bother with a good way to accomplish it.",q3nxx2
hzrj174,"I thought it was great. Really well shot, visually looked fantastic, very well deserved sound mixing Oscar nomination too. The plot was good and had some nice turns. I haven't seen Spectre but didn't feel like I was missing anything, it did a great job of setting it all up in the first act. 

It did feel very Dark Knight-y at times haha, like with the Blofeld scene and the general vibe. Plus they reused part of the Dark Knight score when Bond introduces Madeline and his daughter to the new agent. But that's never a bad thing in my books hahaha",q3nxx2
hft193k,"I enjoyed that. Not as good as Casino or Skyfall, but definitely better than Quantum and Spectre. Craig was awesome and Rami played a good, if slightly underutilized, villain. Action scenes were great and the cinematography was beautiful. I do find it funny how Craig, arguably the most physical Bond, only had a single physical villain to have a fight scene with and it was Greene, of all of them.

The ending, however, fascinates me. Are they going to use Casino through No Time as a definitive starting point of a new continuity where they use the concept of every new 007 also inheriting the name James Bond in honor of Craig? Are they going to treat all Bonds as their own continuity where they can tell 3-5 movie arcs for each new Bond?

There's a lot of possibilities there.",q3nxx2

I thought each character did their part in the story and served the story justice, but I agree that Felix was a bit underused. That's my biggest con if I had to pick one.

On a side note, I remember when Casino Royale came out and people said it was great. Quantum of Solace was trashed on when it came out. Then Skyfall came out and people said it was better than Casino Royale, a lot saying it was the best James Bond movie ever. Then Spectre was all mixed reviews and people sort of forgot about Skyfall and went back to Casino Royale as the best Craig one. Now this one comes out and it's gonna be interesting what people say.",q3nxx2
hhyelta,"Did anyone else find it odd that the new 007 had way less action to do than Ana de Armas? Honestly after watching I would prefer her to be the next 007 if there has to be one, she was badass.

I hated the villain (extremely boring, no compelling backstory) and thought a lot of fat could have been trimmed, it was quite overlong in parts. But it did have some very cool action scenes and I had to fight back tears at the end, didn't think they'd actually go through with it.

I was confused at why Nomi  got nothing to do while Ana de Armas kicked so much ass, would have thought they'd switch those roles around if she was built up to be the next 007.

I loved that they embraced some of the cheesy bond stuff like the car machine guns and even gave Craig an after-kill pun with ""I showed someone your watch Q, it really blew their mind!"" That line felt like a Brosnan-era quip.

If I had to rank the Craig Bonds, it would be:

1 Casino Royale

2 Skyfall

3 No Time To Die

4 Spectre

5 Quantum of Solace",q3nxx2

I feel like Craig has gone full Harrison Ford and agreed to the film only if they killed his character off.

hftd9ud,"I thought Daniel Craig was very good, but each of these movies could have been better as standalones. I was watching a review of the movies to prepare and it boiled down to ""First, there was a secret bad guy. After he was defeated, we found there was a secret bad guy's secret boss. then there was THAT secret bad guy's secret bad guy's boss. Then this time we found the biggest baddest guy of all!""

It helped give a reason of why Bond's love interest was relevant, but that still felt like they were shoehorning a few bad dudes being creepily into her to feel like a connection.

Additionally, the villain's goals got increasingly vague as they went on. First guy wants money- cool, makes sense. Then they just want super secret back door power. Uh, I guess. Then finally this bad guy wants to kill everybody just because he thinks all humans secretly have a death wish.

As a random aside, Rami Malek being into the love interest because he saved her life once for some reason made me think of Twilight's whole thing about ""imprinting"" on people and being connected and it made me giggle.",q3nxx2

hhoa27v,"I enjoyed it. Yes you can drive an Aston Martin through the plot (just how many DB5’s does Bond own?) but that’s true of any Bond film. To me it was a great way to finish Craig’s tenure, with plenty of quick nods to the series’ history without banging them on your head (see Skyfall).

I think they could have dropped the CIA element easily and spent to time on developing the female characters which all seemed too underdeveloped. The less said about the baddie the better, good performance but simply a poor character badly explained.

I’d put it at number two of Craig’s films behind Casino Royale and look forward to what they intend to do next. But really i just want them to start setting Bond in the 60s. The character is just silly in any other time and the period setting would allow them to lean into it more.

I personally think Casino Royale is a better movie but this is an easy second favourite for me. >!It really a good ending for this version of the character!<. Rami Malek's character was probably the weaker part of the movie,
>!we could have had more of his character in the movie, perhaps he could have been in the Cuba scene lurking in the background!<. (which is a minor problem for me )

I genuinely don't know how they can really top the Craig era after this. Perhaps it would be better to wait for sometime to figure out the next steps for the franchise.

Also, a fun point >!if your favourite character has a daughter/daughter like figure, they are screwed. Iron  Man, Wolverine and Bond come to mind. There could be more examples but these are the ones I can think of at the moment!<

hmd50yx,"I have mixed feelings about this one! On the one hand, they made a lot of bold choices and he also had a lot of great one-liners, which is something that hasn't been true of Daniel Craig Bond up until this point. However, this might have the weakest villain with the strangest motivations of all of them and that's where the movie kind of unravels for me. 

Spectre was built up to be looming over Bond from the beginning, and it was being managed through prison so it was 100% still a threat. Then the ""villain"" of the movie kills them all. So that's.... good, right? I genuinely don't understand why he does any of the following things afterwards: 

1. Having his agent kill Felix and blow up the ship with Bond in it. What did they do to him? 
2. Kidnap Madeleine and her daughter. Why? 
3. Have a plan to infect millions of people with this virus. Why? 
4. Let Bond's daughter go when she bites his finger. Why? 
5. Poison Bond and himself with a targeted version of the virus that will specifically only kill Madeleine and her daughter. WHY!?!?!!!?!?

Something was just missing here. The first half of this movie introduces an interesting character who wants to get revenge on everyone involved with Spectre and does so very effectively, intentionally keeping Bond alive in the process! And then he almost immediately does an about face and decides Bond needs to be tormented. 

If it's jealousy over Bond and Madeleine being in love, then why not kill Bond along with everyone in Spectre? And if he isn't jealous, then why the obsession with the Bond family afterwards? 

It's a shame because it seems like the Bond villains in Daniel Craig's movies have just gotten weaker with time. Casino Royale is about a hedge fund manager for terrorists who loses their money and has to make it up. That's cool and is also something you can wrap your head around. Silva's probably going to go down as the favorite villain from this era, very well-acted and his motivation was purely to punish M for betraying/abandoning him. That was great! 

But the last two were just like...huh?!?!? James Bond had a step-brother he never told anyone about who passionately hated him so much he built a massive organization to cause him constant heartbreak? And then in this movie that entire organization is demolished by one man who just kinda wants to kill everyone with a nanovirus. 

So yeah, that kind of detracted from an otherwise beautiful send off. I would've loved this movie otherwise, their final goodbye, saving I love you, and then Bond getting blasted apart to ensure he never spreads his virus to them. Damn, that's sad! But I just was so confused and distracted by why any of this was necessary.",q3nxx2
hpiyl6b,"I feel like this was a great ending because it was bittersweet but also very much cathartic in a way that he was able to let go of all the past traumas he has dealt with from the previous films in the series. After saving the world one last time, embracing a fiery explosion is a pretty badass way to die.

However, there could have been a better ending. I'm a hopeless romantic, so I would have loved seeing him being able just settle down with Madeleine and Mathilde.

The main antagonist played by Rami Malek was honestly a huge letdown because his motives were pretty much nonexistent other than doing things out of spite and revenge. It just seemed like they used him as an excuse to kill off Bond which is my only real problem with the ending.

Dude was pretty much about to board his boat way before Bond could open the missile gates, but for some reason, he came back to kill Bond and himself. Pointless in the perspective of the film, but in the perspective of Craig, he was probably on board with it and just wanted to end off on some sort of bang after doing the character for 15 years.

hg79zxe,"Overall, I liked it, and interestingly, it did not feel like the runtime was long whatsoever. However, there were some major problems:

1. Everything starts and ends at Craig leaving, and them wanting to tie up loose ends. There were simply too many plot points.
2. Blofeld and the entire Spectre organization were destroyed with little fanfare. Which resulted in little impact. Honestly don't think they should have included Spectre period.
3. Because of all these elements, we barely saw the main villain. Safin shared two scenes with Bond, and his motivation was essentially just quick exposition of ""Spectre killed his family, so he wants revenge"". Why is he at the disputed island, why does he want to unleash a global massacre, why is he wearing a haori and sitting on tatami? How did he build his network, his wealth to the point it rivals Spectre? 

I feel like in order to include everything, they diluted everything, especially the main villain. That's a pity, because I really do think there's a good Bond film in there if you look past everything.",q3nxx2

hgih7nr,Here’s what I don’t understand. Safin tracks down and finds Mr. whites family like 10 years before the movie starts and kills the wife and is extremely motivated in finding Mr. white and making him pay. But after killing his wife and saving his daughter he just suddenly doesn’t care anymore? Like he had years and years of time and he never was able to find Mr. white? Even when he has considerable resources at a certain point and Mr. white is dying in a very unsecure house. It makes no sense to me,q3nxx2

I thought it was a bit mission impossible while watching it, but it’s actually a decent film after some reflection.

Memorable ending.

Cinematography was cold and interesting. Loved the misty forest but then it was clear just afterwards.

Spoilers:
Poor Madeline and Mathilde will be so scarred. I’m sad Bond didn’t get his happy ending. And that Mathilde didn’t get her Dou Dou back with her father.

Anyone who has watched all the Bond films know maybe it’s action, romance, camp, plot holes. Rami Malek acted well: just didn’t get a hugely fleshed out story. Seemed he also loved Madeline, or were connected through her father. Why didn’t we find out who he was? Blofeld was teased, as was Craig not as father.

Madeline said “she’s not yours” not you are not the father. It was meant to throw us off before she felt trust with love. 

Well done. Of course Bond has plot holes, they all do. Bye Daniel Craig. You are my 4th Bond and you’ve grown on me through your evolution to caring about people.",q3nxx2

A) What's a life worth living if you cant be with your loved ones. I cant believe for the first time Bond dies at the end of his movie. Not sure im over thinking but MGM studios sales, plus the Amazon acquisition of MGM, this ending feels a little poetic in its the end of 25 movies worth of A James Bond.

B) I'm really intrigued to see if they do an entire reboot? They did say James Bond will return at the end of the credits

C) i really liked the CIA female agent (3 weeks on training) - She was soooo  bad ass. Loved her initial / dyanmic with Bond

D) Damn i cant believe they killed Felix like that.

E) Bond finally takes down Spectre AND i loved how he kills Blofeld

F) Director did a fantastic job.

G) Loved the beginning when he puts her on the train and says she'll never see him again, she touches her stomach and i flag was planted in the back of my mind

H) The Cyclops fatality was amazing.

I) I loved that the tandem of Q, Moneypenny and Bond come together for this Mission

J) Minor Nit to Pick - How did they know where Leyscifer secret base in dipsute waters between Russia and Japan was located?

K) That dooshey guy who betrayed Felix got killed in the best way!",q3nxx2

Biggest issue was the villain, Rami's acting was fine but his character made no sense. This is definitely the best action out of any Bond movie. The best scenes were the spectre party, the Italy opening, and the stairwell fight near the end. Visual effects and cinematography were top tier.

 8/10 definitely recommend, probably the ""blockbuster/popcorn"" movie of the year",q3nxx2

I didn't mind a female bond, but I didnt like that they casted a terribly not-charismatic person to play her. Totally didn't fit the theme of Bond movies..",q3nxx2
hm8xahq,"As much as the ""James Bond is dead"" ending shocked me, it does fit with the theme of things in this movie taken from the You Only Live Twice novel.  Ian Fleming intended for Bond to be dead at the end of that book, then retroactively had him survive with amnesia at the beginning of The Man with the Golden Gun. Even the little eulogy M gave in this film was taken almost verbatim from the YOLT novel.
  
This could be something similar, like the ""death"" we saw wasn't what actually happened, but a representation of the story that MI6 put out to make it seem like Bond is really dead (especially to his new family, whom he can never see again because of his ""poison"".)  So maybe the next film won't be totally brand new and ""let's ignore the end of No Time to Die and start with a clean slate""; maybe there will be some reference to it being a fake story to cover his identity.",q3nxx2
hfszz8b,"Maybe I'm giving the writers too much credit (half the writing team did give us Die Another Day, after all) but I appreciate what they were trying to go for with the ending of this film. There is something very tragic about this particular iteration of James Bond (who has never had a family, and who has time and time again lost the people he loves) finally being able to save two people he can call his family - but having to sacrifice his own life in order to do so.

I like this idea on paper, but I honestly don't think it was executed as well as it could have been in the film itself. Part of the problem is that despite the script insisting that the Bond/Madeleine relationship is some sort of epic love story for the ages, Craig and Seydoux continue to have virtually no chemistry - and no amount of impassioned ""I have always loved you"" speeches can force it. Craig has more chemistry and spark with Ana de Armas in that brief Cuba sequence than he does with Seydoux across two freaking films!",q3nxx2

But tied the vesper stuff and spectre nicely, and was interesting to see a bad guy who wanted revenge on the main bad organization in the whole series, got it, then kept going. The nano bots seemed like a hand wave but this is a movie series that historically has had way way more made up devices. ‘Member the death laser in goldfinger? So it was fun. Killing off Bond seemed right, and I enjoyed the “we have all the time in the world” nods to OHMSS. I liked that it wasn’t some big huge bad guy who killed him off. 
Really, he killed himself off, he could’ve gotten out and just cast Madeleine and his daughter aside, or maybe they could’ve invented a cure. 

In some ways this felt like two movies though. In an ideal scenario part 1 would’ve introduced Madeleine and Bond finally coming to terms with the loss of Vesper and part 2 would’ve been safin vs bond and the death. Also, what the fuck are they going to do now? Full reboot? Reboot but bring back M like they did last time? Ralph gave a decent performance but there was one scene when Bond was confronting him about the weapon where he felt VERY Voldemort-ish.

Poison the world or something but...why? Taking the daughter and then...not taking the daughter? Has some weird crush on Madeline despite only meeting her once when she was like 8 years old? The movie already ended and I was still not sure who the fuck this guy was. A bit underwhelming to be Daniel Craig's last bad guy and the only bad guy yet to take down a Bond. Feels like this movie could have been a two parter that were 2 hours long instead but I'm sure Craig would have none of it lol 

Also kinda dumb how the agency that has the technology for things like ""smart blood"" and ultra emp watches didn't bother scanning Blofeld for a bionic fucking eye that had wifi. 

It was a nice send off for Daniel Craig's Bond. Hopefully the next series of Bond lets the movie have a bit more ""fun"" though. Kinda getting exhausted with the ""dark and gritty"" obsession Hollywood has had for the last decade or so since the TDK trilogy.

My only real letdown is the ending - I really was hoping Bond would make it because the guy's been through so much. However, that's what I love about this era: Bond is not a superhero and he doesn't save everybody he cares about through all the movies. It's fitting here that he's able to come through for the two people he cares about the most, but paying the ultimate cost for it.

By the end you can tell Bond was worn down both physically and mentally as this was something apparent going back a few movies. The old Bond from Casino Royale definitely would have been able to rescue Felix after making short work of Ash. This movie's Bond definitely could not have finished that very first free-running foot chase we saw him in Casino Royale.

I mean, by the end of this movie the guy could barely stand which gives us the sense that he absolutely gave everything and that's why I think it's a great send-off.

I found that whole scene really jarring and almost like a parody. The acting was fine but the concept was just ridiculous. I mean, he was there 5 mins and he already spotted a guy who tried to kill him a few days earlier (and who somehow was able to find him when he was off the grid). He just strolls around the party and expects noone to recognise him. Then Blofield fimgers him (big shock) and tries to kill him but....ends up killing ALL spectre agents. Just like that, gone.

* Firstly, the fact that this movie was so delayed definitely impacted the film: when Bond met the new 007 I could have sworn that they had already met and was confused by the interaction but it's just that it's been YEARS since that first trailer so it feels like another movie ago. Not to mention it had been 6 years since the last movie I think so I had next to no memory of what had happened and had to refresh myself. To that point, the movie perhaps didn't quite stand on its own enough

* The bad guy's motivations were dubious at best. Her father killed your family? Got it, you want to kill them. Specter was the organization behind it? Got it, you want to kill them. But I have no clue how he got from that point to ""infect the whole world and control them somehow even though it's not clarified why you are doing this or even how you would be able to suddenly turn on the nanobots while having them also dormant so that there are actually people to control"". Just seemed like generic 'im bad because im bad' villain.

* The people in my theater were NOT happy that they killed Bond off. I myself am confused as to why he doesn't wear a bullet proof vest, but otherwise it felt like this version of bond was a tale of a deeply tragic and flawed figure and his sacrifice was both poignant and also telling of how empty his life felt and would feel without his family. The others in the theater felt the opposite and that the 007 movies were not supposed to be so dark. 

* ONE of the people in the theater kept going on about how it was forcing out the 'white male' protagonist to make way with the new woke 007 which I think is nonsense because likely the new iteration will reboot the franchise and carry over next to none of the characters. I do think it's a delicate line to tow because on one hand, the character should demonstrate the times while also moving away from some unsavory tropes of movies/books made 50+ years ago but on the other hand at a certain point if you change so much just make a different movie and stop trying to milk the IP. 

I have to rewatch some of the movies that I don't remember so much (mostly Spectre) but overall it didn't feel its runtime and was an enjoyable ride/conclusion to the Craig saga (even if again some of the main plot points weren't really concise",q3nxx2

hgy9v4a,"I enjoyed it, but I feel like they didn't adequately explain anything about the villain beyond that his family was killed by Mr. White on the orders of Blofeld or however you spell it. I still don't understand how he had the means to establish Generic Bad Guy Private Island Full of Goons and Equipped with a Doomsday Weapon #7744, or why he wanted to kill whatever arbitrary amount of people showed up on that laptop Bond was looking at. 

I feel like it would have been relatively easy to say that Malek's group was a splinter from Spectre hence the resources, and that the people he was targeting were the entire families of the Spectre members to the 12th degree of separation or something like that. Instead they just didn't bother for some reason.",q3nxx2

hg1dtlm,"I honestly don't know if I liked it or not, I'm gonna need some more time on that. But at the same time, I can appreciate what it was and what it tried to do. Compared to something like The Rise of Skywalker that just went ""duhhh I don't know how to write sequel to movie I didn't like"" and gave up, I thought No Time To Die made a valiant effort at picking up the pieces after Spectre and trying to make the most of it.

There was some fun action, particularly with Ana de Armas's character and around the finale, and more than a few scenes that were downright unsettling. I swear parts of this were shot like a horror movie, and they were surprisingly effective. The leadup to meeting Blofeld in prison genuinely made him feel like more of a threat than anything that happened in Spectre. Safin's motivation wasn't the most solid premise, but Rami Malek gave him a really great presence whenever he was on screen.

Ultimately though I feel like No Time To Die was harmed by Craig's Bond going from a new 00 in Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace to old and washed up in the very next movie. As much as I enjoyed Skyfall, I feel like we never got to see this Bond in his prime. No Time To Die asks for a *lot* of investment in his character, but I feel like I don't know him outside of ""well, he's James Bond."" I feel like that sort of thing *could* work, but I just wasn't ready for it this time around.

Not my favorite Bond film, but again, I liked that it was ambitious. Glad they didn't just play it safe. It gives me at least a little hope that they've got what it takes to make a solid reboot in the future.",q3nxx2

The villain sucked and I can't believe he's the one to finish off James Bond. His plan sucked, no great motives and just not interesting. 

I was hoping for something big at the end, but I was disappointed. Now I'm not a big JB fan, but I like some movies, especially Casino Royale, and i felt this movie quite weak and too long. Though the ending for James was a good send-off, just wish it was a bigger threat than Malik (which I like as an actor, but the character here sucked).

hkkd6jc,"I feel like they missed an opportunity with this one. Both Bond and Safin hate spectre. A retired Bond goes off the reservation with a gray area Safin to take out the bad guys of the whole series. A very uncomfortable and tightrope-y alliance could have been fun. Add in that they both have deep connections to Swann for a bit more drama and stakes. 

Instead spectre gets wiped out at the start of the 2nd act and Safin goes genocidal poison doctor?

Also, did the one eyed henchman from the beginning of the movie just kind of switch sides after spectre was wiped out?",q3nxx2
hl89e3m,"I enjoyed it for what it was, but I also had alot of issues with it. 

I feel like Spectre should have been the finale of Craigs arc and this could have been rewritten to fit somewhere else. 

Safin as a villain was poorly written compared to the previous villains of Spectre and Skyfall - Bond had all of 2 minutes of screen time with him. I thought he was going to drop some kind of 'the virus doesn't attack children and I am going to remake the world' kind of motivation... but nothing. Rami Malek did well with what he was given.

The film ending in tragedy didn't sit well with me. Something more bittersweet suited this Bond more. Surviving but never being able to go near the two things most precious to him. 

The whole rehash of M being untrustworthy and involved with Heracles was also uneeded. Paloma was also underuitilised and what was the deal with the cigar.

He all of a sudden loves this girl? He could have kidnapped her whenever he liked before bond. Also why the hell does he care about bond, and what was the master plan? Kill everyone? Then who were the buyers?

It’s like they needed to end the movie and had the goal of killing bond so they just kinda did whatever. Which leads me to the question of *why kill bond?* viewers and fans of the series are used to there being different actors playing him. It’s not like we’re not capable of recognizing different actors playing the role.

Also bond is a badass, if they wanted him to not have the wife and kid he could’ve had him  escape the island and just never be able to see them in person. There. Sad ending with a bachelor bond.

It was a nice looking fun ride even though it dragged a little near the second hour, but it would’ve been a fine movie if they’d just not gone for a heavy ending.

hg2gasg,"Casino Royale will always be the perfect James Bond movie to me. A little more subdued and grounded. Closer to a spy thriller with some action setpieces than a full-on action movie. 

With that being said, I think this might be my second favorite or tied with Skyfall in the Daniel Craig series. I had a lot of fun with it. Amazing and impressive action on the level of Mission: Impossible that actually looks real (instead of those fake-looking CGI fests in most modern blockbusters). Really effective and nicely-placed humor too. I smiled and laughed plenty of times throughout. Only complaint: way too little Ana De Armas.

I'm going to miss Daniel Craig. I grew up with him as James Bond, and Casino Royale came out during a really fun time in my life and was a classic. So, I will always remember this timeline. All that said, I'm glad they chose to end it the way they did even though it did water my eyes.

Since everyone was fleeing, couldn’t they just hold off, extract bond and then blow it up with a larger crew of people?

It was nice to see a Bond film that actually was about saving the end of the world (more or less). Not low stakes like Quantum of Solace was.

The action sequences I think were the best we have seen yet, the stairway scene and car chases for example were proper edge of your seat stuff.

A bit disappointed we didn't see more of Ana De Armas. She played such a fun character and I wanted to see more of her, but now Bond is dead, I doubt her and other great characters like Q, Moneypenny and M will return played by the same actors.

Which kinda brings up where we go from here. James Bond always returns, just because he died here doesn't mean we will see a female 007 lead the franchise or the same universe carried on without him. There will be a reboot, a new actor and a new set of stories. Personally I would like to see Richard Madden take the role on.

hkmsmf6,"In summary, **No Time to Die** has an incredible, riveting start. As we progress further through the movie, it was *setup* to increasingly amplify the magnitude of action, intensity, depth, suspense, and emotion. I would say the movie has a similar *setup* and parallels to **The Dark Knight Rises**. In the aforementioned, we start with the unforgettable scene with Bane on the plane, with the movies twists, action, emotion, and magnitude increasing exponentially to its culmination. **No Time to Die** is similar in *setup*. Everything needed to make this epic, the culmination of the Craig-Bond era, is in place. Although as one reviewer aptly put it, it misfires. If I had to opine on the reasons behind that, I would say these brilliant sequences were perhaps shot many times to try and achieve this perfection, draining the actors (and audience) of emotion, and eventually settling for what is 80% of what each scene & sequence was intended to be. Instead of increasing in universal intensity of emotion & action, as it appears *setup* to achieve, where the movie starts as like a pot of water sizzling, to then boiling, to the pot cover shaking from the boil & evaporation, culminating in the pot cover flying off the stove — it achieves the opposite. 

As each pivotal twist & sequence occur, where the scenes just fall short of perfection, this failure to deliver instead culminates as if it were a serial dilution in a lab (a fitting analogy), where each sequence falling short of its intended magnitude increasingly dilutes the essence, impact, and immersion of the movie. This accumulating failure to deliver on its intended perfection leaves the viewer increasingly conditioned and acclimated, where by the end of the movie, instead of the pot cover flying off — its ending occurs as so anti-climatic for what it was set to achieve, it leaves the viewer frustratingly unfulfilled & without closure. The pot cover does not fly off, instead the water evaporates until the pot is empty, as is the viewer. 

I am unsure how to rate the movie. Superficially, it’s a good movie, but for what it was *setup* to achieve, by the end, this accumulated failure to deliver occurs as an abortion of not just the prior parts of the movie, but an upsetting, retroactive homicide of the would-be, cemented glory achieved in the previous Craig-Bond movies. 

For that reason, I would frankly **recommend the audience to simply stop the movie before the last 15-20 minutes, and let it remain a mystery of what may have occurred & tantalize to your imagination, as anything your imagination may yield will surpass what the movie provides.**

**Conclusion:** A 10/10 movie concept, an 8/10 in actuality, but a 3/10 if you consider what the movie could have been: a 10/10 artful perfection, versus the eternally frustrating execution where the movie consistently gives you a glimpse of what it could have been, robbing it from you, and leaving you with less than you even had before.",q3nxx2

I didn't have a clear understanding of exactly what Safin's end goal was after he slaughtered the entirety of SPECTRE.

He's going to release this nanobot plague on the world... why? He stole DNA samples around the world... whose? And why?

hg8hth9,"I enjoyed the movie overall. I think it continued the trend of ""Every Other Craig Film"" being good but out how the 3 good films I found this to be the weakest. Here are just some thoughts of what I liked/disliked:

Pros:

* Was never really a fan of Craig as Bond but his performance here was great. Really good sendoff for his era. 
* Some storylines they did were interesting and first for the series. They pulled it off quite well.
* Really had fun with Lashana Lynvh's role. Wish the film showed more of her and Craig competing with each other. Movie was pretty serious but this would have been fun to have more of.
* Recurring cast members were good as always
* Solid action scenes. While I love things like the MCU and Star Wars it's awlays refreshing to see a film like MI or Bond where its more practical action scenes. 

Cons:

* IMO there was no need for this movie to be three hours. The three hour length really impacted the pacing. The first hour is pretty nonstop but the last two I felt bored at times.
* Raimi Malek was a good villain but they didn't give him much to do.

-RM’s character felt underdeveloped. I’m also kind of irked that all the villains had some physical deformity. At least connect it to the working with the poison.
-I felt that around 15 minutes could have been cut.
-I know that this Bond is supposed to be more realistic; a few more gadgets or seeing him improvise weapons would have been cool, if not a little similar to the Bourne series.

Ana de Armas is the best part of the movie. The sequence in Cuba is super fun, would definitely be down to see her character return in some fashion in the future.

Craig is still solid, for sure going to miss him as Bond. Really enjoyed his relationship with Madeleine Swann as well, just wish they had more time on screen together.

Random thoughts on this movie in particular

* I had a hard time with the romantic aspects of the movie.   We had multiple professions of love from Bond to Madeliene - I personally couldn't too attached to them as a couple.  Maybe it was their questionable on-screen chemistry?
* When are we going to move beyond the ""Protaganist shoots about 100 bad guys on his/her way to the control room"" trope?  This happened over and over in this film, first in Cuba then the last 45 minutes on the island. 
*  What was Lyutsifer's motivations for wanting to kill millions?  Mental illness?  Continuing his father's work?  The film spent too little time on Lyutsifer in general and who he is outside of revenge on Spectre.
* Why did Lyutsifer even kidnap Madeliene and her daughter?  To make a family?
* The movie needed more Paloma.  It would have been nice to see Bond, Paloma and Nomi team up in the last act.
* How many close-up explosions did Bond endure in this movie?  LOL  I think I couldn't at least 3 of them - and he just bounced right back.

Overall a decent movie though, and about what I expected after Skyfall and Spectre.  

It will be interesting to see where this series goes now that Amazon owns 50% of the franchise.  I personally would like to see the series get a bit more grounded in reality and not so serious.  The cold war conspiracy Bonds from Roger Moore and Sean Connery are some of my favorites, and it would be nice to a few Bond films tracking down some more down-to-earth bad guys.",q3nxx2
hqqcnqs,"**SPOILERS**

Alright, I'm late to the party so nobody will see this unless they sort by new. But I would rate this film 8/10 and it's up there with Casino Royale and Skyfall for me. I really enjoyed it and thought it was a great sendoff for Craig

**PROS**

- I liked that they killed off Bond. I'm kinda shocked that so many people disliked it. Seemed like there was a high probability of that happening since it was Craigs last film. I see people asking, ""how will they explain it in the next film?"" The next film will reset the whole Bond universe, same characters but different actors with different plots. This is always how the Bond films have been. Once a new actor takes over Bond everything starts over

- That final scene with Bond was a real tear jerker for me. That score by Hans Zimmer definitely didn't help. It hit me hard because Craig has been Bond for my whole adulthood. I was in my teens when CS came out and now I'm in my thirties. Kinda sad to know he won't play Bond anymore

- I thought the action scenes were great. I see some people complaining about ""not enough action."" Did we watch the same film? There was solid action throughout this film. I thought it was a good variety in terms of foot chases, car chases, gun play, CQC, and they all took place in different environments which was cool. 

- That long stairwell shot was dope. I wouldn't mind seeing a BTS of that specifically. The director was the same guy who directed ""that episode"" of True Detective and won an emmy for it

- I loved how the signature turn and shoot was actually used during an action scene

- The dialogue and humor was good. Jokes were well placed. ""Another child?"" ""Double 0 what?""

- It was nice to see Felix in there. He should've been in Skyfall and Spectre so I'm glad he got a decent send off too

- The 15-min scene in Cuba was fun. Ana de Armas did good in her limited screen time

**CONS**

- In the beginning I was a bit confused at who the villains were and who was doing what. This was partly because I forgot what happened in Spectre

- The main villain (Malek) was pretty shallow. This seems to be the biggest complaint I see from most people and I agree. He didn't even show up until halfway through. I understood his motive to kill Spectre but after that I don't see his reasoning to want to cause mass genocide. His character didn't have much depth. Waltz should've been the main villain again. Could've built on his character from Spectre and he's obviously a great actor.

- That scientist guy was annoying. They used him as the comedic relief but it just didn't work in terms of the plot. They should've had him be much more serious

- Some of the gunplay was unrealistic. There were times where Lynch and Armas both shot machine guns with one hand. Kinda hard to believe that CIA/MI6 operators would handle weapons like that. Same thing with shooting pistols one-handed. Anyone with firearms training will shoot with both hands unless the situation dictates they cant, which is very very rare

- Hard to believe Vesper was only 23yrs old during CR. 33 would've been more realistic

- They never explained how Waltz was able to run things while in a high security maximum prison

Overall whoever takes over for Craig has big shoes to fill. I remember back when he was cast there was big backlash from everyone. He ended up knocking it out of the park though. I think over time we will look back on his five films as some of the best Bond movies",q3nxx2
hft59ej,"couldn't understand the end. i understand why Safin wanted to kill spectre, to get revenge for why his family died. but then why was he gonna kill a bunch of other people around the world? was it like some kind of thanos, like, there's too many people type thing? was it only a specific kind of person, cuz i remember the scientist made that comment right before he died along the lines of ""i dont need a lab to kill your race"" when talking to the new 007. if there was any kind of justification, i dont remember what it was, so the whole villain in general just felt like a very bland ""oh im gonna destroy the world!"" kind of thing.",q3nxx2

hgqr7ml,"I would place is as a solid #3 in terms of Craig's Bond movies.

It had some great action sequences, especially the car chase at the beginning, the whole Havana scene, and the stair case at the end. Craig's bond always excelled in doing the gritty action sequences.

Why they didn't give Ana de Armas more scenes is just bizarre. She did a fantastic job. She is a star and I understand they've gotten away from the ""Bond Girl"" characters, but her character held her own. That and her and Craig have a good chemistry as they were in ""knives out"" together.

Jeffrey Wright deserved more screen time then what he got, and his death was so anti-climactic. Just gut shot in a boat in the middle of the gulf. Logan Ash was shoehorned in there.

Lashana Lynch was fantastic, could definitely see her as doing her own ""007"" movie as a stand alone in the ""MI6 Universe"".

Rami Malek could have brought more to the table, but they just wrote a bad character. His back story is vague, his motives are vague. It's almost like they wrote the character to just give Craig a villain who wasn't Blofeld to end his tenure as Bond.

Overall, they need to get better writing and stop with these soft spoken, vague, unemotional villains. They need a character with conviction and personality. Bardem was really the only one that seemed to rise up to match Craig's intensity as Bond.

Bonds daughter was adorable. I just wanted to hug her when she lost her doo doo lol. But was perplexed that the villain just let her go. Also I wonder how hard it must have been to shoot scenes with her.

hkkdajx,"I’ve just watched the film in Australia (finally!) and I find it really interesting how both the Batman franchise with Nolan and the Daniel Craig Bond films have paralleled each other, essentially NTTD mimicking the end of the Dark knight rises. 

I would have loved more ambiguity like the dark knight rises instead of straight killing him off (not having shown him get blown up by the rocket and the daughter’s toy returning to her could have been a ending that worked well.) 

This film was weird for me, it felt very inconsistent with how Daniel Craig has portrayed bond in the last few films especially with more comedic elements to his quips. I loved some of the action set pieces. I don’t mind them killing off Daniel Craig’s James Bond but it didn’t have the gravitas or the emotional weight behind it that Skyfall had with M dying or Casino had with Vespar’s Death . Rami Malek was probably miscast and miswritten as the villain. It needed someone who can go toe to toe with Bond like Silva and Le Chiffe did to earn that death of James Bond. It just didn’t feel right to me. 
It’s going to be really interesting what they do next. Do they do a Dark reboot with a younger unestablished actor as bond or try and continue with an established name like Henry Cavill? I’m predicting they either go in a totally new direction and race bend the character with someone like Rege Jean Page. It would be interesting to see that take. Very interesting times ahead for us Bond fans! I’m interested to hear what you thought!",q3nxx2

1. Why was Nomi in Jamaica if M and her team did not want James involved? She basically tipped the scale for him to get involved, so why did M even send her out there?

2. Did James retire after Spectre, they captured Blofeld then he took off on a car ride with Madeline, but was it implied he retired or quit after moving to Jamaica?

3. There's a scene where the Russian scientist drops the USB and replaces it with another in front of Cyclops, but at this point Cyclops switched sides on Spectre and is working with the Russian, Nash, and Lucifer Saffin right? So why fake the USB thing, they both want to kill off Spectre",q3nxx2

A lot of the movie didn’t make sense. Why didn’t the villain kill Bond in the forest? He just kidnapped the woman and her daughter. He could’ve done that any time. Why is Q on the plane over the island? He can also pilot air carriers, too? Why didn’t they bring other agents with them to infiltrate an island base? There’s no need for stealth at this point and Bond wasn’t kidnapped there. A poison farm? That’s been operated in contested waters for over 20 years? Isn’t there a lot of military activity and scouting in that region? It also looks fairly visible from a satellite. And they have a lot of people working for them. Nobody snitched? I don’t fully understand the villain’s motive. Originally they’re going to release the virus across the world. Now they’re selling it to different global entities. What? The Russian scientist talks way too much and I don’t really know his motives. Does he want money or does he just hate people? The Cuba fight also felt goofy. I’ve been to Cuba before. Havana is densely populated. The police would’ve been on site earlier. The whole plot to kill Bond in Cuba also feels convoluted and comical.

Some points for me:

-beautiful cinematography throughout especially during establishing shots and action sequences (that one-take fight scene on the stairwell)

-for a nearly 3 hour film, it didn't feel like there were any moments where it was dragging and it was briskly paced 

-Ana De Armas had more of an extended cameo but her brief time on screen was so much fun and I would love to see more of her in a future Bond film

-the sound design and Hans Zimmer soundtrack was great

-incredible stuntwork especially in the opening set piece in Matara, the Cuba sequence, and the forest scene were standouts for me

-Lynch's ""007"" character as a sort of rival and then partner to Craig worked really well

Although I read too much about the action cause I got my hopes too high for it. Like, it was solid, but people made it seem like it was The Raid of spy movies or something.

It was amusing seeing him be able to survive so many explosions, the Stormtrooper aim on the regular baddies contrasted with Saffin just popping a bunch in him all casually, and him dispatching people in the forest like a ninja but then letting the most obvious bad guy get the jump on him. 

That stuff makes me roll my eyes a little, but I dunno, it's so excessively common that it's just become another movie thing to me.

The important thing is that this movie made me feel all sorts of genuine emotions, and now I gotta pour one out for the homie. That was definitely an awesome send-off.",q3nxx2
hgbn8p4,"Ok. Well, I don't think it's a bad movie by any means. The first 2/3rds of the movie is pretty great. As mentioned a million times already, the Ana De Armas stuff was a lot of fun. I think everything leading up to Blofeld's death was actually quite solid.   
  
Once the film ditches Spectre/Blofeld, it loses a lot of steam. And that's disappointing because the forest scene with the fog has some quintessential Craig moments. It's just everything after Blofeld feels shoehorned in (all except Bond's daughter, but even that's not so clean).   
  
Also, pretty big nitpick here from me: but I felt like Craig was a little too schlocky at times. It was a slight departure from the Bond in Skyfall and Spectre, and normally I wouldn't care, but the slight tonality shift in the character is a little jarring when you're watching these movies back to back.

hfu99wz,"Coming hot out of the theater and all I can think about was how amazing that forest sequence was! My favorite part of these recent Bond movies is the hectic action with a calm camera, and that scene was just savage and classy in all the right ways. I wish Rami was in it more, but I loved his presence in this movie, he made a great villain. All the female leads totally crushed it, I'm all in for a female Bond if the studio wants to do that. This was such a fun movie experience, however, I've got some gripes and I'd love to hear what others think as well. 

1. The humor. ""I showed him your watch, it really blew his mind"" what the fuck? They really turned the puns up to 11 this time around and it got worse as the movie went along. 

2. The third act, we've got to bring it up. This movie worked so well throughout it's duration but everything that happens once they get to the island is a rushed, paint by the numbers series of events until we get to saying goodbye to Bond. It was at this point I realized Bond wasn't getting off that island. They were just dumping all the tropes onto the screen at once. Bond shoots at the camera (which was sick), villain introduction with a silly plan, all the characters from the series around to witness the farewell, the goofy gadgets, the music, etc. And for a series that took pride in being different, this was like an undoing of all of that. Skyfall and Casino Royale felt like breaths of fresh air but the ending of this felt like watching the movies from the 70s again. It felt less like a proper goodbye to Craig's Bond movies and more like a studio executive came in and demanded these things be shoved in (gotta mark everything off the checklist!). In those moments, it was obvious we were watching a movie. Thankfully, it grounded itself again just after Malik dies. Seeing Bond limp away and then climbing that ladder was heartbreaking. 

3. That interrogation scene. Did anyone actually think Bond wasn't gonna touch Blofeld? For a character that was keeping his cool through so much shit, it seemed out of place for him to lose it at that point. Like grabbing the enclosure and whispering ""die"" but then giving up on killing him mere seconds later? How convenient. I know Bond needed a reason to visit his love interest, but this seemed lazy. 

Overall, big fan of this one. I'd put it behind Skyfall and Casino Royal, but it knocks the socks off of Quantum and Spectre. Craig was my favorite Bond and I'm looking forward to meeting the next 007. Who knows, maybe it'll come out sooner rather than later due to the delays this one faced. Regardless, solid 7/10 in my books. Thank you Craig for an awesome 15 years!",q3nxx2
hg1o9av,"Kind of funny that the entire film made such a big deal out of Nomi like “See! We can have a cool female character in this series who kicks ass, assists the mission and doesn’t sleep with Bond” only for Ana De Armas to do all the above in one scene and steal the film.",q3nxx2
hgdoan5,"I definitely enjoyed seeing this one in theaters! I'd personally rank it in position 3/5 of Daniel Craig's Five 007 films, below Casino Royale, and Skyfall.  
  
Great visuals and cinematography (I go see Bond movies for the spectacle!). The opening sequence transition into nighttime cityscape with reflection, and the establishing overhead shot of the wooded trail leading to the remote cabin in the summer (in contrast to the opening shot in the winter) were especially well done! I have appreciated that there has been some continuity of characters and plot between all films with Daniel Craig as Bond, rather than being one off adventures that reset with each new film!  
  
Great quips, great comic relief from Billy Magnussen as Logan Ash and David Dencik as Valdo Obruchev. Nomi holds her own as a professional, modern 00 agent.  
  
I think there were some issues with pacing and Rami Malek as Lyutsifer Safin was not nearly as memorable a villain as Silva or Blowfield, but those are tough acts to follow. The plot element of the Heracles virus being a pet project of M/MI6 I think was quite believable - something developed as a super efficient deterrent being hijacked to unintentional chaotic ends by someone with more sinister intentions.  
  
I think this was an appropriate ending for Daniel Craig as James Bond. Bond is a tragic character, and this ending had emotional impact. (Didn't hit me as hard as Logan, but still impact).  
  
James Bond has been called the King Midas of Death, and in this ending, he gave up his own life when is touch would have physically killed the two most important people to him.  
Madeline and Mathilde mattered to Bond much more so than random Bond Girl flings, and that was 100% believable to me.  
  
Ana de Armas' scenes as the rookie agent (NOT a romantic interest) were well handled (which was something they did with Olga K. in Quantum).",q3nxx2

hh2i3bv,"I decided to watch Spectre the night before and I was 100% glad I did because it made me enjoy the continuity so much more. 

This movie did a radically great job with tying up the Craig Saga, and perhaps more impressively the events of Spectre, since that movie was pretty nonsensical in plot and development. Madeline's relationship with Bond in this felt real and grounded which really sold the tragic climax. The opening act with the spectre attack conveyed so well that Blofeld was a thorn in Bond's  side and his preoccupation with destroying his life. It almost felt serialized like the start of a Bond tv series and really sold me on Blofeld being Bond's legit archenemesis. I loved the throwback to Dr. No with Safin's sartorial sense, the whole secret island base, etc. When the series started, it established it's divergence, and significance, from the previous Bond iterations: this was a grounded, gritty take. And that continued through Skyfall. Spectre returned to the more campy, over the top Bond genre and it was done badly. But this movie blended the classic dramatic supervillian, spy tech and gadgets, quippy Bond formula with a grounded, violent backdrop much better and I thoroughly enjoyed it. 

Some critiques I don't agree with. Surprised comments about Ana de Armas being in just one scene/act. All the promos, posters and trailers, basically conveyed that she would be just one scene so why are y'all surprised. Its amazing how adding playing up one characterization,  the bubbly go lucky new field agent,  can do so much to make what could've just been a hot chic with a gun into something so much more enjoyable, dimensional, and memorable. I think Phoebe Waller Bridge gets the cred for that. 

Another complaint I read: Safin was underdeveloped. This character had as much motivation, if not more than Silva. Loved how they took a line from Madeline in Spectre and developed it into the backstory of the villain. The opening sequence had legit horror vibes and his limp, voice, and costume actually left an extremely effective imprint. Yes, they might've gone from wanting to take revenge on Spectre to controlling the world quickly but they devote two pivotal scenes of dialogue to him expressing his motivation and basically conveying that he was insane and saw himself as a God. Other than the opening scene, I wish Malek did more in his expository face off with Bond; more loose cannon or nuanced emotion maybe, just something to put him on par with Javier Bardem's expository scene with M in prison. 

I'll end with something that did feel quite off: the cut of Blofeld's interrogation. Idk if it was the given direction but Craig's movement with his right hand was noticeably animated, maybe to tip off the audience on what's about to happen, but any intelligent viewer already knows and the choice to  telegraph it super hard detracted from the scene. Craig's delivery of some lines also felt non traditional to his depiction of Bond. I could accept the explanation that part of his character development is becoming more human and emotive than the stoic, smug proud smolder machine introduced in Casino Royale but would've liked to see more of those interactions with other villains to build that up. I read that him choking Blofeld was a direct reference to that interaction in Fleming's novel so I guess they decided to put it in this incarnation. 

All in all, had a great time and enjoyed the movie. 9/10",q3nxx2
hkgzb63,"I... Didn't like this. It fails for me because the emotional crux of the movie is the relationship between Bond and Swan but I never bought that relationship in the first place. Like, there's a reason these movies are still talking about Vesper. I actually felt emotional when he was at her grave and her theme played. That's how you do a romance!

The villain was confusing and I'm still upset about the misuse of Blofeld. 

The movie was really well shot imo. Loved the opening bit with the Spectre team breaking through the window and the stairway fight. Acting was great, in particular Ana De Armas stole every scene she was in. Loved her character. As usual with the bad ones in this franchise, the faults lie in the writing.",q3nxx2
hkzaknt,"I’m late to the party here as I live in Melbourne where NTTD was released last week, but this might be the most outraged and gobsmacked I’ve felt in a while leaving a cinema. 
This was a heartbreaking end. Enthralling, but heartbreaking. We really got to know this Bond on quite a deep level. For this series of films (Craig’s own Bond universe I guess), he went through so much, while being in the spy espionage life or trying to escape it. Bad just followed him. You would expect a nice and neat ending after so much bad. So for the series to end like this, it’s a surprising and ballsy approach and I totally respect it. 

I think it elevates Craig’s Bond series overall. I feel like he should be spoken about as one of the better characters in any film series. I know James Bond overall as a character is great, but Craig’s Bond was just on another level. We saw him go through so much mental trauma, I feel like this type of heartbreaking ending was inevitable but somehow touching. The one’s he cares for are all safe it seems. He felt comfortable with that, even if he knew he wouldn’t be there. An epic ending. 

Also respect to C Fukunaga for the great direction, respect to H Zimmer for the great music, and respect to D Craig for a memorable and defining performance to end his reign as James Bond.",q3nxx2
hla63lb,"TL:DR  the first half felt like a romantic action thriller ""Casino Royale 2"" I was waiting for. Then the second half felt like watching my students play Counter Strike... and lost.

 **The Good (aka: the first half)** The cold open feels like a gritty Coen Brothers short film, which is perfect.The romantic opening in Italy, especially the indoor lighting in their room at night, the cinematography was just so gorgeous . Then the Jamaica scenes, also beautiful. All the homages to earlier films and to Ian Fleming himself. Cuba mission, also love it. Love Paloma. Love Bond playfully competing with the other 007.

I also like the cyclop's death. I haven't seen a good PG-13 unique villain death in a Bond movie for a long time now. 

**The Ba... Really? (aka: the second half)** The second half is like a different film. No, not different film. Like a video game continuation of what just happened.

***1) Irrelevance villain.*** This Safin is almost like a good guy. He's offing Spectre, the only thing that made him evil started with his agent shot Leiter. He even saved Madeline's life when she was a child. If he was not going to be a gray villain, why not just have her run away successfully so he would be a more satisfying villain to kill? Even her mother was not sympathetic. Also Safin had nothing to do with Vesper's grave exploding. Which makes him even less relevance to the story to become the final guy of the... quadrilogy?

***2) M needed to die*** I thought the passive aggressive approach to talking with M was a bit lazy. First they were so mad at each other in the office, then they start to speak casually when they are outside. This would have made sense if there was a development in between.In this kind of movie about frankenstein monster, the monster's creator needed to die. M just... carries on after all that he did. Good intention my ass.

***3) The Stairway Shooting Scene***  
I started to not enjoy the movie when I watch James killing faceless soldiers in the stairway for what felt like six hours, and I thought I had the same experience watching my students play online game. Was that even one long take? I don't remember and I don't really care.

Also, I love the new 007. But having her kill that scientist over something he said is a bit immature. She always play by the book the whole movie. She was the perfect agent as an anti-thesis to Bond. Why have her do that?  (why have the scientist said that at all?) Is that supposed to imply that race will always be a factor to her and that she couldn't act professionally? **If you are a 00 agent, the by the books kind, your race should be England.** I think the writer took away a lot from her character by doing that.

***4) Bond's death***

I personally don't mind that he died... but I thought more people would mind. I guess they can't put spoiler in the headline of the news, that's why there's not enough coverage of the outrage.  But I mind HOW he died.

I guess he doesn't want there to ever be a possibility that he might have accidentally come in contact with Madeline and their daughter. Because it's not just awkward, it's DEATH!

But come on, there are more heroic deaths than that. As sweet as it was for any other character, **Bond should have died for his country.** The comment below me is perfect. **He could have die propping the gate open.** There was a moment where he had to choose safety of the world over his daughter when he shot at Serafin as he was holding her, and they could have expanded on that.

Anyway, the cinematography of the romantic night in Italy alone is worth the price of admission. And they did a lot of brave thing. But the island stuff felt like video game. In a way it's similar to Die Another Day. I like Die Another Day first half more than most people. But the invisible car and ice palace, ending with cgi giant wave... well. This one is a lot more restrained than that. But it was still pretty bad way to end a beautiful and emotional movie.

hfwjyee,"Someone I know made a good point about modern Bond films is that, apart from Casino Royale, they still suffer from a lot of the weaknesses classic Bond movies suffered from in regards to plot development.

Everything feels like it's made up as they go from scene to scene rather than crafting a story and then fleshing out the details.

For example how the villain in this movie has the motivation of killing SPECTRE, succeeds halfway through the film and then has decided to either sell the nanovirus or just wipeout large sections of the population.

Or how M was responsible for commissioning technology to kill people via their DNA when in the last movie he was adamantly against a drone programme which would allow people to be killed without sending agents in the field. He saw the value in having someone make a judgement call on assignment instead of straight up killing someone because someone behind a desk deemed him a target.

The problem is that No Time To Die tries to be that third film for Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace whilst simultaneously being the third film for Skyfall and Spectre. It wants to tie up loose ends for stories that were never fully fleshed out and ends up becoming a mess of a plot. In a perfect world, we could have received that final third film to Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. Bond forgiving Vesper. Felix's death and revenge. We could have also received a third film to Skyfall and Spectre. If they introduced Spectre early on, then Skyfall, and then finally the extra plots to No Time To Die.

The movie isn’t perfect, but I really enjoyed it, probably my favorite since Casino Royale. There some weird plot holes, like how is it that they create this nanobot virus but they can’t create a cure? Why was there an urgency to send missiles into the island, why not send missiles to the approaching ships. MI6 knows there’s a virus loose and they don’t have any sort of scan to detect the virus when they send people in to interrogate Blofeld?

This has nothing to do with the actress herself, who seems to be quite talented. Her role just felt like ""look at me I'm not a white male Bond"" and ""haha I'm not old white male Bond who is so out of date, so I'm here for the teasing comedic fodder and killing racist dude"". I kind of expected her to talk about her wife, to be honest. She could have been put to so much better use (or even be more prominently featured in a spin-off), especially with the clear talent of Ms. Lynch. Every scene with her could have been fairly easily replaced with either 1) just Bond or 2) a slight variation that didn't involve her, which leads me to believe this is more of a Hollywood studio decision to appear diverse and inclusive, without much substance behind it (the worse kind, again speaking as a minority). If you disagree tell me honestly if they would have done the exact same role with a white male dude, and you know the answer is no. If you think otherwise, debate and discuss respectfully instead of downvoting. Great actress, but forced inclusion for this role specifically.",q3nxx2

So he checks out because someone told him he might kill a family member if he gets near to them, and doesn't think ""ok I'll go to another spot on the planet and figure out how to get rid of these nanobots; I don't believe Q, and I don't believe [insert bad guy]"".

However it was kind of bullshit he put five bullets in James and he still managed to overpower him break his arm and shoot him so it's kind of a tie. he made sure James didn't get a happy ending. That was the direction to go. everytime james tried to retire and settle down people end up dying.Hes not suppose to have one. I also noticed there's a lot of shots where James is just standing in the open and somehow he does not get shot. Especially at the beginning the part where he's between the motorcyclist and the car there's no way he could not get shot lol. Another thing in the beginning the female 007 was annoying they're making her try to one up James like who the hell is she? she hasn't done anything while this man is a legend and shes telling him not to stand in my way.

He’s always good, but he really got to be funny in ways his Bond was rarely allowed to be before. 

The highlight for me was the shootout in the forest. The sound design was unbelievable; I haven’t seen a setpiece quite like that in a Bond movie before, it felt like something out of Metal Gear.

Bond villains do love their islands!

Also - would have loved to have seen the political outcome of the island being flattened by the Royal Navy.

Also given we are in a world that's rich with advanced tech couldn't they just program a virus to kill the nano bots off so Bond could be fine? And Saffin was great and creepy but Blofeld has been behind everything up until this point and ACTUALLY has a motive to control the world. They could have got rid of Saffin, had Blofeld try to poison Bond and a rogue scientist screws him over instead like we saw, then the final fight could have been him and Bond to bring an end to Spectre and close out Craig's Era as Bond. Still not sure if Killing him was the best, Goldeneye established James was his real name it's not a code name so saying ""James Bond Will Return"" means you have to hire all new actors for Q and M and all of them or figure out how to explain a different Bond with the same people.",q3nxx2

Like so many others, Craig was my Bond and I’m so glad they gave him such a great sendoff. He took that series to a whole different level in terms of the emotional weight of a Bond movie that no other Bond was able to get to. The girl sitting next to me was sobbing for the last 10 minutes and I shed a tear or two myself.

As a movie I’d give this an 82/100. As a fun Bond movie I’d put it in the 90s. The plot was rough and they suffered big time trying to tie up loose ends from Spectre. Rami Malik’s performance was great, but the character was pretty poorly written which is unfortunate because I saw a ton of potential in him. Ana de Armas was so damn ~~hot~~ good and I really wish we could’ve gotten more of her. The last 20 minutes (specifically the one-shot going up the stairs) were fucking awesome. That was some Cary Fukunaga shit straight outta True Detective.

I’m guessing it will divisive among Bond fans, but I love that he died in the end. The idea of standalone action/spy movies that you can watch in any order is great, but it’s really hard to develop a character like Bond throughout multiple movies without carrying characters and storylines over. Give the Craig era a few years to breathe and reset it with some new actor and another unique take on Bond.

There's a lot of other formulas breaks which have been done before such as bond falling in love. It doesn't really work to be honest. I never saw chemistry between the actors which make it worse as well. 

Replacing the 007 code number was new but fun. 

Remi malek villain has absolutely no general motivation for mass genocide. Pretty weak villain to be honest and destroying specter in some throwaway plot just felt cheaply earned. 

Also someone a huge metal gear fan to adopt FOXDIE, Nano machines, and infiltrating a sub pen.

Once Blofeld died all the reasoning behind the plot became weak as hell.

Sure the antagonist had a new superweapon, but really it's no difference between him having it and the government having it... the ability to assassinate anyone, specifically, with no trace and almost no defense?  It's scary no matter who's controlling it.

Then they add some throwaway line about Safin wanting to kill everyone in the world (why???) but he doesn't need a DNA targeted nanobot weapon for that, regular smallpox will do the job.  And the villain has a personal vendetta against Bond (again, why???) and specifically needs to ruin his life and set up his death.",q3nxx2

Madeleine's dad works for Spectre. He is ordered to kill the Safins. Lyutsifer survives, hunts down Madeleine's cabin, kills her mom, then saves her from the ice.

5 years later, Safin reenters Madeleine's life as she is the only person that Blofeld trusts; this is perfect as Safin is trying to kill him.

Not as much as I loved Skyfall, but as a character driven Bond movie it was excellent. There are some weird moments, but that’s just Bond. 

Seeing Bond find the happy ending he’s been trying to earn since Casino Royale with reach and then having it implicitly ripped from him was gut wrenching, and a level of cruelty from Safin we haven’t seen from any Bond villain ever. (He’s also the only one I can think of to explicitly threaten a child) 

Bond choosing to die doing his duty rather than live life unable to touch his family was incredible and fitting. Craig’s Bond is always unable to do one thing: escape.

Safin was an interesting villain. His forced metaphor about wanting the world a little cleaner as an attempt to justify his plan for genocide was weak, and like… what happened to those other ships that were coming to buy it?

As long as the movie was, I wouldn’t mind seeing a full director’s cut. Snyder Cut style. At home, pause for bathroom breaks. There’s clearly a lot more going on. There was definitely a meta conversation about international relations (Felix mentions that MI6 and the CIA and the two state departments aren’t talking anymore) that seems to have been cut at some point.

- An incredibly silly and unscientific doomsday device.
- Muddled to inconsistent to nonexistent characterizations:

*  * The biggest inconsistency is Bond just giving up and dying at the end, something so out of character for Craig's determined and resourceful Bond that it made me unable to take the death seriously. I kept thinking he must've faked his own death to avoid dealing with living the family life!

* * Safin was so underdeveloped as a character. We know he wants revenge on Spectre for killing his family. But once he did that, why did he want to mass murder more people? We got one confused little speech about surprising people with death.
- Gigantic plot holes: Most notably the completely unnecessary urgency to blow up the doomsday factory at the end. But so many actions of the heroes and villains in the movie were either nonsensical or outright counterproductive to their stated goals!

I forgive some of the plot holes because of the humanity displayed by Craig’s Bond and the emotional evolution he takes throughout the films. I love seeing Bond vulnerable. He shows it in Casino with Vesper, then has it taken away. And you get that again, with more desperation, in this film right up until the end. His Bond desperately wanted to let his guard down and live in peace and never was able to. It felt like Craig enjoyed making this movie and he acted the hell out of it. Very eager to see it again. 

Also for Ana De Armas. Wow!",q3nxx2

hhgh7az,"I was expecting more after seeing the review score  on RT. Ana DeArmas was fun, Rami Malek was a weak villain with weak motivation (yes, he wanted to avenge me White killing his family, but why kill the whole world or many?). The climax in Japan also felt off, what were all those tubes and the acid for? To produce the nano bots/poison which also were rather generic as threat?

Was this movie bad? No. But when you can't even make a comprehensive story... It just feels like I've been cheated. Why was Sami Malek (Safin) even in this movie? Why introduce ANOTHER villain apart from the already established villain and evil syndicate you set up with the previous **four** movies? It makes no sense. Safin purpose as a character should have to break Stravro out of jail and attempt to get his revenge on him. But oh, Stravro gets the best of him and turns the tables. Now, you have an established villain with a motive & super weapon, freshly out of jail. Who Bond has to try and stop.

hfxaumv,"this movie was like a tasty steak unevenly cooked. some parts of it were perfectly cooked and other parts were pretty uncooked or rare. It had weird pacing issues, but despite that, I was getting pretty teary-eyed by the end.

\- Love, love, love all the references to OHMSS, from motto ""we have all the time in the world"" to the main theme used to using Louis Armstrong's song for the end.

\- love the Aston Martin Vatange from Living Daylights.

\- there's never really been a child in a bond movie and it was surprisingly refreshing to see. helped that the kid was adorable.

\- Malek as Safin was actually really good, just that all of his stuff was severely undercooked. They took way too long to set up his whole thing, and he's barely in the movie. Most of his stuff is a direct pull from You Only Live Twice (book), and I love the idea of his poison garden. We just don't get enough of it. Also I was confused as to what age he was. He seems to never age by how he is in the opening. And he survives getting shot by child Madeleine. I thought they were going to set up this idea that he discovered a cure for death and how to prolong his life at a cost, but then that is never explored.

\- love how Felix Leiter because became Wade from the Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies.

\- Worst part of the movie has to be Billy Magnussen. He just sticks out as an actor and he didn't fit in with this movie at all.

The soap opera sequences didn't work that well. To me, this is a film series where the hero drives a gun with machine guns behind the headlights, but kudos for trying to setup a bigger story for Bond.

The villain had no real weight or plausible story, no sense to what he was doing. For him to get the upper hand on Bond was trash. A feeble villain to take out Bond is a no.

If you watch it as a standalone film it's better, but after watching all of the JB films (apart from Timothy Dalton), that was not right.  Why even reference OHMSS so much when his wife isn't in it and they focus on Vesper? Craig was like a re-boot when he started, so we forget Diana Rigg and Terri Hatcher, so why bring back all the back story they jettisoned?

It's competently made, but that's it. I have never seen bad guys being so bad at their job from top to bottom and all of them. Spectre organization all died in the same place thinking they were playing a trick on Bond, then their goons got mowed off by 007, 007bis and Ana de Armas. Safin organization didn't do much better. They were awfully bad in their forest chase (Ash never was shown a skilled spy/hitman/leader). Safin asked nicely Bond to leave the island like they would change the fact that his position was known, then stayed just in the slight chance he could expose 007 to the nanobots in hand to hand combat. 

I mean good guys weren't better apart 007 and Ana de Armas. M developped a very dangerous bioweapon (in the middle of London), then easily lost it, let Blofeld keep directing Spectre from a higly secured prison where Blofeld still got killed invontarily by one of his own agent, and almost created a war between Japan/Russia and GB without informing his PM, but he still kept his job.

Lea Seydoux and Daniel Craig have 0 chemistry. They have negative chemistry. Craig sparks more with Naomi Harris and she's in like 2 minutes of the movie.

I have no idea what Remi Malik's endgame was. Kill spectre and then.. ? Wipe out everyone? That was a weird leap. Is this taking place in the Utopia universe?

Who the heck did bionic eye guy work for. At the start they're chasing bond after he visits vespers grave.

So they're working for blofield?

But then he's with Remi Malik's character? Did he switch sides? Were they just unrelatedly chasing Bond at the start but then...why?

 They wouldn't have cared about Bond then, and Lea Seydoux a character didn't go into hiding; so if they were after her they could have picked her up in the 5 year jump. She was literally working a 9-5 

Why was evil scientist so quick to betray spectre? Did he even work for spectre? He gets a phone call from Remi and is like 'yea ok sure, I guess I'm evil now'.

* The villain was terrible. Raimi Malik really sold the creepy, unhinged, and psychopath vibe, but he was barely in it. And, I really thought he would have used some toxins to make himself like a classic Bond villain with some outlandish side effects. He had the basic villain plotline 
* Craig killed it as Bond. This was a beautiful ending to his storyline. I do wish they bring back the same cast members for Q, M, and Moneypenny. Keep that Bond traditional alive. I am really glad they wrapped up a few storylines that started from Casino Royale. 
* The action set-pieces were outstanding. The score was even better. But Hans Zimmer's soundtracks are starting to blend together. It literally felt like I was listening to the Dark Knight's score during some emotional scenes. 
* Ana De Armas should really get a spin-off movie. I loved her character. A badass, carefree, funny operative.
* The movie was a tad bit long, but I honestly didn't care too much. We have been waiting for this movie since March 2020. 

My ranking of the Craig era:

* Skyfall
* Casino Royale
* No Time To Die
* Spectre
* Quantum of Solace

I am excited to see Craig hop from the charming British MI6 agent to the southern detective in the Knives Out sequels. And I am more excited to see who they bring on as the new Bond.",q3nxx2

I wasn't even sure what the villain's deal was by the end and it didn't seem like anyone in the movie did either. He was barely in the movie it seemed, and the new 007 was barely around either! The CIA girl seemed to completely upstage her for the short bit she was in.

To be fair though I saw this at a 1/4 full(if) Alamo Drafthouse and about half way through some jackasses behind us started talking every time things slowed down for some plot development. They were snickering, making fun of the tech, cracking jokes, and etc. Reported it, but the timing was off when they were trying to bust them and/or they just stayed quite while the servers were in there.

hg2dvbz,"The film was alright and I pretty much expected the ending, but in my opinion, I felt like the action and stunts doesn’t feel as entertaining as the other Craig era films.

Casino Royale was memorable with the bathroom fight, epic construction site parkour chase, airport chase, and the building slowly collapsing in the Grand Canal at Venice. I don’t remember much of Quantum of Solace, but I did like the car chase at the beginning and the exploding hotel in the last scene. Skyfall is probably my most favorite with the intro chase on the roofs and the train, the glass building fight at Shanghai, the London Underground chase, and the finale at the Bond estate. For Spectre, I liked the intro fight with Mexico City with the one-shot take and the helicopter, the snowy plane chase in Austria, and the final battle in London.

In this movie, I wasn’t given the same effect. Moments like the bridge jumping and the Aston-Martin miniguns were cool, but it felt like it lacked the same level of spectacle. Same thing with the forest fight. However, that one-shot stairway gunfight was awesome. I didn’t even notice it was all in one take until halfway through the scene. It’s probably my most favorite scene.

I think it focused more on gunfights and close-quarters combat instead of large-scaled action, which is why it felt so off. But it’s pretty weird to say that, since the film’s budget not only costs more than Spectre and Skyfall, but it’s most expensive out of all Bond films. That type of budget should’ve had some action that matched or surpassed previous films, but what we ended up with was a lot of slow-paced chases and gunfights. Don’t know if anyone else felt the same way, so it could just be me, but that’s how I felt after watching it.",q3nxx2

I know that living like that would have been so painful for him, but at least it would have been better that dying.

Also, the hope that a cure could eventually be discovered one day would probably have kept him going, as well as knowing that they're re safe and living in peace.

Craig acts his ass off in this film.  It’s perhaps his best Bond performance since Casino Royale, and I say that as someone who’s a big fan of his take on Bond.

Madeline is MUCH better here.  This film did a lot to redeem her character.  And Lea Seydoux is really damn good in general.

Paloma was a highlight.  I wish she was in the movie more and I’d love to see them bring her back in a future film perhaps.

Bond and Felix were great together here.  Craig and Jeffrey Wright always have a great dynamic in these films.

Most of the new characters were solid enough.

It’s a beautifully shot film and a lot of cool action scenes.

Safin, I was kind of mixed on.  Rami Malek is really great in the role.  He’s creepy and uncomfortable in every scene he’s in.  However I wish Safin’s ultimate motivations had been less, meh.

That ending, ok I think it worked for Craig’s take on Bond.  But I know it’s gonna be divisive and I can totally get why many might not like it.

The rivaly between him and the new 007 was fun to see. Blofield and Bond's scene reminded me alot of The Dark Knight's Joker interrogation scene. The nostalgia tropes of the one-liners, the little pokes at his womanizing, and the sort of gun barrel homage at the end were *chefs kiss*.  The forest set piece on Norway was incredible! 

However I didn't really care for Rami Malek's Safin. He just didn't do it for me as a villain compared to Le Chiffre or Silva. The Foxdie...or rather Heracles bioweapon is not something new as a plot point but I liked how this one was executed, being an origin of MI6. I know it's gonna be quite debated but THIS Bond having a child, I have no problem with that. 

I grew up with Brosnan's Bond, but Craig will so far be my favorite. Several years ago my parents gave me a box set of all the films up to Skyfall, and spent months watching them.

Found it interesting how all the earthly elements played a role in the movie (water, forests, fire, can't think of air right now). 

Wished they made me care about or fleshed out Saffin and his garden/acid water, Eye Guy or Ash.

From insanely poor villain/villains, to overall story, everything was just ok.

It's in line with other Craig Bond movies after Casino Royale, decent action and poor everything else. Casino Royale remains only Craig movie I enjoyed.

Cyclops was probably one of the least threatening henchmen in a while. For dude that's supposed to be scary and threatening he didn't do anything. 3 fights with Bond and 3 times he failed to do anything but get his ass kicked.

Main villain was just bad. They tried to make him deep and thought provoking but forgot to make him interesting.

Finally, what the fuck was all that about ""when her secret gets out it will be the death of you."" Unless he was just provoking Bond that made no sense whatsoever.

For all their ""she has secrets"" she didn't have any. Unless that was the whole point, lack of trust on Bonds part.

Don't know, don't care, just another Bond movie I'll forget quickly.

Hopefully next series of Bond movies is less connected and better. Connecting plot for multiple movies might sound like a good idea, but execution here was poor, with added bonus of few years between movies leading to forgetting half the shit.

Craig actually seemed like he was up for being in this one rather than phoning it in, and I actually thought the villain was pretty good. That moment where they were confronting each other over that table was a good moment imo. 

Lea Seydoux again just doesn’t really work for me in this role, her and Craig don’t have great chemistry and she’s just sort of bland. It’s made worse by how fun Ana de Armas is in her like five minutes of screen time. Same with the new 007 who’s just sort of there. It was also very contrived that she went off in the boat with Madeline and Matilde, makes way more sense for her to stay and Bond to go but whatever.

I think this movie hits a pretty big lull mid-way through where there wasn't any action and the plot wasn't all that interesting. It picks up near the end though.

That said, this film was a bit of a letdown. It's still better than most of what the other franchises in the space put out, but compared to Casino Royale or Skyfall, No Time to Die is a little disappointing. The plot was very thin in places. 

Maybe I need to rewatch the movie, or brush up on the previous ones to tie things together but what was motivating Safin when it came to the virus? Did he just want money? Because everything else he did was motivated by revenge, and he seems to have more money than god already given his set up. Why did Safin seem obsessed with Madeline and Mathilde and then suddenly switch to not caring about them at all at the end? The movie felt like it was setting him up for some grand plan that never really materialized. The whole Safin character was a mess, and once he got seriously involved and we got to know more about him the movie kind of fell apart.",q3nxx2

Despite the film breaking some pretty big Bond tropes it still felt like a classic Bond film. The scale felt enormous. ~~Dr.N~~ Safin was finally that classic villain with a global plan and not something personal to Bond.

The Rami Malek/Lea Seydoux stuff also seemed weird. He saved her when she was like 10 and then... just left her there I guess? And then shows up 20 years later and is super in love with her??? It just felt like this was all driven by it being needed for the plot, not it actually making sense. In general the whole Rami Malek villain was weak writing.",q3nxx2

hfti6ze,"~Heavy spoilers~🍿
~Long Read~📖

I think the overall problem with this movie is that they are trying to pick up the pieces left behind from spectre, and none of whats in that movie landed or felt legitimate or earned. I Actually like Lea Seydoux as an actress who played Madeline and was excited that she was the new bond girl in spectre, but the execution of their love story was so contrived, that in the end I really didn't care or believe it was a legitimate romance. Even the people who made that movie knows what's wrong with it. Why would they double down on it? 

The writing and execution in the first quarter of the this movie was pretty good up to a point but the basis for the characters just weren't there for me, again cuz it so heavily relies on spectre. You could call this spectre 2 tbh
 
The concept of Bond having a child and the fact that it's a daughter on top of it Is actually a genius move as a concept on paper, its kinda like poetic justice for him. The idea that he has to really commit and care and actually be responsible for someone more than yourself. Having that character be his daughter could have been deeply profound in that way. They could have also addressed his relationship with women through the daughter character. That would be addressing the misogyny and faults in his character. Maybe even could address the vesper Lind history that made Bond unable to commit to any real relationships with women because of how his heart was basically ripped out of his chest by Vesper. I'll give Daniel Craig this, he knocked it out of the park with this movie in terms of his acting, especially in a few key scenes. He made me really feel like he realises his life has just turned upside down the moment he saw his daughters eyes. He genuinely made me tear up couple times in the film if I'm being honest. Any scene with Bond and his daughter was elevated by Craig's acting, and almost made up for some of the lackluster writing in the film. He made me really feel Bonds urgency and angst from her safety being in jeopardy. The daughter aspect, if it was utilised more and written better, could have had the potential to make this something really special and powerful. You could potentially really disect Bond through the daughter character, break his character down, address his issues and still feel like everything organically came together, cuz there could be a central focal point for it all, his new daughter. Come to think of it, it's actually not that dissimilar to the concept of what they did for wolverine in Logan. 

Ok...Ana de armas was a total smoke show in this role! Holy hell she was good. Her character was badass, playful and intrigueing and that made her even sexier. I didn't think she could get more attractive but this role definitely did it. She should have been Bonds sidekick throughout the movie and become friends with him instead, moving away from a potentially cliched romance. Maybe there could have been a throughline in the film with him becoming sort of her mentor along the way since he's pretty much the most seasoned agent and she's insecure with how good she is. You can even still have the ""saying no"" scene later in the movie as their partnership grows and maybe some awkwardness leading to a back and forth conversation. Maybe he tells her about Vesper. Wnatever. Something like that would have felt organic, served as character development for Bond and some more three-dimensional depth to her character. Makes the ""saying no"" moment maybe actually mean something in the movie rather than a throwaway comedic jab at Bonds character.

LaShawna Lynch was fine. The hate for this movie for her being 007 and ppl just assuming that this is more of her movie than James bonds or she's taking power away from Bond and she's taking over, screw feminism, PC agenda pushing bitches, etc etc... I never subscribed to any of that nonsense. It's almost like people are trained and groomed these days to react like that without ever giving anything a chance....hey wait a minute🤔. I like her as an actress, was looking forward to see her performance. Problem is I never understood her character's initial hostility with Bond, I was like why is she going undercover and manipulating him into bringing her back to his place just to stick it to him and show him up. Could of had the same conversation in a different way maybe in a conventional way, idk doesn't matter. I have a feeling that her character doesn't like Bond for his history of misogyny and filandering, but nothing about him as an agent. So the writers prolly decided they should have her characters main reason for not liking bond to actually be a general critique of men in society??? not cuz she has a grudge against him, or he always sucked at his job, or from some personal altercation with him. That's the type of shoehorning of PC agendas that sane ppl of the audience are talking about. Give her a real reason not to like Bond and you can still have her give him shit about his relationship with women. Also you'd think they would have just started out as platonic competition instead of trying to one up and literary sabotage each other's missions when they both have literally the same goal, especially when the stakes are potentially so high. You think maybe she would look up to bond a little, wouldn't the new agents and recruits look up to bond? Wouldn't they all want to secretly be like him, not as a person, but as an agent? Since when is going by the book and putting down your legendary predecessors an interesting character trait. Aren't you supposed to like her by the end of the movie? They didn't give any real scene or event that gets them to respect each other to follow through on squashing the animosity, so what was the whole point? At least Naomi Harris's character didn't have all this nonsense. No newcomer is just going to give a middle finger to the previous guy when he's freaking James Bond, he should be a legend amongst new agents. This whole thing of Bond being out of his time and too old was addressed in Skyfall and spectre so that stuff felt tired. I have no problem with the ideals that were being pushed to be PC and give Bond some me too'ing, but the execution is too forced. At least itsl not as bad as Disney's Star wars tho. There is a way to do this people, organically, where it doesn't feel like a soapbox.

Side note, felt the action was a bit underwhelming in this movie. It peaked with the scene in the first half with that goon shooting away at Madeline's window in the car and James just letting it happen while he deliberates wether to trust her or not. Great Bond moment and was narratively creative. This whole scene is totally Bond and badass. You believe Bond would be an asshole and do something like that. For the most part though this series has lost its edge especially in the action scenes, starting with some parts of Skyfall and heavily with spectre. They just came across as made to look pretty and expensive and putting more effort into the camera work trying to get everything in one one shots rather than making the action actually exciting. You guys remember the parkour scene leading to the shootout at the embassy in Casino Royale?! Those action scenes have so much edge to them, you feel the danger bond is in. Editing is one of the most important components to action scenes and these just feel like constantly unnecessary long takes. Now we even have parts  where he is just walking right out in the open, firing his gun vaguely in bad guys direction, on a set that probably costed 1/4 of the movies budget. Even holding his gun from the hip at times and still casually just hitting his mark every time. All the while with the bond theme blaring in the background. Did the same thing in spectre at the desert scene. Just seemed like a total waste and honestly a bit lazy. The SUV Chase was ok I guess but it has Bond literally nudging his car into the bad guys cars just once and they go flying in to some convenient obstacle or hit a ramp that launches them into a flip. A lot of the action is like this and it comes off as just lazy even though they spend hundreds of millions of dollars making these movies.

All that being said I didn't hate the movie, if you watch it just as a spy drama it's not that bad. I didn't get bored really that much even tho it's almost 3 hrs. So take that for what it's worth. There's annoying bits of comedy and one liners that come off as awkward rather than funny. Always thought that kind of stuff didnt fit for Craig's films. Rami Malek was good, but underrutilized. His characters ultimate goal was not really clearly defined, at least to me, but I think he served his purpose in the movie. Nothing more nothing less. For me I didn't mind bond dieing, and the film for the most part earned it, was done decently enough.

It's certainly better than quantum of solace and spectre. A serviceable end to Daniel Craig's era. Although, I have noticed things about these last 3 films and they make me feel that ever since The Dark Knight came out, the people behind these films have been trying to copy Chris Nolan's aesthetics, that should stop. But that's a whole nother conversation.

hg1qc1c,"I posted my initial thoughts earlier, but having had a few more hours to digest as a huge Bond fan who has seen every movie and read every Fleming novel multiple times:

1. I hate the ending. HATE it. Bond just doesn’t actually die. I sat in my car in the parking lot for about 15 minutes after trying to wrap my head around it. My theory is that Daniel pitched it… “don’t give me another fucking chance to play this role again.” Now an obvious full reboot is coming and this was kind of a lazy way to get there. In retrospect, couldn’t believe I didn’t see it coming giving the numerous OHMSS references before it. 

2. Safin is an awful villain. Almost no screen time (in a 2hr45min movie!) and very little explanation of his scheme. I understand that Rami Malek is a big name now, but trotting him out in the press alongside Daniel is almost comical given how little he’s in the film.

3. I hated that they killed Felix. Felix is about the closest thing Bond has ever had to a friend. Recalled Mathis getting killed in QoS, albeit better handled.

4. Loved just about everything else. The pre-title sequence was fresh and different (kind of spooky!), the score is great (and I don’t particularly love Zimmer), and even though most of the Craig Bonds have been “And This Time It’s Personal™️” this one actually felt like it. I also loved the set design - so many locations felt real!

5. People are saying they don’t really buy the connection between Bond and Madeline. I’m fine with it. It didn’t seem any less earned than Tracy in OHMSS.",q3nxx2
hg2xy6y,"It was truly a popcorn film and when it started I hadn't realized how much I missed Bond movies.  Ultimately I was a bit frustrated with this movie.  

Why does Craig need a send off? Something I appreciated about the previous passing of the torches was how unceremoniously they were.  Craig's tenure was great but to be honest it was hit miss hit miss hit.  What do we gain by killing him off other than confusion about how the series will continue. I see 3 different possibilities: Nomi is the new 007, another series reboot with a new Bond to negate the death, or a throwback period piece.  My favorite option would be the latter.  How fun would it be to see a Bond movie in the 60s again?  Bulky gadgets, great outfits, cold war, etc.  One thing that sucks about new Bond movies is how easy the tech is.  Smartphones, the internet, fucking nanobots... not fun at all.",q3nxx2

I feel like they went really hard trying to soften Bond and while I liked this idea I thought at times it felt really heavy handed. 

Ana de Armas was a lot of fun but I left asking why she was even in the film. 

The fact that the white guy who was working with Safin would eventually turn on everyone felt telegraphed from the moment we saw him. He was so out of place in terms of look, dress, and demeanor I knew immediately he was gonna double cross.

This final bout, to me, is the closest Craig’s run as Bond has mirrored DR. NO… while still being so uniquely the British Bulldog we’ve come to expect. Still bummed that they went with “what’s-his-face” over Radiohead for SPECTRE. I’m curious to see what Villeneuve does with Bond, if given the chance. Just go see it already. And I don’t understand why people are considering this one to be so controversial. Also - If anything, this film could have used more Ana de Armas. Enjoy!
I’d like to see a young Felix spinoff with Michael B Jordan. Or a spinoff with Armas. Loved the foggy forest sequence. Found Bond’s end to be fitting. I didn’t find any of the choices to be controversial. It all worked. Am I crazy or did Q say he has a guy coming over? Would have preferred a film focused on Bond teaming up with the CIA and Armas.

hk4im6h,"So why did Valdo lie to Primo? and why was Primo surprised about the spectre killing?

I must have missed something.

* You see Valdo being instructed to lie to Primo, by Safin on the phone, as Primo firsts invade the heracles facility.

Now I guess you ""could"" explain those things with Primo not yet being recruited by Safin, or just keeping the other Spectre agents in the dark.. But then again. I'm assuming that Safin got all his Spectre intel through Primo, or else how did he know step by step what was going to happen in the Heracles facility? So at this point Primo was allready recruited by Safin.  


Now this next part I cant really explain with 'keeping Spectre in the dark'

&#x200B;

* Moments before the spectre party, Valdo is alone with Primo, both at this point being recruited by Safin, yet they still keep this facade and Valdo even makes an effort to swap USB without Primo seeing it.  
But literally nothing was at stake in that scene, they both had the same purpose.
* When instead of James Bond, Spectre people starts being killed by Heracles, you see Primo clearly confused looking distressed from side to side only to rush out the room, like he had no idea this was gonna happen?  


We allready know that Primo had met up with Ash long before the SPectre party, so this is confusing to me.",q3nxx2
hkfro54,"Seemed far more comedic then any other of the Daniel Craig films. Not neccesarily a bad thing but something I definitely noticed.

I felt like the writing/story was all over the place. I was hoping this movie would have been about the final confrontation with Blofeld and Spectre, and damn was that anti climatic lol...
I said out loud ""whait this is it?"". Like all these previous movies they have been making led to this moment, and we barely get 5 minutes to watch it (which again, did not feel fulffilling at all), to make the movie go ""that's that, now focus on this new villain who has no real motive or plan at all he follows for Longer then 1 minute"". Even the face off between bond and the new villain was pretty meh.

Apart from the story/writing it was filmed in top Quality like i would expect from a Bond movie, so that atleast was nice.

icwaxa4,While good imo the last 40 or so minutes seemed like a video game in m was telling bond what to do.,q3nxx2
hftqlxh,"I really liked this. Miles better than Spectre. 

The action was absolutely stellar. Each scene was a new high for the franchise. From the opening to the end fight on the stairwell. The car chases were beautiful, again a high for the series. 

I like that Barbara Broccoli followed through on what she said a few years ago about the next 007 being a black woman. Brilliant stuff. I really liked Nomi and Bond's dynamic, I wish it got more time. Ana De Armas is a stealth MVP of this movie IMO, her character was a breath of fresh air and I wish was a bigger part of the movie. 

I bought Madeline and Bond's romance a little more this time around, and I liked that it started with Bond addressing his trauma from Vesper's death. I wish Craig had gotten more time to deal with that, but it makes sense that Bond was ready to move on and no longer linger on his past. 

The idea of Bond having a daughter is awesome and it's a shame we won't be getting to see what 00-Dad looks like. 

Q, M, and Moneypenny were great as always. 

I'm really glad I watched a lot of 60's Bond because otherwise a lot of the references would've been lost on me. Louis Armstrong returning to the franchise made me smile. It was a beautiful moment. 

My only real misgiving is that I wish there was one more movie between Spectre and NTTD. I think that could have helped really bring everything together, but DC was already 36 (maybe even 38) when he started as Bond so it makes sense he was on borrowed time. 

I think it also did something really cool as an interpretive thing. The ending with Madeline telling their daughter that she's going to tell her a story about a man named ""Bond, James Bond"" made me think that now Madeline is going to tell her about the earlier Eon movies as fictitious stories about her father, while the reboot timeline is what the real story of James Bond. It doesn't entirely work as a theory because it means that she also tells her stories that feature other women, but either way I think it's a fun idea. 

A fitting end to an incredible ride. I honestly never thought it would end this way, but I'm glad it did. 

Also, I drank my first Vodka martini tonight. 

8/10",q3nxx2
hh07jn9,"Not sure how I feel about the ending, James literally dying to a missile strike, I understand they had to find an exit for Craig but I didn't think it would actually kill him off. I also thought the daughter thing was meh at first, but then I thought it was a bit of an interesting angle, giving the character an element to his life he's never had in any of the other movies.

That being said the opening scene and the Aston Martin burnout of death was incredible. One of the best opening in the franchise and pure 007 badassery. When they are trying to break the glass and Jame is simply sitting there, knowing nothing will touch him is peak bond coolness.

Overall, I enjoyed this one, though I can understand why some might not. Fukunaga did a great job. That one-shot scene was amazing.

My ranking of Craig's run:

1: Casino Royale/Quantum of Solace (they're a package deal for me)

2: Skyfall

3: No Time

4: Spectre

I wish they hadn't pushed the ""Bond is an old man"" angle in Skyfall. That could've been more appropriate in Spectre or this one. While we're wishing for things, more standalone films for Craig would've been cool, but hopefully the next Bond will have more individual mission movies and not another interconnected series.",q3nxx2

A lot of things weren’t clear but at the same time Bond could’ve escaped, been quarantined, and lived the rest of his life on a island like he did in Skyfall.

By the way, he totally wasn’t as fit as he was in the previous movies. His suits were way too tight and I think they barely showed his beer belly.",q3nxx2

All the characters were great except for the main villain, whose intent seemed to go from getting revenge on spectre to killing millions of people for no clear reason. Blofeld seemed kind of a waste as well.

hfz8yhv,"I guess I watched a different movie than most people because I walked out very disappointed. I've read some of the comments here and they flesh out some of my problems, but I still can't help feeling let down. 

The good:

The directing was incredible as was the DP. Some of the most iconic shots of the entire Bond series. 

The acting was excellent generally across the board. 

Everyone looks great. Costuming is excellent. 

Supporting cast is excellent. I love Naomie Harris and the =

The bad:

The plot is horrible and convoluted. The love story seems shoehorned. Felix is underused and his death seems cheap. Another poster suggested that his death should have been the main motivation and I agree. The villain's motivations are unclear and he is woefully underused. It feels like Malik is in the film for like 15 minutes. 

And, Bond dies. This is a cardinal sin for me. I grew up on Bond movies in the era of Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and Pierce Brosnan. But I've watched them all. The great thing about Bond is that he, uh...finds a way. I think taking that from this Bond is a tragedy. But maybe these movies just aren't for me anymore. I was happy to entertain a more gritty Bond and I thought Casino Royale was excellent even though it struggled with the third act. 

But they've generally gotten progressively worse in the Craig era. I'm all for gritty, but I don't want Bond to be Jason Bourne or John Wick. We have those movies. I didn't like the stairwell to the control room gunfight for that reason. It's technically incredible, but it just didn't feel like Bond to me. 

The humor was generally a miss for me. The 007 jokes just went on too long. 

The action set pieces were average for me. I like when an action sequence feels like it ""comes together,"" if that makes sense. Almost like a puzzle that Bond solves. The opening of Casino Royale, the fight at the airport, these were fantastic and clever. I feel like a lot of the cleverness is gone with this Bond in favor of gritty action. Again, there's plenty of movies that do that but what makes Bond Bond isn't that. At least for me.",q3nxx2
hggijn6,"Man, there was so much in NTTD that was just brilliant. The Felix Leiter arc, the Blofeld interrogation, Rami Malek, the opening sequence, the callbacks to older Bond films

But is it just me or did the ending feel…uncharacteristic and unfulfilling? Especially after what was a great 2 and a half hours. I mean, I get that it was established this would be Daniel Craig’s last Bond movie, but James Bond is an escape artist. That’s his thing. And he’s just gonna stand there for 10 minutes and get blown up for…some reason? I think it would’ve been more fitting if they showed the missiles blowing the island up and then panned down to show Bond rowing off in a boat as the theme played.

Bond has NEVER done that. As a review for Skyfall mentioned years ago, Bond doesn’t speak much words…he speaks through his actions.

Malek is underutilized.

But still there's a lot to like in No time to Die. The action sequences are slick especially that Norway chase/hunt. Ana de Armas has a fun extended cameo, Seydoux and Craig are reliable as always. 163 minutes passed quite easily and teared up a bit during the send off.",q3nxx2

1. Safin letting Mathilde go- i thought he would need her to leverage bond still, it seems like that was his point like, to kill bond. So it was a little questionable for me to see him let the child go after she bites him.

2. Also Mathilde's Dou Dou - like what does this symbolize? that he has a part of his daughter when he dies, i just don't see why they didn't just have Mathilde find it. Before the ending scene i really thought they would make the audience believe he was dead, but then we see dou dou in Madeleine's house. (that would've been a sick ending) 

3. I feel like Nomi was just there to idk—she could've gotten a better story... like she just exists to add on to James's story, I hope we get to see her in the next movies.

4. Leiter dying? I feel like this really didn't progress that plot, Bond still would've gone after Safin and Blofeld regardless of his death. His cigar, him not getting to smoke it feels like a waste to the scene, I know him dying is a bit of a reference to the title/ theme that this is Craig's last film, therefore we must include death as main theme, but c'mon.

5. Paloma was a nice touch, and I hope that they include her in the next James Bond movies.

6. I get that Bond's death is meant to be heroic and fitting for the character but, I felt meh about him dying. During the whole saying goodbye thing, I kept thinking how dramatic this scene is, I found it a bit funny.

7. M saying that we don't have the authorization to bomb, but then in the next scene he now has control over it?

8. Also I feel like we could see Logan Ash again? this sounds stupid but, we didn't get to see his body, so... 

I still like and enjoyed this movie; the fight scenes were great.",q3nxx2
hkma3tm,"Just watched the film, and....

Sad to see the Bond of our era go(90s-2000s kids)

Contrary to others, I liked Rami Malek in the villain role(watched Mr.Robot and was pumped to know he was the villain in NTTD, wasn't disappointed)

Madeleine looked more.....human as compared to Spectre 

Bond uses a Nokia 3310 3G(nice phone)

Looks like Q retook the Cybersecurity course during the interval of 8-9 years 

Blofeld is cocky as ever 

And am I the only one who noticed that Craig talks a lot in this particular film than the others?

Overall, 10/10

It felt like it came out of nowhere, where nobody else in the movie made comments on nationality, ethnicity or race at any point and then finally at the end of the movie the writers decided this one Russian white dude needs to make a casually racist comment to the black woman.

The movie was fine except for the story, which never made any sense. They have all this money to make the film but can't figure out how to write a good story. Craig and Seydoux were excellent. So was Armas, Wright and the dude from Game Night. Everyone else was fine.

hg7keb1,"Craig had 3/5 solid films as Bond and I'm pretty thankful that his reboot did as well as it did. 

The writing in 2 & 4 made it abundantly clear that there wasn't a clear plan (a'la Marvel's meteoric ascent) to really make each film matter in the grand scheme of things (shoutout to Mission Impossible lately, who have similarly killed it). 

I think this film was a bold **good**bond film and neatly wrapped up what Casino Royale and Skyfall set out to do. Unfortunately it hits the pitfalls of 2 & 4 with a villain who we can't quite comprehend and, generally, fails to deliver an interesting story outside of This Is The Last D. Craig Bond Film (which it does super well!). 

All of those bits aside -- I enjoyed the hell out of it. I think when watched as a 1,3,5 series it is fantastic!

Other thoughts (spoilers all)


>!I think Ana de Armas stole the entire show and I really did expect her to come back.<!

>!I wish Léa Seydoux had spent a little less time on camera **literally just crying and being emotionally wracked** -- let her have a moment or two outside of this emotion. I felt like every other scene had her crying. Give her more time to explore her relationship with her kid, with the estranged father of her child who she hid from him, anything. The movie is already nearly 3 hours so give her five minutes, please.!<

>!Felix went out dirty and I do wish they had given him a little more room in the film. I get that they need to tie up a bunch of characters for the next slate but it still left me bummed.!<

>!Considering the entire film, perhaps the first act (up to meeting new 007) felt a tiny bit bloated? I'd have to watch again, but considering how much happens in this film I'd argue we should spend more time with Madeleine.!<

>!I still literally have zero idea what Safin wanted to do other than ""nefarious shit"" -- this reminded me of Craig Bond episodes 2 & 4 -- there is a villain and they're going to do bad stuff, but outside of ""lots of dead people"" it really never made sense to me. I could have missed it I have a small, smooth brain. He also is shown to be like... a mega-mastermind since he kills the entirety of Spectre (Specter?) but I don't actually know why he did that? Was it all just to fuck up Craig-Bond's life? I don't fucking get it.!<

>!Supporting cast was super great, I wish Nu-007-but-not-007 (Lashauna Lynch) was given a win or two on screen, as it was she basically seemed like a slightly incompetent agent and that undermines a whole lot of what being a '00' has meant for the series as a whole.!<


For me overall --   
NTtD was a 8/10 bond film 
Casino Royale remains a solid 9 or 9.5/10  
Skyfall was elevated to a solid 9/10 due to character performances and a big bucking of some expectations of a bond film.

A whole lot of this film oozed old Bond energy, especially OHMSS. 

There were moments where Craig’s acting was so different and more emotional than the Bond we have gotten for the past few films that it threw me off a bit before I settled into his (mostly offscreen during that 5 year time span) character development. 

Overall can’t wait to watch it again which I will likely be doing this week. I really liked it and would probably rank it as #3 in my Craig era list; behind Casino and Skyfall.

It had maybe the best execution I've ever seen in any film of very simple scenarios like one person shooting their way from point A to point B. The choreography of the staircase scene near the end was incredible.  But none of the deaths, including Bond, held any gravitas to me. I think it was a mistake on the writers part to give a sense of finality to a series developed around an idea of a person rather than an actor playing a person. I was reminded of 'Person of Interest' where the unstoppable agent in the end could only be killed by a strike they ordered themselves.

After they went bananas finally getting to use Spectre and Blofeld in the previous film, they put a quiet nail in the coffin of all that leaving behind a whole lot of wasted potential.

I am glad the movie was not too 'woke' with all the current aspects of social zeitgeist.  All the elements were easy to go along with.  Albeit that some people will complain even when being chauffeured in a Rolls, this film rocked.

Why did Safin want to kill billions?  Because he is a megalomaniac.  It's part of the shtick.

hft36qx,"Marking the end of an era, No Time to Die is the type of Bond film that is going to split people. Some will love the bold choices and decisions it makes, while others will detest and say it ruins what they loved about Bond. I fall more on the positive side, although for the most part I’d say it was an easy and entertaining watch compared to something like Spectre, despite some flaws in the execution and familiar Bond tropes we’ve all seen.

Daniel Craig is really giving it all here with his performance. He knows it’s his final outing as Bond and he is what makes the emotional beats work. He gets a few funny lines here too. The supporting cast from previous Bond films get to do more here, and it’s shot pretty well in terms of action and never feels dull. The score by Hans Zimmer is pretty good too. Only thing I’m not sure is if the logic behind the story makes sense, but a lot of Bond stuff falls under that issue and sometimes you just gotta look past it and not get too nitpicky.

Honestly, no Bond film is perfect, and it’s usually the writing/plotting that drags it down. The first half feels very different to what we get in the second, and Rami Malek is not given enough screentime to really shine as a memorable Bond villain. He seems to be inspired by Dr. No, but most of the film feels like No Time to Die ends up tying pretty much every loose end and referencing all previous Bond movies in some way. Blofeld is back too and his scenes work better here than what he was doing in Spectre for the most part.

The big plus that pushes this up a notch from most Bond movies for me is the ending. If you can get an emotional response/reaction out of the entire audience, then I think that’s a pretty big deal that deserves some credit and praise. It’s going to piss off some people, but I completely understand why they went with it and it and I suppose they wanted to leave Craig’s tenure as Bond with a bang. Where things will go from here on out I don’t know, but we’ll see in the future.

In the end, I suspect No Time to Die will be considered either the best or worst of James Bond. The film has been referred to as “The Last Jedi of Bond movies” and it’s probably not too far off from the truth. Comparing it to Craig’s other films, it falls right in the middle sandwiched between his very best and very worst for me. There’s definitely an On Her Majesty’s Secret Service feel to it, and I suspect the response will be polarising. In the end, I’m glad Craig ended on a good note (well I think he did anyways). 7/10",q3nxx2
hg5mcmk,"**THEORY:** the original Bond films (pre-Daniel Craig) are all just stories that Madeline tells her daughter, starting at the end of No Time to Die.

**Let me explain:** we know that the order in which the 25 Bond films were made does not follow the order in which Ian Flemming’s novels were written. The first film featuring Daniel Craig – Casino Royale – is actually the first of Ian Flemming's novels, which introduced James Bond to the world in 1953. This establishes that the Daniel Craig series is meant to represent a kind of beginning that takes us deeper into the character's past. 

This is reinforced in the Daniel Craig series by how M, Q, and Moneypenny – the only permanent character fixtures across all the films – are represented. Q is young not old in this series; James ""meets"" Moneypenny for the first time in this series. Most entertaining, at the end of Skyfall we see Daniel Craig entering a wood-paneled office of a male M, and having an exchange about M's injured arm – all recurrently familiar to us from the historical Bond films. M, Q, and Moneypenny are our guideposts to film chronology, and the ending of Skyfall is therefore clearly meant to align that film to the beginning of the James Bond story arc. This is the beginning. The challenge though, is that a prominent sub-theme across the Daniel Craig films is that the character is getting old, he's not as sharp as he used to be, and much closer to retirement than to the start of a career. So how could this be the beginning if it already feels like the end?

In comes No Time to Die. This is \[SPOILER\] definitively the ""end"" of James Bond, as we see him die on the island.  The final scene of NTTD is of Madeline and her (and James') daughter driving the same windy road seen earlier in the film. Madeline turns to her daughter and says she wants to tell her a story of a man named ""Bond, James Bond"" before entering a darkened tunnel made to evoke the iconic down-the-barrel eagle eye view. The tales of James Bond are only now about to be told.

So how are we meant to understand this? The Daniel Craig series is the beginning AND the end of James Bond. All the other non-Daniel Craig films (Connery, Lazenby, Moore, Dalton, \[Brosnan\*\]) are just the stories Madeline invents for her daughter about the ""legend of James Bond,"" her father. 

The only ""M"" that Madeline knows is a man, hence her stories feature M as a man. The Q she knows is young and at the start of his career, hence he gets older as her stories progress. In No Time to Die, we see Madeline being exposed to events and scenes that form the basis of her storytelling – a magic car that can withstand bullets and has a switchboard full of tricks, a derelict nuclear / submarine base that serves as the bad guy's evil lair, a vehicle that's both a plane and submersible. She already knows about Spectre and through her trusted access as Blofeld's psychiatrist, undoubtedly also absorbed all there is to know about his relationship to James Bond, enough to set him up as the prime archnemesis in her stories. 

All of this serves as the source material for Madeline's invented (and exaggerated) storytelling. In fact the events of some of the historical Bond films are sometimes so over-the-top (ex. Moonraker) that they actually sound more like a child's bedtime story, than a real-world telling. This is in contrast to the Daniel Craig films which feature these elements, but in a more muted, realistic way. 

It's said that every person dies twice – the first time is when they truly pass away, the second time is when people stop telling stories about them. James Bond is dead, so it makes sense that Madeline would want to keep him alive – through storytelling – for James' daughter to remember and know him. In another one of No Time to Die's final scenes, M recites a quote that appears in Ian Flemming's You Only Live Twice novel. Indeed, James Bond does get to live twice. Daniel Craig's films are James Bond's life as it was, all other films are James Bond's legend as they were told.

\*NOTE: Since the Brosnan and Daniel Craig films commonly feature the same female M (Judi Dench), and if M is a chronology guidepost, an argument could be made that the Brosnan films should be grouped together with Daniel Craig's.",q3nxx2
hgh4h11,"Very disappointed.

James Bond does not give up, but in this movie he did.

Blofeld tricked Bond into distrusting Madeline, thus depriving him of 5 years of happiness.  Bond didn't try to find the truth, he just trusted the information he had.  Fool me once, shame on me.

Who is to say that Safin did not pull the same trick?  Tell Bond that he can't ever touch Madeline or his daughter, when it is not true?  Bond could get tested before believing him, but he just gave up.  

Q said there was no way to reverse it.  Today.  Why couldn't Bond go back to his island retreat for a year and give Q time to find a cure, instead of just giving up?  Zooming with his new family every day.

hfwdnzb,"No Time To Die was exceedingly long and you could feel it.

The problem is that the film felt like it was just jumping from one action sequence to the next. Non of the action sequences were anywhere near as iconic as the ones in either Casino Royale, Skyfall or the opening sequence in Spectre.

Rami Malek wasn't great as the villain. He seemed to just ramble on about some complete nonsense. Thoroughly unmemorable Bond villain. The mere five minutes Christopher Waltz was onscreen completely blew Malek's performance out of the water.

I didn't feel much of an emotional connection to Bond's girlfriend in the film. Their relationship didn't come close to the chemistry Bond had with Vesper. I didn't care much for the kid either. It never really felt like that child was in real danger

Bond's death also felt rather anti-climactic. A true heroes ending but just kind of bland.

They also kept forcing the word 'time' in to the dialogue. The film's plot really had nothing much to do with time. There were many 'character alludes to name of the movie' moments.

I realise lots of reviewers are beside themselves over this movie. But I can't help feeling this is another case where they are wrong.

I will mention some positives. Craig was thoroughly great in the role, truly end of an era. Ana De Armas was a sight to behold and great in the 'Bond girl' role even though it was only fleeting.

I grew up with this Bond as did many others, my mom grew up with Sean Connery’s bond and she always talked about how much she enjoyed his run growing up. Together we started watching the pierce Bronson bond movies together and they were fun but never great. We both fell in love with Daniel Craigs portrayal.

* Man was the Russian scientist awful.  
* Like Spectre, I wish we got to see more of Blofeld / Christoph Waltz. I still feel he was underutilized - more so in Spectre since he was behind bars in NTTD.   
* I liked Lea Seydoux, but Eva Green was so fantastic that the bar was set at the highest level possible for Bond's woman. I just wasn't sold on the Bond and Madeleine relationship as a result. Same goes for their kiddo.  
* Ana de Armas was a breath of fresh air with good energy, but I think she's a bit blown up.

Action scene in the foggy forest and the staircase stood out the most to me. Along with the entire Cuba sequence. Ana De Armas is an absolute gem, and just insanely gorgeous, her three kill of the henchmen was great especially.

Rami Malek was good, but yeah his genoicde motivation was a little what?

Blofeld's one little bit here was better than all of Spectre. Also loved him seeming mad talking in his cell but actually communicating with Spectre. His birthday party with the eye on the tray being carried around was the perfect amount of silly to me.

The finale was pretty great, I genuinely got quite emotional when Bond realised he could never see his wife and daughter again and then accepting death. A proper send off, maybe the only one in the entire series really.

Also all of spectre dieing in 1 room was stupid made no sense.  This movie felt like metal gear not bond. Also the villain was doing MI6 work for them by wiping out spectre. So how is he the bad guy again? Why did the villain turn off the machine himself and not send one of his henchmen? Did they all die? But he had bodyguards the last scene. Also why didn't he just leave? Why was he so obsessed with madeline? Why was he so lame? Why are all the villains disfigured?  Also why did they need to airstrike the island at that exact moment? There was no time limit so why not launch the missiles when bond is clear?,q3nxx2
hjzd8r7,"That ending was so bad. Bond going from headshoting people coming at him from all directions and surviving point-blank grenades  to being sneaked on by the cripple villain  in an open massive room.

The whole plot was a mess honestly.",q3nxx2
hfuch9b,"It's such a disappointment to end a series like that when they started it with Casino Royale. No Time to Die looks like it's a fanfiction script by some 15 year old with a hero fantasy brought to life by a sportscars advertisement director. The Craig era started with an MI6 operator going after an accountant playing the stock market, it ends with nanobots and a villain that has no apparent motive (he wanted to get revenge from Spectre, got it, great, and then what the fuck was the nanobots farm for?). Also some clowny russian (?) racist scientist that has no depth as a character.



They want us to believe the main stake of this movie is the relationship between Bond and Madeleine. Craig and Seydoux have zero chemistry. It's painfully hard to believe in any interest between the characters in any scene they have together. Craig had more chemistry with De Armas in the 5/10 minutes they spend together than with the TWO freaking movies he had with Seydoux. The villain is like a Fast and Furious trope with an evil lair and some sci-fi base and family history. Who the fuck writes a ""family of poisonners"" in a Craig Bond movie?



Most of the plot advances through three mechanisms : 1) Characters don't communicate crucial informations 2) Villain does things that have no sense (dropping the child that he wanted as family legacy and leaving it wandering through the complex and she magically finds her way back). Both of these mechanisms are the sign of weak and lazy writing. And 3) Use of sci-fi technology imagined by a teenager. Examples : BIONIC EYE. What the fuck? Blofeld is supposed to be in prison, scanned, his every movement monitored, and OH SORRY WE DIDN'T CHECK HE HAD A BIONIC EYE THAT CAN TRANSMIT DATA THROUGH HIS HIGHLY TECHNOLOGICALLY SECURED CELL TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD. Jesus that movie was dumb. DNA nanobots, THAT ARE NOT AFFECTED BY THE EMP WATCH. EMP watch that AFFECTS THE FREAKING BIONIC EYE BUT NOT BONDS COMMS.



This movie made me so angry by its sheer stupidity and the waste of Craig's Bond which is for me the best itteration of the character, at least the one with the most depth to it.



I wish Quantum of Solace was directed and edited better, because i think those are its main flaws, and that they kept that direction of smaller, more ""reallistic"" villains. Because Spectre and No Time to Die really drove this franchise into the ground and it's a shame. Casino Royale wasn't perfect but it was so much simpler and efficient. I just feel there was the potential after Skyfall to close the Vesper/Spectre storyline and maybe try something different with the last movie in terms of what is at stake. No Time to Die looked like more like a Roger Moore Bond than a Craig one, with the added unbelievable and neverending romance.


Edit : added example for the villain doing stupid stuff.",q3nxx2
hftap3z,"I thought the movie was good in a vacuum... But I can't help but think that the whole philosophy around Daniel Craig's tenure is just never going to jive with me. The movies feel weaker the more they try to tie into an overall arc - whether the arc is specific plot components or even just an emotional arc... I think I just prefer the standalone nature of the old movies... I didn't need this movie to a serve as a 'bookend' to Daniel Craig's time as Bond.

 I know I would have enjoyed a version of this movie that didn't try to be that.

I'll always have my favorite older ones to revisit. glad others can enjoy these, but maybe I'm hitting a generational disconnect",q3nxx2
hg6fbwo,Remi Malik might be the weakest Bond villain ever,q3nxx2
hg7e3no,"I've sat on my thoughts on this film for a couple of days now since I saw it in the theater, to see if my feelings would change, but they haven't.  I loved this move, and unfortunately I feel this is one where I'm going to be in the minority in regards to what I feel and think about it.

The thing I have respected most about the Daniel Craig era of James Bond films, is that the stories seem to build off one another, they felt interconnected, despite the change in directors and other higher-up figures, each pass of the torch figure respected the work of those that came before, lines in the films that came prior came to have greater significance and weight, characters came to hold more impact in the story as time went on, and by and large, the majority of women of the Daniel Craig era shined through beyond being just sex pursuit symbols.  


By and large, there are 2 things, that come to my mind as to why many of the people whom dislike either as a whole or large swaths of No Time To Die, and the Daniel Craig era of James Bond films more broadly.  

&#x200B;

First is that they dislike that Bond was often made to feel truly human, and that he was allowed to go on a journey of growth and development that carried on film to film, and came to a head, to a conclusion, in No Time To Die.  Was he perfect by this last film, had he overcome all his flaws, demons, bad habits, etc, no, but there was a real sense, to me, of how as a person he had changed, how he had learned, and grown from the past.  

&#x200B;

The second thing, is that Daniel Craig's James Bond didn't feel like a caricature written by horny men in locker room.  Daniel Craig's James Bond was a flawed, multi-layered, a far deep character of this type, with far more depth then the often shallow puddle portrayals of the past.  The humor and sexual innuendo didn't hijack the character to the point of being ridiculous.  With that, there are going to be many whom won't like this film simply because it isn't an over the top fantasy escape outlet.  But for those out there like me, that don't go see most films looking for a fantasy escape, regardless of franchise history, but rather we go in looking to feel something, to have our mind light up like fireworks, and have our heart strings tugged on, to bring out a deeper emotional response, for those like that, like me, this film lived up to our hope for expectations.  


When I see this movie, I do love it as a stand alone film, but as with each new movie of the Daniel Craig James Bond era, I can't help but lump it together as a continuing story, a true evolving story that saw actions have consequences, puzzle pieces fall into place to build a fuller picture, and nuance and shades of grey come to make the characters in these films feel more real, more fully realized.  The Daniel Craig era is one that started with many doubting the choice of new lead actor, and ended with many people, new and old, coming to have a large sense of appreciation, and admiration for Daniel Craig, those that took the chance on him in this role, and on him insisting his iteration of James Bond, stay as grounded as possible, to us, the franchise is all the better for it.",q3nxx2
hjzxjv7,"His watch was a device for destroying electronics, which nanobots are.  Thought for sure they would do something with him not knowing he's infected, then using the watch at the last second to save them.  Such a good movie up until the end where it went fucking stupid.  
  
Also, why bother with the kid in the beginning getting a call to release the sheep?  Just have the sheep being herded along the street, it doesn't have to be part of some fucking master plot.",q3nxx2

hg4zlpc,"HOT TAKE:
Remi Malek was amazing in Bohemian Rhapsody and Mr. Robot. 

However, he was flat out not good in this role. In the limited screen time he had, he wasn’t particularly scary, intimidating, or smart, nor is it realistic the amount of resources and loyalty from all of his workers and army on the island. In the past 10 Bond films there hasn’t been a worse villain, even QoS. 

IMO he was cast on name, and was impressively disappointing. I was skeptical of him as the villain but never expected such a weak performance and over-acting every line.",q3nxx2

That’s my personal feeling. I also felt that the humour really wasn’t there in this film apart from literally a couple of moments.

Overall, my least favourite DC Bond film.",q3nxx2

hhc0993,"I really really hope someone on *Mock The Week* references Hugh Dennis's cameo in this film. 


Overall I thought it was a solid film with the expected cheese factored in and me skipping *Spectre*. Mathilde served as a new emotional core for James Bond, which I feel is a nice change of pace rather than This Film's Girl dying in a tragic stunt and Craig's Bond killing some people on her behalf or something while sad. For once his sacrifice is more than just for queen and country, it's to ensure Madeline and Mathilde survive. It helps me ignore the fact that we basically got to watch Rami Malek act like a very subtle weeb for 2.5 hours, if anything. 


I was a worried for a minute that Paloma would just be a dumb girl archetype, so it was a relief to see she could hold her own during the big SPECTRE fight. Same for Nomi, though I wish we got a little more about 007 2.0's adventures - it's clear she's competent, but we hear little more than ""I've been at this for two years"", though I may have zoned out a minute.

Danny Boyle was right and I left watching No Time to Die wanting to see what Danny would have done.

As most have said, the first hour up to Cuba sizzled (Ana de Armas was the highlight for me) but then it simply flatlined. A villain with confused motivation and a romance with zero chemistry. I was bored for the first time watching Craig as Bond and I left unsure I ever want to see it again. And I didn't even mind them killing him.

One major bugbear was how criminally wasted Moneypenny was. Let's face it Nomi (Lashana Lynch) didn't serve any other purpose other than transport Bond around so if the producers really cared about female representation Moneypenny was RIGHT THERE.

I loved Casino Royale, not just as a Bond film but as a classic actioner thanks to sizzling chemistry, great action and fantastic writing (all lacking in NTTD). No one can tell me any scene in NTTD compares favourably to that film's parkour or airport chases let alone the legendary [meeting of minds](https://youtu.be/xuyoqS31Yug) on a train.

This is ffing blofeld they have a great actor in waltz and they butchered him in these two movies.

Action seemed weirdly off for me, maybe hiding the fact craig is alot older now. And the chase scenes were subpar too. Weird because i still enjoyed the movie. Cinematography was amazing as always and the atmosphere and tension was great. The younger agents were pretty fun too even if one of them had great chemistry with bond but was in it for 5 minutes then gone. I wanted it to be amazing and it had the potential but too many weird decisions and motives that make no sense deus ex machina at its finest throughout the movie",q3nxx2
hg50g5i,"One part of the continuity that didn't make sense for me was the fact that bond had his nuts turned to mush in Casino Royale. Vesper says that he's more of a man than anyone else regardless... In my mind that was part of the reason he was such a womanizer, than he could never father children. 
But he has a kid.",q3nxx2
hg6yep7,"I thought it was good. Some of the action was really insane, way better than in the previous Bond movies. Nomi was alright, but the standout was Ana de Armas easily. I thought they might make Nomi overly serious to the point of being boring, but instead she has the same energy as Bond IMO, though not as brash obviously. That part where she said the title was cheesy, but well-deserved considering what the Russian was saying to her. Rami Malek should've had more of a presence in the movie, and it was never really clear what he wanted to do. Overall I think this is worth checking out, moreso than Venom 2 (despite that making a lot more money).",q3nxx2
hgcc7zu,"Morning-after thoughts: definitely reminded my of *Licence to Kill* in a few ways.

Plot-wise, Bond's not a Double-0 and revenge plays a large part of the plot. Also, Felix has a bad time.

Overall film ""feel"", it doesn't feel especially *Bond* (though more so than *Licence to Kill*), but still a damn good action/espionage film about revenge (and in this case, being an old solider, and family).

Then the ending is a hard one to swallow. They had to do this to introduce something fresh to the franchise. Daniel Craig has made it clear he is DONE with this franchise.

hftgen7,"The action and acting, good. Liked Ana's character, lot of fun. But the writing, bad.

There were no twists. After Saffin rescues Madeline... 20 years later... I was expecting some sleeper agent betrayal where she would choose Saffin over Bond. Nope. When James goes to choke Blofeld I thought they were going to have some secret exchange or teamwork. Nope.

The villain didn't feel threatening at all. I mean he kills a drunk woman and then gets almost taken out by a 10 year old. His motivation is as generic as it comes. Saffin really could have used some flashbacks to develop his character, or show the garden scene earlier and have him use poisons as a weapon. The sitdown between Saffin and Bond was completely forgettable and almost cringeworthy when Bond starts ""apologizing"". 

The final confrontation was bland and pointless. Saffin walks off with his goons and I'm expecting a nanobot launch against the nations of the world, but there wasn't even a threat explained. All he does is let the daughter go, then close the blast doors that Bond just opened, then shoot Bond a couple times. I wanted to laugh there. It completely cheapened Bond's stairwell fight. Where are the stakes? You have the world and the daughter as hostage... and you let one go free and don't even threaten the other. 

Then he poisons Bond with the anti-madeline nanobots... when he's already dying or will die to the incoming missles. There's no emotional effect there. They should have given Bond the opportunity to escape, then make the decision to stay on the island as death is preferable to putting madeline/daughter at risk. He could have sent them the rabbit doll or something instead of saving himself.",q3nxx2

I really loved it - it's a movie for patient and attentive viewers, and it rewards you for doing so. Some plot holes but not enough to mess the flow of the film which was fine. I'd say it's either slightly behind Skyfall or tied with Skyfall for 2nd best Bond film (first being CR) for me. The scene with the landcruiser was one of my absolute favorites of the series, and the camerawork was magnificent especially in the staircase shootout. 

My biggest qualm is I wish they brought back the bulldog at the very end, and that Bond mentioned that Dou Dou was waiting with him when he was talking to Madeline. But that's mainly because I'm a masochist and that would have made me cry harder...

I have trouble getting into Bond movies because of how protected the character is. These movies really broke that down.

* They introduced Waltz' Blofeld in Spectre, but didn't do much with much with him -- only to kill him off in this movie. Such a waste of a great villain. 

* They killed off Felix Leiter, a character that's been part of the franchise since the first book in 1953.

* And they bloody went and killed off James Bond (after handing the 007 title to a black girl, no less). 

------------------------------------------

This has become like so many modern ""remakes"" -- The JJ Abrams Star Trek, the Star Wars sequels, etc. 

These ""modern"" film makers are like toddlers that's been handed something precious, and the best idea they can come up with is ""let's smash it"". Fuck 'em.

hftsncs,"Not that great imo.

Way too long, and a lot of setups that didn't have payoffs (the cigar for example).

I felt the comedy came off a bit cheesy and was a bit jarring at times in relation to the flow of the rest of the story which was really fucking somber.

The villain was waaaay underdeveloped, which is a shame because his portrayal by Rami was pretty good.  

Female 007 had absolutely no impact on the story, and I feel was there to hit the diversity checkbox.  She didn't save James once or play an integral role in stopping the bioweapon.  She left the island when shit was still hitting the fan, which for me shows that the 007 status was indeed just a number.

I found some of the action to be lacking, but that staircase scene made up for the shortcomings.

Killing James when he was THIS close to a happy ending with a wife and daughter was obscenely cruel and broke the arc set in the first movie of him just trying to enjoy his life for once.  The way in which he died, knowing if he survived he couldn't have the things in his life worth living for, was just so sad.",q3nxx2

hft8hoh,"Not a huge fan. It seems as though this movie wanted to make sure that any that come after it can't continue the franchise without completely rewriting the Bond mythos, like it wanted to drop the mic and throw a lit match behind it as it walked out the door while the whole building burns down. *Spectre*, for all its flaws, at least left its ending open enough for another actor to step into the role of James Bond in the usual fashion (since it was supposed to be Daniel Craig's final turn in the role), but *No Time To Die* seems to want to start completely fresh and away from what the franchise has done - and its fans have enjoyed - since 1962.

hgtaa5s,"I felt like they tried to split the difference between a classic bond movie (somewhat campy, 2-D villains, escapist fantasy) and a serious drama, and ended up with a terrible result that doesn’t do a good job of either.

The main villain’s motivations never made sense (fine for a Bond movie, not a serious drama) SPECTRE and Blofeld were throwaways and far too easily dispatched (awful for both), and the ending came off as blah (Terrible for a Bond movie for obvious reasons, but unearned and strange as a serious drama given how cartoonish and one-dimensional the villain was).

Also the nanobots are such a cheap plot device. EMPs destroy nanobots. Other nanobots could destroy nanobots. There are countless ways Bond could have been antidoted. And how the fuck would they stay powered for “eternity” or even just a person’s lifetime?

You had three new bad guys that got no background at all and put up zero effort in their fights with bond. On top of that the main bad guy had no real cause for wanting to poison the world besides ""I want to tidy up"". Give the guy five more minutes to give me something. 

A good bad guy makes you feel for him and be torn. I didn't feel anything for any of the bad guys.

One of the things that I liked about earlier Craig Bond movies was they had embraced better combat choreography and didn't have the goofy point and click shooting. Or henchmen running at you with guns. This one went backwards and just made the agents invincible superheroes again. 

It had so much potential and such a great environment to be shot in, not the worst bond movie but definitely not in my top ten.",q3nxx2
hfycbl2,"On a whole probably my favorite Craig Bond film.

That said, still has some serious issues. For one the villain was played perfectly by Rami Malek, but his story was so underdeveloped. At first he wanted revenge for the deaths of his family which makes sense but then he got it, and then he decided to just be some generic genocidal evil guy for no real reason at all. Also no real explanation of how he recruited so many people to loyally serve him at such an extreme level.  And as others have noted his age doesn't really fit in the timeline well unless he was actually quite a bit older than Rami Malek. Also Ana de Armas, heavily advertised, really badass character and the hottest Bond girl of all of the Craig films...and yet she's barely in the movie! And finally Blofeld getting canned like that felt pretty anti-climatic.

But still a must see, and I thought the ending was very fitting, especially if you accept the ""James Bond is a codename"" theory explaining all the multiple agents.",q3nxx2

HMS Dragon could have detonated their missiles, waited for Bond to escape and then fired again. No immediate need now now now now....

Ana de Armas was *utterly* smoking. 

 Safin as a villain... just mumbling with 'argh vengeance' as his motive felt kinda off.

While I still think that they should stick to single Bond films every 4/5 years, they did a great job of convincing me that it wouldn't be the *worst* idea to tell extra stories in this world with some of the other characters they've established here.

I really enjoyed how Nomi was introduced and thought Lashana Lynch nailed every single line and move she had, but I honestly don't see anyone having the balls to pull the trigger and actually make her the star of a full-on Bond film any time soon. I can, however, absolute see a spin-off movie/series/whatever getting greenlit, and if that's what it takes to get more of her character then I'm all for it.

\- Terrible villain. Just a nothing, generic bad guy with no backstory and no motivations. Complete utter nonsense, worthy of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers at best.

\- Unnecessarily incomprehensible and uninteresting plot. Sounds like it was written by a bad AI.

\- Dreadfully dull dialogue. The parts where it's just dullards like M explaining shit to Bond were so wooden, lifeless and boring that I almost fell asleep. They were very reminiscent of the stilted dialgoue in the non-action scenes of the Phantom Menace.

\- Awful chemistry between Bond and Madeline. Genuinely not sure I can remember and on-screen couple with less chemistry. Just made me not give a fuck about anything to do with that couple. Lea Seydoux was particularly to blame for this, she was terrible, with the same expression on her face regardless of whether she was chilling at home, or in a car chase.

\- Awful chemistry between Bond and his child. Not even a tiny semblance of a father/daughter spark there.

\- New 007. Another incredibly boring character, who's part in the film went absolutely no where, and could have easily been cut out completly. See also that American guy, in fact, the entire CIA part was absolutely pointless.

\- Long gone are the days of interesting gadgets. Instead we just have Q and an all powerful laptop that can literally do anything the plot requires. So boring.

hfxdduf,"I’ve never been so angry at the end of a movie as I was at the end of No Time To Die.  Killing of an icon like James Bond isn’t clever writing and is nothing but a cheap lazy vision to recreate a cinematic universe for the sake of shock and for ultimately shaking up a franchise so they can maybe appease the new woke world that’s pining for a female Bond, a Black, Asian or Indian Bond or even a gay Bond. 

This movie had so much potential that was failed by the miscasting of the villain who’s biggest distraction wasn’t his Freddie Krueger makeup, but his obvious age gap between himself and Ms Swann. His storyline and power was weak while the conclusion of Blofeld’s story was lackluster and underwhelming.  

The replacement 007 was forgettable and her mere presence seemed forced and unnecessary.  Felix and his new CIA agents were the highlight of the film who all deserved more screen time and story.  

A poison garden villain lair turns out to be the dumbest and most unsatisfying final act locations.  

On the plus side, Swann and Baby Bond are a great storyline and even when Freddie Krueger had a terribly lame final fight with Bond, but scratches Bond with tiny baby bots, it was a nice twist that would’ve been more cruel to Bond if he lived than if they killed him off. 

Anyway, shame on Barbara Broccoli for ending the legacy of James Bond this way.  She killed off our hero of the last almost 60 years.  When the world needs saving most for all of us movie watchers, lazy producers write off cinema’s greatest character.",q3nxx2
hft50l9,"The fact that the reviews are this positive has to be a testament for how much people missed going to the movies, not how good this movie was. It aspires to soar to the highs of Spyfall, but it has a much more ""mini-series"" feel to it than a live-action movie should.

CONS:

1) Horrible villain - the villain is flat and dumb, does inexplicable things, lacks the backstory to make him truly interesting and essentially serves as a plot device rather than a truly fleshed out human. 0/10. The secondary villain is lifted straight out of ""Goldeneye"" together with all of the racist stereotypes about ""Russian bad scientist."" -5/10 for that secondary villain. Blofeld is absolutely wasted in this movie, and you cannot patch the plotholes surrounding him with all the asphalt in the world.

2) There is way too little action for 163 minutes of runtime. By the time credits roll, you will have completely forgotten about the Cuba scene, which is the absolute high-point of the movie.

3) Plot holes are aplenty, and the McGruber with the ""end of world threat"" is something lifted straight out of the ""worst"" (in many people's opinions) Mission Impossible movie.

4) I really hope they don't try this ""overarching storyline across 5 movies"" stuff ever again. James Bond, imo, works best as ""villain of the decade"" type stuff, rather than ""Spectre is evil and they will be evil for 5 movies"" type deal. Franchise building only works well when the story is fleshed out well over those N movies e.g. Jason Borne trilogy. 16 years is a bit too long to span this ""Spectre"" storyline.

Pros

1) It was a cool IMAX experience.

2) The final action scene aka the tower ascending was probably the best depiction of what a force of nature Bond really is. I wish it didn't end on a joke tho.

3) The love story works a bit more than it doesn't so overall it is a pro. JB not wanting to copulate with Ana de Armas' character was a welcome change of pace of him sleeping with literally all female characters.

4) The entire Cuba sequence was absolutely delightful, and I wish the entire movie was done like that.

Don't go watching it alone, go watch it with a friend, and preferably in IMAX. If you don't have IMAX or a friend, wait for the VoD.",q3nxx2
hnh8bj8,"A lot of issues with this movie have already been mentioned, but one thing that stood out to me that was annoying was how this film slapped on a thin layer of diversity to show that the MI6 organization is an inclusive workspace. Don't get me wrong - I believe more people of color should be in films like this, but the roles themselves were problematic to me. I'd argue that this story could have easily written out the roles of Nomi and Moneypenny. Nomi just tagged along on a lot of the same missions as Bond which wasn't necessary. Moneypenny led Bond to Q which is something that Bond could have probably figured out how to do on his own.  
Alternatively, in my favorite recent Bond film, Skyfall, Moneypenny taking the shot was the inciting incident of the film.

Going one step deeper, the reason diversity is important in any organization is because it brings in more perspectives and way of thinking from different backgrounds to solve a problem. I feel like everyone in MI6 just thought the exact same way and did what they were told.",q3nxx2
hfvhcyn,"""NO TIME TO DIE"" first thoughts:

My overall score: 5.5/10

In comparison, I gave Casino Royale a 9.5/10. 

No Time to Die felt rushed and incomplete. Or rather, perhaps too complete. Like they crammed 3-4 movies into one. 

First off, they wasted a great ending villain in Christoph Walz. Just an outstanding actor, and much more coherent and creepy than Rami Malek. I felt like Rami was the lamest villain of all the Daniel Craig-era bad guys. Just felt like a Great Value Creepy Villain cookie cutter mold. Which, by the way I would rank the Craig-era villains:

Blofeld, Raul Silva, Le Chiffre, Dominic Greene, Rami Malek.

Alright, let's get into it:

Didn't care about Lashana Lynch. Character came across as rushed, incomplete, and cocky. If you're going to make a character rushed and incomplete, for the love of Britain do not make them cocky. Just comes across as filler, and annoying at that. What's her backstory? Would love to know more. Possibility for spin-off film featuring just her, but honestly we just don't know enough.

Leya Seydoux has the personality of stale bread. At least you can eat bread, so it serves some purpose. Leya throughout the movie was drab, depressed, worried, or crying. We don't get to see any of her positive attributes that would make a man like James Bond fall in love with her (think of Bond and Vesper's meeting in the train car, or their ride to the hotel where she makes a Catholic jokes about sleeping separately). Eva Green played that part well, because you could see her as an intellectual and humorous match to James. With Leya? No such feeling.

Felix Leiter? What the fuck was that? Just an absolutely comically useless CIA agent. Gets shot. Sits around. Drowns. Fukunaga couldn't find a better ending for a great side character? 

Random white dude state department guy was SUPER lame. Felt like a Mission Impossible character add-on, but worse. Guarantee you the actor is the Producer's kid or something. 

No discussion of bad characters would be complete without the stupid Russian scientist. Just an absolute blabbering idiot. ""We need to gehht ze files!!"" WHAT?! Why even have him in the movie? They had a chance to combine him with the State department character to at least bring some cohesion? Just totally dumb and useless. Imagine how out of place he would be in a film like Casino Royale. Picture Jar Jar Binks walking into the poker room in a tuxedo. 

Random humorous thoughts:

What was the significance of the mask??? No one explained it. Like we're supposed to be scared of some fuck in a white geisha mask? L. O. L. 

Why did they do my boy Mallory like that?! Mallory came across as rushed, angry, and incoherent. He's so angry at Bond, but then two scenes later they're totally fine and working together?! Ralph Fiennes is an outstanding actor, so thankfully he salvaged what he could of M's reputation by the end. 

Ana De Armas was utterly useless. Her character served no purpose at all except to be a hot Bond girl who can do Yoda flips. You can tell some old Harvey Weinstein type fuck was in his office like, ""Hey can we get that Mexican girl from Knives Out? Yeah, just stick her in Cuba or something.""

Shoutout to Moneypenny and Q - minor characters who deserved more screentime and who were believable and intelligent as Bond's colleagues. 

Best acting performances go to Christoph Walz and Ralph Fiennes. Both of whom deserved more screentime. Daniel Craig was great as well, but they oscillated between ""funny ex-agent"" and uncompromising ""do-all-it-takes"" man on a mission. Idk his character felt incomplete. 

Also, I understand that not all movies can end happily...but they had the opportunity to save Bond by having him escape the island in the underwater glider. That would actually be the most believable part of the whole island sequence. He could've showed up on the rocks and said something like, ""Today is no time to die"" as the credits roll. But no. They just have him get fucking smoked by his own country's missiles. LOL. What a shitshow. 

Anyways, let me know your thoughts. Perhaps a second watch will be kinder.",q3nxx2
hg6pfn3,"Just got back and I'm still shaken. I went in with very low expectations. Like *real* low. You know this movie was impactful when everyone was dead silent when the credits rolled.

What a stellar fucking opening act. This, this is how you build suspense.

I didn't think it was possible, but this was right up there with Casino Royale. What a beautiful swansong for Daniel's Bond. Daniel got to be the Bond of his movie instead of what happened to Wesley Snipes in Blade Trinity.

Was it perfect? No. I didn't like how they messed with his propensity to monologue which was close to nil to begin with. There were a couple of scenes where it was just plain jarring.

But, every complaint I had with Spectre was erased here. I can respect Madeleine now after Vesper. Léa Seydoux was allowed to show us why she belongs with Bond.

Moneypenny 2 aka ""007"" was (thankfully) kept in check so I could enjoy *my* Bond.

And, Rami Malek pulled off what the dude with the axe couldn't do in QoS. Rami was actually menacing.

I really thought Skyfall was it. But, Cary Fukunaga, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade know what they're doing because I counted four times where I almost cried. What a ride.",q3nxx2
hlux2te,"What a fucking nothingburger of a movie...so listless and dull aside from some cool visuals in Jamacia and the chemical plant. Plus a terrible song and weak villain, the bumbling scientist had more development and better lines! 

I expected Bond to die, but...fighting a bad guy and leading a team of Navy/Special Ops like The Spy Who Loved Me.",q3nxx2
hgaalx6,"Yeah movie was ok, definitely took redundant things from the past Bond movies. Great action scenes but nothing new that we haven't seen before. 

Couple of thoughts:

* Bond's 'love' for Madelyn felt the same as his 'love' for Vesper which is weird when they haven't seen each other for 5 years. Both tied to criminal orgs.

* Also shoehorning in his daughter as a plot device seemed super lazy. 

* Very dissapointed with Safin and barely could understand what he was saying. His motivations felt like every other ecoterrorist in films, he had no beef with Bond but with Madelyn because her father killed his family...

* Why didn't Mr. White go after Safin after he killed his wife? 

* Also did Safin not age from the day he first met Madelyn to when he comes back? 

* So is Primo working for Spectre or Safin? Was it explained how he ended up working for Safin?

* Blofeld wanted to kill Bond in Cuba knowing that somehow he'll be there and used Obruchev as bait. Like homie you could've shot this dude in plain sight if you wanted it so badly. Mans wanted to create a Nanobot-19 to kill this dude in style. Bruh I'm pretty sure you could pay some random bloke in the UK to throw some acid and do the same shit. 

* Specter was a jobber, so was Blofeld. What a waste of a tremendous actor in Waltz.

* Logan Ash = Craig Mitchell

* Seems like the main villain of this movie is Mallory because his incompetency of not protecting a biochemical weapon.

* If Mallory decided to notify Japan, Russia of a biochemical weapon in the Island couldn't Bond have gone with Mallory to the island. Wait for nations to come to together go into the island open the blast doors and then nuke it?

* Safin's plan with Bond is hoping the Bond would come back to his little safe space and infect him? He had multiple opportunities of doing this without dying. 

* Ending sequence with the stairs and the control room was awful. Bond was shooting down dudes with advantages and angles. Like thick plot armor. No creativity at all and no sense of danger. 

* Unpopular opinion but Craig isn't great on acting when he's vulrenable he does it 3 times this film (Madelyn and Bond's reconliation in Norway, Bond asking to apologize toSafin and his goodbye to Madelyn) 
 and it felt like miss on all three. Felt really forced. 

I'd rank them as follows:

Skyfall  
Casino Royale  
No Time to Die  
Spectre   
Quantum of Solace",q3nxx2
hft9s13,"Who was Rami Malek?? Like, I didn't understand his character at all. Where did he get the money to have an ISLAND! 

And who were Léa's parents? Mainly her father. Just, an assassin?? That's it? 

I don't know. The set pieces were amazing but the development of the characters was just really weak to me.",q3nxx2
hfu6pa6,"Am I crazy or did Lea Seydoux tell Bond that the kid wasn’t his when we first meet her? Wouldn’t the first question be “Then whose is it?” Because she looks 5 and Bond left Madeleine 5 years ago. Where is the father then? Are we to believe that Madeleine found a man shortly after bond, had a child and that father also died or left? 

I guess you could say Bond knew it was his and kept up with the lie. Still odd that there’s no trying of an explanation when there would be so many questions.",q3nxx2
hfwl7xl,"It just...wasnt that good, although it did manage to keep me engaged throughout. At many points it just didnt feel like a Craig Bond movie. Weak villain; didnt fully understand his motive. Also, was he like immortal?",q3nxx2

While it certainly felt long, it was very much Avengers Endgame long; a long movie with plenty going on to keep you engaged. There were some bloated scenes that could've been trimmed out. And by itself, it had the elements of a generic 007 film. But thanks to slick action, gorgeous cinematography, Craig absolutely OWNING the Bond role, exciting new characters, and those very bold plot moves, I walked away feeling very satisfied. It was the perfect end to Craig's Bond films and I hope the future of the franchise expands on some of the elements he helped introduced into not just Bond, but that universe. A solid 90/100 from me

hftjvun,"I was so hyped for this movie for years and left a theater with disappointment. I think the movie shares the same problem with the last one. NTTD tried so hard to wrap up every movie Craig did from Casino Royale to Spectre, but it turned out to be another copy of Spectre. Just adding new villain replacing Blofeld here.

The way they decided to wrap up the whole saga of Craig-Bond seems so lazy to me. They just chose the easiest way to end the story, killing everybody, instead of writing more convincing and good one. Blofeld dead, Felix dead, and even Bond is dead here. It almost felt like they wanted to erase every trace of Craig era, and As a fan of his era, I didn't like it at all.

I guess it was supposed to be emotional when Bond is dead, but It just didn't work for me. This hugely results from the relationship between Bond and Madeleine. Like the last movie, Madeleine and Bond had zero chemistry here as well. I still have no idea why they chose her to be Bond's 'the one'. Léa Seydoux is a good actress, no offense to her. She just doesn't have a sparkle with Craig, and yes, of course their age gap doesn't help.

Probably filmmakers already noticed that and tried to fix it here. They even spent the first 5 minute just for giving a backstory to Madeleine. But her arc is still shallow like the last one and I couldn't find any reason to care about her. So this problem made Bond's final more anti-climatic. I just couldn't relate to Bond sacrificing himself for this woman and daughter he just met. (And bringing back Vesper from the start was a very bad idea, too. Let audience compare Madeleine and Vesper? There is zero chance for Madeleine to win.)

Other than cinematography, the movie seemed so bland. It looks gorgeous like other Craig's Bond movies, but there is no memorable character, action sequence, or music. (I love Hans Zimmer, but his score here was very forgettable.) It's not a bad Bond movie, but I want Craig-Bond fans to lower your expectation before watching it. It is just a little bit better version of Spectre with a lot of deaths.

P.S.: If they had killing bond in their mind from the start, why the hell did they name it *No Time To Die*? They used all the time they had to kill Bond...",q3nxx2
hgt137g,"With masculinity as a theme so intrinsically interwoven in the Bond franchise, and especially with the Craig era examining Bond’s relationships to females, I think it was pretty clever that both the male leads end up being literally toxic to the woman they love",q3nxx2
hh1ybks,"I have so many thoughts leaving the theater.

* Serializing James Bond was a fatal mistake for the Daniel Craig Era.
* Hans Zimmer phoned it in on this one.
* I'm not sure if the villain was suppose to be Dr. No with all the vibes it was going for. Even the title sequence started with the Dr. No dots, villain with mixed ancestry, and the heavy world ending plot. I don't know if it was nixed or something.
* This entire movie feels like it was backwards engineering Bond's death. He needs to have a kid, so I guess we're stuck with the Bond girl where he has no chemistry with. They have to  transition from spectre to the new villain so he can have this elaborate death with the nano bot stuff that felt like I was watching Metal Gear solid at times. 
* I thought the first half was excellent Bond, but the second half was disappointing. 
* Loved Arma de armas and I was like ""COME BACK, bring back the fun and chemistry"". A nice Knives Out reunion too. Lashanna Lynch was a fun addition, but wasn't given enough lines to jab at Bond. Jeffry Wright as Felix is such a bro, I'm sad he didn't have more scenes in previous movies with Bond.

hg6zwe8,"I never thought there would be a Craig Bond film worse than Spectre, yet here we are. What started off as a welcome departure and undoing of Spectre’s shortcomings turned into a double down of underwhelming mediocrity. I was never on board with Bond and Madeleine’s relationship as it felt super forced and unearned. But to have it jettisoned early on was encouraging, as well as Spectre being completely eliminated. With my least favorite elements of the franchise gone, I kept waiting for Rami Malek’s villain to make his grand entrance…and the waiting continued well until the 2nd half of the film. Which is also when Madeleine reappeared and the uninteresting relationship stakes were introduced. Once Bond and Madeleine’s daughter was introduced, the movie completely lost me. I knew it was going to be just another “saving the family” formula. Most of these issues are just inherent products of Spectre’s terrible setup but I wish they hadn’t double downed.

Some good points for sure were Ana de Armas’ Paloma. Super fun character who should get her own movie. Great to see Felix back in action, albeit briefly. Great cold open with Rami Malek and young Madeleine. Elevator shaft jump with the magnets was a neat trick. Other than that, not much else was entirely memorable or compelling. Craig’s true Bond arc for me is Casino, Quantum, Skyfall.",q3nxx2
hft34re,"Very much a dissapiontment.

&#x200B;

I love Craig, he might be my favorite Bond and I'm sad he's going on out on this. 

&#x200B;

A resonable effort, I didn't hate it but I didn't much care for it either. (Outside of Die Another Day, I don't think any Bond movie is truly a bad movie).  


It starts well enough, with a great car chase and everything around it after setting up where we are after SPECTRE. I spent the whole sequence expecting Madeline to be On Her Majesty's Secret Service'd, or fridged if you prefer that term. Glad they didn't do that, as might have sunk me out almost immediatly instead of the 2nd act.   


I love Billie Eilish, but that song was meh.

Great first proper act. Loved several agencies, including his former one and his replacement to boot, moving on the same target. That would have been an awesome overall plot. Sometimes working together, sometimes against. Different methods to the same goal. Jeffrey Wright continues to kill it as Leiter, and Ana DeArmas was wonderful, very sad neither pass the first act. The whole sequence with Spectre and the reveal/boat was incredible.  Question- why did the CIA just give up after Lieter died? 


Then the main crux starts and the movie begins to drag and get very sloppy with the storyteling. It's like they needed to despose of the last few movies first and spent most of the running time doing that in order to clear for Rami Malek. So much was unnecessary and bouncing around. This is where the bloated 2h45 comes from, that and scenes just taking forever.

&#x200B;

He was such a nothing bad guy. I can't believe they did they ""We're not so different you and I"" cliche. Even the henchmen, mainly Cyclops, were nothing.

The attempt to bring a heart to it fell flat. Nice idea, but it felt melodramatic, forced, and empty. (at least there wasn't a ""Dou Dou arrives in the mail, he might be alive!"" sting). I don't think it helped the normally solid Lea Seydoux chose to the whole film with a single facial expression, somewhere between crying and anger. 

I did so much eyerolling at many of the platetudes and things going on.   


I'm a Bond fan. I wanted to like this but I just couldn't.

For the next reboot, I think we should abandon the overly complicated modern era and lean into the classic 60s style.  A lot of fun could be had that way",q3nxx2
hfta0fi,"Saw it last night in IMAX. Was absolutely thrilling.

I see a lot of negative comments about how ""it's not a Bond film"" because Bond dies at the end. Daniel Craig's portrayal is a very modern and grounded take on the character, and I think him dying was the perfect send off for this particular Bond. The stakes felt a little more real with Craig's Bond, and I liked that. All the people saying Craig ""isn't really Bond"" is just nonsense to me, it's just some unwillingness to let characters adapt and change and be portrayed in different ways. I love that they took risks (and his death was emotional for me, I think it really worked).

At the end of the day, if you want to watch ""classic Bond"", then go... Watch the old James Bond movies? Do you really expect modern filmmakers to just retread the same ground over and over again? That kind of thinking is what gets you the tired remakes that have ravaged Hollywood the past few years. Let filmmakers try something new, especially when it comes to long-standing franchises like Bond.

Anyways, with that rant over, I loved this movie. The action sequences were thrilling (that staircase fight, the forest fight, the intro chase), the callbacks were great, I love them getting a little campy with the gadgets at the end, it felt like it maintained the same Craig-era tone while also paying homage to Bond's long history in film.

Ana De Armas absolutely stole the few scenes she was in. I'm sad we don't get to see more of her. Her and Daniel Craig have so much chemistry together. More of them in movies together, please.

My only real gripe with the movie was it felt like we didn't get a chance to really know Rami Malek's villain and understand his motivations. I feel like his character didn't get the time he needed to really develop. But Rami Malek did a good job nonetheless and this is a minor gripe for me, because overall I loved the movie.

I loved the ending. Like I said, perfect send off for Craig's Bond, very fitting to his character. Out of Craig's Bond movies, I rank this one just slightly below Casino Royale (I'd rate that one a 10 and this one a 9, maybe 9.5). Had an amazing time with it.",q3nxx2
hgbqqos,This movie needed more Ana De Armas. They should have replaced the black chick with her and gotten rid of the entire new 007 plot-line. Then this movie would be perfect. She was the best out of all the other bond chicks in the movie.,q3nxx2
hgxl3co,"No disrespect to Lashana Lynch but Ana de Armas would’ve been a much better option for the “new 007”.  Lashana’s character was completely forgettable.

Even for a Bond movie this plot was completely ridiculous and the just like Spectre, it’s just too long. After Cuba pretty much I found myself checking my watch over and over again. Love Craig as Bond but for me of the 5 movies, the only ones I can say I truly enjoy are Casino Royale and Skyfall",q3nxx2
hpvcwmj,"Down there as one of the worst Bond movies. Daniel Craig, much like Pierce Brosnan, ended up being a good Bond in mostly bad movies. I hope his career will at least have better legs than Pierce's.
  
This movie runs almost 3 hours and does very little with it. The story is a mess and there is very little action, and the action they have, more so than most action movies, requires you to suspend your disbelief that the bad guys can't just hit Bond even when he's standing still.
  
The ending I feel is just unearned and feels like it tries to compensate for being a bad movie by making it emotional. It's  been done in multiple other movies and you can see it coming a good 10 minutes before it happens, and they really try to milk every last drop out of it. I just didn't care when I already knew that this would be Craig's final appearance.
  
I don't have a problem with diversity in the movies but... If you want to make an action movie with a black woman in the lead, just go ahead and make one. Who does it need to be a Bond cross-over, unless the studios themselves don't have confidence on it working on its own? Bond typically works alone and Lashana Lynch's character adds nothing to the movie.
  
Performances were good across the board, even if the characters weren't. A few good jokes. That's all the positive that I can say about this movie.
  
James Bond will return, but with Jeff Bezos in the picture (who would actually make a great Bond villain, but I doubt that they'll bite the hand that feeds them), I'm not sure if I'll even see another Goldeneye or a Casino Royale in my lifetime.",q3nxx2

Daniel craigs bond has had great scenes and whatnot but story wise they have irritated me. Like they just had to have every movie relate to the next one and carry over love and romance. I miss the older ones where every story was different. And it was more about bond actually doing spy things and bond moves and cool stealth scenes. Them having really cool gadgets and recently they have just been making it lamer and lamer.

Nevertheless, the writing of the movie could be better. At times it felt like two separate movies combined together. 

Rami Malek's Safin is incredibly underdeveloped. How did he amass such a huge army of followers? I'm guessing his family was rich too? I understood his revenge against Spectre considering what happened to his parents, but his motivation afterwards just felt spotty with wanting to unleash heracles and his beef with Bond. 

I like Nomi as she contrasted Bond being more by the books as a 00 agent. If they make a spinoff with 00 agents, I would hope to see something like this as opposed to having James Bond's personality plastered on someone else. However, I don't understand how she suddenly agreed on James Bond being given his 007 designation again. Felt like there should have been a scene that led to her respecting Bond or and a build up to that scene. 

Ana de Armas's Paloma was the best new character. Her character was fun and I like how you go in thinking she's just some rookie CIA agent, but then suddenly proves her worth (I wonder if Ana really did that hook kick in heels because that was impressive) and makes us think the same thing as James did ""Three weeks of training, huh?"" It's incredibly disappointing how she was practically a cameo appearance. I felt like she had more chemistry with Bond then Lea Seydox. 

I'm glad that Madeline's fleshed out, but for some reason I never believed the chemistry between her and Bond. Their relationship was quite sudden in Spectre after they kill Batitsa. It is improved here though I admit, and it makes sense that Bond has a kid given how much unprotected sex he has.

Felix was a great part of that movie, but his partner was a very strange part of that movie. I didn’t like how he was so significant and then they just ended him like that.

I felt like they should have ended the movie in the pool. Maybe he should have killed him, opened the doors, and then came back. Didn’t like the delivery of his end. Was too abrupt for me.

I know Bond films are very romantic and cheesy at times, but I thought that was too cheesy and romantic for a Daniel Craig Bond ending.

Anyone have any thoughts for me? Maybe my expectations were too high.",q3nxx2
hg2s0jk,"Definitely a contender for my favourite Bond film between this and Casino Royale, my only issues are that with how poorly Spectre handled the concept of a shadow organisation it hinders this one a bit especially with Blofeld who felt kind of intentionally comical in this one? 


I also find Madeline and Bonds chemistry not to be as strong as Vespas which also hinders the emotional impact of this film but I still felt they did as good a job as they could after Spectre.


I loved the many callbacks to the classic Bond films and I enjoyed all the supporting cast as much as the stella performance Craig gave. I also really liked the new 007, the film didn't try to shove it in our faces that she was a woman which most films love to make a point of because they want to look progressive which ironically does the opposite because making a big deal makes it seem like it should be seen as one when in an ideal would it shouldn't. 


Seeing my boy Felix die was painful and I loved Jeffrey Wright in the role, he comes off as the kind of guy you'd wanna share a pint with. It was certainly nice to see Ana De Armas in this film though she felt kind of shoe horned in, maybe Craig wanted to work with her again after Knives Out which they both were fantastic in. She plays the ""I'm out of my depth"" character really well in her movies and she kicked ass in this one.


The villain Safin was pretty good in this film too, Rami Malek did a great job portraying him as this unhinged calm mad man who thinks he's ridding the world of all evil.


I loved the end to Craig's Bond and it's such a horrible fate for him which I oddly liked, it fit the Craig era of Bond which was always more bleak than previous eras. No fairytale ending which in the spy world is only a dream. Many might hate how Bond just gives up trying to live but I think many would do the same if they could never touch their loved ones again. Such a thing would be worse than death to many.  I was worried they were gonna leave it inconspicuous if he died, maybe show him land in the water face down but nope, literal missle to the face. It would have certainly destroyed the emotional impact if he survived somehow.",q3nxx2
hg7wlp0,This movie had a big Kojima influence IMO,q3nxx2
hg8ckcd,"I really only have one big gripe. The movie begins with the gun barrel sequence, but there's no blood nor does give us an origin point for a wipe transition into the scene. It just sort of...fades into the scene from the barrel sequence. I know this seems like an odd point to get caught up on, but hear me out. Looking back I expected the classic ""shoot, bleed, fall to the corner, wipe in to a landscape shot from the barrel, show us what Bond is up to"" and having it impotently just fade into an overhead shot of a flashback just feels very off.

What's even more interesting to me is how much they focused on callbacks to Bond tropes and previous entries--stuff like the Dr. No opening stylization and the villain cameos in the background at the SPECTRE party--but they specifically avoided a bloody gunbarrel and a corner wipe. It's just...very odd to me, and I think that it's such a huge part of the Bond trope, and sits in so much contrast to the rest of the callbacks in the film, that it sort of throws the whole thing off balance from the jump and you don't realize that's what throws it off balance until you look back at it. 

I agree the pacing could have been better--while Quantum of Solace was a breathless, overwhelming action flick, this one felt like some exposition scenes were TOO long--but Bond films have always taken their time and this shouldn't be a huge issue by itself. But it's not by itself; we're repeatedly exposed to nostalgia (much of that thanks to lingering shots and extraneous dialogue that did contribute significantly to the laggy pacing), which sits in stark contrast to the first nostalgia piece we get in the movie: a gunbarrel sequence that felt off. 

It doesn't make it a bad movie by any means. I enjoyed how they wrapped everything up, and I've honestly enjoyed the multi-film threads they've woven; it feels more like Fleming's writing style than the series ever has. But if watching a movie is like driving a car, this one was perfectly functional but it had a wheel off-balance; the wheel weights are the nostalgia pieces, and the missing weight was the odd gunbarrel. It feels odd at the time and you quickly forget about it, but later in the movie as you run into Goldfinger in the background of the party, the OHMSS music, the references to the Rogue Agent game, and the rest, you realize something is off and you can't figure out what; in your subconscious, that odd gunbarrel weighs against those, and it gets distracting without you knowing why. 

That distraction leads you to start looking for things so you understand what feels off, and you start realizing things like: the pacing sucks; Ana de Armas should have had more screen time because how dare they give us a character so great and just toss her away; Bond never smoked that cigar, after the film made a point of him holding on to it; the sound balance makes Rami downright impossible to understand at times; what was the point of new 007's cool new hypercar if we never get to see what it can do? It starts to feel like several movies slapped together in post, which is fine if you realize it the second time you watch it but should never be so apparent during your first viewing of the final piece in the series, when you want to be invested in how this will end. 

Looking back at the imagery and symbolism they wove in, telling us this isn't just the last Craig film but that it signals a hard reset for the series as a whole, I feel like I should have been more emotional about the ending. I wanted to shed a tear about the finality of it, I think we all did. But we were robbed of that by all the distracting elements, and they all drill down to a single origin point: the gunbarrel felt off, and it threw everything else out of balance. 

In a film that's built on opposing symmetry to the OHMSS film and the YOLT novel, balance is critical. And by failing the first scene in the film, they destroy the foundation on which they tried to build that symmetry.",q3nxx2

hft8ghe,"I liked it a lot! Bonds final assault to get to the silo blast doors was excellent. Really liked the one take as he’s in the cramped staircase fighting his way to the top. The other standout action sequences were the escape from Madeleines home and fight in the woods, as well as the entire Cuba sequence. Ana De Armas was so good in this!

Minor complaint is that the movies end feels kind of abrupt? Bond dies and then the movie ends like 3 minutes later. We get MI6 sharing a drink in his honor, Madeleine drives into a tunnel and then the end. I don’t know exactly what else could’ve been there but I feel like it was missing something. Other than that, great film. A fitting and great end to Craig’s Bond",q3nxx2
hfy0elu,"An enjoyable film, the only thought I have about this film is that it felt very un-Bond-like and more like a mission impossible film. The few things that stood out to me

1. Felix Leiter's death. His death didn't seem to have a purpose other than for Bond to mention ""I had a brother too"" to Logan Ash before killing him. which brings me to...
2. Logan Ash's betrayal. I think double agent should have a good reason to betray the protagonist, whereas Logan's betrayal felt like it was there only to drive the plot. 
3. Blofeld. SPECTRE's mastermind, Bond's nemesis. It felt a little cheap to have him die so suddenly. Perhaps it was to make Safin appear more powerful, but I hope SPECTRE returns at some point (despite the death of its members and Blofeld)
4. Safin. I think he is a well designed Bond villain. He began with a personal vendetta against Madeleine's family and SPECTRE , but somewhere along the way decided to eradicate half the world. I wished there was more backstory to his motives, but maybe it's even scarier to have a villain who wants kill half the world with no motive at all. Safin has potential, and he did kill Blofeld, so I kinda wanted to see him become the next ""Blofeld"". 
5. Bond's death. It's kind of a running gag to see Bond escape death in the most ridiculous manner, so it's pretty touching to see him die on his own accord to protect his family. 

A film with some flaws, but overall a touching end to the Craig era.",q3nxx2
hg0w87k,"Saw this with my dad and my grandpa, they were furious about the ending, I was disappointed by the ending as well. I thought the action and all was well done but that downer of an ending really dragged it down for me. Bond as a character should be able to defy all odds and get the girl while riding off into the sunset, it’s imo a fundamental part of the character. It came across to me as them wanting to do something that was edgy in the franchise. plus the plot was just way too convoluted. I hope going forward they scale it back a bit and do sorta standalone stories like they did until Craig’s era. Overall it’s a decent movie but it’s a mid tier Bond for me",q3nxx2
hg1i6nc,"Messy, messy movie. There were some really beautiful sequences and creative directing/cinematography, but they didn't compensate for the lack of imagination elsewhere.

The plot was all over the place - there were countless plot holes, and the plot armor was more prominent than it usually is in these sorts of movies. Spectre's demise was a bit difficult to swallow. It was meant to make Safin seem more formidable, but he ended up being a lackluster villain (low screentime and weak motivations).

The action had great moments, but felt uninspired in general - toward the end, the constant slog of cannon fodder soldiers was a bit exhausting since there was no real fear that Bond would die. The Scandinavian car chase scene where a few of Safin's cars just flipped on small hills and obstacles without trying to ram him or shoot him (no bulletproof glass this time) was the icing on the cake. Zimmer's score was good, but the action music especially was incredibly generic - I think Newman (and Arnold before him) did a much better job at conveying Bond.

All in all, a pretty lackluster attempt IMO. Definitely stronger than Quantum, but I find it hard to say it's definitely above Spectre, which is a disappointment.",q3nxx2
hg2b0kt,"There were just too many issues with this movie that led to me finding it hard to enjoy.

How did Blofeld and Safin learn about Heracles or the scientist guy? 

How did they get all the DNA they needed for the James Bond / Spectre murder thing? 

Why did Safin want to kill the Spectre members? 

Why did he want to kill a bunch of random people all around the world? I didn't understand Safin's motivations at all.

Why did Safin return to intercept/shoot Bond when he was last seen trying to leave the island? 

Why did Bond's watch not damage his own earpiece? 

How was Blofeld able to communicate with his bionic eye when he's in an underground compound that ostensibly blocks signals?

Why didn't Bond try to survive and at least buy himself some time for someone to figure out a way to counter the nanobots in his bloodstream? 

What was this deal with the missile silo stuff and the ""super fast"" incoming planes or whatever?

Why was Bond just _standing there_ during so many scenes where people are literally firing automatic weapons at him? 

It didn't help that the dialogue was often hard to hear, either because the volume wasn't quite right or because characters were whispering, or when important plot details were given in dialogue from characters whose accents I couldn't fully understand.

There were too many generic car chase scenes. I wanted more hand-to-hand combat and general ass-kicking. We got a little bit of it with the stairwell scene but there just wasn't enough of it. 

All in all, I left the theater feeling underwhelmed. Though I did enjoy the scene with Q and the USB - a bit of an in-joke to fans for everyone giving him crap for sticking a USB into the MI6 mainframe in Skyfall. This time around Q takes the time to ask ""Where has this USB been? Better stick it in the sandbox!"" lol",q3nxx2

hg5ms1b,"I love James Bond. I grew up with Daniel Craig and watched all the other classic movies when I got older. But idk, I'm kinda dissapointed with this one 

You have a Bond which is a far cry from the previous movies. I liked how his attitude was different, more playful while still retaining that bondness we all know.

But the plot itself i thought was meh. You have Spectre, the big bad organisation that was in the shadows for 3 movies long, killed in the first what, half hour? Then, out of nowhere comes Safir. All this time he had a big bad group of soldiers and a big island and no one knew. I thought it was just cheap, trying to recreate a big villain like they had in Spectre, only it didn't work because he came out of nowhere without any build up. 

Then the Vesper thing, I thought it would be interesting to explore how much Bond still is dealing with it after QoS, but it's just 5 minutes and boom. Not mentioned again.

Same with his family/ Madeline. The short time we spend with her in Spectre and the short time we spend with her in NTTD just doesn't feel enough to really feel any connection to her character. And definitely no connection to the daughter, who just came out of nowhere. (Just how I think of it)

And Bond's death was ok too. I mean he died a badass death, but it just felt so unnatural for me. Like they just made the movie just for the sake of making it. I don't really feel it added anything to Bond's story. Things could have ended at Spectre and for me that would have been a better ending. So I give it a 6.5/10 due to the cool action sequences it had.

Felt stylistically like a 60s/70s Bond movie in a cool way. The opening sequence and the Billie Eilish song worked.

Also, a Bond movie had the balls to kill off three longtime series stalwarts in one movie: Felix Leiter, Blofeld, and Bond himself. And drop an F-bomb.

Compared to Skyfall and Spectre, I really didn't feel invested in the action, intrigue or characters, even if many of them were recurring characters I should have cared about.

So now it's hard to really look forward to a sequel ... Since they killed all their good villains, their protagonist and it seems what we're getting in an obilgatory Female Ghostbuster / Batwoman type of failure next...

why was the whole movie about Madeline? Why was the new 007 so Hyped yet did so little in the film? Why did Rami Malek have such little screentime?",q3nxx2
hfz01js,"Terrible writing, Daniel Craig deserved better as did this film.",q3nxx2
hg0lmwn,"Great movie but one thing I hated was when the evil scientist told Nomi he could wipe out her entire race before she killed him. I think I even audibly said ""stupid"" right there in the theater quietly when it happened.

Can I ever watch something involving black people without being reminded of their race? The race of an actor doesn't need to be some elephant in the room that always has to be addressed.",q3nxx2
hg8xou3,"Everyone is stanning De armas but the whole thing was just kind of corny. In Casino Royale, Solace, and skyfall they would have never had a sequence like that with a random, ultimately irrelevant to the plot female character just for theatrics and a pretty face. This movie was so bloated and just didnt feel like a Craig Bond movie.",q3nxx2
hi7oemp,"One of the worst bond movies I’ve seen, and the worst of Craig’s. Utterly forgettable in every facet except his death.",q3nxx2
hk11kp0,Let's just pretend this movie was never made.,q3nxx2
hg2qna4,"It would have been nice if Nomi/007 could have gotten through the whole film without her skin colour being brought up 

The writers obviously thought drawing attention to it and ethnicity as a target was somehow helping",q3nxx2
hft7wdj,"Having the knowledge that this was Craig's last Bond really took away a bit of the suspense. I figured Felix was going to die as soon as things went sour, and I knew Bond would stay behind as soon as they mentioned blowing up the whole island. Wanting to send this Bond arc out with a bang and finish off some the characters felt very telegraphed, and thus I didn't have the feeling of ""oh shit how's James going to get out of this one!?"". Makes me sad too cause this James deserves to go live with his wife and kid.",q3nxx2
hftadl9,Incredible movie. That was like an event. Feel bad for whoever has to follow in Craigs footsteps,q3nxx2
hftbwe2,"Definitely see it in IMAX if you can. The movie is gorgeous and sounds AMAZING. I am going to miss Craig so much. What an amazing run of films as Bond. 

I love the emotional ending and it had me choked up. Cannot wait to see it again!",q3nxx2
hfts7k7,"Loved the movie, I even got it ahead of Skyfall. That ending hit me like a ton of bricks, had me bawling in the theater. I grew up with Craig and Casino Royale is my favorite film of all time, so it was hard to see him go.",q3nxx2
hftwz5u,"Personally, really loved it, not as great as Skyfall but then not many movies are.


Either way, one thing really bothered me about it, maybe someone can explain - after the whole situation in Cuba, didn't the explicitly say that the nanbots are coded to kill everyone related to Blofeld? And they must have known he was ""infected"" at that point, right? So how come it didn't occur to literally no one that you know....maybe letting Bond see Blofeld is a bad idea? And if that's true, why even bother giving the therapist a modified version of the nanbots if obviously Bond already has them?

Like, I feel like either I'm missing something, or this really is as dumb as it sounds and the movie just rolls with it.",q3nxx2
hfu2827,"This franchise has been truly all over the place in quality, but I thought they stuck the landing in a finale that ties together the Craig era of Bond movies well and gives an emotionally satisfying conclusion to his character. My only gripe is that this film is probably too long, it's not as bloated as Spectre but you could shave off 20 minutes for sure. Craig and Seydoux kill it as you'd expect, but as for the newbies, Rami Malek gave an effectively creepy villain performance despite limited screentime and a motivation I didn't really understand, Lashana Lynch was a good addition to MI6 team that I hope sticks around. There's more of a focus on actual drama than the other Bond movies, but I think this time, it works.",q3nxx2
hfu40v2,Hans Zimmer just has this crazy ability to get into your soul. He can do no wrong!,q3nxx2
hfxhr3m,"Craig, Ana de armas and Lea Seydoux were all very good. However, even for what it is, this movie was very cliché especially the villain (facial disfigurement, generic foreign villain accent, island fortress, existential weapon), a bit nonsensical, and wore out its welcome by 15-20 min

It was a still good showcase for Daniel Craig's achievement as a defining version of James Bond. Ana de Armas was pretty stunning in a cameo-like role",q3nxx2
hfxhsec,"I liked it, but this movie really assumed I would remember Spectre more than I did, which is a bold choice considering Spectre is easily the most forgettable of the Craig films.

This film wants me to remember everything about how Bond, Bloefeld, SPECTRE, Quantum, Mr. White, and Madeleine are all connected.

Like, wasnt Mr. White Quantum, not SPECTRE? I forgot which omnipotent shadow organization does what.",q3nxx2
hg172hd,"They tied off all threads. Felix, Blofeld, Spectre, Bond, his family. M screwed up so badly with Heracles that he should be let go. Further, he made comments saying in essence that he doesn't know how to fight evil in the new world. Lastly, I don't think the ""code word bond"" theory holds well, so if they want to use the character again, they'll need a reboot.

My guess is that the franchise gets a complete reboot in 4-6 years when some of the Craig nostalgia wears off, and they get good writers together to figure out a new era with a new Bond in a new universe.

It's possible they bring back Q and Moneypenny, but staying in the same universe will narrow the narrative freedom a lot going forward.",q3nxx2
hkx3h62,"Maybe I missed something, but why didn't Madeline die when she came into contact with Bond. Wasn't he infected with the Heracles from the Spectre party? Her dad was former Spectre so shouldn't this have killed her, it killed one eye guy?

Might be a dumb question, but figured I would ask incase I missed something.",q3nxx2
hkokvo3,"Man did that ending leave me sour. There’s one rule for Bond and they broke it in an attempt to get a cheap response from the audience.

Bond always gets out and survives. You can’t change that.",q3nxx2
hfzo4pd,"Damn, talk about going out on top. I'm really happy MGM stuck to their guns and kept this in theaters instead of dumping it on a streaming service. This was the first movie I've been to where it was a totally packed house (Chicago) since *Avengers: Endgame*, and it was a super diverse, four-quadrant crowd. Lots of old people in the audience. It was electric to hear the cheering and clapping when the movie started, and the standing ovation when it ended. I've really missed going to the movies.

The movie itself was excellent-- I think Casino Royale is still a tighter, sleeker film overall, but No Time to Die knocked Skyfall off the number-two post. I heard a lot of complaints going in that Rami Malek wasn't in the movie very much but I thought Safin appeared just the right amount-- his presence is always *there*, just looming over the movie, because of how iconic that opening scene was. He felt like a slasher movie villain, and the damaged Koh mask is just icing on the creep cake. His motivations get pretty muddled by the end (okay, so he stole M's nanobots from a secret lab but let Spectre think they were stealing it, had his man on the inside (Obruchev) reprogram them to kill Spectre, and then... what? He talks about order and control and oblivion and people just wanting to be told what to do, but it's never quite clear what's at stake, except for the simulation Q finds showing what would happen if the virus were ever to be released, which in fairness to Safin doesn't sound like that was going to be his plan. Overall he's a 7/10 for me-- sufficiently creepy and capable, iconic look, but the plan wasn't explained well.

I LOVED Ana de Armas. She literally ran away with the entire movie for me. I think our theater collectively stopped breathing whenever she was on screen. I'm gay so she doesn't do anything for me *like that*, but holy shit she looked like a queen. Her whole klutzy-adorable, ""I'm-brand-new-at-this-but-also-I'm-really-good-at-it"" act was such a refreshing change of pace for Craig's Bond girls. I'm not alone in saying I think we the general audience need more Paloma.

Speaking of supporting cast-- the MI6 team really got to shine. I always loved Bond's supporting cast, and I really love how Craig's movies have slowly built up this team of people who truly loves and supports him, starting with just original M and Tanner, and now it's like a whole room full of people. Moneypenny and Q continue to be the highlights of these movies for me-- Q especially got so much development and characterization this time around. I loved that they finally just came right out and said he was gay. I would absolutely watch an M-Q-Moneypenny spinoff show on Amazon starring Ralph Fiennes, Ben Wishaw, and Naomie Harris.

I thought Nomi/007 was great-- it was a nice change of pace to have her be kind of mean, actually-- almost a bully? It's way too common in Bond movies to have the Bond girls end up being deferential to Bond in a ""you're better at this than me"" kind of sexist way, but I like that the movie didn't pull any stunts like that and showed that both James and Nomi are capable agents in different ways-- she's green, but she absolutely earned her 00s. Also, [THOSE SHADES](https://www.jamesbondlifestyle.com/product/adam-selman-x-le-specs-flex-sunglasses) are FIRE.

Finally, that plot/ending. I had a gut feeling early on in this movie that Bond wasn't going to make it out. I think when I saw the scene in Madeleine's house in Norway where Mathilde was revealed, I knew he wasn't leaving this movie alive. But to see it play out the way it did was heartbreaking, and absolutely the best ""final Bond movie"" a Bond actor has had the opportunity to make. Most of the time when a Bond quits, it's between films, so that finality is never reflected in any of the movies. It just picks up where the last one left off, with a new man at the wheel. I really admire Craig's five movies for breaking the wheel and giving 007 a complete beginning, middle, and ending-- it took a lot of work to pick up all of the loose story elements and plot threads from CS, QoS, SF, and SP and weave them all into a ""one last Bond"" story that neatly ties up the entire era in one film. Kudos to Craig for sticking with it and not going out on a low note with Spectre-- I think history is going to be really kind to this movie/era down the road just because it *does* tell a complete ""hero's journey.""",q3nxx2
hg1rcoh,"The whole final act of the movie there was this thought creeping in the back of my head ""My god this movie is so boring"". I'm a huge fan of the series and have seen every other movie atleast 2-3 times. I felt like there were glaring plot holes like many others in this thread mentioned but that's not unusual for this style of action movie. I was really disappointed that they made such a big deal about Nomi(Lashana Lynch) being a badass and it ended up feeling like she was less consequential than Paloma(Ana de Armas) overall. The actors did an amazing job but I felt like there was this overload of melodrama in every scene past the mid point of the second act. It diluted the emotional intensity of more important scenes. Remi Malek was amazing as always but his monologues, while beautifully worded, lacked any sort of punch especially with the backdrop of his character's vague goals. I was so excited and ended up leaving relatively disappointed. I see a lot of people enjoyed it and almost feel like I'm missing something. I think I'm gonna wait a bit and watch it again with a fresh set of eyes",q3nxx2
hg25mwp,"Great movie but... >!Had they let Bond ride off into the sunset with Madeline and his daughter, it would have been a much much better ending IMO.!<",q3nxx2
hg7a4mw,"It started off well enough for the first 40 odd minutes, but then the plot got absurd, tried to do too much and it just dragged for two hours while I was checking my cell phone for the time to see how long there was left. Found the romance cringe worthy, action scenes decent, but none of it seemed to fit that well with the preceding stuff, there was no logical flow from one scene to the next. Some plot points and scenes were just weird and unexplainable >!(WHY did Malek let the kid go? He had the child hostage and his enemies still a current threat, it made zero sense whatsoever !<). 2.5/5.",q3nxx2
hgrysk9,"There were a few films that were linked in some form (TSWLM and Moonraker for example) but this long dragged out emotional backstory of Bond across multiple films is too much. NTTD's plot and narrative, along with pacing was a mess and full of holes that could have been easily avoided, not to mention this created a massive confusion on the nanobot/virus plot.

In addition to the fuzzy plot, because it's a continuation of the very long Craig's Bond, you have tons of references and scenes that you can only get the full context from watching the other films.

To the point of individual movies, they are tons better because you get a full story, whether new to the franchise or a regular and most importantly they are interchangeable with each other. Each film was designed as a singular adventure and you could watch them in nearly any order you wished.

What really annoys me is that they've sacrificed various core characters for zero trade-off to the audience. Felix Leiter dying did what exactly? Didn't add shock factor, just annoyance to myself. To be killed off by some newbie who was a ""baddie"" all along in which was really badly revealed.

Bond dying at the end is the result of the blood vial spilled on him from Safin which was from Madeline Swan. So Swan just forgot to omit to Bond when they met up just before they get onto the boat that ""oh you know that WMD that we've all been on about, yeah he has my blood and DNA"". So because she forgot, he gets blown up. What? lol

Safin in general was a good villain, but so much more needed to be explained - his revenge at the start of the film shows he wants an eye for an eye but also shows he has moral feelings, by saving child Madeline. Fast forward to after him killing Spectre, now he wants to kill the world because why now? Change of the moral feelings, or just an excuse to make Bond be a direct rival.

EDIT: I think we should have seen the attack on Safin's family, having the audience visually experience the trauma Safin went though, would have added depth and an emotional connection, even moral forgiveness to the villain; from the audience which is rare if not ever in a Bond film. The lining up of goals to end Spectre was good on paper but executed poorly, there could have been a way to make Safin a bad person without going ""take over the world"" attitude.

Safin already committed bad illegal things as it was up to the killing of Spectre. Bond and Safin could have had a similar conversation as they had towards the end ^((where Safin says Bond is a like to him)) half way through the story after Cuba, and Bond replying Safin must still pay for other crimes but will let assassination of Spectre go out of common interest and let that fued untwine for the second half.

Romi was just a cocky character and unlikable. I feel it would have been better if they broke into each other and got along in the end. EDIT: I guess on the plane, Romi was nice to Bond giving him 007 codename, but felt forced and in a ""Oh you have it then"" attitude.

Overall it was a very poor attempt of pacing, full of plot holes that drove serious elements of the story, sacrificing characters and even Bond without a good reason to explain.",q3nxx2

hqejkgs,"Rambling and confused writing and direction.  Really nonexistent storytelling... it just stumbles its way from action sequence to action sequence. Unsure of its own tone, is it funny? self-deprecating? serious? sad? silly? it's all of these things and usually at the cost of what could have been an otherwise interesting or poignant moment. Poor excuse for a 'twist' at the end. The worst movie of the Craig era and a pathetic send-off to a very good bond.",q3nxx2
hftbcb2,"I loved this movie and felt like it was a proper ending to Daniel Craig's Bond, giving us a complete character arc. 

>!Still, it was sad to see him go out that way. Bittersweet.!<

This movie is in my top 3 'modern' Bond films, with the other 2 being Casino Royale & Goldeneye. 

My one criticism of the movie is Rami Malek's Safin. The movie just didn't give him much to work with. >!He comes across as rather pathetic and muted. His master plan is vague beyond the bits and pieces of exposition we get from supporting characters.!< 

>!And he is foiled fairly easily. As far as villains go, he had the most deadly weapon and 'beat' Bond technically. I mean, the guy's entire family was killed and he was made into a psychopathic shell of his former self. So even if he didn't have a 'bio'-weapon that was capable of targeting people and spreading uncontrollably on touch, he still got to Bond in a way no other villain has.!<

>!BTW, how is it a bioweapon if it's primary mechanism is powered by nanobots?!<

Ana de Armas was excellent in the film. Her part could have been excised entirely - but she was a fun addition. 

Latasha Lynch was great too. She is really proficient at action scenes. I hope she gets more parts like this or has a future in any upcoming Bond films.

>!Really sad that Daniel Craig's Bond is finished but he got a great send-off.!<",q3nxx2
hftffmz,Good movie but I just can’t stomach James Bond dying. Especially after that emotional roller coaster. God damn,q3nxx2
hftsbxb,"Disappointed with this one.  Plot was flimsy even for a bond film.

Rami with accent felt forced and I was bored when listening to him.  Bond villains should command a presence and I felt none there which doesn't do Rami justice.

I think the dialogue was the weakest point.  To me, Bond doesn't mince words.  He asks pointed questions and chimes in with a smarmy comment every now and then.

During scenes where he engages Rami / Blofeld (prison scene), the way he speaks, his lines, felt like gushing and was very awkward and too verbose for the Bond character.

To summarize, like a fart, it started off strong, then tapered off into a whimper.

7/10",q3nxx2
hfy48a8,"I loved the ending (much more than I loved the movie as a whole), and I loved that Bond died; but something feels so wrong about him just getting absolutely blown to bits rather than a Shakespearean slow death from bullet wounds. It isn’t sitting right with me.",q3nxx2

hgb37ga,"I would pay money to see a spinoff movie of Paloma just doing her thing. Stole the show from the other ""female"" 007 in the few minutes she was onscreen.

I've kind of ""tuned out"" of the Bond series for a while so I had no idea who these people were until I read the whole history after on Wikipedia. I thought Madeleine was Blofield's daughter.",q3nxx2
hftp4qx,"It's the best Bond film Craig has made alongside Casino Royale, and one of the best in the entire franchise. 

Stellar action, wonderful acting (especially from Craig), a great theme song, beautiful locations, and it actually makes an impact into the long-running series in a way that no other Bond has done since On Her Majesty's Secret Service.

It's also going to make so many manbabies angry, and that makes it even better.",q3nxx2
hfvac4u,"That stairwell one shot was exhausting in a not good way. I'm sure it took a lot of work and I'm sure there's a lot that went into it. But it's not innovative anymore, doing it as a one-shot doesn't add anything to the narrative that regular succession of shots wouldn't.


I think it's more in line with the recent trend of 'more directing' having become the default for good directing. Also, a lot of inserts to justify things that don't need justifying. IE the dude getting the call to release the sheep, 007(the black woman, not Bond) escaping the Cubans after she shoots the transformer box, the cargo ship seen earlier in Cuba at the docks that then picks up Bond when he's in the liferaft. I know why it was done, to try to pre-empt criticisms of plotholes, but it only pads out the runtime without contributing anything meaningful.


An enjoyable film without being particularly very good unless you're especially invested in Bond.",q3nxx2
hfygyev,Possibly the most boring Bond movie. Long periods of nothing but contrived dialogue. Plot pieces and characters that ultimately go nowhere. A lot of wasted time.,q3nxx2

Really disappointed in the villain. The motivations didn’t make much sense at all to me. 

Wasn’t a bad movie. But with Mission Impossible and John Wick franchises, the Bond franchise just feels kind of stale.",q3nxx2
hg266um,"Movie was beyond disappointing. I dont even know why she didn't tell him that was his kid. She turned his family into a ""mission"" its sad because it was really good in the beginning but towards the end I lost interest. Especially since he should've lived in the end. His family dying and him being forever ""alone"" would've made more sense just like when Dominic said in QoS ""Everything you touch withers and dies"" Bond is unkillable. That's what made DC so good at it. His death held no weight. Leiters death was poorly executed. Ash was clearly a double agent anyone could see that. The Villain also wasn't really as fleshed out as he should've. Rami did a good job though.",q3nxx2

hg4ztn8,"I don't like that Bond dies.  But my concern is mostly that they are signaling that 007 lives on while Bond dies.  To be honest, I want a chauvinistic, sex-romping, super spy--Bond has never been a role model.  Don't care if he's black, white, or polka-dotted.  

And I'd definitely go see a Jane Bond (edit: James Bond style) movie with Ana De Armas or Lashana Lynch.  But I will boycott that movie if it comes at the cost of the James Bond character.  

So long as the character of James Bond comes back, I don't really care if it becomes a new tradition that Bond dies at the end of an actor's run.",q3nxx2
hfycdzg,"Honestly I did not like it, it did not feel like a Bond film and I hated that ending. Also Safin was such a cheesy villain.",q3nxx2
hg6e2du,"Enjoyed it at first but got bored near the end when all my predictions was right. 

First, there was a brief moment during the train scene were Madeleine touched her belly. I figured out she was pregnant with bond's baby. Then the intro happened and showed a pregnant belly. At that point I was convinced she was definitely pregnant. When I saw the their daughter, at that point I keep thinking that JB is gonna die, but wasn't fully convinced yet. Then when Safin showed Madeleine her the DNA sample in some kind of glass tube, I was so sure that JB will die of nanobots. Then missiles happened. Ending was definitely a great sendoff to this Bond but was kinda disappointed with the foreshadowings.",q3nxx2
hh5wkip,"As with most movies produced nowadays - this wasn't a great movie. Bond-movies in general requires the viewer to suspend their disbelief for a bit but this movie made it really hard to do. This had to do with both the weak plot and the usually most redeeming part of any Craig Bond-movie: The action. Don't get me wrong; it was spectacular. But James Bond survived 3(!) explosions to the face. Besides that, this movie had a very sloppy plot-line - like some of the other Craig-movies. There wasn't much chemistry between Craig and Seydoux. The humor fell flat for the most part. Maybe the worst part was Malek's villain Safin. He had no clear motive, we have no idea how he had the ability and resources to take down Spectre and in the end didn't really challenge Bond at all. Overall, the movie just kinda dragged on for me and I feel they could have done so much more.

Some upsides from this movie were the car-chase scene's and overall action, Paloma, and the Felix-plot. The new 007 was a very interesting addition that didn't get explored enough because she had no impact on the entire story that couldn't have been solved with a dead man's switch. To me, Blofeld stole the show. Waltz had a very minor role but - as always - stole the show.

I think most of the issues of this movie could have been solved by just splitting it up into two movies. One to explore the Felix plot and set up Safin. The other to explore Bond's new role as a part of both his old and his new family.",q3nxx2
hmcsofn,"Man this movie was a stinker.

The premise was flimsy.

Some of it was poorly acted in a bad way.

It was like watching an episode of the office I kept thinking Daniel Craig was gonna look into the camera like Jim. It's hard to fuck up a bond movie this bad but boy did they go out of their way to do just that. Craig didn't play the character as james bond he played james bond as an every man but that isn't james bond. No explanation as to why bond was lied to about his daughter. Also bond getting obliterated is not something I ever want to see again. Craig's bond will forever be remembered as joyless, soulless and filled with despair. After all the other bond movies you watch them and you fantasize about being a spy but after every Craig movie it was just so dour. Glad his era is over and they need to bring the franchise back and make it FUN again.

They baited me with ana de armas I thought she was gonna be the bond girl.",q3nxx2
hk5zm1l,"I thought the movie sucked. 

First of all, I can't stand James Bond's plot armor in 2021 anymore. The only reason the movie ended the way it did is because Craig won't be involved again. Bond is not a special agent, he's more like a bullet God with autoaim cheats. At some point you just laugh at how bad everyone else is with guns...including soldiers! 

The action scenes are mostly uninspired. One example is when Bond' gets surrounded by 10+ people and they start shooting at his car. But no one thought maybe, just maybe shoot at the tires instead of trying to destroy what are basically otherwordly bulletproof windows (on a car!). 

Another bad scene is when Bond escapes the sinking boat BY OPENING A HATCH DOOR WHILE UNDERWATER! I guess the laws of physics don't apply in this movie. 

The dichotomy between being a grounded movie and cartoonesque action sequences makes for a rather strange duo. 

There are also a lot of moments in the movie where I felt the characters just made the worst possible decisions, including when Safin let the little girl escape *even though she was her best bargaining chip against Bond*. Big WTF moment. 

Honestly felt like the movie was too long and didn't know what it wanted to achieve. It failed to convey Bond as someone who isn't just a killing machine. It failed to portray an interesting vilain (revenge plots are high on the cliché list). Most importantly, it failed to entertain me. It's hard going back to such Hollywood cash grabs when you've been spoiled with movies that feature actually good cinematography and not jump cuts.",q3nxx2

The songs in the Daniel Craig era start with a classic then get progressively worse (can't listen to Sam Smith's & can't even remember the last one).
All this WOKE nonsense is absurd  read the novels, Bond is a man & is broken by his love & betrayal by Vesper Lynd then finds love with Tracey & revenge monster after she is killed.

hft2ug1,"So a movie that was delayed three times by a pandemic involved a plot...about releasing a pandemic? 

I think this was kind-of *On Her Majesty's Secret Service* call back - as soon as Bond said ""We have all the time in the world"" I was thinking ""Uh oh"" but they *sUBVeRTeD EXPEcTAtIonS* by killing Bond. Towards the end I was expecting Madeleine and Bond to die leaving orphan Mathilde...to be a new super-spy? **Ana de Armas as Paloma kicked ass and was the only true Bond action scene in this.** Rami Malek as Safin was wasted: he wasn't threatening or menacing and somehow manages to kill off all-powerful Spectre. 

I grew up watching Classic Bond and saw every Bond movie since ""A View to a Kill"" at the cinema. Ending with ""We Have all the Time in the World"" is probably a sly goodbye from the Broccoli family now that Amazon owns MGM...and Bond. James Bond Cinematic Universe anyone?",q3nxx2

hk5j5v2,"Craig's final Bond was worth the wait, providing a clean, well-flowing plot filled with the well-choreographed stunts, car chases, and gunfights one expects, as well as a proper send-off for Craig, whose gritty, humanizing portrayal of the titular character reinvigorated the franchise and was on full display here.

The only downside to Ana de Armas' performance is that there was so little of it. As charming and delightful as ever, she plays an enthusiastic rookie agent who shows up, does her job well, and is thanked for her service, which I imagine is the franchise's way of broadcasting its intentions with respect to the role of future ""Bond Girls"". I.e. They intend to give the female agents some agency, which is great. Also fortunate is the fact that Ana does at least leave us with a tease about ""staying longer next time,"" hinting that we may see her character again in future installments.",q3nxx2

I don't mean that it was the best in the series (to me, You Only Live Twice still has that honor), but that it successfully balanced out all the different directions James Bond has gone in over the years.  It wasn't too goofy or too serious; the amount of gadgets and the amount of humor was just right, too.

Of all the villains over the past 60 years, how tf do they give credit for the death of James Bond to this weak fucking villain. I know he didn’t deal the final blow per se but man, he should not have been able to touch him compared to other villains he’s bested.

Why kill him at all? Isn’t he deserving of some kind of happy ending?

I dunno man I just felt it was unnecessary. Emotional, of course, but just didn’t feel like it served any purpose at that point. He was already more than done and his replacement had already been found. Why die and give the already dead villain his victory?

Why was M so surprised when Bond showed up in Cuba? Naomi (007) also, for that matter? She told him to meet her. She didn't tell M that she ran into Bond?

Why did they (Safin and co) spare Bond's life ? They had to know that he would want to know wtf was going on after all of that and come after them.

Why was Safin so mad at Bond? Because Madeline loved him and not Safin? 

Was anyone else annoyed with Safin's line, ""look what you made me do"" when he smashed the vial against Bond's face? He planned on killing Bond to protect his poison island and product. It wasn't like James would see him with a gun and say ""Oh well then, bye!"" I know for the story line it had to happen but seemed a bit stupid. As if he had no intention of killing Bond when we know better?


I'd love to see Lashana Lynch continue as 007. Yes I know that wouldn't make the character James Bond anymore. They already have a great cast with Q, Money Penny and M (well ok he's mostly ok), I'd hate to see them scap that cast and start over.

But I don’t want to just focus on the death. This was a GREAT Bond film. It had everything. The action was the best it’s ever been. Cary Fukunaga, you goddamn genius. He delivered the goods with this one. I loved Bond and 007 storming the base. Two elite operatives taking on dozens and dozens of people. Also having a new 007 was a fresh take. 

They rectified the relationship between Bond and Madeleine. They put more work into that first 10/15 mins of this movie than the entirety of Spectre.

Absolutely loved this film and can’t wait to see it again. Still can’t believe it. And all the previous Bond theme touches with the score were much appreciated. The OHMSS stuff was just pure bliss.

If they had scrapped that from Skyfall it would make him dying in NTTD less problematic for the franchise as the next 007 will either have to explain why he took the James Bond name as a codename or it be a bizarre coincidence that he is also named JB.

hgg06v9,"Question: when Rami slashed James with the vile, what did it do?",q3nxx2
hgzsaau,"I'm a tad mixed on this one. I love James Bond and Craig's tenure, but the ending definitely left me unsatisfied. I was hoping for a sort of Dark Knight Rise's ending, where he survives and just goes off into the sunset. I feel like the character deserved it.

As for the film itself; it was very well made, though one of the slower ones with much more personal monologues. It did feel like they wanted to tie off all the character lines, rather than set it up for the future, which is also sad to see lovable characters leave. 

I found the villain and technology interesting, and loved the classic lair setting, but I was also a bit confused about how the nanobots actually worked with the targeting. I think they should have had some antidote vials to increase the stakes and allow Bond to survive.

One scene I need to re-watch is the Blofeld encounter. Throughout it felt like Bond knew he got something on his hands due to how he delivered the whole monologue with just his right hand out. It felt deliberate and almost a bit unnatural. He also made note of Swann shaking. But then he was surprised when Blofeld died, so I guess he actually didn't(?). 

This issue of ambiguity is something I noticed throughout with a few of the characters. Even M gave me baddy vibes at one point, because of the whole Heracles thing and his unwillingness to cooperate. Not sure if the ambiguity was on purpose or a result of bad scripting.

Overall it was a great movie and beautifully shot, but it felt a bit shallow. Just had something off, like they knew where it would lead from the get go. Even when he meets Felix, they hint at it being the end. And when he tells Swann and Nomi that he'd be back in a minute...its laying it on thick that he's likely gone. I don't like when they make it obvious what to expect, just pumping up the dread for two hours so when the character finally goes it just confirms it rather than surprises you. Alas, that's probably a very personal peeve. A re-watch should help see where it ranks.

Would like to see if I'm not alone in some of these observations of the movie.",q3nxx2
hk8w2zx,"Finally saw it. It sits between Casino Royale/Skyfall, and QoS/Spectre, which is a copout that doesn't tell you much. If people want a good action romp a la Spectre, or a 21st century look at a 70s Bond film, they'll like it. 

It was a little too ridiculous for me, and to me, Bond is at its best during  the moody, introspective CR/Skyfall films, where he actually ages rather than get stronger. But if you like the cars, the gadgets, and supersoldier John Wick posing as Bond, you'll like it. 

I question whether Bond is actually for me, since the films I like most are the least Bond-like. It's like if my favourite superhero flicks were Super and Kick-Ass. Then again, the box office of Skyfall suggests otherwise.

I still don't get why he settled with Swann. They look like father and daughter when together. Vesper felt so out of place being mentioned. Please don't bring better films into the discussion, like Spectre retconning everything.

It's long but that's to be expected of spy thrillers where you get bounced from place to place, lead to lead. Just cut down the number of places and leads, and you can make it 2 hours or even less. 

Speaking of, I've already seen the race/gene bomb created by British intelligence years ago in a show called Spooks. That's what British spies are called, and in the show, the Chinese get it, only to find it doesn't work. But they keep that a secret from other nations for deterrence. 

Villain was dumb. Had no plan. Kill the world, because ""people want to be ruled"". Make him an ecoterrorist or something. Also, his ""love"" of Swann, considering he met her as a child, is even more problematic. He's a plot device, with no motive beyond ""crazy"". A rogue AI could replace him. Did the white mask even mean anything in the end?

Then you get the Bond references: the killcam, Bond, James Bond, shaken not stirred. That and tying up all loose ends. It felt like ASM, with Spiderman building web shooters and quipping, because those were complaints in Raimi's films. ""Make it more Bond like. More cheese. Magnet gadgets. Villains with terrible accents.""

Maybe I need to rewatch the other films, but Craig felt disinterested while saying his lines. He brought out emotion when needed, but for the rest of it, he seemed bored. Given his history, like saying he'd rather slit his wrists than do another Bond film, it seems it finally got to him.

In the end Bond went out with a whimper. Skyfall was a better place to end. It felt like the Transformers pentalogy. 1st film was the best, 2nd was shit, 3rd redeemed the 2nd, and closed off the trilogy. Then 2 vaguely-related films come after, that may as well be a soft reboot.",q3nxx2

hisomvi,"Considering I've only somewhat seen Casino Royale  and never watched Quantum of Solace, my impression is basically based on my first film being Skyfall, watching a few of the older movies after and watching SPECTRE.


As far as this era goes, it's better than SPECTRE by a mile, but that's not hard to do when that movie is horrible fanfiction loaded with fanservice.  Mostly because of several reasons.


- Billie Ellish's theme. Between the mumbling and the songwriting, this song should've never been produced like it was. It was worse than Sam Smith's whiny SPECTRE theme because it lacked personality.  For a final film in an era ,it was very anticlimactic. The songwriters didn't do the singer justice. 


- The standard Bond villain doesn't fit in a story centered around realism. It'd be like if The Dark Knight Rises all of a sudden inserted all the supernatural elements and now this plot contrivance now exists to conveniently heal Bruce Wayne of his wounds. All the while they fight like Power Rangers  amidst massive explosions to the sound of the 66 Batman theme by Van Halen. I don't expect this to be a standard Bond film, and I didn't want that. 


- The pseudoscientific garbage creates far too many plot conveniences, >!and tarnishes M in the process!<. It was more befitting a latter Moore Era film like A View To A Kill, than the realism Casino Royale established. If this crap existed in the previous films, why was it never alluded to whatsoever? Now SPECTRE is all dead because apparently they solely consist of a small party of people?  Why would such an organization waste all their best agents at one location?  


- Stop with the interconnected bullshit. Why does Rami Malek's character need to be connected and solely defined by revenge against SPECTRE to do his acts? Why does Blofeld need to be James Bond's adoptive brother to want to stop and kill Bond? SPECTRE was so sloppily retconned in this era that of course, they had the genius idea of killing them all off to wipe the slate clean despite being this massive threat that controlled all the criminal enterprises. How does Rami Malek's character know SPECTRE in the first place if he's not written to be a part of it when no one else knew they existed? And if he knew they existed, why isn't there this massive power struggle between the villain and Blofeld? Why isn't Blofeld forced to work with MI6 to get rid of a bigger threat instead of lurking around places? That would've been a far better way of utilizing Blofeld instead >!of killing him off and turning M into a bioterrorist!<. 


- As much as I liked the female 00, I found the plot contrivances that inorganically propped her up while tearing the pre-existing characters down to be frankly boring. The problem is that the new 007 *doesn't* need any of this nonsense because in every single scene she's in, her stellar performance can hold her own just fine. I rolled my eyes when the Russian scientist made the snide comment of wiping out black people with the drug and her kicking him into the water. He was already an unscrupulous person for helping the tyrannical antagonist pulling a Thanos.  It felt like the writers were like ""oh, he's evil, so let's re-frame her reasoning as merely wanting only black people dead.""  Let's pile on the reasons other than him being cowardly scientist and weaken her character in the process.  All she did was cost the world of an asset that could develop a cure. It was a minor nitpick, though because it could be explained as not taking his shit, but still. That's just lazy writing because they had nothing left to do with the scientist.

Seemed like a weak reason for Bond to have to sacrifice his life.

would've been cleaner and easier to understand if Safin had just decided he was going to release the poison without DNA targeting, and potentially kill off the entire world. And Bond had to blow up the facility before a count down launch or something.",q3nxx2

Paloma character was great. I wish we could have seen her more and Felix too. The CIA part was a great idea, but I didn't really understand what's going on between the MI6 and the CIA.

The vilains were great, but I don't understand why they want to kill all humanity. Like what's the point to kill everyone? Also, it's been so many years since the last movie that I didn't understand the first 15 minutes of the movies with all the vilains trying to kill Bond.

I liked some of the Bonds like GoldenEye and Casino Royale. In GoldenEye there were many distinct characters other than Bond, such as Dimitri, Boris, Ouromov and of course 006. This movie didn't have that. 

There were way too many scenes stuffed in this run time, they completely underutilized Malek and Madeleine. Madeleine was a complete mess the entire movie, it was almost parody.

Too much of the film made me think of Austin Powers.

I really don't understand how people connected with any of the characters in this film.",q3nxx2

Plot was all over the place and just killed off characters after characters for shock value because Craig time is ending, not cause the story demanded it.",q3nxx2
hftorbd,"I was good movie, just slightly above the Spectre for me. The pacing was bad. I know it was Craig’s last movie and they had to give him the happy ending and they achieved it. The Forest scene is one the best Bond’s scene. The villain and his intentions felt very weak, it’s like he was barely in the movie. It was a good watch tho. They should have focused may be a little bit less on love story part and little more on Malek’s character. 7/10 from me",q3nxx2

hfty8pg,"Honestly, I was very disappointed with this film.
The acting, visuals and action were all top notch. I enjoyed the new 007 a lot and her dynamic with Bond was fun. Ana de Armas was amazing but completely wasted.

I hated the plot. Rami Malek was utterly wasted as one of the worst villains I have ever seen. The villain (who was so dull I can’t remember his name) had no motivations, no passion and he was hardly in the film. The plot revolving around magic nanomachines that could poison certain types of blood was stupid. Also, the entire second act was very boring; existing just to spout exposition about the same plot points over and over.

Bond’s relationship with Madeline and his daughter felt underbaked and unearned. However, I thought Bond’s death was well done and felt it was a fitting sendoff for this Bond.
Overall 4/10",q3nxx2
hg48seg,"Unfortunately, this movie was not at all what I wanted from a James Bond movie. Daniel Craig did a good job, but the writing didn't give him any of the wit, charm and assholery seen in his previous movies. I also was hoping for him to do more espionage and outsmart his opponents. The closest I could think of in this movie was when he tied up the rope to the trees in the forest and the henchman ran into it. Overall, I wanted this movie to be more fun and it ending up being so dour instead. 

It felt like it took itself too seriously to have such a goofy plot that involved nanobots and DNA technology, and I wasn't a fan of the switch to Hans Zimmer scoring the movie. I used to like his work, but the music felt generic this time around. I thought the previous Craig film scores all had some personality that made them unique. 

Of course, there were some positives to the movie. Technically, it was very well made and the stairwell sequence people were describing was top notch. I also thought the tension and buildup to coming face-to-face with Blofeld at the prison was well done, along with the opening sequence with Madeline and Safin. That jump scare of Safin in the mask looking inside the house was gold. The whole Cuba sequence was probably my favorite section of the movie, because it felt like an actual spy thriller at that point. 

Finally, the decision to kill Bond at the end.. I just can't get over that. It feels like a slap in the face to the legacy of 007. This is a movie I do not care to revisit, and makes Spectre look pretty good in comparison. Casino Royale is my favorite movie of all time, so maybe I just wanted a return to that Bond over what we got.",q3nxx2

hhqojwm,"To be honest I think they fucked up. They built up this phenomenal story of ""Bond"" had entire movies dedicated to his back story, then kill him. 

They made certain the next chapter will bomb no matter who takes the role. To invest so much in a character it would have been better to have a ride off into the sunset sort of ending. 

Due to the character development around Bond and not 007, they have officially killed Bond.

This was a bad move, but whatever nobody asked me",q3nxx2
hg5hqqg,"Between Craig saying he didnt like Bond films to the years and years of 'development hell' that plagued this saga, Im really looking forward to moving on from this Bond. Onto bigger and better. Also,  I always thought the unnecessary killing of characters was a cop out from writers to gain cheap emotions and I cant help but feel this is what they went for here. Perhaps Criag requested it or whatever but I felt Bond should be untouchable in that respect. I dont think the character should belong to any one writer/director to make that decision. Now I fear we'll get dead Bonds at the end of each actor's tenure.",q3nxx2

hg0gtfg,"As a conclusion to the Craig Era, I felt it was really satisfying.

As it’s own movie, it was a generic Bond film.

It hits the usual plot points, and honestly, it can be a standard Bond movie, and I can still enjoy myself, but as a finale, I wanted really great. We got good enough.

I don’t wanna shit on it too hard, because it’s still leaps and bounds ahead of the truly generic Bond movies we’ve had before. frankly, it’s leaps and bounds ahead of most action movies, but “I’ve seen worse” isn’t exactly a good minimum standard.

What really irks me is the villain. I know everyone is saying it, but he honestly sucked. He and Bond have basically no personally connection, beyond “you killed my girlfriend’s mom like 20 years ago after my girlfriend’s dad killed your whole fucking family.” That’s weak.

I was really expecting a villain Bond could relate too. He saves Bond’s life, destroys Spectre, kills Blofeld. By the end of act 2, this dude was basically Bond’s hero. What if when they finally met, he gave Bond every reason to walk away. Like, instead of genocide, he tells him he’s going to use the virus to ensure a group like Spectre never exists again. If anyone comes after Bond, he kill his attackers, thereby guaranteeing his families safety forever. When Bond ultimately has to fight him, he’d be giving up a lot, because he’s ultimately a good person.

But no, we get another “vague motive for genocide” villain. Another “I’m a good person” villain that makes both characters and audience go “no, your clearly fucking not!” Another generic villain for Bond to dispatch, with basically no reason for us to care.

This movie kinda blew it in the ninth, huh?

That said, I’m glad they had the balls to kill Bond. It was a really logical place for the story to go, and it felt like he was one deaths door the whole movie. They committed, and I respect that.",q3nxx2

hg27qe4,"This movie had plenty of plot holes and things that didn’t quite work, but damn it got me.

The callback to the driving on a road with “All the time in the world” playing as a callback to OHMSS was excellent and filled me with dread. There was also a subtle music motif of On Her Majesty’s Secret Service theme played later on which was really powerful.

Plus the Aston Martin , it was all just a great nod and then they went and flipped it , giving him the send off rather than killing the love interest. My wife remarked how Daniel Craig’s bond is much more of a committed relationship guy in these sequence of movies and it’s really true.  Tracy Bond is the only other one that compares.",q3nxx2

hg547qg,"I think I can improve this movie!

1. Start this movie right in Italy at the train scene we don't need the narrative re-establishment of Bond and Swann's relationship. Leave it unclear why Bond is leaving her there.

2. Leave out the scene where comical russian scientist reprograms the nanobots. Still show him using the computer to weaponise the stuff but leave it so we still think it's a biological weapon. Everyone but Bond dies, Blofield baffled, mystery ensues.

3. Keep the Safin therapy scene where it is, no explanation yet as to their relationship or why the mask freaked her out. 

4. After the moment he meets Swann again at the prison, have Nomi question Bond as to what happened that made her leave her, or have some excuse to flashback to Italy, show them on vacation without the 'secrets' dialogue in a slow music montage. Play out that action sequence. Can still have him at Vesper's grave, paying his respects as some sort of road trip on his way to retire.
*Side note, would've been great if that Nokia phone actually kept working after the blast

5. After the prison scene, have M explain Herakles, it might actually occur afterwards already, but I can't remember. In any case, this is when the audience should learn about the programmable nanobots. 

6. At the cabin, Swann can explain her history with Safin, play that assasination flashback scene. Let Swann go a little psychoanalytic explaining Safin's connection/attraction/fixation with her. Reveal the Bond child, no lies. Add in a bit of dialogue/interaction wherein Bond promises to end it once and for all so they can live in piece. Like in Casino, he sees a way out in that child. A door marked exit, like he though Vesper was. 

7. In the cargo plane, when Nomi asks Bond be given back his 007 moniker. Have him in return have an earnest conversation with her about the nature of the job, the toll it takes, and ask her if she's truly ready for what's to be asked of her. Have her seriously reply that she is respectfully accepting his concern, and then comically also say that they first have survive this mission.

8. Remove the insurance nanobots scene. Honestly this movie has too many chekov's guns. It'd be perfectly find for Safin to reveal what it is he scratched Bond with right after he scratches Bond.

9. In his speech to Bond while holding his kid hostage, which honestly like some of the dialogue in the film I couldn't quite make out what he was saying, make his rationale that he tried to take revenge on Swann for her father did to his family, but it was in that moment when he took mercy and saved Swann, where his mentality switched and in his twisted way he wanted save humanity ever since, firstly by taking down all of Spectre. When Spectre went after the nanobots, that's when opportunity presented itself. I forget what it was that his family was involved in? Maybe development biological weapons from the plants or something but that could play into the 'legacy' dialogue.

10. Finish per norm!",q3nxx2

- The 15-minute cold open set the tone for the movie. The emotional arc, the action and the length of the movie!
- Action was really good!
- Cinematography was fantastic! Some of the close-up shots and that one-take action sequence to get to the control room is my favorite!
- Movie had great pacing. Didn't even like a 2hr 40min.
- Ana de Armas killed it in her 10-minute cameo! She had great co-worker chemistry with Daniel Craig
- Some of the dialogues were really funny! Can see Phoebe Waller-Bridge's stamp on them

hg0gsnl,"Although I’m 23, I’ve seen every Bond film, and read all of the books plus young Bond(even played the video games on the PS2 and 360…); In my honest opinion, I believe this was the best Bond film…

Every scene was fluid, I was on edge the whole time, and just appreciated the masterpiece it was…With Daniel in this film, we get to see a truly emotionally vulnerable side of Bond that we don’t normally see…I feel like this film completes Bond(as a person, mentally) as well, and it helps us appreciate him more…This emotionally vulnerable Bond, completes him as a whole…It shows truly, how human he is, and that it fuels him and his drive; In Japanese there is a term called Ikigai, which means, “Ones reason for being”…Their purpose…Their why…This term perfectly summarizes Bonds arch…Although he has experienced so much loss, grief, death of others he’s cared about, and trauma, he learns from the past…Understands it, and grows from it, mentally…Using his past friendships and relationships to fuel his purpose, along with his new relationship…We get to see him as a father, and although I was on edge emotionally for the whole film, when he picked up the stuffed animal, I knew that it was his end as time is crucial between life and death. This is something a previous Bond wouldn’t have done, but I appreciated because it shows he cares about his daughter(I cried there…smh…)

With that being stated, Rami Malek’s “villain”, perfectly balanced out the film and Bond…Both are uncannily similar…Both I appreciate and understand…Everything I mention in the conclusion of my summary of this Bond is true of Rami…He has also experienced a tremendous amount of loss, grief, death and heartache at such a young age with the loss of his family…But where Bond is able to grow and become a better person for it, Rami doesn’t…He holds on to this and fuels his desire for revenge, although justified in the beginning with regards to specter, he goes too far from the standpoint of playing god(this poisoned him in a sense…)…I agree with Malek that evil should be despised and exterminated but you cannot fight fire with fire…Unfortunately his choice of ridding the world of evil would unknowingly or knowingly be effecting others related to the individuals he wishes to kill, that otherwise are innocent…The loss of innocent lives shouldn’t come at the hand of extinguishing evil…His principle I agree with, but his actions, and being overcome by a passion for revenge is not the correct way…Essentially him and Bond took different paths to reach similar outcomes to fight evil…And both met the same ends to a mean…Essentially this was the most important villain to help Bond find his sense of purpose; Much like Joker to Batman…

In closing, this was the greatest Bond film made, especially from a meaning standpoint through and through…There is so much to learn from this film, and each of the characters fulfill that in a sense…It truly was a pleasure to watch this masterful work of art…From dialogue, to the writing, cinematography, actors, the underlying message, Hans Zimmer and his background music, to even Billie Eilish and her opening song(which suits the movie meaning and tone(her voice suits it perfectly as well))…Besides this, I can relate to the movie a lot, with regards to my ex, the death of family/friends I cared about, the emotional trauma and mental struggles…This movie felt like a piece of me, and gave me insight on how to overcome and find purpose from not just the failures or mistakes of others, but also what you can learn from those before you that made an impact on you…With that, I’d give it a 10, and would highly recommend this film to anyone(even if they don’t understand who Vesper or Spectre is for background…)",q3nxx2

The entire movie leans into this idea by ripping sets, scenes, costumes, direction, cinematography, gameplay mechanics, even bugs, and acting styles from popular games... and it works very well if you've spent hundreds of hours immersed in these games, but if you haven't got the memories of ""been there, and done that"" then the hook will not work on you.

The last 2 or so of pierce brosman were barely ok and when craig hit the screen he looked like a common thug.  i know bond is supposed to be basically a killing machine but i never liked craig in this role.  i hope the producers/writers/etc. will try to find a nobody to fill the shoes and it really needs to be a man.  i don't think fleming meant it to be a woman.  but anyway these are my thoughts.,q3nxx2
hqhewl6,"Seeing some mixed reactions here.

Some like it, some hate it.

Me personally its a decent Bond movie. Nothing mind-blowing/new that we haven't seen before from the James Bond Formula, theres action (Of course) good scenes, a bit of laughter here and there but something just felt ''off'' and I can't really pin-point as to why.

The villian was definitely interesting yet dry at the same time, I just wished he had a bit more screen time to really flesh out his character, couldn't say I cared much about him..

Since this is a spoiler thread im going to cut to the chase and admit that I wasn't to upset about the way Bond died. Sometimes going over dramatic is to much. I know some are upset about the way he got killed off.

Personally im more sad about the future of this franchise and hope to god the feminist director & narrative doesn't ruin the future Bond movies or its a wrap for me alongside Craigs death...",q3nxx2

hg27o4k,"If you’re gonna kill James Bond, there’s no better way to do it. The fan service homage to OHMSS, self-sacrifice, and excellent acting made it the perfect way to kill off James Bond.

Only problem is *they killed off James Freakin’ Bond*. The reboot was meant to show Bond grow into the spy we knew. The spy we knew doesn’t die. He’s James Bond! Spectre was how this thing meant to end. I enjoyed the ride, but when the missle silo opens, it falls below Quantum of Solace IMO.",q3nxx2

hgkgoqy,"The movie was enjoyable in action and in my opinion has the best theme song which shares the same tone with the movie in contrast to Skyfall and Spectre which in my opinion have songs that sound darker than the movie although the darkest one being was Adele's Skyfall. What I think makes this movie stands out in the first 13 to 15 years after Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace is how this movie doesn't focus on Bond's past too much. The action is great with the way Fukunaga imagines it.

This movie however does have its' flaws being a rushed movie that ran for two hours that needs to do better with character development which barely tries to focus on other characters while action has at least some concentration in the movie. The scientist has more of a silly personality than a delusional one. Ana de Armas's scene was too short as for a long movie for being over 2 hours alongside the fact her character wasn't that serious as a Bond woman which in my opinion hurts the tone of a Bond movie. On the the other hand, Logan Ash as a character wasn't given much time before his revelation of being a mole for Safin nor was he obscure enough about it. Safin as a villain is completely underdeveloped and there is not really enough backstory to him other than the fact Madeline's father (Mr. White) murdered his entire family. While Safin as a villain is great especially with personalityy, his history and rivalry with Spectre isn't developed well enough having Rami and Lea's age difference being 4 years apart in which he doesn't age unless his character is older by at least 8 years. As much as to this movie, I feel that Cary Joji Fukunaga was a good choice for directing this movie and even the screenplay as well especially for the action, but at some points in the movie with the character development was where I feel Mendes did a better job at in contrast to Fukunaga. Fukunaga although at the same time after watching the movie I feel that the top two choices if it was up to me for directing this movie would be F. Gary Gray (Law Abiding Citizen and Fate of the Furious) or Leigh Whannell (Invisible Man and Upgrade) could've taken over Mendes's  spot with the tones and action sequences that they used in their movies especially since Gray's direction for car chases in F8 could have worked out in No Time to Die in my opinion although I'd pick Whannell to control the tone in the movie from the Invisible Man.

Mine:

1.	Skyfall - Adele (*Skyfall*)
2.	You Know My Name - Chris Cornell (*Casino Royale*)
3.	Another Way to Die - Alicia Keys & Jack White (*Quantum of Solace*)
4.	Writing’s on the Wall - Sam Harris (*Spectre*)
5.	No Time to Die - Billie Eilish (*No Time to Die*)

Intro: Classic James bond Intro visual and sonically, a few years ago I would of loved to hear the Radio head version of the Song but I think Billy’s version really stuck with me. A good majority of the time if im able to hear the music and see the visuals of the bond movies on the big screen im happy. 

Music: Zimmer is the goat. 

Actors: D.Crieg is the bond for my generation and he can do no wrong for until someone proves to be better so with this I have no Gripes. I will admit he did not come off as smooth as previous movies, but I can understand that maybe implied that he is getting older and retired so yes you will get beat up abit and I can accept that. I also love love how toward the end they give him his final send off with the iconic quick pistol shot and pose one of my fav parts
 Ana De Armas – Thought she did a great job and that length of the character was even better, Just enough to get the point across, and kept me wanting more of her but at the same time it was the perfect amount of time. 

Waltz/Malek – Any movie they are in they kill their role, enjoyed them; although I would say there was not much villain development, I got less from the villain and more from the technology they were tring to secure  

007/Q- (Disclaimer Black male) I think they ticked  all the Boxes here, African American female playing 007 (Not Bond) and Q being open about his Sexuality ( Dinner Scene, he said this is the 1st time he is coming over) im not sure in any other movies this was broadcasted. Never the Less I thought 007 was a great character, would I want to see the next 15-20 years of 007 Movies with her as the main 007, no but I enjoyed her role and character.   I would personally love to to Idris Alba.

Ending: Bond having a Kid, This chain of story line kind leaves me confused because it does not open the gates for any other Bond ( not 007) of other Races/Genders ( Going back to my fandom of Idris Alba) To carry the last name bond assuming James did die, the franchise can only continue with his Daughter or only being a 007 with no James bond, and I cant see that happening, often times we say “im going to see the new James bond movie” rather then the ew 007 movie.  And to have his daughter be the New Bond would have to place the movie 15 years into the future, which does allow for proper ageing of existing characters.  So it would be interesting to see how they do things.

When the movie started with the attack and all, i expected, the daughter is not Bond's, but Safin. Seriously, how he knew a whole DNS code at the ending, if not his daughter? Not only this but connect the trailer and song, i was expecting a kill or die fight scene between Bond and Swann. Thinking on this ending. They destroy Safin, go happily. But Bond get a phone call from deceased Blofield. If he hears this, he dead and he must know the Spectre will reborn with Swann. While hear this, Swann already hold a gun at Bond. They try to talk but useless, the 2 gun face each other. And... They both shoot. Bond saying he still serves her majesty, and Swann saying she still owes this to Safin and her father, they both die. Spectre is gone, Bond is gone. No one wins. As every ""war"" the ending says, there is no winning side. Something like this. I missed a real WTF moment. The daughter? Don't try to guess how much children is out there from Bond, right? Right. Not to mention, lot of little evidence shown Swann was too close with Spectre all the time, and even with purpose asked when Bond see the records of Wesper Lynd, what's wrong. She knew that, but how if not involved. Also about Blofield. I hate he was gone that fast. It would be more interesting or shocking, and unexpected, if he and Bond help each other hunt down Safin, making a ""shadow partnership"" with Bond. Or even with MI6. So while it was sad ending, and the world is saved, I'm little disappointed what was done with all the previous story. Now we have someone who controled Safin, and now the newborn Spectre, but hopefully at one point we see Mathilde takes revenge for her father. Good question tho, on which side.

Firstly, nanobots can be disabled using MRI or a strong magnetic field, so the idea that you can manipulate nanobots to kill someone with a specific DNA type is moot.

Secondly, James Bond seemed perfectly fine in the penultimate scene at the pond where he is supposedly ""infected"" by nanobots that would kill his lover and daughter, but according to the writers, nanobots or the ""Heracles"" nanobot viral infection can only be directed at similar DNA, so his lover Madeline wouldn't be affected at all.

He walked away from the scene, so obviously he wasn't ""infected"" otherwise he would've died since it infects his own DNA LOL!

Then of course, he makes a call saying he's not going to make it, but damn! He's stupid. He's not even infected with the nanobots because he's still alive talking to her LOL!

Whatever, dude died for nothing. Could've just had an MRI scan to disable the nanobots, or maybe his magnetic watch already disabled them, but Q gave him the wrong info.

Hence end of James Bond, because the guy obviously knows nothing about medical technologies, and had to rely on info from a dorky French-British dude who obviously doesn't have a clue about how nanobots work.

Bond dies and there are many loopholes in the story. Here are some:-

\- Bond is not a family man character - don't make him one.  He was not designed to fall in love with some surly French woman and have a kid.

\- Even if you are contaminated with some whatever nano-nonsense that could kill your wife if you touch your wife, do you actually go commit suicide JUST because you cannot touch her? Grow up. Wear a glove and touch her. Oh, and you have a goddam kid. Be responsible at least. Stick around, work and pay for her bills.

\- Bond is to the service of the nation. To kill oneself just because he risk infecting his wife is very very definition of failing to do one's job, which is to save the world and NOT die. To die because of you cannot touch your wife is rather silly, moronic, professionally dubious and weak.

\- How did the villain get so rich?

\- What does growing plant have to do with the nano-nonsense?

\- Why is the bad scientist a Russian  who speaks with a Russian accent?

\- Why does the villain let the kid go bad to bond?

hfydx5p,"Having watched all bond movies multiple times, I can give this movie a best score of 2 but to express myself here are my thoughts

- the movie was a solid 9 / 10 until the scene where we daughter appeared and it all turned into a father to protect his family movie which imo is NOT what a bond movie should be (however a comment pointed out he has a kid in the books)

- the whole movie is revolved around empowering woman, growing Bonds 'weak man' attitude we have seen in basically all of Craig's Bonds and does not really fit with the cool man saving the day we enjoyed for the last 50 years (empowering woman is important don't get me wrong but it should not be squeezed into an existing Francise like they did with Ghost Busters, instead they should grow francises on their own like Black Widow)

- I loved the action scenes, especially Italy and Cuba

- Ana de Amas was amazing, should have been the new Bond girl

- Walz Performance was 10/10 but he was under utilised

- the Hommage to previous Bond movies was amazing (Dr. No Intro, referring to 'we have all the time in this world' from Her Majesty Secret Service and content wise from Casino Royale and Spectre

- THERE IS NO NEED TO KILL BOND, in all of the previous handovers between Bond actors, they never made a fuss about it. Everyone knows there is a new actor coming, there is no need to explain that to anyone

- It was really unnecessary to kill of characters like Felix since it did not influence the story in a major way (think back to license to kill where the wounding of Felix sparks the whole plot from the get go)

- the end scene where the woman drives off with the girl and telling her the story of James Bond was a killer to the movie, so well underlined with music but really not fitting the franchise

- I am interested to see where the Bond franchise is heading, but the movie was a major letdown after the daughter appears for the first time

Thanks!",q3nxx2
hgurezr,"This movie was pretty bad. The only good scene i can think of was the  opening scene with the girl and Raimi, which was great. Everything else fell flat. James over the top anger at madeleine came out of nowhere, and it always a bad sign when movies introduce drama like that which could've simply be solved by the characters sitting down for 20 minutes and talking. 

The product placement was just offensive. Yes, it's James Bond, i don't mind the 5 second shots of a watch or other luxury brands being shoe horned into the movie, but the car chases seriously felt like i was forced to watch a commercial. Nothing happened, just never ending shots of cars. 

Finally, i'm sad to say that Daniel Craig gave me ""grandpa wibes"". He looked stiff, his voice sounded old and he seriously lacked charm. At times when he got angry or was trying to make quips he just came of as weird,  bitter old man. Really didn't like that. Almost felt like M was more up for the mission then him.  I think i've been more prone to notice this and get annoyed by it after watching Harrions Ford stumble through action movie after action movie for the last decade. 

Not get into a whole agism thing or anything, i just think his reluctance to pass on the mantle made him overstay his welcome for a movie, or two.The movie felt more like Daniel Craig send off then a James Bond movie. Don't get me started on the ""i'm a big fan"" meta movie or the cheesy death scene, oh my god. 

Craigs last movie should've been Skyfall. Great Bond, probably my favorite as i don't care much for the franchise as a whole, but this movie sucked. Not even good as ""turn your brain off"" popcorn flick.

hfww1ry,"Just finished watching it and I am not just disappointed, I am pissed off. I get that Bond never gets a completely happy ending, especially this Bond, but what kind of bullshit ending is that? Rather than giving him a Jason Bourne ending, they use the Chekhov's gun to make it so he never see the woman he loves and his daughter again, and then (mercy?) kills him off. There also seems to be the implication that perhaps he now was toxic to other people too, making the whole romantic and daughter angle moot. It was bad writing, it was a cop out, and trying to make the audience emotional to cover up the fact that they failed to write a proper ending shows that the writers are hacks.   

Edit: After ruminating on it a bit, maybe pissed off was a bit too strong of a statement. My sentiment still holds though that I think the plot, and especially the ending was poorly written. It was a trite way to give Daniel Craig a unique send-off, as the only Bond to be killed on-screen, and it did so in a poorly conceived fashion.   
Given that the last actor before Craig to have a good third film as Bond was Roger Moore (*The Spy Who Loved Me*, although no offense to his 4th through 7th films), maybe they should limit actors to two films as James Bond.   

&nbsp;   

Note: Timothy Dalton only did two films, Pierce Brosnan's third film was *The World is not Enough*, which charitably is listed as having mixed reviews, and I would say that *Skyfall*, while decent, and necessary to wrap up Judi Dench's career/arc as M, should have been the last Daniel Craig Bond film IMO and could have been a fitting ending for him.",q3nxx2

idk what filter they placed over the apparent 65mm imax cameras, but i couldnt tell what was fake and what was real when i was trying to parse out if they were shooting on location, or a set, or if it's fucking cg at some parts, and i check out visually like that when im unengaged

also, i couldve sworn a couple of the shots were out of focus

easily the best ""cinema"" shot is the placement of the camera in the car, and the shots (gunfire) are placing around the windows and the car, and we see craig act as bond

also, ralph fiennes gives a massive performance with an absolute nothing of a part

why is felix leiter there? who is this logan ash dude? who is rami malek's character again? what was with that whole weird tracking thing to the seydoux character's house again?

why is bond and paloma --- or rather, why are they drinking more (was that jack daniels they were reaching for) right at the end before she leaves? where is the blood for such gratuitous drinking?

and a fuckload of other questions i thought to myself while watching, that i cant reproduce right, but i remember thinking them

im glad they killed him, the CGI stunts are terrible, and is one reason why top gun 2 is going to be massive—tom cruise would never

why does bomb explode in bond's face, and he just waltzes right up! what the fuck

skyfall is easily the best movie, casino royale is probably my favorite along with skyfall, also, why does M have a fade but bond doesnt???? also, i get that the movie star cant be bald, but if ralph fiennes can be bald, then so can craig, and give him a military fade (commander bond?) just like M and whole bunch of other shit",q3nxx2

&#x200B;

Having said that, again, as with most movies, get a better script writer. 

&#x200B;

Even the most basic of plots can be entertaining with a good script, and ofc an actor to carry it. There was nothing wrong with the actors, but imo their script was not that great.

&#x200B;

I feel that the sceen writers are hoping that actors improvise and only use the script as a general reference. Still, doesnt change that I feel this movie could have easily been improved by clearly the casts hard work with a better script and a more engaging plot. 

It felt that they took a more obscure route in story telling and simply wrapped it up at the end before you could call it predicable as a 'tool' in story telling. Kind of like in the witcher Netflix show,in how they had a disconnected time line. 

&#x200B;

Still worth the watch imo, but its not going to be a classic that people will want to watch again unfortunately. Considering the time, hard work, and budget, that is unfortunate that these movies fail to create a more iconic movie.

For example a simple recipe for action movies to be successful, as was seen in Gaurdians of the galaxy with an action comedy, with type casted roles of actors that banter with each other. You see this in many character developed stories as well.

&#x200B;

Again, please call it out these script writers. They are doing everyones hard work a disservice, even if they want actors to go off script they still need to set the over all tone, on when to be serious, and when to be funny, and that still needs good script writers.",q3nxx2
hfxjpb8,"I don't really understand the positive reviews for this film. It was confusing, with way too much navel gazing. The director treats James Bond with reverence, and expects the same from the audience, but I just don't buy it.

Very different films, yes, but obviously the director/writers/producers thought we'd all feel real sad, and I did! But not for much longer than a minute. There will be another Bond, this isn't even close to the end. It's the end of a chapter. 

The plot is convoluted, I couldn't explain it to someone and I saw the film an hour ago. I'd be willing to forgive *all* the above if the movie delivered stunning set pieces or gorgeous cinematography, but this film isn't Skyfall, and it sure as hell isn't Mission Impossible.

hk9gc5t,"If I said that this was the second best Daniel Craig Bond film after Casino Royal, it would probably sound pretty good, but really it has more to do with how weak all his other movies were, especially [Skyfall](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/qb39ws/what_do_you_think_is_the_worst_bond_film/hh9tqk0/), which some people are still trying to convince me was some sort of a masterpiece.

So what did I like about it? I am not too sure myself but I didn't turn it off half way and actually watched the whole thing - which these days counts for something I guess.

Now what I didn't like...

The events of the movie are set into motion when Bond goes to visit the grave of Vesper - and it then blows up right into his face. *Right into his face!* He is completely fine, of course. The baddies simply made the mistake of rigging the grave with only 20kg of high explosives, when it clearly should have been 40kg. What a rookie error! That is to say, there is no need to worry about our hero at all. Bond is virtually untouchable right until the end. Explosions, getting shot at, even being shot, are barely of any consequence to him. It's very much reminiscent of the action in movies like John Wick or Extraction where the main hero goes through literal hordes of aim challenged enemies without any fear, tension or emotional engagement - on the part of the character *or the audience*. But hey, that's something people seemingly can't get enough of, so there we go.

I do appreciate that there is a bit more levity and that the character of Bond is less of a miserable, disinterested dullard just going through the motions - as if being the world's greatest spy, saving the world and banging hot women was the biggest drag imaginable -, especially since all the bizarre and physics defying stunts and gadgets and the wholly unrealistic portrayals of people, institutions and the world at large would be pretty hard to square up with the movie having a serious tone, but it definitely doesn't work as a seamless whole. 

Right at the start we get Bond and Madeleine discussing their relationship and the dialogue is like if a pair of awkward teenagers were talking. At that point I already don't really buy the relationship or how Bond seemingly fits into it - which is just as well because moments later we get an angry, cold as ice Bond who is not quite sure if he should save Madeleine or let her die. See, I would think it extremely unlikely someone who loves you and who you are supposed to be in love with could betray you on such a deep level and you wouldn't be able to tell beforehand or afterwards. Don't buy that at all. So this whole relationship that serves as such a big motivation for Bond going forward, falls completely flat in the first 10 minutes. This, however, goes completely unnoticed by the film itself which merrily trots forward as if every character's motivations were rock solid, and that comes to a head in the latter parts of the movie when we are supposed to be getting a big emotional pay off - now rendered incomprehensible and impotent by the weak setup. 

And really, even aside from all that, who the hell is Bond in this movie? It seems to me that lately - well, in the last 25 years at least - there has been a real problem with trying to nail Bond as the man's man, the alpha male, the man every man wants to be and every woman wants to fuck. Bond is supposed to be the ultimate expression of a male fantasy and it seems like nobody is really sure these days what that is and how such a man would look like. It's certainly not what we've been getting, though. It's either been someone who takes about as much joy and interest in what he is doing or even his own survival as a depressed plank of wood, or - like in this movie - we get a wild contrast between that and this other Bond that's been through emotional sensitivity training or something and wants to start a family. There are certainly no women getting charmed - god forbid seduced - during the course of the movie. The only possible instance ends up, again, awkwardly, as the woman rebuffs him and laughs. To be fair, though, in today's climate it would be quite shocking just if there was someone who *would know* how to write a traditionally masculine character - not to mention there being the will to actually go forward with it. It's something of a minor miracle that Bond only ended up getting killed and not castrated, to be honest.

What ends up happening, how the world events, institutions and technology are treated isn't really all that different from previous Bond movies, I guess, but it does seem a little quaint these days for sure. The MI6 technology department being run by a single 20 year old, magical nano-bots, cars with miniguns under the headlights, there being vast, super secret, super villain groups vying for world domination with spies in every government organization and leaders that are able to orchestrate complicated multi-step events from behind the bars with the help of some magical gizmo - it doesn't really work. Maybe it did before everyone had the capability to be a cameraman, before everyone could be a reporter by just accessing twitter, before we had access to all the world's knowledge at all times and before we could look up an easily digestible 10 min video on any topic. It's really the same criticism, I think, there was when the Bourne movies came out. Bourne is the Bond version for the modern world - and Bond these days is more like a cute fairy-tale. 

Last thing I would touch on - which sort of ties into Bond not fitting today's world - the villain doesn't really fit either. None of the recent ones do. What was his goal exactly? And why? Why does he die for literally no reason at the end making it seem like there was no point him even doing anything he did? And how exactly does he get to be the leader of this mysterious new villain group and own an island as if it was the lair under the volcano? I don't really know any villains like that in the real world - but then neither do I know any secret service agents like Bond.",q3nxx2

Felt like they were mocking the Bond fanbase with the Ash character. Also why would Bond save him after all that?

hgh4qhe,"This is what I found interesting, a plot leak from like January:

>James Bond and Madeline Swann are attacked by SPECTRE during their honeymoon in Italy. Bond thinks Madeline betrayed him and leaves her.

>Five years later, Bond is recruited by Felix Leiter and his partner Logan Ash (Billy Magnussen) to help the CIA rescue a scientist from SPECTRE in Cuba.

>Bond meets MI6 agent Nomi (Lashana Lynch), who replaced him as 007.

>Bond and CIA agent Paloma (Ana de Armas), Felix's protege, rescue the scientist from a SPECTRE gathering.

>Ash betrays them, kills Felix and Paloma and attempts to leave with the scientist, but Nomi rescues him.

>Bond rejoins the MI6 to avenge Felix and Paloma and learns that Madeline is working for them, and that they have a daughter, Mathilde.

>Bond interrogates Blofeld, who reveals that SPECTRE’s new leader Safin (Rami Malek) is obsessed with
Madeline and wants to use a bioweapon made by the scientist to wipe out the human race.

>Ash kidnaps Madeline and Mathilde and take them to Safin's lair on a private island so they will survive his purge.

>Blofeld helps them find the island. Bond and Nomi join forces to infiltrate it in the stealth plane.

>Safin killed Madeleine's mother when she was a child in a failed attempt to kill her father, Mr. White, and young Madeleine shot him.

>Safin saved young Madeleine after she fell into a frozen lake trying to escape and has been obsessed with her ever since.

>Safin has used genetic engineering to maintain his youth, and now plans to use it to reshape humanity to his image.

>Bond disables the bioweapon and kills Safin while Nomi kills Ash and rescues Madeline and Mathilde.

>The four escape as Safin’s lair explodes, and Bond retires to be with his family while Nomi returns to the MI6 as the new 007.

Interestingly it gives a bit of explanation for how Safin looks young (which I found interesting) and some motivation (even if it's weak). I'm fairly sure this may have been an earlier cut of the film or something. It's too accurate. Interesting that they didn't plan to kill Bond at that point.",q3nxx2
hg17h40,"Yeah, same for me on all counts. I feel like if they’d known from the get go what they wanted to accomplish across 5 films, this Big Bad at the end could have been Christoph Waltz’s character instead.

That’s really my only knock here though, I loved everything else about this film. So I’ve got it behind Casino Royale and Skyfall.",q3nxx2
hg75ckw,Did the movie ever specify who all he wanted to kill? And did the movie even imply who his approaching customers in the two unmarked boats might be?

hg14htv,Same on the villain. The motivation make sense if you have something bigger than him behind the scenes. Now Bond just died stopping a mid-level villain,q3nxx2
hfvjnn7,"For me the, the weak points were:

- Malek's motivation didn't make any sense and wasn't clarified
- plot holes around Bond immediately thinking his wife betrayed him when there were obvious other explanations
- Lashana Lynch was completely outclassed by Naomi Harris and over acted everything

hfvci3u,"That was me. So when the production company said ""Postponed due to Covid"" they actually meant it. The whole film centers around a lab-created bioweapon with the ability to ""wipe out millions."" Ha!",q3nxx2

hgbex26,I really liked the movie overall until the ending at the island.  I felt the plot throughout was good and always had me thinking.  I loved the Bond and Madelline relationship.  I thought the pacing was good.  The ending just felt like it came down to some cliches of this type of movie and doing things conveniently to put things in the places they need to be.,q3nxx2
hgha79e,I agree with the pacing. Not only do they go from set piece to set piece they travel to a different country each time to do it. It's like they feel they have to jet around the world as it's a Bond film but they can keep things tighter and more fluid by keeping locations together. He travels from London to Norway so they can have an action scene in a forest. Then after they have to put in a scene of him getting picked up by the new 007. Then they have a conversation about getting on a plane. Then they're on a plane travelling to an island near Japan. These all add up and about 15 minutes of the run time is just the logistics of him travelling around the world.,q3nxx2
hke27hk,"I know I'm late to the party, just finished watching it and wanted to find this thread, but I completely agree with your analysis.

hg21xgn,I thought the same thing. It even had a dramatic ladder climb. What thrill...,q3nxx2
hg2n80e,"We’ve come full circle. Really though there seemed like quite a few parallels. Bond coming out of retirement, Foxdie, Q giving them (presumably) nanomachines to monitor their status, that drone Bond and new 007 flew to the island was reminiscent of the 2nd infiltration in MGS3, and then it turned into a sub like the intro of MGS1, and then Bond basically becoming a one man army and taking down a full base by himself by the skin of his teeth. It was badass.",q3nxx2

* Long ladder for emotional scene

It also reminded me of ""The Rock""

* aging James Bond

Still not something that's made clear at all, but that was my impression.",q3nxx2
hfuga0h,Agreed. I think Safin was the weakest part of the film.,q3nxx2
hfw6gzm,"I think he explains it during his talk with Madeleine in her office, when he says how saving a life had as much impact as taking one, even though it was his fault she was in a position to be saved. And saving her was his reasoning for why he should be able to control her. Not killing off everyone was his way of saving them, even though he's killing everyone else, thus he should be able to control them.",q3nxx2

Safin: I'm only targeting the worst people in the world. The politicians, the tech titans, and the worst criminals.

Bond: But what about their families? 

Safin: Collateral damage cannot be avoided. Weeds must be pulled if you wish your garden to be beautiful. 

Or just something like that. His motivation was really unclear.",q3nxx2
hfyoqjw,"And it would have totally made sense and probably completed his character if he started to target the worlds most powerful people who were complacent in the system that got his family killed.  A next logical step in his villainy.

But... something tells me they had to change that.  He was probably a slightly heavier element about not trusting the powers that be and resetting the power structures of the world, which would have made Ms decision much more nuanced and could even, I don’t know, have something smart around like covering it up as a normal pandemic that just happened to get all our leaders, while bond finally only starts fighting just to protect the ones he loves.... 

but the pandemic happened.  

And a man siccing a deadly virus as a means to take out the people that lead society while in real life society is being held by those very people with scotch tape in scissors due to disinformation.... I think they might have changed it.  

It’s hinted at a lot as a thing they were going to do and the only indication that we see in the entire thing it’s a random pandemic that exists for no reason other than “AH!  SCARY!”  No way a movie this smart would just have a villain with genuine depth do something so fucking pointless.  Unless they had to alter it using the footage they had available to them.  

Then it would come out as something like what we got.  I loved it and understand why it might not be exactly what we were going to originally get.",q3nxx2
hg5uyeh,Safin's plan was to mumble at the protagonists enough that they got confused and annoyed and left.,q3nxx2
hfy8h52,"Yeah, this is a really good assessment, but I allowed it because Rami Malek’s performance was pretty good and the speeches were good as well. It kind sucks that they didn’t have another “big bad” above blofeld, but it makes sense if they havent been building towards that for what 16 years? Better than what they did with “The Rise of Skywalker”",q3nxx2

hfxu6lj,"I didn’t follow this part either, I need to watch it again to see. The nanobots are targeted at the start but then later on they show that video of the nanobots spreading and it seemed like it wasn’t targeted? But I didn’t pick up on why he wants to release an untargeted nanobot virus. What’s going to stop it from killing everyone? The only other potential thing I picked up on was the evil scientist saying he could design it to kill all black people. So maybe they were going to target some specific population. But even then I didn’t pick up on why.",q3nxx2

I am also *so damn bored* of the whole ""we're just two sides of the same coin, you and I"" speech that endless villains are constantly giving in films in the past few years: it's becoming almost as cliche as the ""blue light in the sky"" trope that for a while was in everything too.",q3nxx2
hlz19s0,I agree. I thought he was a good guy up to that point.,q3nxx2
hk5vts9,"I genuinely enjoyed not knowing his full evil plan. I feel one of the weaker parts of Skyfall and Spectre (both of which I really like) as well as Quantum were the very complicated plans, goals, and motivations of the villain. 

I think this film acknowledges that and even punishes Specter for that complexity addiction. 

Safin felt so much more pragmatic. He still has the base and is an insane man. But we never know exactly where he's headed.",q3nxx2

Honestly, I liked this movie more than Skyfall. I loved Skyfall the first time I watched it, but then it didn't hold up on rewatches as well for me because I came to realize just how much it rips off The Dark Knight.

Sprawling epic sequel to gritty grounded reboot of a long running franchise, with an espionage scene in a Chinese skyscraper building, and a crazy agent of chaos villain blowing up bombs in the hero's home city. And that villain also dresses up as a cop at one point to attempt assassination on elder colleague/parental figure of the protagonist.

Are they going to kill Swann and their daughter, like Tracy in *OHMSS*?""

No.  It may have been obvious in retrospect, but I just didn't think Bond would let himself be killed once he realized he could never be with his family.  It absolutely works, but it was still heartbreaking.",q3nxx2

I thought the same as you with the watch, and the watch wouldn’t have had any impact at all if the nanobots were originally written as a bio weapon. 

Other people in this thread are also speculating that a lot of the Safin’s motivations likely got cut for the same reasons. 

Really too bad, I feel like most James Bond fans would have been able to overlook any real-world covid comparisons. I think the retrofit offers a good explanation for some of the weaker points in the film. For me, this film was near perfect otherwise, and I have a hunch that if they’d left it as originally written, it probably would have hit all the marks.",q3nxx2
hfuz923,"It's almost like they specifically set it up to do just that only to forget about it. ""Here's a watch. I don't know exactly how strong it is or what all it can do as we haven't had time to test it yet. Be careful"" 

It could have been similar to MI3 where Ethan Hunt has to die to kill the explosive in his head only to be brought back to life.",q3nxx2
hfybtpn,Nano bots don’t have batteries. (Like where would you put them? They’re the size of blood cells) they use electrolytes to do stuff. The IMDb goof on this one was wrong. But agree with how it didn’t break his earpiece,q3nxx2
hfurn6s,"Yah, that's how they stopped the nanovirus in Stargate Atlantis, just blew a nuke up in orbit over the island and it would knock all the machines out",q3nxx2

I guess they must've rejigged it to be nanobots instead of a virus after Covid. They came from a biolab where they were talking about ebola and they never mention them being nanobots again in the entire movie.",q3nxx2
hfxwf49,"I feel like they MUST have cut out an explanation for why the EMP couldn't stop the nanomachines. It can't have only had two charges, conveniently.

Even a tiny line explaining or even just SAYING that it wouldn't work would have been fine.",q3nxx2
hftstcu,It did go a bit Kingsman for a sec.,q3nxx2
hg0l7w7,"Ummm..
Yeah now that you mention it that seems like a major plot hole. If they are nano machines you could disable them with a electric pulse or an EMP. 

So basically Bond died for no reason",q3nxx2
hg2ar6l,"That was one of the first things I thought of. It seemed like a Chekov's gun scenario. It would have made much more sense in my head, if the virus was a biological virus, as the introduction of nano-tech made it seem much more defeatable, especially with the watch being the main Bond-gadget for the film.",q3nxx2
hkl3lj1,"Saw this comment elsewhere: “ “Nanomites are actually a real thing, and they're entirely organic. They're ""programmed"" using dna,  like in the movie, therefore they're technically bio material, not actual microscopic robots, therefore they would be unaffected by emp, plus wouldn't have a kill switch. Of course, they could have possibly created a countermeasure, possibly another set of nanomites to destroy the dangerous nanobites”",q3nxx2
hfx7pbe,"Oh my god you're right! I forgot about that watch. I  got quite bored with the whole poison garden fights, I didn't really pay attention to the movie.

To be fair, her scene was the *only* one show in trailers. She looked amazing, but when the only thing shown of her in any trailer is in a slinky cocktail dress, it's implied that she won't be in it for long.

Still, it did feel very video-gamey. Fight with Bond for 10 minutes then say ""We'll do this again!"" then close the door and move on to the next cutscene.",q3nxx2

I am convinced that the nanobots are a change that was made for after covid. That the original macguffin was some sort of genetic pathogen - the whole lab was setup like it was something they grow and harvest not manufacture. And why is the secret lab in the beginning dealing with strains of smallpox and ebola if its for manufacturing a weaponized nanobot?

Even if we say Safin was only 10 years older than Madeline (which is REALLY pushing it), that still puts Blofeld giving the order to White (and thus being in charge of Spectre) in the 80s, or 40 years ago.  So either Blofeld was the world's most persuasive teenager in assembling an international conspiracy group at an age when Americans are more worried about college applications, or he and Bond look damn good for their 60s-70s/50s-60s respectively",q3nxx2

Beautiful way of putting it!

That being said, a few scenes seemed overly telegraphed, which felt really bizarre for such an adult movie.

All it took was Rami smashing the vial on Bond's face and many people in my theater (myself included) audibly gasped. But then for the next 5 minutes I felt like Kronk was explaining it to the audience...

Over the years he built up his revenge plan against Spectre. When he finally stole the nanobot poison tech, he was planning on using that power to do a generic “take over the world plan.” But he’s doing that by programming the nanobots en-masse tailored toward different organizations, different ethnicities, etc. and selling them off as a weapon to various terrorist buyers. In the meantime he’s found Madeline and wants her to be his wife-slave on the island, and threatened her daughter’s life if she didn’t help kill Blofeld. 

That’s as much of a plan/motivation as a Bond villain needs IMO. It’s delivered in pieces but you have to put the pieces together yourself. But I totally get people wanting more explanation, or not feeling satisfied. It can feel a little muddled but made more sense on a second viewing.",q3nxx2

Really? I thought she was massively disappointing. She didn't feel like a character in a Bond movie *at all*. I thought Ana De Ames was far, far better if you wanted to spin off.

Ames sold herself as a female spy far better than Lynch, Lynch seemed like a soldier, maybe a good one but in no way a spy.

I was bored by the look and feel of that entire sequence. And unfortunately for the movie, that even made Bond's death fall flat. I was shocked that he died and I didnt feel too bad about it. I also think that has to do with the fact that they did not really show us a lot of Bond and his woman loving each other, and thus when he died for her, it fell flat.

This is where the whole strong canon element of Craig's Bond plays a role. You can't just ignore Madeline or Spectre.

I was down for him brutally wiping out Spectre. 

What they SHOULD HAVE done imo is, in his own twisted mind, think that MI6, and the CIA, and all these government organizations are just as bad as Spectre. And that he should have been targeting all known members of those agencies. That would have made it immediately better for me. 

Literally the only reasoning he would have needed, and it would have been valid for me, would be a line like Safin saying to Bond: ""How many fathers, sons, brothers have you and your MI6 killed?"", or some shit like that. I think that easily would have worked.",q3nxx2

A biological weapon also fits better with the whole ""poison garden"" thing, you'd think nanobots wouldn't need thousands of workers in hazmat suits brewing something in the water, you'd just directly program them with the DNA you want.

Bond realizes this and then spends his final moments ensuring that no one will be affected by this technology ever.

1. He didnt order ash to kill felix and blow the ship up. Ash did that because the scientist was about to tell bond about everything and he was even looking at Ash. Ash his cover was blown and felix attacked him. Ash was defending himself thats why he killed felix, and he blew up the ship because he locked bond in the deck below and thought it would kill him.
2. He kidnapped madeleine because he loves her. After finishing off Spectre he wanted to be with Madeleine.
3. He didn't care about what the weapon did. With Spectre gone he most likely just wanted to be the next big criminal organization. He was planning on selling the weapon. But this one is just a theory
4. I didnt understand this one either lol

So most of the infrastructure (at least the gardens and poison) existed for a long time, built by Safin’s parents and ancestors and financed by Spectre.

After all the buildup the link between him and Mathilde ses underwhelming : how was that a big secret she had to hide from Bond ? Even  what he tries to achieve remains unclear : why even bother to capture Bond family when it guaranteed he would go look after them and then let go the daughter just because she bit him   ? The villain  wants to eliminate evil/make the world a better place ? But then why does he want to sell the weapon to private buyers ? I know the guy isn’t totally sane in the head but even insanity can have a logic and I hardly feel any here.

Norway where she was following the guy who is headed right for Bond to try to get rid of him by...driving next to him for a bit? She is nowhere to be found even though *we just literally heard that she's following the guy!* Just turns up after to give Bond a ride, which he didn't even need because the SUV he drove into the woods with should still be sitting there in perfect working order. Plus there is at least one dirt bike that should be working fine.

How about Cuba? She basically escapes the fight and then...stands behind a pillar for a few minutes? She's a 00 agent and she can't get away?? And then lets the scientist get taken from her? I think they just didn't want Bond to have to babysit the scientist in that scene so the focus could remain on him and de Armas so they just had her be useless.

The attack on the secret base? She flies him the last bit (which he could easily do himself), shoots some totally incompetent generic bad guys, kills the scientist then takes away his baby mama and kid to go sit on a rock. Literally anyone could do that. The baby mama herself could handle it, I'm quite certain. Or don't kill Felix earlier and have him be with Bond during the island attack.

He then came back decades later with a new plan - Kill Spectre, which he did then checked out of the story again. THEN he came back with a newer plan - Kidnap Madeline and her daughter for some unknown reason turning up with a fleet of mercenaries like he was expecting resistance even though she'd been there alone ages and all her allies don't know her location or are wiped out. Let's not ask why, maybe he got lonely.

Ostensibly this was collateral to get Bond to leave the island but the only reason he was there in the first place was because Safin brought Madeline there and if anyone else was sent she was pointless. Then he pivoted again at the first sign of trouble, let her and the daughter go and came up with a new new new plan - Destroy half the world, which he then apparently pivoted from AGAIN offscreen to selling the damn things then pivoted back to staying on death posion island to die just so he could poison Bond after shooting him point blank with a machine pistol rather than just y'know, taking the sample of bots he had and leaving after shooting Bond in the first place and using those to wipe out humanity or Madeline or Bond or whoever regardless of the missiles since they infinitely spread and can't be removed.

He died because he couldn't be arsed with exponential spread and kept changing his direction like a moth at Diwali. All he had to do was leave the island or send the bots with someone who could or even put them inside Madeline's daughter and kill everyone you want or just not take Madeline and achieve it since he was 20 minutes away from shipping/selling the bots even with invoking the wrath of Bond/Mi6. I think he was just ADHD.

Poisoning him so he couldn't see Madeline again fit Bloefeld's motives but just shooting him dead fit Safin's (which he did, then suddenly was possessed by the spirit of Bloefld) ... it feels like the characters were once one and then split at some point.

hgyi63s,I get what you're saying but M desired Heracles to be the perfect tool to take out its designated target. Its even mentioned that the nanobots can travel through person to person until it reaches the intended victim. It wasn't meant to be a mass extinction weapon so having a cure or way to eradicate the bots from someone wasn't really a consideration.,q3nxx2

hkmsr1j,"Spoilers: 
>!We start with the movie with an incredible flashback lacking any context, until the following scene where we learn it is a defining, character shaping experience in Madeleine Swann’s childhood. Bond and Madeleine have a warm romance, it finally feels as Bond can move on from the loss of Vesper and embrace this new romance. This is subsequently shattered in a heart-pounding action sequence following the explosion of Vesper’s final resting place, we’re left wondering and on edge as Bond races to retrieve Madeleine, with all of us wondering if this is just another sword placed through Bond’s already weathered heart, which was just shy of being healed. The sequence that follows with Bond’s evasion of encroaching agents of Spectre coupled with his new mistrust of Madeleine culminating in an incredible, intriguing scene as Bond’s car is receiving gunfire just shy of penetrating the glass, Bond taking no action, only to finally pull a typical (in a good way) Bond-styled escape. We see him place Madeleine on the train, it’s heart breaking as Madeleine continues to race along the train to get a final glimpse of her love, Bond. The scene is heartbreaking, just as Bond was finally to have closure & a new love, it is stolen from him again, his greatest wound being his already wounded heart from Vesper’s death & betrayal. After this, we see the assault on the bioweapon lab by Spectre agents, conducted in a very futuristic manner reminiscent of the Dark Knight Rises. We see there is further conflicts of interest and doubt, regarding the true loyalties of the Russian scientist & M himself. This is further expounded on in the next sequence: We now find ourselves in Jamaica, this proceeds orderly, we’re introduced new characters and reintroduced to those of past such as Felix. We see that the CIA and MI6 are in conflict, not working in tandem, in the pursuit of the Russian scientist and Heracles. After this, we find Bond in Cuba — which may have been one of the best sequences in the movie. Bond teams up with a much younger Paloma, breaches the Spectre gathering, and when the spotlight literally shines on Bond, with Blofeld seemingly remotely monitoring & commenting on the action at hand in real time despite his incarceration. This is one of the first moments where we almost achieve perfection, but it misfires. The suspense of that scene just does not land for as surprising as it should be. Redeeming it to an extent, we see Bond & Paloma fight their way out in perfect unison as though they were dancing a Tango, or perhaps a Salsa due to the location. Bond recovers the scientist, delivers him to Felix, and subsequently we see the betrayal by the state department agent whose loyalties remain unknown. We witness Felix’s death, a should-be moving event, the death of a long time recurring character, we see an attempt made at eliciting this emotion with Bond’s struggle to save him, but it falls flat — an undeserving execution for such an iconic character, whose death occurs as though he were a one-movie side character. Everything following this just continues to fall short in magnitude of impact. Bond’s encounter with Madeleine, Bond’s final interaction with Blofeld, Bond’s reunion with Madeleine & realization she has a child which, despite what she says, we all know is Bond’s daughter. The sequence following does not fall short, and we see a mesmerizing scene of Bond’s escape with Madeleine and his daughter from Spectre agents, his vicious neutralizing of their overwhelming numbers in the eerie mist, to of course, expectedly, see Madeleine & daughter abducted. Everything following this increasingly falls flat despite the would-be increasing intensity. The villains compound in a fitting part of the world, it’s design, the villains ambitions & Bond’s compromised capability by the villains possession of his daughter. Rami Malek, an incredible actor, had his talents disappointingly underutilized for the villain he is intended to be. The intensity builds, multiple countries are questioning activities on the island as Bond races against the clock to both secure his families safety & stop the impending armageddon. Bond calls in for the Royal Navy to launch its missiles on the island. Every moment should have your heart racing, but it doesn’t. Eventually, we find Bond is mortally wounded, and seemingly permanently infected with a poison that will never allow him to have physical contact with his family again. As other commenters have pointed out, the scientific background for this poison’s mechanism simply does not add up. Although it is portrayed as though Bond is doomed, he really  wasn’t and didn’t need to be. The film very well could have allowed for his mysterious escape, cure, and reunion with family. Instead, we have him speaking with Madeleine in his final moments before the missiles extinguish his life that otherwise persevered through much greater trials. It appears Bond had given up, atypical of him. Furthermore, his final interaction with Madeleine just simply isn’t emotionally provoking, perhaps due to the actors’ fatigue. He perishes in an avoidable manner, Bond receives a solemn, still unemotionally provocative, quasi-funeral in the HQ of MI6. We end with Madeleine and her/Bond’s daughter driving along as she tells her daughter a ‘story about a man named James Bond’. It is so anti-climatic in its ending, so unfitting, it not only dishonors the movie but the legacy of the films preceding.  We would hope to see a conclusion such as in the Dark Knight Rises, where Alfred returns to the same spot in Italy, and sees Bruce, who escaped his presumed peril, living his life & romance with the woman he loves. Instead, we are left with nothing. Not Bond making a glimmer of appearance & reunion with Madeleine to finally live his life free of enemies, complete, and having the love & life he deserved. Instead, the ending leaves you with what Rami Malek’s character wished to impose on the world: oblivion. It is a tragic, unfulfilling, upsetting ending without closure to an incredible chronicle of films comprising the Craig-Bond era. Not only the film is soiled, but the incredible preceding films are left feeling pointless as well. I could not imagine a less fulfilling, devastating, conclusion to this series of movies. My general sentiment was that this was the first movie I’ve seen where I entered with something, was not given anything, but just had more robbed from me — I really don’t think I’ve seen a film not just fail to deliver, but take something away. If oblivion was what was meant to achieve, the movie succeeds, as you’re left feeling empty!<",q3nxx2

hgyc89o,Q mentioned they didn't know the range. Turns out the range was really fucking shitty haha,q3nxx2
hip6qwc,"as you probably know, ""Casino Royale"" was the first James Bond novel by Ian Fleming, and (in the novel) the demise of the Bond/Vesper relationship is what compels Bond to remain in MI6 and hunt down the villains who caused all of this to happen. the ending of the film *Casino Royale* changes the way Vesper dies but otherwise stays fairly faithful to the novel's ending.

so I would argue the purpose of the Bond/Vesper relationship was not to give the movie a romantic interlude, it was to get the story to a place where Bond cares about a person so much that that person's betrayal would hurt Bond terribly.

with Madeleine it's a little different, I think we're meant to think that there's at least several weeks (or possibly several months) in between the end of *Spectre* when they drive off in the Aston Martin DB5 to when we find them in the beginning of NTTD in Matera. it's a little sad Bond didn't know his daughter for very long but he did seem to have love with Madeleine for quite some time (even if it was depicted off screen).",q3nxx2

I honestly don't even know why he wanted Blofeld dead, but I haven't seen Spectre since it first released so my memory of the story threads through these two is hazy at best. If it was explained in this one why he was targeting Blofeld, then I missed it entirely. 

I did overall really enjoy the movie but Safin does drag it down. One of the least memorable villains of Craig's run, which is a shame since Rami Malek is an incredible talent.",q3nxx2
hgf7vzb,">I still don't fully understand what his plan was or why he was still wanting to use the bio-weapon on the world.

I actually think that was intentional.  It's a Bond Movie Cliche to have the villain fully explain his plans to Bond so the writers subverted it this time.  My guess was Safin wanted to pull something like Drax in Moonraker, i.e. restart humanity but on a smaller scale.  Notice he seems to be targeting North America and Europe which would imply he wants to wipe out the rich nations of the world.",q3nxx2
hgdy9ms,"I might think of the villain along the lines of Death Note's Kira, except you need the DNA rather than just the name.  He doesn't have to use the weapon for genocide, he could just aim it at the targets he thinks deserve it.  And their families too, but he doesn't really care about that.

The movie wasn't really great at explaining his motivation.  I can only really bring up what it felt like to me.",q3nxx2
hgexhfd,"> Safin ruins the movie- he mumbles so much that you can't understand what he's saying half the time, and after he accomplishes his plan of killing Spectre/Blofeld his motivations make no sense. I still don't fully understand what his plan was or why he was still wanting to use the bio-weapon on the world.
> 
> 

I went to the washroom and came back and he seemed to be done explaining it to Madeleine after he took her and her daughter (who really should have had little value to him at that point)

hkl09mv,Well technically they mentioned that Maleks characters family were the Poison family of Spectre. Spectre decided to kill them all and somehow the son survived (but deformed). So in a way Malek’s character is also a remnant part of Spectre that has gone onto be a vengeful man,q3nxx2

It was so weird when in the end he was carrying Mathilde around, and you think she's his leverage against Bond, but then she just bites him, and he's like, ""Whatever, go back to your mom, I don't care about you"".

Ana de Armas (who was the highlight of the entire thing) was only in the film because Craig fell in love with her (as one should) in *Knives Out*, so they inserted her in the movie as sort of a glorified cameo. The whole Cuba subplot didn't have much reason to exist, Spectre could be killed off anywhere. And since when does Bond need a guide when he visits a location, especially one where he's already been? And what exactly did she assist him with? It was completely a showcase for De Armas, but thank god for that.",q3nxx2
hlvdy5a,"That killing henchman thing has been popularized by John Wick for sure...for better or worse

hr0nut6,">They never explained how Waltz was able to run things while in a high security maximum prison

Overall, I agree with most of your points. But they did explain this. Blofeld had a bionic eye which helped him stay in contact, while his captors thought he was just babbling to himself in his cell. It's not a very good explanation though.",q3nxx2
hqsdlax,"Wow. I just watched this movie tonight and you literally captured all of my thoughts. Though you seem to be a bit higher on the movie than I was. 

I think the fact that Malek's motivations were murky / not fleshed out was a huge issue with the second half of the movie. I literally paused it just to stop and think, wait, why is he taking Madeleine? What the fuck does he care? And then everything in his ""lair"" seemed to make no sense. 

But totally agree on your other points. I think the action just wasn't as stylish as Skyfall with a lot of great colors and set pieces.

Best sequence of the film imo. Gd she is so fine.

>- Some of the gunplay was unrealistic. There were times where Lynch and Armas both shot machine guns with one hand. Kinda hard to believe that CIA/MI6 operators would handle weapons like that. Same thing with shooting pistols one-handed. Anyone with firearms training will shoot with both hands unless the situation dictates they cant, which is very very rare

hg6dd7d,"Yes the mosquito scene baffled me, that’s why I came to this! The thread above mentioned that the villain felt out of place because he’s a botanist with poison plants and then uses nanobots and that the original plan had been something like a virus. I kept thinking about what mosquitos could symbolize; mosquitos are pesky and annoying and they transmit disease. I thought that maybe the daughter had gotten the nanobot then and if bond became attached to her and touched her it would kill him. Perhaps maybe that was intended to be the original plan because it was weird how they went from you’re not the father to just accepting that he was the father? Maybe he wasn’t supposed to know in the original cut and they did away with it? If anyone has any ideas I’d love to hear what you think.

Ps: I would've loved to have seen bond give the 007 to the other 007, he didn’t so maybe that’s still coming. Just something to solidify her as the new 007 but the last time she is associated with it she’s giving it back to him so maybe it won’t be her? I also didn’t like how they could’ve killed Bond at any time with the chemical weapon and just chose not to, the weapon was too overpowered in my opinion for him to fight. Lastly, I’m wondering what they guy with the eye symbolized because he kept popping up, especially at the end when bond killed like 100 soldiers instantly and then the eye guy is the only one he struggles with only to fry his brain. Is it some sort of strife between Madeline and bond? Maybe specter?

Loved the reference or reminder of the CR stairwell fight.

At the island when he’s talking to Bond he gleefully revels in the fact that the world population doesn’t yet know he’s in control of their lives, but that he’s their god, burrowing under their skin (via Herakles), and about to be deciding whether they live or die. 

Those are his exact words about what he’s trying to achieve metaphorically, but his literal plans for the virus (beyond just having control once it infects everyone) are more vague, and you could rightfully criticize that. He planned to either use the virus to achieve his own means or sell it / share it with people who would use it to achieve other horrible results - doesn’t even matter exactly why, but even just the potential for it to be used catastrophically (to wipe out whole ethnicities, etc like Q was saying) was enough reason to need to destroy it and stop it from being discovered by the rest of the world. In the conversation with Bond and M on the riverside, M asks Bond what Safin wants to do with the weapon now that Spectre is gone and Bond just kinda sums it all up as “oh, well you know, the usual” - he says it could be global mass death, overthrowing democracy and law & order, “all this” as he gestures all around them.

I agree with your take, as I think that's all that was needed for this Bond film, but I do think that it would have been a better film if we knew more about him/had more scenes with him.

Now all that said I wouldn't change it because the focus is 100% on Bond and not on the villain. Focusing more on Safin would be better if it was a 100% stand alone film, but it isn't so any more focus on Safin would take away focus from Bond and change the nature of the film.",q3nxx2

I had so much expectations in the opening scenes, it had me smiling and made me glad that Craig will end his part  on a high note. He was a fantastic Bond. Wasn't comically handsome and smirking all the time. Was rough and cold and mysterious. But they disrespected that with poor writing, other than Casino of course (also in my top 10 films of all time)

There's so much they could have done with Malek saving Madeline only for him to ask for a small favor to help kill the villain in a prison cell from the last movie? Uh okay I guess, that's one way of reconnecting Bond and Madeline.

And how could they not make Bond die for his country? I was thinking when the island gates were being shut  that Bond would have to be physically present at all times to keep them open or something (thought they closed automatically).
 
The least they could do is not crank the run time up with endless waves of incompetent storm troopers. What a let down. I'm really hoping one day they will be able to top Casino.",q3nxx2

hm03bf5,"You make some very good points with M and the stairway scene. My argument for why it was important for 007 to kill that scientist over that comment - he can make a nanovirus that can hone in on DNA and he was threatening her with genocide. Yes you can be a patriot and identify strongly as an Englishman but as a black person, you’re faced with danger that are unique to black people. Something to consider!  
  
Bond has faced tragedy since the first film. He’s an orphan who was betrayed by a woman he deeply loved in a complicated situation. He finally has someone who he can truly trust (big struggle for his character) AND he has a daughter. He can have a family for the first time in his life. Unfortunately he gets infected with a poison that can kill them. What does he have to live for at this point? Much more interesting ending than merely “saving the world”",q3nxx2
hlz0gou,"I agree with everything. The first half felt like a Bond movie and even more as Bond sailed from JAIMAICA to CUBA. As soon as the movie makes it into the Royal Navy Destroyer it declines suddenly. Killing Wright immediately foreshowed the ending for me and brought me into the assumption of an ""Oh gosh, I'm being reminded that they are going to reboot the franchise,"" while I was watching the film for the first time at a drive-in theatre. After that, it was hard to stay entertained until the foggy massacre by Bond (which was so fantastic) but I started to get bored during the facility invasion in the final 30 minutes. 

Honestly, it would've made more sense for either Bond to find a way into the water or MI6 could simply call off the strikes since the threats were pretty much neutralized. However, I think that Bond either (1) Knew he was going to die from his wounds or (2) Didn't want Daddy duties. 

It just seemed silly with the ""oh this completely super secret nanomachine weapon that just was exposed a few days ago has no cure"" seems a bit far-fetched, no fail safe system was implemented in case of this exact scenario?  

Ideally, Bond could've been quarantined and exiled himself back to Jamaica where he could live the life on his retirement pension.

How do you destroy a nanobot? Electricity would be ineffective, electrons flow along the path of least resistance. But nanobots are the size of viruses, there is a minuscule probability that the current would pass exactly through them. Even if it did, there might not be enough potential difference to affect the nanobots. EMPs dont work neither, nanobots can be made from carbon or non-magnetic materials. These things aren't exactly robots but smaller.  
All organic things are made from carbon, scanning for it would be pointless. Q must have a great lab to be able to detect them in the blood samples at all.  
In fact the movie keeps repeating that you cannot destroy them. The best they could do was destroy the facility so the nanobots would stuck in the water with no way for anyone to collect, program or distribute them.  
If you understood anything about them you would understand why Bond says there will be nothing left to protect if they dont launch the missiles immediately.  
Bond is an orphan who grew up to be a killer eliminating people because an agency tells him that it will benefit the world.

No, but it was much more interesting to see those interactions instead of just seeing Bond with yet another generic character like sadly Rami Malek's character was. Likewise the situation with him and new 007 was more interesting to watch because the ""archetype"" of boss lady and strong black woman is different and brings a diffrent dynamic. I think if you don't go in with the mentality that ""this is a diversity Hollywood move"", the casting and character doesn't take anything away from your viewing experience. I would go as far as comparing this to Amanda Waller from DC. Does she have to be a strong black woman? No, but it is much more interesting to see a strong black woman in a place dominated by white men. I'll even compare it to Captain Holt from Brooklyn Nine Nine. Could Captain Holt have been just another white straight cop, sure it doens't change the show(at least the first season) that much, but again it is more interesting. At least to me.

So now, every opening weekend, I grab a couple nips of Dewars, buy an extra ticket for him, and put his Mickey Mouse keychain on the armrest so he can watch it with me, and I toast him and Bond whenever Bond drinks on-screen.

I recently moved out of state and this was my first opening weekend at a different theater than we used to go to...the end of this film felt especially poignant in that regard.

I think Safin's character and motivation were one of the weaker aspects of the film. I think Safin expected something like North Korea. Assuming he would have power and recognition as a sovereign nation because he controlled the means to apocalypse, mass pandemic, wiping out of powerful nations. It's not practical, because you'd have to expect direct and covert attempts to remove you from every threatened nation.  
I feel like the SPECTRE murder was what Safin saw as the most direct revenge on SPECTRE as an organization (for the killing of his family) and creating a power vacuum that he and his organization could instantly fill. It's not particularly well developed.  
  
I think M's motivations to create a secret bioweapon as a deterrent that could be used in a much more sinister method were more believable. (""Oh shit, oh shit, I really fucked up. Let me try to cover this up quietly."")

When Bond rescues him from SPECTRE (after he kills them for Safin), the scientist already knows that Ash is his contact to Safin.

Safin wanted SPECTRE to take the scientist, to place him close for his plan. Blofeld planned to kill Bond, but Safin's plan played out instead. Then, using Logan Ash and the CIA (manipulating Felix and Bond) they would extract the scientist for Safin's big endgame.

Ana de Armas was in the movie for like 5 minutes, but all the guys in my movie group agreed it was worth it, lol.

The death scene with the gripping soundtrack was good. I feel like killing your characters has been a theme for the past decade. Game of Thrones did it, Avengers did it. It's almost a cliché at this point. Audiences recognize it as a plot device. It's been done so much that the effect is watered down. So unfortunately they're working with a plot device that has seen a lot of use. But I think they did it tastefully. But imagine the splash if this had happened in Skyfall. That would've been spectacular.

Also, is it me or did Craig put on an American south accent at times? I feel like he sounded a lot like his detective character in Knives Out - that southern drawl. But I think it makes sense. The productions weren't far apart.

He accomplished his mission, but I agree it was weird he suddenly decides he wants to unleash the Heracles bioweapon on the world. 

> A lot of people are upset by Felix's death - I agree with the criticism that it is strange to have him killed off like that, especially by someone we don't know. I personally was not that bothered by it. He was a cool character, but I never really thought he was that emotionally significant. I was confused that Bond thought of him as 'a brother' since they never seemed that attached.

I agree the emotional connection was never really there.

He's taken away all the villains, I'm pretty sure orchestrated his own death at Bond's hand because he knew it would REALLY fuck Bond up, and got Safin to take away his family. The final blow is to infect Bond with Heracles so his world is truly empty. Safin's whole deal doesn't matter other than that he exists purely as a means to an end for Blofeld. This is also why Safin has all of SPECTRE's resources and men.

I'll explain my thoughts on Blofeld orchestrating his own death here for whoever's confused. In SPECTRE we see that the whole thing is cat-and-mouse to him; he's as outstanding a patient and expecting tactician as Bond is an escape artist, the true heads to Bond's tails. We see this at the end of SPECTRE where, with just a few hours' time, he manages to wire the old MI6 building to blow, fills it with traps, symbolism, and exposition, and puts Madeleine at the top of the building to fuck with Bond; he KNEW it would come to that showdown, and he had the whole thing ready to go. It's not difficult to imagine that the same mastermind would be able to expect Bond's visit, use his moles to set up a triggered trap such that when Bond is coming Safin goes to Madeleine, and he waits; he knows Madeleine won't go through with it, and he knows Bond will try to stop her. When he does, where will he grab? Her wrist. Put Heracles in a perfume and let her deliver it, but Bond is the true vector.

So naturally you might not get it if you only saw Craig’s angsty and brooding interpretation, which frankly was already at odds with previous incarnations of Bond. But this just took it to another level and took a massive steaming dump on everything Bond was ever supposed to be. Downright traumatizing to watch. Bond is NOT a man who just gives up and dies. Ever. He ALWAYS finds a way out of even the most insane situation. My jaw was hanging open for the whole last 10 minutes of this shithole film in utter disbelief. I waited in vain for the credits to end, unable to comprehend how what I just watched was real and not just some sick joke, a cruel parody of how Hollywood has to make absolutely everything dark and kill off absolutely everyone these days. I still can’t quite wrap my head around it being real. Unbelievably disrespectful to a decades old beloved franchise on the part of the writers, producers, and director.

And maybe the worst part of all?

THEY DIDN’T EVEN INCLUDE A TRIBUTE TO THE RECENTLY DECEASED SEAN CONNERY AND ROGER MOORE!

My problem is that this was too significant a departure from Bond. These movies are pure escapism for me, I love to see the character save the world and ride off into the sunset. 

Killing Bond feels like arrogance. James Bond surviving against all odds is ingrained into his character after 60 years. It's something we've been able to rely on, in dark times you can always trust that Bond will push through and survive.

I don't know how 'James Bond' can return when James Bond is dead..

Restarting with a new 007 (non James Bond) character will not be the same for me. You can trash me for that and call me a toxic male but it's just my opinion as a huge fan of the franchise.

She was so excited about the twist ending and I couldn't sort why I was having such a visceral reaction to it. Then it hit me...Bond doesn't die. We don't watch Bond movies for the character growth and the heart ripping endings. We watch because Bond is bulletproof, and no matter what ridiculous odds he faces, he survives. While his character assuredly needed recentering for today's audiences (the womanizing among other things), this ending was undeserved and unconscionable. I'm extremely disappointed in the franchise tonight. I hope whatever is next will wash the bad taste and tack back to the more escapist version of the  series we expect. I'm glad other people see and feel the same about it. Makes me feel less crazy.",q3nxx2
hg3610o,"I was thinking how you would overcome the problem of Bond being irrelevant in the modern world and the answer to me is two-fold. Much like Mr Robot, have Bond lean into the social engineering aspect of espionage - the weakest part of any system is human and Bond is a cool, charming and witty man who seduces women, is into drinking, gambling and sports to bond with male targets and has the humor and wit to befriend isolated assets. You can have the hard ass assassin edge but the focus of his work should primarily be espionage and infiltration exploiting human vulnerability and the lack of connection such a technological world brings. In this take technology doesn't invalidate Bond - It empowers him.

Cast someone younger, charismatic and dialogue focused, lean into that aspect of the character then have him make hard moral calls in the moment to justify the human presence rather than a remote laptop but he's still got the dark edge of exploiting the vulnerable for a higher cause. The American's (the show not the nation :P) did this really well.",q3nxx2
hg4217x,"I see the gripe about Safin killing SPECTRE and Blofeld running things from prison a lot, and it really just shows how little people paid attention through both films. 

In SPECTRE we find out Blofeld has been running governments behind the scenes for decades. He probably figured he'd be captured eventually and moved his chess pieces so he'd be in a presumably high security setup that he could communicate out of. We have no idea who was and wasn't on the payroll.

And he pretty much outright tells us outright that he orchestrated Safin's attack on SPECTRE, during the prison scene. I don't think they could have made it clearer unless they had him say ""oh yeah my boy Safin, out there poisoning motherfuckers for me."" It's pretty obvious that Safin was just another instrument for him to torment Bond, and honestly that dynamic was used really well. 

If you look at it from the surface level where you're just seeing Bind and Safin, yeah the movie wasn't that great. But there's so much built into this from previous Craig films, the books, and even previous entries in the franchise, that if you catch the call outs you know what's going on under the surface. 

That's probably not a great way to write the 25th entry in a massive franchise, but I think they took the shot because Endgame did it well, and this had that same level of sacrifice and finality written into it. And if you catch on to it, it works really well.

The Safin plot was pretty much directly lifted from the book You Only Live Twice and tweaked to fit where the story was after SPECTRE, and they threw in the On Her Majesty's Secret Service subplot (with a solid but somewhat expected twist where Bond dies instead of his wife) because they teased it so fucking hard at the end of SPECTRE, I mean jesus they could have lifted the pages right out of the book and thrown it onscreen--I was waiting for this one to open with her getting shot in the head as they drive off a cliff (though to be fair I stayed away from trailers, they spoil too much these days, and I realize now after watching them post-film that I would have known she was a bigger player, so I'm glad I let myself go in thinking she was going to die)",q3nxx2

Fleming wrote a brilliant three book story arc for Blofeld. He goes from a classy, calculating “evil M” in the Thunderball book to a insane psychopath living as a samurai lord in YOLT, due to his defeats by Bond.

He is in part based on “Hitler’s Favorite Commando” Otto Skorzeny who was a beast. He had the same fencing scars Donald Plesence had in YOLT. He genuinely worked after WWII with and organization that worked with, to name just one example, the Palestinians AND Israel. Scary dude, and one Fleming personally detested.

He was alive during the Connery years,

* The hidden folders of DNA sequences

* His talk to Bond about doing a more thorough removal of bad guys (or however he phrased it)

On the other hand, there's talk of buyers from the two boats coming towards the island. Also the fact that he apparently hasn't released any of it yet.

Seems like if he wanted to just kill the specifically targetted people, then according to how the organic nanobots apparently work - will spread and cannot be removed - it would seem he could have just been drizzling it out as he went, as soon as he had any of it with his desired DNA targetted.

I'm not really sure why he was producing so much of it, other than for speed of spread.

So bottom line. I think his plan was to both sell the finished product targetting specific individuals or families, and let loose product to kill the most immediate threats to him. 

I don't think that was at all clear, and I think he is, as a villain, weaker for it. But that's the only thing that makes sense to me.

Still doesn't explain why he wouldn't just spread some once he had it encoded to some if not all of his potential threats.

Everything after Cuba was vaguely incoherent, though, it was a big mistake (for me anyway) to try and make it into a sequel to Spectre, a film that always became increasingly incoherent.

But... It just felt like it fell flat. That forest scene seemed.... Slow. There was no uniqueness to it.

A certain characters death had no impact really. 

It was just very very average. At this rate Skyfall felt like the most like a Bond film to me, then Spectre and Casino Royale.

e: Also, thinking about this, I read a lot of Wikipedia. And usually I expect the a high caliber film like the Bond films to fall in line with whatever people put on those pages. On Wikipedia, they list the villain as *really getting under Bond's skin* or some shit. As if he's brilliant or clever or something. Watching the film, he didn't really get under Bond's skin. He was smart and skilled, but it wasn't as intricate as Blofeld. I don't know. It was just a let down. It could've been ... better.

In fact. When reading this sub-reddit and the film theories people had of what may happen, some of those (especially the concept of clones) would've been awesome/better/ideal/cool if they pulled it off right. I was just disappointed. Maybe I'd enjoy it more if I watched in theatres. I don't know. I liked the subtle nod/respect to the previous M.

But after it was all said and done ... that was it. There was more weight to the loss of the previous M than the way this film ended. As with all things where there's a series or set of films with a specific character, arc, or anything else, there's always some sort of falling flat. They could've cut down on that forest scene and added more of that Bond Girl, she was great. They could've added another scene with Felix to bring more weight to that.

They could've done so so much more. Just subtle little things would've made the film better. But reading my own complaints, I guess I sound like people who disliked Skyfall -- which, to this day I don't understand. It's one of the best Bond films to date.",q3nxx2

* Why was Nomi so absolutely awful to Bond straight-away? Is she a jealous high-schooler trying to prove she isn't impressed by one of the most respected spies in the history of MI6?
* Why was Ash such a dumb ""bro""? How stupid was he to try to buddy-buddy with Bond at the end of his life?

At the end of the day, this is a Bond film. The more plot added to it, the more holes they have to drill to allow for all the tropes and plot methods we've come to expect: Betrayals, cheesy one-liners (it blew his mind), silly gadgets and tools that are effective (peeling out with headlight-machine-guns), super-villains with secret lair islands that contain all their wealth/power (why wasn't the material farmed anywhere else?) and so on.

I know they had to do a lot of this to tie things off, and I liked the aesthetic homage to earlier Bond eras. But really, to enjoy this film you have to be a fan of both Bond in general, and a fan of the Craig era specifically.

Even in Casino Royale, I wasn’t legit worried about Bond or anyone’s safety. Here, everyone was marked for death, up to and including Bond himself, and as a result nearly every scene (especially in the beginning, in the forest, and at the end) was dripping in suspense for me. 

The first time around, I was on the edge of my seat when Bond began his rampage through the island base. I was afraid any minute there would be a stray bullet that might hit him.

She couldn't contribute to scenes in any way that made sense, so she just ended up being background scenery for the most part.

hg50g30,"> sizzling chemistry, great action and fantastic writing (all lacking in NTTD). No one can tell me any scene in NTTD compares favourably to that film's parkour or airport chases let alone the legendary meeting of minds on a train.

Eh. I’d argue a lot of NTTD’s action comes close to the parkour chase and surpasses the airport chase. Plus a ton of the dialogue in NTTD was much, much better written than I was ever expecting especially after Skyfall and Spectre which got downright cringeworthy with many of their lines. Either way, I don’t think it’s fair to expect a 50 year old Craig to be pulling off the same action scenes he was doing 15 years ago, and what I was pleasantly surprised by is that the action in NTTD was still 10x better than him sleepwalking through Skyfall and Spectre’s action scenes.

I don’t quite disagree with you though, I just never really expected any sequel to meet the incredibly high bar set by Casino Royale. The fact that NTTD even came close for me is frankly mind blowing (it’s my 2nd favorite or at least tied with Skyfall). Like you said, Casino Royale is an all time classic actioner in my mind. It’s on such a high pedestal that why would I be gutted that the next four sequels never surpassed it? That’s an unfair expectation.",q3nxx2

Edit:  Third or Fourth best Craig Bond movie.",q3nxx2
hg5eb4s,"I watched all 5 films in order the past week. QoS wasn’t brilliant but it benefitted from being grounded in the reality built in Casino Royale. It managed to tie some things up from Casino Royale. It wasn’t silly like Spectre or NTTD. I could totally imagine a billionaire/corporation backing a military general of a small nation to overthrow a dictator in return for their resources. In fact, something similar was happening at the time when it was exposed that some European banks were financially backing groups like this to feed off the debt that war creates. Unfortunately, the film had terrible editing and cinematography in the action scenes. It also lacked the dramatic punch that CR and Skyfall packs.

Spectre’s plot was just too silly. The retconning of the previous films to have Spectre behind it all just didn’t make much sense. Especially considering Silva was a stand alone film and villain. There was no need to shoehorn him in to Spectre. I also felt relating the big bad of the evil corporation to being Bond’s “brother” just too convenient in order to make the film “personal” in the same way CR and Skyfall felt. As such, I prefer QoS it.

NTTD I think was even worse. There’s things I liked about it. I liked the entire intro up to the theme song. I liked Ana de Armas’ character and I liked the Logan Ash character. I just feel that the film regressed even further into the whole bad guy on a secret island with a bunch of henchmen and scientists.

Both films failed to make the romance between Bond and Madeleine convincing. You have to make the audience fall in love with the love interest too for them to buy into it (it’s how every romcom works). They successfully did this with Vesper but Madeleine just felt to be devoid of personality.

I also felt Safrin needing to explain how him and Bond are the same to be contrived. Contrasted with Silva, they were both 00 agents who were victims of M’s seemingly cold hearted ability to dispose of her agents to achieve her goals. They both considered M to be a mother figure in their own weird orphan ways. Whereas Silva was motivated by revenge, Bond isn’t as cold hearted as we weee led to believe and risks his life to save hers.

Finally, it was obvious the had rewritten parts of the movie in postproduction to be about nanobots when it all indicates that it is biological ( the scientists at the start, Safrin being a botanist and them growing something on an island). Also, I can’t get over the EMP killing the cyclops guy but not only does Bond’s earpiece not blow up but it still works!",q3nxx2

M, Moneypenny, Q, and 007 share a drink and a short poem as a “farewell” to Bond, knowing they will never see him again.  007 receives the cigar meant for Felix in an envelope signed only by “from a friend”, implying the Bond/Felix MI6/CIA relationship-baton has been passed down to Ana/007.

* Using various gadgets
* Kill loads of people
* Save the world from ludicrously high-stakes plots.

Allow me to disagree with both points. The villain:

* Sets up a secret lab.
* Creates a super-weapon that threatens all of humanity.
* Manipulates a criminal mastermind's organisation to aid him, and simultaneously destroys that entire enterprise.
* But he also coopts 007 and the British Navy to cover his tracks, an act which threatens world peace.

Why did he hate James Bond so much that he’d go through all the effort of poisoning him like he did?

Nothing felt more than an inch deep. 

It would’ve also been way better if Bond wasn’t already 75% dead already when he got poisoned. That could have been an interesting plot point…forcing him into a choice of never seeing the ones he loved again vs saving himself. Instead it was just sort of hamstringed in there.

What was Safin’s purpose? Why was he trying to kill Mr White and his family at the start? Why the mask? He displayed none of the usual characteristics of a Bond villain, such as humour, intelligence, cunning or insanity. Where did he get the funds or resources to build that lab? At least with Spectre we understand that it’s a vast network of powerful individuals working together for selfish gain.

Blofeld’s contribution to the plot felt shoehorned in and rushed.

As you say, Madeline was just grumpy throughout her entire character arc, including in Spectre. Neither endearing nor likeable in the slightest. Why would she tell Bond her daughter isn’t his… twice.

But, for me, killing off Bond was the single biggest mistake they made with the plot. Bond is supposed to be able to get through any scrape - That’s part of his appeal. Or at least go down (pfnar pfnar) with a witty comment. I get that we’re no longer in the world of sexism and misogyny, but he ending was just far too heavy for a Bond film. I don’t believe with Q and the resources of the British Intelligence Services they couldn’t find a way to reverse (or at least disable) the nanobots.

On the plus side, I enjoyed the action sequences. The intro, if a little long, packed a punch and a few jumpy moments. The car chases (in Scandinavia) felt real.
The final action was intimate and the direction put you right in the middle of the action.

I also loved some of the cinematics. I only heard after watching the film that it was shot in IMAX and would have probably enjoyed it in that format - but I’ve never been to the cinema to see a film twice and won’t be starting with No Time To Die.

6/10",q3nxx2
hfwfrjv,Well said across the board.,q3nxx2
hfvodgb,"I couldn't disagree more on, well, so many of your thoughts.

I agree that Malek was a little bit of a weak villain, but the film wasn't really about his character, it was about Bond. Could it have been stronger? Sure, but frankly I hated the whole Blofeld nonsense of Spectre, which was massively convoluted and incredibly silly. Not that this wasn't - but the idea that Blofeld is the best villiain in the series is mad to me.

Lashana Lynch was great. That you decided she came off as cocky is... an interesting choice. For me, her whole role was to offer a counterpoint to Bond. She was the opposite of cocky. Measured, respectful of the rules, and humble enough to admit when Bond provided her with a lead. Did she have a couple of moments of confident cheek? Sure, but you want to see a cocky 007? You've literally 25 films to choose from.

Leya Seydoux is a terrific and nuanced actor who found herself in a big franchise with, if you'll excuse me, no time for in depth character development. I think she did the best with what she had - the only thing that I found a little off-putting was the clearly significant age difference. I found myself wondering what she saw in Bond more than what he saw in her.

Mallory's character development was great for me, given he'd come in as an antagonist for Dench's M and ultimately came to realise the challenges of the role, failing on a far greater level than his predecessor had.

Ana de Armas was great - I was hesitant initially, thinking she was playing a scatty cliché of a young woman out of her depth. But it was all a sleight of hand by a clearly skilled spy who offered some of the best moments of big actor stunt work in the film. It's a bit cheeky pitching her as second on the billing on posters, but I get how traditional Bond fans want their new Bond girl in every film, and that's what that played to.

I've seen a lot of compliments about Craig's acting in this, but there were points where he felt very off key. At lease twice he sounded like Jeremy Clarkson in his delivery of a line, which is not exactly something to aim for. Still, he carried the ending brilliantly.

The ending was perfect. A bold and decisive way to finish off the Craig era that all but demands a complete reboot with the next film (unless they did decide to keep the excellent supporting cast here and carry on with Lashana Lynch, who has room for a great development arc going forwards - though the 'James Bond Will Return' bit suggests the studio aren't ready to turn the Bond franchise into the 007 franchise just yet).

This was a great ending for a really interesting run of films that works, for the first time in the franchise, as a complete narrative arc complete with character development for Bond. I'd say my final rankings for the Craig era stand at:

1. Casino Royale
2. No Time To Die
3. Skyfall

The emotion in this film and the sincere focus on Bond as a character was just beautiful, and they STILL included some of the grittiest darkest moments yet and pulled off some fresh creative action scenes that brought back most of the grit and intensity of CR/QOS’s action which again, I never thought was possible after the lamer slower direction the action scenes went in Skyfall and especially Spectre.",q3nxx2

I wish there was something redeeming about Quantum but honestly I'd rather Craig's arc be 2 movies (Casino & Skyfall) than include Quantum.

I agree that there wasn't really a villain in this film and it's clear the the writing preferred to just neatly wrap up Craig's Bond in a very neat and very audience-appealing way.

Somehow they made it feel rushed in 2.5hr. Big thumbs firmly down. I need to watch Casino Royale and Skyfall 6 times each to un-do the damage to my brain.

The action scenes are laughably unrealistic (I know all Bond action scenes are unrealistic, of course, but these are a different level). Like Lashana Lynch and Ana de Armas casually leaning sideways firing big, automatic weapons with one hand? I mean come on. It's like something out of Pamela Anderson's VIP detective series.

Everything felt cheapened and OTT. And then the biggest insult of all - killing Bond off at the end. Who the fuck thought that was a good idea? And it's not open to debate, the director has stated that he is 100% dead and that he showed the shots of the whole island being pummelled to make that very clear.

It just doesn't work that well though to introduce 5 leading and connected villains over only \~12 hours of content. They didn't even bother with motivations in NTTD, Malek’s character is just arbitrarily evil.

Hard to say what they'll try next... I hope it's more of a return to form too but wouldn't be surprised if they try to reinvent the franchise.",q3nxx2
hgryrjq,"I totally agree. There were a few films that were linked in some form (TSWLM and Moonraker for example) but this long dragged out emotional backstory of Bond across multiple films is too much. NTTD's plot and narrative, along with pacing was a mess and full of holes that could have been easily avoided, not to mention this created a massive confusion on the nanobot/virus plot.

In addition to the fuzzy plot, because it's a continuation of the very long Craig's Bond, you have tons of references and scenes that you can only get the full context from watching the other films.

To the point of individual movies, they are tons better because you get a full story, whether new to the franchise or a regular and most importantly they are interchangeable with each other. Each film was designed as a singular adventure and you could watch them in nearly any order you wished.

What really annoys me is that they've sacrificed various core characters for zero trade-off to the audience. Felix Leiter dying did what exactly? Didn't add shock factor, just annoyance to myself. To be killed off by some newbie who was a ""baddie"" all along in which was really baldly revealed.

Bond dying at the end is the result of the blood vial spilled on him from Safin which was from Madeline Swan. So Swan just forgot to omit to Bond when they met up just before they get onto the boat that ""oh you know that WMD that we've all been on about, yeah he has my blood and DNA"". So because she forgot, he gets blown up. What? lol

Safin in general was a good villain, but so much more needed to be explained - his revenge at the start of the film shows he wants an eye for an eye but also shows he has moral feelings, by saving child Madeline. Fast forward to after him killing Spectre, now he wants to kill the world because why now? Change of the moral feelings, or just an excuse to make Bond be a direct rival.

Romi was just a cocky character and unlikable. I feel it would have been better if they broke into each other and got along in the end. 

Overall it was a very poor attempt of pacing, full of plot holes that drove serious elements of the story, sacrificing characters and even Bond without a good reason to explain.",q3nxx2

However, just a thought on the gun barrel opening scene: It's not a traditional opening scene since, like you said, it's not what Bond has been up to but it's a flashback and in the timeline of the movie, Bond is out of the game so he isn't up to anything so to speak. If the gun barrel opening has always been to drop us into the action or mission in which Bond currently is in, then this one is different because there's nothing to drop us into. We get the 'real' gun barrel scene towards the end which feels like a much more appropriate, usual shot, rather than the opening scene. Rather satisfying too-

Casino Royale dropped us into the mission in Madagascar, Quantum of Solace opens with the fantastic car chase in Italy(?), Skyfall opens with the mission in Istanbul, Specter in Mexico City and NTTD... Madeleine's flashback and then Bond's retired life. No action to drop us into.",q3nxx2

And then when he's poisoned, he just gives up! What? Like he immediately just decides to die. And why don't EMPs work on nanobots? Why have him poisoned if he's already gravely wounded from being shot? It seems like the missiles would've killed him anyway, because he couldn't really move properly. Anyway, all that sucks. 

But after Bond dies, there like a 1 minute scene where M recites 2 lines from a book and no one else speaks, and then Madeline says whatever to her daughter and then it just *ends*.

>
>1. Felix Leiter's death. His death didn't seem to have a purpose other than for Bond to mention ""I had a brother too"" to Logan Ash before killing him. which brings me to...

Don't forget the touching homage to the way Vesper died in CR! Lol. 

>2. Logan Ash's betrayal. I think double agent should have a good reason to betray the protagonist, whereas Logan's betrayal felt like it was there only to drive the plot.

Agreed, I didn't care about Ash because short of killing Felix, I didn't know him. It was satisfying when he died though. 

>3. Blofeld. SPECTRE's mastermind, Bond's nemesis. It felt a little cheap to have him die so suddenly. Perhaps it was to make Safin appear more powerful, but I hope SPECTRE returns at some point (despite the death of its members and Blofeld)
>4. Safin. I think he is a well designed Bond villain. He began with a personal vendetta against Madeleine's family and SPECTRE , but somewhere along the way decided to eradicate half the world. I wished there was more backstory to his motives, but maybe it's even scarier to have a villain who wants kill half the world with no motive at all. Safin has potential, and he did kill Blofeld, so I kinda wanted to see him become the next ""Blofeld"". 
>5. Bond's death. It's kind of a running gag to see Bond escape death in the most ridiculous manner, so it's pretty touching to see him die on his own accord to protect his family.

hg2hgpw,"1. Blofeld/Spectre had direct connection with the scientist thru previous crimes. Said multiple times in the movie. Especially when Bond is giving M shit for not getting rid of the scientist (after Bond foiled their plans) and instead putting him, a criminal scientist, on payroll to develop a weapon for M. When Safin calls the scientist before the heist you can surmise the scientist has been selling info and been in Safin's pocket for a while. A villain scientist going back to working with other villains? hmmm
2. Q and Moneypenny said there have been ongoing hacks all across the world (especially blood banks) and now that they knew about the nanobots, they attributed the hacks to someone collecting DNA for the nanobots. A whole scene dedicated to giving this backstory as they're finding out what's on the flashdrive in Q's house.
3. The whole opening + multiple instances of the backstory repeated: Safin's dad was killed by Madeleine's dad (who worked for Spectre). Safin was out for revenge.
4. This they could've done a better job at explaining. Basically he wants to eliminate organizations/groups across the world in an almost ""if i kill ppl with this bioweapon we can establish peace and  control""
5. You can safely assume he was either told by his goonies or saw himself that nuclear blast doors open and realized they were going to bomb and destroy his nanobot factory. He wasn't too concerned about living and it's evident his goonies have failed him. Is it genius levels of writing a villain? i don't think so, but it's not too terrible of a reach.
6. Movie handwave magic that can be explained by ""Q made it be EMP-proof.""
7. M mentioned all Blofeld does is mumble shit in his cell. It's still a reach and meh writing, but it's basically blofeld mumbling that looks like he's talking to himself (and gone crazy as pointed out by M/moneypenny) and him having the fake eye to look through.
8. He was infected. Even if he stays away from Madeleine and his daughter, every single person he comes in contact with will be infected. the nanobots will transfer from person to person and AT SOME POINT it's basically guaranteed it will reach Madelein/daughter. It'd be insane levels of odds to bet on them not dying through nanobots getting to them. Even if they figure out how to shut nanobots off they'd have to somehow find and ""vaccinate"" every single person james accidently infects.
9. super fast incoming planes were explained by Q going ""oh guess we've been flagged"" then M getting calls from Russian, China, and Japan all asking why a British plane was flying around contested waters. They were jets from one of these countries basically telling the cargo plane to identify itself.
10. Yup, was sometimes jarring watching him walk away while people were shooting at him, but was a relatively small gripe personally. 

I just feel like your and some of the others leaving comments were tuned out for 90% of the movie and then saying the movie didn't make sense. Did it have problems. Sure. The rewrites moving the plot away from a virus/bacteria weapon because of COVID was pretty apparent, but some of these questions were literally answered multiple times throughout the movie...
Did you not watch this in theaters? Audio was quite clear. Maybe a line or two was muffled by Safin near the end, but everything was clear. No scene was too dark either.

That said, I think maybe Bond could have made it to the water or at least out of the compound and took shelter behind some boulders.

So to try and keep afloat in the middle of the ocean would have been a tough task. Plus concussive shockwaves from those missiles would actually be more enhanced/faster in water vs air if he were nearby, not to mention the debris.

hhxnt9g,"Leave it to reddit to down vote for your unpopular opinion. But I agree with you for what it's worth. Bond, the character, is timeless. That's what makes him BOND. There is no timeline in the universe of Bond. The rules have always been, bond can't die. Also, Bond doesn't die that way. The man is all about ""for country"" not ""for pussy"" and he's stubborn and he's gritty. He wouldn't simply give up if he couldn't be with his woman. He wouldn't except ""there's nothing we can do"" when told he can't get rid of the nano tech. He would stubbornly say find a way and he would survive. He would be happy to see his daughter grow up even if he couldn't touch her and he would impatiently wait for them to cure him so he can touch her. If he was surrounded by bad guys shooting at him with no way out, sure, he'd blow up in a mess of glory. But he doesn't go down quiting. Bond. Doesn't. Quit. Period. 

I'm fine with the idea to kill him, I don't agree, but I'm fine with it. The execution was what I had a problem with. The absolute worst way to write the death of a 50 year old character. Don't worry, they'll all down vote me now.",q3nxx2

He isn't threatened or scared by main antagonist. He get's involved with them verbaly first then acts because most of the time he is calm . 

For me, Nomi gave an impression that she was threathened by Bond, somewhat insecure. If she felt like that with bond, how would she then react to main antagonist?  She lacks those core Bond characteristics: charm, finesse, that everything is just so natural to her 007 status. She doesn't give a Bond vibe. I believe there are possible better actresses that could be next female bond. Even Moneypenny gives more of a Bond vibe to me than Nomi.",q3nxx2

Until the end, when the main villian decides to shoot him and has pinpoint accuracy,  but then lets himself be killed for no reason, as we've determined hes clearly an idiot whose survived on dumb luck this entire time.

hkf17mh,"Just got out and have the exact opposite opinion as yours haha.   


My personal view on why I love the cruelty of killing bond:

&#x200B;

It's been noted that he is a product of a bi-gone era and although we might love him, he's a damaged man who has lived a life of death and torment. He was brought up as a literal child soldier to be a weapon of death as a hand of the Brtish government. The way he acted towards Madeline at the start of the movie proves this, he constantly looks over his shoulder, he cannot find any trust in her honest answers, he physically abuses her because he doesn't know how to express his own emotions. 

A child might bring something to his life, but it won't change him like it would others. Remi's character is fantastic in that he's a weedy evil creepy dude that just wants to see the world burn. He is the exact anthesis to the calculated yet irrational Bond. He doesn't need to be evil for the sake of world domination, or a brute that can take on Bond on a physical or mental level, he's already beaten them. He literally cheats Bond's death, and he likely knew exactly what he was doing when he marched on him at the end. He'd rather know the last thing he see's is a form of ultimate suffering because he's a psychotic sociopath.",q3nxx2
hkimim8,"""give the already dead villain his victory""

It is weird, now that you mention it.  James Bond kind of committed suicide.  Not very Bond like",q3nxx2
hkfbrcp,"For me it had a gaping plot hole that should have let Bond live and have a happy ending. The virus is a nanovirus, meaning tiny machines in his bloodstream. Q gives him a watch that emits a apparently large enough EMP to knock out cameras throughout the facility and should have been enough to knock out the nanobots in his bloodstream... For me this made the ending feel a little contrived and a little forced.",q3nxx2
hkfz7v4,"Hear. Hear. Not the worst Bond movie (TWINE), but probably the most disappointing. Cut 55 minutes, stick with a single screenwriter / team, cut 1/2 the minor characters, and end with Bond +  family happily ever after.",q3nxx2

hg8i72z,">Naomi (007) also, for that matter? She told him to meet her

I don't think she was surprised. She initially said Bond should stay out of it, but also expected Bond to be Bond and ignore that advice.",q3nxx2
hftj3zk,"if Bond had lived, he totally would have given his daughter a joke gun as a birthday gift too",q3nxx2
hfxdacq,"Agreed. Pierce is mine as well, although I think Craig had the benefit of having overall better films.",q3nxx2
hfxhb84,"Honestly, if I could make one general criticism to most of the Craig Bond films, it’s that the main villain gets very little screen time and/or has little time to provide proper motivation and conflict with Bond, making them feel weak.

-	*Quantum of Solace*: Greene had plenty of screen time but wasn’t an intimidating villain; more of a geo nerd.
-	*Skyfall*: We barely see Silva and his planning/luck is far too good for many of the action scenes, but at least he’s kinda cool.
-	*Spectre*: not much screen time and the whole angry at half-brother (cuckoo’s nest) felt weak. Really underutilized Christoph Waltz.
-	*No Time to Die*: Safin has little screen time and his motivations for wanting to produce so much toxin was to commit genocide… I think? Wasn’t really clear.

*Casino Royale* is a stand out with Le Chiffre: he has plenty of screen time and many interactions with Bond; bloody eye thing gives him a sinister appearance; feels grounded as a villain because he has high stakes (paying off financial debts or else…); and a cool actor to play him. One of many reasons why CR stands far above the other Craig Bond films.",q3nxx2
hg34w03,"They said it was a birthday party for Blofeld, they were all celebrating him. Which is pretty hilarious but it makes sense he and his people would try to orchestrate a theatrical death for Bond as part of the celebration…it completely fits what Blofeld and Spectre wants and it fits his pretty absurd theatrical characterization in the Craig movies. 

It’s a stretch that they expected him to be there (given he retired), I don’t have a good explanation for that. Might have just been a nice bonus there. I’m veering into headcanon here but Logan Ash could’ve been orchestrating it too since he and Felix are who convinced Bond to go to Cuba - Ash worked for Safin, not Spectre, but we know the two of them were tracking Spectre’s movements and waiting for the right times to interfere in their plans (like when Safin calls to warn the scientist at the start).",q3nxx2
hg2f5e7,That was a major plot of this film and the reason for it should have been explained better.,q3nxx2
hg3hy4p,"Yea this is what I don’t understand. Cyclops was with Specter in the flash back, then Safin when stealing the virus, the back with Specter at the party and then back with Safin after that?

About the villain; fell flat for me. The plot etc did not really do much for me. The strong aspect of this film was character interactions and bonds, loved them.",q3nxx2
hh2x1ky,"As far as M in concerned, I think the ambiguity was on purpose.

hh12ryd,"> This issue of ambiguity is something I noticed throughout with a few of the characters. Even M gave me baddy vibes at one point, because of the whole Heracles thing and his unwillingness to cooperate. Not sure if the ambiguity was on purpose or a result of bad scripting.

Bond at the end was fighting for everyone and family, not just Her Majesty's Secret Service.  He even rejected them early on to work for the CIA, mainly 'cause he trusted his ""brother"" (Felix).",q3nxx2
hkht1e2,"Just saw it for the first time (and Skyfall and Spectre too) and agree with you. The interconnected stuff annoyed me the most. Skyfall walked the line of continuity well, but Spectre and now NTTD just went all in on the ridiculous connections. Blofeld being James' secret brother and claiming credit for every bad thing that happened to Craig's Bond (""It was Blofeld all along!"") made me laugh and want Bond to say ""I have no idea who the fuck you are, mate"". Same with some rando being the love of his life all of a sudden.

I didn't like the new female 007 (Noomi?) though. Not the actor's fault, but she felt miscast. No sense of suave charm just a blunt instrument. I am still sad we never got a Jinx spinoff but feel Eve Moneypenny would be a fantastic (and better) choice if they want a standalone ""female Bond"" movie or franchise.

I think the film was a fitting Daniel Craig sendoff, and I think it's an appropriate end for Bond to sacrifice himself for the world he'd saved time and time again.  It would feel kind of cheesy for him to get the happily ever after I think, or at least it would if it weren't handled very carefully.  The end we got is definitive, conclusive for Daniel Craig, and I think there's no way to bring him back that wouldn't come across as cheap or kind of lame.  Just one mans opinion though.",q3nxx2

I think I would rather have a total reboot at this point.  They really didn't leave that much to build off of when you come down to it.

If the focus of this movie are Bond + Madeline, then you can probably cut off the entire Felix plot with the American agent subplot, or merge that with the Cuba subplot so that Ana de Armas' character can take over Felix's role in the future.

If the focus is the villain, then lol. The initial scene in the movie was setting up the villain to be similar to the Skyfall villain (avenging a past injustice against Madeline, but then saves her and maybe we get more flashbacks).

Mr. Robot built a strain of the nanobots that would kill Madeline and Matilda, he infected himself and Bond with it during their fight which means that Bond would kill them if he ever came into contact with them or even through a chain of separation came into contact with them... ie. if he touched Q who then later touched either of them they would die because the bots spread through contact from person to person.

What else do you expect? A roaring standing ovation for a movie? Only fanboys clap in the cinema, everybody else thinks that's cringe.",q3nxx2
hkb7ont,"Another thing that popped up as I reread this comment is Bond basically being invincible.  I can't really discount the fact that the henchmen fall like flies, except maybe by saying that maybe they're just little better trained than your average infantryman (not trying to sell short the skill of anyone in the military, just comparing them to who is supposed to be the greatest special operative on the planet essentially), so the skill differential is just that wide?  I dunno, that's not really the point I'm going after.  

What I'm curious about, as a person who's never been shot, is what it's like to be shot.  Presumably Bond has been shot many times, and while I'm sure it's incredibly painful, to what extent is a human being, especially one at the highest level of training and discipline like Bond, able to overcome and power through that pain and debilitation.  It's pretty common in movies for people to die instantly from things that pretty much any average person would survive.  The human body is incredibly resilient, so for someone who's experienced pain beyond pain, been shot dozens of times if not more, etc. etc. their ability to push through would seem incredibly unrealistic.  I'm not saying that they should be able to survive everything, but their ability to function through even extreme levels of bodily damage is not evidence of a lack of realism.  Having said that, you see way too often someone suffering silently after being shot, especially being shot in the stomach or something like that.  Apparently that is incredibly painful, and the person would likely be screaming in absolute agony.

I don't remember the movie specifically enough to know that that's totally relevant, it could be overplayed in NTTD, and definitely is in something like the John Wick movies, even though I love how you can see his level of exhaustion increase over the course of those movies considering it all takes place in a few days or a week or whatever.  I mean generally in those movies I'll just accept that the greatest assassin of all time would be able to function through almost anything, but there's no playing through the pain when you've got legs that should be broken and whatnot.  He definitely should be crippled in a few places.",q3nxx2
hkan4of,"So I totally respect your opinion and appreciate the effort you put into explaining it.  I'm not going to refute it all, you make some decent points.  But there are a couple things to say.  First off, I'm pretty sure the plan wasn't to kill Bond when Vesper's tomb exploded, it was to convince Bond that Madeleine had set him up and drive a wedge between them, which worked.  Remember also that Bond plays in the world of the greatest deceivers and manipulators on the planet, I find it reasonable for him to question that she might be one of these people and revert to his cold, care-for-nothing persona.  Remember also that Blofeld just loves tormenting Bond, he wants to cause him as much pain as possible, so breaking his heart again rather than killing him outright seems pretty in line with the character.  He eventually planned for Bond's death to be pretty much a ceremony, even though it blew up in his face.  I guess I can't explain why it took him 5 years.

The other thing I want to address is the idea of Bond as the ultimate male fantasy and the idea that we don't know what that looks like anymore.  I totally agree with both points, the male fantasy did used to reflect the core of what Bond always was, but I think shifting that away from what it was isn't necessarily harmful, it could be considered character development.  Craig's Bond was always different from Bond's that came before.  He was able to open up his heart to Vesper, something very un-Bondlike, and got crushed for it.  This led to a long period of him being closed off, but he eventually opened himself up again.  Maybe Bond should stay the same, maybe not, but it's alright to have different takes on a character in my opinion.  If you don't like it, it's entirely possible that they'll undo it all with the next iteration of Bond, where he will go back to being a master seducer and all that.  

I don't know if that kind of character reflects the world we live in anymore though.  The traditional, old-school traits of manliness that Bond used to embody used to be the pinnacle of male fantasy, but as time goes on that seems kind of a shallow interpretation of the peak of manliness these days.  Nowadays it's cool to care, and so seeing this guy we're supposed to idolize just use and toss girl after girl, it doesn't come across as cool, I guess.  Characters are allowed to have flaws, it's true, and Bond isn't meant to be flawless, but personally, I was happy to see a Bond where his attitude towards women wasn't just as meaningless pursuits, and the emotional walls he put up weren't invincible.  Maybe the idea of seduction has worn on him over the years, and he doesn't enjoy it like he used to.  We do see flashes of flirtatious behavior that show he's still smooth as ever, and I don't think he has to sleep with these girls to be suave.
Again, this is all my personal opinion, I respect where you're coming from.  I agree that the villain was underdeveloped and the plot wasn't the most original.  I think it did serve well as a vehicle for the emotional development and for Bond accepting the necessity of his sacrifice at the end.  If Bond had hope he could have lived happily ever after, you can be sure he would have fought like hell to get out of the line of fire, but since his existence would only serve as a threat to the people he loved, he just stood his ground.  The entire thing is really an argument over whether or not a particular franchise should stick to its established niche, or if it should evolve.  Arguments can be made in either direction, and the answer is probably some combination of both.  If a franchise doesn't change with the times, it will eventually grow stale and irrelevant.  But if it changes too much, you endanger losing the core of what made it great in the first place.

So I went back and reread your arguments, and I realized I'm not really arguing against the points you made in a lot of places.  So I hope you take what's relevant from my comment and the rest consider just opinion.  Bond is definitely in a weird spot, it's what, a 60 year old series?  It's been pretty consistent in its tone until it sort of when off the rails at the end of the Brosnan era.  So they had a tough task to rein it in while keeping the essence of the character but at the same time making it different enough that they're not just rehashing.  That's a crazy fine line to walk, and I'd say they did it more successfully than not.  At a certain point, all world ending plots seem sort of eye rolling.  Maybe it's time to localize the threat so that not every movie is just another way for a villain to obtain or develop a doomsday weapon/virus/chemical etc.  At the same time though, that little bit of unreality when it comes to technology and what not is part of what makes Bond great, seperating it from a lot of other spy stuff.  In that situation as a writer, when you're trying to make something fresh but still in line with the spirit of such an iconic series, that's pretty daunting.  Maybe it does come across as quaint these days, so I wouldn't be surprised if we see even more seperation from tradional Bond-ness in future films.

This comment went on way too long, I hope there's at least something in there that you consider relevant enough to further the conversation.  I definitely feel I got away from the intention of your comment in places.  Thanks for putting in the effort to voice your thoughts in the first place!",q3nxx2

I think he know enough French to loosely communicate but that’s it.",q3nxx2
hgeqn40,"To be fair, we were lucky to get her 10 min of screentime at all: she was texted by the director after production had already started if she wanted to be in the movie after Craig kept recommending her to the director after he loved working with her on Knives Out. They then wrote her character into the movie *last minute* and she crammed it into her schedule, doing all her stunt and gun training in two weeks before she shot. The whole “I only had three weeks training!” is basically a meta inside-joke for how her character literally was thrown into the movie last minute. This is why her brief sequence ends with her just dropping out of the entire movie — the time we had with her was the only time they had to shoot with her.

Turns out Craig and the director were 100% right to add her in since she turned out to be one of the best parts of the entire movie and steals all her scenes. I would 100% watch a spinoff with her.

TL;DR: that she’s even in the movie at all and KILLS her scenes is a scheduling miracle and a testament to how hard Ana de Armas works and trains. She deserves every bit of praise for her brief role in the movie!",q3nxx2
hgknwgh,I think it is likely she will return in the next Bond as a new US contact. When they recast bond they don't always recast the entire cast and it seemed like their last dialogue implies she will return,q3nxx2

hfy2ios,Yeah his character seems to be the one thing that everyone agrees was weak.,q3nxx2

hfzs8au,"Everything made sense to me until he goes after both of them in the SUV with the kid.

I suppose the idea was he was worried they would figure out what he was doing and they would go after him. But, eliminating him would not stop MI6 from poking around anyway, if anything escalate it. And using the kid as leverage over bond wasn't going to solve his issue either. Get off my island, ok, and then?",q3nxx2
hfyef1v,They tried to make Safin's plot personal to the story and it just wasn't necessary.  It would have been better to just make him Dr. No and leave out the entire plot where he was connected to Madeleine.  They needed to go go all-in in one direction: make his story more personal to Madeleine or not personal at all.  They went halfsies and it just didn't work.  Because like you said: everyone is left confused or dissatisfied with his motivations.,q3nxx2

“Wait why does he want to wipe out the world again?”

And I still didn’t get it. I’m still unsure of his motivation.",q3nxx2
hk5i2ur,I think they just intentionally didn't have him monologue about them. He was kind of an inversion of a Bond villain until the very end where it turns out he stayed to sink with his ship.,q3nxx2
hg55dhq,"I assume that he’s wealthy because of criminal exploits. They said that his father owned that poison farm. I just assumed that Safin took over the business when his family was killed.

My problem is not understanding why he wants to kill millions of people around the world or even who he is targeting.",q3nxx2
hhgq4jk,"Not only was he wealthy, but he was wealthy enough to have an evil island base and yet for some reason never managed to kill Mr White.  A guy Bond found pretty quickly on his own at the end of the first mission.",q3nxx2
hoxrst2,"Speaking of cliches, I think they lifted some of his dialogue from Avengers Age of Ultron.


Ultron: ""*I'm sorry, I know you mean well. You just didn't think it through. You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change. How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to...evolve?*""


Safin: ""*We both eradicate people to make the world a better place. I just want to be a little… tidier. Without collateral. I want the world to evolve, yet you want it to stay the same.*""


And I thought it was just a weird movie to be stealing from, since Safin and Ultron are otherwise nothing alike.",q3nxx2
hphh7xa,">They didn’t even expand on how this kid who had his family all murdered became ultra wealthy and powerful.

Safin didn't have his own family killed, Swann's dad had killed them. That's the whole reason Safin shows up to Swann's childhood home in the beginning, to kill Swann's dad and the whole family in revenge.

One weird thing they never addressed though is whatever happened to Swann's dad since Safin only killed the mom.

edit: you really downvoted this, misterperiodtee? Safin did not have his family killed ffs.",q3nxx2
hoxt3l9,">Safin has used genetic engineering to maintain his youth, and now plans to use it to reshape humanity to his image.


There, that's the missing motivation from the final version of the movie. Also explains why some of his lines sounds like they used a script of Avengers Age of Ultron by accident:


Ultron: ""*I'm sorry, I know you mean well. You just didn't think it through. You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change. How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to...evolve?*""


Safin: ""*We both eradicate people to make the world a better place. I just want to be a little… tidier. Without collateral. I want the world to evolve, yet you want it to stay the same.*""",q3nxx2
hnan1rw,Very interesting. What was the source for this?,q3nxx2
hgelsjd,"That’s exactly what they did with Spectre. It was the last movie Craig was contractually obligated to make so they wrapped up the story. Blofeld was behind everything that happened and was the ultimate baddie. This wasn’t enough for everyone tho and people shit on Spectre. They were upset because it seemed he only became bad to get back at his little brother. Something I think is false as he was gonna turn out bad no matter what. He even says Bond kept “getting in the way” of his plans so he got fed up and decided to take him out. 

I agree it would have worked better if Spectre/Blofeld was the baddie at the end of 5 but they couldn’t do that given everything that happened outside of the movie. It was still a missed opportunity to not make Safin into Dr. No. it would have brought this reboot full circle IMO.",q3nxx2
hh4717o,"I don't think he was targeting any group in particular, just selling to the highest bidder .",q3nxx2

And that villain also dresses up as a cop at one point to attempt assassination on elder colleague/parental figure of the protagonist.

He could change the world as he saw fit by basically marking anyone, anywhere (as long as he had their DNA sample) for death.

Add to that he could sell a copy with specific targets, and the people who bought it couldn't do anything with it besides use it to kill or threaten/blackmail their target as they didn't have the farm or the genius Russian scientist.

Otherwise yea, plot armor.",q3nxx2
hftv25h,The EMP range is slightly less than the distance from Bond’s wrist to his head.,q3nxx2
hg4d6bf,"I thought of that but figured it was just a very small radius effect, bc the watch was basically next to the guys eye",q3nxx2
hfyosua,I thought the same thing! What luck!,q3nxx2
hgg0urj,"Besides the range being unknown and thus could easily be ""as far as his eye, but not Bond's ear"", his earpiece wasn't bluetooth but Secret Service style wired. Speakers are often analog, so the circuitry for it could be further from his ear than we see.",q3nxx2
hg6fw10,"In a campier version, Bond would have quipped along the lines of “that’ll make your eyes pop” or similar instead of the line used in the movie.",q3nxx2

hftp4ah,Clumsy yet still competent. She’s great.,q3nxx2
hfugd98,"I really enjoyed that aspect of her. She looked insanely hot like other ""Bond girls"", but she also wasn't this eye-piercing experienced agent that is like ""I will kick you in the balls, Bond"".

She's never been on a mission this big and it shows. Even when Bond tries to seduce her, she is all about the mission and is like ""Uh, no, I'm sorry, just put the tux on, please?""

Perfect balance between inexperience but not stupidity.",q3nxx2
hfucv0e,Yeah her scene was great. Kind of ironic given how long the runtime was but it felt like her part was cut really short. Like they made all this effort to introduce her and then she just ducks out the second after they capture the scientist.,q3nxx2
hfu6pbp,"> I wouldn't mind they make a spin-off of Paloma.

The way they had her abruptly leave with James' ""hope to see you again"" definitely made me think this was a backdoor pilot for a spin off.",q3nxx2

hg0i0b8,"The exposition dump scene where the nanobots are revealed seems pretty clearly edited to change to nanobots from something else. Anytime the word ""nanobots"" or anything clearly referencing them is used in that scene, the actor speaking is offscreen. And the images of nanobots on the computers are all shown in isolation and could easily be done in post.",q3nxx2
hg5plxn,I’m pretty sure it was suppose to be spread by mosquitos. There’s a scene in the car with Matilda where she literally has a minute long monologue about being bit by mosquitos. Foreshadowing perhaps? Just a theory.,q3nxx2

hg763h5,When did blofield have a bionic eye ?,q3nxx2
hfxe1up,"Bio-nanobots. Hence why they were ""growing"" them. Idk lol. Someone else speculated that it was Hong to be a regular bio-weapon but they changed it because of covid.",q3nxx2
hfu4ysw,"it's certainly well done. I really love Cary, but at this points it's his signature. I spent a couple seconds before every action sequence thinking... "" This will be it""",q3nxx2
hfvtull,He also did a great tracking shot in Beast of No Nation,q3nxx2
hfxp6gd,I just enjoy short and sweet goodbyes so much more than grandiose dragged out speechs. It hits harder for me and it's what bond would want anyway in this case I think. Super classy and straight forward.,q3nxx2
hgb9qlv,"I kept thinking “ok now Bond is gonna say a quippy line and surprise everyone.”

Then I remembered he was obliterated by missiles.",q3nxx2
hm08t1z,"I mean, in that respect this movie had more balls, in that it actually killed off the main character in the end. Dark Knight Rises kind of wimped out in the end.",q3nxx2
hg0rq1v,Mr Robot took the kid and Elliot didn't know why.,q3nxx2
hg2nk12,"Thought that was weird at first too but I felt it was a way to humanize Safin a tad since he had no real interest in harming her. Plus his leverage was having Bond thinking he had her more than actually having her. Maybe not better this way but I do think it works, especially since he got Bond anyway.",q3nxx2
hg239s2,"I mean, he did get Bond in the end.",q3nxx2
hgg2fnp,"He was using the kid to control her mother, and since she had already escaped by that point, he was probably over it. He also probably expected to have to use the insurance against Bond.",q3nxx2
hg0jr06,I guess he counted on meeting Bond again and sticking him.,q3nxx2
hkl4d53,"It was all a ruse right? He wanted to be alone with Bond to spray him, knowing that Bond would never be able to set foot off the island again on the risk of whoever he comes into contact with will have the virus spread to Madeline and his daughter. He wanted to have the daughter going with his mother as a ploy for Bond",q3nxx2
hg2dpcn,He swapped the original usb full of blofled’s targets with Safin’s that only targeted spectre agents,q3nxx2

hg2g5s3,Dude wanted to steal a gigantic fuckin diamond. Is that not motivation enough?,q3nxx2
hfwwdw6,The beginning flashback scene with Madeline,q3nxx2
hfts69s,"Totally, Casino Royale and Quantum made sense with their barebones tone because they were essentially prequels. Skyfall was a great movie but still had to do a lot of table setting (introducing M, Q, and Moneypenny), and Specte was just a bit too muddled. It's a shame that they nailed the balance of fun and grit until the very last film, because it was perfect. Ideally they keep this balance when they pull in a new Bond.",q3nxx2
hfte8n6,Agreed. It's not my favorite of his movies but I think it does the best job at both being a serious action movie and being a little bit goofy in the way that classic bond movies are. That's a tough balance to achieve but I think they nailed it.,q3nxx2
hftoxlt,"I agree, I thought Spectre was too light-hearted and goofy, but this movie had a nice balance of seriousness and being funny.",q3nxx2
hg2l5kd,"Casino Royale is definitely the tonal sweet spot for me (more grounded and serious), but yeah, this film took me back to the early James Bond movies, which I definitely don't mind either.",q3nxx2
hfz7zrd,That and the henchman with a gimmick. In this case the guy with the bionic eye.,q3nxx2
hfw95lk,"*No* Time To Die, his island lair, his clothes at the end, the glass/cybernetic eyes, there were tons of references to this being basically an homage to dr. No. There were quite a lot of nods to older movies as well throughout. It really felt like a huge send off, not just for Bond but for the franchise itself. It said Bond will return, and I’m sure that’s true… but I think we may have witnessed the last of what we could consider the “classic” films in the future.",q3nxx2
hfv0nxr,Reverted to the mean.,q3nxx2
hl6d2yk,"I think it'd be cool for them to dial up the camp a bit more, and set the next one in the 60's.",q3nxx2
hg2q9vf,Yeah but Spectre was a bad movie,q3nxx2
hfz2v9g,"In fairness, the Mormon holy book is literally called the Book of Mormon. I think that’s what Bond was referring to, not the musical.",q3nxx2
hfx5hav,Spending time to go see musicals sounds very nice to see in retirement. He has good taste in them.,q3nxx2
hgg9m06,[deleted],q3nxx2
hftwlqu,Lol same here,q3nxx2
hfzogf6,I had the exact same thought when they said that line!,q3nxx2

hg2k9n9,Daniel Craig in that suit and Ana De Armas in that dress walking out into the streets of Cuba is peak Hollywood.,q3nxx2
hg2muxd,It felt like a scene straight out of Archer and I was all for it.,q3nxx2
hgerung,That entire Cuba sequence from the moment Bond meets Paloma to the moment Paloma tells him to “stay longer next time” is just…cinema perfection. A perfect 10 minutes in IMAX.,q3nxx2

hft9zce,I got some Atomic Blonde vibes from the staircase scene,q3nxx2
hftrz2g,Fantastic tracking shot! We usually get one really long sequence each movie and it was well done (a la Spectre’s opening scene),q3nxx2
hg277nb,"Staircase scene was Fukunaga showing off, amazing sequence.",q3nxx2
hftdgoa,That stair scene rocked.,q3nxx2
hfual4d,"Knew that the guy who gave us that iconic True Detective single take scene, would have to give us another similarly badass scene. Wasn't disappointed, I was on the edge of my seat.",q3nxx2
hfy235l,I honestly didn't like the staircase scene.  It didn't feel very Bond-like.  I think Fukunaga is a talented director but his style didn't work as well with that spy thriller/action tpe world of Bond as well as I had hoped.  He's better with more grounded action.,q3nxx2
hg2scdj,Omg Jame Bond vs John Wick in a dual???,q3nxx2
hfyf3wf,"The movie was like a 3 hour love letter to Steven Spielberg

First the Jurassic Park sequence, where the car engines are revving like dinosaurs and ~~Nedry~~ Bond uses a winch from a stuck car

Then the whole Indiana Jones sub pen sequence",q3nxx2
hg0811e,"Yea something about the IP rights, but the developers of the Hitman games are currently working on a Bond game. I personally prefer FPS games but a third person Bond game similar to the Hitman franchise could be cool too.",q3nxx2

hg2n2ix,Eva Green has been 30 for roughly 20 years,q3nxx2
hg6xi3c,That was pretty unbelievable to me. She was supposed to be some high-level agent for the British Treasury...at only 23 years old?,q3nxx2
hg6n4cr,It’s weird they made her born in 1983 when Green was born in 1980. Why make that choice for a mere three years? I don’t remember if she says her age in CR.,q3nxx2
hg2rwgh,I always thought she was like 35,q3nxx2
hhutcgb,I was like how is a 23 year old given a treasurers job.,q3nxx2
hkkx48d,"Yeah that was bizarre… no one gets to that level of authority by 23. Besides, Eva Green wasn’t even 23 in the movie!!",q3nxx2
hgbd84g,she was born in 1980 so,q3nxx2
hnaka7v,"Yeah that suprised me, I was 12 in 2006 and now I feel like 23 year olds are young age...",q3nxx2
hftbzcq,"I wasn't a fan of his performance, but even if I was Malek seems weirdly miscast for this timeline. Safin could be younger than you think in the opening (he doesn't ""sound"" like a teenager when he speaks, though), but Malek just ""reads"" as much younger than 40, so the whole thing plays odd.",q3nxx2
hfy2q11,"I figured he was early 20's in the beginning, so being early 40's was plausible to me.",q3nxx2
hga8pcu,These are the correct ages. No need to dig any further,q3nxx2
hgjr8oy,Holy shit!!,q3nxx2
hg669im,There was a very brief moment where we can see Blofeld's file on a monitor amongst the dead Spectre members. He was born in 1946.,q3nxx2

hfy5r5a,"To be fair, covid was already infecting people in China in December of 2019.  It’s possible the movie was altered before March, when the US hit lockdown.",q3nxx2
hg0icww,As far as I can tell it was all ADR lines. Definitely the case during the exposition dump scene in Q's lab.,q3nxx2
hg1ssvw,It was all ADR when they say nano bots.,q3nxx2

hg3e3e1,"The changes WOULD have been too much, which is why they didn't do them. They just said nanobots like 3 times and then pretended the rest of the movie still made sense. You don't grow nanobots in special water farms.",q3nxx2
hg1mudo,"Totally agree. Like, why all the virologists and not a single roboticist to create all this bleeding edge technology?",q3nxx2
hfuwy6t,Honestly I think with a few dialogue reshoots you could define the mechanism of it very simply. They only mention nanobots like 3 or 4 times in the whole film. The rest of the time it’s referred to by its name.,q3nxx2
hfxqjy3,But it _wasn't_ a simple re-work. They just said nano-bots a lot and didn't do anything to change any of the poison / virology footage they show.,q3nxx2
hg07amc,"Good catch.

Not an alcoholic. IIRC, he was just *thirsty*.",q3nxx2
hg11wjk,"See, it definitely felt too important to never come up again.",q3nxx2

hg025kh,"I said it elsewhere but Lynch was by far the biggest disappointment of the film. Ames and Seydoux both had much better action sequences, comedy scenes and dramatic scenes in my honest opinion.

Lynch didn't do anything special this movie and her entire character could've been replaced by Ames which would've made the story better imo. Her entire plot centred on her replacing 007 which she didn't in any scenario",q3nxx2

hkle9vd,"I thought that too, but then again I always felt Felix Leiter’s portrayal was very over the top - like his character had his own character. In Casino Royale he comes off as very much like he’s speaking straight book dialogue:

>“I should have introduced myself, seeing as we're related. I'm Felix Leiter, your brother from Langley.”

A good callback, too - he refers to them as related, and himself as a brother, but over the next few movies they come to rely on one another and Bond  think him his brother.",q3nxx2

As for the older ones you gotta check out Dr. No just to see where everything started. Goldfinger is one of the best older ones and it introduces the DB5. On Her Majesty’s Secret Service is my favorite older Bond despite it being the one and only appearance of Lazenby.",q3nxx2

""However, later books in the series suggest that Bond still has feelings for Vesper.

In Diamonds Are Forever, Bond skips the song ""La Vie En Rose"" in Tiffany Case's hotel room ""because it has memories for him""; this is a song closely associated with Vesper in Casino Royale. In the novel Goldfinger, when Bond has been poisoned and believes he is about to enter heaven, he worries about how to introduce Tilly Masterton, who he believes has died along with him, to Vesper.""

Ideally, Bond starts in WWII and you think England and history is going to play out in our timeline, but the Nazis actually win. And Bond somehow gets frozen at the end of the war. Only to be revived by MI-6 just as the Nazi regime is about to completely finish their global conquest. Opens up a whole steam punk retro 1950s vibe in the future but with Q technology. Would love to explore what was happening to Russia post-Nazi win. People that choose survival over what’s right, French resistance, underground intelligence, double agents.

Oh, and jeez: I wonder if McQuarrie is going to do something REALLY FRESH with the next one and have the team be disavowed as they chase a McGuffin after a major guest star is killed. 

Yep, really fresh.

Yawn.

""No Time To Die"" has made a joke of the ""Mission: Impossible"" series. Then only element that is ""impossible"" in these films is just how banal they all are.

The ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is headed by a sexless lead with a perpetually frozen smile who has these weirdly asexual, coy relationships with his leading ladies.

Paramount has never had a clue what they want to do with Hunt ever since Cruise blew up his persona 15 years ago. That's why he's this enuch stunt man having these CHASTE relationships with 30-something Euro actresses.

The earnest posturing between Cruise and them is so empty and facile. He just doesn't click with his leading ladies. This is something that critics are afraid to admit, but it's true.

Enough with the glorification of this asshole.

Has the MCU really just conditioned audiences like you to sexlessness in our mainstream entertainment? It's like watching something from the pre-New Wave of Hollywood cinema?

Is this want ""the audience"" really wants? These films demand nothing from you, but they don't exactly give you anything, either.

It might give you pleasure to watch a constipated, ageing enuch perform the same old, same old stunts over and over again, but I actually want more.

What people respond to in Craig's performance. He is to spy films what RDJ is to the MCU: he brings a genuine swagger to the genre. He inhabits the cocksure charm and broken humanity of the character. There is both cruelty and compassion in his characterisation. It's a point of key difference between the two franchises. He's not an android appropriating human responses, like Cruise. Allowing the character to evolve and grow is merely a natural extension of our prior investment in the series.

You can't do likewise in the ""Mission: Impossible"" films because audiences would wince if the uncanny valley of movie stars ever tried to do anything more.

What works about the films is the performance of Rebecca Ferguson. She brings a dignity lacking in Cruise's performance. He signs, he stares and he looks like Tom Cruise as he strains not to move too many facial muscles (or maybe he just can't anymore). She creates a character.",q3nxx2

*The name is Bond. James ""I totally give up when faced with adversity"" Bond.*

It was just so stupid. And not just him, M and Q and everyone else involved. Well, shucks, these things are in the body forever, no possible way we could ever come up with a solution!

Bond could have found somewhere safe to survive the bombing, M has a shipping container dropped down on the island, Bond gets in and is taken to quarantine without ever making contact with anyone. There is even a nice super secure underground cell recently vacated by the previous occupant he could have! Or I'm sure MI6 has plenty of options for swankier accommodations that could work as well. And scientists work on a cure...doesn't Safin even mention having an ""antidote"" at one point? Can't remember for sure. But M should have people working on that anyway, should have had that being worked on in tandem with developing it just in case shit ever did hit the fan.

Also, hitting the place with missiles seems super stupid. Missiles aren't likely to destroy 100% of the nanobots and bombing the place will likely just result in some of them being spread to the outside world by way of the air and ocean. Can they survive in seawater? Can they infest fish that could soon be caught by humans? Who knows, but why the fuck would you risk it?? Keep the base sealed and stop the ships heading toward the island, which are virtually certain to not be Russian or Japanese ships because why the fuck would they go along with that craziness and even if they were what the fuck are they gonna do?

He did say he was playing God, but why? Just for funzeez? He said people wanted oblivion, to be controlled, and to die randomly but it feels like his 'why' is still missing. Why him, how did he come to that conclusion, and how is he picking whose DNA to kill (and not kill the entire world). His scene with James as I remember it was mostly just them comparing each other, and not so much focused on the why.

I got the impression he might have been a bit Thanos about it, just wanting to thin out the population and thin out the weak. But they didn't want to be too much like Thanos, and his reasoning must have been something biological.

No, the woke part was that, instead of a diverse world in which everyone could happily coexist together, the subtext of the entire movie was that straight white men have had their time, are stupid and outdated, and there's nothing left to do but for them to be replaced and die. Not even subtext, text in that a black woman not only joins the team but literally replaces him while he makes stupid choices and goes off to live a sad lonely life for five years, after which he comes back to see that he's been replaced and is convinced himself in the end that his best contribution left is to kill himself. This from the character who is, normally, practically the archetype of not giving up.

It's the choice to opt for reverse racism or sexism instead of promoting and celebrating diversity that's the wokeness. Why couldn't Bond and the new 007 have found ways to work together and genuinely both benefit from that? Why couldn't we have explored Bond as a husband and a father; the moments we got of that were great! Why is this a replacement instead of joining the team and all being better for it? And seeing possibilities for that to continue?

That bullshit, compounded with Bond being so monumentally stupid, meant the whole thing just sucked. The life he led in this was stupid, sad, and pathetic. Turning James Bond (particularly this Bond, who had finally moved on from the rampant sexism) into that to make a point is the wokeness.",q3nxx2

Casino > QoS > NTTD > Skyfall > SPECTRE

SPECTRE was so campy and ridiculous it felt like someone had squeaked out an old Roger Moore script for it. The need to make the bad guy be Blofeld was just ridiculous, as was the whole ""The entire organization is out to get ONE MAN"" idea.

It did two things I hate: 1. Tried to conceal who the bad guy was just like Star Trek: Into Darkness and 2. Had it in the script that a major software release is going to happen in the middle of the night from a completely empty building ala Terminator Genisys.

I liked QoS because of the way it continued where the last one ended, which was something most Bond movies didn't do before it.

I think you're conveniently overlooking the fact that Casino Royale was praised for moving away from all the ridiculousness of the Bronsan era and having a ""relatively"" grounded tone. For me personally that was the most interesting part of the movie. No Time To Die I did enjoy, but only in the way anyone could enjoy a 200+ million blockbuster these days. By flipping your brain off. Again I'm not saying Casino Royale wasn't goofy at  times but No Time To Die is one of those ""have fun"" movies whereas Casino Royale wasn't afraid to get very dark and uncomfortable (see torture scene). I don't agree with your post in response to the comment above because clearly the dudes man gripe is that this movie was made for a different audience than Casino Royale was by a large margin.

*Even on the cusp of recasting, it’s rare to get any finality from a Bond movie; producers like to leave the door open, in hopes that they’ll lure their star back for one more round of martinis. No Time To Die is different. It’s been conceived as a proper send-off to Daniel Craig, taking his fifth and final spin in the tuxedo, and as an attempt to wrap up this serialized stretch of a series that’s been running since the early ’60s. Unfortunately, the film is so concerned with valediction that it ends up treating the actual pleasures of Bond—the stuff that’s kept audiences coming back for six decades—like an afterthought.

hxtr8bp,"I don’t have an issue with them giving the role of 007 to somebody else. In universe it makes perfect sense - James Bond will eventually retire, and they’ll need to fill the role with somebody else who is not him. We know that it’s just a title, Bond was awarded it in the beginning of Casino Royale, he can lose it after he retires. That they gave it to a black woman in this film is irrelevant to whatever happens going forward, although I agree it’s symbolic that she was 007. The film was about Bond being forced out of retirement and confronting a world that has tried to move past him (but can’t). it’s more meaningful that the agent he’s working with is his successor as 007, than say 009 or something.

Moreover, don’t forget that in the film, *Nomi requests to M that Bond takes the 007 designation back*. She wanted him to have it while they were working together. The film and its characters hit us over the head multiple times with appreciation that Bond was the true, original 007.

I think people are terrified that they’re going to make the character of James Bond a black woman, but so far there’s no evidence of that going to happen. Nomi is her own character, she is not James Bond. If they recast somebody as Bond, it’s probably not going to be Lashana Lynch since it’ll be too confusing to audiences who were just introduced to her as a separate character. If they try and spin-off Nomi as the new 007 for all future films, I’m pretty convinced that it won’t take by audiences. Any film in the series that doesn’t feature James Bond will never be treated as anything more than a spin-off. The character of Bond is just as critical to the branding of the franchise as the 007 designation, maybe even more so.

I’m also 99% sure that whoever takes the Bond role next will be a man. Maybe not a white man, but a man nonetheless. This franchise’s primary target audience is young and middle aged men, and the execs know that this audience won’t turn out for a female lead character.",q3nxx2

This movie he finally finds that peace and then has it cruelly taken from him in the most disgusting way, and the villain wasn't so personal with Bond to where it made sense to do something that inherently cruel.  It was just unnecessary and killed off Bond while dangling his happy, cathartic sunset directly in front of him as he dies.

They retconned it further by tying Silva to Spectre as well and it was all part of Blofield’s plans. Yet, it was obvious that Skyfall was a stand alone film. 

No Time to Die was terrible too. The nanobots thing made no sense when the scientists seem to be virus/ biology types considering their references to Ebola and smallpox.

She said she got 3 weeks training, but clearly shows superior fighting and shooting skills and she knows how to 'work a room'. You know what she does suck at?

I'm convinced that her three weeks of training were all focused on high-life and upper class society.

Her entire character almost seems to be reading from crib notes on how to be a romanticized spy. She's not clueless, she's not inept, she's just something of a fish out of water yet still very confident in her skills. Like I don't think she ever voices something like reservation, fear, or uncertainty. She doesn't mind expressing confusion or that she doesn't know something, then adapts. She almost gives off the impression that she feels her job is fun.",q3nxx2

Q might have been able to find a way to remove the nanobots from Bond's body, but if Bond leaves the island then he is introducing this chance of instant, incurable death into the world, that might eventually reach Matilda. 

And if the nanobots did reach her, she would be dead pretty much instantly. Its not like there is an incubation period were they could try stop the nanobots once they reached her. 

There was quite a few week plot points/plot holes in the movie, but IMO his choice to stay on the island wasnt one of them.

hg2vr0n,"Agreed. Their relationship was one of the worst parts of Spectre to me. The opening of this movie was enough to hook me to get invested in them, but the rest of the film completely sold me on their relationship. Of course now I wish the beginning of their arc together started stronger and that makes me dislike Spectre even more, but I think NTTD already pulled off the impossible considering it had to start from garbage.

I don’t even see the fact that she doesn’t measure up to Vesper as a downside. People often have much crazier more passionate relationships with some of their first loves compared to those they eventually get married to or settle down long term with. With Craig’s aging character, the fact that he went all in with Swann (and still pushed her away due to his own distrust for 5 years) felt completely believable. This movie made it clear that despite his many defenses, deep down Bond has regret that he never got a real chance to settle down and find happiness through finding and raising a real family.",q3nxx2
hg8wt5i,"Right, what I'm saying is that Madeleine's flashback would have been better placed later in the film, and the opening wouldn't feel so odd if we got to see what Bond is up to. I didn't specifically say we want to see action, just that we want to open on Bond--it is, after all, a Bond film. Open on his retirement and wheel us right into the graveyard sequence. 

Her flashback would have fit better when Safin comes back. Have him show up and say his vague dialogue about a life for a life, and then give us the flashback but do it differently. We don't need 10 minutes about her mother being an abusive drug addict; for a character we've barely gotten to know, it's extraneous information and muddies the script. Cut out that bit and jump right into Safin breaking in. Show him come into the house, give us a brief glimpse of the missing gun under the sink, show him killing mom, and keep the rest the same. As he saves her, linger on the mask, and then come back to present day and have her sitting with the open box with the mask in it. We could even have a classic fade from his masked face to the mask sitting in the box in her lap to tie it together. 

It improves the beginning significantly without giving him away, it preserves some questions about ""her secret,"" and we wouldn't forget about her childhood home in the 2 hours between the flashback and the house showing up later in the film. It also trims out 10 minutes of unnecessary exposition that adds very little to the film. Knowing her mother was an addict doesn't do much for us, nor does knowing her father had a safe room in his house (I mean, why wouldn't he?). Half of that flashback are extra distractions among an already clunky pacing, and serving them up as the follow-on to the gunbarrel sequence is jarring.",q3nxx2
hg8ybl0,"There's one that looks very close to Auric Goldfinger and someone earlier in the thread had identified Baron Samedi as well. It could be coincidence, but considering the way deepfaking has been used in films in recent years, I wouldn't be surprised at all if they sacrificed some CGI budget to toss villains into the background for eagle-eyed fans who were picking out all the callbacks. Remember, the theme of the film is letting go, and the callbacks (and Bond's death) symbolize Eon saying ""hey, this is number 25, we're starting from scratch after this one."" It's not just the end of Craig's run, it's them putting away all the gadgets and characters of previous films to start fresh with the new Bond later on. The series has always teased the fourth wall and at one point outright broken it (""This never happened to the other fellow""), and this is them putting those in the toy box and throwing away the key. 

It course-corrects for the impending question that comes with a new Bond: where does he fit in within the timeline of films? It makes sense for them to add some of the most beloved villains to the background for that.",q3nxx2

hfwtjey,"For me personally it's the forest fighting. It's visually distinctive and the elements of that scene/shot - namely the fog, the relative quiet, etc...- serve an emotional and narrative purpose. Or to put another way, the choices that the director and the DP made in that forest hunt scene tell us something about the character/story/world/stakes/etc... It accentuates the fear the characters are feeling, that sense of disorientation, of being hunted and of being desperate. That's a visual choice that is in service to the story.


Contrast that with the one shot stairwell. What does the fact that the stairwell scene was done as a one-shot tell us about the story/character/world/stakes? And what does it tell us that the action sequences immediately before and after don't. The choice being made there is let's do it because we can and that puts the story in service to the visual.



And maybe if this was 2013 or 2015 or heck even 2018, a one-shot would be a display of bravura and skill worth including just because it's cool as fuck. But it's 2021, we've all seen one-shot action scenes for years now, even Netflix tv shows do it. So if the visual doesn't help the story and isn't innovative, then why put it in? 


It's like I said, doing 'the most directing' has become automatically viewed as good directing, and imo that's a regrettable trend.

hkl0p15,"The writing for Blofeld as Bond's brother made as much sense as the Hammond character in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom or others like that. It was very stupid how Blofeld was his secret nemesis, which is made even dumber considering the fact Eon Productions has owned SPECTRE for some time before I believe Skyfall came out, given they got the rights to Never Say Never Again. Barbara Broccoli simply put lipstick on a pig and pretended it was progressive.  Both the rando and Noomi could be cut from this film and it wouldn't affect anything since their part is relatively minimal if anything. 


And the whole him having a loved one and a daughter was just stupid. Why did she move back into the same house she was orphaned if safety was a concern? And how was that not sold off already? When a dumbass that works with the main villain for his ""therapy"" and doesn't get the fuck out of dodge away from her old life, acts surprised that said past villain enters back in? That's horrid writing. If this Bond Girl is supposed to be specially experienced, why is she far less competent than Vesper Lind or a random civilian picked off the street? 


If they had any guts, they would've had the main villain kill her daughter on-screen just to break her, reasoning it as how male lions kill the other male lion's offspring to maintain control. Actually make him feel like a sociopathic exemption to the rule. And to actually drive home the fact the end simply justifies the means. To prove a point he can make anyone suffer for his own reasoning. He doesn't have some looming goal of domination, but burn everything to ashes through nuclear war.


Or just ditch them the rando and the daughter to streamline the story. All that wasted time should've been used for Noomi.",q3nxx2

That's like Safin being played by, like, Paul Rudd or someone instead of Malek and you just linking me two pictures, one from 2021 and one from the movie Mean Girls, and saying ""see he doesn't look that different in real life.""   


The character of Safin should be at least 20 years older than Swann in the present day. If they put the effort to explain in Spectre in those scenes with her and Bond and her/Bond/Blofeld that someone came to Madeline's house to kill Mr. White and her dad kept a gun under the cabinet next to the bleach and that's why she hated guns yadda yadda yadda, then it should have BEEN Blofeld and not a completely new character. Blofeld even says ""I remember that day."" or something to that effect which I've taken since seeing that movie he was the one who attacked her house. It just seems like they didn't think the age gap through. I was hoping maybe they would have written in a line saying the poison that disfigured him had one positive side effect, his appearance would look a bit younger than normal, but nothing. It just literally makes no sense from a writing standpoint. and saying an actor doesn't look that much older 17 years apart isn't a good excuse for it. I'd buy it if Lea Seydoux had been a teenage Madeline or something in the opening, but 12 years old? Nah.",q3nxx2

Failure to do so feels like a disservice to me because of the endowment I have from watching the entire collection so many times, the games everything… As well it seems disrespectful to the body of work as a whole.There is not even a chance he will even stay ‘dead’.

Like Blofeld at least should not have just been killed off screen. That was the most boring way to kill someone off, especially someone as important of a character as him.

I'm here for an espionage, spy, action movie with a womanizing chauvanist at the center of it all, but not what i got.  Boring main Bond girl.  Silly notions of a tiny woman dual wielding guns, and beating up grown men, trained in combat while Bond struggles with one guy 🙄, then the irrelevant 007 gal that added absolutely nothing to the plot and could have been fully written out, changing nothing.

Watch the mission Impossible saga on how to implement a spy's girlfriend/wife and other supporting female action leads into the plot, make it make sense, make it exciting, and reserved emotional weight

Action sequences in NTTD are being praised, but i find them generic with nothing mind blowing throughout the movie.  Cinematography was decent compared to masterful stuff from before with Skyfall and Spectre being the best looking Bond movies yet.  

Zimmer was at his laziest with this score.  Like almost copying himself from older movies smh.

I mean, Daniel Craig isn't Roger Moore, and he isn't Ralph Fiennes for that matter (I think Ralph Fiennes NOW would make a KILLER fucking James Bond; he's massive in this movie, he's that good with this nothing of a part, in my opinion), and I just thought Ralph Fiennes fit the part of secret agent more than craig in this movie, and that's not a knock on the actors, but probably the production or the producers of the film, and just the fact that i think theyre playing it safe in that way... like, i speculate Daniel Craig has hairplugs, no big deal, he's an a list actor who's a fine dramatic actor too, and even if he wasn't, i believe in his choice and his right to anyway

but theyre giving him a haircut as if he were a Scot or something, or if he were 20 years old, he's fuckin 50, cut that shit tight around his ears

and lastly, the drinking has to do with my criticism of the art design in this movie: where is the blood? drink all you want, it's obvious to me Craig's bond drinks more for than just some recreation, which is fuckin awesome, but youre telling me the script or the production cant show him in like alcoholic rage killing somebody? he's a 00 right, i mean gtfoh (with some of the stuff they did in this movie)

I kept wondering if Mathilde was actually Bond's daughter or not. Aka Safin's insurance policy/viral samples on his necklace would kill off Madeline then Mathilde by relation, but then NOT Bond because the twist was that Saffin expected Bond to be the father when he wasn't.

hkbsn3f,"It's really hard to come to the conclusion that they *weren't* trying to kill Bond. Even after the explosion - which would have already accomplished what they wanted - they came after him, tried to run him over and shot at him a dozen times. What is the suggestion here? That the henchmen were told to only make it *look* like they were trying to kill him? And they were then improvising a perfect theatrical sequence of events in real time, synchronizing everything they all did flawlessly to whatever fancy move Bond pulled? Despite the completely chaotic situation, personal danger and the random nature of bullet fire? Come on. And on top of that, as I mentioned, it's not like he should or would ever think that she betrayed him in the first place. What a hilarious farce it would have been if it turned out that he didn't believe Madeleine betrayed him at all and he just had to deal with this party of clowns pretending they are trying to kill him, eh? Absolutely comical.

Really, whichever way you cut it, the events make very little sense. He should definitely been killed by the initial explosion, that's number one. You can't show him getting hit by a shower of rocks flying faster than the speed of sound and then be like, yeah, they didn't mean to kill him, so that's why he is fine. That's a problem with how the scene looks, but the logic of it is similarly flawed. The effects of explosions are very unpredictable so when you detonate an explosive, there is no telling what it's gonna do. The Bond might have been fine (not at that distance, but let's pretend) - or a rock might have gone through his head and he would've been dead on the spot. Or he could have been heavily injured and unable to do anything other than pass out. In any case, though, why was there a henchmen team ready to go? If they did want to kill him, they would have killed him with the explosion and no team would be necessary. If they didn't want to kill him, why send the henchmen after him to kill him? And how convenient is it that Bond gets to fight a henchman, in the exact specific way that would make time for the henchman to reveal that Madeleine is the ""daughter of Spectre""? That's what in the film industry jargon is called ""shitty writing"". All the people and events are there because the *author* knows what's gonna happen, so he puts them there to have the scenes he wants. But looking at it from the character's point of view, it's: what, why and what the fuck.

I appreciate that making Bond fit the modern era is not easy. And what I am suggesting really, is that maybe it's time to abandon the series and spend the money on something that has a higher chance of being good. That said, there are definitely ways to do better and worse. I thought that Casino Royal - which incidentally is my favorite of the Daniel Craig films - had a lot of the ideas right. They did away with almost all the gadgets, the setting was a lot more grounded and the villain was someone you could possibly imagine existing in the real world. Keeping the stakes smaller would just work a lot better in the modern digital era; you introduce shit like the Spectre and you've basically cut off all the ways that don't lead to ridiculousness. As for the idea of Bond as the masculine ideal - they can change that when the human nature changes.

Lastly, concerning your other comment about Bond being much more skilled, enduring pain, etc - people generally have the wrong idea about how that works. You put two people with guns into an empty building corridor and it's gonna be 50/50 as to who wins. More likely than not, depending on how close they are, both get shot - because, like you said, when people get shot they don't get immediately incapacitated but can continue fighting for several more seconds, minutes, maybe even hours if they get immediate help. You put a super duper special forces guy on one end and a normal soldier on the other, maybe the odds go to 60/40 or 70/30, but that's it. Anyone can point and shoot in a straight line, you know. The real way the special forces guys are better is at planning and moving so they don't ever find themselves in those 50/50 situations, but instead they are always engaging you from a better position, so their odds are 80/20 or 90/10. And then on top of that, when you look at how special operations are conducted, it's a *team effort* and 90% of the success is in planning. You throw a single special forces guy into some hostile building or complex that he's never been in and he's gonna get slaughtered in no time. The only way you can realistically do anything is by having an extremely competent team that works together to always get in those advantageous positions where you are *heavily* favored in a gun fight - and all that is pretty much accomplished before that fight happens by having a plan for every contingency. When you get people killed, it's almost always because something unexpected happened that you didn't count on, rather than some of your guys having ""a bad aim day"". As for people being able to endure pain, sure, but the severity of what would happen to you after getting shot three times seems *rather underplayed*. I can buy that with an adrenaline rush he could overpower Safin and then *maybe* drag himself to the control room to re-open the silo doors, but that's it. There would be no climbing a ladder just to have a nice view, no long, heartfelt conversations where you sound just a little bit tired. Getting shot that many times you would be in so much pain and shock. Fractured bones, blood loss, internal organs failing, you would be fucked. Even so, I don't really have that big of a problem with that one scene, it's more the general feel that Bond is invincible and me not ever feeling worried about him, which doesn't exactly help with immersion.",q3nxx2

hgerdp6,I want a whole movie with a new 007 teaming up with Paloma. Or even just a Paloma solo movie. Just…give me more of that character!,q3nxx2
hg3u0pu,Mostly because they spent four films building up Spectre only to have someone no one knows or cares about kill them all Deus ex Machina with nano-bots.,q3nxx2
hjmdv6l,Agreed character was weak but acting was on point. Malek was definitely creepy in all his scenes.,q3nxx2
hikmc7b,Was Christoph Waltz not as available this time around or something? It really did feel like the Malek character had a lot of big speeches etc that would’ve worked for him and his death was a touch underwhelming as well,q3nxx2
hge9yfe,Yeah that part wasn’t a big deal for me. My thing was why he wanted Madeline so bad. He didn’t want her sexually or as a father figure type. He just spared her life in the beginning and now he’s obsessed?,q3nxx2
hgbb1em,"I was under the impression he was a controlling creep and felt like he ""owned"" Madeline since he had saved her as a kid.",q3nxx2

hfty6cg,"I think he was. Not every villain has to be in the movie as much as the Joker in The Dark Knight. Especially not in a Bond one. There’s only so many scenes we can have of them waxing poetic.

I think it's very obvious that it was a virus because we never see a person say the word nanobot the whole film. It's always over the ear piece or they're showing computer screens. Second, why would a building full of scientists studying viruses have nanobots? They wouldn't. That's a whole different level of engineering.",q3nxx2

hg6ox9e,"I never got The Dark Knight comparison personally. Dark Knight is one of my favorite films and all the comparisons I’ve seen between that and Skyfall are very surface level imo. To take an example you mentioned about something happening in a Chinese skyscraper, the context and subject of those scenes in both films is completely different. I’ve also heard people mention Silva escaping is a Dark Knight rip-off, but Dark Knight isn’t the first film to have a villain escape from a prison. Those things just don’t bother me.",q3nxx2

can't win sometimes",q3nxx2
hh330hm,It would have been very well received if they didn't just straight up lie about his character when the fans figured it out in the first preview. Spectre is pretty trash overall but Waltz as Blofeld only got hate because the production team lied time and time again that he wasn't Blofeld simply because they suck at hiding obvious reveals.,q3nxx2

hg7cac8,"Man a lot of good points here. I was ready to respond to OP with my interpretation walking out of the theater, which is that Rami is a Thanos-like monomaniac who is entirely indifferent to the consequences of his actions beyond his personal battles, even when the scale of the side effects is world-historic.

But you’re absolutely right that his motivations as depicted in the text are all over the place. They really play up the serial killer fake family stuff and then he just kinda… lets them go. Especially the kid, I’m sure I’m missing something but that scene where he just lets her walk off? Seemed like a post-production rewrite or something",q3nxx2
hhcf0c1,"I really didn't understand his obsession with Swan. It should have been the main motive for him, with this being such a personal Bond ending.",q3nxx2

hgfwnyh,"> Having to go on living without being with his family.

Wouldn't work though. All he had to do was shake hands with a stranger, and eventually the nanos could spread and leap a million more hands before finally finding Madeleine and their daughter, and then suddenly they die.",q3nxx2
hgbg7rl,"I would have preferred a happier ending personally.  I don’t always need one, but I think Craig’s Bond deserved something better.  I didn’t love The Dark Knight Rises but I did like how they concluded it with Bruce going to live his life.",q3nxx2
hi2n1v5,"I think more of the latter. He acted those scenes very well but the overall build of his character was pretty bad. 

I feel like this could’ve been a 4 hour movie with how much I feel like could’ve been left on the table. Deep dive into the villain please. Show me real motive and drive. The closest we got was Bond saying “did your mom not protect you” or whatever it was.",q3nxx2

hgfy607,"> Yea and did they explain why his face looked the way it did? Or why he acted so strangely?

The scars were from however he survived whatever it was White did to his family. He acted strangely because he was a young boy when his entire extended family was killed in front of him.

He was more fleshed out than practically every other Bond villain except for Silva.",q3nxx2
hgpiv8h,I assumed he survived Madeline with body armour. He did come prepared to face Mr White,q3nxx2
hituqvs,"They said his appearance was from dioxin poisoning, which disgusted him but killed his whole family",q3nxx2
hgwdg0d,I think calling it collateral damage is wrong. It's intentional to target entire family lines to really dig deep and make sure you rid the world of whatevers being targeted.,q3nxx2
hi2nc4d,"Also the program wasn’t ready to ship. They stole a beta product because they didn’t care about the collateral damage that existed (or actually wanted that “feature”)

I’m sure M wouldn’t ever have used Heracles unless they could contain it to one person and one person only",q3nxx2

I definitely missed this part!",q3nxx2
hhlhzlu,That dress fit her so so well,q3nxx2
hg0qbjv,"oh ok, now that makes more sense. I think because the Blofeld eye ball is taken off screen, it's not as clear to the audience that is the one Q has, since he seems to be accessing Primo's vision from it.",q3nxx2
hg21fqd,"So he has an artificial eye with a radio transmitter, and he just gets to keep it for five years in MI6 prison, lol",q3nxx2
hg8l0j0,"As someone who hasn't seen the movie, this is just wild.",q3nxx2
hfy1oj7,"I would love to see a decade spanning Bond saga.  Start with the 60's, then a sequel in the 70's, 80's and 90's with homages to those era Bond films.  It could 100% work with today's effects.",q3nxx2
hftt0h5,"I would LOVE it if they ditched the modern setting to go back to Cold War era spy shenanigans.  It lends itself _so much better_ to the genre.  I also am pretty sure they'll be casting Richard Madden, or otherwise another (in my opinion) boring option as Bond, so setting it back in the 60s or even 70s is a good enough excuse to keep Bond male and white.",q3nxx2

'Man called UNCLE' showed it can work.",q3nxx2

hg0h8no,"Yeah, if you notice during the exposition dump scene where the nanobots are explained, anytime a character says nanobots or anything specific to them being technological in nature, they are offscreen and their voice is dubbed in. All the images of nanobots are shown on screens that are taking up the whole shot and could easily be done in post. Other than the moving swarms of nanobots in the factory lab area (which could also be done in post) there's practically nothing that couldn't be interpreted as applying to a virus or other bioweapon. And as you say it makes way more sense with the garden - and what the hell were all those people doing knee deep in the pools in the lair if these things are nanobots?",q3nxx2

So he was speaking incoherently enough for it to be dismissed, but coherently enough for Cyclops to understand that the plan was to:

* break into an insanely secret lab to steal a super classified weapon

* organize a birthday party in Cuba, inviting all members of Spectre with ear pieces to be able to hear Blofeld

* expect JB to show up and to make him the centrepiece for an extravagant and dramatic final kill in celebration of Blofeld

This means some time between when Blofeld had his face blown up, and the events of this film, he was given a fake, electronic eye, that had a microphone and assumedly speaker plus remote viewing that allowed him to orchestrate stuff from prison.",q3nxx2

hfyclxv,I liked the movie but damn is this another movie with a great actor cast as the villain that seems totally wasted.  Le Chiffre and Silva were great villains played by great actors.  So it seems the issue with the villain in Spectre and No Time To Die is a writing issue and not an actor issue.  But Rami and Christoph acted very well but you can only do so much when the writers don't give you quality.,q3nxx2

I thought there were some weak points in the plot, it felt a bit overwrought, but the action sequences were quite good. Malek took me out of it a bit though.

hg6zccx,"Considering the nanobots still acted like a virus...I'm not sure why they thought the audience would feel better pretending it wasn't like one? They created plot holes for no reason, and I think it somehow led to the villain's motivation becoming somewhat convoluted.",q3nxx2
hfv76eq,"It's not that they don't say nanobots specifically, it's just how it works in the movie wouldn't make sense as a virus. How it is transmitted via skin contact and can't be gotten rid of makes absolutely no sense as a virus.

It really drives home how risky and tragic it can be for a secret agent to fall in love.

Same idea in *No Time to Die*, but it was a family instead of just a woman, an adorable little daughter that he'll never get to know or spend time with because of his dangerous job. It may be a bit hokey and sentimental, but I couldn't care less. I ate it up.

Experiment with the art design, direction, music - genuinely have fun with the idea of what Bond can look & feel like. Keep doing single film installments with new Bonds, and eventually get back to a single chronology.

I feel like in the era of serialized movie making, where the biggest franchises are putting out a film a year at minimum - doing something like this would be the best way to make Bond feel like a unique event picture. The worst parts of Spectre & No Time To Die are the attempts to build a continuous narrative between these adventures - just embrace the episodic nature of it all.",q3nxx2

Casino Royale came out before I entered high-school. I am finishing up my PhD right now. For a solid... 20 minutes of this movie to be essentially devoted to the happenings of a movie from more than 15 years ago is a bit weird.

To give a video game analogy, Ellie's plot from TLoU 2 can be thought to be very similar to Bond AND Safin's plot from NTTD - these are all tales of vengeance and trauma. However, at the point of being done with TLoU, we have spent close to 10-15 hours with Joel and Ellie. JB's and Vesper's connection lasted maybe... 60 minutes tops, 15 years ago, in terms of screen time.

There has to be a good reason this type of storytelling is usually reserved for TV series, rather than movies. A good revenge/trauma plot usually needs to unfold over 1 movie as a self-contained experience. Off the top of my head, all the good movies about revenge I've seen are 1 movie: The Revenant, Unforgiven, John Wick etc. If revenge/trauma is to be the key point of your work of art, make sure that's well fleshed out.",q3nxx2

The previously mentioned theory about the EMP destroying the nanobots is plausible enough and I am disappointed in the seeming termination of the series. I grew up watching the classic Bonds with dad and the Brosnan era. It has been great to have the Craig series be cohesive and building upon each other!

She’s trying to let go of her fear of being hunted down (represented by the memory of Safin). Remember that in Spectre she’s been hiding away her whole life to avoid people trying to get to her, and she tells Bond when walking up the steps that he shouldn’t have to look over his shoulder anymore. She’s obviously projecting a little since she’s still afraid of people coming after her, too. 

In a nutshell, the pre-title is all about Swan and Bond having to let go of their past in order to have a healthy future together. Unfortunately Blofeld ruins that and, as Bond is convinced she betrayed him, she pleads with him and says she has something to tell him. Bond assumes it’s that she’s a Spectre agent but we later learn that she was pregnant. 

Blofeld later tells Bond that she is keeping a secret from him. Since Blofeld doesn’t know about Safin, and he’s just revealed that she had no part in the attack in Italy, he’s definitely referring to Madeline’s daughter as the secret. Blofeld says “it’ll be the death of you” not that it will kill him to find out. What Blofeld meant is that when Bond finds out he abandoned not only Madeline but also his daughter, all because of a lie, he’d be really regretful: it would “kill him.” But Blofeld is more right than he knows, and this is later a key piece of foreshadowing.",q3nxx2

*The end of Spectre. For which the continuation was to happen in No Time to Die, which again last 5 minutes. I feel like your analysis is summed up as ""easily satisfied"", where if they just throw out characters and point it out to you ""this is his daughter"" that's good enough. They barely have to interact with each other. I feel like this is how we end up with unfleshed out characters in the end like Safin and even Blofield.

To emphasize the point, at the end of the movie, Madeline doesn't even call James ""Daddy""  and instead calls him Bond when she retells his stories to Mathilde (even this name is forgettable). She's very loosely connected to him as his daughter.",q3nxx2

htc3ovo,"I don't know what the trope is called specifically, but that movie had a bad case of Bond being basically invincible to bullets (or all henchmen-style villains were jobbing hard) until the main villain was the one holding the gun. Bond took out like 50 people in the last scene and while he got beat up a bit, he never got shot. (I literally remember him walking down the main poison hallway with no cover while like 30 soldiers with rifles couldn't hit him. That is of course until the main villain miraculously shoots him twice to incapacitate him right when the plot calls for it. Also... if we are going to talk about plot holes, I still don't understand why the two random ass ships approaching the factory meant there was no choice but to blow the factory up.

But seriously... Blofeild apparetly had this bionic eye from the time he got caught, at the end of specter and then wore this super advanced robot eye in prison for five fucking years (with no battery) and never put through a metal dector.

Some of us are late to the party and like to post-watch read in detail! Especially when they're annoyed or confused. That it was closer to 3 hours than 2 and most people didn't understand what the villain wanted or why is surely the most significant achievement the movie could have hoped for. I've never heard of anything like it!

I don't know, it feels like 2 movies merged into one and what I liked was almost entirely separate to the movie as a whole. I enjoyed it a lot while watching because the cinematography and cast were so good, but then it ends and you're like... wait a minute, that didn't make any sense! And the more you think the worse it gets.

The only thing I've not seen mentioned in my reddit trawl is something I read in a review elsewhere, that the section with Paloma should have been with Felix instead to give some weight to what happened later. Her section is so short and isolated you have to wonder if that was the original intent. As much as it would pain me to lose the best part of the movie, they're totally right. Felix didn't get much more than an extended cameo as it stands, not too brotherly.",q3nxx2

I guess it’s more my interpretation though. 

With the mosquitos, I had forgotten about the friends part so I guess maybe that goes back to the annoying and pesky thing. I’m not sure what the child would’ve known to make that comparison. Maybe the mosquitos are meant to be evil and it’s asking if the villian, or bad guys had friends? The mosquito transmits disease and death, killing like the many assassins in the film.

hfy36m5,"so after thinking about it for a while, I came to some thoughts on Safin's motivation:

- After falling victim to the Spectre practice of murdering a member and their entire family, Safin wanted to repay that to the organization. He wanted to kill every member of the org and their entire families.

- Since Swan is Mr. White's daughter, he wanted to kill her. Since he survived his family's wipe out, he decided to extend that curtesy to Swan (unclear if this is true or not, I'm just trying to figure out why he didn't kill her in the beginning).

- By the 3rd Act, Safin's motivation is about preservation. His only family is now the legacy of poison growing they left behind. The poison that is the basis for the Hercules project is what's left of the legacy and so he will do whatever he can to preserve that, even if that means threatening the world.

- I think in order to assemble of pretty large continent of scientists, workers, and goons to follow him, Safin sold the idea that they would take over as the new Spectre and threaten global powers and be rich. Maybe for the Russian scientist they appealed to his casual racism.",q3nxx2

hgny5ui,The big thing for me is that Bond coulda just lived. Like he gives up because of the whole nanobot shit instead of just like... isolating for a while while Q comes up with a solution? Could literally also just replace all of the blood in his body as a quick solution. Like we've followed these people for years and they're supposed to all be the smartest there is at what they each individually do and then the writing just falls off a cliff in the final act to conveniently have Bond die. It was awful.,q3nxx2
hgpe4wy,No… female 007’s  exact line was “he’s going to kill millions”… which given the added context from all the other scenes in the movie means he’s going to kill millions of powerful and important people but not the entire population. Just finished watching it an hour ago.,q3nxx2
hgp22qy,"He's not killing everyone, He's killing all the agencies around the world.

Thats not basically  everyone but it is a very weak motive and a very weak villain evil lair plotline. Build up spectre for 4 movies just to have it wiped out in seconds.",q3nxx2
hgorx3n,Yeah they previously used it to target Spectre...and they have lists of governments of every world...and they have enough DNA to target specific ethinic groups or nationalities...or they could probably set it to standard DNA and kill indiscriminately (which definitely is not the plan).

Yeah, those people were probably his next targets. I think Safin was targeting world leaders next from what I remember of his monologue. As for the buyers, it appears Safin was mass-producing the nanobots so he could sell them for money. It's a typical Bond villain thing. In *The Man with the Golden Gun*, Scaramanga wanted to sell the Solex agitator to the highest bidder.

hg5awgd,"Blofeld said something about clearing the board, something to the effect of (and this won't be direct) ""emptying [Bond's] world"" because Bond needs a villain to chase or he doesn't have a purpose. I guarantee he orchestrated his own death at Bond's hand. He knows Bond better than Bond or MI6 do, as demonstrated multiple times in both films. He saw an opportunity with Madeleine, he knew Bond would use her to speak to him in person, and he knew that she wouldn't go through with what Safin asked--he knew Bond would try to stop her by grabbing her wrist, so he had Safin deliver Heracles in a perfume. Wham, bam, Bond kills Blofeld, loses confidence in himself, has an empty world, and it deludes MI6's confidence in him. It successfully erodes Bond's whole world and isn't outside the realm of Blofeld's chess expertise--he had the whole MI6 building rigged to blow with traps and little moments of exposition set up throughout before Bond got there, so is it really so hard to believe he could orchestrate his own death?

Anyway, the mass manufactured weapon/virus/nanobots in the lab were one thing, but the single dose of virus set to only target Madeleine was a separate thing that Bond got injected with. By the time Safin smashed it into his face it was too late, it’s already in Bond’s system and he couldn’t ever get it out. If he escaped it would spread from person to person until it eventually reached Madeleine and her daughter, even if Bond never touched them himself again.",q3nxx2

The first ever Bond novel is about him falling in love, before being betrayed. And the final Fleming novels published in his lifetime tell the story of Bond falling in love again, getting married, his wife getting killed and Bond seeking revenge for his wife's death.  
Falling in love, while uncommon for Bond, has been part of the characters dna since he was first created.  


Even in the films we've had him fall in love and get married before (OHMSS) and done the love and betrayal storyline with the reboot and Casino Royale. For Craig's final films it does make some sense that they would do their own spin on the later Fleming novels.",q3nxx2

Her interaction with him prior to that didn't seem like a first meeting, and why would she open *his* ""memory box"" unless she expected it to mean something to her?

Adding to this interpretation is that that later at her house she has the map of his island and (I think) a photo of him too, right? And didn't she say that's the past she intended to reveal to Bond (after he opened up about Veper)? I don't perfectly remember everything about that conversation but I felt it was consistent with ""she knew him well"". Also it seemed like he already had her hair in order to get her DNA prior to her kidnapping. (Although that could have been done secretly.)

On the other hand, Bond met her through her father so they obviously hadn't lost touch either.  We really don't know what those missing years were like.

It could be that Blofeld meant her pregnancy instead, although it seems far less likely that he knew about that. Or maybe he was just bluffing since he enjoyed driving them apart. Vague foreshadowing of doom doesn't mean much to me in a Bond movie. ;)",q3nxx2

Goldfinger, Goldeneye, For Your Eyes Only, License to Kill, Skyfall, Casino Royale, Live and Let Die, From Russia with Love 

NTTD in particular ties in with Casino Royale and On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. 

Connery is the iconic original Bond and all his are worth watching. Roger Moore was kinda goofy but he was my personal favorite. Brosnan, again, was debonair as FUCK. Dalton and Lazenby are both underrated.",q3nxx2

So they decided to do a ""bond retires"" story but had someone else as 007 because that's how the in-universe logic works. But you sure clutched those pearls hard when that person turned out to be a black lady, didn't ya?

A comic book movie, or like…any of the Bond movies from the previous generations? Fair enough, though, not grounded.

His endgame was to take over / control the world by being able to tidily target and eliminate anyone he thought should be eliminated, in bulk and potentially without collateral damage. He had a god complex and when talking to Bond on the island he was practically getting off on the idea that people had no idea he was their god, burrowing under their skin and about to be in control of their life or death. M and Bond also discuss Safin’s plans at the river and basically agree that anything he COULD do with the weapon would likely result in “the usual” chaos and collapse of order and democracy, which was enough to justify finding Safin and destroying the weapon.

Ethnic cleansing of millions was a potential means to Safin’s end, which was mentioned explicitly by MI6 when first discussing the weapon’s capabilities and by the scientist talking about wiping out the whole black race right before Nomi kills him.

* Dominic Greene is a shitty villain. Nothing remarkable about him, he doesn't seem like a Bond-level villain (his evil plan is to double the price of water in Bolivia is not only low level for a Bond, but IRL the price of water in Bolivia was TRIPLED right around the same time) and the final fight between him and Bond is so hilariously anticlimatic and overmatched that it makes the final moments of Spectre look like Saving Private Ryan.

But in the books, Spectre isn't aware of who Bond is until after the events of Thunderball, and even then Blofeld doesn't recognize him until the climax of OHMSS, after Bond has already impersonated a genealogist and infiltrated their operations.

I guess my beef is the whole direction with Spectre (the movie) and how Blofeld knew Bond and basically planned everything to hurt him. It just was a very weak execution of the story, where personally I would've liked if they didn't have the half-brother plot line, and Bond had to infiltrate the organization for a while and actually get to interact with Blofeld as a spy and not as a victim of a jealous sibling.",q3nxx2

It’s not even that far fetched, we have nanobots today that can literally help sperm fertilize an egg.

Cliche supervillain stuff is kinda Bond’s bread and butter, it’s in 90% of the previous Bond films before Craig’s. This one was by far the most sci fi technology out of all his films but it was cool to have it done in his final film as a throwback to the older ones.",q3nxx2

Well… I suppose ‘James Bond’ could be a kind of code name that any agent could adopt. But that’s kinda dumb. Up to this point the movies have implied we have been watching the same agent not different agents under the same name.

It doesn't have that ""Bond feel"" your talking about because its not suppose to, its a different body of work. From my perspective my generation of Bond was the Golden eye era and i never enjoyed those films. What Daniel Craig and this team has done was make it a more serious and a much less gimmicky spy film that I guess is what your alluding to as the old ""Bond"" feel. Craig has single handley got me back in to this mediocre franchise and made it a modern more realistic take on spy/wargames with a dark feel to it which is what this generation calls for. Dont get me wrong my favorite Bond before Craig was Connery I enjoyed Goldfinger, Thunder ball, from Russia with love my favorite Bond movie of the old era but I enjoyed it for what it was, it has no place in this time.Those films absolutely have not aged well imo this series has.So sorry its not about you and your old nostalgic feels or mine.. Its a new generation, a new feel, people are growing up watching these Bond movies with Craig as you did and that's what is important that the franchise moves on with the times and continues to have fans. I doubt any 12 year old will enjoy watching octopussy today but I am sure they would gravitate towards this era bond much more.

The gunbarrel sequence is already off (no center or corner wipe, no blood) and it sort of impotently fades in. Alright, fine, we don't get a wipe from the center of the barrel, whatever. What's Bond up to? We always get to see that after the barrel sequence.

Oh, this isn't Bond. This is a flashback? And it's to the childhood of Mr. White's daughter? 

And then we sort of unceremoniously get thrown into present day Italy?

The first scene doesn't fit, and the transition from the gunbarrel sequence doesn't fit with the rest of symmetry they tried to build with previous entries. It throws the whole film off-balance from the jump. 

It would have been better if they saved that flashback scene for when she sees Safin again later. Cut down the bit about her mother being an addict, it adds nothing to her character or the context. Show him breaking in, a quick shot of the gun missing from under the sink, him shooting mom, and then keep the rest of the scene the same. Saves us 8 awkward minutes of unnecessary exposition, saves Safin as a surprise for later, and then after the flashback cut back to him handing her the box and opening it to find the mask. All the threads come back together the same way, it's more impactful, it fixes the beginning and the shitty gunbarrel, it keeps the plot point about ""her secret"" a little more vague, and you haven't forgotten about her childhood home when it shows back up 2 hours into the film.

But aside from Craig's Bond, the rest of the movies are at least the same Bond (or two) 

Just quoting this reply I saw online here: [https://qr.ae/pGD2pi](https://qr.ae/pGD2pi)

""Here is some of the evidence for this.  
As James Bond (George Lazenby) is packing up his office while attempting to resign in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969), he ponders momentos he has collected from his adventures from previous films (in which Sean Connery played Bond).  
Sean Connery returned to the role of James Bond in Diamonds Are Forever (1971), and that film opens up with Bond searching for Ernst Stavro Blofeld for having killed Bond’s wife, Tracy, at the end of On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (in which George Lazenby played Bond).  


Roger Moore played Bond for the fifth time in For Your Eyes Only (1981), and that films opens with Bond visiting the grave of his deceased wife, Tracy, who as I pointed out above, was killed in the George Lazenby Bond film On Her Majesty’s Secret Service.  


Clearly Connery, Lazenby, and Moore were all playing the same person, not different people with the same name.  
It should also be noted that not only has the actor who played Bond changed throughout the series, but so also did the actors who played these characters:""

M also refers to Brosman's bond as a ""relic of the Cold War"" in Goldeneye even though he's pretty young in that movie.",q3nxx2
hib1p3i,"They've said Casino Royale was a reboot of the series and the Craig Bond was its own timeline. Aside from like Judy Dench being cast as M.

Casino Royale is Bond at the start of getting his 00 status and then each of his movies are intertwined with characters and Spectre, then it ends with No Time to Die",q3nxx2
hiavy90,"I think the hint was in the hallway with all the photos of previous ""M""s  - they can't just get old and die and he lives forever. The writing was figuratively on the wall.",q3nxx2

his2lzg,so? once in 60 years and you think they’re gonna not have more down the road ?,q3nxx2
hjjw0kx,[deleted],q3nxx2
hisjy6b,"Yes, and I wish they hadn't done that.  But the end of the credits even said that ""James Bond will return.""  So they clearly are not planning to retire the character.  Who knows what they will do.  Realistically, any type of reboot is probably going to involve someone younger than what Daniel Craig was for this movie.  So if people want to pretend that anything that comes in the future with James Bond in it is a story from before he died, then I guess that's one way to approach it.

I would just think of it as a new iteration of the same man and those other adventures didn't happen to him.  That doesn't mean I think James Bond is just a name that has been taken by different men over the decades either.  I think of it similarly to what I think when we have a different person playing Batman.  Christian Bale's Batman never fought Jack Nicholson's Joker, but that doesn't mean that I think Michael Keaton and Christian Bale are just two different men who were known by the name Bruce Wayne and became Batman.  They both were the one and only Bruce Wayne and Batman.  It's just an unfortunate side effect of these long running franchises that no single actor can do it indefinitely before they either age out or lose interest in playing the role.  

I don't like that there's an iteration of James Bond now who has died.  But if they reboot and tell us ""This is James Bond now and here are his adventures,"" I'm not going to try and somehow fit the death we saw in this movie into that new iteration's past or future.",q3nxx2

Also, the fact that he didn’t bang Ana de Armas or Nomi was actually incredibly refreshing and felt really earned as part of Craig Bond’s character development.

As for the wife kid and death, I don’t even need to explain how all of that fits into Craig’s Bond character arc organically. Would it fit other Bond films? Absolutely not. This one? Absolutely yes.",q3nxx2

hkd6t8d,"Hm, you make some excellent points, my friend.  There's not a whole lot I can refute there.  The only thing I might be able to contribute is that during the car chase scene, when all the baddies are firing on the car, its possible that they would have been pre-warned that the car is bulletproof.  That would be in line with Spectre's knowledge, and when the one dude was trying to puncture the glass by firing repeatedly, it seemed like the goal was to kill Madeleine there, probably just in an effort to cause further pain to Bond.  I could totally see them killing one of their own operatives just to hurt Bond, considering the intimate nature of their relationship.

Beyond that, I'm not well-versed enough in combat and tactics and strategy to refute much else of what you say, and the arguments you make are well stated and seem compelling.  Luckily for me, I have a really easy time with suspension of disbelief, so seeing things that may seem unrealistic doesn't break my immersion very easily.  It may be a form of stupidity, I don't know, but it does make it easier for me to enjoy movies where a lot of people would not.  So in the end, I did really enjoy NTTD, and while having bad writing does make me knock some points off, I still enjoyed the action and I do also kind of get off on the idea of characters being so insanely skilled and disciplined as to be basically untouchable.  I can definitely understand why this would detract from a lot of movies for a lot of people though.  

Personally, I'm pretty curious about the future of Bond and how they'll shift the narrative to suit the modern world in future installments.  I don't think the franchise is at the point that its just a dried out husk, there's still a good amount of potential there, but I will say the next movies are going to have to do some things differently to really stand above what came before.

First is my default option which is not trying to make sense of the continuity. It’s all the same character. These are all his experiences. The timeline makes no sense. In the end, none of that really matters because that’s not the sort of franchise James Bond is. He exists as a man out of time whose character and stories reflect the world around him at the time and that’s fine.

If that doesn’t appeal to you, you have the Daniel Craig bookend alternative. Casino Royale was Bond’s first mission. No Time to Die is Bond’s last mission. Everything else, before and after, happens somewhere in between.",q3nxx2

hgacmhi,"The reboot was the whole point of the last scene and all the throwbacks. This was number 25 in the series, and regardless of how different each Bond has been, they always have throwbacks to the previous films...whether that's referencing prior films in exposition, actor cameos, keeping the same actors for their characters when Bond changes actors, walking through a massive underground armory of prior gadgets, or outright turning to the camera and saying ""this never happened to the other fellow."" The question of continuity has loomed over every new Bond's run and they wanted to nip that in the bud this time.

They pull out all the stops for this one. The DB5, the V8 Vantage, villain cameos in the background, portraits of prior M's, reusing old theme songs and lines (""We have all the time in the world"" killed me repeatedly as both the song and the line kept popping up, I felt so much dread), even the fucking Delectado (still pissed he never smoked it).

hk2kw05,"Hey, since I've got your ear I'll keep going.  Those two movies I mentioned are aesthetically the most Kojima, but in terms of a thematic influence to Kojima, On Her Majesty's Secret Service is a really important movie.  Make no doubt about it, Kojima has seen all 26 Bond movies (I also count Never Say Never Again), and there is a lot of crossover between Kojima actors and Bond actors.
Up until they cast Daniel Craig, these movies had no particular lore that tied one movie to the next, so they developed their own weird meta narrative about who James Bond is - there are competing fan theories, but the main overlap is that we don't know who this guy is or where he came from, because they keep ret-conning it a thousand times.  Besides switching actors for the protagonist, they also switch the actors for M and Blofield over and over and give them different backstories, and there are also the original novels, which are completely different.  If you try and wrap your head around you'll quickly get into a narrative singularity similar to MG.
That's why On Her Majesty's Secret Service is so good.  They decided to develop lore when they switched actors the first time, but they quickly scrapped it for decades worth of movies and occasionally had to hand wave some lore they developed in one of the first 20 movies.  Even when they cast Daniel Craig and decided to do a narrative continuity, they did a weird thing where Judi Dench still played M for three movies, so they couldn't quite commit to a ""real"" narrative.  And now James Bond is dead, dead dead dead.  Except, like a Kojima character, he's really not - he just comes back as ""some other guy"".  Anyways, If you like Kojima, I encourage you to watch all 25 movies.  I would start with On Her Magesty's Secret Service and if you dig it give Moonraker a shot - Moonraker is an awful movie, but it's famously (at the time) one of the most expensive movies ever made and it's influence on anime/games can't be understated.",q3nxx2

It certainly didn't feel like it was breaking new ground but it's a pretty slick looking movie with well executed action set pieces and hot people in great outfits. I'm sure it's very middle of the road for the franchise as a whole but it was a nice breath of fresh air that felt distinct from the average Disney blockbuster of the last 10 years for me.

I’d bet that that exact scene (where they discover the “factory” above the “farm”) is exactly where they would’ve guessed his intentions.

I wish they’d kept that plot element in rather than cut it. It’d be controversial but edgy in a good way. Even Bond calling Safin the latest in a long line of angry little men comes off weird without that context, presuming it was supposed to be there originally.

His biggest moment was when he did choose to die, in order to allow his daughter and the women he ultimativly choose to love to live in a good world, without him. They could'nt live in a good world with him present - as he would not only endanger them with enemies that would come their way, but also with his presence - a man who needs to 'play', who cannot give up his personal revenge, and who always will be a killer.

As for the ships, neither MI6 nor Bond wanted ANYTHING about Heracles leaked to the rest of the world-let alone people infected with the nanites. The CIA and MI6 practically came to blows over Heracles and global knowledge of a DNA keyed nanite superweapon would ignite a nightmarish arms race at the very least.  Bond himself wanted to die with the complex due to a combination of seeing the job done, protecting his family from his nanite infection, and also ending his life: he doesn't seem very interested in living in a world where he can't even be in the same hemisphere as the only person he loves-let alone one where he's patient zero of an epidemic that would specifically target her and her daughter.

""I don't agree with your post in response to the comment above because clearly the dudes man gripe is that this movie was made for a different audience than Casino Royale was by a large margin."" There you have it. I was highlighting the gritty tone of Casino Royale because it was in the same series as bond films as NTTD. I'm not sure why you're talking about Bronsan films or the eariler eras because I never once said James Bond films aren't or shouldn't be wacky. My problem is Craig's era bond films start off grity, are praised for it, and then turn into evil guy trying to kill millions with nanobots. This is all within the same universe. As I said before, Casino Royale is clearly made for a different audience than NTTD. The latter being a much more accessible film.",q3nxx2

hgjjk7k,"The Craig movies very explicitly ignored all previous movies. But there was a slight degree of continuity in the pre-Craig movies. For example, George Lazenby's Bond got married in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, only for his wife to be murdered by Blofeld at the end of the movie. Then, in Diamond's Are Forever, Sean Connery's Bond gets revenge on Blofeld for killing her. Both Pierce Brosnan's Bond and Roger Moore's Bond have references to him being widowed. There's also a variety of other references to previous movies scattered throughout the franchise here and there, but its never that important.

So the first twenty movies can all be reconciled into being roughly in the same continuity if you compress the timeline a bit and pretend that Brosnan's Bond had all of the Connery/Lazenby/Moore adventures at some point in the 80's instead of the 60's and 70's.

Ironically Mr White (the guy Bond was hunting in the previous movies) would also have been killed by it if he hadn't died already because he shares Matilda/Madeline's DNA.

They never were too specific about how it spreads tho. Bond touching Madeline's arm was enough for him to contract the nanobots that killed Bofeld, but he was directly touching the chemical spray area. It could be airborne and everyone that breathes the same air as Bond could catch the nanobots, or it could be based on touch. But who knows how long the nanobots would survive on a surface?

Say Bond survives and moves to Alaska for complete isolation. The act of Bond opening a door at the airport could spread it exponentially. A passenger touches that door, then that passenger shakes the pilots hand, or brushes against a stewardess. Then that Pilot/Stewardess fly to the UK, infecting everyone on the flight, with all the passengers then infecting others in the airport. Then spreading further to every flight leaving that airport. That's what makes it so scary.

Its not like COVID where people have symptoms and know they are infected, or can just wash their hands more frequently to stop the spread.

Spectre wasn't really long and boring like Pierce Bronson said because if he paid attention it tied everything together and to be honest I felt like it should've been the last one. Fucking loved Dave Batista in that movie. And Bond finally got the girl.

Cubby, Barbara’s dad, wanted a white male who is English and nobody else and landed on a Scot who still is the benchmark for Bond and then an Australian who lied his way through into getting the job even if it is for one movie.

But to me, chronology is fine to suspend disbelief on, but you can't come back with what happened in this film. When  it's rebooted, the character must be someone else (for the first time). Remakes are fine (*Casino Royale*) but this would be the hardest of hard reboots. It's like if Disney came out with a movie called *Bambi*, and there was a deer living happily in the woods and her and her mom hang out and have a good time the whole movie. And among all the works of fiction, it's hard to pick a better franchise that can easily handle the events of this movie - they already addressed it!

And I'm not just talking about emotional/psychological damage. 

Usually, strong villains kill characters that were beloved and/or very close to the main character. Usually, they permanently change something in the protagonist's life. With the latest Bond villains and the villains in superhero movies and other blockbusters, it's just like ""oh, hey, I'm the new big bad guy. Look how scary I look.

Hmm. Are they though? I get what you’re saying, but I think there are more parallels. Silva wants to show Bond that his faith (in M, in MI6) is misguided. The Joker wants to show Batman that his faith (in Harvey, in Gotham) is misguided. Both of them try to turn the main character through a series of trials and disappointments. 

Also, it isn’t just Silva getting captured, it’s him knowing they’d hack his laptop, knowing they’d put him in the impervious cell, knowing there was an escape route, knowing when the train was coming to kill Bond, etc. None of that works without anything before it happening.

I think lots of movies took from TDK, and early Craig’s Bond took from the Bourne movies. NTTD even has more sophisticated choreography in the gun-oriented action scenes, I suspect due to John Wick’s influence.

Actually, name a great movie and I can give a cliche it uses for the main character.  Cliches are unavoidable.  Everything that works on an individual level has been done.  Bond sacrificing himself, however, is completely new to the franchise AND entirely fitting for his character.  

Also. Sure, the ultimate sacrifice part is cliche, but the way it’s done is not at all.

Spectre killed him and and wanted to repurpose it to target specific individuals but never got far before Mi6 stepped in and took it, intending the same purpose.

That's my thinking anyway on the original script. Now that's obviously a guess but it's supported by a couple of things in the movie, it also would raise more interesting questions about the parallels between Spectre and MI6, and also would be neat since it means while obviously the big villain Blofeld would have effectively stopped a genocidal mad man in Saffins father.",q3nxx2

So how do you explain that the Craig-Bond, which would please Fleming, is the most successful of all?",q3nxx2
hgk4txj,">at the rate these movies are currently coming out

Amazon paid $8.5 *billion* for Bond (twice what it was worth), so if you think it will take anything like 5 years you might be high.

Eon knew in 2016 that Craig wasn't coming back for any amount of money after MGM reportedly offered **$*****100M*** for him to do NTTD plus a 2nd film. It was written in stone when he went on Colbert in 2017 to officially announce it. So it's beyond obvious that they have been working out what their next storyline introducing a new Bond for the last 4-5 years. They probably already have the script finished and are lining up the director.

If you were a friend suggesting 4-5 years, I would bet you $100 on the spot that  the new Bond will be  announced by next spring, production on Bond 26 will start in the summer and ""Eon Production & Amazon Studios present Ian Flemming's James Bond in...."" will be on screens sometime in 2023....",q3nxx2

In the end, he dies an unknown (notice no state funeral even) and the only thing that exists is a folk story. If I guess THAT is the ending people wanted to the Bond saga, I just think it cheapens the journey of such a complex man spanning over 50 years and countless movies.

Bond also doesn't want that technology to exist either.

The nanobot rewrites annoys me more than the Spectre retcon but that could change in time. Blofeld and Safrin are both equally lame.

He's had YEARS to set this part up. 
-Eliminate Bond's drive (villains to fight) by killing off SPECTRE. Check.
-Use Madeleine to turn Bond into the vector for Heracles and force Bond to unwittingly kill Blofeld himself, a line he would never actually cross and would absolutely fuck him up. Check.

1) The eyeball was quite a large electronic device... I imagine there were a capacitor or two in that eyeball which would definitely make a mess when exploded! :D

Whereas the nanobots are quite small so should not have 'exploded' quite as much, although maybe if they are damaged that could also kill Bond? (Like if the nanobots are damaged the genetic code gets misread and just kills any genetic code etc). Also the fact the nanobots are on Bond's skin so if they did explode it would be superficial at worst.

I just think they’re best off creating a new continuity for each Bond (if they want to make them as connected as the Craig films) than trying to expand upon the Craig series continuity (which let’s be honest, was sort of a mess after Spectre).

Like in Cuba what the fuck does she even do? Ends up behind a pillar and then...what? She was just stuck there for a few minutes unable to get away with the scientist even though she's a 00 agent? And then loses the scientist. I think they just didn't want Bond babysitting the scientist during the escape so just used her for that.

Then she whines about Bond and the 007 designation - which James seems completely unconcerned about - a bit then turns up following one of the bad guys in Norway...but apparently not very close? Because she certainly is nowhere to be found while he is getting attacked. Perhaps she knew the people after him were completely uselss fuckwits who couldn't kill a sloth and stopped to do some souvenir shopping? Then turns up to pick him up after he's had enough time to make it back to the main road and seemingly walk down it for a bit. But why did he even need to be picked up? Perhaps I missed it but he drove in there with a perfectly fine vehicle that should have just been sitting there after the bad guys got killed/left. Or take the bike of one of the dudes that he killed.

And then she gives him the 007 designation back, flies him to the base, shoots some guys with him, kills the scientist, takes his newfound family and goes and sits on a rock.

You could remove her entirely from the movie and have zero issues. Just a terrible character.

I liked de Armas better too, because at least they realized she was there for no other reason than to try to up tickets sales in Latin American countries and didn't feel the need to keep her around being useless. She popped up, did some shit and was gone. And like you said, was more energetic.

The whole movie felt like they had scenes - island base! Norway forest! snowy isolated house! - and actors to try to appeal to specific demographics before anything was written and then tried to construct enough of a story around that to use all the scenes they had thought up and locations they had decided upon.

hm618jp,Yeah there was a black female 007 but you said in your post you took issue with a non white James Bond. It made sense in the story because James unceremoniously retired so he was replaced and someone else took up the 007 designation. Black Panther is an inherently black story so it wouldn’t make sense to use a white actor. What makes James Bond an inherently white character aside from you being used to seeing a white guy in that role? You might need to brush up on your definition of appropriation before you keep using it.,q3nxx2
hnbqqp6,"Black Panther can be played by a white male. But Black Panther is a character from Wakanda. The person becoming Black Panther has to be from Wakanda. Same way Bond has to be British. Last I checked there ae only black people in Wakanda. If you see a white person who lives in Wakanda feel free to make them black panther.

If James Bond dies, you should be interpreting what that means. If he's his 007 status is replaced by another character, then someone's earned that. Just because you don't know anything doesn't mean it is lazy or poor writing.

hkddoet,"Hm, that's interesting, because I personally believe we sort of passed a period in the early 2000s where all sorts of shlock was pushed out, whether it be a cash grab or something clearly born and bred to win Oscar's.  Nowadays it seems like there's been a realization that better quality content makes more money, so more money is spent on better ideas and better scripts.  Now this isn't universally true, obviously.  Bad movies still come out, but it seems that we are getting more original ideas or fresh takes on old ones,  I might just be talking out my ass or totally misremembering my childhood, but I would swear up and down I'm saying more and more these days that 'hm, I've never seen that before.'  Maybe I'm just more selective in what I watch or more inexperienced in film than I realize, or maybe I'm just foolishly optimistic.  

I mean Netflix content alone has produced some of the best movies I've seen in a while, which is an impressive jump in quality from when they started out.  The best thing might be these stories that are coming out, mostly in TV format and especially on Netflix, that are planned out from beginning to end, so as to be one full self-contained story, not forced to drag on way past its due date cause it's still making money.  The Queens Gambit is a good example of this.  

As for Bond, I'm willing to hold out hope that they'll come up with a fresh take that maintains the spirit of Bond.  Time will only tell.  I'd like to say I'm making a conscious decision to not get too invested in anything that I'm too let down when it falls short.  I'm able to maintain low expectations, enjoy the good parts of a film while mostly forgiving its bad parts.  In actuality, this is more something ingrained in me than it is any kind of conscious decision.  So while I'm able to enjoy things more on average across the board, I miss out on getting really hyped up about things and getting that big emotional payoff when it meets or exceeds expectations.  Pros and cons I guess.

There's a middle ground though. If you start with someone too young, it leads to another arc of Bond gaining experience and the like.



Bond should already *be* experienced, already *be* the best. At least the old school individual movie Bond (that I hope they return to).




Connery was 32, Lazenby 40, Dalton 39,  Brosnan 42, Craig 38.




Moore was 46, and by the end looked *very* old.





I see the point of ""a more physical role"" but Brosnan did fine in his 40s, and his roles were pretty physical. Craig was pushing 40 when he started.

Yes the majority of cliches are bad. But its moreso about how its pulled off and to me and others in this thread Bonds death wasnt that satisfying. Its a pretty tired old trope to have the main character die at the end, but BR2049 pulled it off with far more nuance than NTTD did IMO",q3nxx2

""Other movies have cliches"" is a big whataboutism, and as i said in my other post its about how they are pulled off. 

Bond sacrificing himself was actually quite forced and contrived. The villain leaves then just randomly shows back up at the perfect time to catch Bond (where his dozens of trained soldiers couldnt LOL). He just found out he had a kid the day before. He barely even knew her. He hadnt seen Madeline in 5 years but is just desperately in love with her. A lot of it is forced with not mucb set up. Is it poison flowers or nanomachines? 

And yes it absolutely, 100% is a tired old cliche for the hero to make the ultimate sacrifice and die. The only thing that makes it original at all is that other Bonds got to ride into the sunset.

I think a better way to do that would be if the new 007 was a lesbian. I don't know anything about Lashana Lynch's sexuality, but IMO there's no need for an actor and their characters to have the same sexuality- we shouldn't limit an actor like that as long as they can pull off the role.

Now that she's also interested in women, the new 007 could sexually harass women just like James Bond.

*movie explores the actual fallout of a death on another character that was close to the one who died.  New character explores his connection with the old one and finally comes into his own as a man.*

“this movie didn’t make me feel the weight of his death because the creators didn’t just act like it didn’t happen in other movies!”

The real reason is because iron mans death was satisfying and bonds was not.  That’s not bad. Iron man completed his arc and so did bond.  But where tony stark was a character constantly at odds with himself and on borrowed time, understands who he has become and fucking slaps while doing it - well, bond is a character constantly at odds with himself who had all the time in the world.  He was ready to live a new life and because of his own toxicity due to being a killer and getting involved in the situation? he literally got poisoned Into never being able to touch his wife or daughter again.  And he finally met the person where his answer to never being able to touch them again was to die rather than live on.  That’s not satisfying. Remember - tony literally did get to live out his life with a wife and daughter.  Bond did not.  

Tony was tragic but... *right*.  There was a sense of justification there.  Of satisfying his journey.  Bond has that, but his death is not satisfying his journey for a lot of people.  Most people couldn’t give less of a shit about his arc from the last films or his own inner turmoil.  They just wanna see him be happy at the end.  Tony got his fill of being happy and then decided to finish his life off. Bond never got a fill of happy, it feels like, and so there’s no catharsis to his death unless you know this Bonds own personal demons that have been listed in previous films.",q3nxx2

The message, of course, being that belief in oneself is what makes us extraordinary, not some intrinsic state of being.  

Which is the matrix.  It’s also a super cliche message.  But it works because it was done right.  And you literally just talked about K making the ultimate sacrifice for someone else.  

Which is the cliche you’re saying made NTTD bad.

>last minute call to loved ones

Like I said, all plot beats are cliche in one way or another.  *name a good movie and I’ll name all the cliches it follows*.  The actual call that bond makes, which you probably don’t want to admit, is entirely original.  A male character saying a child is the most beautiful thing in the world and admitting that it completely restructured the way he looks at the world is something rarely seen in movies and was absolutely beautiful to watch a man say who started the series off saying “the bitch is dead”.

I think this isn’t about his death being a cliche to you.  Because all plot beats are cliche.  Everything has been done.  I think it’s because it wasn’t cathartic to you, wasn’t satisfying.  You weren’t okay with the fact that bond only died because he’d rather die than not touch the ones he loves.  Which is deeply sad and unsatisfying, but in the context of him turning away from love at every chance he had after the first, is actually a satisfying completion of his arc that is incredibly nuanced.  I repeat - *he decided last minute to die when he realized he would never touch the ones he loved again*.  Name a movie where that’s been done.  

It’s not an ultimate sacrifice.  It’s someone who loves another so much that going without them is worse than death.  That IS unsatisfying. But not unnuanced.  It’s deeply nuanced for a character that turned away love so much because of the betrayal and loss he felt in his first film.  

>wasn’t that satisfying

Okay so I was right.  

Deaths don’t have to be satisfying to be done well or be nuanced.  You can not like that but don’t say it’s poorly made because your own tastes don’t align with a film.

>cliches are bad

Wrong.  Everything is a cliche.   Plots are tools to forward the actual point of storytelling - characters, and character arcs.  Cliches are totally fine as long as they aren’t used as crutches.  As long as the actual meat of the scene isn’t the cliche but rather the characters themselves.  This is why bond AND blade runner works because the characters justify the cliches the films employ.  Cause they’re just tools for the characters.  Avoiding cliches is a stupid choice because if a characters arc warrants a certain beat, that beat should be made - and that’s that.  Cliches are only bad when they’re put there without the character needing or justifying them.  Bond choosing to die over never touching the ones he loves is a full completion of his arc, and thus entirely justified.  

If you want a genuine criticism, the last thirty seconds are actually really poorly done.  There was no time shown of her processing bonds death, which made it feel off.  Furthermore, she tells her daughter “let me tell you his story” and it ends, which is also poorly done because there’s no time between his death and her telling her daughter about her father.  It could have been easily fixed by adding a single line where the daughter asks about where the man that was protecting them went.  THEN she tells her, then it ends.  

There were poorly done aspects of the movie.  His death was not one of them.  Unsatisfying =/= bad.

And no, I don't speak for him, I just look at his statements and draw my conclusions. If you agree he's *closer* to Fleming's idea (and in fact Craig-Bond's still colder than any other Bond, less humorous, and more ""dogged"", I would say), then what are we actually arguing about?

Wrong again. Its the same tired old call to loved ones that its in almost every other movie with this type of cliche. A tender goodbye designed to tug at the heart strings of the viewer. Extremely cliche and done to death. 

>I think this isn’t about his death being a cliche to you. 

Do not strawman or make assumptions about what i think. 

And you're missing a huge plot point. It wasnt just about his ""loved ones"" (daughter he literally just met and ex g/f he hadnt seen in 5 years) it was about not releasing more programmable nanobots into the wild which could end up destroying the human race. 

>Okay so I was right.

You're not right. You're bending over backwards to defend a tired old cliche. Its not that deep. Yes its a bit sad but Bond chose his own death the minute he called Felix to get involved out of his own desire for revenge/blood lust. It aint about his poorly set up loved ones, Bond was gonna die because he chose to get back in the game. The ""loved ones"" are an emotional tool used to tug at your heart strings, a tactic seen a million times before. 

And its not my own tastes, its just not very well executed. I could use your same silly logic to say your tastes are heavily overrating the amount of nuance and its also clear you are here to white knight the film because you liked it.

Bond was definitely not in more pain. He was only shot like twice. Painful, yes, but he was still entirely able to kick a grown man’s ass and save the world at the last second and climb ladders and stuff. If he had a route off the island he probably could have survived. 

Stark was literally immobile with his organs failing and half of his body burned away. He couldn’t breathe or form complete sentences.

I'm actually surprised how vague most theater sites are about the types of IMAX theaters they encompass. It turns out a true 1.43 IMAX laser theater is a bit too far from me (I mean it's not too too far however it's in NYC and I just don't want to deal with the hassle of going into the city). My local IMAX theater is AMC which is the 1.90 format. So basically it's between that or Dolby which as you've said and I agree with, might be better. If the movie was entirely shot with IMAX cameras than I'd 100% go see it in an IMAX theater however since it's just a 1/4 of the movie shot in IMAX, than is it truly worth seeing in IMAX when Dolby offers superior picture quality and sound?? I think it's 1.43 IMAX > Dolby > IMAX 1.90.",q3nxx2

Exactly.  That’s my point, it’s just like the matrix and completely unoriginal as a plot element but still works because the character arc warranted it.  

Just like how in the matrix Neo not only accepts he’s not the one, just like K accepts, but he also only makes his choice to save Morpheus after the oracle tells him it’s either neo or Morpheus who dies.  Only in their acts of free will despite what the system tells them is possible do they sacrifice themselves for people. The exact same arc across its larger beat structure, but different in the details enough that even though it’s unoriginal and cliche, it still works because the characters that warrant that arc are very different from eachother... or are they?  

Maybe it’s just a satisfying story and that’s why you like it.  And maybe NTTD is unsatisfying in it’s ending and that’s why you don’t like it?  And you’re coming up with mental gymnastics reasons to blame the film cause you can’t accept that films can be good and still not mesh with your tastes?  

Because both characters go from normal characters with nothing to say, to disillusionment with their worlds, to being told they’re someone special and believing it, to discovering they arent special, to being given the option of letting someone die, to choosing something that goes against all notion of who they once thought they could be, to doing something truly extraordinary and becoming the thing they were told they couldn’t be because of the care they have for others and because they simply decided to save someone, sacrificing themselves in the process.

The only differences are small variations of length across points in this arc between the films, the only really big variations being K’s disillusionment being much longer - and his belief that he is special, extended to around half the movie instead of fourth of the movie.  

I said I was done and I am, though.  Just think that it’s silly how wildly you’re misinterpreting everything I’ve said and thought I should demonstrate by using the very first sentence you wrote.  I promise I’m not strawmanning; I’ve just made my point very clear and it shouldn’t need further explanation.  I found your first sentence to be the only thing worth responding to.

They put a lot of effort into humanizing and celebrating the Bond character to give him a heart warming sendoff where everybody remembers him fondly.

And from this point on anyone can play the top secret agent of British intelligence.

It’s blowing new life into the formula.
