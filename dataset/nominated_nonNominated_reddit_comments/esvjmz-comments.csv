ffe7evk,I’m such a sucker for the whole “character explains plot and then there is a twist” trope so I was absolutely delighted by the format of this film. Pretty hilarious throughout too. Definitely recommend!,esvjmz

ffecdam,"Really enjoyed this movie.  Nothing groundbreaking, but it feels like it's been forever since Guy Ritchie has genuinely made a film like this that it kinda does serve aa a breath of fresh air.  


Also, probably the best performance I have seen from Charlie Hunnam yet.  SOA wasn't really for me & I can't say I've been impressed with him in any of his film roles up until now.   The scene in the apartment where they're trying to get the rich junkie girl to go home was enough to tell me I've been selling him short.



Overall, I love the characters.  I love the tone.  I love the world.  I wouldn't *hate* a sequel",esvjmz

I literally left the cinema giddy and on cloud 9 because I enjoyed this movie so much 

Charlie Hunnam continues to prove he’s one of the most underrated in Hollywood right now, the scene where he goes to get the lords daughter was brilliant acting on his part with how he controlled the room 


Lost count of how many twists were in this movie but loved every single one and it was the most Guy Ritchiest movie I’ve seen yet from Guy Ritchie and I loved every single second

McConaughey  and Golding almost seemed like they didn't have *too* much to work with; Grant and Hunnam were fantastic, but Farrell stole the show, especially his very last scene.

ffg51z8,"OK so coach is really Ray from In Bruges. We actually never got his real name in The Gentleman if I'm not mistaken.

After laying low for a decade plus Ray returns to London and starts a new life training at risk youth in boxing. he is a former criminal so he knew just what to do when he found out who his boys truly robbed, in seeking the meeting with Raymond. This also explains why he's able to dispatch of the Russian hitmen, he's not new to using guns",esvjmz
ffubsy5,"Late to the party cause I wait for Discount Tuesdays but let’s talk about how Coach saved Ray from the two Russian dudes. He didn’t have to intervene- his debt had been paid. But presumably he felt a sense of kinship/loyalty with Ray that meant he couldn’t just leave him to be ambushed. It’s my favorite scene in the movie. 

It reminds me very much of the end of War Dogs where Bradley Cooper gives Miles Teller some money at the end for his labor and stress, despite not needing to.

ffe5q20,"Michelle Dockery is a fucking badass. She was the best part of every scene she was in and stole the show. I went to see the Downton Abbey movie after never having seen an episode and she did the same then, been obsessed since. She needs to be given juicy, starring roles.

The transition between Phuk falling onto the train tracks and then McConaughey's confused face was brilliant. ""I'm starting to sense a pattern here. Who's this flying fuckboy anyways?"" was hilarious.

Loved that Ritchie let Hunnam really shine, giving him that long, tense-but-comical, standoff-ish scene in the apartment building. Same with Hugh Grant & Colin Ferrell, extremely hammy and funny. You could tell the whole supporting cast had a blast doing this. Ferrell's intro scene in the restaurant was great. Liked the meta-ness of the whole thing, and even then fake-out scenes which I'm not usually a fan of. It didn't take itself too seriously at all which is a nice change of pace.

It's clearly not a deep movie, there's a lot of loose ends and you need to look over a bunch of glaring issues especially with the structure of Michael's drug empire, but it works.

This was actually a lot of fun. 8/10. Some are gonna complain about some dialogue, but like, fuck off, it's a Guy Ritchie gangster movie. 

Lol @ the Harvey Weinstein-looking movie exec in the Miramax offices. Also, my 7:00 PM screening was *fucking packed*, didn't expect that at all.",esvjmz

Best movie i've seen in quarantine with invisible man being a close 2nd",esvjmz
fmfbvqr,"I'd put it below Rocknrolla, Snatch and Lock Stock, but it's a welcome return to form for Ritchie after King Arthur and Aladdin. Though it doesn't quite have the narrative depth or same amount of colorful characters as Rocknrolla. Probably my biggest complaint about the movie, is that I never really felt that the main characters or their organization were ever in any real trouble. It felt like they just had the situation under control and were always a hundred steps ahead of their rivals at every turn. What I appreciated about Rocknrolla, is that there's a real sense of uncertainty and flux within each of the gangs/criminal factions as the plot progresses and they all try to come out on top over each other.

&#x200B;

Comparatively, i didn't really feel like there was much in the way of real consequence for anything that happened in The Gentleman and that diminished the journey a bit on my end.  On the positive end, Collin Farrell and Hugh grant essentially dominated every scene they were in and their characters were easily the highlights of the movie.

&#x200B;

For me the Gentleman would get a solid 7-7.5/10. It does its job well enough, but could have been stronger in some areas. Ritchie has yet to top Snatch & Rocknrolla for me.",esvjmz
ftg6stf,"Tell me if I'm grasping at straws here, but is the Coach, Ray from In Bruges? Did Ray survive and dedicate his life to help all the other young boys he could?

His fighting is similar. The way he talks about racism is similar. And the fact that he takes responsibility for the actions of his boys the same way Ken did for him? And he has experience with a gun, given the ease in which he kills the two Russians at the end.

And the striking similarity to the way he blinded the guy trying to rob him in in Bruges, to the way he blinds the kid in the restaurant.

Someone please convince me I'm wrong, cause the best part of In Bruges was the ending, and not knowing if he Survived.",esvjmz

fswqjur,"Saw it today, cinemas back and running!!

Very Guy Ritchie-esc. British gangsta, predictable, fast-paced and fun. 

I loved: the soundtrack, the tartan tracksuits, Colin Farrel’s character and performance. 

I hated: the Fletcher-character and the concept of telling the story through him. There was lack of flow, no interesting twists and turns, just this annoying dude talking to much. Completely overplayed by Hugh Grant. The movie is lacking from having many of the main characters never interacting, it is obvious the actors were rarely on the same set. Chemistry not there. 

Interesting: some of the footage was nicely done. Using the light in the first scenes in the kitchen was smooth, when Hunnam enters the room and switches the light on it kind of comes together. I liked that detail. 

It annoys me the storyline with the main villain (the jew) never got closure. A pound of flesh in the freezer? And all that waygu beef everywhere, was it just beef? Def not vegan, thats for sure.",esvjmz

1. How did the toddlers know where to find mocked and when he would be there? They didn't even know who he was earlier in the film and it can't be that easy for a bunch of amateur boxers to track down a drug kingpin.
2. At the end, when mickey shows Matthew the video of him and Dry Eye at the football game, there is audio and we can hear Matthew say dry eye will drown. It looks like the same video as fletcher shows Ray earlier on but, at that time, fletcher makes a big deal about not being able to get audio and having to use a lip reader.

I swear Guy Ritchie’s  writing is so lyrical. 

Also i enjoyed the constant delaying gratification, where they’d set up action, cut to a different scene and then revisit the action in a different moment. It was one of the least boring movies I’ve seen in a while. This and Uncut Gems Booth has a similar viewing experience, except instead of dead and stress, I was feeling joy and excitement, but neither felt like I could really recline and rest the whole way through.

Lots of nods and winks to other movies, which I attribute to Fletcher’s description of everything being through a cinematic lens.

Also I just want to say I love the plaid track suits and am considering researching them for my personal procurement down the line.",esvjmz

Thoughts?


Also I'm not exactly sure why the Toddlers would call the coach to brag that they just broke the law in about 10 different ways when he's the one trying to straighten them out. 



Useless side trivia:

Guy Ritchie does make the beer ""English Lore"".

He co-owns the bar 'Lore of the Land"" with David Beckham. The name is seen on the glass along with the pickled egg.

Guy also makes and sells the barbeque pit shown in the movie.  

Bugsy Malone originally told his agent he didn't need to get paid since Snatch was his favorite gangster movie and he loved Guy's work.

fgkb5nk,"Favorite movie of the year!

Jokes aside, I really did love this film. Reminds me of a mixture of Knives Out and Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels but leaves you with a great mystery with an action angle. Loved that Grant was a cinefile and framed the story to make it more action oriented. While the score was sorta kinda generic I don't think it subtracts any points off the film. Along with the snappy edits made this film fly by and how they set it up for a possible but not nessisarily needed sequel feel more welcomed and not groan inducing

 It even didn't bother me that Matthew McConaughey used British slang, which normally would because people who tend to be fluent in the language and move to a different area tend to adapt the accent from time to time, while retaining his accent because he grown accustomed to the culture. 

This film also made me realize and come to accept that Colin Ferrell is one of my favorite actors after years of saying ""I love this film"" and sure enough he's in it with 7 Psychopaths and In Bruges being stand outs with the Lobster being a more subtle example of how excellent he is with delivery and mannerisms with a character.

Overall a personal 10/10",esvjmz

ffr8xa0,"Yes it's very reminiscent of Ritchie's other work, however I think the big thing holding The Gentlemen back is the lack of a good antagonist. Hatchet Harry, Brick Top, and Uri (the Russian from RocknRolla) were all to be feared. We were told they were to be feared. Then we were shown just how terrifying they could be. They said, did, and for the most part got away with some of their horrible plans. The Gentlemen doesn't have this. Is Henry Golding the bad guy? He doesn't really achieve much. Is Hugh Grant the bad guy? He is playing people against each other, but he's not intimidating at all, and none of the characters seem worried about him. Lastly, is it Jeremy Strong? Sure he has a plan that seems to be working initially, until we find out that he wasn't really in control at all and McConaughey and Hunnam were always one step ahead.",esvjmz

Having a civilian character interfere with the mob but admit wrongdoing and then not killing that character is a nice change of pace. So many movies would have just had him get shot right there to show how cold and calculating the boss is but no, Matthew's business just listens to his apology and offer and just says ""Yeah ok, sounds good to us."" Then Colin and his boys become some of the best parts of the movie.

Raymond seemingly knows everything, often without good reason, until it's convenient for the plot for him not to know something, even though he should. They seem pretty slow on the uptake that Matthew set up the burglary, even though it just happens to be at the one site he visited not all that long ago and they never had problems before his visit. Instead they go after Lord George, who has no idea what's going on, seemingly just because the guy who passed on the information about the site was Asian.

Guy Ritchie has shown that he can set up a ""comedies of error"" where due to a series of misunderstandings, people go after the wrong people, but it just doesn't work here. The characters are established to be highly informed, so they shouldn't be making these mistakes.",esvjmz

My only issue is it felt out of touch in a few moments, it goes way too over the top in trying to shit on basically anything ""young"". It felt so weird to me that the movie patronizes and shits on Henry Golding's character for being ambitious in advancing his position, but praises Mickey for ""coming up the hard way"" by taking out those ahead of him. 

Between that, the speech hunnam gives the heroine kids, how dumb they paint Coach's kids, the random hooligans coach gives a beat down to in the deli.... It almost felt like the movie was going out of its way to ""BaCk In My DaY"" the audience at the expense of the actual characters",esvjmz

Except two things

Dryeye becoming a rapist at the end. I get that the point of his downfall was his lack of discipline and respect. But that rapist thing was a little much. I would have preferred that he was getting too smack happy instead, to show that he is too distracted by violence.

And my other thing was Mickey being saved by happenstance at the end. It showed the irredeemable nature of the toddlers and that Mickey was built up the entire time as having connections and being capable and being one step ahead but in the end it’s still just luck. It would have been better if the boys were there in case Raymond didn’t release Coach from the debt. But because he did, the boys jumped to save Mickey instead of kill him. The decision to be kind and charitable and redemptive would have benefitted the outfit. As opposed to just some luck.

ffe5twk,"The first thing I would like to say is that this really isn't a bad movie. I'm probably going to sound harsh but the truth is as passable as this was, oldschool Guy Ritchie was a big deal for me and I'd like nothing more than for him to approach that kind of quality and this simply doesn't. And I think the worst part is that it tries so hard to do so. It's fun enough it might do fine and it's certainly not gonna be on any worst of the year lists, but it felt like chasing the dragon. 

There's some bright spots here. Performances are all really fun you can tell everyone's having a ball. I think Hugh Grant might be in the midst of lowkey being one of the best character actors we have. McConaughey is McConaugheying on all cylinders, Colin Farrel was probably the best and most underused character in the movie. 

It's also just kind of nice to see Ritchie doing something original again. Even if it does feel like a reskin or a greatest hits without the highs of Snatch or Lock Stock or RockNRolla, it's cool to see him back to form and having fun and not doing Aladdin. 

I think the real problems here are with how the story is presented. The story itself isn't bad, I mean it's a little predictable but the characters are fun enough it could be fun to just watch it play out. But there's all this muddling of the narrative. Hugh Grant is telling Son of Anarchy about his screenplay, which is also just a recounting of the events happening in real life involving Hunan's boss, McConaughey. So while I'm trying to figure out why Grant is telling him a story of which he already knows, it's also hard to figure out where Grant is embellishing or making things up. I mean, I think he's called on it whenever he does so the story is probably pretty straightforward, but it's very muddled. 

Between the back and forths in time and character perspective and then dipping back into real time at Hunan's house and then it all syncs up and the story continues in the same fashion, it was just a lot to keep track of and some things were explained a little poorly. I'd kind of like to see it again to try and set it all straight, but it really feels foggy and like it just didn't need the extra layer of Grant selling a screenplay to Hunan. Ritchie has used characters in the story as narrators or 4th wall breakers before so it all felt very in his wheelhouse, but in this particular case it just made things less clear to me instead of more clear.

I think another thing that bothered me was that this movie was just so... clean? Not in language or violence or absurdity, but just the way it looked. Oldschool Ritchie is grimy like the London underground it depicts. Snatch is a dirty feeling movie with lighting and outfits that reflect the darkness of the characters, same with Lock and RockNRolla. I don't mind a different direction, but this all just felt so fresh and clean, like there is a clear difference now that he has studio money and I'm not sure it works if he wants to return to form. 

I would also like to say that I'm honestly not sure how I feel about some of the more absurd moments. On one hand, I'm all for absurdity. Guy Ritchie makes me think of beating someone with a dildo or Boris taking two clips of bullets or feeding someone to a pack of hungry pigs. So when someone is projectile vomitting across a table, or when things almost got really rapey truly out of fucking nowhere towards the end, I just didn't feel like he was nailing his own tone, which I know is a weird thing to say.

Anyways, I didn't hate this movie by any stretch of the imagination. I just think it failed to hit any of the highs of the films of his that I really idolize and that's really what I wanted out of this. I can always watch those movies whenever I want, I was hoping this would be more of a fresh take on his own style or a modernization of it but it really just felt like moments and characters from the past got jumbled around in the wash and lost a bit of color and vibrancy. I'd still give this movie a solid 6/10 and recommend it to anyone interested, but if you wanna see Snatch just watch Snatch.

I wonder if the script was originally written for McConaughey's character to be British but then when he couldn't do the accent decided to change it.

I can't say it is a perfectly tight film, I'm sure there are probably some major plot holes throughout, but the movie moves fast enough that you don't linger on the plot and you just enjoy the ride. It is not high art, but it is a worthy inductee to Guy Richie's crime canon.",esvjmz

fnkqt07,[deleted],esvjmz
ffr773d,"This started off *waaaay* too slow, not counting the initial shooting that's not even shown for obvious reasons. The long, drawn out chitter chatter between Fletcher and Ray really could have been abbreviated I think.

That said, once things got rolling, it was enjoyable. Especially Colin Farrell as that poor coach just trying to do right with his kids. The scene with him and Charlie Hunnam watching the video of the pig-fucking was my favorite moment in the entire film. I would *love* an entire movie of just the coach trying to fix things so his kids don't get killed and falling further and further into allegiance to Mickey. *That* would have been an incredible film. As it was, I would give this maybe 6 out of 10. Almost a 7. It wasn't as thoroughly engaging as Lock, Stock or Snatch, but it had some quality moments.

edit: Also, I think McConaughey was miscast. He was only mildly menacing, mostly just bored looking.

ffhdx49,"I didn't love it. I just thought it was way too talky for a crime caper-type of movie and little of the dialogue resembled natural speech. The whole structure of it is based on this artificial-seeming expository monologue. For a contemporary crime story, nothing about it seemed very real to me. Also, a lot of rather old-school racism, which came off to me as if they were trying hard to not be PC

On the other hand, the acting was generally good. Hugh Grant was probably the standout. McConaughey was good. Charlie Hunnam was good because this role was within his tiny, tiny range. Michelle Dockery was good. Colin Farrell was a bit wasted, not a great character. I can understand why Henry Golding wanted to do something different, but this role was maybe a bit too unflattering for him, with the rapey-ness, bad fake teeth, Asian caricature schtick all over the place.

ffenpnf,"It's the stereotypical Guy Ritchie cockney geezer gangster flick he knocks out in his sleep. I love Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smocking Barrel's. Rock N Rolla isn't quite a patch on those two but gets by cause of the charisma of his cast (when you have Tom Hardy,Idris Elba, Mark Strong, Toby Kebbell in supporting roles, you can't go wrong).

Ritchie has always been very hit and miss, he's done work that I personally have enjoyed (The Man From Uncle and his Sherlock Films) but a lot of crap (Revolver, Aladdin, Swept Away, King Arthur). With The Gentlemen, it dragged here and there but overall I don't it's a 8.1 rated movie that some have it as on IMDB but a solid 7 for me.

I loved Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell (one of the better actors out there for me) in it. Charlie Hunnam is what he is, meh actor. Matthew McConaughey is phoning his performance in, which he has done for while now. The Villains sucked. Didn't like the nod to The Long Good Friday, Ritchie shouldn't be touching a British gangster film that pisses over everything he's done. But overall it passed the time nicely, Grant is great in it. 

If you want to watch the best Ritchie gangster film not made by him go watch Layer Cake by Matthew Vaughan, that film is awesome.",esvjmz

I liked Richie's return to 70s style twisty crime films (those opening credits!). Good idea to use Hugh Grant telling the story to cover any conveniences and plot holes, but that does also weaken it by using such a method. Hugh Grant killed it, and so did Colin Farrell. 

Intereting to see McConaughey take it easy and let them run away with the film. I actually liked Charlie Hunnam for once. 


But I hated Jeremy Strong. His delivery was just awful.

Didn't care for the many of the xenophobic aspects. Fit for the guys themselves in the film but my audience laughed at them as if they were jokes. That could be fault of the audience, but in presenting the same way it erases the line.",esvjmz
ffl4k4w,"Went into this completely blind and last minute after reading a one line synopsis at the theater. I've never watched any of guy Ritchie's other films so I don't have too much to compare it to but I loved this movie.

Is it a critical masterpiece which has layers of unspoken depth and tear-jerking performances about important subject matter? No. But it's really fun and doesn't take itself too seriously, which is rare to see nowadays. The story within the story, calling out when the climax is coming, essentially breaking the 4th wall but not in an overdone way is a breath of fresh air.

Matthew McConaughey is so flawless as Mickey it's as if it was written for him. Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell give this movie life and wouldn't nearly have as much personality without them. Acting was top notch by everyone involved and it felt perfectly casted.

The movie did have a lot of flaws, mainly taking a long time to set up and a lot of moving parts in the beginning part that made it hard to follow. I didn't even realize what he needed 20 million for and why until the second half/ending part of the movie. The Russian thing was kinda random and came out of nowhere with no significant reason compared to the rest of the movie. Still, the strengths vastly outweigh the weaknesses and going in expecting a fun action movie with plot holes and not a complex, clever serious film does well.

Overall it's like a mix between knives out and Kingsman. Fun, light, keeps you engaged, would recommend to watch highly",esvjmz

The rest of the acting ranged from fine to practically intolerable and the screenplay felt like it wanted to be much more than what it actually was and teetered on 'edgy 14 year old' a few too many times. The end with Fletcher in the Mirimax studio really killed any good will I had for the film outside of Hugh Grant unfortunately. Was really excited for this one, bit it was quite a let down.

ffv9tzi,"My ★★½ review of The Gentlemen on Letterboxd https://boxd.it/XWBAR

A prime example of a film's structure actively working against itself. If this had been linear, I think it would actually be quite enjoyable but instead it has an incredibly pretentious narration from Hugh Grant which not only makes the film jump around from subject, location, and time; it also constantly means we have to jump back to Hugh Grant narrating this to Hunham (half of what he's telling to Hunham's character, he would obviously know and would not listen to a long winded recap of). This style of structure is incredibly obnoxious as well as just plain detrimental. The third act pretty much drops this and is so much better for it. The films first scene is what appears to be the murder of the Mcconaugheys lead character, but it's sooo obvious that it's a fakeout that the reveal is insulting, and even if it wasn't a fakeout it would remove all tension from the film. Having Guy Ritchie cameo as himself is fucking laughable, and the fact they portray his office as only having a Man from UNCLE poster instead of Snatch or Lock, Stock is hilariously out of touch. The cast is solid, but boy was the editing, script, and overall direction frustrating. It doesn't even really feel like watching a movie, just a bunch of random scenes being explained to you, with hand drawn lines/names appearing several times as if it's an NFL replay. I have no faith in Guy Ritchie anymore, but I still love Snatch and Lock, Stock as well as enjoying some of his other films (including Man from UNCLE, in case it sounded like I was bashing it).

Sure, but why did it even get that far? In Dry Eye’s introduction in the film, Ray calls Fletcher out for describing Dry Eye as a guns-blazing psycho, to which Fletcher agrees and then labels him as more of a ‘Chinese James Bond’. Sure, the urge for power may have gotten to his head, but Dry Eye was still fairly methodical in his approach, all things considered. Perhaps there’s a slim chance that this is another one of Fletcher’s embellishments, but seeing as we see Dry Eye’s body in the freezer and Mickey gets enraged that Dry Eye’s has touched his wife, that seems highly unlikely. 

Why proceed to assault her right then and there in her office, where Mickey’s people could very easily find them, and after Dry Eye’s only protection had just been shot? That bit really didn’t add up to me.",esvjmz

In context, I think he was so hyped up on adrenaline from that life-or-death turning of the tables (+being a piece of shit at heart) that he didn't even think about it.

The rape scene really made me extremely uncomfortable. I did like how nonchalant Rosalind was about it though. She seemed like an extremely dynamic character that was very strong. 

Laura's death and the fast pace of disaster scenes also really made me upset. I almost walked out after that, because I couldn't stomach it. Not because the film was terrible, just I couldn't deal with it very well. 

I ended up being really glad I stayed. The ending was quite satisfying to me. I loved it. I genuinely hope there is a sequel. It'd be nice if Rosalind's character was further developed. 

The writing in general was unique and it fit really well. I also liked how he pitched the movie within the movie. It was kinda meta and just worked well for me.

Right. I imagine if he was an actor with the ability to choose the roles he plays for a substantial amount of money he wouldn't have chosen that one...

It was not exactly a Mickey Rooney Mr Yunioshi moment, because the joke is not Dry Eye himself, but Fletcher's quip of Dry Eye.

(Here comes the fan fic bull shit) if I were to write the story, I would have created an affect that would have more solidly thrown the narrator into unreliability. Since we’re already using narrative real estate on little quips, I would have used that real estate for some deeper back story like the character being a former low level attorney that got disbarred for lying. “You got experience in the embellishment game, I know about your past life” “my past life is neither here nor there, sure it gave me connections that lubricated me into my current occupation.” Or some such

On the other hand, in Lost City of Z, he was ok but not great, and the other actors around him (especially Robert Pattinson, also Sienna Miller, Tom Holland) were noticeably better. That movie did not really have the great central performance it needed to break through. Charlie Hunnam also managed to do Sons of Anarchy for like six years without ever sounding American.

flnn6wu,"I don't think I agree that it ruined the movie but I'm 100% on board with the notion that his role was written for a British actor. I don't even think they tried to hide that, just hearing some of his lines I couldn't shake that feeling that it was written for a British actor.

There's this flair that I've noticed in the leads of Guy Ritchie's movies, they carry themselves with composed arrogance and as being above a situation but they always manage to ground you into the seriousness of a situation, whole still somehow retaining that flair. I don't know if it's a British thing or whatever it is but it's there.

When I think of Jason Statham as Turkish in Snatch, his character was established early on. Always complaining and with lots of sarcasm and pulling it off with a good understanding of the absurdity that was surrounding him. Like his inquiry of Tommy's gun, he had genuine concern in his face about the fact that he bought a gun but he's condescending and belittling him the entire time (not sure if those words mean the same thing). I don't remember him smiling that much during the movie but he made a shit ton of jokes. And playing the character that way centered a lot of the madness that took place in he movie. There's a scene I love in where they are playing cards and he's explaining just how fucked they are and he's trying to maintain his cool and I forgot what happened but he exploded with ""bollocks, I'm gonna take a walk"". And I love that scene because it was so small but him abandoning his cool demeanor like that really helped cement the idea that they were in danger and without knowing it, you're now rooting for him to survive.

I don't remember Rock n Rolla so well but I remember that Gerard Butler's displayed this over-exaggerated confidence that everything will be okay. He was laughing and smiling all over the place. Like in that scene where he's being chased by that Russian guys. He was reveling in the chase, enjoying it even though he could have been killed.

Thinking about this more I really want to give more credit to Robert Downey Jr for the way he played Sherlock Holmes as an American. He made a good (possibly great) impression of that British flair. I'm not American and wasn't really big on movies for a while so there was a period of time when I thought he was British just because of that movie, I thought he put on an American accent for Iron Man and was now back in England doing English movies. And it was not just because of the accent but the mannerisms and facial expressions, he really sold younger me that he was British.

Edit (I pressed submit by mistake): Matthew McConaughey just didn't bring much of a character to his role, not that he needed to be zany and out there but he did nothing to make me say, I'm rooting for you, he did nothing to make me worried for him. I don't think he fully understood that flair that he was supposed to bring to the role.

Edit: and I do think I made a similar remark about the movie, I thought dry eye’s sexual turn felt out of place.

Tom Holland was sympathetic in his small role, but Charlie Hunnam just didn't quite thread the needle for me. He couldn't really convey that age range and seemed too modern to me as well.

He played someone similar in Shoot Em Up. In that movie, aside from anger, he didn't display any overt emotions, but he still brought the funny, and charm and had the audience rooting for him.

Side note, I just wanna say thank you by the way, because I was asking myself this question for two days and couldn't come up with an answer. I ruled out Tom Hardy because I think he just doesn't really have that look? I shouldn't say I ruled him out, but I just didn't feel confident settling on him.

That role kinda needed the combination of suave and maturity, and a bit of menace. I know Tom Hardy has maturity and menace, but I'm not so sure he'd pull off being suave (I can't see him in that ""good old fashioned cock off"" when those two characters are going on about clothes).

I don't know how familiar most people are with The Merchant of Venice, but it's a Shakespearian play with a pretty offensive Jewish character named Shylock who demands a pound of flesh as payment on default.  So having Mickey demand a pound of flesh from the Jewish guy was a pretty uncomfortable and strange reference.  I guess it would be kind of like punishing a black woman by making her eat shit pie, even though she obviously has nothing to do with the fictional character from The Help?  I don't know.  It was fucking weird.

Tarantino definitely has problems, but I never get the feeling that he actually is racist.  He's misguided and I think a lot of times he thinks because he has black friends and collaborators, he can get away with things like the N word.  But Guy Ritchie doesn't even have that kind of defense, because he hasn't sown any good will in the minority community.  If his defense is say it with love, he hasn't shown any love to make his treatment of minorities in his movie seem affectionate or tongue-in-cheek.  Moreover, I paid to see the movie BECAUSE Henry Golding was in it, so he only got my money because I thought he was supporting Asians in film.  So I was doubly pissed off that I thought this would be a film to push Asians forward, but instead I had to listen to a white audience laughing at the foreignness of Asian names and watch all Asian characters be treated as disposable and scruple-less.",esvjmz

ffvmsfd,"There’s a difference between protagonists and hero’s.

Also, most of (if not all) the racism came from the narrative character who was neither the hero nor the villain. He was just a scummy guy. 

I’m not even a “looks at this sensitive snowflake SJW” guy. If you want to be offended by the racism portrayed in films that’s more than fine. This is just probably the weakest example. Are you as offended that the n-word was used in “The Godfather?” Probably not, because it fits in with the characters, just like the racism in this movie fit in with these characters.",esvjmz

ffrpaih,"It was boring humor that relied on the ""shock"" of racism to be edgy.  The jokes themselves were lazy and unoriginal.  Seriously, the Phuc joke has been made a thousand times before.  But if you loved the race jokes in the movie, save yourself some money and just browse the merchandise at Busted Tees.  It's really teenage t-shirt levels of clever.",esvjmz
