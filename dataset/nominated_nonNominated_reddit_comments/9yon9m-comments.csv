ebdaano,"The scene where Shirley thought Tony was going to leave him for his friends when he was going downstairs to the bar. That scene was just.... I don't even know, such a heartbreaking and heartwarming moment at the same time. Kept thinking about it so I had to come here to comment it.

The fact that Don Shirley was such a high and mighty person, seeing him basically stoop down so low (figuratively) so he wouldn't lose Tony. And then Tony making it clear that leaving wasn't in his intentions at all.

Just Bravo to those two men for that scene. Teared up in the best way possible",9yon9m

ea6k9ab,"Really didn't expect to like this as much as I did, but now I can clearly see why this won the People's Choice Award at TIFF.

There's not much to not like about this. It's an extremely charming film.

Amazing chemistry between Mortensen and Ali, with some truly great performances as well between the both of them. Forgot how good of an actor Mortensen is and this may be one of my favourite characters he's played. I couldn't tell you who won performance wise though, they're both great.

It's actually a genuinely funny movie too, which shouldn't be that big of a surprise considering it's directed by Peter Farrelly. It doesn't overdo the funny though, it still manages to be extremely topical and hit some very poignant and dramatic moments throughout.

Really, my biggest complaint is that maybe it's TOO competent. It's very crowd pleasing and it panders a bit. It's a little predictable. It does all the right things right on the nose. Crowds will love this movie, I'd say the majority of people will really enjoy it... Well unless you're from the Southern United States... It's a bit of a 'fuck you' to Ya'll.

Still, any complaint I have is overshadowed by the great chemistry between the two leads, and the sheer amount of charm that comes out of this film.

I don’t know if it was intentional or not but, there are so many one liners, mannerisms, and interactions that had me and the rest of the theater cracking up. For as heavy the story of Don Shirley can get, the film truly left me in such high spirits. If you get the chance to watch this film, I highly recommend it.   ",9yon9m

ea6znco,"Every time Viggo or has family opened their mouths I had a stupid smile on my face. My grandpa was the last Italian in my family that encouraged that same type of culture of the big family meals, the loud shouting for no reason at the tv, and that quick witted humor. There were a good amount of one liner retorts that made me think grandpa was in the movie, like when one of Tony's brothers was asked to write a letter like Tony did and they said they'd write a letter when she cooked a meal. I'm curious if people that didn't have the firsthand big Italian family experience thought it was as hilarious and endearing to see their interactions.

I was also very happy to see an actor who actually eats in a movie, I know it's silly detail, but it has always bothered me. I think it's really hard to portray a story like this without being cheesy. There was no unnecessary dialog, scene or anything for that matter.

ee1dynf,"One thing really bugs me about this movie. In the beginning, Tony is so racist he throws glasses away just because black people drank from them. 10 minutes later, he takes a job working for a black man? Really?

I feel that just cutting the glasses throwing out of the movie would make a lot more sense. I felt that Tony wasn't the ""hatefully-racist"", but more the casually racist type of character. Like, sure, he assumes all black people eat KFC, but he doesn't look like he thinks all black people are dirty.",9yon9m

eahn9n1,"That shot where the black people were working in the field and stopped to look at Shirley was very powerful. It's a feel good movie that tackled race better than most movies now of days.

However, there was one thing I didn't like about the movie. Tony and Shirley are clearly the main characters, but it felt like Tony was more of a main character. The opening sequence revolved around Tony and Tony also got the better end of movie *""I've changed""* scene. I would've liked to see them end Shirley's arc with his brother or possibly his ex-wife instead of seeing him choosing to sit on a normal chair compared to his throne. They also could've shown how the travel and the friendship changed him in a manner as well as they did with Tony. With how many powerful moments his character had, Shirley's character arc should've had a better conclusion.

Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the movie. Seeing a working class Italian-American and upper class African-American go on a road trip through the South is the a story I never realized I badly wanted to see. ",9yon9m
eexwg04,"I just watched the movie, the trailer really intrigued me and after seeing the comments here on Reddit (mostly saying how “basic” it was) I had to see it.

I absolutely loved it. I seriously cannot understand some of the hate I see here on Reddit from time to time. It’s like every movie needs to be like citizen kane or psico (brilliant masterpieces) so that it can be good.

It’s a good story and it’s a movie that catches your attention from the beginning until the end. It’s a story about learning and about friendship. The racism scenes aren’t super powerful but regardless they are still present. 

I definitely enjoyed it and I wouldn’t be surprised if it won multiple awards. Honestly, one of the best movies I have seen in a while and will probably rewatch it sooner then later ",9yon9m
ehwg83x,That scene of the black farmhands staring at Dr. Shirley as Tony Vallelonga took care of the car on the road nearly brought me to tears.  It felt like centuries of black pain staring Shirley right in the eyes.  Very powerful scene.,9yon9m
ehvnawc,Loved the film but I'm so mad at the ending. Surely it had to end with Tony pouring Doc a glass of champagne in the glass he threw out at the start of the film??? It would have been the perfect ending and brought the film full circle,9yon9m
ea59nn3,"Just out of the theatre, and I loved it. Viggo and Mahersala were phenomenal and watching their characters begrudgingly teach and learn from each other was a delight. I unfortunately missed about the first 30 minutes, but my mom filled me in, and seeing the growth of an uneducated, uncultured racist into at least a slightly more accepting man was really nice to see. Don's uncharacteristic outburst at Tony toward the end really put their relationship into perspective, I think.

I think I went on a bit of a ramble. Definitely a solid movie, tied for my best of the week with Widows.",9yon9m
eb1q6nh,"I loved this movie, mostly for the acting, dialogue, and music. But as a teacher who teaches the Civil Rights Movement, I know my fifth-graders know more about the actual green book than this story projects to American audiences. The booklet, sundown towns, and the general danger of traveling in the South while black during the 40-60s did not come across in this film. Additionally, Dr. Shirely's family has spoken out about a lot of the film's inaccuracies. Why do so many Civil Rights era movies take too many artistic liberties for their films but take away actual liberties from the story themselves?

I hope this movie brings conversation to its audiences.",9yon9m
eehyv5e,"Mortensen and Ali are terrific actors, and thank God for them. Without their charisma (and Viggo’s willingness to shove insane amounts of food down his throat), I fear Green Book would be dead on arrival.

Mostly, I think this is a movie that’s desperately afraid of ‘offending’ anyone. For instance: if there’s a scene with racist cops, there will also be a scene with a good cop down the road, just to make clear that the movie is not stating or suggesting that ‘all cops are/were racist’. It’s also funny that the good-cop scene happens in the snow, to let us know the characters are back in a blue state, where life wasn’t so bad for a black man after all! This is one of the many simplistic moves that indicate to me that the filmmakers were willing to sacrifice the complexities of their themes for a feel-good entertainment.

The script wants both characters to ‘learn’ from each other and eventually change and grow, but to make this happen, it turns them into unrealistic caricatures. It’s a bit frightening how Shirley is portrayed as a complete ignorant of black culture, but it had to be this way so Tony can be the one to ‘introduce’ him to it. Tony’s transformation comes simply from witnessing racism first hand, as if he never experienced such a thing in his life before (maybe another consequence of this being a blue state-red state movie).

I’m surprised Farrelly is being considered as a serious award contender for his direction – besides the performances, that speak for themselves, I think it’s a very uninspired effort. At one point the characters leave the car for no reason other than to have a dramatic confrontation in the rain, as if rainy night equals ‘dramatic weight’. I saw it in a packed movie theater and people seemed to enjoy it. You can’t blame them. The movie has a ‘now everything’s fine’ conclusion that can leave audiences in a good state of mind – but it also shows how simplistic it really is.",9yon9m
ealcyl9,"Crazy to see that audiences (even judging by this thread) generally love the movie, and that critics (at least for online publications) are saying that the movie is empty because it isn't ""woke"" enough and focuses too much on the individuals?  I don't know what the hell to say to that?  How could they have done things differently?  Isn't the point of the story that both Shirley and Lip learn from each other?

Lip starts out as your typical, Italian-American biggoted tough guy who has spent his whole life hustling in the Bronx.  Over the course of the story, he learns that African-Americans aren't just people who like fried chicken and listening to Little Richard music.  He also learns that violence isn't the answer to everything, and that you have to know when to pick your battles.  He changes and becomes lesse bigoted.

Shirley is a gay, African-American concert pianist who sits on a thrown and dresses eccentrically.  He in turn learns from Tony that he is a little out of touch when it comes to things (look at the sharecropper scene), and that dignity isn't ALWAYS going to solve your problems.  This comes to play in the duo's final confrontation in Birmingham where Shirley finally has had enough and tells the racists to pound sand, and murks.  

What could have they done differently to please critics?  It was a character driven story about how the characters changed each other.  I swear, some of these critics love to just bitch, even if the plot was a bit predictable. ",9yon9m

eawelhf,"I mostly liked this movie, though I can see why it's getting some criticism. It's good, but it's a little too neat.

What I liked: If the movie had nothing else, Mortensen and Ali are worth the price of admission. While I get why some people are tired of ""white guy learns to not be racist"" plots, I thought it worked in this, and that's a testament to their performances. As a character piece this works well, because Tony and Dr. Shelby are both so clearly defined and performed. I thought in particular the scene in Memphis where Dr. Shelby offers Tony a raise to continue driving and he sticks with the deal was a good glimpse into the characters. The movie is also pretty funny, the banter between the two is great. I'm also not a big classical music guy, but I really enjoyed the music in the film (was that Chopin that Dr. Shelby played at the bar at the end? I thought that would be a good followup to their earlier conversation). 

What I didn't like: Like I said above, I think it's a little too neat.  For example, the whole ""Getting pulled over in the south vs. the north"" thing didn't really follow with some of the earlier discussion. It's also not a particularly subtle movie. While I thought the scene where they pull over next to the field was powerful, it was also like killing a spider with a sledgehammer, especially considering the horseshoes scene showed the same feeling of isolation with more subtlety. I also thought a lot of the people surrounding Tony in the first 15-20 minutes were little more than stereotypes. I'm seeing from the comments here that some of those characters were played by Tony's real family, but I don't just mean his family. The gangsters at the Copa in the beginning were literally stock characters inserted into the movie. 

Quick nitpick: Wouldn't Tony's gun have come up in the police altercation?

Overall I enjoyed this quite a bit, it's a 4/5 for me. Mortenson and Ali would both be on my hypothetical awards ballot, but neither would be my winner. Does the movie have some cliches?  Yes.  Does it work in spite of those? For me the answer is yes. I really enjoyed watching this, and that's good enough for me.",9yon9m

ebkgyl1,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie but it wasn't exactly what I was expecting walking in. Whether that ended up changing my perception for the better or worse, I'm not sure. However one of the bigger plot lines that i was reflecting back on was the lack of use or perception of use for the Green Book itself. i mean it's the name of the movie, i would've thought that the book itself would have a little more of main storyline. in reality if Tony had never been given the book the movie would have carried on exactly the same minus the one scene where he used it to find them a hotel. one would assume that they might've leaned a little bit more on the knowledge housed in the book and the necessity for such a book like that to be published in the first place.

Apparently Shirley's oldest living family members are not happy with it, and claim that it is ""full of lies.""

If you can understand the fact that it's a hollywood film and not a documentary, *and* be able to overlook the somewhat present white savior tones, it's a very enjoyable flick. 

Ali and Mortensen have incredible chemistry and both give great performances. I loathed the trailer for this movie, I thought it made it look incredibly cheesy. However the film seems to know exactly what it is and it accomplishes what it sets out to do very well. You know when the music is going to swell and the heart strings are going to be pulled, but it still gets you anyways. 

It's less of a commentary film and more of a buddy film. If you go into this expecting some heavy handed intriguing social commentary you'll be disappointed. This film doesn't have anything new to say in that department. Although it does bring up the nat king cole incident very briefly and somewhat touches on ""sundown towns,"" something I'd like to see taught about more. 

I get why black people might not like it, I get why Shirley's family didn't like it, but at the end of the day it still puts a spotlight on the overlooked brilliance and art of Shirley, and somewhat gives a voice to blacks who don't feel ""black enough"" or ""white enough.""",9yon9m

The issues are a lot more complex than presented in the film and it just felt out-dated to modern standards (I mean it works at the same level as fucking Driving Miss Daisy). Maybe instead of showing how people can simply not be racist (which isn't how it works 90% of the time in real life), why not show that racism is still prevalent today? It was all just too feel good. I chuckled a few times and loved both the performances and the music but I felt like a white person wrote it for white people.

Edit: The shit surrounding this movie (like being unfaithful to the true story) and some of the awfully racist shit (like Tony teaching Don to eat KFC because black people love it? WTF was that?

There is a scene where they Tony and Doc are sitting in a hotel hallway drinking and talking about why he plays classical music.

He mentions he can play the greats, Chopin, Beethoven, and a few others. As the scene is going on, we are hearing piano music played in the background.

La fille aux cheveux de lin, The Girl with the Flaxen Hair by Claude Debussy, a composer they do not mention as the greats.",9yon9m

But it was okay for a film written by white dudes. I understand the outrage but if you take the drama out it is a solid film. Also tbh they didn't try to make Viggk like a saint. He was very flawed but tried to make him understand the problems with race. I think a lot of African Americans want a film in their POV to win a BEst Pictire so I understand the outrage a bit.

eh1y14s,"This movie isn’t offensively bad, but it’s not particularly great either. I watched it as part of my attempt to watch all the Oscar nominees, and I’m shocked it was nominated for Best Picture alongside movies like Roma and Blackkklansman. Not to say it isn’t a decent movie, just that it’s so inoffensive, safe, and cliche that I feel like I’ve seen it a million times before. It’s like Baby’s First Commentary on Racism - hey guys, not all black people have to conform to society’s idea of black people, they can be more cultured than white people, and poor white people aren’t bad either! Racism is over! It’s a fine message, and a cute friendship, but it’s nothing new or noteworthy.

EDIT: Also, shoutout to the racist ass people in the row in front of me who were literally hooting and hollering at the scene where the characters got pulled over and the cop called Tony “half nigger” because he was Italian. Also loved when the cops called the Doctor an “it” in the police station, and chimed in with “Being black” in response to “What am I being charged for?” ",9yon9m
ea5jb21,"So something happened during my screening that's never happened before: the power for the entire theater went out with about 25 minutes left. Unless the last bit of the movie involved Martin Luther King meeting Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) and thanking him for ending racism forever, I doubt my opinion would have been significantly different. However, I am curious to know (it went out when Ali started playing at the chicken place in Alabama), so if anyone who sees it could fill me in on the end using the spoilers tag I would appreciate it.

Green Book is a delightful buddy comedy combined with a very clunky movie on race. I didn't think the movie was indicating racism is a thing of the past (and a couple of times it lightly pokes the ""racism was also a huge problem in the North in the 60s too"" bear), but everything it said has been done in movies a million times before and didn't have anything remotely insightful to say about it. Mortensen and Ali are wonderful together on screen as a classic odd couple and when they lean into that (which is most of the first hour of the film), it's a hoot but the second half is nowhere near as strong because it leans much harder into an exploration of race and bigotry from the 1960s that's not interesting or very smart (it still insists that racism is mainly a problem of individuals and not of systems, which it is). The other problem I had is that they introduce  Don Shirley (Ali) as Gay (or bi) in one scene and pretty much never mention it again, which is...odd. It's like they thought ""well, he was gay and people will complain if we pretend he wasn't, but we have no interest whatsoever in exploring this aspect of the character.""

Still, I would ultimately recommend it as a very likable movie with bunch clunky elements shoved in there that definitely hurt the film, but aren't enough to bring it down.",9yon9m

This is a theme that I think people are overlooking. His racism in this first scene is pushed on him.

It's nicely mirrored by the scene at the end when he returns for Christmas, and his brother in law uses a slur to ask about Doc Shirley. Tony forcefully pushes back; ""Don't call him that.""

I disagree with both statements. The scene itself was powerful but never adds anything. He sees the plight of his own race but it never affects him in any way. 

Also, the film does not tackle race well at all. Shirley's inability to understand what his people are going through (which is still completely inaccurate to how the dude was in real life) is thrown aside for some ""look, I went from racist to not racist"" schlock. It is simplistic, way too light for dealing with such a heavy subject, and just trite (I mean it is literally just Driving Miss Daisy again). If you want a film that tackles race well, go ahead and watch Blackkklansman, Blindspotting, Sorry to Bother You, hell even Black Panther.

It was also an amazing detail for a later part of the movie. Another example was at the very end of the film - once you hear the doorbell in Tony's house, I was expecting Shirley at the door. I think the director played with us a little bit there.

We are forgiving of Tony's racism because because he is ignorant and good at heart.

Personally, I was really happy it didn't hit you over the head with stupid one liners like ""We would never elect anyone like that to be president"" a la Blackkklansman. Yes, we get it, racism is still alive. Not every movie has to try to be so desperately relevant.

I read some articles about the relationship between Shirley and Lip, and I think it was understandable that the filmmakers chose not to explore Dr. Shirley's homosexuality more. He was an intensely private man who was never out of the closet, and if Tony's son Nick was to be believed, the incident at the Y was the only indication he ever heard mentioned by his father or Shirley about Shirley's sexuality. When Nick asked Dr. Shirley if he could make a film about him, he was supportive, but with one stipulation - make it after he's gone. He never explained, but Nick always thought it was mainly because he didn't want his homosexuality to be a topic while he was still alive. ",9yon9m

Because it is still very bad right now. If you don't think institutional racism doesn't exist and it is just ""victim propaganda"" then that is naive. It still does exist, and even if it is to a lesser extent, it isn't enough for the men in power to pat themselves in the back for.

Green Book doesn't present anything accurately. Black people suffered more than just being unable to use a normal toilet or being randomly arrested.

The movie would have done a better job if it didn't sugar coat the racism and violence against black people (especially in the South were a lot of the movie took place in) back then and showed how things haven't changed much. Black people are still suffering a lot. Not as much as in the 1900s but they are still being unfairly treated. Why doesn't the movie explore more than just ""racism is bad""? Why doesn't the movie show that racism being solved isn't as simple ""speaking and being friendly to POC""? The movie's message isn't even deep and any stance taken against racism rings hollow because the writer is an Islamophobic piece of shit. The movie is made for white people who don't understand the complexities of the plights of black people and say they aren't racist because they have a black friend or because they voted for Obama.

Tony reassures Doc he's not leaving him   Also, in the same scene, when Tony heads down the stairs and Doc says ""Sorry about last night"" (referring to the YMCA incident).  Tony thoughtfully says ""Don't worry about it, I've worked nightclubs all my life and I know it's a complicated world.""
