f5668v9,"Great performance by Eddie.  He really projects a strong spirit of generosity that a lot of actors don't have.

Probably his best movie since 1999 (Life, Bowfinger(",dmicfu
f5811uq,"I loved how uplifting this movie was. Every setback I was expecting everything to come crashing down, but all the lows are followed by the highs. I thought it was pretty inspirational and an absolutely blast to watch.

Great performances, great pacing. Overall awesome movie",dmicfu
f57nq7u,Being dedicated to Charlie Murphy was great.,dmicfu
f5dk63n,"Another thing that I loved about this biopic is that it doesn‚Äôt involve somebody getting on drugs, getting into a bad relationship,or getting into a good relationship and they couldn‚Äôt have done it without them. I love that we got a movie about a really good guy who totally defied the odds.",dmicfu
f55p9zy,"Saw this in a theater a few days ago, the scene where they film the sex scene had the whole theater in tears. one of the funniest scenes I've seen this year!",dmicfu
f5ea1qq,"Some of my favorite parts:

1. The scene in the hotel where all the lights finally came on
2. Wesley Snipes proudly saying he was in Rosemary's Baby, only for the others to call him out on playing the elevator operator
3. Unbilled cameos from Chris Rock and Bob Odenkirk
4. Honestly, every scene with Eddie Murphy. When he puts effort into a role, he really knocks it out of the park.",dmicfu
f582qzd,Wesley Snipes absolutely killed it. He is by far my favorite in the whole movie.,dmicfu
f56qye9,"Just saw the movie and it is excellent.  This is easily Eddie Murphy‚Äôs best role since Coming to America. It‚Äôs also  one of the best performances  I‚Äôve seen this year, Eddie Murphy really poured his heart and soul into this character and the movie and it shows.  Great direction, costumes, set design and the supporting cast were all great especially Wesley Snipes. Highly recommend.",dmicfu

f551pp5,What a great fucking movie!,dmicfu
f5jvhtc,"This was such a wholesome and uplifting story of striving to create your art and never letting anyone stand in the way of it. Like a much more entertaining and actually coherent ""The Disaster Artist.""

The standout scene for me was the part when he and his buddies went to watch the movie The Front Page and not understanding its humor or appeal. To me, it was meant to show that every piece of art isn't meant to be understood or appreciated by everyone, and that's totally fine. It showed how valuable it is for many different (read: diverse) artists with distinct tastes and backgrounds to create their own stories and works so that every possible audience can be catered to.

I fear this movie is going to fly underappreciated and not gain much traction in the awards race this season. This movie deserves all the praise it can get.",dmicfu
f554y9s,"This movie was so much goddamn fun, and Eddie is absolutely great. The entire cast kills it. Is it the best movie of the year? No. Is it the most fun I‚Äôve had watching a movie this year? Yes. Absolutely love it, highly recommended.",dmicfu
f57zk7e,"Unbelievable - my face hurt from smiling so much. So much fun to watch, I can only imagine how much fun it was to make.

I lost it when Snipes as Martin explained the difference between filming black people and white as *a cinemagical...reality*. üòÇ",dmicfu
f5t3lxu,"This movie is raunchy, it's vulgar, but most of all it has a warm heart and spirit that can't be resisted. This is the best feel-good movie I've seen in years.

f55cyw3,"Da‚ÄôVine Joy Randolph really stole the show for me here, especially with her monologue at the end.  Would love for her to get some recognition along with Eddie and Wesley

f5o8575,"Man I loved it.

On DVD, I have almost every one of the movies referenced in this film: Blacula, Blackenstien, Dolemite, Superfly, Shaft, etc. I knew the Dolemite story and I'd even heard one of Rudy Ray Moore's albums.

So, of course, I'm totally checking this movie for accuracy and it absolutely did not disappoint. I found no blatant anachronisms, no mis-steps, and very little changing of the story for dramatic effect. (*Though: Dimension Films picked up ""Boss Nigger"" in 1975, the same year Dolemite came out. That might have been a minor error, but I'd have to research it further. That's the film referenced when Snipes' character says ""My friend Black Caesar just called. We're going to do a real movie."" If the timing is accurate, the turnaround for Boss Nigger must have been short*).

What I really loved about the film is Eddie Murphy's ability to step away from being himself and let his great acting shine through. He could have easily been ""Eddie Murphy pretending to be Rudy"" (kinda like Will Smith pretending to be Ali), but instead he actually nails the role with the right amount of subtlety to make it work.

Wesley Snipes as D'urville Martin was *awesome*. That's exactly how Mr Martin used to talk: you can hear it in movies like Legend of Nigger Charley and Boss Nigger. Again: not pretending, but really acting.

Just all around I'm very, very happy with it, especially as a blaxploitation fan.",dmicfu
f5vdxbu,"I liked the part where there weren't any haters in the group (yeah i know Wesley snipes but he wasnt part of the main support system for eddie) and there wasn't any dumb ""falling out"" that took up a whole act.  They all showed support for each other the enter way.",dmicfu
f559x58,"The cast is the highlight. Eddie Murphy is absolutely amazing, he delivers both pathos and charm. The writers, same guys who did Ed Wood, really know how to make you cheer on the protagonist by setting up their world, their dreams & desires, and showing their pitfalls versus the big ladder they must climb to reach their version of success. I rooted for him from frame one.

Wesley Snipes cannot be forgotten in this Oscar race, he stole the show every scene he was in, and that's going up against Eddie Murphy of all people. Keegan, Kodi, Tituss, Craig, Da'vine, even T.I. -- they all were pretty phenomenal. 

I wish the pacing was a little tighter, it would've brought the score up a bit for me, but I still really enjoyed it. I don't know if I'd ever watch it in whole again, but there's definitely parts and moments that stick out in my mind. Oddly reminded me a lot of another Eddie Murphy movie, Bowfinger!",dmicfu
f5jxau8,"Just by seeing the trailer, I could tell that Eddie was perfectly cast and suspected that the movie would be hilarious. What I didn't expect was how nuanced his performance would be and how much I would end up caring about his character. Sometimes you laughed at Rudy's hustle, but Eddie's performance kept a core sense of kindness and dignity, which (along with some masterful writing) helped prevent Rudy from becoming the butt of the joke. So yeah... it was funny as hell, but I was  also cheering on that rag tag group like they were the god damn Mighty Ducks!

I'll also add, as much fun as this movie was, it was also a fascinating peek into a world I knew very little about. I've been trying to think of an apt comparison... a comedy film that delivers (without absurdity or irony) a genuine lesson on history and culture... and I can't for the life of me think of one.

Basically, what I'm trying to say... not only was this movie hilarious... but it also felt 'worthwhile'.  Some might call it a 'full meal'.",dmicfu
f56uio6,"I‚Äôm 2 minutes in and goddamn have I missed Eddie Murphy. His dramatic movies are mixed, but even a bad Eddie Murphy movie gets at least one laugh from his fast talking persona.",dmicfu
f550ew0,Bob Odinkirk didn't get a credit!,dmicfu
f56xnyw,I liked it a lot. The characters were really fun and it covered the interesting parts of the production hell that this movie was for Moore. It was an entertaining movie about an entertaining guy. I liked the end with the kid because it reminded me of one of my professors talking about how he loved his records as a kid because it was so funny hearing him curse.,dmicfu
f5y98od,A lot of heart and some really great performances for a fairly simplistic biopic. Nothing too gut wrenching in this and a lot of the struggles feel handwaved away just as quickly as they are introduced. Did not regret watching this at all. Eddie did a great job. Wesley too!,dmicfu
f567wr6,Craig Robinson blew up,dmicfu
f6a18l3,That sex scene was something else. Eddie Murphy really brings it.,dmicfu
fdmtaar,I had no idea this was based on a true story so when they showed the clips in the credits I was laughing so hard. ‚ÄúBitch are you for real?‚Äù,dmicfu

f5rf0a9,[deleted],dmicfu
f6ipdfk,"Eddie Murphy is back. In a big way. 

Absolutely steals the screen in this movie and disappears behind the performance of Rudy Ray Moore. The whole cast is great really, especially Wesley Snipes who plays a full of himself actor amazingly. 

The costumes are awesome, as is the general art direction. The film feels of its time. The story is a bit formalic of a biopic. Yes it's original because of the subject matter, but it felt eerily similar to the Disaster Artist from awhile back.

I've heard of the Dolemite movies through Red Letter Media, but I feel like I have to check them out now. They look so over the top and fun. BITCH ARE YOU FOR REAL? 

It was refreshing to see Eddie Murphy in a role like this again. Murphy was born for R rated films. He also hasn't lost a step at all. The dude fucking killed it and if he isn't nominated for an Oscar this year at least, the academy is a sham. Dude is a legend. 

It's really funny and has a great message about going after your dreams, no matter what. Really enjoyed it. 

Shoot for the moon. And if you miss it, cling on to a motha fuckin' star.",dmicfu
f5vs3y1,"I‚Äôm highly amused to see so many people calling this ‚ÄòThe Feel-Good Movie of the Year.‚Äô  


IMPORTANT: I don‚Äôt think people who say that are wrong. But this is a movie where the protagonist says shit like ‚Äòyour sister got so slow she sucked a earthworm‚Äôs dick!‚Äô and ‚ÄòI got thrown out of South Africa for fucking steers. I fucked King Kong‚Äôs mama till she broke down in tears!‚Äô


I really enjoy RRM‚Äôs movies and I‚Äôm glad that there‚Äôs a movie that will introduce him to a much wider audience. It‚Äôs just funny to be that this X-rated as fuck motherfucker can now be a hero to general audiences.",dmicfu
f555ckz,This movie was so damn fun haha. I feel like I haven't seen much of Eddie Murphy in a while so I hope this is the start to a lot more movies staring him. Still hilarious and a damn good actor.,dmicfu
f5836jv,"One thing I would say is that the second half of the movie is significantly better then the first.  The first half is a little slow, but once they get to the the movie theater the whole thing goes to a different level.",dmicfu
f5d4sdj,"Fucking Wesley Snipes man. I missed you so much, you may be an asshole but holy shit you're a great actor.

And welcome back Eddie.",dmicfu
f8aak0t,"I kinda remember watching Dolemite movies back in the day.  (if you remember them well, you weren't in the right state of mind!)  

Eddie kills it.  The whole movie kills it.  The scene between Key and Murphy discussing plot had me rolling.  Classic Eddie, but it was Key that nailed it there.

I can see why Eddie did this film.  It was classic Raw, but it has a positive message.  This was a washed up middle aged black man that reinvented himself and let nothing stop him.  And Moore ripped a lot of his material from traditional handed down stories.  It's layered American black culture.",dmicfu
f83rpcu,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Learning about his tenacity to be a legend was very inspiring. This is my favorite movie for 2019!,dmicfu
f57dymn,"The last message before the credits rolled. Not gonna lie, but actually shed a tear. RIP, Darkness. 

My Movie of the Year. Made me smile, laugh, and honestly feel good as I watched it.",dmicfu
f5r6a7n,"What an absolutely well made feel-good movie. 

Sex scene had to be rewinded several times. 

Wesley and pretty much everyone *killed*. 

I don't watch movies anymore because I think they are rushed, yet this was a great watch, have recommended it to everyone.",dmicfu
f6do8vt,"Why didn't Ricco and the other homeless folk re-appear to demand ""royalties"" or some kind of monetary compensation after they shared all that material with Rudy, who then passed off all that material as his own (polished nonetheless) while making a lot of money off it? Kicking them out of the Dunbar Hotel seemed like rubbing salt into the ""wound"" too after all they shared with him...",dmicfu
f5q3vy0,"Fantastic feel-good movie, one of my favourites of this year. Still riding that post-movie high.

Surprised there is so little discussion about Rudy and Lady Reed's friendship, it's so sweet and innocent.

When Lady Reed calls herself Rudy's prot√©g√©,  when she thanks him for putting someone like her in the movie and the little moment at the end where she looks back as he entertains the crowd outside the theatre were all touching moments.

Da'Vine Joy Randolph absolutely kills it, I hope there'll be more roles for her in the future.",dmicfu
f55rr29,"WOW. I haven't seen it yet but I am legit shocked this is getting great reviews. I was betting on this being a big let down. Guess I was flat out wrong, I'll go eat my plate of crow now.",dmicfu
f6mdg7g,"I knew nothing about Dolemite before seeing this, but I really want to see this Dolemite movie now. Where can I watch it? While watching this, I was reminded how much I always liked Eddie Murphy's almost too optimistic outlook that he brings too all of his characters. I remember it in the beginning of Haunted Mansion, and we see it again here while they're making the movie and so many things go wrong and he still manages to put on this fake smile. It's hilarious and something he does really well.",dmicfu
f7ptwrn,"Very good movie, but I think there are some cliches in the script and I've never liked that in a movie. What surprised me the most was finding out that this guy existed üòÇüòÇ I think Eddie was fantastic, and Wesley Snypes made laugh A LOT üòÇ never thought he could fit so well in a comedy movie. Maybe the best biopic of this year.",dmicfu
f565t7e,The movie is hilarious and entertaining but also so wonderfully speaks to today‚Äôs modern indie filmmaking challenges and DIY necessities to get a vision made.,dmicfu
f5qqeam,"Eddie Murphy was great in this movie, but Wesley Snipes's character had me in tears from laughing so hard.",dmicfu
f6mdj0g,"Why are there no movie reviews from Screen Junkies, Stuckmann, Jahns and RedLetterMedia? 

I know Jay saw it and liked it based on twitter. Was hoping to see them discuss it.",dmicfu
f6ff8e1,"Love this movie, I've watched Dolemite so many times over the years, each character that popped up in this movie, I was automatically assigning them to a main or background character in Dolemite.


Shout out to Ol Dirty Bastard for introducing me to Dolemite on his last music video ever;

This movie has always been a cult classic and I'm glad it's starting to get mainstream recognition outside of ""that movie that Black Dynamite references"".

Do yourself a favor if you want to see a movie that has all the ""Exorcisms, ghost, and haunted shit"" that Eddie Murphy's character was saying he originally wanted in Dolemite...go check out [Disco Godfather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC3kcOKebfc), it ended up in that movie.",dmicfu

In a weird way it kinda reminded me on Tim Burton's 'Ed Wood', one off my all-time favorite movies, in that it's clearly a love letter to the subject and the era they live in with an incredible cast. Very fun movie, would definitely recommend to others.",dmicfu

Such a positive, uplifting film with a tremendous cast. Eddie Murphy was brilliant. He just radiates natural talent and charisma. It‚Äôs genuinely mind boggling to understand how/why his career has been locked in film purgatory in recent years when you watch him perform like this. His best role for a very, very long time IMO.  I loved his beautiful friendship with Lady Reed who was equally as awesome. She absolutely sollllld her character to me and I was rooting for her throughout.

The real standout to me, though, was Wesley Snipes. Wow! Just totally different to any other role I have seen him in and he looked like he had SO. MUCH. FUN!

Honestly, this movie just felt very safe and a bit bland.  By the time they started shooting the movie it just made me want to actually go watch Dolemite instead. Which I did, and I found that far more raw/funny/entertaining than this film which just doesn't quite capture the spirit of Rudy Ray Moore.

The biggest complaint I have is about Eddie Murphy. His impression of Rudy Ray Moore was actually....Donkey and Mushu, not Rudy Ray Moore.   He's a producer on the film so why didn't Eddie spend more time actually watching the Dolemite movies and nailing Rudy Ray Moore's hilarious approach to reading lines and the way he would curse with all of the energy of the sun behind it?

f5imxhq,">Black people absorb light, white people reflect light.  
>  
>This is cinemagical reality""

This line meant so much. I'm black. Had a black neighbor, 25-30 years my senior. I was helping him with his photography (I'm not a photographer but at the time in design school).

He had a problem whereby he would take photos of black people (eg. wedding during the day) and everyone's face was too dark. Since he was charging these people for the work, that was becoming an issue for him, as you can imagine, when all the pictures come back with dark faces hidden in shadow.

So I did some quick learning and figured out the problem. I returned to his house and explained to him that black people photograph differently from white people, because white people's skin reflects light, and black people much less so, so that white people have the advantage of contrast. His face, when I said that, I could tell he was deflated by my stating white people have an advantage; its not really an advantage, so much as a convenience, when considering all the dynamics of light in the picture, but I feared he interpreted it as an advantage.

You really just have to compensate for darker tones by setting the exposure differently, and if you're doing professional portraits have black people not wear bright white. For example, on TV, its common to have black subjects wear light-gray, which comes off as white, when you set the exposure for black skin. Cameras have better dynamics, now, and especially pro cameras, but 10-20 years ago skin tone was even more a crucial consideration, and you really had to know what you were doing with exposure and lighting to capture black people correctly.",dmicfu

Instead he meets Lady Reed, and they just develop a supporting friendship, and help make each other's dreams come true (going further together than alone).

The rhyming, rapping disses were a cultural phenomenon, not a personal achievement of Ricco.

The movie makes sure to point out that this type of comedy was a common ""lower"" form of comedy done between disadvantaged people.

First they have Ricco mention that he is not a source of original material, he says, ""I'm a repository of African American culture."" Not verbatim.

Second they mention that it's been going on in prisons among black inmates for years.

Third, RRM specifically says that what is needed is someone who has real showmanship to polish the act and make it more cohesive.

Fourth, when he is actually recording the rhymes at the homeless camp, it is specifically shown that everyone there has their own takes on the style and everyone is contributing to the tape.",dmicfu
f5b86rh,"Half of Rudy's lines were to pump himself up like a promoter. If you think of it as him being his own personal carnival barker out to promote himself, then yeah, it's designed to be cliched.

The character might've been included to further demonstrate that Rudy was a sort of beacon for outsiders and the untraditional. Considering the movie was set in the 70s (within the black community, no less), it seemed significant that this character was so open with his sexuality and yet this detail was almost entirely a non-factor in the grand scheme of things. 

Or... ya know... maybe Rudy had a bunch of overtly homophobic material on his records and this was a way to show people that it was 'just jokes' and that he actually had close, gay friends in his personal life.",dmicfu

f57543g,"I‚Äôm with you, kinda shocked it‚Äôs got such a strong reception. It‚Äôs a better than average comedy, but the reviews and the Oscar buzz had me expecting something far better. 

The actors manage to do a lot with a genuinely awful script, every single line is bursting with exposition. Nothing about the characters goes unsaid or left for interpretation. If a character wants something it‚Äôs spoken, if there is a barrier to them getting something it‚Äôs spoken. The first act is just Rudy saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna be the best‚Äù and everyone telling him ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt be the best‚Äù - literally as explicitly as I‚Äôve written it here. 

I was also expecting some analysis of the fact he stole all of his jokes from homeless people, had someone else write his film, and built his entire career on other people‚Äôs talent while leaving them in the gutter. It seemed like the film was setting up some kind of critique that never came.

It‚Äôs well structured and the acting is decent, but it‚Äôs nowhere near deserving of the praise it gets. It‚Äôs one of those examples where an average piece of filmmaking benefits from having remarkable source material. Felt similar in quality to Bohemian Rhapsody or Rocketman (neither of which I liked personally), so if you enjoy those you may enjoy this too.

Overall I‚Äôd give it a 6/10. Not a bad film as films go, but nowhere near one of the best of the year.",dmicfu

*Ackchyually*, historically color film really was racist: the light sensitivity was specifically calibrated for white skin. Vox did a great short video about this: [Color film was built for white people. Here's what it did to dark skin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d16LNHIEJzs).

> Cameras have better dynamics, now, and especially pro cameras, but 10-20 years ago skin tone was even more a crucial consideration, and you really had to know what you were doing with exposure and lighting to capture black people correctly.

Yeah, totally. By the time your neighbor was doing photography this issue was finally being addressed in the analog film department, but then we made the switch to *digital cameras*. The first decade those had an impossibly low dynamic range to work with. Luckily even phone camera's do fairly well with high-contrast scenes nowadays.",dmicfu

It's also the first in a big wave of planned Eddie Murphy projects. Coming 2 America is coming out next year and Beverly Hill Cop 4 is in the works, he's going to host SNL this December, and he's going back to standup.",dmicfu
f5jthn6,Ohhh yea that's who he is,dmicfu
f56zzxc,"No problem.  I'd highly recommend at some point to check out the other RRM films, especially Human Tornado and my personal favorite Petey Wheatstraw.  They're kind of varied in terms of quality but if you like Dolemite and enjoy the camp and charm of good/bad movies, they're super fun (especially with friends and a few drinks in you!).

The plot synopsis of Petey Wheatstraw gives you some idea of how bonkers fun it is:  

*Beginning life as the afterbirth to a watermelon, the young Wheatstraw becomes a martial artist, but is unable to best the evil comedy team of Leroy and Skillet, who also indulge in wholesale murder. Satan restores the comedians' victims to life, and charges Petey with the task of marrying his clock-stoppingly ugly daughter to giving him a grandchild. When Petey attempts to default on the deal, he is pursued by the devil's henchmen.* 

It doesn't mention that upon being resurrected, Petey is given a pimp cane with magic powers.  Oh, also he tries to get out of his engagement by making a mask of his face and putting it on a wino.  I mean... it's genius!",dmicfu

f56tb8z,And its just silly. The idea that a great dramatic performance inherently has more skill/value then a great comedic performance has always been illogical to me.  A great comedic performance takes a mastery of timing/delivery and it can invoke just as much emotion out of the audience.,dmicfu
