dal86ij,"I loved how [Edward got his revenge by publishing a novel that has the potential to be a bestseller, assuming his writing is as suspenseful as what we see onscreen (which, based on how much Susan seems to like the novel after being critical of him in the past, it is). Edward sees money in his future for the first time ever. And he got there by doing the opposite of what Susan told him to do - writing about himself. Meanwhile, Susan's lifestyle is falling apart because of her husband's financial troubles. So now she's stuck with a guy she doesn't love but married (in part) for his money, and that seems to be on the way out. So she's trying to go back to Edward, but he's clearly over her. It's a revenge story within a revenge story.](#spoiler)",5exedm
dasdzge,"I just saw this movie yesterday [and have been wondering if it is possible that Edward didn't actually stand Susan up?](#spoiler)

If you can bear with me:

The relevance of Susan's perception, and sort of overall take on what happened between her and Edward, take the forefront in this film a number of times.  We see the novel play out for us colored by Susan's personal touch-- we see it in the likenesses of Tony and his wife and daughter's characters.  We see it in the obese women from Susan's art installation, in the setting of the novel outside of the bar.    

[We then also see that Susan's perception of the relationship is that she had done something really 'brutal' to Edward.  She believes that she's done something very horrible to him. She feels guilty.  She subconsciously is anticipating revenge.  When we see the giant revenge painting at the gallery, it feels like some kind of looming foreshadowing for the story, but then we learn that she purchased the painting herself-- the threat of revenge is only looming in her mind.   She is scaring herself, and then not even realizing she is the one doing it.  We then immediately see her scare the shit out of herself with the jumpscare scene where she imagines Ray is in the baby's room not he phone.  She is on edge.  She is expecting something coming... we see this also when she is reading the novel.  The scenes between the novel, and her real life, often transition through a startle.  But the story itself isn't honestly like, suspenseful in a jumpscare way.](#spoiler)

[The novel itself, is a tale of revenge in a way, but does it actually in the end, tell a story where we feel like anything was gained from the revenge?  Tony doesn't actually seem to Feel the thirst for revenge-- it seems like what he's looking for is closure but it looks like he is expecting it through answers, through a dialogue, he wants to know what happened, he wants the details. We see Tony devastated more than we see him angry or vengeful.  His detective friends seems to seek justice--but his character, while coming off on the surface as in control and masculine, is basically emasculated by his illness.  What we do see of Revenge in the novel, is embodied in a character that when it comes down to it is weak, absent, and vomiting when Tony is in the room with the two men who devastated his life. He's doesn't seem driven by revenge--we see that when he falters when he actually HAS the opportunity. He can't shoot them.  He can barely point the gun at them.  He doesn't violently hurt Ray in the end.  He shoots him in self defense.  And if we call that revenge, then what revenge he does end up getting, lands him blind, and ultimately dead, anyway.   Do we get the idea that Edward is enacting vengeance, from his novel really, or from Susan's life? Do we feel like Edward is even really telling us a such a clear cut revenge tale?  Or do we end up allowing our reading of his story to be colored by Susan's heavy handed expectation for revenge, with the giant revenge painting, with her jumpiness, her anxiety....](#spoiler)

[And finally, in the end-- we don't actually see Susan respond to Edward's message that he is happy to meet up with her to talk.  We never see them actually arrange to meet.  We see her email to him asking to meet.  We see him saying yea just tell me when and where.  And the next thing wee see, is her getting ready to go, with emphasis on her shallowness, on the things that Edward exemplifies that opposite of.   And then we see her enter some incredibly fancy, expensive, elitist restaurant.  Not the kind of place you think that a woman who has realized the emptiness and hollowness of her shallow life choices, and wants now to jump back into more genuine, true things with Edward.](#spoiler)  

[My reading is that she didn't actually respond to Edward.  That she Chose her shallow and empty lifestyle, once again. We see her fear and guilt taking over her judgement-- she is once again, not brave enough to immerse herself in what Edward symbolizes to her.  It wasn't just her relationship with him that she couldn't bring herself to choose, but she also couldn't really indulge it in herself. She couldn't jump into things creatively, always more concerned with material concerns.   And it leaves her lonely.  But she chose it in the beginning, and she chooses it again at the restaurant, even though it leaves her feeling the pangs of nostalgia (as she occasionally glances at the door--as she notes the conversation behind her of someone being shown to their seat imagining if it were Edward). She is so paralyzed, once again, by her fear of what Edward represents, and watching that play out in her anticipation to receive some kind of revenge, that she doesn't take the risk.  We as the viewers, have been watching this through the perception of Susan-- so we too, are anticipating revenge from Edward.  But in her anticipation of that, she ultimately sabotages herself.] (#spoiler) 

[We never see her check her phone to see if he has texted or called--even though the film integrates this kind of communication into the film between her and edward and her and her husband.  It leaves it out here.](#spoiler)

Also, considering how jumpy she has been, she isn't actually all that nervous or anxious here.  She seems somewhat uncomfortable, but ultimately more at ease, or more decided, than she has been at many other points in the film.](#spoiler)",5exedm

dc40su7,"The novel is an aligory for the break up. If you've ever been left suddenly, the novel represents what it feels like. Aaron taylors character and his friends are all Susan Marrow. Edward was in a relationship and believed everything was going smoothly (the beginning cruse through west Texas). Suddenly Susan tells him that she is unhappy and leaves him. If you have ever been left, it feels brutal. The loss and pain are represented by ray Marcus's bruatality. It's almost unbelievable. Edward would be thinking, ""how can you do this to us"". The wife's death in the novel represents the death of the woman who loved him. When someone leaves you they are no longer the person who loved you. Something else takes over. They become someone else. She became Ray Marcus. One minute they loved you, and now they are acting like someone else. Edward fights to find out where his old love went. it is very painful to realize that the person who used to love you is no Loner there( when he find out she was killed by Ray). Ray is the new personality of his wife and it is not just a faze (ray gets out of jail and continues to exist).  He must confront the new person. Ray's death is Edward confronting and accepting that the woman who used to love him is gone. Edwards death is the death of the part of him that loved his wife. He got over it. ",5exedm

(""Once you give up [on love] you might never get it back."") Edward got his revenge, he broke apart her relationship with Walker the same way Walker broke apart their's. Mission accomplished.

So now what is Edward doing at the end when he's not at the restaurant? Killing himself? Killing Walker? When Edward emails her back, he doesn't care when or where but it has to be Tuesday. I think there's a reason for that, he's planning something.",5exedm
dafv661,"**5/5**


Susan Morrow’s (Amy Adams) thoughts towards Nocturnal Animals hits it right on the nose: “It’s violent and it’s sad”. ‘Nocturnal Animals’ in this context is a typescript of Morrow’s ex-husband’s (Jake Gyllenhaal) first effort at a novel, and bears more than a few similarities to the way in which the couple broke up to be merely coincidental…


Morrow herself is an art gallery owner, specialising in an oddball raunch that dominates the screen during the film’s opening credits. She’s stranded in a loveless marriage to a hunky husband (Armie Hammer) who’s more occupied with work (and other women) than anything regarding his wife. Cue the ex-husband’s typescript, sent to Morrow at a time when she’s in desperate want of connection. A way to contact her ex again – just what she needs, right? Not quite.


The novel within a film plunges headfirst into a highway scene with a ferocious intensity that rivals Sicario’s border crossing scene last year. It’s a jagged, welcome tonal shift, tinged with uncertainty over what’s going to happen. In fact, the whole narrative of Nocturnal Animals – both the film itself and its titular typescript – is unpredictable, and we can’t help but sympathise with the main character’s (Jake Gyllenhaal) hapless plight in this thrilling revenge story.


Back in the real world – shot with fusty gusto – Morrow is mulling over the story and recollecting haunted memories of her prior life with her ex-husband. There’s a sense of disconnect, of lack of relevance, but suddenly parallels between their romance and the typescript’s narrative become apparent, building to a devastating final scene that’s as electrifying as it is inevitable. The film is endlessly evolving, bludgeoning past brutal plot points and descending into irresistible, dirty delirium, heightened by Abel Korzeniowski’s sublimely tempestuous score. Yet director Tom Ford and cinematographer Seamus McGarvey give control to the chaos, with an assuredness applied to the kinetic camerawork, the brooding pans of musty citylife and desolate deserts. The danger and immorality on display really is tangible.


One source of danger comes in the form of Aaron Taylor Johnson’s terrifying and unhinged Ray Marcus, who torments Gyllenhaal and his fictional family. This is Johnson’ best performance of his career, committing to his character’s sleaziness and repugnancy, and preventing Ray from becoming caricaturish. Another brilliantly absurd character is the cop looking for him, played by Michael Shannon with straight-faced hilarity. He’s a character inflicted with lung cancer, who continues to smoke (“Well, yep, that’s how it works”), and nearly steals the show with his deadpan delivery and questionable morals. Other recognisable, or renowned actors, are relegated to the sidelines, however: Michael Sheen and Jena Malone each feature in blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameos, but at least their fleeting moments are highlights.


I’ve seen this film twice now, which I suppose is testament to how the film grips – and then sinks its claws into you. It’s menacing, and bold, and each scene is displayed with enough unwavering confidence and dedication by Ford (save for one Gyllenhaal outburst) that it all holds together. That this is only his sophomoric effort, after his acclaimed ‘A Single Man’, is truly astonishing. He may not just be a fashion designer, but he uses his considerable expertise in that field to capture beautiful imagery and symbolic costume design, and boy, it works.


Ford has birthed a film that’s dripping with grime but presented with gloss, creating an almost ugly beauty that’s visually fascinating. It’s a savage study of an intricate relationship, furnished with the bravado of a director that knows how to handle a script that’s jet-black in both themes and humour, and bolstered by a blistering score and vivid camerawork.

dahcjko,"Aaron Taylor Johnson was a good actor in this movie, can't say I saw that coming^^^/s

In all seriousness, the realism of a lot of the scenes *(ESPECIALLY the pull-over scene from the novel)* made it so much more tense. No insane bond/slasher villain plot. Just some crazy people you'd likely hear about in the news.

This movie just proves even further how much of an amazing actor Gyllenhaal is, alongside Adams, Shannon and I suppose Taylor-Johnson, of course. 

If I wasn't broke I'd see this movie again. A movie that really makes you feel for the characters, think about what it all meant and want more is a good movie in my opinion, and that's exactly how I felt afterwards. 

Only things I disliked: 

* I feel some specific details could have used more context, although this is just a very stupid pet peeve and doesn't reflect on the film as a whole. Also the movie can be very ambiguous at times, so it didn't bother me all that much.

* The intro just felt like it dragged on a fair bit, it's like someone that thinks everything is art, and won't shut up about it. Just felt unnecessarily ""graphic"" *(not that it was, but more that it wanted to be because EVERYTHING is art guys, look at these glasses for instance)*

db1v6zn,Michael Shannon was fantastic ,5exedm
db44rv9,"I think some people in this thread are missing some points that I want to explain. Again, this is speculation, but it makes sense to me.
The horrible thing that Susan did to Edward was leave him but ultimately, make him believe that she aborted his child. She in fact, did not have an abortion but never told Edward the kid was hers, which is in return just as horrible. Eventually, Edward finds this out and we know this because we see him drop off the package at her house, so he knows where she lives and has been keeping track of her all these years. 
The detective's character represents Edward. He mentions in the cafe that he is dying of lung cancer, but that he also has a daughter who he isn't really in contact with. Could this be Edward telling Susan that he knows it's his daughter and maybe even revealing that he himself has lung cancer? I think maybe there is a little bit of Edward in both Michael Shannon's character and Tony's. He wants to seek revenge on Susan so badly because of all the horrible things she's done to him, but ultimately knows that she is already unhappy and that any real revenge would end up hurting himself. It's a story about mourning the loss of a lover and a child. He has no contact with them and wishes, like Tony, that he had tried harder to hold on to that love.
Just my 2 cents.

dbw9c06,"So, my fiancé and I were discussing why Jake was double cast as the lead Tony/Edward and Amy Adams is not playing the wife in the story within the story. We decided that was very deliberate in that the wife in the story is Edward's ideal version of Susan. I also believe that Ray, the ringleader of the redneck gang, is actually the symbolic representation of what Susan has become, an abusive person who believes that he is not a man. His masculinity is called into question in a previous scene with him, where she marvels at how ""sensitive"" he is when he hears that her brother had a crush on him. Instead of responding with ""horror"" as many ""straight"" men might, he simply admits that he should call his friend. Later, she is walking with him and tries to soften the blow about breaking up with him, and she says he is wonderful and romantic and sensitive. He says that she says that he is ""weak."" He says that she has said it before. So, maybe he is projecting. Maybe Amy becomes her mother because the things Susan has loved becomes the things she hates. Either way, Ray becomes the embodiment of the emasculating Susan. So, in the story, he must exact revenge on the person who says the very worst emasculating things to him, including asking the ideal wife for a tampon for his bleeding nose, he is asked if she wears the pants in the family, he can't change a tire etc,. She may not have actually been abusing him in this way, but his perception of her is that she feels he is ""weak."" Ray has killed both his ""daughter"" and his idealized ""wife."" In the story, Edward gets the catharsis he needs by finally pulling the trigger, killing Ray, so that the ""weak"" Tony can finally die, (falling on his own sword) so that Edward can live. Now, he is truly the artist because of facing his fears and working it out through his art. ",5exedm
db2yu31,"I've seen people discussing how Susan's world (the ""real"" world) seems much more fake and romanticized than Edward's book, which I agree is true. 

On another note, though, I found it interesting that the film created tension and suspense in both the ""real"" world and within the story. In fact, there isn't really any suspense in the real world until Susan starts reading the manuscript, which is obviously very intense. From that point on, aided by the cutting and jumpscares, the real world is pervaded by a sense that something violent or dangerous is coming, largely because of Susan's reactions. 

The movie-within-a-movie creates a sense of tension and makes the real world feel like a thriller, despite the fact that nothing violent occurs in Susan's real world and we have no reason to expect that it will. This is fantastic meta-cinema, and I loved the ways it played with our interpretations of art, and especially with our tendancy to see ourselves within artwork. Great film",5exedm

  The way Tom Ford juxtaposed the the rich warm over saturated tones of the novel storyline against the muted drab grays of Susan's life were visually arresting, and a testament to his talent for telling a story through mise en scene.
  Michael Shannon, Michael Shannon, Michael Shannon. Will someone please give this guy a fucking Oscar already?

[Did Susan make herself believe that Edward was emailing her as a way to cope with the ""terrible thing"" she did to him? It's almost like she knew he wasn't going to show to dinner after she read the ending of the book. This can be seen and heard with the heartbeat slowing down and stopping to represent what she had done to him internally and emotionally. So getting the email in the middle of the night (while she was wide awake clearly thinking) was her way to try to ease her guilt. She did stay for an awfully long time, which was maybe a way to cling onto any chance of Edward showing which would mean automatic forgiveness from Edward. So with that being said, I personally think Edward sent her the book as a ""fuck you"" and never communicated with her in any other way whatsoever.](#spoiler)",5exedm

ddu9o9g,"Just saw this movie and would like to give my point of view.

After some thinking I believe that the characters in the novel reflects real-life characters in this way:

India = the aborted child

Tony = Susan

Isla = Edward

Bobby = Hutton

The three killers, or as I call them; the nocturnal animals = Susan's wealthy lives.

I think the poster implies that Tony and Susan is the same. 
When Tony meet Ray and the gang could be the same time as when Susan is trying to make Edward into something he isn't.  The death is Isla and India is to me the same as the abortion and also when Edward die inside from the realisation.
Sheriff Bobby turns up starting to help Tony just as Hutton shows his support in real life. 

Thing is that it leads to no good: the killers is killed one by one just as Susan's wealthy life is falling apart pieces by pieces. It turns out that Bobby has cancer, just as it turns out that Hutton is having an affair which leads to the death of Bobby and the death of Hutton's love for Susan.

Tony loses his wife and daughter, his support in Bobby and what killed his family. But he accidently shoots himself hunting them down.

Susan loses Edward and their daughter,  her husband and what took Edward and their daughter away (hunt for a wealthy life). In the same way she accidently shoots herself, left dead inside.

Anyone following me? It's late at night and I'm not used to express my thoughts like this in a foreign language, but I'm pretty sure this is. how I will look at this movie.

Fenomenal!

dbxjwgd,Was it me? Or was the soundtrack *really* inspired by the [Vertigo OST](https://youtu.be/kC5AzFc3coo?t=2m12s) at some points?,5exedm
dajol3v,"I enjoyed the movie a lot-- great visuals, strong performances all around, really nice use of silence to build tension. But I think I read it differently than some of you: to me, it wasn't about revenge as much as it was about author and audience.

I have a few reasons for thinking this: 

1. We only ever see Edward through Susan's eyes. We never meet him in reality and see how he really is, only how he's remembered by Susan and how she projects that memory of him into his own work. She thinks he wants revenge for the things she did to him, and that's what his work becomes about, because she is the reader.

2. [As soon as she starts reading the novel, Edward becomes the dad character, the daughter character looks enough like her daughter to warrant a phone call, and the wife character looks like her sort of, too. We infer that this is how he wrote the description of the characters, but I took it as her projecting their relationship onto characters in the book. Read like this, the events of the novel are a lot more about Susan's guilt over their split 19 years ago, rather than his festering hatred of her. She's a shallow person that made everything about her in their relationship (refusing to support his dreams, cheating on him/abortion with Armie Hammer), and now she's making his first great novel all about her, too. She assumes he's hung up on her because he never remarried, but she hasn't talked to him, she doesn't know. So much of the information we get in the film is filtered through her depressive/obsessive/romanticized viewpoint.](#spoiler)

3. The ending: Everything's been about her this whole time, so why stop now? [Doesn't matter where he is, she's reading it as his revenge on her, but he could've just gotten a flat tire somewhere, ironically. There's no indication that he meant anything more by delivering his manuscript to her than to show her that he finished a book other than what she reads into the situation.](#spoiler)

None of this invalidates her viewpoint, but it doesn't necessarily mean that was his intention.",5exedm

Also, [when she's speaking to her one of her staff about the REVENGE painting, she says she doesn't remember purchasing it.

When Edward says ""everyone only ever writes about themselves"" he could be talking about any character in the book. When Susan breaks up with him, there is a Pontiac GTO in the background, the same car that the gang is driving in the book.

The soundtrack and editing do a great job of building tension, the acting in incredible, and the narrative compellingly woven to make a story we've all seen and heard a thousand times feel new. Additionally you can't talk about this movie without giving Ford and the cinematography team love.

The 3 narratives are expertly woven together with great pacing and the choices made on when and how to cut away to another plotline is immaculate. Every performance in this film is full of subtle mannerisms and actions that really bring the characters to life with the stand out being Amy Adams who is magnificent. Also Aaron Taylor-Johnson deserves at least an Oscar nomination for his transformative performance. The cinematography is extremely impressive as the DP Seamus McGarvey has to shoot a bleak and stark neo-noir, a romance and a psychological thriller without the transitions being jarring and he pulls it off brilliantly. The narratives are gripping and the way they run parallel with each other using similar themes and events to convey how the main characters feel to the audience is masterful.

If it wasn’t for Michael Shannon and Jake Gyllenhaal  I’d be asleep during the whole film. The Amy Adams storyline is completely thankless, just a lot of mopey shots of her in beds and baths. The whole thing felt like a big pretty empty building, just a lot of shine over a very empty vessel. Ford is (to be expected) a gifted visual artist but that’s all this really amounted to, a visual art piece for a mediocre character study. Nothing about it felt original or fresh or interesting or engaging to me. To me this is what style over substance looks like. I’m sure there’s some interesting direction to be done on how the novel relates to Amy and Jake’s relationship, but I found every character so stock and uninteresting I seriously don’t care.

However, I found the storylines outside of the novel to be extremely melodramatic and uninteresting. [The amount of shots to Amy Adams crying over sweeping violin was borderline parody](#spoiler). Also, [the dinner scene between Adams and Gyllenhall had some of the worst expository dialogue I can remember](#spoiler). The opening credits scene was a misstep as well, I could hardly take the film seriously after that.

Everything in the movie felt it was supposed to leave you with raw negative emotions whether it was disgust, horror, sadness, pain, grief. I think they executed that well.

db05wk7,So who is the father of Amy Adams daughter?,5exedm
db2mszb,"I have an unconventional take on what the characters and ending in Edward's novel represent.

Tony Hastings & Family:

[To me, Tony Hastings doesn't represent Edward, but instead is meant to be Susan.  That means Laura Hastings is Edward, and India Hastings is the aborted child of Susan and Edward.  More reasoning on this in the next sections.](#spoiler)

The Ray Marcus gang:

[This is Susan's ""fate"".  I put fate in quotes because I don't believe it to be unavoidable destiny, with good judgement and strength it can be deterred.  Fate comes at Susan seemingly out of nowhere, just like Tony runs into it while driving down a straight road.  In the novel, Tony is too weak, fearful, and incapable of fighting off the gang.  Similar to how fate overpowers Susan when she is unwilling to work on her relationship with Edward or face her fear of becoming an actual artist rather than just a promoter.  Susan's mother even warned her it would happen eventually, that she would turn into what she used to despise.  When that prediction came true, it cost Susan a spouse and a child, much like Ray Marcus took Tony's spouse and child.](#spoiler)

Detective Andes:

[Detective Andes represents Susan's 2nd husband, Hutton.  Edward wrote Andes as an emotionless dying man, while Hutton turned out to be unfaithful and losing everything professionally.  Now, Edward didn't actually know Hutton, so creating an analogous character in Andes was either foresight or wishful thinking.  Either way, I feel they match.  Andes offered Tony a glimmer of hope during his tragedy, and Hutton did the same for Susan.   Andes promises revenge, Hutton lust/materialism, both of which are fleeting and ultimately unfulfilling.](#spoiler)

Ending:

[Tony eventually finds and takes out Ray, but it leaves him with no sight, no future, and so weak that he falls on his gun, killing himself.  Similarly, Susan pinpoints her ""fate"".  She hates her job, has an absent husband, and is losing grip on her life.  As desperate as Tony's attempt at vigilante justice, Susan sets a meeting with Edward, obviously with romantic intentions based on her dress/makeup.  After sadly waiting hours until it's clear he won't show, Susan sees absolutely no way forward (blinded), and the single tear down her cheek is her figurative death.  Life has now played out exactly as Edward wrote it.  The kicker in this theory is that early in their relationship, Susan complained that Edward was always writing about himself.](#spoiler)",5exedm

",5exedm
ddnhsk8,"It's pretty clear to me that the book never existed.  Susan, in her sleep-deprived state, concocted the story in her own head, and it was an exact parallel to her situation with Edward and its subsequent influence on her life.  It's very Wizard of Oz-esque in that sense.  I would guess that Edward killed himself years ago - perhaps accidentally, like in the story, via an overdose or something - or perhaps with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.  

Edward's revenge wasn't the authoring of this book; his revenge came when Susan finally realized how correct he was about everything, in that the life she chose to pursue proved to be one of emptiness and hollowness.  He was even correct about her having art inside of her (in the form of the story), although it took a horrible sequence of events to unearth it.  It turned out that Edward was her inspiration, as opposed to vice versa like she reads in the [imagined] note from Edward.  

In the story, Susan is represented by Ray.  I think the most telling reference is when Ray says something to the effect of, ""When someone accuses me of something, that gives me permission to do it.""  Well, Susan's mother told her that she was going to rip Edward's heart out, so she did it.  Just like in the story, she took away his wife (her) and their child.

The only think I'm a little loose on is the fact that I think Detective Andes represents Hutton.  He appeared to represent something (an embodiment of honorable law) different than what he actually was in real life , and he - through his immoral actions - helped Edward exact his ultimate revenge, just as Hutton - in a roundabout way - assisted Edward (by failing to make Susan happy in life).

My boyfriend (of 2 years) and I started to watch it a few days ago, but had to pause about halfway through because we were so exhausted. Two days later I broke up with him. It has been a long time coming and a very difficult thing for me to do. I am a single mom, busting ass to make ends meet, and he is a musician that just doesn't bring in any money.

This was obviously a campaign for Jake Gyllenhaal to win his Oscar after his Nightcrawler snub. He was fantastic as usual so I'm sure he'll get a nom. However, I was very surprised with Aaron Taylor Johnson. I only know him from Kickass, Avengers, and Godzilla and he's usually very wooden. However, he was so slimy and menacing and I felt guilty for being in awe of his character lol. 

But it really did feel like there was two different films going on which prevented me from caring about either character too much. I understand what he was going for but I felt Ford lost the message halfway through.

The moment of realization she has at the restaurant is her understanding this. But she doesn't leave to try to save Hutton because she knows he's been cheating on her. The novel tells Susan that Edward doesn't blame her for what happened, just as Tony's wife was in no way to blame, but that instead he solely blames Hutton and seeks his revenge, which he admits he is blinded by, on him. Tony's wife did not survive, so Edward does not expect his relationship with Susan to resume, but Edward, like Tony, wants very much to get his revenge on the person who took his wife away from him and ostensibly was the driving force behind the abortion - note Susan's line that she knew she would regret it, suggesting that Hutton encouraged her to go through with it](#spoiler)

Just got home from this film.

It was good. I'm just going to vomit out some of my random thoughts and observations:

Main themes: heteronormative and gender societal constructs, parent/child relationships, revenge

I'll start with what I thought the chief theme was: Gender roles and masculinity/femininity.
-Edward Sheffield exhibits a struggle with masculinity - it's revealed that in his childhood he lacked a father figure, he takes up creative writing as his education which is a feminine career, there's also this recurring discussion about him and weakness. He's not an archetypal male provider with his writing income causing Susan to leave him for a wealthier and seemingly more ""successful"" man who can provide. Hutton Morrow is tall, handsome, rich and successful. Armie Hammer excels in this character well but I can only imagine he's tired of playing this role: from gossip girl, to Winklevoss on the social network and now to Hutton Morrow. Hutton is a rich, handsome, masculine womanizing businessman. But his main claim to success, his business, is revealed to be failing. So beyond his appearance, he's emasculated. Sheffield's novel is his retribution and his medium of validation. He portrays himself in his novel which is important and meaningful. It allows him to define himself. He's seen as weak, not being able to sacrifice himself and protect his family from 3 nocturnal animals like a man should at the beginning. Some important imagery is when we see him in a flannel and ample facial hair, which are archetypes of masculinity, and in it he's pushed around by 3 guys and rendered defenseless and weak. Only after he loses his wife and daughter does the facial hair come off which mirrors his real life character - always depicted without facial hair or beard. The scene of Tony in the shower is an inflection point in this portrayal - it's the point where he washes those constructs away. Sheffield rejects the notion that he's weak, this is probably something he's struggled with his whole life trying to prove himself. Then his character, Tony, validates his masculinity and removes his ""weakness"" by killing his nemesis in a variation of a Texas standoff, the manliest duel. He then shoots his gun in the air in celebration and then promptly dies with a feeling of contentment. There's irony in that character death. The setting of Texas, acts as a great character foil and thematic foil. Texas is a state that embodies masculinity - from cowboy culture, to football, to guns, etc. Susan references her gay brother who has had to deal with a similar struggle. She admires her brother ""Cooper"" I think is his name and and once admired and respected Sheffield for those same traits. The 3 bad guys, were actually small in stature and juvenile and boyish in appearance yet they are the grotesque and inhuman men. This is Ford's meditation on what makes a man and what a man looks like - it's not the stereotypical Texas tough guy or rich man making business deals. It's a man who has the courage to believe in his craft, in his art, in himself. I bet Ford sees a lot of himself in his character. In fact Ford has childhood roots in Texas. Ford is also inspired by minimalism. The seminal art of Prada Marfa I think was an inspiration for the film and for Ford. Prada Marfa is a pop art sculpture replica of the famous and influential fashion house, Prada's, retail store situated in a obscure area near Marfa Texas alongside a vast middle-of-nowhere road. In such a desolate area devoid of the trappings of high culture, there's this exhibit of modern minimalist art, a Prada store. This tension and irony and dichotomy is kind of paralleled in the novel, Nocturnal Animals. Like A Single Man there's ample minimalism porn throughout the film. Minimalism is a great vessel to encapsulate Ford's discussion on his characters' relationships. The most masculine character we see is Detective Bobby and internally he's facing a battle with weakness and emasculation - he's dying of cancer but also he's lonely. He's without any family or love in his life and thus he's willing to risk it all. In critical moments, he's hacking up a cough and rendered defenseless - always relinquishing his gun, to Tony. Ford alludes to some social commentary with guns and how they apply to male culture and act as masculine security blankets if you will. In the movie they are used as tools to force opponents into submission, but they are tools that are depicted as defeated or overcome when the bad guys are able to escape. Also, it's really important how the trio of rapist murderers did not use a gun in their hijacking. It's unrealistic, especially in Texas, for none of them to be carrying, but the lack of gun or weapon is a meaningful void. Moreover, whenever one of the trio are isolated from a group, he's depicted as weak and defenseless. We first see Lou alone while he's arrested and in custody. We first see Ray Marcus alone when he's naked and vulnerable on a toilet. This is Ford's meditation on the grotesque and evil patriarchy which thrives only in numbers and as a collective. 

-I knew right of the bat this movie would center around gender/heteronormative deconstruction and their roles in relationships when we were early on introduced to a non-traditional relationship of a gay man married to a woman. It was a good foreshadowing of the Morrow relationship - these aren't relationships founded in love, they're symbiotic relationships - mutualistic, parasitic, and commensal. Susan Morrow faces this constant struggle between living an authentic life of love and then living an empty life of wealth and easiness. She's battling with gender norms. Her mother embodies female traditionalism - ""a man should be a provider of women."" It's easy to pick up on this dichotomy when Susan harps on about being practical and a realist. Notice also how the happiest and earliest depiction of Susan is her without makeup. Like beards and facial hair, makeup is another gendered archetype, but of femininity. The scene where she's reflecting on herself in the mirror and removes her typical makeup and lipstick and ""relaxes"" her look to be more authentic when she's getting ready to meet up with Edward again at the restaurant is powerful. She's hoping that this is her chance to feel a life of love and fulfillment again. She's removing superficiality and returning to authenticity and love - which she now lacks in her revealed unhappy life. Recall how when Susan's friend pointedly asks her if she loved Hutton. Conveniently, she escapes from the question.  Susan's biggest fear is turning into her mother. Throughout the movie we see this mother/daughter motif - with the two dead bodies laying next to each other, then quickly transitioned to the scene of Susan's daughter laying naked in the bed in the same position. I think Susan's biggest fear on the phone is that her daughter will be as unhappy as her - that her daughter would become her daughter's mother. However, Susan's daughter is obviously in love and speaks on the phone with a tone of happiness, comfort, and content which is juxtaposed to Susan's worried, scared and dreadful tone.  The mother/daughter dichotomy reaches a climactic point when Susan runs into her coworker who shows her a video feed of her baby daughter and becomes frightened from a horrific visualization. Susan Morrow is not in paradise. She's in sorrow with her relationship with Hutton and her closely similar surname reflects that. She's sad, lonely, not in love, and even sexless. She can't run from this *reality* of her life either. Which was alluded briefly in the beginning when she was unable to turn off the tv that was playing sex programming and talking about how cum had the consistency of coconut water. On the outside, Susan Morrow has it all, a nice house a handsome and rich husband, but there are now coconuts in Susan's ""paradise"" as the couple is going broke, sexless, and facing marriage difficulties. She longs to experience this idea of tropical paradise too as she begs to go to the beach with her husband who declines. Edward once told her when two people are in love they must try to make it work. She didn't believe in that then and now Susan is stuck in her own prison of not being in love or happy with a guy who she knows is cheating on her and trying to make it work. 

A lot of people in this thread are really focusing on revenge as a theme, and yes, it's a theme but I don't think it's the most important. There is deeper and richer meaning within Nocturnal Animals. 

Lastly, is the importance of the title. Obviously he 3 hijacker rapist murderers are nocturnal animals. But nocturnal animals applies more broadly to all humans - and is really a depiction of the human condition. We are animals, and at night we are nocturnal. Susan is a nocturnal animal plagued with nightmares, and unable to sleep. Edward is a nocturnal animal, writing  away his redemption novel. Detective Bobby is a nocturnal animal, lonely and savage. Hutton is a nocturnal animals always escaping away and having sex with women besides his wife. Ford really conveyed the animalistic side of humans.

The only gripe I have about Ford is that his techniques seem a little too filmschool studenty. He has visually stunning cinematography and a penchant for aesthetics and picture which is great but he uses techniques sometimes in too literal of a way. I had the same gripe about A Single Man. It needs to be more seamless and fit in with the whole production rather than come off as forced, contrived and hastily included. ",5exedm

The ""novel narrative"" was far more interesting than the ""main narrative"" which either ended up being annoying or just plain stupid. The acting for the most part was stale and the dialogue was mostly just clumsy. The only exceptions to those two come in the ""novel narrative"" which has some excellent performances by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Michael Shannon. 

Ultimately, it felt pretentious, clunky, badly paced, horribly edited and it really lacked in tone. I feel and sound like a douche, and a cinema snob (like the character) but I actually found myself sniggering and chuckling at the movie's dumbest or worst moments. For example, the jump-scare scene where Amy Adams is watching the baby monitor and Aaron Taylor-Johnson appears was a genuine eye-roller for me.

The critics who gave this movie such high ratings need to publicly apologize to movie goers everywhere for misleading them.

I'm warning you to skip this over hyped movie.,5exedm
dag2a2q,"""Nocturnal Animals"" is incredibly executed in bridging together the parallel storylines, a task that is especially impressive given the tonal/genre shifts from story to story, to how the separate plots are paced out individually, as well as intercut with each other.
The acting is exactly what you; complete believability that is immersive, in particular order the stand outs are Michael Shannon, Jake Gyllenhaal, Aaron Taylor Johnson and Amy Adams. I reluctantly place Mrs. Adams on the end of my list, knowing full well that this may have more to do the with the restrictions put on her character Susan (from a writing stand point) whereas the other actors are given more scenes that have a lot more meat to chew on.
Micheal Shannon, will probably be a favorite to win best supporting actor and Gyllenhaal most certainly deserves a nomination for best male lead. Both of these actors, consistently give it their all in bringing a character to life and this film is exemplary of that. Shannon's dry delivery and no nonsense demeanor became a well placed reservoir of dark humor throughout the film. Gyllenhaal, smartly knew how to infuse his multiple characters with the vulnerable indignation (for one role) and a helpless anger (for that other) that lived in harmony, thanks in addition, to the deft story structure. I've only seen Aaron Taylor Johnson in Kick Ass, but if I had any doubts about this ability to be terrify and psychotic in a role, than I'm gladly eating my hat now.
The film was shot in 35mm and looked spectacular, with a very specific esthetic that was based in commercial photography (during the Amy Adams sequences) that sometimes made me feel like I was a vintage perfume ad from 90's (I mean that in the best way possible!). When the film switched over to the thriller storyline, Ford and crew (DP Seamus McGarvey lensed ""The Avengers"") were just as confident in capturing the impotent dread one may feel in desolate locations far removed from ""civil"" society. The editing as well was at times, deliberate (re: slow) and calculated, sparingly snapping to quick cutaway at a few keys moments for devastating effect. The clever use of continuity editing (a gesture begins in one shot and ends in the next shot) to help the transitions from the parallel storylines---and the repetition of some very basic blocking with different characters (as simple as that may sound) had an incredibly playful effect to me, especially when it turn that technique on its head to undermined the viewers expectation.
Since this is a film by Tom Ford; this short note wouldn't be complete without a few words on the makeup and wardrobe. The makeup/hair extensions used to make Adams and Gyllenhaal look 20 years younger (along with the help of some digital effects clean up) look flawless. The wardrobe choices for Adams gallery curator, stood out the most (some for their beauty, others for their gaudiness)--along with her work/social colleagues, but isn't that what you'd expect from high society art elitists?
Final analysis: For me, the film takes as it muse the heartbreak of loss and how that emotion can manifest in our lives or be repressed in some cases, and how making ""art"" out of that loss--can help both cases come to an undeniable understanding.
I'd recommend this film if you're a fan of the following films: ""Adaptation"" by Spike Jonze, ""Synecdoche, New York "" by Charlie Kaufman, ""Twenty Nine Palms"" by Bruno Dumont, ""Breakdown"" with Kurt Russell and anything with a splash of Hitchcock and a pinch of David Lynch and a dash of Wong Kar Wai.

dgv747s,"WARNING: LONG POST.

I heard that Tom Ford originally planned to make TWO films based on the book ""Tony and Susan"" (the book that this film is adapted from). The first would be faithful to the book, while the second would deviate from it. 

Now, if you read the book, you might have trouble figuring out if this film was meant to be the faithful adaptation or the deviated adaptation, as the basic story is the same while the setting is dramatically different. Here are some differences between the book and the film:

[spoiler text here](#""-The book takes place in 1989-90. The film takes place in 2015-16.
-The flashback sequences take place in the 1960s in the book. In the movie, they take place in the 1990s.
-In the book, Tony's family is murdered in Pennsylvania while traveling to Maine. In the movie, they are murdered while in Texas, traveling to another part of the state. 
-In the book, Susan's husband is named Arnold. In the movie, he is named Hutton.
-In the book, Tony's daughter is named Helen. In the movie, she is named India.
-In the movie, we don't get to see Bobby Andes' family, despite him mentioning having a daughter living in Corpus Christi. In the book, we meet his ex-wife Ingrid and his cousin Susan. Both of those women are present when Andes arrests Ray and Lou, and kills the latter (which happens at Ingrid's house, not Bobby's).
-There are additional subplots that are in the book but have been left out in the movie. These include Tony having an affair with one of his students after Laura is killed, multiple flashback sequences involving Laura and Helen in better times, and a considerably different flashback sequence involving Edward and Susan that includes Arnold's mentally unstable first wife (who at one point attempts to murder Susan) and Susan NOT aborting Edwards child (the child doesn't even exist).
-The book has a different ending than the movie. In the book, Susan decides to continue to pursue Edward even after he stands he up, and sends another note to him. In the movie, we don't see what she does after she's stood up."")

That being said, it's a damn shame that Ford abandoned his two-film plan. Because there NEEDS to be a sequel to this. There are three ways that I can picture a sequel for this film working.

1) It can be a prequel involving Bobby Andes. It can further develop who is arguably the most interesting character in the first film. It can answer unanswered questions about him (such as, ""Why does he not seem to care about his family when he mentions them?"" or ""What has he witnessed in the police department that has convinced him that the system is too corrupt for him to prosecute Ray the legal way?"" or better yet ""Out of all the cases where he saw killers go free, why did he choose Tony's case to resort to vigilante justice? Perhaps there is something that he didn't tell Tony? Perhaps he and Laura already knew each other prior to her being killed?""

2) It can be a midquel that involves the emotional stress Edward goes through while writing his book. Perhaps it can involve him communicating with the characters in his book as if they were ghosts appearing in his house, giving him different pieces of advice on how to handle the possibility of Susan coming back in his life.

3) It can be a combination of 1 and 2.

That is not why I am posting, I am posting because I am confused by how Tony died.

He shoots a round loudly into the air, then falls on the ground and rolls over on the gun, but there is no second gunshot.

Or there would be a wide shot moving down a hallway, then a cut in to the same angle but closer, then a cut back to wide all within a few seconds.

Parts of it really reminded me of the infamous Liam Neeson fence jump.

Other than that, it was a decent guilty pleasure type mystery. A mix of Cormac McCarthy, David Lynch and Refn. The only major complaint I have other than the editing is that I found the ""book""'s story in the film much more compelling than Amy Adam's storyline.

The execution, however, I thought was off. It seemed like Ford didn't really know how to connect the two other than the fact the book was written to hurt Susan. The parallels between them were more vague than they ought to have been. There's further disconnect in that the book story is much more gripping than the ""present"" story so switching between them was often jarring and mood killing.

Many things were left unclear, it may have been intentional but that doesn't always make it ok. What became of Susan's husband? Why had she recently redeveloped problems sleeping? Why were the book daughter and wife played by different actresses? What is the significance of the term nocturnal animals? The fact it was a pet name for Susan shouldn't be why it's the title of the movie.

Then there's the weak ending: So he stands her up...ok? That's your revenge plan? To go out of your way to stand someone up whom you haven't spoken to in 19 years? She'll go home and forget about it soon enough and that's that. There's another interpretation that he kills himself and that's why he didn't show. I like this one because it adds more gravity to an otherwise weak ending. But if Edward did kill himself why did he write Tony's death as an accident?

i3ux8qk,"I thought this was an amazing film.  I was struck by the way Tom Ford took us on this journey of human drama and pain.  My interpretations vary a bit from others.  I think he masterfully pulled us along with Susan on this reliving of her past crimes and how we see her begin to sympathize with Edward/Tony throughout the tragedy of the novel, connecting dots of her own life with the characters Edward created. Realizing she's made many mistakes.   In the end, we see her completely sympathetically breathing along with Edward/Tony as he breathes his last breath.  But Ford didn't stop there, he brought her all the way, through the final betrayal, being abandoned by Edward, not just that night, but you get the sense, in life.  And I was captivated by that final look on Susan's face when she realized, she wasn't Tony, she wasn't the wife or the daughter, she was Ray Marcus, the killer.  She had no right to pretend to empathize with Edward.  She had no right to expect him to invite her back into his life.  Edward shows us how he felt about Susan's betrayal when Ray says he killed them because he just has a thing about the way people talk to him- a strange expectation of refinement from a man who craps in the open on his porch.   The vacuous reasoning of a filthy soul.  I think Edward expected a higher humanity from Susan and was devastated to find she was someone who could cheat on him and abort his baby without even consulting him.  The final act of revenge is precipitated by her initial act of violence.  There could be no resolution with Edward/Tony, as a result of the chain of human violence started by Susan/Ray, everyone must metaphorically die, as in the novel, including any dreams of love and happiness.  Susan got what she worked hard to produce... nothingness.

Michael Shannon is awesome to watch.  Especially when I consider I first saw him in Groundhog Day.   As Edward/Tony's conscience, he's compelling.  The devil on Tony's shoulder.  In spite of how sick he is, how destroyed he's become by a long career of watching evil escape justice, he's going to carry through this one act of vengeance with Tony.  An assist for all time, but the final act belongs to Edward/Tony.

Just like in the book how he died when he brought closure to his wife being murdered. spoiler text here](#spoiler)",5exedm
dbquov5,"I don’t know if I agree with the interpretation that Edward sought some kind of revenge against Susan. [One factor we must consider here is that we---as the viewer---do not have the luxury of actually reading what Edward wrote. While I suppose one could disagree, the movie suggests we are watching Susan’s visualization of what Edward wrote. There is various evidence of this including that jump scare. I initially thought it was a stupid scene until I realized that the jump scare “villain” is also Ray.](#spoiler)

[So if she is seeing the same character in both real life and her visualization, it suggests that everything we see is filtered through Susan’s eyes. For example, we see Tony’s wife and daughter as being red haired. But the movie doesn’t give us much clues on whether Edward wrote them as being red haired or if Susan is visualizing them that way because of her past with Edward. Similarly, we see that the same actor plays both Tony and Edward---but is that what Edward intended, or is that because that’s how Susan visualizes Tony? Perhaps Susan visualizes Tony that way based on how Edward’s past work (which apparently featured himself as the main protagonist in an obvious way). In fact, I think Tom Ford leaves a strong clue that Edward didn’t necessarily intend Tony to be his exact copy since his letter to Susan states that this book is “different than the kind of things that I was writing when we were together.”](#spoiler)

[One thing I notice about the movie is that we know virtually nothing about Edward in the most recent time line. We know that he finally finished a book and that a publisher agreed to publish it. We know that he wrote two messages to Susan: one in the initial letter, and the other in the email that we wrote. We know that he dedicated the book to Susan and that he credits her being the inspiration. Finally, we have a general sense of what the story is although we are not entirely sure what he actually wrote since we are experiencing his book through the eyes of Susan. For example, we see that Edward and Tony are played by the same actor and that Tony’s wife/daughter looks similar to Susan. But we are not entirely sure if that is what Edward intended or if that’s how Susan is visualizing the book that her ex-husband wrote---especially in light of her actions 19 years ago.](#spoiler)

[For what it’s worth, what Tom Ford said about the ending somewhat suggests that the entire movie is really about Susan. It’s about how she interprets, visualizes, and processes what Edward wrote to figure out why he credits her for the book. I don’t know if she figures out what Edward is trying to say in the book, but she recognizes that she still has feelings for him and that she must get out of the life she currently lives in:](#spoiler)

[*Does he not show up as an act of revenge, or does he not show up because he just literally can’t face her? [The ending] seems the correct conclusion to me, because she falls in love with him again through reading [the novel]. She is liberated, by the way, at the end. This has been painful. She’s taken those rings off. She’s wiped off that lipstick, and she is not going back to that life. We don’t know what the next chapter is for her, but [the previous] chapter is over.*](#spoiler)

[I think above is very interesting since Tom correctly suggests that there is nothing in the movie that really tells us why Edward doesn’t show up. We can interpret his absence as him having a sinister motive and that he did so as an act of revenge. Or perhaps we believe that he is still “weak” and that he cannot stomach trying to see Susan again. Perhaps we believe that Edward decided to kill himself---similar to how Tony dies in the Book. We can also imagine much more mundane reasons: maybe he overslept or maybe he got into a car accident on his way to the restaurant.](#spoiler)

[What’s makes this more interesting is that all of our guesses and theories of what happened with Edward are most likely what is crossing Susan’s mind as she realizes that Edward is not coming. And while I initially thought that the ending was weak, it basically bolsters the idea that the entire movie is really about Susan and her trying to cope with what she did to Edward. For all we know, Edward has made with peace with Susan and only had good intentions in reaching out to Susan. But Susan has no way of knowing his true intent. And we---as the viewer who sees everything through her eyes---cannot be sure of his intent either.](#spoiler) 

[Along similar lines, we must also consider that Edward most likely didn’t write this book just for Susan. While we don’t get the full story, his initial letter suggests that the book was “good enough” that a publisher decided to publish it. We don’t if it’s going to be the next Harry Potter or another forgotten fiction, but presumably it had a broad enough appeal that a publisher thought it would sell to the general public. And I’m going to guess that the general public would have no idea who Susan is or how the story in the book relates to what happened between Edward and Susan. This again suggests to me that many of the details we see on the screen are not necessarily what Edward intended, but how Susan interprets and visualizes his book.](#spoiler) 

[This fact also should influence how we interpret the various symbols we see in the movie. For example, the movie shows Susan suddenly re-noticing the “Revenge Painting.” We could view this as  a some what blatant suggestion that what we are watching is a revenge story. But consider it from Susan’s perspective. She just received a book from her ex-husband who cut off all communication for 19 years. He dedicates the book to her and write that she was the inspiration for the book. If we were in her situation, we would be reading the book trying to figure out how exactly we inspired this story---ultimately trying to figure out if Edward is trying to convey a message. In midst of all this, she re-notices the “Revenge Painting.” According to the other character, Susan bought the painting herself but forgot about until she starts reading Edward’s book. This suggests to me that Susan is considering the possibility that Edward seeks revenge against her.](#spoiler) 

[But is there any good evidence that Edward is in fact seeking revenge? I personally don’t think so. I think Susan feels guilty about what she's done to Edward. She thus cannot escape considering the possibility that Edward is seeking revenge against her. Yet again I do not see any evidence that Edward in fact intends to do so (although I would be interested to see what other’s think to see if I missed anything).](#spoiler) 

[On a somewhat related note, it’s interesting to think about whether Edward did in fact write a “good book” and found success. Recall that while Susan is unhappy with Hutton, there is also no guarantee that she would've been happy with Edward. She does appear to fall in love with him by the end, but it's unclear if she actually loves him or if she is again seeking an escape from her unhappiness. 19 years ago, she thought Hutton would make her happy. 19 years later, she now thinks perhaps Edward would make her happy. While many of us are romantics at heart, is there any reason for us to believe that she would be happy in either relationship?](#spoiler) 

[Now perhaps Susan would be happy with Edward if he became a successful writer who finds financial success as well. But do we know that's the case? We know a publisher will publish the book, but we don’t necessarily know if it is a major publisher or a small one. We can also expect that a reader will not necessarily share our emotions that we felt watching the movie since they don’t have the benefit of seeing Susan’s current life and her past. When I try to imagine the book on its own, I kind of picture a revenge story similar to a Tarantino story but lacking that cathartic moment where the protagonist returns the brutality towards the villain. Would such a story work without that cathartic moment of revenge?](#spoiler) 

[So if you want a really depressing take on what actually happened, one can interpret that Edward actually wrote a mediocre book. Susan is emotionally touched by it not because of the quality of writing, but because of her past and lingering feelings for her ex-husband. If so, perhaps Susan’s mother (and to an extent Susan) was right that while Edward is a sweet guy, he ultimately wouldn’t find success as a writer. And if so, we may guess that even if Edward came to the restaurant and Susan found temporary happiness, Susan will again find herself unhappy.](#spoiler)",5exedm

daz4a5v,"[I see the book (in the movie) as a cathartic tale. The dedication to Susan, the letter saying she gave him the strength to write it (by utterly wrecking his fucking life). It's all there. Edward is Tony. The horrible shit that happens to Tony's family is a conduit for Edwards pain. And the devastating way in which it ends says to me ""this is what I live and will die with."" There's no escaping grief for Tony, as there is no escaping grief for Edward, I think. It was brutal and honest. Which is probably what rekindles Susan's love for him. In her life of superficiality and unintended consequences, here there is this visceral reminder of the honesty she experienced with Edward. I think there was significance in her removing her lipstick before she went to her meeting with Edward. It said to me that she wanted to let go of all the shallowness, and to me it really says that yes, she did reply, and they did agree to meet. There's so much in this movie that is delivered through subtext. I think the crashing realization of how empty her life is comes at the end, when she finally realizes that he's not coming. That the chance passed her by all those years ago, when she left Edward in the first place. That, like Tony, she should have done more. She should have tried to do more.](#spoiler)",5exedm

dduajci,"I can see that you've put a lot of thought in this movie and would like to offer my point of view and see if you think I might be on to something.

Could it be that this is what the characters in the novel represent;

Tony = Susan
Isla = Edward
India = aborted child 
Bobby = Hutton
3×killers = The wealthy life

If this is true it would make sense that Tony isn't driven so much by revenge. Just as he hunts the ones who murdered his family, Susan hunts the wealthy life. The hunt eventually kills the gang, and Susan is losing her highlife. 
Bobby offers support when Tony's family is dead.
Hutton offers support after the abortion, same time as Edward dies inside realising about the abortion.
Bobby turns out to have cancer which will lead to his death hence leaving Tony.
Hutton turns out to have an affair which will lead to a divorce hence leaving Susan.
The hunt for the killers leads Tony to accidently shooting himself.
The hunt for wealth and fame leads to Susan realising the life she chose only led to her dying inside.

Therefore, Edward is not showing up at the end. Because he left her life a long time ago when Susan decided to live the life she lives. 
Just as Isla died along time ago when Ray and his gang entered Tony's life.

I have a feeling those hilariously melodramatic moments were intentional... there's no way he heard all of that incredibly grandiose, soap-opera style music in some of those scenes and didn't know exactly what he was doing. It's meant to be comedic.

I think he was doing something really interesting by making the supposed 'real world' of the movie really film-y and melodramatic, while the 'fake/novel world' is actually far more 'realistic' and natural in tone.

1) [Susan lied to Hutton as well and he has been raising her under the assumption that she is his, which would still be as horrible if not more than the abortion.](#spoiler)

2) [Hutton knows Susan did not go through with the abortion and is knowingly raising Edwards baby, which i highly doubt since what motive would he have to pretend to raise a child that isn't his?](#spoiler)

The reason i don't think either of those scenarios is likely is that flashback scene of Hutton and Susan in the car. That whole scene to me was pretty clear cut that [she just came back from the abortion, Hutton was there to console her and drive her home, then they see Edward in front of the car because he was going to try and stop her from aborting their child.

It's like I had to sit there and be reminded that Amy Adams hated her life over and over in order for the novel to continually be advanced. The novel was captivating and very tense, but any time it switched back to the past or current Amy, I was just bored. The dialogue wasn't interesting at all to me. I don't have a problem with the story or how things ended, but man, I just really didn't care at all about Amy's character. I actually like how the movie ended and how she didn't get to erase her mistake just because she realized she was unhappy (again) and shouldn't have left Jake's character.

Having said that, Jake Gyllenhaal had something beautiful to say about that ending. I originally read it as nihilistic and tough. However, he said that his character gave Susan a gift, releasing her from her fears and her worst self. That's something to think about.

Breakups are hard, but they might be for the best. Relationships need a lot more than love, so you did the right thing. It's OK to be sad and it's OK to still feel love for a guy.

[The reason Gyllenhal plays both Edward and Tony is that he is once again writing himself, as Susan complained in the flashback.  In the story, Tony loses his (redhead) wife and daughter because he's too ""weak"" to stop the attack.  Similarly Edward loses his wife and (unborn) child because he was too ""weak"".  By the end of Tony's story he's chased down Ray, and gained the strength to confront and kill him.  Likewise, Edward gained the strength to confront Susan- by proving his strength as a writer, sending her the book dedicated to her, and as a man that's not going to take her back.](#spoiler)

I agree. Enjoyed the movie thoroughly, but this was one of my big gripes. They had Amy Adams basically just be sad, regretful, and cynical of the world she built around herself. The ""losing her mind"" narrative was interesting, but wasn't fleshed out beyond some characters commenting on her lack of sleep, a single jumpscare, and her not paying attention to what other people are saying. Then the whole idea sort of melted away and she just was sad and lonely again.

     [I think standing Susan up was just a ""fuck you"" from Edward. She was left sitting there by herself, going over her entire life and all the mistakes she had made.

Removing the lipstick demonstrated that she was making the decision to leave the artsy part of her life behind her and go back to how she was when Edward wanted her, and obviously the removed ring was to make her look single because after reading the book she realizes she wants him back.    
    While she is sitting there waiting for him to show up, there is a close up on her face. During the close up, we hear a hostess tell a man she will escort him to his seat. Susan is so excited that she doesn't even look. She is full of hope an anticipation that it is Edward. When the man is seated at another table we see her give a small glance and an embarrassed smile.

darure7,"If you are referring to the opening credits - they symbolically represent the entire film. After the credits end, we see that these dancing women are part of an art installation - which Amy Adams later refers to as ""junk art."" This is important.


The ""Nocturnal Animals"" book that she reads is a work of art within the context of the film. However, it really is a piece of junk art itself. It is a pretty derivative story, and a lot of the characters feel like they popped out of some shitty true crime novel that you'd buy at a grocery store. However, Amy Adams still finds herself deeply affected by it. Why? It's about framing.


As a gallery owner, Amy Adams recognizes the power of context. Take an ordinary piece of work, put it up in a high-end gallery, and suddenly it becomes art. She explicitly says this during the film. 


>""We'll get some cheap LA artists nobody's ever heard of and people will think we're ahead of the curve""


Just as important as the work of art is the context in which it is presented. That gives the meaning. In the movie, Amy Adams' life and memories are the ""frame"" of the Nocturnal Animals book. This is a really clever play by Ford, using the narrative ""framing device"" as a literal frame. Within the context of her remembering her relationship with Jake Gyllenhaal, this piece of ""junk"" affects her deeply and becomes art.



This brings us back to the opening credits. Much like Gyllenhaal's book, they put ugly Americana on full display. Flag waving, fireworks, obesity - these are all stereotypes associated with America (and specifically rural America). Similarly, Gyllenhaal's character's story takes place in rural Texas, an area romanticized in the classic American westerns. The rapist bumpkins, the no-nonsense detective, the ordinary man taking justice into his own hands - these are all classic American narrative beats.



When the camera zooms out and we see that these dancing women are actually pieces in a gallery, it is Ford suggesting that the film will primarily deal with examining this classic ""junk"" Americana within the realm of high art through recontextualizing it in a gallery space.",5exedm

She let her mother get in her head which is why she started resenting Edward and why she chose the ""equal"" man who could provide for him. The genuine Susan never really died as a personality considering how she found herself in an unhappy time in her life where she yearned back for Edward and how she admitted to her colleague that she doesn't care about the art in the slightest.

But the movie is also about broken dreams, lost hopes and how we also lie to ourselves about who we are and what we want. And that there are not always second chances. Sometimes when you blow it, you have blown it forever and there's nothing you can do about. 
I don't think one viewing really can do it with this movie because you don't know what to pay close attention to until you've seen it all the way through and can then go back and see all the cues and hints that you missed. [For example, when Susan is breaking up with Edward and he's trying to convince her not to, right behind him is the same kind of car that the baddies drive when they knock them off the road earlier in the movie (obvious symbolism for the breakup before the death of their relationship and unborn daughter).](#spoiler)",5exedm

>What became of Susan's husband?

I didn't feel like this was important. he was an avenue to explain her misery.

>Why had she recently redeveloped problems sleeping?

Again, I think this point was just to emphasize her unhappiness with her life and her choices, intensified by Edward's reappearance.

>Why were the book daughter and wife played by different actresses?

I believe that this choice was very intentional. While Gyllenhaal's characters (Edward and Tony) were supposed to be equivalent to each other, Susan wasn't directly represented by the wife in the story. Isla Fisher was portraying Edward's idea version of Susan. Her best qualities. However, she was also represented in the story by the men who stole Tony's wife and child away from him. So not having Amy Adams play the wife was indicating that she isn't simply a casualty and a victim in Edward's story.

>What is the significance of the term nocturnal animals?

I took it as something that was chosen both because it relates to both narratives and because it's simply a catchy title. It relates to real life because it's what Edward called Susan (and they are the central relationship of the film), and it also relates to the narrative of the book because you could say that the men who pulled them over are nocturnal animals. They are ""nocturnal"" because they committed their crime at night, and ""animals"" because their crimes required an inhuman amount of empathy.

>So he stands her up...ok? That's your revenge plan? To go out of your way to stand someone up whom you haven't spoken to in 19 years? 

I'd disagree on this one as well. I think it was ambiguous as to whether Edward was planning on standing her up or whether he simply couldn't bring himself to go. On the one hand, this could've been her revenge because he knew that she would understand the significance of the novel. It was written to remind her of what she took from him and to emphasize the anger and grief that he had been holding on to. Standing her up forced her to sit and reflect on it. On the other hand, he may have been very nervous and simply not had the nerve to go, but it still had the same impact on her. I didn't really get the suicide impression, but I could've missed something.

>She'll go home and forget about it soon enough and that's that.

The other points are my personal interpretations/opinions, but this is the one point on which I'll say you are flat out incorrect. I think you misunderstood something about Susan's characterization here. It's made very clear that she still has strong feelings for Edward and that she regrets leaving him. She certainly won't forget about it.

Anyway, most of that is just personal opinion but perhaps this can provide you with another perspective on the film. I personally found it very gripping and I found the characters to be fascinating. I loved the layering of the narratives and the way that they played on each other without being too heavy handed. But to each his own.",5exedm

Then we look at the world that Edward wrote - dirty, raw, violent. Very unglamorous. But you'll also notice how the dialogue is much more realistic, how the emotions are much stronger. The world edward has written is much more real than her own.

And so it's with irony that Susan calls him a romantic, and herself a realist, while she slowly becomes part of the surreal world that is ""art"". 

Her having the abortion is the final straw. It's her complete and total rejection of the real world that she can be in if she stays with Edward. So when she tries to reconnect with him in the end, and he doesnt come - she's lost her chance. She's stuck in this fantasy land doing a job she hates surrounded by people who don't love her (her husband) or people simply trying to cope (her artist friend with the gay husband). 

It's pretty consistent with Ford's previous movie ""A Single Man"", which also explores people creating something that isn't real. The main character, every morning ""creates himself"", the man everyone else knows him as. Tom Ford talked about feeling the exact same way.

So when in the novel Gyllenhaal's character is dead, the old Edward is 'dead' too (physically or not, it is up for debate), meaning that he's finally over with this relationship. We can see this as a revenge of Edward's also, where he knows after reading the novel Susan will fall back in love with him, but he's done, and I think Tom Ford is very clear about this.

In any case, there are like 3-4 times in the movie where they focus on Tony wearing the crucifix and then immediately cut to Susan in the real world clutching her identical crucifix.](#spoiler). 

Originally i thought [Edward = Tony, until his wife gets killed, then the perspective switches to Susan = Tony for the rest of the book](#spoiler) because i was focusing on [Edward being described as weak. It's mentioned a few times in the movie and as i was watching it, i kept thinking that the first scene of the book is meant to show how weak he was during the relationship, that he couldn't do anything to save them/save the relationship with Susan. Then my friend pointed out that it's only the mother who mentions he is weak, and she is talking about how she consoled him when his parents died (which would understandably make someone ""weak/weaker"") and could see that quality in him. Then Susan in turn says it to Edward later in the movie. Yet from what we see (even though the whole movie is from her perspective), like /u/steamhawk mentioned, he is the one switching careers to focus on something he is passionate about, he is the one pushing her to follow her creative side and he is the one fighting for the relationship. Susan is always the weak person throughout the movie.](#spoiler)

This movie man. I went from loving the acting but hating the ending, to not hating the ending but wishing it showed more, to obsessing over every detail of this movie 24 hrs after having seen it and now i fully accept the ending because they really did give you all the answers within the movie.

It's not really that difficult of a movie to decipher, in my opinion, as the whole sleep deprivation angle serves a bumper lane to help the audience construe the metaphor. There are many things that we were shown is Susan's ""real life"" that were merely figments of her imagination.  Communication with Edward was one of those things.  I also do not think the daughter she called actually exists.  She was shown in a foggy/clouded frame, thereby insinuating she was some sort of dream or other vision (i.e. Susan may have been thinking of what she would be doing if she hadn't had the abortion, etc.).  

Assuming Edward is dead is far from a great assumption.  Everything in the book ran parallel to Susan's situation with him, and he died in the book.  He's dead, and it was by his own hand, with a large assist from Ray/Susan.

As for the dinner, it is something she is doing out of self-loathing.  Among the many emotions and mental states she experiences throughout the film, guilt is near the top of the hierarchy, and this dinner (along with remaining with her current husband and turning a blind eye to his overt affairs, as well as some of the art work she has chosen to display) are ways she punishes herself, mostly subconsciously.

daqfcxg,"It was shot and edited very pretentiously, there were a lot of artsy-looking shots like the opening sequence, the dinner scenes and the flashback scenes. They placed a lot of emphasis on micro-features as if they were smart and not ridiculously heavy-handed. Oh look at how Amy Adams' mother is dressed, doesn't she seem emotionally cold and isn't this conveyed as much as possible instead of allowing a better performance to carry this message to the audience?

As for the pacing, there are so many strange cuts in the film and overlong shots that it gets kind of annoying. The ending is an exact embodiment of this.

The tone? You had them try to mix in a melodramatic romance, a domestic drama, some horror and a full-blown thriller and the result is something that doesn't make the audience feel anything. The jump scare scene where Amy Adams is watching the baby monitor does not fit in with the rest of the scene and this destroys the sense of tone the scene was trying to create. Moreover, I never really felt anything except for in the thriller narrative. I'm not sure if I was meant to be unsettled or unnerved during the real-world narratives. They were trying to tell the audience they're supposed to be shocked or feeling empathy towards real-world Jake Gyllenhaal but this was so predictably done that I was really just waiting for it to happen. I just felt bored and numb because of how dull the movie was. 

I should also say that everything was shot and edited in the exact same way and it seemed very plain. There was a bit of shaky-cam during the kidnapping scene, a few quick cuts and close-ups here and there to make the fighting ""intense"" and that's where the differences end.

He found success in the midst of her discontent and is ""above"" her, so to speak. I doubt he was pacing the floor, scratching his hair thinking ""Oh, what if she doesn't like me? Better not go."" He either stood her up and was planning do so for the whole time or he decided last minute he didn't care enough but I 
doubt he was nervous.

>The other points are my personal interpretations/opinions, but this is the one point on which I'll say you are flat out incorrect. I think you misunderstood something about Susan's characterization here. It's made very clear that she still has strong feelings for Edward and that she regrets leaving him. She certainly won't forget about it.

""If you are referring to the opening credits - they symbolically represent the entire film. After the credits end, we see that these dancing women are part of an art installation - which Amy Adams later refers to as ""junk art."" This is important.

The ""Nocturnal Animals"" book that she reads is a work of art within the context of the film. However, it really is a piece of junk art itself. It is a pretty derivative story, and a lot of the characters feel like they popped out of some shitty true crime novel that you'd buy at a grocery store. However, Amy Adams still finds herself deeply affected by it. Why? It's about framing.

As a gallery owner, Amy Adams recognizes the power of context. Take an ordinary piece of work, put it up in a high-end gallery, and suddenly it becomes art. She explicitly says this during the film.

""We'll get some cheap LA artists nobody's ever heard of and people will think we're ahead of the curve""

Just as important as the work of art is the context in which it is presented. That gives the meaning. In the movie, Amy Adams' life and memories are the ""frame"" of the Nocturnal Animals book. This is a really clever play by Ford, using the narrative ""framing device"" as a literal frame. Within the context of her remembering her relationship with Jake Gyllenhaal, this piece of ""junk"" affects her deeply and becomes art.

This brings us back to the opening credits. Much like Gyllenhaal's book, they put ugly Americana on full display. Flag waving, fireworks, obesity - these are all stereotypes associated with America (and specifically rural America). Similarly, Gyllenhaal's character's story takes place in rural Texas, an area romanticized in the classic American westerns. The rapist bumpkins, the no-nonsense detective, the ordinary man taking justice into his own hands - these are all classic American narrative beats.

When the camera zooms out and we see that these dancing women are actually pieces in a gallery, it is Ford suggesting that the film will primarily deal with examining this classic ""junk"" Americana within the realm of high art through recontextualizing it in a gallery space.""",5exedm

dahqaw8,"I see your point on the first part and I definitely think it's more likely that he planned it. 

As for the second, you are correct that rejection eventually fades, and maybe it will for Susan, but her relationship with Edward was much deeper than just being rejected by someone you have feelings for. He was the love of her life and she destroyed him. Then she turned into everything that she never wanted to be because of it. He had proven to her that she ruined her entire life based on her actions and now she was forced to live with that. Maybe over the years the pain would've faded, but I doubt that it'd be any time soon. ",5exedm
dak3yo8,"The end scene shows Susan finally getting it. Throughout the whole movie her understanding is very cerebral or intellectual. She has emotion but doesn't quite ""get it"". The way she openly talks to the woman at work shows this too.

In the end scene she has two realisations. The first in close up shows she realises he is most likely not turning up, Susan's face shows slight humiliation as her intellectual ego is still in play. The second is the extreme close up that shows she has finally ""got it"" not just on an intellectual level. So I don't believe she will just get over it, this was the final nail that most likely will change her and being stood up will stick with her for that reason.

The other point about Edward looking like Tony but Susan not looking like Laura tells me Susan isn't getting quite yet that the book is about her, thus she dissociates, we see in flashback that she criticises Edward for writing about himself, so it isn't hard to believe she would assume from the character description that Tony is Edward, but she is yet to realise Laura is her. Once she does realise it, Laura is no longer seen.",5exedm

His novel, while metaphorical for his experience, was sad yet full of romanticism, which is exactly what her life lacked, once more. In the end she was just being selfish again and putting her own expectations far above anyone else's, especially with the removal of her wedding ring. No sympathy here. ",5exedm

Susan's extreme depression >I just posted a much more meandering interpretation of this movie along these lines-- I think Ford makes sure to cue us into the fact that we are seeing things colored by Susan's POV enough in the movie to cause us to question it.  It ends up feeling like we are watching her anticipate Edward enacting a revenge on her, but ultimately, she engages in self-sabatoge because of her fear of it.

I wasn't really surprised by the fact that this was only his second film. After all, there are tons of directors even in recent years who go through the film school system and end up making insanely good first/second films (Jeremy Saulnier, Damien Chazelle and Ryan Coogler, to name just three of many). 

What does surprise me about Ford is that he didn't come out of that world, he came out of the fashion world (after having studied architecture of all things), where he was also incredibly successful. The idea that he can jump to film seemingly out of nowhere and just slam-dunk it is astonishing to me, and I can only assume he's one of the most gifted creative minds alive.

dascohl,"At first I thought it was kind of over the top too--until (perhaps just reading too much into the film), I took a different possible take on the ending, and then considered that actually the revenge painting wasn't necessarily there to hit us over the head about it being a revenge story, but to show us that a lot more was going on here about Susan's perception--the painting on the wall first seems over the top, like it's foreshadowing, but then we learn that she bought the painting.  But you could read it not as if she brought the revenge on herself, but that she is in her mind, for all these years, expecting a revenge.  Perhaps the painting is intended to show the massive role that her looming expectation for revenge, actually has on her perception. The film makes it clear that Susan feels that she had done something horrible and brutal to Edward--she discusses it this way with her friend.  And we do indeed see that it was perhaps shallow and cruel in someways, but not inhuman exactly.  She's expecting revenge, since before she started even reading the book.  And then standing in front of the painting she bought, she again, scares the shit out of her self in the jumpscare scene.  Ray isn't really there.  Nobody is really coming after her.  It's in her head.  We are drawn at many other parts to the relevance of the way her own perception is coloring things-- we see the obese women at the biker bar, the likeness of tony and his wife and daughter's characters, etc. 

This could hint at a different reading of the ending than the obvious one--- Edward seems totally fine to meet with her.  But Susan has been freaking herself out... we don't actually see her reply to him.  We don't see her make plans.  I mean, it almost seems totally outrageous of her, to choose that immensely fancy restaurant, to meet with the down to earth sensitive fella who she tossed by the wayside in her youth, because he could't provide her with that type of life.  We never see them make the plan.  And while she looks to the door, and kind of has a look of longing on her face when we hear someone being directed to their table-- we never see her check her phone, to see if he's texted, even though phone technology is integrated into the film--she doesn't look here.  We never see her glance down at her table to check her phone.  Is it possible that we see her actually choose the loneliness of her fancy life (the restaurant), over the fear she has worked up in herself regarding Edward wanting revenge, because she feels she deserves it and has for a time before even ever receiving the novel?   When confronted with Edward and what he represents to her and what she lost, due to her anxiety and fear of what it means to be giving up on this bougie $$$ debutante life?  Is she sabotaging her own life and fulfillment, once again, while feeling the pangs of nostalgia when we see her glancing at the door, but still choosing that empty shallow life?  

One gets the feeling, almost, as if Edward's novel actually dispenses us of the notion that there is any benefit to revenge.  Tony loses his family and in pursuit of revenge and then actually acquiring it, gains nothing, becomes blind, and dies.  ",5exedm

de8bufc,"That might have been someone else. I thought the movie was 9/10. It describes my ex and dealing with him for years in a way that no one ever has in real life or movies. I would be the real life version of Jake Gyllenhaal in the movie (vs the character he wrote in the book). 

Also, I was the last comment in that thread I sent you. Sent the whole thread so you could see what I was responding to.",5exedm
de35pqv,It is. Edward drives the same mercedes as Tony in the book. And Susan broke up with Edward right next to a GTO like the one the bad guys drove.,5exedm
daz2b4a,"Yes that's what I was trying to say! Sorry for all the errors in my post, I can't use mobile phones very well. Didn't mean for the quote of your comment to be in there! ",5exedm
daz2hdj,"If you are a writer, you probably know the feeling of not only imagining the perfect novel, but imagining how writing it would change your life (eg. People realising you're a genius or ex girlfriends realising they were wrong about you.) ",5exedm
daz2mcc,"So I guess in summary, I think this movie isn't an exploration of the effects that Susan's past has had on her, but rather the fantasy of a man who experienced heartbreak at the hands of susan. ",5exedm
ddhb4f6,"She was definitely older than 18, she's gotta be at least 20 or 21, old enough to fit the timeline",5exedm
dcj4cwl,"It's not inexplicable. The entire movie was playing out about how his character died due to her actions.

He dedicates the book to her as it's his metamorphosis, and then leaves her at the restaurant because she needs to learn once you let go of love, you may never get it again.",5exedm
dcani5x,"I agree with the 'building up to something spectacular' because there were subtle things throughout the film that hinted at some dramatic twist, eg like her assistant and current husband not remembering/knowing susan's ex husband",5exedm
dc79lk1,"> What disappointed me was the movie felt like it was building up to something spectacular, and instead it fizzled out and left me with blueballs. I felt like Amy Adams sitting at that table waiting for something that didn't show :)

That's how I felt too and I thought that was intentional. ",5exedm
dc5oje9,Upvotes all around for polite discussion!,5exedm
df7jb76,What I was saying was that you were trying to argue that the movie can't be interpreted. Which obviously is ridiculous. ,5exedm
daggk3i,"...Only that she has a great big throbbing talent that any man would be jealous of, even Fassbender.",5exedm
dedilsi,Exactly.,5exedm
df8tz0z,No the daughter she called is Edward. She is the killers. What she did to him was how the killer did in the book. ,5exedm
daiq2fs,">Yeh I didn't know she was in the movie but when I saw her name in the opening credits I got SO EXCITED. Then was so disappointed at that scene.

Same here.

>In the jump scare it looked like Ray (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) to me. 

Oh, it was him?  That somehow makes it even worse.",5exedm
dax0ws2,[deleted],5exedm
daz75dh,"I mean yeah. The book symbolized how the death of his daughter and wife (abortion and leaving for another man) left him dead inside. The book wasn't about closure, he wrote it with all that context and symbolism to make her feel like shit and at the end of it when she feels the need to talk to him as a cherry on the top he denies that need for her.",5exedm
idnfb0s,"Holy shit, a 5-year necro and *that* is all you have to add?  

I forgot about this movie, tbh. Dude driving around in BFE, Texas without a firearm in his car. Sucks to suck.",5exedm
de4udnj,"Interesting aint it. Susan and the child both died in the story because he was weak. Just the way Susan killed their relationship because of that, including the abortion. The parallels are amazing, keep finding more and more.",5exedm
df378nr,"Well spotted, regarding the GTO.",5exedm
dg5iorr,I disagree. She could easily have been late 17ish...early 18ish and in college. But I still think she wasn't real.,5exedm
dg2b6fi,"Parts of movies can be interpreted when there are ambiguous elements. The book being real isn't ambiguous at all. There's absolutely nothing point towards that conclusion. Your comment is the ridiculous one. No one is saying you can't interpret things at all, but when you're just flat out denying something fundamental then it's just lunacy.

Might as well say there's no gravity in the film, or the characters aren't biologically human.",5exedm
dahbpyh,They both have a girthy body of work.,5exedm
daitw76,">Oh, it was him? That somehow makes it even worse.

Yeh because she has never even seen Ray before! His image is just a figment of her imagination!",5exedm
day331p,"It is pretty sad then, that she chose that restaurant and approached the dinner in such a shallow way. Although i guess you could make the case then that even if she did arrange to meet with edward, it was still an act of her trying to choose that shallow materialistic life again--but this time with her thinking now edward could provide it.  I just felt like she didnt come around to seeing the light in the end... she was still that same person who ditched the guy who saw the best in her and she refused the see the best in him as worth her time.  

Im perhaps reluctant to see it as an act of revenge because his novel didnt really portray revenge as something worth seeking. And also--the life susan ended up with was revenge enough (like you said her husband is cheating on her and her life's financial situation is unstable and she finds her work meaningless). Edward didnt need to stand her up.  And its also hard for me to see edward as holding a grudge for 19 years.  Susan obviously wasnt good enough for him. 19 years later it seems petty to stand her up, somehow?  I guess i didnt see much in his character (though we only saw his character through susan and the novel) to suggest he was petty or vengeful.  

I agree that there are things that arent explained if he didnt actually stand her up. I just think when you choose one explanation that resolves some questions seem to lead to other things feeling unsatisfactorily resolved. ",5exedm
daz7tnx,"> The book wasn't about closure

that's even more petty",5exedm
idnfu9t,didnt know there was a time limit on movie threads🤷🏻‍♀️,5exedm
dajzydu,"I don't understand what you mean ""she's never even seen Ray before"" he isn't real and neither is the image she sees on the baby monitor. It is more likely an indication that the images from the book are getting to her and seeping into her real life. Ray looks the way Susan imagines him based on Edward's description in the book, which we never hear. Sorry if I am dense but your comment makes no sense to me.",5exedm
daj224q,Exactly!,5exedm
dak25t8,"Yeah so that's what I meant. Ray isn't real so she's never seen him before. But she sees *something* in the baby monitor. We know it's not real, it's in her head. Except her image of Ray is just based off of words, it's not like there's a drawing or a picture of him in the manuscript. Think of the last time you read a book. Even though you imagine the characters, it's not like your imagination is so vivid that the characters might pop out and give you a jump scare.

It would have been more believable if it was Jake Gyllenhaal scaring her, either as Edward or Tony. It still doesn't make logical sense, but at least that is a face she actually knows and has seen, so it would make more sense that she would see his face and get frightened.

Hope that explains what I meant.",5exedm
dax10r1,[deleted],5exedm
dan0m7q,"Okay I get what you mean now, thanks for the explanation. I would say though that the descriptions in the book must be vivid enough that it scared her into calling her daughter, and the image in the baby monitor doesn't 100% look like Ray, it was hard to tell, so it fits your idea that one wouldn't get a clear picture from a book. Though I am on board with the scene being out of place. That whole sequence from the revenge painting to the baby monitor is weak and out of place. Even the meeting is just odd as well, I get what Ford was doing, I just don't really like it that much.",5exedm
