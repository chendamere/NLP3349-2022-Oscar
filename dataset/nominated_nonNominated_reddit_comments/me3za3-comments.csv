gsdep8v,"Bob Odenkirk, Christopher Lloyd, and RZA are probably the strangest action combo I can think of.",me3za3
gsdrd8r,"It’s going to be hard to beat this movie. 

It’s John Wick for the tired working class. It throws realism out of the window, and replaces it with hilariously over the top spectacle and set to a better score somehow. Odenkirk is father of the year. 

It’s like the perfect “mediocre” movie, but it does everything better than what came before. It’s violent, stylish, there’s even some brutal gore. Don’t even get me started on the comedic timing. It’s amazing. Not mediocre at all. 

There is no: “all hope is lost moment” everytime you settle in for the familiar it says: “fuck it” and has more fun. Tropes are introduced but cast aside. It never stops. It’s just great. 

Didn’t know what to expect, but with the intro I assumed it would be soooo subpar. I was very wrong. What a great movie to return to theaters for. Watch it. Watch it twice.",me3za3
gsdvqk9,"Finally, a fight that is actually anything but one-sided. That fight on the bus was amazing. Nice to see how limited space can’t keep one from getting hit, no matter how skilled he is. He was punched, stabbed, kicked, and thrown out of a window. Nice to see the hero take some damage for a change.",me3za3
gsdjgbq,I loved the final sequence. RZA's triple headshot was great as well as when he shot the rifle backwards over his shoulder and let the recoil hit the guy in front of him.,me3za3
gsde8jx,"Loved this movie. Went in not knowing or expecting anything, got an incredible action thriller that left me feeling exhilarated. Really hope a ton of people watch and enjoy it

gsdg4q0,It started out as John Wick and ended up as Home Alone.,me3za3
gsdudhw,"RZA's sniper beatdown was epic. I loved that recoil hit.

It was really quite creative for what I expected to be a John Wick copy- I might even prefer this. Also, Yulian's dancing was pretty fun.",me3za3
gsdsoz5,"This was a lot of fun. I think it works better when it's just Odenkirk brutally beating dudes to a pulp, where all you can hear are the punches and groans and whimpers, (that bus scene got me giddy in a way an action scene hasn't in quite some time) and it falters a bit with the more fast paced gunplay stuff towards the end. Christopher Lloyd is absolutely hilarious though.

Odenkirk has proved that he's a more charismatic and cooler action star than most acting today. Really would love to see him do more work like this.",me3za3
gsdhi97,This movie is fucking awesome. Christopher Lloyd's character was amazing. Bob Odenkirk and RZA killed as well. I need a sequel.,me3za3
gsdga9y,"Michael Ironsides got big, I couldn’t understand Christopher Lloyd, that fight on the bus was awesome and I want a Nobody John Wick team up movie.",me3za3
gsk6hq8,That scene where Christopher Lloyd's character pretended to be asleep when the thugs got into his nursing home room but was ready with the shotgun was pretty awesome!,me3za3

Also I feel like the triple headshot had a very call of duty esque vibe to it. Loved it!",me3za3
gse4xog,"Saw it tonight, enjoyed it a lot. Bob and the other cast are awesome.

Also, the timing's perfect, 1,5  hours went pretty quickly.

As a Russian, also liked to see real Russian actors (their looks, with no accent, real funny speech, etc). Not sure if Americans can tell the difference - let me know, please if it was easier to believe them in comparison to 'fake bad Russians in other movies.",me3za3
gsdqsj3,Great flick!  The only question I have is that if Bob Odenkirk is supposed to be a redacted superspy then why did he have a tattoo on his wrist that was easily recognizable to the Vietnam Veteran?,me3za3
gsdjo87,I’m never going to look at a kitty cat bracelet the same way again,me3za3

gsvlmus,"My girlfriend yelled, ""Not the Lasagna "" and it made the movie for me!",me3za3
gsdjnby,Just came out of a drive in showing. Holy moly was this a monster of a movie. Nice sequel setup. Odenkirk was killing it all throughout. Missed big crowdpleasers like these.,me3za3
gsqekbi,When he’s got the wire wrapped around the dudes neck on the bus and every time he punches them the “stop requested” sign lights up. Comedy gold,me3za3
gsdwrwn,Holy shit I never thought I would picture Bob Odenkirk and Christopher Lloyd as complete badasses. A very welcome surprise. This movie was the tits man. Action with some subtle comedy. Odenkirk is a savage man. I hope they make a follow up of this film. Really good shit. Dad Wick is so much fun.,me3za3
gsdbr15,Just saw it tonight. Thought Bob Odenkirk played a great action star. Hope they make more,me3za3
gsddjws,"Overall solid and fun movie. I thought there was a tonal shift halfway through where it did not feel like it knew where it was going. I think the final showdown could have been executed better in terms of understanding where everyone is and not having the cliche back to back shooting. That is my only critique. Overall, solid 8",me3za3

gsym4sq,"Breaking Bad Call Backs:

Pizza Box in the Garage/Pizza on the Roof duality

Broken Plates

Automated Guns

Breakfast with the family.

His origin story is basically Mike's Half Measure's story with a twist.",me3za3
gse1l2b,"The antagonist, Yulian, was definitely the victim. Hutch braindeaths Yulian's son in a fight Hutch purposely escalated. Violence was reciprocated onto Hutch and his family. The Barber gives Hutch intel that Yulian wants out. Hutch guarantees Yulian's demise by burning the Russian mob's cash and taunts him, luring him and his organization to their deaths. Yulian even tells him they could have worked it out if Hutch hadn't burned the mob's money. Hutch wanted to feel alive again by committing a massacre. And he nearly got his wife, children, father, and brother killed for no good reason. Damn.

Very entertaining, though.",me3za3
gut8hod,"lot's of comparison's to John Wick, especially among critics (and, I know, some of the same pedigree; the screenwriter; Daniel Bernhardt) but if you want to reflect on the difference between these two films in terms of action-comic vocabulary, just picture Wick strapping a @#$@$ claymore to a riot shield and charging his arch nemesis and pulling the pin...

...or picture Hutch walking, looking dapper, in slow motion up to his final kill and just shooting him, like Wick does with Theon.

Both things don't quite work, do they?  John Wick's action isn't any more or less ridiculous yet entertaining, but it's different; Wick is stoic and elegant, where Hutch is a legit bloodthirsty madman with some real sadism to work out.   There's sensual glee in some of Hutch's kills.  He's horny for it.  Wick may have been as well, but it's under the surface.  This makes Nobody more acerbic and weird, even more of a guilty pleasure.  Both films are cut from the same cloth, but quite different in the end...",me3za3
gsve6yn,"The ending was done very poorly in my opinion. The first half of the movie was spectacular, especially the bus and home invasion scene. However, the ending felt like an over played power trip. When the father and brother showed it, it felt like it was a comedic parody on a john wick like movie, instead of a fleshed out action scene. Its an ok watch, would give it 8/10",me3za3
gshkqrb,"My wife and I saw it yesterday and we absolutely loved it. I’ve been a long time fan of Bob Odenkirk and he’s so great in it. He really sells playing a broken, beaten, subservient man with a secret past. The action is great. The violence is a riot. Christopher Lloyd and the RZA are great supporting cast. Overall the movie is fucking fun.",me3za3

guvh552,"Really love how they did a reversal of the broken mirror reflection trope. There's broken glass but you see Hutch's reflection unbroken.

gsdpobd,"I loved it. I expected a silly fun action movie and I got that, but more! Bob Odenkirk did great and I appreciated that the movie didn’t take itself too seriously and just had fun with the action scenes and humor. I would definitely watch again and I would be down to see a sequel.

Plus, the cinematography was really cool too. Some interesting camerawork",me3za3

gsr49cw,"I scrolled through this whole thread and only found 2 comments that disliked it. Damn...

I found this movie to be excruciatingly painful to sit through. If we’re comparing it to John Wick, those movies are so self aware of themselves. This movie was...not? It played itself so seriously, but yet had these weird comedic moments that weren’t earned and didn’t even make any sense. 

The 3 of them were able to take out DOZENS of villains effortlessly, but all of sudden the main baddie comes in armed with JUST a gun...and the 3 ran out of bullets THEN?!?!? REALLY??? I mean I understand movie logic, but no. 

This was TRASH writing in every single way!!!!! How are people defending this film? I know the pandemic has our choices limited, but sheesh!!  

To end on a positive note, I loved the beginning showing his mundane life, I liked the home invasion and him doing “nothing” to save his family. I can even fuck with everything up until the bus scene. That was fun. But as soon as the main villain gets introduced, it fell downhill fast.  

I enjoyed the character of the dad. And even the random (adopted and just used so they could have a badass person of color in an otherwise white washed movie?) brother was a fun addition to the last 10 minutes. 

Also the scene of him using the rear view mirror in the car was just eye rollingly stupid.",me3za3

gsk1f2t,[deleted],me3za3
gse8oqo,I liked the first half of the movie with the semi realistic gore and fight scenes. But once the evil Russian guy shows up the movie feels more like a live action cartoon. The Russian is way too over the top evil and the fights lose all the suspense once Hutch becomes an unkillable superhero who can wipe out hundreds of men without getting injured besides some scratches.,me3za3

gsix3bu,"Fun flick! If you liked the commercials and trailer, you will like the movie. I read some of the negative reviews, and they were pretty much garbage. If you walk into this movie looking for depth and deep characters with lots of soul searching, you are either an idiot or never did your homework. This is a fun action/comedy, goes by really fast and has some creative fight scenes. 8 out of 10",me3za3
gsdpun4,"Loved this movie. It was really fun, well paced, had an entertaining story, awesome action scenes. Can't wait to watch it again.",me3za3

gsgevng,What was supposed to be in the truck that RZA and Lloyd were looking at at the very end? I think I missed something there,me3za3
gshqu2c,"Wow, a lot of praise for this movie. I thought it was pretty terrible. At least in terms of writing, characters and plot. It's perfectly fine as a bloody shoot'em up, but it fails everywhere else. The characters are paper thin, especially the villain. Odenkirk plays against type as a walking cliche. It lacks any real stakes or drive. Characters make either stupid or nonsensical decisions throughout, just to make those parts of the movie happen. This is a poorly written John Wick copycat.

All that being said, if this film had tipped just a bit into actually being a parody, it could have been pretty great.",me3za3
gundmsr,"The best part of the movie was the little girl.

gsdk50r,"I wish this was in the same universe as John Wick. I know not everything needs to be connected, but it would be a fun story. John Wick was apart of the Russian mob, a prequel story could have been his impossible task to kill Nobody after his rampage decimated the mob. A movie with both these guys trying to outwit each other so john could get his freedom.",me3za3

gu4illk,"I really love this movie. None of Hutch's family and friends were killed and that was a nice change. There also wasn't any sexual content which was a nice change of pace too. It seems that most movies in this genre have someone close to the protagonist get murdered and/or sexual content. Sometimes, it's just nice to see people get their asses beat. The entire cast was great and the cinematography was great too. A sequel would be fine, but I feel like it would also be fine to leave it as only one movie. I would reccomend this to anyone who is a fan of action.",me3za3

gso2jzg,"Best way I can describe the movie is ""what John Wick wanted to be"", really.

It's just a much more polished movie with less holes and a better understanding of what it is. They balanced the action and the humor perfectly. Also, thanks to Naishuller, the Russians in the movie aren't caricatures.

Really enjoyed it overall! I'd rate it 5/5 as an action, and 4/5 as a movie. It just nails everything it set out to do and doesn't leave any loose threads, even if it's not ""movie of the year"" material or whatever.",me3za3
guyt5ms,"Are there any good writers left in Hollywood? Any at all?

First thing first, why does the movie start with a flash forward? Why would you do that in a movie where the story *already* is as pre-ordained as they come? Are they trying to get rid of every last bit of suspense? The movie sabotages itself in the first 10 seconds. Now you know not only that the character is gonna survive, but also that he's not just a regular Joe. Which ruins the whole first third of the movie because it's just time spent waiting until the character reveals himself to be a bad-ass - which you already know for a fact. Contrast that with a better crafted movie - like History of Violence for example - where you are unsure until the final act whether the main character is a former bad-ass, or if it's just a misunderstanding. 

And really, what is it with this fantasy where a guy is living a quiet suburban life and then some shit happens and it turns out that he is actually a TERMINATOR? Oh, sorry, an AUDITOR. It's a film equivalent of a youtube video titled ""My tuned Supra EMBARRASSES a cocky guy in a Ferrari!"" Once the ""bombshell"" reveal is out, where do you go from there? It's an one act play where the narrative development is always gonna stink and serve only as a paper thin setup for all the action you really want to do - but for which you were too lazy or incompetent to come up with an actual story.

Now, at this point, many of you might say that you don't really care about how shit the story is, you are here for the action. To this I must reply: how very demanding of you, be careful for your standards to not fall through the center of the Earth. But ok, let's discuss the action. Which, oopsie-daisy, is also shit. Funny how your lack of good storytelling principles happens to ruin *everything*, isn't it?

Well, sure, the choreography might be good. The special effects might be good. But that's a very small part of an action scene. I might as well have watched a video of some martial artists sparring, or behind the scenes footage of some dudes practicing and got the same thing out of it. What elevates a movie fight scene beyond just watching people going through the practiced moves, is that it forces you to put yourself in the shoes of the protagonist, it puts you right in the middle of it as if it was an actual thing happening to you in real life. In other words it again - as it always does - comes to immersion. And you know what doesn't help with immersion? You know what doesn't help with making you care about what happens? It's when the main character doesn't care. It's when the main character doesn't care and the movie has already told you that he is gonna be fine by the end no matter what.

If the main character doesn't care if he's gonna get hurt or killed, then why should you care? And how would you care if you know that he won't? I see that a lot of you thought the bus fight scene was brilliant. Well, I don't think it was *brilliant*. It was competently shot and the choreography and the special effects were decent, I will give it that. But because it was completely divorced from cause and effect, from reality if you will, it was also nothing but self-serving choreography. Completely boring. The whole setup with a bunch of assholes just happening to come by when the protagonist feels like blowing off some steam, and then fighting until they are literally unable to instead of trying to get out or cool it off - tedious. Just to make that scene happen, the world is suddenly full of crazy coincidences and suicidal, masochistic psychopaths instead of actual humans. Oh, sorry, just to make *about every scene* in this god damn movie happen. 

By the end it's devolved to a point where it's not really as much the protagonists fighting baddies, as it is extras running like brainless puppets to a spot where they will get their head blown off. Fuck me, what a suspenseful movie. Real gravitas to every scene. It's all really just a meaningless commotion, wasted energy at best, isn't it. Fight isn't just a fight, it's an extreme (and undesired, last resort) conclusion to an existing tension. That's when it is at its most gripping, effective and when the conclusion is the most enjoyable. When the stakes were at their highest. It's not just fireworks and people flailing arms around. It's not a joke, even in a movie with jokes.

Speaking of which - as a last thing to say, I promise - the movie doesn't really know how to marry violence and humor. Or rather, it can't. And that again has to do with the movie and with every individual scene being narratively fucked. You could have dark humor - but dark humor comes as a short burst of relief when in a situation that weighs heavily on you. As we know, the movie has none of that so that option is out. Or you could have comic over the top humor where you intentionally amplify whatever reaction a character might have, or whatever violence there is beyond what a reasonable expectation would be. The movie sort of tries that, but it doesn't work because it's applied inconsistently. In some scenes, it's over the top, in most others the movie tries to present itself as if it was some grounded and ""gritty"" action flick. If you are gonna go for over the top, then it has to be consistently over the top so you know that's the base line. If it's not the base line, then - from the point of the normal base line where people behave like people would - it's just characters randomly behaving crazy for no reason. Which, really, is the opposite of funny.",me3za3
gsdz0gi,"Now I wanna see a movie with Jon Bernthal from Punisher, Charlie Cox from Daredevil, Matt Damon from Bourne, Bob Odenkirk from this, Keanu Reeves from Wick, Jason Statham from Transporter, Daniel Craig from Bond, Vin Diesel from Knock Around Guys, Dwayne Johnson from Walking Tall, Josh Brolin from Oldboy, Tom Hardy from Bronson, Tom Cruise from Jack Teacher, Wes Bently from Yellowstone, Liev Schriber from Ray Donovan, Chris Meloni from Marauders, Mark Wahlberg from Shooter, and Brad Pitt from Snatch, to name a few.",me3za3
gshisnr,"I definitely had fun watching Nobody but there are some caveats.  First of all, it is straight up a John Wick copycat (yes, I'm aware it's the same writer), so it's mostly predictable apart from the occasional small deviation from the formula. I would have appreciated more creativity instead of just mostly doing what we've seen before. I was half expecting Wick to show up at the end like Nick Fury in Iron Man. 

Second, while I think there was mostly a good balanced between silly and serious aspects, I think it occasionally went just a bit too far and became straight up goofy. Like the scene with Christopher Lloyd in the retirement home taking out the two goons, to me that's a perfect balance - campy but not completely over the top. But then at the end when he's walking around with 19 shotguns and killing guys left and right, it's goofy. Also there's not a ton of tension in that scene since most of the bad guys just sort of run into frame to die, usually they don't even have their guns up. 

Third, while I do think the shorter runtime worked in the movies favour, I kind of wish the assault on the Russian mob bank or whatever was a full scene. I'm sure it was a budget thing to turn that into a montage instead though. 

Basically this is John Wick: Bob Odenkirk Edition, except they start the humour at John Wick 3 level. I'd give it a 7.5/10, this will be the perfect streaming movie when it eventually gets there (silly move to make this theatres only right now but whatever).",me3za3

The whole motivation/confrontation stemming from the bus Fight seemed so meh and tacked on, Russians Mob a la Wick... again? Oh and he saves a Cat at the end? Really? oh wow, a 'Save The Cat' nod, how very clever. I dunno half way through it just became a slog that lost a lot of its potential with the whole angry mob feeling so tacked on. Atleast John wick had Avant Garde Action Spectacle that offset the basic script and motivations. This film kinda wanted to be that John Wick Action and be 'something more' with the Family/Self Respect angle, but in the end it ditched both those objectives it seems. Those goofy talking to dying people explaining his expostion was so ffffking lazy. I guess its all in service to set up for a sequel? cryptic phone call teaser, oh no, he's an assasin again... idc, i wanted to see his relationship evolve with his daughter. The whole film should have been 'weird', I thought it would evoke a bit of the black comedy/morality like in ""The Art of Self-Defense"", instead it meanders and squanders its apparent potential by not being sure what its really about.

meh.

Oth, Great to see Bob on the big screen though, hope he gets more dramatic/dark comedy roles, dude's great.

h7q68wu,"Three things I noticed on rewatch:

One, Hutch wanted out of his situation just as much as Yulian did. It's just that Hutch wanted to go back to The Life.

Two, the inciting incident with the kitty cat bracelet was complete bullshit. Hutch wanted out, and grabbed at the first half-assed excuse to go ""audit"" someone. He didn't do any prep work or recon. He didn't even wait for his emotions to subside. He just went out to fuck someone up in the most half-assed way possible. It worked out in the end, but that's only because that's exactly how he hoped it would go. This is mirrored in the third act, when he offers Yulian a peaceful resolution. But he hopes Yulian won't take the offer. And he pretty much does everything he can to make it impossible for Yulian to just let it go and walk away.

Three, that scene in the police interrogation room, there's a moment where all the props come together to make him look like a classic Evil Mastermind. He's sitting there, smoking a cigarette, petting his cat, his fine art masterpiece at his side.",me3za3

Like yeah they were drunk assholes who crashed a car but they didn’t even start to say anything to woman so him going off on them isn’t really justified from a writing standpoint


Everything after that is just consequences for him doing something he wasn’t required to do

If this came out, say, pre-pandemic it's probably closer to a 5/10 but still plenty of really good action and the humor, for me, mostly hit. Never thought I'd see Saul Goodman as a lead in an action movie but he held his own",me3za3
gveyd5c,"It was decent but everyone is sucking it off and refuse to criticize the rip off of John wick. There were a lot of jumps between events, for example, he goes from not knowing who the russian guy is despite the fact he is a high level, undercover/covert, special op, federal agent (retired), to knowing exactly where he hides his money, which is in his own fucking town mind you. Not to mention the fact that there's the scene with him at the barber. Who dafuq is that supposed to be, Laurence fishburne from John wick? And his wife when she comes out of the basement and finds blood, guns, bullet holes, men in black masks, and dead bodies everywhere and all she does is act about as surprised as someone at a surprise birthday party. And then she nonchalantly tells him something along the lines of complete it/come back. 

The fight scenes and gunfights were cool but that's about it. Pretty original in terms of creativity in this aspect. The old man was cool too.

Sure, he can roll around with the bad guys and knows his guns, but there's no reason he can survive the house ambush the way he did when John Wick was Jiu Jitsu-ing up and down his house.

Everything is sheer luck with this guy and apparently he's the Terminator. His wife, who acts like a civilian the whole time suddenly superglues his stab wound and then reverts back to Stepford Wife mode.

And the last act was a joke. You can't bring the Doc and Wu-Tang your way out of an attack like that. All three should have died. The ""people who worked on John Wick"" need to stop branching out and work on John Wick 4 and 5.",me3za3

Also I wanted the garbage cans to pay off ha. Glad he stole his neighbors car. From the trailer it seemed like the whole thing was about the kids bracelet. I feel like it would have been more funny if he took down a mob because they stole his kids bracelet rather than part of what tips him back to his true self. But overall really good!,me3za3
guzeoov,"John Wick was the action film of the 2010s. Nobody will be the one to beat in the 2020s, and I think it even beats Mr. Wick.

Also,

# Cast Bob Odenkirk 

If you put him in law abiding citizen, you could take a 6.5 movie into the 8's.",me3za3
gv6doze,"This was *a lot* better than I expected. Both before watching the movie and in the first quarter where I was actively disliking it because of the messy tone (really didn't find everyone giving him shit about not fighting armed burglars-from his son, to wife, to co-worker, to even the cops that showed up at the scene of the crime believable), meh writing, lack of a fleshed out world like John Wick, and Odenkirk not really pulling off the bad-ass vibe with his acting. 

Things totally ramped up in the best way possible though. Main conflict was well crafted and even retroactively fixed the shortcomings of the opening scenes; it started nailing the bad-ass scenes better; good, stylistic lore and imagery introduced with Russian mob network, his friend in hiding he only communicates with through radio, the Barber, etc.; awesome sidekicks in the form of Christopher Lloyd and RZA, etc.  

All in all some of the aspects of JW that it tries to emulate still fall a bit short of being done in the same vein that would justify a crossover between the two series which they are apparently considering, both you can definitely feel how the director of Hardcore Henry blends a separate creativity into the mix-especially with the action sequences. The climax was a pretty spectacular bloodbath action sequence, though I was a bit on the fence about the borderline cheesiness of all the traps that the enemies perfectly fell into; it's one of those things that is fun to see but at the same time eventually feels more like you're watching a YouTube video or action reel or something than a movie. 

The comedy was arguably the best part of this action film. Got a good laugh of the recurring gag with people wanting out ASAP the moment they found out who he really was, that shot of the guy in the hospital simply holding up his metro card to ID him tuned perfectly to Tchaikovsky's ""Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor"", the Llyod-RZA buddy copy dynamic, and more.  

To begin with, I wasn't even sure I was going to even watch this because it came off as a discount John Wick (same reason I haven't seen Atomic Blonde), but now I would easily recommend to any John Wick fans with the suspicion that they might actually end up liking it more than any given iteration in the JW series. I'm actually kind of saddened now by how the trailers and promos didn't showcase enough of the best parts of the film to give this movie a better viewership than I've seen it getting.",me3za3

I've never seen another movie like this. I never got around to watching Hardcore Henry? Is it anything like this? I loved the fighting style. I've always admired the John Wick movies, but there aren't my thing. This is what I want in an action movie.

Odenkirk is a freak. Is there anything he can't do? It's been an honor to follow his career from the start.

Ilya still has his video game FPS style even in third person, the explosive traps and the triple shot are some cool moves.

It started out as a movie about a midlife crisis, became a John Wick movie, and ended like a black comedy. It's very well made and seems to have accomplished exactly what it wanted to, but I can't help but feel like there's something inherently contradictory about it. 

The point of a John Wick movie is to vicariously experience spectacular violence, suspending whatever disbelief nessisary to get there. Nobody acts like a John Wick movie, but just when you settle in to gawk at the violence it sticks its thumb in your eye with a self aware joke. You can't properly experience an action movie that is laughing at itself, and by extension the viewer. By the end of the film I started skipping through the beautifully choreographed action scenes because I couldn't bring myself to take them seriously. I was waiting for the next joke. I almost feel like I watched a parody of modern action movies, one that critiques the viewer for failing to see obvious silliness behind the production values.

It sets itself up to be a very gritty, realistic movie about a guy going over the edge, but then after the halfway point, Oderkirk is just a plot-armour invincible super special ops soldier assassin guy and even his soldier buddy and father are just as capable of his skills, it seems.

The plot just got so, so ridiculous, Yulian's antics didn't help, his character was so painstakingly ""bad guy you should feel nothing for"" that it was laughable.

At the part where the stunt man is tossed out of the window, the stunt goes wrong, clearly he was suppose to go throw cleanly and land rolling on the VERY THIN mat that you can see below (they left it in, and on the first viewing you don't even consider its there because of how thin it is, all the other stuff around and how the fall and non-cut glass shattering distracts you).  But it goes wrong and the end of his foot catches the bottom of the pull away window on his way out and he always falls directly onto his head.  

It makes it looked more brutal and gives it a sense of realistic chaos, which honestly makes the fall better, but also he could have died.  I think at the very end he barely manages to turn and land shoulder first, or at least have some of his shoulder share the impact, but it is a very close thing, and he was arguably an inch or two away from permanent injury or death.

I took that to imply he wasn't just a typical gulf war vet and was probably in a special operations outfit himself, where fleeting rumors about a unit of people like Hutch might make rounds.",me3za3

it was a quick and effective way to show that the character is more then he appears. someone “who knows” is quickly acknowledging that the symbol represents something “bad”

This on the other hand it becamse apparent early on Hutch missed doing his old job. He tried very hard to avoid getting back into it at the start of the movie but when those drunk Russians randomly got on the bus he reveled in it and then when he was secretely thrilled when they were connected. He's a state sanctioned sociopath. But I found that to be very interesting take on the genre.",me3za3

gvvbw0m,"John Wick always had a tragic tone to him: he worked for criminals, wanted out, had to really work for it and owed a debt to a bigger criminal for it. Once he was out, he had a short time to live a normal life then his wife died. Days later, he's back to his old life on a revenge crusade, his old buddy shows up to help him, and gets killed.


Nobody has all those elements flipped to be comedic. He worked for the government, wanted out, and if he had to do anything difficult to get out he didn't mention it, instead the biggest issue was that his bosses thought he couldn't hold a normal life, which they were right about. He gets married and his wife is in good health, as are both his children. He gets back to his old life because he was bored, the Russians never really provoked him. His dad and brother show up to help him and both lived, they had fun.",me3za3

Like what was the point of the black russian guy? They give him a name, an intimidation scene, they set him up as a right hand man, and then he dies in a car crash without ever doing anything. 

They set up the gun in the freezer just so he can mindlessly shoot some no name in an already gun-ridden bloated shootout. 

They set the neighbor as a total dick with a nice car and you know at some point the car is gonna be an action sequence. But there's never a comeuppance scene where the neighbor flips shit about how fucked his car is. 

They set up the son as disappointed with how passive Bob OdenKirk was but there's never a scene where the son regains respect for him after some intense thing he does. 

They set up the daughter wanting a cat and wanting back her kitty bracelet but we never see him give her either of these things. 

Just never any scenes where arcs come to fruition or things payoff in a meaningful way. At least John Wick took some time to wallow in John Wick's misery and grow attached to the dog. Hutch's entire cause is his family and they're all one dimensional.",me3za3

I think the movie works better with the flash forward. Knowing that a character has dark past and watching it slowly reveal itself is an effective way to build tension.

Knowing that he survives changes scenes from 'Will he get out of this alive? (which is never that effective due to main character plot armour)' to 'how will he get out of this alive?'",me3za3

I'll have to wait for VOD to even see if the gun prop is a USP (it looked right to me but it's a brief cut) which was offered in 9x19 even before it was offered in .45ACP.

It was it's absolutely awesome pacing, subversing of expected stereotypes and the total lack of sense to the whole movie (I completely lost it when he found the goddamn kitty bracelet under his sofa, which started this whole mess). It was unexpected, people will expect that now in the sequel, which will take the whole wind out of the sails and what made the movie good. More action will be boring. There really is nothing new they could do. John Wick got away with cranking the fantasy up to 11, which will not work in this one. It's more down to earth (while still being over the top ofc) and established itself as a cruder movie. John Wick already had dream- and fantasylike settings.

I will have to re-watch to confirm (or perhaps someone else here can confirm), but if that is indeed the tattoo then I think it's the perfect representation of the character and a genius easter egg.

I've never laughed so god damned hard in a theater in my life.

""My name is Terry and I'm from Hollywood!  Ronnie, you are not like other men, you've got something.  Something special!  AND I WANT IT BADLY! I want to be the man, *behind* the man!

I realize, I'm coming all over you here...  But it's been building up inside of me for *weeks* and I can't control myself!  Let me show you what you've got inside of you, what could *be* inside of you!  If you could just give me the *tiniest* hole, of opportunity, we could go back to your place.  Right now, and I'll pack your shit!""

I almost peed my fucking pants right there in the theater.  I'm pretty sure I stopped breathing twice laughing so hard.  You have to remember, the only description the screening person out wandering the Block at Orange mall gave us was ""Run Ronnie Run, a comedy about a quirky reality TV star as he tries to make it in the movie business"".  No actor list nothing.  They just wander up to people shopping with a clipboard and ask ""do you want to go to a free movie?  how old are you?""

For me, half the fun came from the twist on that premise. Hutch wasn't forced to turn on the wet works, he really really wanted this to be the case but his mundane life offered so few opportunities, even with a home invasion it turned out the robbers' gun wasn't loaded. He's pushed to the edge and the first situation came his way, he escalated into a full on brawl, even stopping the bus driver from calling 911 to make sure he's not interrupted. Turned out, he hit the jackpot, and brought down on himself an entire russian mob on whom he can work through his bloodlust.

h4nazeg,"We don't need to see his daughter receiving the car, we don't need to see the neighbour finding out about his car - we can already infer these results and enjoy the setup of the joke without somebody explaining the punchline. 
Likewise we don't need to see how his son responds, but we do see he has some sort of a reaction - and can ponder whether he's amazed, terrified, angry (likely a mixture of all). 
The bracelet resolution was amusing - it was the catalyst for this film, and was just dropped under the sofa after all.  

The final showdown was very much over the top and likely not to everyone's taste, but I enjoyed it for how happy and joyous it was. Normally we'd expect some heroic sacrifice or tragic death but instead they were all the happiest they could be. It made for a very uplifting ending with a surprisingly supportive family dynamic.  I found that very surprising and refreshing.


As for the black Russian supposedly he's an amalgamation of black Russians that the director knows, and in part due to an influx of black Russians after the Moscow Olympics - but that's from [#18 in this unreliable source](https://filmschoolrejects.com/nobody-commentary/) so take that as you will.

That bit in the hallways where they struggle and clash and grabble and roll from one end to the other? Dang!

With just meta-knowledge you have mostly good guesses, but there is still uncertainty and the possibility that the movie might play with those expectations and turn them on their head. You already suspect the character has a dark past and you suspect that he's gonna be fine - so why kill that engagement by instantly revealing that your assumptions are correct? Knowing that he survives doesn't *change* the question to ""how?"". The ""how?"" is present in any case, all you did was definitively rob yourself of the ""if"".

Flash forwards, really, are nothing but a crutch and a sure sign that the writer has no clue what they are doing. Show some crazy scene, then cut to ""TWO WEEKS EARLIER""... give me a break. The only reason you would do that is because your writing is so boring that you have to prove that ""juicy"" stuff is coming so that your viewers don't walk away in the first 10 minutes.

i loved this movie, it was much more then just a beat em up action movie. it was slapstick almost but done without a tongue in a cheek. 

my take away from the husband/wife dynamic was that the wife never asked questions and didn’t really dig into his backstory. i don’t believe she knew of his past, but their relationship was obviously at a point where it was near empty. the movie had silly tropes but done really realistically. that’s how i would imagine a couple acting if one of them was a psycho who was just lying all the time.

gvq9xs7,">I was kind of hoping the movie was making fun of people like his shitty macho neighbor for being bloodthirsty, but the entire movie is kind of just that attitude. 

It was making fun of Macho guys who talk shit without anything backing it up. It was also making fun of guys who dispense violence without justification.

It tried to subvert this with scenes like when the bosses son tries to punch him and he hits him in the solar plexus, but gently ushers him down and encourages him to breathe. Also with his monologue about the man he lets go.

It wants to frame him as a just man who uses violence only as a tool, when necessary. He gives the Russians a chance to back down, they don't take it. He has his fingers crossed, he hopes they do, but he's fully equipped to deal with them if they don't.

>The movie kind of took me out of it when he gets back on the bus. The fight was over essentially, the woman could have at that point just got up and walked off, but I'm supposed to root for him getting back on and brutalizing these dudes?

I think they tried to make it clear that the woman wasn't gonna get off that bus in one piece. They had the line ""a woman shouldn't be alone on a bus at night"" to infer their intentions were bad, coupled with the boss's own assessment of his brother as a sociopath to cement that it wouldn't have ended well for her. I agree that they could've taken a more heavy handed approach to make it absolutely clear that those guys were going to rape her, but I don't think they had to.

guoqg05,"That would've been a cool idea for a movie. The reason I don't get that vibe is that they never acknowledge it in the film. If this was about how psychotic the man was, his wife should've left him and took the kids after he admitted he was unfit to live a healthy life with his family. They shouldn't have a whole scene where his wife heals his wounds and he schpiels about how distant they've grown while she looks on lovingly, like their relationship can be mended. They should address the fact that he talks about his family like property and does not mind literally burning down their entire house without notice to live out his power fantasy. You can't be too fucked up to have a family, but still come out of the movie with your family.

Eh, to a point.

The suppressor scene in JW3 is peak Hollywood cartoon gun nonsense.

All the bad guys have terrible marksmanship. Even stormtroopers aim well enough to need their shots deflected by light sabers every once in a while.

Wick gets credit for gun realism, but the only gun realism is from Wick himself. And then there's the plot armor that Iosef wears that turns Wick from a crack shot who can down 15 dudes with face shots in 2 minutes, but can't even wing Iosef when he's running away? I get it, it's *so the movie can happen*, but it seemed cliche.

Don't get me wrong, I very much appreciate the attention to detail they put into Wick, but it's still a comic book level of realism.

Lastly,

>I dont agree with comparing it with john wick.

The [same screenwriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Kolstad#Films) wrote the Wick movies and Nobody, and if you take a look at his filmography, literally every script he's penned is about a lone wolf, who happens to be a former operator of the highest order, who is wronged by organized crime and goes on a revenge spree.

For Hutch, that permission is the person has to ""deserve"" it, then he will allow himself to flip from civilian to operator mode. Because he knows the gun was not loaded, then these aren't hardened criminals prepared to kill, so he couldn't cut loose like he wanted.


He did a reverse home invasion because his daughter lost the kitty bracelet, and in his mind that justified breaking and entering, but once there he ran out of excuse to go one step further because the couple had a sick baby, so they were more sympathetic in his eyes.

i mean, it gets more comic booky as the movies continues to get made, but would still call it some of the best representation we have so far...

> The [same screenwriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Kolstad#Films) wrote the Wick movies and Nobody, and if you take a look at his filmography, literally every script he's penned is about a lone wolf, who happens to be a former operator of the highest order, who is wronged by organized crime and goes on a revenge spree.

Hutch has no moral high ground as he attacked the mobster's brother unprovoked and left him for dead, especially when the fight was over and Hutch restarted it of his own free will just to make it more violent.

*Oh but Hutch isn't a good guy, he's a psycho, he can't live the stable family life, that was the point*

So then why does he still have custody of his children? Why is there no remorse for wasting ~20 years of his wife's life trying to live a lie? Why are we meant to sympathize with this immoral psycho as he tries to take down a Russian empire he stumbled into discovering?

In this way he's got a lot in common with John McClane, or Jackie Chan. I got some hints of Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, 7 Psychopaths) influence in Nobody.

Wick takes itself way more seriously and has an overall darker tone. It's more surgical in its execution. It's more towards the Bruce Lee end of the action spectrum. The Raid and Ong-Bak come to mind.

We think those guys were trouble, because Hutch thought so, and that's the perspective we're given in the movie. We however also have to look at it objectively and ask if with the objective information we're given Hutch objectively had enough justification to commit murder. The facts are: a: guys drunkenly crash a car. b: they ask if they're allowed to enter the bus (emphasis on ask: they didn't threaten the bus driver to open the door). c: they surround the girl and ask her uncomfortable questions about why she's on the bus by herself. I'd say absolutely not and that it was an unwarranted escalation of a situation which didn't have to end this way at all. Hutch would have the right to tell the guys to piss off, and to protect the girl if needed by escorting her of the bus, but everything else would be pure bloodlust and done for his own personal satisfaction, not out of a sense of justice or concern for others. With his fighting skills (not to mention that he also carried a gun with him), we know he would have been able to safely escort the girl if he wanted to, but we know he just chose to not do so (""with great power comes great responsibility"", that kind of stuff). This is what makes it hard for me to root for him, since he's basically doing everything in the movie for purely selfish reasons: he murders because he just likes murdering.

My opinion is that because of his previous job and the story about the guy he let go, he can tell pretty easily and quickly what type of people people are.

gys5iw8,"I keep asking because it's an important reason why he should've lost his family. Sympathetic protagonists are a *really* big deal in storytelling. Losing his family would be the natural conclusion of not being mentally stable enough to have a family, and it would fix the problem of him not being sympathetic.

And no, he doesn't have to be a ""good guy"". He can be exactly the same character. There are plenty of impulsive, psychopathic characters that remain sympathetic because the universe reacts to their psychopathy with consequences. This movie was just bad at it.",me3za3
gys5stj,"Consequences aren't the only way to egender sympathy. We get sympathy for Hutch through the opening of the story - his marriage troubles, work woes, trouble with his son, failure to act in crisis, general ennui, and, on the plus side, sweet relationship with his daughter, are all what fostet a connection with the character. He's a normal, every day, shmo who has a power fantasy - the difference between him and a large swath of America is that his fantasy comes true.",me3za3
gys6fvw,"And that power fantasy coming true comes at the expense of literally everyone else he interacts with, which flushes that sympathy down the toilet real quick.

Let me ask you - if this happened in real life, if that wife was your sister, if those kids were your niece and nephew, would you not want them to get away from this clearly psychotic man?",me3za3
gys6pbg,"Obviously, but like I said, this isn't Breaking Bad - it's not a morality play. I don't watch it to the real consequences of insane violence. I watch it to see three men get shot in the head and for Christopher Loyd to say he brought all the shotguns because of all the Russians.",me3za3
gys6ybj,"Right, so are you're saying he *was* hard to root for and I shouldn't care? Please pick one and stop moving the goalposts around",me3za3
gys772c,"This is maybe the third time I've said I'm not discussing at all how easy or hard he is to root for. I'm saying that tacking on some consequences to the end doesn't make him more sympathetic in retrospect, and it's not like that would help you root for the things he does before that moment. It's immaterial to the point I'm making, which is that this isn't a morality play, and tacking on a maudline little epilogue isn't a necessity, and it's asking the movie to be something it isn't trying to be.",me3za3
gys884a,"Well first of all, how a story ends is also very important to judging its quality. If a movie is great 90% of the way but the end leaves a sour taste in your mouth by reversing/ignoring the consequences for characters' actions, the movie sucks. You can ruin Infinity War in the last 30 seconds by saying ""whoops, it was all a dream! Tony Stark was just paranoid and Thanos isn't real"". So even if my point was ""the ending sucked"" that'd be a valid complaint.

But back to this film - Hutch was hard to root for during 90% of the film, but part of what kept me watching was the assumption that eventually the universe would reward/punish him accordingly, because that's how good stories work. He seems relatable, a good father, even if a little violent. But then he becomes more reckless and deranged as the movie goes on. Naturally, you'd think eventually this would catch up with him. And then it just never happened.

I'm not asking for a last-second epilogue to tie everything nicely, I'm asking for a properly-written story that makes Hutch a sympathetic morally gray protagonist, and this story wasn't that.

Also, just to plant this flag in the ground right now, you **are** saying Hutch was not sympathetic. You didn't say it directly, but you've been implying it for like 6 comments now so I'm just gonna say it for you since you don't want to admit it yourself.",me3za3
gyt3mzt,I'm saying Hutch was obviously a bad guy who did bad things. I'm not saying he was entkrely unsympathetic.,me3za3
gyux4ed,"""Good guy"" and ""bad guy"" say nothing about how good the story was. ""Sympathetic protagonist"" and ""unsympathetic protagonist"" does.",me3za3
gyuxfob,"Thus why I'm saying he wasntebtirely unsympathetic, and why I think the argument that your sympathy for a bad guy is contingent on the assumption the writers will punish him for his bad actions at the end of the movie isn't compelling.",me3za3
gyuy2c1,I think at this point you should just admit this is a power fantasy for you and the idea that Hutch should lose his family is making you uncomfortable because you don't want to admit there should be consequences for being a psychopath,me3za3
gyuyj9e,"Nope, not what I'm saying. I'm saying that in real life, sometimes bad actions don't lead to bad consequences, and I'm able to deal with watching a movie that isn't a morality play. This is a bizzare discussion. I wonder if you spend this much time telling people what they think in real life. I mean, not curious enough to continue this, but a little curious.",me3za3
gyuzetg,"Well I enjoy discussing with people about media I consume, and I'm pretty sure that's what this website is for.

I see you keep falling back on ""this isn't a morality play"" and ""Hutch isn't a good guy"" because you're making zero effort to understand the point I'm making, so maybe I should've decided this was a lost cause like 6 comments ago. But eh. I like discussing movies.",me3za3
h2r802o,"I know its late but I enjoyed reading this thread and it got me curious as to your thoughts on a few things.

You said that you had fun watching the film but it seems the character not getting consequences is what took away from your enjoyment. Why does someone experiencing consequences for their actions make a good story?

Why do you think protagonists need to be sympathetic?

Not all protagonists are sympathetic. For example, Lolita a universally praised novel has an unsympathetic protagonist. Humbert Humbert suffers consequences for murdering a person but that doesn't make him sympathetic. People still enjoy the novel.

Also why does a character need to be either sympathetic or unsympathetic? Why can't they be both?

When I watched the movie I was completely sympathetic with him right up until he went to the initial robbers' home. From then on I disagreed with every step he took but I was curious and wanted to see what he would do next.

In that way I was rooting for him because when it comes down to it, it's a movie.",me3za3
h2td0vj,"I'm so tired of trying to explain this lmao

My point is not that the main character has to be ""good"". *Lolita* is about a literal pedophile. The reason the novel works is the universe treats that pedophile like a pedophile. The *moment* Charlotte is aware of his attraction, she does everything she can to get the child to safety. We're not meant to hope Humbert gets what he wants - in fact the opposite is true. You spend the first third of the novel *almost* feeling bad for him, but when he begins lying and manipulating to get his way, it's pure disgust towards him and you're rooting for *anyone* who can step in and make things right. The novel doesn't try to portray Humbert as a clever, enviable badass, but as a sick, sad, sadistic man who abuses his power. You aren't supposed to want Humbert to win, and the story moves accordingly. This is how you tell a story about unsavory subject matter and an unsympathetic protagonist without leaving a sour taste in a reader's mouth.

In *Nobody*, the film invests in the idea that we're supposed to care what happens to Hutch. They want us to believe he's sympathetic and that we want him to survive. The thing is, unlike the *Lolita* universe, the *Nobody* universe does not even try to punish Hutch for being excessively violent and reckless. His family doesn't mind being traumatized. His friends/accomplices treat near-death situations like fun little adventures. The rules that apply to everyone else in this universe do not apply to Hutch.

I've said this a few times, but the easiest solution would be to have Hutch lose his family. If the wife had any agency or self-respect, she'd draw the line at the house being burned down. The reason she doesn't is because this movie is a power fantasy and that would break the immersion for the movie's target audience.",me3za3
h2tx2h9,"I'm going to try summarize what your argument is, please correct me if I'm wrong.

The film Nobody wants the audience to sympathize with/root for the main character but fails to do so because he doesn't experience any consequences for his actions.",me3za3
h2u1q7y,"That's really close to it, but I can smell a counterargument centered around a film with unsympathetic protagonist who doesn't experience consequences coming on, so I want to include this caveat:

If the film did not present Hutch's dysfunction and bloodthirst as badass, there wouldn't be as big of a problem, even if he ""wins"" in the end.",me3za3
h2uaak5,"Again correct me if im wrong.

Im getting that for you the movie would be better and more enjoyable if it was more grounded in realism.

I guess enjoyment of the movie depends on one's personal expectations of the film.

I felt the goal was to have an aging bob odenkirk starring in an action movie with over the top violence and felt like it was accomplished.",me3za3
h2udxsa,"Please show me where I said or implied anything about realism

And yeah like I said, it's a dumb action movie and I enjoyed it",me3za3
h2upmkq,Having consequences to actions is a pretty realistic thing wouldn't you say?,me3za3
h2uqoi7,"I mean yeah, but the point isn't to make it realistic, and the complaint has nothing to do with it being unrealistic, so I'm not sure why you mentioned it",me3za3
h2uyagp,What's your frame of reference for why he should lose his family if not realism? Is it just rooted in your opinion of what you think would make the movie better?,me3za3
h2uz4f4,"I think you're using ""frame of reference"" wrong, but if I understand you correctly you're asking what the reason is for wanting him to lose his family if not because I think it would be more ""realistic"".

It has nothing to do with realism, really, it's exactly what I said it had to do with - consequences for unsympathetic/asshole characters doing asshole things. As an example, *Infinity War* was about mythical supernatural creatures fighting over magical rocks that control the universe. Obviously not realistic. But the violence in that film is internally consistent. We're meant to sympathize with Thanos to an extent, because he honestly thinks he's doing the right thing. But the key is, literally everyone else in that universe calls him crazy and says his plan is incredibly immoral. When he does violent, reckless things that hurt innocent people, the heroes of the story react accordingly. I think Thanos is a great example because he's still, in ways, a badass - his fight scenes are compelling and we see him struggle and sacrifice to get what he wants. But like I've said a million times (and will say again), *the universe punishes Thanos for his immoral plans*. Hutch's universe rewards him, which tells me the writers believe what he's doing is okay and that we're expected to think it's also okay. That has nothing to do with realism and everything to do with good storytelling.",me3za3
h2v4mnx,"why does him needing consequences make good storytelling? I don't get that part. Like are you using a universal rubric for storytelling that I should be aware of? Cause from what I gather you think its bad storytelling because you've decided that its bad storytelling.

I would argue that Nobody is internally consistent. His wife knew who he was before their marriage, they drifted apart when he led his civilian life, them rekindling their relationship after events of the film is entirely consistent. His father and friend share his enjoyment of violence and missed the action, their reactions are consistent. Him being let off by the police because he's notorious and has a deep history in clandestine government operations is consistent.",me3za3
h2v8rjv,">why does him needing consequences make good storytelling?

That's a much deeper question than I believe the writers were expecting us to ask while watching the film, but I can break it down.

Basically, the way the universe treats a character is a reflection of what the writer(s) wants us to understand or believe about the story. Using a non-film example: the tortoise and the hare. The tortoise and the hare, as characters, believe opposite things. The hare believes he is unbeatable, and the tortoise believes he can win a race if he stays consistent and committed to his goal. The universe agrees with the tortoise, and it rewards his mindset. The hare loafs around arrogantly, then finds he can't win the race. The hare is wrong, there are consequences for being wrong, and those consequences are aligned with the message the story is trying to send.

The beliefs/philosophy of the protagonist don't always represent those of the author - Todd Phillips wrote and directed *Joker*, but I doubt he believes murdering people who say mean things about you on TV is okay. But even if the *protagonist* doesn't represent the writer, the *universe* of that movie does. Fleck shoots the host, and people run screaming out of the set. The police find and apprehend Fleck, and then he spends his life in a mental hospital. In Fleck's mind, he's ""won"". To everyone else, Fleck is a fucking maniac who should never see the outside world for the rest of his life.

Now, writers won't always do this on purpose. Using another example, the Avengers destroyed city after city during fight scenes in their movies, but are hailed as heroes when the film concludes. Without intending to, the writers co-signed the Avengers' reckless violence. At the end of *Age of Ultron*, we're not led to believe the Avengers feel shitty about innocent people they've hurt, nor does the universe try to make them feel guilty. That whole situation becomes the core struggle a few movies later (Civil War, I think).

Back to *Nobody*...

Hutch is an asshole to his kids. He gets involved in life-threatening violence for no reason other than his own bloodlust. This has horrible consequences for his family and friends. If this was just Hutch, I wouldn't have a problem. But *Nobody's* universe also thinks his asshole behavior is okay because he looks so badass doing it. This is what I mean by internal consistency - either the writers think what Hutch is doing is okay, which is big bad, or they think it's wrong and refuse to write the universe accordingly, which is also bad for the message it sends.

>His wife knew who he was before their marriage, they drifted apart when he led his civilian life, them rekindling their relationship after events of the film is entirely consistent.

Which makes her an asshole, and their children the victims.

>His father and friend share his enjoyment of violence and missed the action, their reactions are consistent.

Which makes them assholes.

>Him being let off by the police because he's notorious and has a deep history in clandestine government operations is consistent.

I didn't say anything about the police and I get why they did what they did (or rather didn't do what they didn't do). Hutch's actions were a net win for them, especially because they're completely absolved of responsibility since he didn't do it as a cop.",me3za3
h2wng7v,Youre saying that the quality of storytelling is dependent on the message the audience perceives whether the writer is intentional with it or not.,me3za3
