h8qqdgw,For a Ryan Reynolds produced movie a lot of characters sure were open about how hot a character looking exactly like Ryan Reynolds is.,p3ebrt
h8stujg,"The scene where she tells him to turn around and he's just like ""okay!"" And does a little spin with a stupid smile on his face had me rolling.

This was such a happy movie! Cheesy as hell and everything I expected it to be. I'm a sucker for Ryan Reynolds.",p3ebrt
h8tsvbu,"Hey Keys, maybe be a bro and program a Millie into the game so Guy isn’t hanging around “unable to find love” forever",p3ebrt
h8r09jp,"Evans got the biggest reaction, but when Tatum first appeared at the beginning of the movie, the people beside me were debating if it was him or not. They lost it when it became pretty clear it was him. Still doesn’t beat his cameo in This Is The End though.",p3ebrt
h8qv198,"I loved DUDE's unfinished nature. The T-shirt icon on his pectorals, his 'catchphrase', and the fact that Antwan convinced the Art nerds to just throw on a gold chain before anything else. Hilarious.",p3ebrt
h8tvh3l,"Tired: “They referenced Marvel, Star Wars, Valve games, Mega Man, and Fortnite!”

Wired: “They referenced the [greatest movie scene](https://youtu.be/mikj8eDKxMQ) of all time.”",p3ebrt
h8qnhqy,Catchphrase!,p3ebrt
h8ueitb,"I loved the background stuff, there was one scene were a background player kept jumping into a wall and lagging around the place which I thought was so spot on. I even didn't mind the cameos from streamers/YouTubers either, I thought it was a real nice touch to include them.",p3ebrt
h8qj0rj,Was the guy Mills gets the info from then kills Hugh Jackman??,p3ebrt
h9799a3,"Ted Lasso and Free Guy being two successes during the pandemic really makes you think. 

Maybe the American people just want something wholesome and fun with the rough 18 months we’ve been through. 

I’m all for it",p3ebrt
h8s1snw,You can see the exact moment Disney and Fox merged in this movie,p3ebrt
h8uhrq8,The Chris Evans cameo made me laugh,p3ebrt
h8rwbmu,Taika Waititi being in both The Suicide Squad (although more of a cameo) and Free Guy in consecutive weeks and both being great films.,p3ebrt
h8vo6fx,The Alex Trebek Cameo actually made me a bit sad I was not expecting that,p3ebrt
h8rbuv1,OFFICER JOHNNY!!!!,p3ebrt
h8qjaxn,I liked that Guy wasn’t the only NPC who was evolving. The barista and the bombshell companion character both had their own growth.,p3ebrt
h8qrrca,Well that was about as god damn wholesome as it gets.,p3ebrt
h8r960v,"As an immigrant in New Zealand, this movie definitely hit the ""kiwi cinema goers go wild for Taika Waititi showing up in a film"" that I've come to expect.

I really enjoyed it. It's a fun movie, with lots of homages to other movies, and a genuinely interesting story. Is it the best movie in the world? No. Does it need to be? No. I liked it more than I expected to, to be honest.

One of my favourite things about it was the friendship between Guy and Buddy. They could easily have had Buddy just stay as an irrelevant NPC that Guy outgrows when he realises he's an AI - but those guys genuinely really care for each other and Buddy is always there for him in ways I didn't see coming. I loved that at the end, the friendship between Guy and Buddy was given as much weight as (if not more than) >!the romance between Millie and Keys.!<",p3ebrt
h8usdwc,"There were quite a lot of kids in my screening, all of which reacted with laughs and such when the likes of jacksepticeye, DanTDM and Pokimane showed up. I thought it was cute.

Overall, it was a fun movie. Better than I was expecting it to be, honestly.",p3ebrt
h8qkb16,The true hero of this movie is RTX reflections.,p3ebrt
h8qom7f,"Every time I saw what ""Free City"" looks like in real life it reminds me of those shitty mobile game ads that look/are nothing like the actual game.",p3ebrt
h8uv84i,This is pretty much the best Saints Row movie or Grand Theft Auto movie ever made.,p3ebrt
h8ugeg6,“What the shit?!”,p3ebrt
h90bwqs,"Might be bold to say, but I think this is the best movie of the summer. A completely original film beating out a Marvel, DC, and F&F movie is no easy feat.",p3ebrt
h8ryqw6,Now we now those  shades in the matrix weren't just silly cosmetics,p3ebrt
h8qvge9,"I love Taika Waititi, but man I feel like that role was made for Aziz Ansari.",p3ebrt
h8sbe3l,I really enjoyed it and thought it did a great job at portraying a virtual game world vs reality without making up some ultra futuristic virtual reality system that always distracted me in other movies with similar basic concepts.,p3ebrt
h8y0out,Don't touch my sock!,p3ebrt
h98ry2l,Liked the movie a lot. But can we recognize that the first 15 minutes is almost exactly The Lego Movie? Like nearly shot for shot.,p3ebrt
h8qj10c,Fun movie with more heart than I was expecting. Alex Trebek and Chris Evans cameo will get lot of attention but man Channing Tatum killed it as well.,p3ebrt
h8qhq11,"My boy, Steve ""The Hair"" Harrington, finally got the girl.",p3ebrt

h8qr5z9,"Imma be honset, i was a little bit disappointed Millie didn't sing the Mariah Carey song to make Guy remember but they made up for it by using it in the climax. 

Anywho, I thought it was a great movie. Its like the Truman Show of video games, is the best comparison i can think of. The cameos and references were great. 

Of the movies I've seen since theaters have been back: this, Jungle Cruise and suicide squad have been a delight",p3ebrt
h8qidag,"The Channing Tatum scene cutting between him and the person behind his character was so goofy.

EDIT: Also was that Alex Trebek? RIP.",p3ebrt
h8susql,"TFW I noticed the icon for ""subtle product placement"" but couldn't figure out what the product was",p3ebrt
ha12llh,"Good movie but as an IT guy and a gamer some of the stuff at the end regarding computers was bugging me. I know, just let it go, but I just kept thinking how that is not how it worked.

* >!If reseting the servers would make him lose his AI programming then the players would probably lose all their stuff, thus destroying the game.!<
* >!They don't need to go to the island in the game to prove they used their source code, just look through the code. Also, when the villain bought their game company I am sure this would have covered his ability to use their code.!<
* >!Later, when the CEO (sorry no idea about the name) is trying to stop them why did he try to destroy the servers? He literally just rebooted all servers a few minutes ago. Just do the same thing but shut them down.!<
* >!When the CEO starts destroying servers the first whiff of smoke in a modern looking datacenter like that would have set off the fire suppression system killing him if he didn't immediately evacuate. Even if that didn't kill him he probably would have electrocuted himself. That many servers is no joke on the voltage. Also, very doubtful they would have an on-prem data center.!<
* >!Very doubtful a game company would launch a sequel and then just just down the original server. they would run both in parallel until the original lost enough subscribers. I think they still run EverQuest servers.!<
* >!Prior to the server room destruction, the protagonists just could have got the AI data from backups. Any company worth its salt would also have a secondary copy of backups offsite. So there was little danger of losing the AI. At any point, the Stranger Things dude could have just copied the backup files and ended the movie much sooner.!<
* >!Last, which is covered in the movie but bears repeating, fan bases of games have abandoned them and caused them to fail for far less. Yea they said it was a flop because of bugs but all the other crap, especially lack of backwards compatabilioty after promsiing it would have caused it to flop most likely.!<",p3ebrt
h8xa25s,I expected Jeff Bridges when they began to upload Dude to Free City.,p3ebrt
h8qlkq3,Downtown and Make Your Own Kind of Music within the first half hour? Was someone a LOST fan or just a coincidence?,p3ebrt
h8vklvy,Our theater absolutely lost it when Guy used Captain America's Shield and the Lightsaber. Feels amazing being back in a theater with that kind of energy,p3ebrt
h8qx2b7,"Fun movie, one thing. 
The scene where Keys and Millie are looking at each other at the end lasted so long and cut back and forth so many times it could have been a sketch from “I think you should leave”",p3ebrt
h8qqbzk,"Man I needed a feel good movie like that. I laughed, I cried but most importantly man I had fun.",p3ebrt
h8qqbcx,"""Don't you see it? I'm a love letter to you""

That part actually made me emotional and I was NOT expecting it. It was incredibly well made, everything connected. The characters actually feel genuine.",p3ebrt
h8qhn9k,"The Chris Evans cameo had my theater howling.

Question though: I remember that this movie was in the can before Disney bought Fox, did they add that stuff in reshoots?",p3ebrt
h8w13ns,"I know folks mostly like the other music, but it was the musical theme from Christophe Beck that caught me.   It was immediately familiar like something I'd known for a long time. But even though I recognized it, but couldn't place it right away.  It is labeled 'ice cream' on the score.  It also plays as his memory comes back I think.

I Just spent hours trying to figure it out.  I didn't know anything about Beck before this, but I know composers like to reuse some of their best and sometimes underappreciated work.  After reading through his previous work, I finally got it.  It was from the Disney short 'Paperman', one of my favorite shorts.  I've seen it a ton of times.  The familiar part is towards the end.

h904jr3,I know this will be a weird comparison for many but am I the only person who got some Truman Show vibes from parts of this movie?,p3ebrt
h8rines,"20 minutes in I was thinking ""This is fine. Its basically just the trailer"" but the further into the movie I got, the more I started to enjoy it.

It has a surprisingly emotional plot and a really feel good attitude plus a lot of the jokes are genuinely funny. I like Ryan Reynolds at this level where he's doing the shtick he's known for but not going too over the top with it and I surprisingly felt invested in the real world stuff

Up there with Barb and Star as my biggest surprise of this year",p3ebrt
h8ue7gd,I was so much waiting for a They Live wrestling match about putting the glasses on. Too bad that didn't happen.,p3ebrt
h8qsjax,"Watched it with my gf, afterwards she comented, “Steve Harrington can say that his love letter was so powerful that it came to life as goofy Ryan Reynolds, what girl wouldn’t ride his dick?”

In all seriousness a very heartfelt movie that actually is thoughtful about the themes presented. If you can get past whatever the fuck Taika Waititi was trying to do as Anton and you’ve got a fun well made blockbuster that has fun with the video game concepts it presents.",p3ebrt
h8qhs7r,"Man that Alex Trebek cameo hit hard, RIP",p3ebrt
h8r2lab,"I liked it, but man Taika Waititi was truly not good in this. I guess they were going for “horribly out of touch middle aged man” because the “whatchu talking bout, willis” line was pure cringe",p3ebrt
h8qi3ba,The Captain America and Star Wars moments were so hilarious,p3ebrt
h8r13j4,"The fact that the movie had Dwayne Johnson, Tina Fey, Hugh Jackman, and John Krasinski all in just voice cameos. I did think the guy who gave Millie the info sounded like Jackman and even with his history with Reynolds and working with Shawn Levy before, I still was doubting myself. https://www.ign.com/articles/chris-evans-free-guy-cameos",p3ebrt
h8rb8zz,"Fun movie! Better than I thought it would be!

- Ryan Reynolds playing himself again but with a little bit of heart
- Film was deeper than I thought. Never expected it to be indie game developers fighting a gaming studio for stealing their code.
- Jodie Comer is great in the movie! She's about to blow up like crazy with The Last Duel
- CGI in the film was a little unrefined but I can chalk it up to the graphics in the Free City game
- I felt like some scenes were changed in post-production and reshoots. Some scenes that appeared in the trailer also don't make the final cut.
- Some of the cameos were great! Seeing Channing Tatum after quite some time is great!
- The movie took full advantage of the Disney-Fox merger with the Avengers and Star Wars references!
- Never thought Joe Keery's character would get the girl. I kept waiting for one of them get hit by a vehicle when they reunited in the middle of the road. 
- Guy getting his friend back was a nice way to end the film! Their friendship was wholesome throughout the movie! 

Really had fun watching the movie! Movie glitched out for 20mins in my cinema during the 2nd act but I wouldn't mind watching it again!",p3ebrt
h8r1i3s,"This was delightful. It isn't the highest of art, but it was still a damn enjoyable experience.",p3ebrt
h8qij86,"Fun movie, Jodie Comer was the star and her leather pants MVP",p3ebrt
h8vbyc8,Glad I went back to the theaters to see this just for the Chris Evans reaction. Life is good,p3ebrt
h8r3k6z,DUDE was fucking hilarious. Every time he was on screen just in the midst of a crowd I was cracking up.,p3ebrt
h8xnzjp,"I feel like the IRL story could’ve been tighter but all in all this was a lot of fun. Ryan Reynolds flexes his natural charm and the movie didn’t make the Ready Player One mistake of just throwing a bunch of stuff in from other properties. That way, when what happens in the third act happens, it’s a genuine surprise.",p3ebrt
h8qikl3,"The movie was very entertaining, but I don't really get the motivation of Taika Waititi's character (Antwan), he just seemed like he was written in just to give the film a more active villain (instead of the threat of the game shutting down naturally). Also, Keys' friend was opposing him and bootlicking Antwan yet at the end they were still buddies?",p3ebrt
h8wqfjz,The Channing Tatum revival has begun!,p3ebrt
h90647j,"I truly hated Antwon while watching this film. The directors and actor did very well to make him as greedy, unlikable, and petty as possible. 

Worst part is, I feel like I could've turned out as money-hungry and petty as him if it weren't for people in my life bringing me down to reality.",p3ebrt
h8tpfsa,"Free Guy is the type of movie you know you’re not meant to take too seriously and just go along with the ride. That being said, how much you’ll like it depends on your tolerance for Ryan Reynolds. If you never found him funny, don’t bother as he’s loud, brash, slightly obnoxious, and very chatty in this. He has some good moments though, but a lot of jokes are very hit and miss, but yeah this is a silly movie and you shouldn’t think too hard about logic stuff.

The concept is pretty good, although not the most original thing in the world. The idea of a protagonist figuring out his whole life is a video game is cool and the film takes some advantage of being creative and wacky with the world and concepts surrounding it. There’s product placement, references to movies, game stuff, and Twitch streamers in it, so yeah it’s very corporate, but it didn’t bother me much.

Overall, I didn’t dislike this and treated it for what it is. A fun silly blockbuster that doesn’t try to be high art and just there to entertain. The film starts out decent but loses steam around the halfway mark. I wasn’t the biggest fan of Taika Waititi in this, unfortunately. I was able to tolerate Ryan Reynolds, but any time he was the focus it became a bit grating. It doesn’t all work and I’m sure there are plotholes and logic issues, but you know what I got some enjoyment and laughs out of it. 6/10",p3ebrt
ha8lat4,I can’t be the only one who didn’t like this movie,p3ebrt
h8qshun,Taika saying he had ass & ball cancer then gestures to them both going “INOPERABLE!!!” is the hardest I’ve laughed at a movie in awhile.,p3ebrt
h9kxghf,"Don't think I enjoyed it nearly as much as the majority of this subreddit. Didn't think it was bad but also didn't live up to it's potential.

The idea of GTA NPC becoming self-aware is great, but can't help but feel like this movie could have done more with the set-up. I feel like a major part of this is because the *Free City* video game remains poorly defined and never actually feels like a game. Whereas the worlds of comparable films like *The Truman Show* and *The Lego Movie* feel defined, *Free Guy*'s video game setting feels less concrete and more like a mish-mash of references and tropes that are more window-dressing than anything else.

The naive protagonist trying to save a fictional world from destruction continually invites comparisons to *The Lego Movie* but *Free Guy* lacks that movie's wit and heart. It's a light and breezy watch but I doubt I'll ever feel the need to revisit or think about it again.",p3ebrt
h8qhw1k,"Honestly it’s a really cute movie, with a lot of heart.
It’s a fun popcorn flick, that I wish more people could go to the movies and see. I laughed a good amount of times and had fun with it.


One of my minor grips is that there’s a glaring amount of ADR in this. It’s probably from the various (COVID) delays, it kept taking me out of the movie.",p3ebrt
h8ren04,The Chris Evans “WHAT THE SHIT?!?!” was so funny.,p3ebrt
h8z8fzi,I wish Mouser had tried to stop Antoine in the server room. He could have redeemed himself by buying Buddy and Guy their moment rather than the destruction just pausing conveniently. Plus the added irony of the security guards cheering for Buddy as their colleague enables his destruction by removing Mouser from the server room.,p3ebrt
h8qmgzl,Ten times the film the marketing leads you to believe. So much more heart than I was expecting.,p3ebrt
ha14t3f,"I saw this yesterday with a fairly packed theatre. There were several kids in the same row as me, all younger than 10 or 11. Towards the beginning when we first see Reynolds, one of them whispers ""who is that guy again?"" One of the others responded ""I can't remember his name right now.""

But when those YouTubers showed up on screen, these kids lost their fucking minds. They knew all of them, and were practically screaming in glee over it. 

I think they missed most of the references and cameos, but they sure as hell didn't miss that.",p3ebrt
h8vvyo7,"Man, after watching a screening back in Feb 2020 I can finally talk about the movie.",p3ebrt
h8v59lz,"Second Life, Fortnite, Grand Theft Auto, and the Sims rolled into one with references to Halo, Star Wars, and Marvel and some big names from both the acting world and the streaming world as background characters. Went in with low expectations and came out with a big smile on my face!",p3ebrt
h8zpvjy,"The theater I was in was about 75% full , biggest audience at a movie since before covid",p3ebrt
h8qhzg1,"I was really impressed with this movie. Like many others, I wasn’t expecting much when the promo started and I hadn’t planned to see it until I recently saw it getting good reviews. A few jokes and lines of dialogue didn’t quite land, but when they did they REALLY landed. There are a few moments near the end that are some of the most satisfying, funny movie moments I can think of in quite some time. Overall, I had a lot of fun with this and I’d definitely encourage people to check it out. Lots of charm, and for a video game movie it felt very self aware and it was obvious the creators did their research.",p3ebrt
h8ttzas,"It's a bit of a mindfuck having this movie come out now. I don't even remember really why at this point, but I took a picture of the poster one of the last times I went to a theater --- almost two years ago.",p3ebrt
h8qirze,"This movie was way better than I expected. I feel the trailers undersold it. I’m not saying it was Oscar worthy or even the best popcorn flick, but it was definitely fun. Maybe it was my low expectations, but the theater reactions were genuine.",p3ebrt
he2dx7i,"So disappointed and I enjoy most of Reynolds' work. Tech Jargon was awful and forced, the cameos from streamers were entirely unneeded, the acting from some was just phoned in or bad enough I'm sure they are people they found on the corner. A lot of it was just ""look at popular game reference here"" behind that is a very, very weak love story. Something I doubt I see again.",p3ebrt
h8qinsu,"I love they just nonchalantly threw in their one f-word. Not in a fight scene or even when Taika was berating his employees.
Also Taika going from a fan favorite in one movie last week to a heel in a movie the following week. Is there anything that man can’t do?",p3ebrt

20 mins later her main character somehow kisses guy 🤦🏻‍♂️",p3ebrt

h91plwm,"Couple plots holes and inconsistencies, but by no means does it ruin the movie.",p3ebrt
h92vkmm,"Loved all the video game references and I'm going to have to rewatch it a few times to catch them all.  I enjoyed Taika Waititi's villain, but when I heard his voice all I could think of was Korg. It was like someone mixed Korg with Aziz Ansari. I felt like they could have pulled the plug on all the characters in the game pretty easily and quickly, but Antwan hacking all the servers made for a better movie, I guess. I knew it was Hugh Jackman instantly and after hearing him I kept waiting for more cameos. I think the best parts of the movies are the cameos, like Tina Fey playing the one guy's mom who's vacumming while his Channing Tatum character is dealing with Guy. The movie could have ended with that combo of Captain's shield, Hulk Smash, Fortnite thing, and Portal, and I would have been happy. It was a little cheesy at the end with the guy and the girl coming together in the street, like, she really didn't see or get these clues all along that this person was into her? Solid movie though, will watch again.",p3ebrt
h9qc53x,"Loved, that when the city disappeared, there were clouds underneath.
No black void, no green lines. They actually made it a skybox. I love these little details!",p3ebrt
hey6enu,"Is it just me or was the first twenty minutes of the movie almost entirely a rip-off of The Lego Movie? I mean, it tells its own story later on and the movie is really good, but the beginning was eerily similar. Guy getting up super cheery, talking to his goldfish (a plant in Lego Movie I think), watching TV, getting a coffee and singing while going to work. Then meeting a mysterious girl with highlights in her hair who he immediately falls in love with and follows into an area of the game where he shouldn't be.",p3ebrt
h94ekup,"I wasn’t going to watch this but I was in the mood of going to the theater and I was pleasantly surprised and how funny/entertaining this was, honestly the surprise of the summer.

It has heart, a very laid-back vibe, funny, geeky and a good emotional touch. It does feel like a Ryan Reynolds movie in the way that he’s such a character in real life that it seems like he’s playing himself and not *Guy* but he manages to carry the whole film.

Everyone did ok, the jokes were funny, the SW and Avengers references were cool and I would really like to see how they evolve from here.

I can see why it resonated with the audience and how it drowned TSS.

Also Free Guy is what Ready Player One (movie) wanted to achieve and failed.",p3ebrt
h8qu5p8,"This movie was delightful. It's nice sometimes to just have a positive movie. And the fact that it takes place inside a GTA clone just makes it more fun!

I don't know if it will hold up over time, but that Chris Evans cameo  was amazing.",p3ebrt
h9ri0nu,"This film had no right to be as good as it is, but darn if it isn't a crowd-pleaser! This movie knows what it is: a simple premise told in a heartfelt, visually-impressive way. The overall themes are simple to understand, but they use exaggeration and humor to make them shine. Pair that with the in-depth world-building and knowledge of video games, and you've got a great film. Who would've thought that the two best video game movies of all time both starred Ryan Reynolds?",p3ebrt
hahpibz,"I thought they did a good job making Millie and Molotovgirl seem like two different people at first.   I spent the majority of the wondering trying to figure out if they were two different actresses.       Jodie Comer really impressed here, as I had never heard of her or seen her in anything prior to this.",p3ebrt
he29y3x,This movie was so cringe,p3ebrt
he4zrve,"*Free Guy* is a visual feast but, sadly, all the ingredients were stolen from other great meals, the hero putting on a pair of sunglasses to reveal the truth about the world he lives in is a complete lift from John Carpenter's *The Live*, the video game programmer having to go into the game to find proof that the evil corporate guy stole her game is basically the plot of *Tron,* the protagonist finding out he's in a simulation is two parts *The Matrix* and one part *The Truman Show* and the whole *Grand Theft Auto* shtick had already been down in *Ralph Breaks the Internet*, also, Ryan Reynolds should not narrate a comedy for a while as it tends to make the movie sound like a *Deadpool* sequel.

That all said, Ryan Reynolds continues to be a charismatic and funny leading man and Jodie Comer I've loved since watching her in *Killing Eve*, on the other hand, Taika Waititi was simply terrible as the villain, his performance was cringe-inducing at times and the film's plot doesn't really make a lick of sense. Seriously, Jodie Comer's character espouses that people will like an online game that isn't all about killing people, and she's right, that game is called *The Sims*.

Basically, *Free Guy* is a fun and goofy movie that hasn't an original thought in its entire two-hour running time.",p3ebrt

When Millie is trying to make Guy remember everything after being rebooted, she grabs him and kisses him. According to her explanation from earlier, she shouldn’t been able to kiss him (Only he should be able to kiss her).

I laughed maybe 3 times, Ryan Reynolds just plays himself, Taika is awful, Guy’s best friend character is pointless and is just there for a cheap emotional fakeout and to check off a diversity quota while ever role that’s actually developed a bit is given to a white actor. The logic of the tech is nowhere to be found and actively distracting. The video game references are cool but the Avengers and Star Wars references are the most soulless corporate bullshit Ive ever seen. Somewhere out there there’s a guy in a suit who said “you know what those idiots love? Avengers and Star Wars! just shove those in there!” and clearly it works because many people in this thread speak highly of those moments. The action scenes were super by the numbers and seem to online be there because studios think you need giant action set pieces (wow check out this huge inception style shifting building that looks like shit for no reason).

The third act was more entertaining, but it still felt like empty thrills. Reynolds was held back by a PG-13 rating heavily. There wasn’t anything special about it to me, it had no unique style. I also found out it’s already in the works for a sequel, and I couldn’t be more mad at Disney at this current moment but that’s besides the point.

Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds once again, and his Black Best Friend's character begins and ends with that description I gave him.

Also the Guy being a love letter from the programmer... Feels off. If that programmer guy ever felt anything really serious towards the girl, he would not abandon her, and would not disbelief when she told that their code were stolen. It's not love, not even close to it.

The dialogue was cheesy and over the top at many times, the story kept going between comedy and serious every 15 minutes. The characters were bland and had no chemistry, specially Milly, Keys and Mouser. Every other character was forced in specially Buddy who was trying so hard to be Kevin Hart that it made me want Kevin to do his part.. and I hate Kevin Hart. Taika’s role was okay but I disliked it because of the premise; just switch off the damn game…

Most “gamer” movies can tend to be VERY cringeworthy, but surprisingly this movie was done in a way to avoid most of those pitfalls.

Fast pace, great acting, quite interesting plot. I just really enjoyed it. I'm surprised how well they managed to make sitting behind a pc pretty interesting. Some of the humor really missed the mark for me (feel like it was really targeted towards a younger audience, I'm a grown adult) such as the Dude, Antwan or Buddy characters.

It tried too hard, the plot was nonsense, the characters we're annoying and tropey as hell...like of course it was going for a lot of that and trying to be tongue in cheek, but it just felt really douchey and patronizing to me after like 10 minutes. It's just such a stupid ass movie to me...at least Joe Keery gets a huge payday. I love that guy. The special effects were also amazing, and it's a really CGI heavy movie, which I guess is okay because the CGI in movies these days are insane. 

If you have any question if you'd enjoy this movie and it's meant for you...there's a scene when Antwan says ""whatchoo talkin' about Willis"" as a quick retort...if you find that sort of shit funny, then you'd probably enjoy the movie as the dialogue is sort of like Big Bang Theory, every character feels like they're written by the same dude and they all have that snappy sitcom-style delivery...but for me, I sat there for like 15 seconds trying to recover from the awkward cringe moment of a Different Strokes reference in a video game movie...cause you know, video gamers LOVE Different Strokes! The movie fucking sucked ass...and I feel brain hemorrhaging reading the comments of people who enjoyed it. Not that RT is even relevant in any capacity, but I was shocked to see a fucking 80%+ on the site when I was absolutely sure it'd have like a 15%...maybe I just haven't seen TRULY bad movies, but fuck if this doesn't take the cake for me in recent memory and I've just watched Hellraiser 1...okay jk nothing is worse than that movie.

As I was watching this I was being reminded of other movies. Truman Show, Lego Movie, They Live, Ready Player One,, Tron, etc. The concepts in this movie were nothing fresh and if you haven't seen the listed movies you might think it's a solid go at them. But being familiar with all the movies it borrowed from I could see that it wasn't doing those concepts any better than those movies. 

That said, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the third act. It surprises you by having some heart.. This movie relies heavily on the romance plot which felt extra cheesy. But it did make for a cute, if very predictable, ending. And the final action sequence of Guy fighting Dude was fun enough if you're into movies that constantly reference other movies. 

My main beef here is that this just feels very derivative. The idea of an NPC gaining awareness feels like it would have been interesting maybe a decade ago and videogames and devs in this movie are so castrated and romanticized here that i can't imagine any actual videogame lovers or devs getting into it despite the fortnite dances and Portal guns. 

Overall I'd probably give this a solid 6/10. The cast and cameos are fun enough to keep you watching until the end but I can't imagine revisiting this any time soon. Fun scenes like Channing Tatum as a streamer were welcome but not quite enough.",p3ebrt

I kept thinking about Ready Player One and found myself comparing the two in my head and I came to this: RPO stumbled over its own two feet so Free Guy could run.

Whoever's idea it was to put the data center (those racks looked more like a DC than a server room, so that's what I'm gonna call it) on the ground floor adjacent to the building's lobby should be fired. /s

Damn I love this movie. It has Taika Waititi, Jodie Comer and Joe Keery, so even if I really didnt like Ryan Reynolds (which I do), that wouldn't have been a deal breaker.

It was one of those rare movies where I didn't have a clear storyline/setting that I prefer over the other. I enjoyed real world scenes and Free City scenes equally.

The cast worked fantastic together. I loved Buddy. I have more to say so I'll be back later

Edit to add more thoughts:
Anyway, Buddy was a great character. He made me so happy, when he respawned in the new world I almost cried with relief. I was hoping to see Goldie but I didnt spot him, so I may have to accept that Goldie wasn't an NPC, just an object. But the cats were there, so.... 

I thought this movie was excellently paced. Each stage was long enough to be enjoyable and get maximum value without dragging on. I definitely wanted it to be longer because I was having fun, not because I was unsatisfied. 

CHRIS EVANS! What a moment. I was on the lookout for the Avengers star cameo but didn't know it was Chris so as soon as I saw Capts shield I was like.... it's gotta be.. and boom there he was haha. Loved it

I can't really fault it? Even the romance didn't cringe me out. I thought it was sweet. 

I liked slash cared about every character. I laughed at least once every one or two minutes. I left the cinema in a good mood which is all
I ask for. Kinda like when I left The Suicide Squad, super overwhelmed by how much I enjoyed it",p3ebrt

hbbkd9v,"This was watered down Westworld with a sprinkle of Truman Show. 

The good: some jokes landed very well and were genuinely unexpected (eg Chris Evans, the two seconds Wrecking Ball played)

The bad: it didn’t delve deep enough in the thought of what actually makes us human and what is really life, instead it went the safe boring, corporate route. Like the properties it leaned on most, Westworld and Truman Show, really dive into that and really force us the audience to think. Free Guy was the fortune cookie equivalent of those- light, vanilla, and you think for like two seconds before moving on to literally anything else. Also the random twitch and YouTube cameos were so forced and genuinely awful- why is it AWAYS Jack?",p3ebrt

Both Reynolds and Comer were great, and whilst I don't usually care for romance much I thought their chemistry was so brilliant and this was so beautifully done. I do kinda wish they swapped round the reunion scene and the kiss for that final shot, but you can't have it all.

I loved that it wore its influences (Truman Show, Groundhog Day, They Live) on its sleeve, and managed to make a completely wholesome film without having to dull it down with politically correct wokeness. Just true wholesome fun 😁

It got better and funnier as it went. Evans' cameo was great. Reynolds is Reynolds. For me he's always fun to watch. There have been plenty of actors who made their name playing themselves. Looking at you Harrison Ford.

This is the only time this happens. So I'm curious if anyone knows what's up with it.

For example, there is no UI in the game, this is amateur, every game has a UI and not putting one in makes it obvious how its not a real video game. 

And the Keys character talks about how their AI made the game what it is, but the AI dont start acting like AI until Guy wakes up. The game isn't successful because of their AI, there AI doesn't do shit for the majority of the film. There is so much they could have done with this, instead they focused way to heavily on Guy and Molotov girl.

To top it off, when Walter gets home, his reaction is to watch it with interest, only noticing Millie after it ends.

I still liked the movie, though.  I'm all for any movie that mocks tropes as much as it falls into them.  It's no *Truman Show* but it still hits home.

The man gets asses in seats, though. My theater was packed for a pandemic Thursday IMAX screening. Surprised to see three times the crowd and five times the laughter compared to Suicide Squad last week, I’d have bet money that would have been opposite.

Movie was fine, a bit hand wavy with the logic of the world and technical details. Tons of fast typing, Hollywood hacking. The female lead was great, haven’t seen her before. She was a believable programmer (except… she… wasn’t? Idk what she *actually did* for the company, Steve seemed to be the actual doer. Kinda disappointing that she didn’t bring much technically to the real world aside from being the recipient of unrequited love).

Taika had some awful lines. Basically a better looking version of the villian in Grandma’s Boy.

My theater thought the whole “nerdy gamer living at home” thing was hilarious. Felt like an easy joke to make, there’s a handful of those moments.

I found the inclusion of Corsair, Logitech, and Razer gear interesting.

6.5/10, glad I’ll stop seeing trailers now.",p3ebrt

h8yn4nd,"As an avid gamer of every console I and my Fortnite addicted little sister hated it. We saw The Suicide Squad though like 2 days before so the bar was set incredibly high due to that.

This in way felt like a really cheap and uninspired Ready Player One.

Why was there a Halo mantis and Scorpion tank just cgiing about without context yet they didn't make an effort at referencing tons of games if other brands are supposedly roming in this game world but aren't?

I mean sure there is the star wars and portal stuff in that one Dude fight but during the whole GTA action in the background it was like watching a bland CoD advert or that Xbox finger gun train station ad.

Channing was great in it and seems to do really well with improv with they let him off the leash. He'd do really well in his own big movie like Chris Hemsworth's Thor if they just believed in him.

The romance stuff was really stupid to me and honestly I spent a lot of the film really feeling like that wasted so much potential at championing artificial intelligence that the connections between what is life but this wasn't a smart film like Her.

It was kind of like a dumb filler summer movie that took the good from Lego movie, Truman Show and Ready Player One but in no way excelled at any of the three.

Game development side: a game build is an executable file that runs the game. No published game would keep that whole build inside of the game that is updated frequently. Also the team is very big and should be able to find the files whenever they refactor the game for optimization and lowering file size. Also when the ceo of the company was trying to shutdown the servers he could’ve flipped the breaker and shut off power to the servers and it would have ended it instantly. Also why was there one game client for the whole world, it showed streamers from across the US on one single game client that was still being shared by other 3rd world countries, logically they should have hundreds of different servers around the globe that shouldn’t be connected. And if there was a single game client on it wouldn’t be spread across all of those servers it would be on a single computer and breaking each of the computers would either break the game or do nothing, not destroy parts of the world.",p3ebrt
h8xmen3,"Movie was funny enough to mostly justify the price of a ticket.

Fan service to video game fans. They shoved a melange of references into the movie. Ryan Reynolds did Ryan Reynolds things. Some of the tropes were overplayed, probably intentionally.

The plot was predicated on the main characters being dumb as shit. There were undoubtedly easier ways to get proof of what they needed. The deal at the end was so prolifically stupid that no one in their right mind would take it.

They crammed a lot of woke/SJW bullshit into the movie too. Apparently going to MIT, getting saddled with student debt, having your life's work stolen, then working for a middling salary for the guy who stole your shit is white privilege? Who knew.

I laughed at and with a lot of it, I thought the parts of the movie that leaned into Reynolds's charisma worked and I thought that the parts of the movie that leaned into the Truman Show stuff worked even better. There is a version of that script somewhere in the multiverse that absolutely rules. Unfortunately, huge swaths of this movie were basically unwatchable. Pretty much every single scene in the real world was hard to sit through, the parts of the movie where they clearly just wanted to have the rights to Fortnite were hard to sit through, some chunks of the romance subplot were hard to sit through.

\- I really liked most of the cameos and special appearances here. This includes Antwan, who wasn't advertised IIRC, but I knew they'd be someone special once they started namedropping him. The one aspect I wasn't a fan of was >!the integration of real-world Twitch/Youtube stars. I know guys simp for Pokimane and love Ninja despite him being a moron, but seeing these people took me out of the movie!<.

\- Jodie Comer is hot as fuck, both her ingame avatar and the real person. I know basically every actor is hot, but this is the first thing I've seen her in, so I'm gonna mention it.

\- Wasn't expecting the movie to bring the feels later on, but it did. Every great movie needs some kind of emotional weight, and at first I had a feeling this would be all comedy, but thankfully it was not. Ryan's acting is still a little hokey even in these moments, but that's okay, it can't get too serious.

\- Really glad they ended it the way they did. I had a feeling they were gonna stop it at a certain point for laughs, but no, they gave us the happy ending we probably needed. But in real life >!Keys and Millie would've hooked up ages ago. Come on, she's too smart to be that oblivious.!<",p3ebrt

h90c80b,"On the way home from this movie, I saw the window for a sequel's plot. Upon arriving home and finding the sequel had already been desired by Disney, I figured I should share my barebones idea.

Basically, life is as it should be in Free Life. Citizens live, work, and drink coffee with whatever they want. As we saw in the end, Mills still has the ability to log in as a player. She doesn't do so for quite some time, letting the city grow and the AI evolve. Eventually, someone (maybe Waititi's character) figures out Mills's account info and logs in to find complete access.

 With this, they begin twisting the minds of Free Life's citizens via persuasion and propaganda, turning them to the ideals of the players in Free City (violence, robbery, etc). This creates a clear 2 sides, corrupted and pure. Now, Mills can still access the account, but has no way of preventing the 'hacker' from doing so. In the real world, it's plastered on the news that Free Life has begun to experience warfare between NPCs, drawing attention to it. People cry out for the famous Blue Shirt Guy to save it again, and he tries.

Tries and fails, that is. One man isn't enough to stop them, but he doesn't fall prey to being corrupted. Rather, his buddy, Buddy, takes a hit that would've killed Guy's character (taking Buddy out of the picture). This sends Guy spiraling in only a way where (probably) Mills helps him recover mentally despite having limited time to log in to do so. Back on the opposing side (corrupted) they're amassing weapons under the instruction of 'hacker' in Mills account, basically prepping Mills to be a 'boss' of sorts with gear and abilities. This brings us to the final part.

With his best friend dead and his.. mentor? Ex-lover? Inconsistent at best, Guy has to help save Free Life before the corruption takes it. Still demoralized, he goes to face the 'hacker' boss only to be stopped at the gate by a security guard. His best friend, Buddy. Buddy flickers in and out, clearly being killed by Corruption has changed him in some way, but he's still there. Like a programming error. Buddy doesn't stop Guy, but instead doesn't interact at all, saying something like ""I'm not your buddy, guy. I'm just Buddy."" This fills Guy with anger, motivating him to the final fight. Against Millie's avatar. As the protagonist, he wins after a dramatic battle, probably with some quote.

h9b6zof,"Light-hearted fun. Definitely not a masterpiece, and you'll probably forget most of it within a couple days, but its an easy and mostly entertaining two hours. 

The plot is pretty predictable, but that's not why anyone goes to see a movie like this. They go for the comedy and the action. As far as the comedy goes, Reynolds has carved out his comedic lane in Hollywood, and while he re-hashes a lot of what made Deadpool fun, the schtick hasn't grown completely tired yet. It's a pretty broad comedy, but there's enough there for every one to get a least a few genuine laughs in.

The action wasn't that bad either. Some of the choreography was fresh and they play with the world they've created in unique ways. Unfortunately, the CGI can be obnoxious. It follows the recent trend of jam packing every frame with as much crap as possible. It makes it difficult to appreciate or comprehend everything that is on screen.

Comer and Keary are fine in their roles. I believed Comer as herself more than I believed her as MolotovGirl, but that is to be expected. I love Waititi, but his performance came across as if he was on set for a week and they didn't have much for him on the page, so he just took it to eleven for fun. If it is a one off role like that, it's fine, but if that's the kind of acting we can expect from him in the future I might be a little worried. Tatum was fun. His dancing history allows his character to do some fun physical comedy that others can't.

Overall, it's a light piece of entertainment that you'll enjoy but probably not love. Worth the price of admission, but could probably wait for it to hit Disney+.  I'd give it 6.5 out of 10.",p3ebrt

I feel like characters in well written TV shows are far more nuanced nowadays, but then movies like this come by and have very one dimensional characters like Antoine. Other clichés to me were main guy forgets everything but is able to quickly remember everything, extreme pandering, running away from city being destroyed but still having time to give best friend a proper good bye and of course the main characters falling in love in the end.

Thye could have taken the npc becomes self aware thing to so many places, but instead it ends with the coders behind it falling in love, and in true Hollywood fashion. I was almost waiting for Keys dying and Millie having a permanent relationship with keys through Guy, but that would have been too much.

It was OK, but I wouldn't praise it too much. Yes, Ryan Reynolds plays himself/Deadpool for a millionth time, but it actually kinda fits in this movie, so I wasn't bothered by it, unlike Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard. Kudos to the director and whoever was responsible for the scene composition, it was really funny to focus on all the little stuff that happens in the background.

My main complaint is with the running time, 2h was too much. I felt the movie dragged a little bit, especially in the 2nd act.

On the surface it looks like a sprawling open world full of fun and interesting characters, you hop in only to discover it’s anything but. The world is sprawling but empty and lifeless. Filled with side quests of boring and tired sub plots like a love story between nerdy guy and his female friend who’s clueless of his feelings. Big studio cash grab full of nothing but crap. Instead of charging u 3 dollars per skin of some other video game reference that u can show off to your friends, the movie just fills it’s time with pointless references to them. (2 major examples I wont spoil but made me want to leave the theater) If I told you part of the movie was SEVERAL cameos from Ninja, Pokimane, and other twitch streamers commenting on what’s happening in the movie as of you were watching twitch would that sound like a movie that believes it’s good?

Firstly, the writing was really, really bad, like, script-wise and plot-wise also. There are a ton of inconsistencies and just straight up head-scratchers that it was hard to turn a blind eye to.On top of that, I'm absolutely floored by how poorly this movie understood video games, the game industry, game development and game media.

The cherry on top was the forced political crap about gender and race that it seems almost every movie and tv show has to share an opinion on.

The one redeeming quality in this turd? The Chris Evans cameo.Maybe that conversation with ""Buddy"" about *meaning* also, that was surprisingly touching.

The thing is, I don't actually mind Reynolds. Sure, his type-casting is getting a bit old now, but I enjoyed Red Notice, a little (6 Underground was actually really good, partly because of Storror).

It's not the most clever thing , but after movies like , Pixels,and Ready player one, that are about  nothing but Gaming reference and the hero's are the gamers, it's interesting to see a movie focus on the lives of Game developers and actually criticize the industry rather then those in the community",p3ebrt

A cool premise that felt like Tron/The Matrix mixed with They Live. Sure, there were lots of gamer references (I lost it when the guy was jumping into the wall in the background) but equally lots of subtle references to similar past movies too (spin on the bike, put on the glasses, etc.).

As someone who usually find movies with tons of CG to be visually dull, I really liked it here and felt it really captured the video game feel. I also appreciate that it was pleasant to watch! What do I mean? I've tried to watch Ready Player One twice and both times had to stop about ten minutes in from massive motion sickness. I am so glad Free Guy gave me nothing of the sort!

Only negative for me was that towards the end, the focus shifted from Guy to the real world story a bit too much for my tastes; I really didn't care that much about the real world romance and kind of wanted Millie to awkwardly date Guy instead, showing he was fully ""real"" despite loving in a different world.

Taika felt like he was in a different movie, despite being absolutely hilarious. A Dillinger for today's corporate era? I kind of wish he'd got a similar ending; just see him sitting quietly in his office as Free City 2 bombs and loses players/money.",p3ebrt

Also guy smart enough to make a real true ai and they use it on a fucking game

Shit like the dev character being able create ramps and shit but not able to just transfer them to their ""base code""

Also the reflection thing was cool but could have been explained with a sky box,like what happens in gmod (which they referenced) but instead it was a shitty ""this place is really far away but reflections weren't scrubbed"" like stfu there are reflections on all the cars and glasses",p3ebrt

Also, that the nature of the human experience is not meant to be about subjugation, or being a background player yoked to the mundanity of your own existence, but to realize life isn't about work, but leisure... and ""doing whatever you want"" ie not being anchored to the notion you will never ""level up"" and are at a society level ""stasis"" where you watch a ruling class level up, ignore laws, and mod reality with impunity.

h9u0iy1,It was in the trailer and... yeah :(,p3ebrt
h8zb3nk,Have a Nice one guy!,p3ebrt
hf8rtnj,Always gets me,p3ebrt
h8zedkv,"Yeah, it was smart to show them also slowly becoming self aware after another NPC brought it to their attention.",p3ebrt
h8r3qdb,Learned to make a cappuccino and wrote a memoir…more than I’ve done during quarantine!,p3ebrt
h98n9ga,"I'd also make an argument that there was a potential romance that they edited out. When the bombshell character makes the comment about not needing men at all, and the celebration of the NPCs on the top of the tower, it looks like they cut away from the barista character kissing bombshell on the cheek...",p3ebrt
haixsra,"IDK, I think it's a bit sudden after everyone in the shop practically threatened to kill Guy for ordering a different kind of coffee. The cop even said ""someone's about to get shot"".",p3ebrt
h9d69f6,The guy with his hands up finally put them down in the next game too!,p3ebrt
ha3hqyv,I liked that they started to evolve after interactions with Guy. Made it look like evolution was contagious.,p3ebrt
hemt6rs,"This was a black mirror showing how individual enlightenment is also collective enlightenment or spiritual awakening. That as we progress on our journey, we can inspire others. 

The high level of spiritual knowledge also shows that their agenda is very deep. In many ways this was a dunk on all us NPCs still buying their shit. 

As soon as we stop giving a shit about their money, and be guided by our own purpose and values, we will have abundance find true Life Itself.",p3ebrt
h9d2j36,Can't lie her friend had some nice bangers,p3ebrt
hzco57m,"> the bombshell companion

oh yeah...",p3ebrt
h8vmacy,It made me want to see more well done bromance movies :(,p3ebrt
h9ew62d,"Buddy is the heart of the film for me. He is essentially the Guy of the Free Guy film. He's the background character who has his own emotional growth in the film instead of the game. He has the emotional intelligence to give a really thoughtful answer when Guy basically asks him what's the meaning of life and best of all, he's just a good friend.",p3ebrt
h9brpz8,"Yup, I really appreciated the character development in this movie.",p3ebrt
he9aflg,What's so special about Taika? His movies are popular in NZ for some reason?,p3ebrt
hgtqpe7,"I'd say their relationship was shown to be more important, their embrace was shown on screen longer, the other was cut a frame short even I think.",p3ebrt
h92vhvo,I just like that they incorporated real world people in a way that isn't horribly cringy like most movies do.,p3ebrt
h8xmf92,Ok wait who are those names tho now i feel hella old,p3ebrt
h95tv68,"My 70 year old dad was more excited about Ninja than I was. Apparently, he knows him from Raid: Shadow Legends.",p3ebrt
h9rirqx,"When the streamers started appearing, I said to myself, ""Ah, I bet PewDiePie shows up."" Then I realized I wouldn't recognize him if he did because I've only ever heard of him, but I don't know what he actually looks like. Then I felt old and irrelevant lol.",p3ebrt
h9de2ub,Super surprised they didn’t get Markiplier. Seems like he’d be the single most recognizable one.,p3ebrt
h9d15t1,The only one I knew was DanTDM cuz my kid was obsessed with him a few years ago. Gotta say it was kinda cool even for me to see a Youtuber I knew.,p3ebrt
hep4r76,"I have no idea who they are, but I do feel they are **somebody** based on the amount of screen time they got.",p3ebrt
heqbbnc,Who?,p3ebrt
hg4wins,So glad Charlie decided not to be in the film,p3ebrt
h94oz41,"That was a really nice reveal! It's a real bug that happens in games, so it felt authentic. You can tell the writers actually play and love video games. But it also explained a little habit Guy had earlier in the movie. Nice payoff.",p3ebrt
h9eqd63,I don't think that was supposed to be real time reflections' but more the standard cube map reflection box that most games use.,p3ebrt
h8vyt8i,Did the game have RTX? The graphics didn't seem that amazing honestly,p3ebrt
h8uzbnl,The director I think made this movie based on the mafia boss meme,p3ebrt
hacrsqn,Lol I got that vibe too. I'm completely guessing but I feel like it could've been a reference to the in-engine ads vs in-game graphics disparity some games have,p3ebrt
h93ooea,Nah mate. Look at the orbs. Totally a Crackdown movie. ;),p3ebrt
hcrqhtu,Too PG-13 for Saints Row. Not enough dildo-themed weapons,p3ebrt
i1lcihh,If only they could have played the San Andreas theme or Kanye West's POWER somewhere...,p3ebrt
h92y0dj,"I honestly might have to agree. I had a blast with this, had me hooked from start to finish!",p3ebrt
ha587ez,"James Gunn's The Suicide Squad is the best flick of the summer IMO, but this definitely deserves the 2nd spot (and I loved the hell out of it).",p3ebrt
h9x36gx,"It is! At least for me it is. I watched the Suicide Squad a couple of weeks ago and and I didn't expect this one to be better. Life has been a bit heavy for me recently but after watching the film, I felt great for the first time in a while. I didn't have a nice day, I had a great day:)",p3ebrt
h9141f1,In what world is this movie original. It’s literally the plot of the Lego movie.,p3ebrt
i1lclan,"PUT THE GLASSES ON!

THEY LIVE! WE SLEEP!",p3ebrt
h8sk5ou,"Taika seemed to improvise his lines a lot but man, they did not fit with his douchey character.",p3ebrt
h8uhfa3,The ass and balls cancer. Inoperable! Got the biggest laugh from me,p3ebrt
h8xzgt8,i loved taika but this comment reminded me of jean ralphio and ben schwartz would have been perfect,p3ebrt
h8sf220,"Hope I'm not too harsh in saying this but... if Taika's not writing the role for himself, then don't cast him at all. It just didn't seem his vibe and everything felt forced.",p3ebrt
h8tozlc,This might be the first time I didn’t like Taika in a role. Aziz would have been ideal,p3ebrt
h94ojon,Or maybe Jason Mantzoukas,p3ebrt
h8vs9pn,His role in Suicide Squad as >!Ratcatcher 1!< was sweet though,p3ebrt
h8xa51y,I agree 100%. It’s actually scary how I thought the exact same thing.,p3ebrt
h8z8a7p,Dude aziz would be perfect as the role,p3ebrt
h9gczb2,"I like that! My wife’s reaction was, that was clearly supposed to be Sasha Baron Cohen in that role.",p3ebrt
h8yr9br,Aziz would have made it too Aziz. If RDJ wasn't Tony Stark he would have been great in that role.,p3ebrt
h936qjr,I dunno I felt there was always a chance Antwan could go full murderous pschopath. Aziz doesn't have that potential menace about him.,p3ebrt
h9108vi,He’s basically the same character as Aziz when he launched that startup in Parks & Rec.,p3ebrt
h9rcrwo,"That's funny because I had literally the EXACT same thought, except for Mouser rather than Antwan.",p3ebrt
h93kdb8,Agreed. Taika seemed so out of place,p3ebrt
h9vpuuq,I wish they had brought back the robot guy from grandma's boy.,p3ebrt
h9zm1mb,Will Ferrell would’ve been good too. I don’t even know if he still acts tho. Waititi just wasn’t that good,p3ebrt
hefzmrb,He really was trying way. too. hard. to be funny,p3ebrt
h900pqm,"Now that you say it, I clearly see it.

Still, Taika was funny",p3ebrt
heq8o5l,"In a similar vein, I felt like Buddy was written for Kevin Hart and they couldn't get him.",p3ebrt
h93ie9k,"Y'know, now that ya mention it, it did feel kind of off. While I know he was busy with *Quiet Place II: Quiet Harder,* I feel John Krasinski would've been **perfect** for this. >!Especially since he was already available for filming...!<",p3ebrt
he9v3gt,"Dude, I can immediately picture it. Aziz would've been perfect.",p3ebrt
hgholl0,"Agree 200%. I think Taika was the weakest part in a almost perfect film, and I'm a huge Taika fan. If the character was less cartoonish, it would be good",p3ebrt
hadsfoz,Every time he talked all I could hear is Korg,p3ebrt
hb4gjs0,"Taika was good, but yeah Aziz would have been better.",p3ebrt
hdjfe9w,"I would've loved Ninja from Die Antwoord, but he might have been too scary",p3ebrt
hhboaxb,"Oooooooh goooooood you're right. I think the few bits where Taika kinda flopped, he would've been able to smooth over a bit better.

&#x200B;

Sorry for jumping in so late, just watched it.",p3ebrt
h945prz,Its ok you can say Ready Player One,p3ebrt
hfqbk5e,There were a lot of things that distracted me in this movie too. Like how they needed to restart the whole game instead of just deleting a single NPC.,p3ebrt
h91v3jb,"Man, that dude has been typecast.",p3ebrt
h9brt9a,"Eh, I thought that was a little too gross and should have been a funny throwaway line, not repeated ten times in five seconds.",p3ebrt
h95xawg,My theater laughed pretty hard at that,p3ebrt
hf316ra,Bruh I just watched the movie on Disney + and my mum asked me to explain the joke to her,p3ebrt
hk34ljp,I do wonder if anyone actually wanks with socks in real life. Just buy a fleshlight or stick to old faithful (your hand).,p3ebrt
ha98ahg,"Not even just the intro, the whole movie. Millie being the 'Wyldstyle' character that shows 'Emmet' (Guy) he's special and not just a normal NPC, etc.",p3ebrt
h9pycr3,Down to the coffee!,p3ebrt
h9dgz4y,"If only we had gotten a musical number, that would've been hilarious.",p3ebrt
hzgq7qw,"Yes! And I literally watched Lego movie 2 the night before, the whole coffee scene is legit the same, it was kind of confusing me haha. But I loved this movie nonetheless!!",p3ebrt
h8qjwqo,Feels like the first time I’ve seen Tatum in a while,p3ebrt
h9kfn5i,"Channing Tatum changing facial expression from excited, to shouting at the mom, to dancing was golden.",p3ebrt
h9vkd37,My wife gushed about Evans and the whole time I could not stop thinking about how fucking great Tatum was. I don't laugh out loud in theaters much but he got more than one from me.,p3ebrt
hemnzq8,I only just watched the movie now. I thought it looked like him  but didn't think it was him till I went through the credits! Was **not** expecting that many cameos.,p3ebrt
h8qtgml,This movie convinced me that Joe Keery can make that rom-com male lead money like Noah Centineo,p3ebrt
h8skzx9,"Steve “The Hair” Harrington, lol. Or as I call him: Steve Hairrington.",p3ebrt
h8qjmh7,"I like to think because they cut out the film right as they were about to kiss in the middle of a street that a speeding bus tragically killed one of them just before their love could be actualized. A tragic ending, but clearly what the director was going for.",p3ebrt
h8vqydt,I was really glad they didn't leave him sidelined and had Millie go for him instead of Guy which would have been weird.,p3ebrt
h8tipsy,Ohhhh that’s where I recognized him from. Thanks,p3ebrt
hf9n3t5,Hell yeah haha! I was so pleased to see Joe Keery in a film like this with Ryan Reynolds!,p3ebrt
han91uq,he was robbed in stranger things S3!!!! robbed i say,p3ebrt
h95z8a2,They both had the nicest apartments. I was like … I don’t buy that explanation one bit.,p3ebrt
h8vtkvv,I still don't know how she kissed him... They had already discussed that there wasn't a button for that.,p3ebrt
h8tkdds,"I'm surprised Guy didn't notice it was Millie straight away. When he first started becoming sentient, all it took was a glance but when he got rebooted, he wasn't able to become sentient even after talking to her.",p3ebrt
h8viphi,I’d say it’s like a more wholesome westworld. The plots are almost exactly the same.,p3ebrt
h8yq3d2,"Lego Movie, Truman Show, Gamer, and a little bit of Elf",p3ebrt
h8v5206,"it reminded me of Ready Player One, but actually good",p3ebrt
h8z4ify,"> Imma be honset, i was a little bit disappointed Millie didn't sing the Mariah Carey song to make Guy remember but they made up for it by using it in the climax.

It annoyed me a bit because they said specifically that there was no button to use for a player to kiss another player. So while she kissed him I thought ""Wait...how did she do that?"".   The Mariah Carey song or even bubble gum ice cream would have explained it better but whatever.",p3ebrt
h9q8y3m,The way NPCs viewpoint vs humans viewing of video game graphics gave me *Kevin can f himself * vibes,p3ebrt
h92nqje,I thought it was like The Truman Show meets The Lego Movie meets a little bit of Ready Player One,p3ebrt
h92upet,I got a Pleasantville vibe out of it as well.,p3ebrt
h8zpj5l,It bothered me that she “kissed” him to wake up his memories because there was supposed to be no button in the game to do that. So how did Millie program herself to kiss Guy?,p3ebrt
h9dse0p,"Truman show is first thing that I thought of as well, but in a digital world",p3ebrt
helcnh3,"Interesting tibit, the version of Mariah Carey's song that is playing as Guy is running across the bridge was actually sung by Jodie Comer.",p3ebrt

hahoclq,I liked Black Widow better then all of them.  Maybe because it came out first and I was ready for big screen action.,p3ebrt
hi7dagf,"Oh this must have been an amazing movie to see in a full theater. It would be be great to having all those eyes and ears catching everything. 

“I may not be real but for a second I felt pretty alive.”",p3ebrt
hkejlpd,It is so funny seeing this comment now because I've just finished Jungle Cruise and currently about to finish Free Guy,p3ebrt
h8qnqhq,Probably my favorite scene just because goofy Channing is the best Channing. And while I don't care for fortnite dances they really got their money's worth getting Magic Mike himself to do them.,p3ebrt
h8ymijh,I loved that he had a Deadpool poster.,p3ebrt
h9v19v8,"""You're 22 and living in my house. There is no god"".",p3ebrt
h90s35z,Hit im with the snakey guy *wiggle wiggle wiggle*,p3ebrt
h8r7yb3,"The dialog could have been better, but it was otherwise very well executed.

Also, Matty Cardarople is great, and I hope he gets a main character role at some point.",p3ebrt
h8y3dtk,"Yeah that seemed like a tough thing for the creators to dance the line of.  How much to show that this is an actual video game vs showing the live action, and also showing the human players.  I think they did it well though.",p3ebrt
h8r1h4x,One of the funniest scenes of the movie honestly. Reminded me a lot of [WKUK](https://youtu.be/XhufrnT4818). RIP Trevor Moore.,p3ebrt
h9167sz,"If we’re thinking about the same one (near the beginning, soon after he first puts on the glasses), it was a bottle of Aviation Gin - Ryan Reynolds’ gin brand",p3ebrt
h8xm5vy,I thought being called Neutrogena in the script was a (welcomed) product placement in itself while discussing Guy’s skin,p3ebrt
h8uzgtt,"Razor, Alienware, pretty every gaming PC brand injected product placement in there",p3ebrt
h92qipm,I need to rewatch this film. All these jokes and cameos and hidden things that I missed,p3ebrt
h98yjnl,Camaro. Alienware. Disney stuff.,p3ebrt
ha96cf4,I'm not even a tech person and all that lingo made me cringe,p3ebrt
hehfck6,"Pretty much nothing made sense really. Almost every tech aspect of this movie was ""off"" at the very least. Nothing about the servers for instance makes any sense. So it seems like the whole game is just one single lobby containing every single player where different parts of the map run on different servers. Which is absolutely insane honestly and would require a map that's much bigger than the one in the movie appears to be. Also if Antwan didn't want the original map to be discovered, couldn't he just have deleted it instead of fucking hiding it in the Free City map? Any player could have found that shit easily with a glitch or a noclip cheat, that shit was retardedly risky. I'd also like to point out that every single NPC seems be a unique individual with their own unique model, audio, behavior and even unique programming. That's an insane amount of work for a GTA like game that's absolutely swarming with insignificant civillian NPC's. I might believe it if it was supposed to be a game from the future, but it isn't. This game is very strange and also way too technologically advanced to be believable as a game from today.",p3ebrt
heg404k,party pooper,p3ebrt
hocdi0k,It will be funny if they use something like AWS. Boss went to the  server room -> Nothing inside. Engineer: boss we migrated to cloud.....,p3ebrt
har0fie,"I'm not a techno person, but I had the thought of wait, if free guy too replaces everything that free guy had, then people aren't going to be happy. It takes lots of time to develop your skin and collect weapons and points and whatever else in the game.

So I could never understand why he thought people would just blindly purchase his next game based on the title alone.

But, it also proves how arrogantly stupid he was by not understanding gamers.

Like when he wore that streetwear hip hop clothing, that he was so desperately trying to fit in to show that he was worth all the money he was making off the box of other people",p3ebrt
he1p6lw,Not sure how the protagonists would have gotten access to an offsite server room.  The guy was working as game support and the girl wasn't working for the company at all.,p3ebrt
he9kond,"Im basically a boomer when it comes to most techy stuff, but I couldn’t stop thinking about this either. However I think it would be hard to completely make sense hardware and software wise with the story they wanted to tell, and they did a fairly good job of not being completely horrible with it.",p3ebrt
hyxyk8f,"These are all good points and I'm glad you pointed them out. Also, as kind of referenced in the movie, the data for an AI versus a single-phrase bot would be orders of magnitudes different. The AI would be taking up lots of process space that would definitely be noticed.    
    
That being said, the movie was fun, goofy, and happy. If I have to choose between realism and enjoy-ability (in a movie), I'm going with the latter every time.",p3ebrt
i9w7zro,"Dude it’s a movie. A popcorn flick. It’s not meant to be a landmark of literature and screenwriting that stands up to years of scrutiny that people will hold up as a masterpiece. There are flaws, which is why it’s a 6-7/10 movie by most standards. It’s ok that it’s not perfect.",p3ebrt
hen8qnx,"Nobody cares, but I guess this is why coders aren't better authors.",p3ebrt
hmb6ru9,Thank you for this. It made it such a painful watch. Also if they were suing and all they needed was video just go to that prolific Twitch streamer’s page and load up the fucking replay. The end. But as you say they would have lost anyway as they sold all of their code…,p3ebrt
iac2a2v,"Old reply, but the biggest issue is that there is zero chance there’s a single data center for an internal game supposedly that big",p3ebrt
h8yemvq,That would have been epic,p3ebrt

Still enjoyed what it became.",p3ebrt

h8ymlbh,"I had a seat kicker behind me and a group of people who kept checking Facebook on their phones in the row in front of me.

I loved the movie, but after nearly 19 months of not going to the theater, this made me remember why I'm so on board for Premier access and other streaming services.",p3ebrt
h92pmwj,"Literally felt the same goosebumps I felt when I first watched Endgame in a completely full cinema. It wasn't even half full this time but compared with how things have been over the past year, it was a lot and it reminded why I will always prefer watching films like this at the cinema than at home",p3ebrt
h9slbf4,"Free Guy brought back memories of the saga films, while staying its originality to shed new lights of video game movies. 

It’s been a year I’ve not been to a cinema since Tenet, which I re-watched three times in the cinema. 

I’m from Hongkong, the cinemas closed last year from October to April this year due to returning waves of pandemic, it's a pity a local cinema line ended their 36 years business in this period. And living in a lot of pressure in Hongkong, especially oppression of politics. This movie definitely released those negative energy in 120 mins and I enjoyed a lot.",p3ebrt
hedwwla,"My girlfriend was blowing me in the back of the theater (it was pretty empty and quiet so we could get away with it), and right when Ryan Reynolds activated that lightsaber I blasted an entire milk truck worth of cum into her throat.

h8t16o2,I thought it was setting up a comedic moment but then it just... Didn't .. was weird but whatever,p3ebrt
h9iil6p,"I thought it was about showing their facial expressions.

Keys face at first was like ""why are you here?""

Millie's face then was like ""I know what you did. ""

Keys face ""what is this.... oh...""

Millie face ""yes I know now""

""i love you""

""I love you too""

""so... are we gonna cross the street or something?""",p3ebrt
h9387ja,"Yeah, the movie already felt a little long and then they kept dragging out the end with those unnecessary scenes.

That plus all of the crowd shots from people watching in Times Square and all over the world. I swear, they cut to those shots *so many* times at the climax of the movie and it's like.... we get it",p3ebrt
h903zdc,Sane but i laughed out loud when i realised/assumed it was deliberate like a gag on romantic reunion scenes. But i guess the humour is subtle so i works understand if it flew past most audience’s minds,p3ebrt

h8vpj66,"I did a double feature today. Green Knight and Free Guy. After that slow burn and intense drama, it was nice to have a fun movie that was surprisingly even better than I thought it would be. Chris Evans cameo and the Avengers theme was fantastic. So was Channing Tatum",p3ebrt

Overall I felt this movie handle the references/cameos way better than RPO, or Space Jam 2.",p3ebrt

I have come back from just seeing the film, and this instantly hit me as the music from paperman. Not sure how many people will recognise it, but it's one of Disney's best shorts for sure.",p3ebrt
harmptx,"Thought process in the theater :  
A) ""...theses notes really sounds like the suspense part before the reveal in Paperman""  
B) ""... nice!.. it ""IS"" the same track!  
C) ... but this is not a Disney movie, how... ?  
D) ... its a 20th Century ... Fox - oh right, right....    
E) ... the rest of the movie had may more Disney's references from that point on. (I agree with one of the previous comment here)  


Since the music was used as a love theme both for Guy inside the game and for Millie in the real life I am totally fine with it and I think it was very fitting. :-)",p3ebrt
h9dt7dc,My husband instantly noticed it was the music from Paperman. Once he told me I recognized it as well but never would have connected the dots. It is his favourite Disney short I guess and he has a much better ear for music than I. Glad someone else noticed as well!,p3ebrt
h94ae8h,I listen to that track often and periodically rewatch that short. I didn’t mind that Beck used it because it’s so damn effective imo and he probably figured nearly everyone watching it wouldn’t recognize it and now it allows more people to hear it.,p3ebrt
h98k6o5,Immediately I turned to my friend and was like “Isn’t this the Paperman theme??” Every time they played it I was thrown out of the movie lol,p3ebrt
h8xmjv5,Thank you for digging this up!!,p3ebrt
h8yu3rr,Thank you for looking into this! I knew it sounded familiar but had no idea where I’d heard it. It was used well in this movie I thought. Very sweeping and romantic.,p3ebrt
h94vq38,Yeah watched this yesterday and immediately recognized it as the music from paperman.  Thought it was odd that it was reused but it was still pretty neat to hear.,p3ebrt
h9te2tl,I knew it was familiar right away too. Both from Paperman and Big Hero 6,p3ebrt
hcrrn7g,"Interesting thought: that short played before Wreck-it Ralph in 2012, a movie I think this is pretty indebted to. I wonder if that's a subtle homage. 

The score sounded a lot like Frozen to me, another Beck score. He must reuse themes in a lot of his projects.",p3ebrt
hh08q0k,Beck first got my attention as the composed for most of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. Some of his work on those shows was amazing.,p3ebrt
h8zepel,That was one of the best moments of the real world reacting to the game in the movie. I would’ve loved to see them filming that scene.,p3ebrt

h8xkmkr,It's still undeniably Ryan Reynolds but his character in this movie had no snark. Pure sentimentality. I'd say that's the opposite of his shtick. Just slathered with his same charm.,p3ebrt
h938byq,"First there was the scene where Guy tries to get his black friend to put on the glasses so he can see reality

And then there was the ""I'm here to kick ass and..."" line near the end of the movie

I got pretty strong They Live vibes from this",p3ebrt
hen4xm3,"This protagonist was more enlightened and knows that he doesn't need to force anyone else to open their third eye before they are ready in their own journey.

h8uvcwy,That’s what I liked about it. Like he clearly doesn’t get video games and probably was just a trust fund kid who got lucky stealing code,p3ebrt
h8r9bz8,"I think they were going for the ""guy who thinks he can be 'cool' if he bases his whole personality on references and stealing other people's credit"" - reminded me of an episode of New Girl where the main character gets people ten years younger than her to think she's cool by quoting catchphrases of 80s TV characters like she just came up with them.",p3ebrt
h8zq1nb,"You're not supposed to like him. I thought he was hilarious in the shit-head villain role. Him trying to ""kip-up"" after squatting on the ground killed me.",p3ebrt

h9r4ptz,"I think that was the beauty of him though...he was literally the 'how do you do fellow kids"" character that steals the hip and trendy video game and makes it his own cool thing as though he's being original. He's literally every middle aged person that's ever been like...yeah I totally know Fortnight and Mindcraft....and that was the beauty of it.

(Mispelling for effect)",p3ebrt
h8s6ocw,"I think I would have preferred a character like ""The Plague"" from Hackers.  Someone who takes themselves way to seriously and is completely oblivious to how bad it comes off.  Instead, he's poorly written as an attempted nerd trope of some sort of socially awkward, middle-management who lucked into money character.  And it didn't seem to really have an impact that a serious comedic role could have been.",p3ebrt

h8qj2q9,I love corporate synergy,p3ebrt
h8qvwdp,"Watched in South Korea. Compared to the US the movieoging experience is very reserved - not a lot of clapping or reactions from crowds which is nice.

Anyways, the moment where Chris Evans came on was the first time (aside from MCU movies which are wildly popular here) that I've seen a theater here erupt with cheering and clapping. Very pleasantly surprised with the movie.",p3ebrt
hblvaby,"Captain America worked really well with the score and Evans, but the lightsaber and reactions felt a bit forced for me personally.",p3ebrt
h8stu44,"They're enjoyable references, but I thought they undermined Taika Waititi's character somewhat - you're meant to hate this guy because he's all about *focus groups* and *sequels* and *franchises* instead of creativity and originality like Millie and Keys, but then the film drops obvious Marvel and Star Wars references into its own narrative in order to generate that kind of focus-grouped reaction from fans of those franchises that they know will be watching.",p3ebrt
h8yqx0d,Love those parts but of course some redditors won't because they're edgy.,p3ebrt
h8r1y2v,I could tell that was Jackman! And given his history with Reynolds and Levy I wouldn’t be surprised if it was indeed him (hole I was watching his “cameo”) not sure where Krasinski and The Rock were in this tho…,p3ebrt
h8rk483,"So what is the take away here?

Is it somehow impressive that these actors had voice cameos in the movie?
Sorry if I am being a bit crude, but having those guys in a scene together sounds like it would be a cool thing to see. But I fail to see how it is so with just voice cameos?
I mean, in some cases the actor doesn't even need to leave their own house for those..",p3ebrt
h8vu4v9,"Wish we got to see Buddy and Guy have their beer on the beach though. 

Also loved the npc who gets robbed had his arms up the entire time he was running from the server collapsing the world and cheering on the roof with the others. Seeing him cheer by moving his arms forward instead of up was so funny.",p3ebrt

I was expecting the same, then when they did the exact same scene in the game I was 100% expecting it to happen then they didn't... Bastards knew it.",p3ebrt

h8w8cye,"The NPC who almost always kept his arms up was one of the most hilarious background character for me. While running from when the city was being destroyed, to cheering on the roof as Guy made it across and since he wasn't pumping his fist or clapping he did a weird cheer move with his body, and everywhere else he was in.

I also liked how it seem like it was implied it was DUDE that rescued the kittens for the NPC woman who keeps losing them with him standing next to her in the shot  they were all in a line.",p3ebrt

h9qcnwt,"Over analyzation:

It's a pretty good depiction of what I conceive happens in the real world. Antwan was savy enough to become a tech giant and was aware he could use their source code for gain. The 'little guys' can have the best idea in the world but money can simplify bringing that idea to the masses. And the bigger the money, the more influence to keep growing the company

Over reaching analyzation:

Guy asks MG if she's met ""God""... And technically Antwan is God to free city. And what he says goes. He picks and chooses what ideas go green light and what gets thrown out

There comes a money point where CEOs are followed by yes men and the company has become arguably too big to fail. 'Life Itself', like so many great ideas got re purposed to make a shit load of money. Some of the greatest world inventions are not used today for their original purpose. Cutting edge AI would be immediately weaponized.

""Why watch something when you could do it yourself?"" sometimes (for better or worse) we enjoy watching others live the life we think we want. We watch TV, movies, entertainment and currently streaming is so big. The streamer cameos - they are all millionaires and adolescents through teenagers know all about them = Money (which is technically well played by the movie for including them). Everyday people 'pay' to watch people live their daily lives. **I'll be honest, if AI is on its tipping point to exponentially overcome humans, the masses would absolutely watch that Livestream**

But Antwan didn't see it that way because he didn't see money in AI becoming sentient (possibly). So instead Life Itself evolved free city. There comes a financial point where you think you're a master of the universe aka God. And what you says goes despite what a vocal division of your fanbase says. That minority group see the ceo and advisers as out of touch all day, and that same group still throws money towards them. 

Remember kids are the future. They are the dumbest smart people in the world. No kid is afraid to figure out something when nobody's watching. And similarly Keys jokes to Millie, that Guy is 4 years old. Guy went 1-100 real quick like kids with technology. Kids will enjoy what they want and if a company is lucky enough to find the kids audience = potential billion dollar company. Merchandising! Kids make businesses money through brand merchandising. Things that could get thrown away after an hour, but they still got that money.

Whether intended or not, that's how I watched *free guy*",p3ebrt
h8qlpi4,Worst part about the movie is Antwan. Every joke he said fell flat. I would’ve liked the movie better if Antwan wasn’t in the movie. Unnecessary character that didn’t make any sense.,p3ebrt

I don't like references and cameos (""hurr durr look at the popular thing"" + there was wayyyyyyyyy too many of them, like holy shit every 2 minutes). A lot of the romantic lines between Comer and Reynold's characters had me cringing out of my chair. None of the jokes were funny at all (I guess some of Antwan's lines were internally ""haha sure"" but other than that, Reynolds was shockingly and painfully unfunny in this movie). Despite being a big time gamer, I usually *hate* video game movies and this was certainly no exception, but on the bright side it seems like they understood gamers *a little better* than most movies do.

h9weezg,"> I feel like a major part of this is because the Free City video game remains poorly defined and never actually feels like a game.

That's because they were focused on making a story in a world that is relatable to the average casual gamer, like a GTA Online player or a person who has played a few open world games. Anyone who has a little more knowledge about how videogames work knows that most of the things happening don't make sense. >!If a NPC started behaving in a weird way, devs would immediatly know that it he is not a real player for multiple reasons (no account created, no login history, no ip). If the game map had another region hidden, dataminers would find it in a few days. When a sequel to an online game is released, they don't shut down the previous game but stop updating it so that people move to the newer thing because shutting it down would bring a lot of (justified) outrage from the fans. If you destroy the game servers, it won't erase all data because they most likely have backups elsewere. If you want to get rid of a specific player, just ban him...!<

I loved Channing Tatum scene with the streamer guy who lived with his mom, I actually laughed out loud at that.   I think the things that didn't work:  Taika Wattii's character felt like he was in a different movie and felt like a stock character.   The sidekick character felt like he could have used some fleshing out, although I  thought the actor did well with what he had.  Most of the final 15 minutes felt like it wasn't very tight and fell apart but I did feel some emotion when Guy told Millie that she probably should focus on romance in her real world.

h8scpn8,"I mean, I did like this movie, but man you are not wrong about any of this lmao",p3ebrt
hmb3jcy,"Me too. I finally got around to watching this and was looking forward to it from all the positive word I had seen from friends and family and this is quite possibly *the* worst movie I watched in 2021 and I watched a LOT of damn movies. Seeing Jodie Comer in The Last Duel before this made me completely unable to take her seriously in a comedic role for starters. Then we get to Ryan Reynolds being like a Flanderization of Ryan Reynolds which doesn’t exactly help things. And don’t get me started on how ridiculous and cringe Taika was; he didn’t mesh with the film whatsoever and his plot line also makes precisely 0 sense since he bought the game from them and thus owns said IP and thus there is no legal case to begin with.

For devil’s advocate’s sake, let’s say that the lawsuit plot line does hold a candle whatsoever, in the real world they could have just gone on Twitch and loaded up the clip of the out of bounds area and gone to court. The end. The dude was a Twitch streamer of massive proportions so the video would have been backed up on YouTube and other sites as well. And while we’re on this point the real world YouTubers being in this instantly took me out. It will instantly age this movie and so so many of those real world personalities have already had controversies, why would they not just make some fake ones to get the same vibe without the possibility of tarnishing the film long term? And then we get to corporate tie ins and all of the Disney stuff. I get it, shit like Fortnite does stuff like that, but holy hell did it just come off as shoehorned in fanservice as absolutely none of it had any weight on the film as a whole.

Then we get to the fact that this movie has a whole weird Disney Channel version of Her thrown in and it’s just such an odd tone clash — this is trying to be feel good yet also raising questions of how in a tech heavy world now people feel more romantically fulfilled by talking to absolutely perfect match AI rather than real humans. The entire concept is diametrically opposed to the feel good aspect and that’s why I feel like they realized they went too far and had to write themselves out of a hole there and have her go for the Stranger Things dude, but that also makes it so that they tread this whole awkward road for no reason at all again.

Oh and can’t forget all of the technical stuff. They wait forever to just… take the servers offline and reboot (could literally have just patched blue shirt guy out of the game in two seconds and gone back online) and it made me want to scream. The two workers are clearly coders yet they don’t know how to just give the two main characters no clip abilities? Or just give it to everyone so that they all can no clip out of the main area and they get all of their lawsuit evidence at once?

And then there’s the Taika destroying the server room like this isn’t something that’s distributed from multiple server rooms worldwide, none of which would *ever* be on site? Every single technical thing makes 0 sense. Hell, even Blue Shirt Guy being wiped would make no sense as he has made the transition from NPC to Player and while he doesn’t show up as a player, his stats and such and memories would still be getting written *somewhere* to a database as player data, which is always backed up and saved between reboots in online games.

Can’t forget the pointless scene with all of the NPCs as well that were just rebooted and somehow remember their character arcs despite just being reset just like Blue Shirt Guy.

The complete and total lack of *any* semblance of caring about making any sense in either real world or in universe rules just drove me insane. When every single thing that happens can have such easy to get to alternate solutions that actually make sense it also just makes it an absurdly frustrating watch for viewers. I wanted to let myself go and enjoy the ride, but this just gave me no ability to even do that.",p3ebrt

On the one hand they say ""Free City is so popular because the stolen AI code made the NPCs super realistic"" yet it constantly mocks how stuck in a loop every npc is until the events of  movie start, shortly before the game is to be shut down.

Everyone assumes Guy is a player using an NPC skin because NPCs don't act like he does. The players are obviously use to the game having bog standard NPC automatons.

Even Millie, who is looking for proof that their code was used in the game, is introduced by mocking the robotic dialog of Free City's NPCs and doesn't recognize her AI code in Guys actions, instead she's looking for hidden environmental assets. Granted that is more concrete proof that the code was used than observing how the AI behaves, but she doesn't even seem to consider that the NPCs are running her AI code.

[Brad Pitt for Deadpool 2 asked a cup of coffee as payment](https://collider.com/deadpool-2-cameos/#images). Unless it was just a joke and he did get a small monetary payment too that they didn't disclose. 

>I believe if you blink, you will miss a Brad Pitt cameo. Can you confirm that's Brad, and how the hell did you get him for the movie? 

>REYNOLDS: Well, I can confirm that that is Brad Pitt. I still don't even know how we got him for the movie. I just wrote him a letter, and explained what it was we were doing. And the sort of premise behind it was how do we, what's the most wasteful way to use the biggest movie star in the world? And it was through a character that is largely invisible and worthless throughout the movie. And then just having him show up for eight frames of footage. And I guess Brad found that funny, we all found that funny. And he said, yes. And the next thing you know he came and shot for about seven minutes. It took him longer to drink the coffee that he requested as payment. 

Vin Diesel negotiated for his cameo in Fast and Furious 3: Tokyo Drift that he would get the rights of Riddick for the appearance. 


>[It goes like this. After “Chronicles,” they said, “We are out of the Riddick business. It’s just a straight business calculation of us. You spent too much money and you didn’t make enough back. So, no, we’re not going to do anymore.” Vin, being the savvy guy he is, said, “Well, give me the rights back.” And they didn’t want to do that ... I think this was about the time that “Fast 3” had already shot and they were testing it. Maybe it wasn’t testing as well as it should have and they decide, “Maybe we need a cameo from Vin” — because he wasn’t in that movie. So, I do believe that in his savviness, Vin said, “Don’t pay me for that cameo. Just give me the rights back.” So, his company basically controls the rights and because I control all of the sequels and remakes. So, we can’t make a movie without each other, nor would we want to. So, that’s how he got the rights back and I think that was a great business move.](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/david-twohy-riddick_n_3860636?utm_hp_ref=entertainment)

h90pq28,"While it was obnoxious RPO made sense in regards to its world building. Free Guy literally has two Halo vehicles wandering around the city but with no context when everything else bar the Dude fight was just lazy gun battles.

This uses the staple of a romance plot to the near pint point copy of Ready Player which in of itself was so corny and stupid. You literally have some intelligent woman in this goggling over a man kissing her character when a scene ago we are being sold that she can't be swooned that easily.

Why this film had to be about some really really dumb love story intertwined with a utopia hidden behind a dystopia that didn't even look better than Free City while also having Key's implementation of endlessly looking for the perfect girl that is right in front of him be a waste anyway when his character development isn't even about being in love with said girl and so the romance isn't earned at the very end.

There are better movies that do action to a more exciting extent and as noted there are better movies in my opinion that do fan service to a better bar of creativity. 

It doesn't matter what the story is revolving around as this was a video game movie and it barely had any video game references for us to sit up in our chair like DiCaprio because either there wasn't a budget or they just got lazy thus the weird halo vehicles bobbing around not doing anything.

There are plenty of games that have done the 2d plane health bar 1v1 fight. MGS4 and Death Stranding being great little nod examples.

I think that would have been cool when you literally have a david vs goliath 1v1 fight happening yet they resort to low brow references like..a light saber, CA shield and a hulk hand? They aren't even video game references in context just Disney connected branding.

Why not a hadouken or Red Faction unicorn butthole laser gun instead of a stupid fortnite mallet.

It just could have done sooooooo much better in terms of its homages and it makes me sad as we probably won't get another movie like this for many years.

Why couldn't the bubble gum ice cream have been something dappy like giant roast chicken venders ala Castlevania. Just daft shit like that so the world doesn't feel like a boring replication of our own when again you for some stupid reason have Halo, Star Wars and Marvel stuff contained within the supposed video game world.

For the supposedly most perfect and best selling game ever it really didn't aspire to be much in terms of what it was selling.

Heck RPO did enough research to even implement a holy hand grenade which would have been awesome in Free Guy. The library of content in the video game industry is so vast in terms of weaponry that for a film about killing each other in a city of freedom they all just have glocks, assault rifles and shotguns. Just seems like lazy research on the makers part.",p3ebrt

helktyy,"> ""Free City is so popular because the stolen AI code made the NPCs super realistic""

Don't think that's what the script says. Hold on, lemme [dig out the line](https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/movies/free-guy-2021-transcript/) - 


>""How can I move on? How can you? Antwan swiped our AI engine to use in his dumb shooter.

>""Did he, Millie? Because honestly, I’m not so sure. Our game was complex and beautiful and interesting and Free City, it may be popular, but it’s so idiotic, it makes me wanna cry.

So I think the implication is the code wasn't meant to be used for the NPC's, it was used for environment/item generation in the game, which puts it a step above any similar game on the market. 

>I’m saying that our game, Life Itself, where characters would grow and change and feel real…

>Yeah?

>…worked.

>Keys.

>The AI worked.

>It’s the reason why Free City is so realistic and people love it so much.

I suppose Anton thought he could get away with AI generated items and environments, but AI NPC's was a step too far, hence why the NPC's are all given the usual rote lines.

I'm only addressing this because I was specifically looking to pick apart things like this on my watch.

It's all a little hand-wavey, but as far as movies about tech go, this one clearly had consultants that gave a shit. It's like how in *Mr. Robot* all the hacking is sped up but still realistic, I appreciate the attention to detail.",p3ebrt

There was also something about the way the Bombshell girl first became self aware after talking to Guy. He told her she didn’t have to be forced to be around bad dudes. And she started becoming self aware and made a comment along the lines of “you’re right I don’t need to keep being around bad men. or even being around men at all!” So I def got the vibes that there was a potentially cut romance subplot between those two.

There was something special about it and I didn't realise how special that was until this past year when all of that went away.

I agree that I don't want people whooping, clapping, cheering, laughing, crying at every film I go to. But it was a special experience and I'm glad I got to have it.

I don't know if that energy will ever be matched by anything I experience in my life. I hope it will.

The Guy character could just as easily been turned into one of those “virtual assistants” from Black Mirror who are fully sentient but trapped inside a cube for eternity to complete boring tasks for their human overlords.

Another part I liked was how they made parallels between the AI in the game and real life. We look at these NPCs and laugh at their lack of free will and how they repeat the same routine every day, but then once you step back and look at your own life you also wake up, eat, and go to work every day with little variation.

h91ftr3,"> While it was obnoxious RPO made sense in regards to its world building. Free Guy literally has two Halo vehicles wandering around the city but with no context when everything else bar the Dude fight was just lazy gun battles.

It had nothing to do with world building. It was using other properties to gin up interest in the story.

> This uses the staple of a romance plot to the near pint point copy of Ready Player which in of itself was so corny and stupid. You literally have some intelligent woman in this goggling over a man kissing her character when a scene ago we are being sold that she can't be swooned that easily.

Not sure what scene you’re referencing at the end, or that you understood the appeal she saw in the character.

> Why this film had to be about some really really dumb love story intertwined with a utopia hidden behind a dystopia that didn't even look better than Free City while also having Key's implementation of endlessly looking for the perfect girl that is right in front of him be a waste anyway when his character development isn't even about being in love with said girl and so the romance isn't earned at the very end.

Dude, what? You need to use some punctuation. 

> It doesn't matter what the story is revolving around as this was a video game movie and it barely had any video game references for us to sit up in our chair like DiCaprio

…guy, the point of the movie isn’t to be a repository of references. That is literally the problem people have with RPO - that’s *all it is*. This movie had mostly subtle cameo moments with a couple big ones at the end which actually felt earned. 

> Why not a hadouken or Red Faction unicorn butthole laser gun instead of a stupid fortnite mallet.

Yes, why would they reference one of if not the most well known game around instead of… Red Faction, a b-list series that - while I like it - hadn’t had a game released in a decade. 

Your problem with this movie seems to come down to it not having enough references and that the ones it had didn’t match what you like.

h9vckb4,"So the way reflections used to work before RTX reflections and realtime raytracing became reasonably possible in video games, Game developers used to use something called Cubemaps.

Cubemaps are like a 360 degree screenshot of an environment that you would apply as either a skybox or just as a reflection to all objects within an environment. This would make objects look like it's reflecting the environment around it.

So when you play an older game (for example most halo games) and come across a shiny object that is reflecting its environment, you're looking at a cubemap.

So to explain the reference, sometimes levels get cut, however the cubemaps generated from them remain uncut and occasionally a developer would decide to use that cubemap in a different environment simply because they like the lighting or they fit the environment better.

&#x200B;

Here's an example in halo 4 of a halo 3 cubemap being used as a reflection:

hf3kkkn,"graphics in game take computer power to realize. So, if you were to calculate accurate reflections every time, it would take a lot of power.   


One of the most common shortcuts developers could use (there are many ways to do this) is to precalculate and create a 2d image of what the reflection should be in that place then make the game move that image according to the camera position, so that it looks like there is a real reflection.   


Problem is that being that 2d image precalculated, it isn't interactive: e.g. if you move a chair in a place and it should be reflected, that chair isn't going to appear unless you recreate that 2d image. Or, oppositely, if you were remove a chair, that chair is still going to be reflected.  


What happened in Free Guys is that developers removed the island and then placed a city instead, forgetting to update the 2d image from specifically the blindfolds of the apartments.",p3ebrt

At its core, this is a dumb movie that does indeed have a lot of silly jokes. It is brainless entertainment.

I don't think it was an afterthought, but I do believe that, as you say, the movie was more worried about entertaining than telling a deep story.

My main point is that the film was far from perfect and it’s ok to analyze it and point out its faults but at the end of the day it was still a fun movie to me and those faults didn’t ruin it because I didn’t have too high expectations to begin with. 

But I completely understand where you’re coming from, I have a similar mind in that I analyze a lot of things but the people that call something like this straight up trash for that are being a bit absurd imo but are entitled to their opinion.",p3ebrt

We are already witness the mass death that comes with our technological hubris. We are not god, and can never create a true consciousness in a machine. Humans cannot work with AI to build a better world.  
If you don't understand this, do more spiritual work on raising your consciousness.

ha05q1s,"okay. So a long long time ago, in video games you can't buy today, Game developers looked at shiny metal balls and thought ""This needs a reflection!"" But all the little microchips just couldn't handle it. So the developers thought ""I know! Why don't we just take a picture of everything and put it on a cube, and tell the game that it's a reflection!""

And the game developers lived happily ever after. ^(Well some did...)",p3ebrt
hf3kw1g,"graphics in game take computer power to realize. So, if you were to calculate accurate reflections every time, it would take a lot of power.

One of the most common shortcuts developers could use (there are many ways to do this) is to precalculate and create a 2d image of what the reflection should be in *that* place then make the game move that image according to the camera position, so that it looks like there is a real reflection.

Problem is that being that 2d image precalculated, it isn't interactive: e.g. if you move a chair in a place and it should be reflected, that chair isn't going to appear unless you recreate that 2d image. Or, oppositely, if you were remove a chair, that chair is still going to be reflected.

What happened in Free Guys is that developers removed the island and then placed a city instead, forgetting to update the 2d image from specifically the blindfolds of the apartment.",p3ebrt

The comedy falls flat for me, so one of integral aspects of what it tries to do fails in my subjective opinion, therefore I look at the other integral aspects which are relevant which are the action and the plot. As they also fall flat (which I attribute to an uninteresting story structure that is prevalent in Hollywood) the movie was not one that was to my taste.

I personally interpreted her relationship with Guy in a way that she was mostly into him because he's... kind of an adorable goody-two-shoes himbo who is a genuinely sweet guy, and wears Ryan Reynolds's face, who has this uncanny ability to look at his co-star with such naked adoration that it's impossible to not be endeared by it.",p3ebrt

Going by Occam's razor, I think the more likely explanation was that someone, a writer or more likely a producer, was like ""shit, she can't end up with an AI, she has to end up with the boy! Let's write a scene at the end where she ends up with the boy, the nerdy guys in the audience are gonna love that.""

To me, the whole thing feels kinda like pandering.

I think your argument presupposes that Guy is no more than a program, but the movie made it a point to say several times that the AIs in the world behave unexpectedly, the way they want to, because they are more than programs, and they are -for all intents and purposes- their own people. They grow and change on their own, and Guy was used as the very example for a piece of the software becoming something nobody expected him to be. He was written to fall in love with Millie and to be predisposed for liking a certain kind of ice cream or coffee, but he is, at its core, as much a man as a flesh and blood person is, and at the end, he is bound by his programming only in the loosest terms.

There might be a ""nature versus nurture"" argument to make here, because Keys could give Guy a predisposition to like bubblegum ice cream or coffee made a specific way, but with Guy now having free will (after falling in love with Millie and developing past the point his programming should have allowed), Keys no longer controls him, and can't change him anymore- he just gave the building blocks, and Guy now decides what to do with them. (I personally think the relationship between them kind of.... starts at ""creator and creation"", and develops to become more of a weird kind of ""father and son"" relationship, at the lack of a better description.) (Edit: I don't mean emotionally of course, just in the way that they are autonomous people, one of whom is ""genetically"" in the other person.)

While Guy *says* that he's just a love letter in the last scene, almost everything leading up to that line contradicts it. I suspect that could have been a case of the ending being changed midway through development, and this is speculation of course, but I think that Millie and Keys weren't originally supposed to end up together when the script was first written, so they needed to somehow reason away why Millie would suddenly transfer her affections to Keys when, in reality, she had almost no reason to.

Edit 2: Now that I think about it, the very act of him breaking up with Millie was a wholly unexpected action on Guy's part, one that shows that he's much more than the program Keys wrote him to be, which was supposed to be irrevocably in love with her. So by saying it, he proved that it's not the truth, and that he's NOT a love letter (strictly, his base might have been, but the ""HE"" he is now, is not).

I prefer to think that he was just lying because he knew that if they stayed together, Millie would have to essentially live as her own avatar, and would have to sacrifice too much.",p3ebrt
hba11fi,"Ugh, that interview scene. Honestly, why is it that every time a woman in a piece of media says ""no"", the conversation continues with the assumption that she actually meant to say ""yes""? It's so disturbing and sexist. I honestly hate that the movie continues this awful trend. From my perspective as a woman, she seemed uncomfortable with the question altogether, and laughed it off to then continue to consistently treat Keys as one would a friend- it wasn't until the very last moment that she showed any romantic interest in him, so it came all out of the left field. It felt like she's only into the fact that he's into her, and that's just so fucking shallow. 

I guess you can read my replies about this lower down- the long and short of it is that I believe them ending it like this was either piss poor writing uncharacteristic of the team, or an addition late in the development - it's speculation, but I'm guessing probably by the studio. It's ill-fitting, contradicts most everything that was said before about the personhood of AI, and completely crosses out all romantic development with no payoff. It was an ""I guess we have to do this now, too"" ending, the only point of interest being, imo, that Guy breaking up with Millie is, by virtue of it happening, proof that he's lying while doing it.",p3ebrt

hba6pz2,"It's really less about her intention/conscious thought process during the interview, and more about the visual presentation of their chemistry together as characters that says ""oh, they could be cute."" People go from being friends to being couples all the time in real life, and this movie did a good job exploring the nuance of that progression in a mature way.

Millie and Guy breaking up seemed reasonable to me given the reasons described in the movie. Guy gets a chance to actually explore what it means to be a conscious, sapient being without the added stress of dealing with what's essentially an interspecies relationship with...God, basically? It felt like the movie was self-aware in its thematic development, and had cohesive ideas. Also, Guy didn't break up with Millie. She was already contemplating it, and was relieved that he understood her. It was a pretty refreshing, mature take on a breakup scene, imo.",p3ebrt

hbabqhh,"I don't disagree that it was handled maturely in the interaction itself and the breakup happening in the first place, nor do I deny that yes, a lot of times friends become lovers- but I completely disagree with the choice of dialogue, the followup, or that the two characters who ended up together were the ones that did.

This might be biased, but personally, I did not feel any of this chemistry you mention. I didn't think it was cute (I mostly just felt uncomfortable, as I have been in the same position as Millie plenty of times before), and it's mainly the fault of that interview scene, where Millie established a clear boundary by saying no and Keys made it *glaringly obvious* that he did not feel the way she did about the relationship- that made me dread the ending, because I KNEW from that point on that they were going to pull a ""she says no until she says yes""- a common movie trope that I absolutely loathe, and has very troublesome real world implications about disregarding women's voices. It doesn't matter that she said no, that ""no"" turned into a ""yes"" by the end because he persisted- this is a very bad, very common, and almost always completely dismissed trope. (And imo, there was not nearly enough development for their relationship to convince me that her feelings had changed throughout the events of the movie- Keys basically did *the bare minimum* of standing up for himself and his work, *while Millie had been doing that already*, and also fell in love with Guy on the side. Having romantic development in the on-screen relationship just took all time there could have been in the pacing from any possible romantic development elsewhere (and if she's busy panicking about and working towards saving Guy's life, maybe I'm the one who has the emotional capacity of a teaspoon, but I wouldn't have the time or the emotional energy to contemplate my feelings for someone else).

And to clarify, in the breakup scene, the ""who specifically does the dumping"" is kind of irrelevant imo- it was obviously mutual, but the *speech act itself* of breaking up was done by Guy, that's what I meant by wording it the way I did- which brings me to my very point, that I object to the exact line used, Guy referring to himself as a ""love letter"".

By the standards of the universe itself, that is a blatant lie. By using the term, he is referring to himself as no more than the program written by Keys, even when beforehand, it was stated multiple times that 1.) AI, comsummate AI, are equal to humans in all manners but the physical, 2.) that he is aware of what being a person entails and welcomes it, bound by his programming in only the loosest terms (which Keys can't alter, even if he actively tries, which is to say he has no more control over Guy than an average person -capable of killing him physically but not to alter thoughts or feelings or behavior-, *therefore* he's not an author or a god), and 3.) he has developed past being hopelessly in love with Millie (which is how Keys wrote him), and to the point of being able to amicably part ways with her when he realizes that it's better for both of them. By the very act of claiming that he is Keys' program and no more than that (so she should go be with Keys), he is *proving that he is more than that*. 

A preferable outcome, imo, would have been to have no romantic conclusion beyond the breakup (which would have been conclusion enough, I could have been actually very satisfied with that), or for them to further the point of AI being equal to humans by continuing the relationship between Millie and Guy. This... *""don't worry nerd boys, she'll choose you at the end (even if she made no indication of having any sort of non-platonic feelings for you, besides the very act of being the only female main character to exist in the narrative)""* ending is typical Hollywood, and I'm so tired of it. I loved the movie, really, it was great and I haven't laughed this hard on a film in a long time, but it could really have been like... what, five minutes(?) shorter at the end there. Keep the breakup, keep the scene with Buddy because that was adorable, no contrived romance between the human leads please.",p3ebrt

hbdkyqa,"I staunchly agree with the idea of ""no means no,"" and I do agree that popular media needs to do a better idea of disseminating that idea to the masses (especially, but not exclusively, when women are concerned). Playing out the same stale trope that sees the two opposite sex leads together no matter what is pretty disingenuous, regardless of how it's cut.

During my viewing, I was thinking about everything you've mentioned so far while dissecting Keys' and Millie's interactions on screen. While I do believe that there are certain parts of their romance arc that could've been done better, I feel far more comfortable with their development than most other big screen relationships I see. I was happy to see something that was interesting/unique in buildup instead of the same cookie cutter love stories that I've been told a million times, and I actually did appreciate the presence of an AI lover as a device in that story. It was unfortunate that they utilized some archaic tropes in the process.

At the end of the day, it really comes down to me feeling like ""Free Guy"" carries many implications in terms of what we can expect out of cinematic media moving forward. Perhaps I'm more willing to allow the issues you've mentioned to fall to the wayside in my judgment of it because, overall, it left me with some fantastic hopeful energy for the future. It really was a gem, and I think that it'll age extremely well for a romcom.
