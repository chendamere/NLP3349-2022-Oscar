dsm1e82,I got a kick out of the Watergate ending because it felt like I was watching a post-credit scene teasing the next film in the American History Cinematic Universe,7q2oxj
dslzgj5,I Fucking loved that Bob and David had their first scene in the movie together. ,7q2oxj

dsmbl0x,"Great tweet from Tyler Simpson (@braintasm) -

“Went and saw The Post tonight. I watched a film about newspapers inside a movie theater inside of a mall. It was a dying industry turducken.”",7q2oxj
dslxxq0,"Don’t have time to post a thorough detailed analysis, but I absolutely loved the ending! The way they transitioned it to watergate was amazing.",7q2oxj
dsm09lp,"I enjoyed it. It has the hallmarks of Spielberg's late works. Especially the preening Americana of reading the Majority opinion of the SCOTUS to the newsroom aloud and Meryl Streep walking down the SCOTUS steps as a row of women look on. It's the kind of hokey bullshit Spielberg does when he's on auto pilot. It's an exclamation point where a period would have been better. 

The bulk of the movie, following all these people doing the reporting is quite exciting although I wish more time was dedicated to spending time with Daniel Ellsberg and some of the attempts to actually get the Pentagon papers out into the public record like Sen. Mike Gravel actually reading them on the senate floor. It's a tight movie but not expansive in the ways it could have been. 

It's still a good movie. I would recommend it. The performances all around are pretty stellar.  

I will say John Williams action material played over the end credits was quite good. Reminded me of his days working with Oliver Stone on Nixon",7q2oxj
dslzlyw,Overall the film is pretty mid level Spielberg but goddamn can Spielberg block and shoot a scene. So many elegant walk and talks and great visual storytelling.,7q2oxj
dslycvh,I saw both the Commuter and The Post today. I was surprised to see more people at the screening for the Post than for the Commuter. It was mostly a bunch of old people that went to see the Post and surprisingly they were a fun crowd. ,7q2oxj
dsm8wik,"I actually didn't really know anything about this going into it. I knew it was Spielberg, Hanks and Streep. I knew it was about a newspaper fighting to publish. I thought it was going to be more court room drama, we got like 3 minutes in the courts, if that. 

But the cast was stacked. Phenomenally written and acted and I just all around loved it. Might watch it again to share with my family, but for the most part this was a one and done affair for me.

And I have to say I love Spielberg's love of history. I love how he'll do a big budget action flick and then one of these cool period true life period dramas. ",7q2oxj
dslybfw,"The sequence of Streep making her decision was incredible. My audience actually clapped at the end of it.

My complaint is that in the first half the drama really seemed to halt whenever it went to Streep. 2nd half was engaging throughout, but it did drag a bit in the first half.

And not enough Carrie Coon or Michael Stuhlbarg, but obviously excellent performances across the board.",7q2oxj
dso7so5,"I enjoyed the movie, but was surprised to be the only person under 50 in my theater.

The biggest surprise for me was **David Cross**. I'm a huge *Arrested Development* fan and was shocked at how good he was in a dramatic role. ",7q2oxj
dsly243,"If you liked Steve Jobs in the sense that it felt like all the action took form in the place of words, you should love this. I had a great time personally. (Edited Jobs to Steve Jobs. I mixed the two up)",7q2oxj
dspsle4,"This film is ""important"" in the most shallow sense of the word. 

It only scratches the surface of the journalistic process. *All the President's Men* and *Spotlight* completely blow this film out of the water in that respect.

There were so many cringey moments that had me rolling my eyes. 

It's just okay. 6/10",7q2oxj
dslyay3,[deleted],7q2oxj
dslyk49,"As a companion to *Lincoln* and *Bridge of Spies* this is disappointing. It’s a pretty shallow look at the meaning of the fourth estate as opposed to the nuanced depiction of political action in *Lincoln* or his analysis of a country’s morals in *Bridge of Spies.*

As a journalism movie, however, it kind of rocks. Given the way it was advertised I expected a somewhat sluggish period film. Instead I was decently entertained from the beginning and found myself surprised at how brisk it felt by the end. 

I feel like this is getting misidentified as a prestige film because it’s way more of a blockbuster in its verve (hell, Williams score sounds like a damn action film at times). It’s a film about the flow of information, and Spielberg kind of captures that invisible kineticism with his camera and blocking. There’s a lot of overhead shots of papers flying in and out of frame and people moving from location to location. This movie may **feel** relatively rote but the Beard does still have great technical skill and feeling. 

Also I know people hate it but the ending to this is so goofy I kind of love it. ",7q2oxj
dsoqlbp,The scene of Kay walking down the steps after the Supreme Court hearing into a crowd of hippie women had me rolling my eyes. ,7q2oxj
dsly1ol,"It’s almost as if Spielberg rolled out of bed and directed a movie with all his buddies (literally everyone and their mother is in this movie). This is about the most generic Spielberg drama you could possibly get. It’s fine, harmless, somewhat interesting, but ultimately forgettable.",7q2oxj
dszkywb,"Meh.

This movie was meh.

Competent but on autopilot. Hanks and Streep were OK but not at their greatest, a lot of the supporting cast were wasted and the script was alarmingly unsubtle and shouldn't have been nominated for a Globe. The themes were pretty much spelled out on the most annoyingly on the nose way possible (like Sarah Paulson's shoehorned speech and that eye rolling court walk scene).

Oh and that ending was just ridiculously goofy and dragged out what could have been a nice ending.

It's not all bad - the score's great and some scenes of the journalism and printing were genuinely quite enthralling. But this is really just bogstandard Spielberg historical drama and is one of his weakest efforts. Certainly of the big awards contenders that I've seen so far this is comfortably the weakest one.",7q2oxj
dtaxfvs,"I loved this movie, I live in Venezuela and used to work in a local tv station banned by the regime, it touched a nerve in me. I'm disappointed by some of the comments here, I guess you don't know what you have until you lose it. 

The right for free press must not be taken for granted.",7q2oxj
dsp3m9l,I really hated the part where Sarah Paulson spelled out Meryl Streep’s character arc to Tom Hanks.,7q2oxj
dsmfhtq,"It’s exactly what I expected. Nothing surprised me, no one moment really stood out, but that’s okay sometimes. Sometimes a really solid, competent, well-acted film with a timely message is enough. 8/10 from me",7q2oxj
dsowvnw,All I could think of during the ending scene was [this.](https://youtu.be/bmnSMlAstMc?t=36s),7q2oxj
dsn06tl,"I really enjoyed this film, I personally had no issues with the slow pace.

Bob Odenkirk and Tom Hanks had really interesting roles, I think they both did an outstanding job.

Also I loved the scenes detailing The Post’s printing press in action, it was positively hypnotizing. 

Particularly the machine that pulls the papers up on a vertical conveyor belt, that contraption is just fascinating to watch.",7q2oxj
dsow07p,"This movie was ultimately super disappointing. I think they focused on the wrong character.  Kay's transformation wasn't interesting enough to back the whole movie.  Her 'arch' actually took away from the more interesting parts of the story.  

I think the allstar cast actually also killed this movie.  I will never by Meryl Streep as an underdog.  Also it seems like they remembered that they hired Allison Brie and Sarah Paulson and decided to give both random monologues. 

Also, if they didn't want to be compared to All the President's Men, they shouldn't have ended the movie at watergate.  Let the characters have their victory and move on.  Opening with Watergate reminds a lot of movie fans of the beginning of All the President's Men, in which it pales in comparison. ",7q2oxj
dswfb2q,"So, who's agenda is being served by making 'The Post' look like the hero in all this rather than the Times? Legit question... I can't quite figure it out by looking up who owns both these papers (as it just gives me LLCs).",7q2oxj
dsm2gk7,This movie is like Rogue One to All The President’s Star Wars. Very awesome.,7q2oxj
dsw1pxx,"I think it's a well-shot, well-acted, and fairly well-paced movie, that is interesting but overall somewhat forgettable and kinda heavy-handed in certain regards. The female empowerment bits were ok, but they didn't seem like a focus of the movie, and we're just kind of tacked on and final scene of her walking out of the courthouse through the dozens of women was a little forced. The focus seemed much more on the separation of the press and the politicians, but then that started to feel a bit overdone by the end. Overall, I think it was a good movie with an obvious message for today's political climate.",7q2oxj
dszv5ox,"Someone get Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks an ice pack, because their hands are sore after patting each other on the back so much.",7q2oxj
dsnhvc5,"Meth Damon and Gabe were cast perfectly in this movie.

dspd3e7,"I'm loving the Nixon era extended universe! The Post, Forrest Gump, All the President's Men, and Frost Nixon.",7q2oxj
dt49eps,"I didn't care for this movie and it honestly should have been a slam dunk for someone like me. I like all the actors, I'm a Spielberg fan, and I like the subject matter. I am having a difficult time remembering a movie that was edited worse than this one that was supposed to be high-caliber. There were countless times that i thought ""why are we watching this scene?"" ""Why did he pick THAT camera angle? It seems weird for this scene."" ""I need to look away because the text is moving by the screen so quickly it's making me nauseous trying to read it."" (Why show us newspaper headlines if you don't give us any time to read them?) There were also several ""emotional"" scenes that felt tacked-on and unearned. I was totally unmoved by Streep and Alison Brie's conversation in the bedroom about the husband's suicide; and then unmoved again at the climax where Carrie Coon announces the SCOTUS decision. Coon's character is barely touched on and hardly has any dialogue. Plus, given the message of the movie (that women were often excluded and looked down on in the workplace), it struck me as bizarre that the male characters who are more senior than her would have allowed her to read it or that anyone would have contacted her first. I thought during this scene, ""I am supposed to be moved by this. This is where Spielberg wants me to cry."" Also, I actually laughed out loud in the closing scene where it turns out to be...WATERGATE!!! That reminded me of a superhero franchise movie, where the closing scene is actually a ""cliffhanger"" to get you interested in the upcoming sequel (The Post 2: Watergate Boogaloo), which was tonally bizarre for a straight Prestige Drama.

In short, I felt like i saw the first draft of this movie and would have liked to have seen what they would have come up with had they spent more time editing it.

Another critique: I feel like I am (early 30s) at the younger end of people who know this story and the people involved well enough to understand who most of the people were. However, I think Spielberg makes a LOT of assumptions that the audience already knows who all the people are that will be alienating to younger people. For example, he doesn't name Robert McNamara until several scenes in, assuming you must know that the Secretary of State at the time was him. Older people will have no problem, but even though I'm familiar enough with the story, I had to think to myself, ""Hmm. I THINK that's Bob McNamara, but I'll wait and see."" Spielberg is casting himself well as the Director Who Makes Movies Your Dad Likes But You Think Are Just OK. Generational directorial assumptions like this one further solidify that reputation.

The biggest asset of this movie was Meryl Streep (surprise, surprise). Even with lousy editing, the audience still knew exactly what Kay's motivations were, why she made the choices she did, and what her conflicts were. That's actually really remarkable in a movie as poorly edited as this one.",7q2oxj
dsm280g,"Honestly, I'm a little underwhelmed. The actual history behind this is a story well worth telling (and has a certain resonance today), but as a film this was surprisingly on the dull side, particularly for the first third or so. I was hoping Ellsberg would be a major player, he's the one that leaked the damned papers in the first place, but nope. Kay, while I appreciate what her arc was in the grand scheme of things, wasn't that compelling of a character in her own right. I get that with films based on a true story there's a balance that has to be made between creating interesting characters and staying true to how they were in real life, but I feel like there are based-on-a-true-story films that handle that much better. Also, I really couldn't help but only see Hanks and Streep as Hanks and Streep.

This film was okay. I certainly wouldn't say it was *badly* done, but I feel that there is a better film that could be made out of this crazy, tumultuous time in American history. Go watch the recent Ken Burns documentary on the Vietnam War. I know that was a documentary and had the advantage of being a multi-episode TV series, but *that* was really well done and made me feel like I was living through that time in a way that this film just didn't quite do.",7q2oxj
dsnre3k,Did anyone realise The Post was a mini reunion of many many Fargo characters? LOVE IT! ,7q2oxj
dsmmt7k,"Went and saw this Thursday night with a rapturous crowd. This audience clapped a half-dozen times throughout as if this was opening night of Star Wars. I enjoyed the reception, but upon a revisit in a few years (probably after this administration), I’m not sure it’ll hold up.",7q2oxj
dsm0mhq,Let’s just say this movie convinced me to finally stop my incognito shenanigans: I subscribed to the Washington Post as soon as I got home. ,7q2oxj
dsminja,"The best scene here was by far Meth Damon trying to talk to Bob Odenkirk about his source.  Bob has developed a way of mastering somber expressions for closeups, and it’s no exception here.  Otherwise I dont think the film was as visually compelling as people seem to think, and the lead performances from Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep were pretty cookie-cutter bad and overshadowed by the phenomenal supporting cast.  Overall this was a very well directed, well written film that I would be completely happy watching again, though it eschews any artistic statements in favor of political ones.",7q2oxj
dsv8g6b,"I was disappointed. It felt like Spielberg was just making tropes to get award noms. Loved seeing Bob Odenkirk and David Cross back together, but that's about it.",7q2oxj
dsn5usn,"Better than it should have been given how on the nose some of the script is.

The camera kept zooming in on faces right before they were about to give a big speech. That was a good trick but it must have happened at least 5 times.",7q2oxj
dsotlj8,"I saw this yesterday with some friends. It was good, def worth checking out, but basically inoffensive. The appeal of the film is watching Streep and Hanks. The material itself is so dry, trying to build an entire movie around it (Will she or won't she approve the paper to leak the papers)... it's not that compelling enough... ",7q2oxj
dtnv87o,Absolutely loved it. Every performance was great.,7q2oxj
dsm8wgh,"Lol, judging by the comments here I'm thinking the old ""Lady Bird wasn't well directed because NO SFX!"" rubbish has happened again with this movie.",7q2oxj
dt2ce6g,"The scene with the secretary tearing up after delivering the speech from the guy on the phone was the cheesiest and corniest shit I've seen in years.

Also, I really hate how Spielberg chooses to have like 50 scenes end after someone says ""we need to look at this"" ""there's a problem"" ""look in the box then cut to next scene"". It feels like a very outdated directing technique. ",7q2oxj
dssu2b8,The Post is the Rogue One of All the President's Men. ,7q2oxj
dspc900,Had to look up Liz Hannah.  This is her first screenplay.  It’s her spec script that got picked up by Spielberg.   That’s amazing.  ,7q2oxj
dt79cks,"Just saw it, was predictably underwhelmed.  I wish Spielberg would take his time rather than cranking out movie after movie, this one just felt completely thrown together, with the best of the best to make up for the fact: Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, famous side characters (Bob Odenkirk and David Cross...why?).

Mainly though, I thought it was fascinating how this was essentially the same movie as *Spotlight* - same plot, same conflict: corrupt super power is covering up a scandal, intrepid journalists uncover the story and fight for it to go to press.  Only everything works in *Spotlight*, only some of the stuff works in *The Post* - which sucks, given that the topic is still pretty interesting in and of itself.  

There's also more twists and turns in *Spotlight*, we watch them uncover the story bit by bit - in *The Post* the story is set from the opening 30 minutes, all there is to do is to decide whether to publish or not...so we get scene after scene of handwringing and people talking about the pros and cons of going to print...which is frustrating, because it's slow, you know they're going to, and then the consequences barely seem to happen.  What should be the third act (the government's response) is condensed into a footnote.

I don't know, this movie felt like wasted potential.",7q2oxj
dslzeya,When Kay said “I can never live through something like this again” half the audience in my theater went “oooof” ,7q2oxj
dsmhwgz,"Two great films about the Post, as someone who grew up and still lives in the DMV and grew up on the Post it’s nice to see.  While it wasn’t as good as All the President’s Men, but it was still a quality film.  It’s sad that the media is so consolidated now that you no longer get the feeling that they are fighting for the governed over their corporate interests.  Hopefully the press can become independent and prominent again.  I know given our current climate it’s hard to fight the good fight, when the Government and half the nation attack it constantly.",7q2oxj
dsxnmb8,"It's amazing how relevant this these days.  It's just amazing...

A great film, Spielberg at his finest.  A really good story teller.  

Huge fan of this film.  I'm going to see it again tomorrow night.",7q2oxj
dtgjk3q,Wow seeing far negative reactions than I expected for this. I thought the movie was fantastic and the performances were strong (as expected) and carry the film throughout without making it boring.,7q2oxj
du9smih,[deleted],7q2oxj
dspdmb2,"Average at best.

Maybe I missed something, but the movie was filled with manufactured tension, varying characters with slightly above averages at best, and a sagging plot that fizzled to an inevitable conclusion.",7q2oxj
dslyb3a,"I felt like this movie was okay. For a movie that was directed by Spielberg, and had pretty superb acting from Streep (and Hanks), it still felt a little lackluster. Like a more generic Spotlight I guess. Still a solid 3.5 to 4, just didn't meet my expectations. ",7q2oxj
dsnpoew,Kinda disappointed that Bob and David didn't interact.,7q2oxj
dsqfg3l,I thought this was really good. It was interesting to see the parallels between Nixon and Trump in regards to their views of the media. ,7q2oxj
dt35r2o,"Definitely a little “heavy handed” at times, but overall an enjoyable film. ",7q2oxj
dt3qnxq,"I feel like the movie would have been better if the ended just after the 6-3 verdict was announced, but before the quote was relayed over the phone.  As it is, I felt like it was good for the first 75% then turned the ham up for the last quarter just in case someone in the theater didn't get the message.",7q2oxj
dxf67zv,"huge Spielberg fan, and i'm a huge sucker for these types of movies, but this was a by-the-numbers snoozer.  seemed like he did it just to check a box.  Spotlight did it way better.  Streep was the only light in the blandness, for me.  everyone else just looked like they were trying too hard to keep up with her.

no one will remember this film a year from now, and i suspect most people have already forgotten most of it.  heck i watched it a few hours ago and it's already a fuzzy blur.  no shining moments to latch onto.  shame.",7q2oxj
dsm0y0l,"Just got back from the theater. I wasn't particularly excited for this movie, but it definitely exceeded my expectations. It was so well shot, and I loved Tom Hanks' and Bob Odenkirk's characters.

The story was also very engaging for me. One of the rare movies where I didn't even think about checking my watch. 

I also really enjoyed the last 20 minutes; especially when [Bradlee slaps all the other papers onto Graham's desk](#spoiler), that was a really great moment. 

It wasn't Spielberg's most memorable work, but I enjoyed the film, and I'm glad I saw it.

P.S. Really glad Carrie Coon got such a significant role. I've loved her since The Leftovers. ",7q2oxj
dspw4jl,Meth Damon ?!,7q2oxj
dswvuql,"I went into this without having seen any advertisements- just knew it was a new Spielberg/Tom Hanks film.

When the opening scene was a war scene in vietnam- I got really excited thinking it was gonna be another Saving Private Ryan.

I realized very soon after my hopes were ignorant at best, but I really enjoyed the film. Creating tension/suspense through talking only is very difficult to do, and I think they nailed it. Not a perfect film- some parts dragged or felt unnecessary, but overall it was a very well made film.",7q2oxj
dtcn3j2,"The last scene made me more excited than the majority of the actual film (though I actually did enjoy it, despite its pace). 

Maybe too many Marvel films has warped my mind, but was Spielberg setting up the sequel in the last few minutes?",7q2oxj
dtg7in8,"I just came from seeing this and I just wanted to say how mad I am about the Nixon miming nonsense. I don't think the actor playing him was listening to the tapes when they filmed, they just told him to wag his finger around and bang his fist on the table once or twice completely out of time with what's actually being said. Drove me nuts.",7q2oxj
dthwffo,"The second half was definitely more engaging than the first - it's kind of a shame that they breezed through that portion so quickly and that it took so long for the movie for them to get The Papers. Overall, it was fine - definitely not a bad movie, but not a great one either and not something that almost anyone would want to watch multiple times.

The way it ended to tie into Watergate was kind of an odd choice - felt more like an ending that someone would do if they were planning on hyping people up for a sequel, except that All The President's Men already exists - and that movie, along with a number of other journalism-related movies are vastly better than this. You could definitely tell that it was rushed into production, but it kind of speaks to the talent involved that they were still able to put forth something as well made as it was.

Definitely going to be one of those movies that is going to be played (and bore) countless numbers of American high schools in the many years to come.",7q2oxj
dslxxaq,"As far as Best Picture contenders go, I was really disappointed in both **The Shape Of Water** & **The Post**. At least **The Shape Of Water** felt fresh & original. On the other hand, I didn't get that from **The Post**.

Everything felt just 'okay'. Run-of-the-mill drama, low-tier Spielberg, with a bloated cast. The 'turning around and facing the camera while crying/delivering a monologue' parts felt incredibly fake & theater-y. Almost laughable sometimes. Really took me out of it, especially the over-acted scene between Streep & Brie. The opening Vietnam War scene looked cheesy and amateur. It's what I imagine a Vietnam War scene in a sitcom would look like.

I really didn't like Streep's character arc. How did she change that much within the span of 48 hours? Wasn't believable, on top of her character not being like-able for the majority of the film.

At least 3 times, I had the thought ""damn, I'd really rather be watching **All The President's Men** or **Spotlight** right now"". Just bland, uninspired. Such a dropoff from **Bridge Of Spies** for Spielberg.

I was really hyped for the cast but most of them are just throwaway characters with minimal screentime. The only decent supporting performances are from Bruce Greenwood & Bob Odendirk. Michael Stuhlbarg is criminally underused and David Cross seems so out of place.

6/10, okay I guess. Not Top 40 for me this year. The only true highlights for me are Tom Hanks/Tracy Letts and the shoe-in Watergate scene at the end. It was an easy/obvious scene to add, but I fucking loved it.

dsylsut,"Thoroughly enjoyed it, but no, it's not perfect. It was a pretty by-the-numbers screenplay, but I think Spielberg did his best with what he was given. And there were actually a lot of pretty riveting scenes powered by dialogue. Yes, there are some scenes with the classic Spielberg heavy handedness, but that's kind of to be expected of him. But I can understand how that's off putting to some. From a technical standpoint though, the movie was top notch. I always love watching scenes unflod, and realizing that minutes have gone by without an edit and I've just been watching two actors do amazing work. Spielberg is truly a master behind the camera. Don't really understand a lot of the hate the movie is getting. Overall it's a pretty middle of the road movie for Spielberg, but that in no way means that it's a bad movie, it's just not OMG amazing. I actually don't think he has made a really great film since Munich. But anyway, the audience I saw it with seemed to be pretty enthralled and applauded at the end. I think the real goal of this movie was to get people thinking and talking, and it certainly had that effect on the audience I witnessed.",7q2oxj

Loved the shots of the newspaper getting printed and how they created the typeset for the letterpress, etc. 

Most of the people in my theater cheered when Kay said, ""I'm talking to Ben"" after Arthur interrupted and disrespected her for the umpteenth time in the movie. For me, it was one of the most powerful moments of a great, feminist movie. ",7q2oxj

This was an okay Spielberg film. I’d rank it towards the middle of his filmography. I’m a pretty big history buff and was pretty excited to see this, but left kinda disappointed.

The ending scene with Watergate that basically leads into All The Presidents Men was great though.

dt9dczn,"I have read several comments about how the ending was odd, or felt a bit too on the nose or heavy handed. On the flip side, I really liked the ending. I was thinking how well timed it was (obviously intentionally) with whats going on, and how history is doomed to repeat itself if we aren't careful and learning from it. It went from one scandal to the next - kind of like: we got through this, it took all this courage, and then BAM, we got hit with another. Only luckily (for us as viewers) we have hindsight, and know how that ended. I am not at all political - but it definitely had me considering the current state of politics, the agenda of he who sits in the white house, and how the phone conversations of Nixon (where one man truly thought he was the state, and not serving the state) are just too similar for comfort from the banning of certain media outlets from press-breifings.

It was relying really hard on Hanks and Streep, yet Streep's character was so basic that I never was blown away.

Weird movie, I would tell people its decent but to not expect anything great. The movie kinda just...happens.  ",7q2oxj

The last 45 minutes or so were great, but it really dragged until then. And I'm someone who likes a slow burn of a drama... but to me I never felt like anyone had stakes. I know she did because it was her family paper but I didn't feel like there was a larger backstory of why she cared about the paper other than owning it, why she cared about the truth, etc. We know her [son went to war](#spoiler) but it barely registered as a one line throwaway.

I don't know. I also felt like, especially for a Spielberg film, it was painful how poorly done the sets were. You could tell so clearly they were on a studio lot in the streets of New York. The protest scene was so fake it hurt. I don't know, the sanitized nature of everything took my out of the viewing.

Every choice they make, every little thing that happens, can prevent the people from getting justice.  There were times when I saw someone walk in a parking lot, and I was legit scared they would assassinated. The fear ran through the whole movie, and you really felt that it was a small paper fighting an empire.

dt9z6xo,"All in all a good movie, won't be watching it again. Not what I expect from Spielberg, the dude can direct brilliantly in his sleep, and that's what he did on this movie. 

Hanks was miscast. There's an constant disadvantage while casting that role, everyone will have Jason Robards in their head, that character is fucking iconic. Not even for a single second did I buy that role. He was too ""nice"" for that role. I didn't see a newspaper editor in Hanks, I didn't see his leadership skills. I could see people getting scared of Robards in All The Presidents Men, I could see him motivating people. I think even Hanks phoned it in. Maybe a Liev Schreiber or Crowe or even DDL (if he could've gotten him). 

Taking the point of view from Streep's character was a mistake. I thought the most interesting thing in the movie was the friendly rivalry between Hanks and Stuhlbarg. Also Mathew Rhys character was more interesting. Should've stuck with him more. Streep's character was boring. She should've been supporting at best. Instead of revolving the story around Streep and Hanks, should've been an ensemble story like Spotlight with few people getting their character arc's. 

Also I got out of the movie at two places. When Hanks get's a call from Assistant Attorney General and Streep and Letts were there in the scene. It was a oner, but when the Hanks hangs up the call, the camera is on the phone, then it cuts to close up on Hanks, Streep and Letts (great blocking), it was obvious they used a different take, I think originally, the camera was supposed to pan up to that close up. Second was when Stuhlbarg receives the envelope, it was an obvious cut from a oner.

How great was Lett's? 2 Best picture nominations in a single year. Polar opposite of his role on Lady Bird.

The scene where Hanks shows Streep the other papers was brilliant. Even the scene where Coon's character reads out a justice's decision, what a brilliant scene. Would have killed it 20 years ago. But now things have changed, we need more subtly. 

The way they recreated the offices of The Post was brilliant... Felt like it popped out of All The President's Men. Very nicely recreated. ",7q2oxj

And to break free from that takes an incredible amount of strength - something that many men aren’t able to understand.

After hearing this score it kinda makes me bummed that he didn't get to do Bridge of Spies. I loved Bridge of Spies, but the one thing that felt off to me about that movie was the score. When I hear Newman's music I don't feel like I'm watching a Spielberg movie because I feel like his music is not as organic as JW's.

Oh, boo-hoo, you were born into a life of opulence and now you have to make a decision to maintain your lifestyle. 

Cheesy and sanctimonious. This is what *The Post* is. The scene where Kay is literally glowing walking down the steps of the Supreme Court lined with adoring smiling women with their heads following her is literally the most eye-roll inducing shot I have seen in my life. 

And then the ending. Kay says something along the lines of ""I don't think I can do *this* again"" **clapping like a seal** huh huh bravo stephen I get the reference it's so clever!! ehuh ehuh hyuck bravo!

3/10. Preachy, cheesy, and absolutely zero subtlety in its story-telling. Government BAD! Press and media GOOD!

Now I will say I have seen a lot of comments with valid complaints about the film and if they didn't like it I could understand. This isn't aimed towards them because everyone is entitled to their own opinion and film can be a matter of taste.

In terms of pure directorial ability, no one has yet to top Spielberg.

Hanks and Odenkirk are the MVP's with Hanks balancing gruff and likability with ease. Meryl Streep is very good but can become Oscar bait-y at times.

Spielberg and Kaminski's camerawork is the highlight. There's not a better director when it comes to working with the camera than Spielberg.

dsm6ckw,"The first act was mindnumbingly boring, totally unengrossing. But it grew exponentially more interesting until I actually found myself super engaged throughout.

Characters were sort of bland and just sideswept if they were not Meryl Streep or Tom Hanks, those two while adequate didn't really bring anything new to the table. This film is more about a historical narrative and triumph of an ideology than it is about human beings and the sparse sequences of humanity feel a little contrived.

Movie was too predictable, perhaps inevitably - the entire theme is of freedom of the press which is a totally one sided thing (yes, it's good) - you hence know exactly how shit goes down. And it doesn't really go down, there's no significant escalation because the film's suspense is entirely verbal. It's not visceral. The biggest tension comes from watching internal struggle and predictability sort of puts that struggle on a leash. 

That said, it's not really as tense as it is exciting to watch things speed along which is what sold me. The eventual pace of the film is engaging unlike its initial trappings. 

Ultimately, 7/10, a safe Spielberg film. Will deliver some goods but it's not at all noteworthy and it won't compel you to come back for a second watch, it's likeable enough as it stands to be a worthy flick that won't challenge you, but comfortably confirm and reassure what you already know.

It told the story of this event that I didn't know all that well in a compelling way. It won't be remembered even 2 years from now but for an hour of my time, I'd say it was worth it. It's strength is definitely it's ensemble. Again, another film that has me convince we need an ensemble cast Oscar.

Side note: this will be one of the few years Meryl Streep gets an out-of-respect Oscar nom and I won't totally disagree with it.

I dunno... I didn't hate it but I didn't love it. I feel like most of the press and hype around is just due to Trumps whole ""fake news"" thing and news outlets standing up to him. The movie seemed like a clear commentary on that, especially with the ladies dramatic phone recitation of the supreme court decision.",7q2oxj
dt7nrmc,"Saw it last night and still thinking about it, so I gave it an 8. I thought the selection of background stories portrayed, combined with the overall historical view, and the atmospherics all combined with the triple black diamond expert- level acting worked really well to show this historical event.  

I read the Katherine Graham autobiography a while ago. What a life. She really was an historical figure, and rose to the occasion despite being a product of the times. She came from a privileged white southern background, and was thrown into the world of 1960's men to be their boss after her husband, who everyone loved, committed suicide. So I don't quibble with this being her story. She deserves it. 

The other aspect was that Washington was a small town. So the press wouldn't report on the politicians unfavorably. They were at dinner parties and knew each other's children. So reporting on MacNamara was another conflict. (No one liked Nixon it seems.) But, she was an outsider as a woman, and perhaps that's why she made the decision to publish. 

The movie portrays her as a female whistleblower, at great personal risk. The movie portrays Ben Bradley as trying to get personal glory by being the cowboy who isn't going to be pushed around by the Nixon whitehouse, and would gladly let her go to jail.

All this is framed in the newspaper era, with printing presses and delivery of bundles, and Royal typewriters, smokey offices and Xerox machines and steel file cabinets and pay phones. Time deadlines. And struggling financials. Arguments over morals versus sales. 

The acting was terrific, of course, with the big names. The acting for the young lawyers and interns should also be called out, as these were memorable roles, kind of the canaries in the coal mines. 

The movie pulls you into this world, from a high vantage point, and show how the right decisions are not easy. Timely lesson.",7q2oxj

dsm6yl5,"I was excited for this. Big names with lots of great past projects so my expectations were high. And I also love seeing stories about the behind the scenes operations of how a news story develops and is reported on. 

But I was disappointed. I thought it was weak. It unnecessarily romanticized the industry (if you read the news you already know its immense value to society). In comparison, All the Presidents Men does a much better job of demonstrating how important journalism is without needing to lean on cheesy or over the top shots like the kid holding up his Times ID like it's an FBI badge, or literally everyone in the Post newsroom holding up a copy of the Times after the story broke. (And it's very unlikely an entire room of people would hold the paper up like that to read it. At least one person is gonna fold it back and then in half, especially if it's a long article. But we needed to see the Times logo to force the point so everyone had to hold it up.)

Also so many scenes looked like you can see the movement start. Film/television is supposed to give the effect of us being a silent observer of life in motion. But throughout the movie when it cut to a new scene you could tell everyone was standing on their X,  waiting for the director to give the call and then they started the movements and dialogue. It felt unnatural/stiff in too many scenes. The early dinner scene right before McNamara alerted Kay to the Times report is an example: a few lighthearted remarks --> man says his line about politics --> everyone stands --> women go to the next room laughing/casual banter, say their few lines --> cut to men taking a seat together quickly rattling off a few lines about politics. It was a blatant juxtaposing of the men and women to tell us Kay was out of place in society running a newspaper. 

And there were quite a few cheesy shots for a director of Spielberg's caliber. A major one was toward the end where the camera is pointing to a paper on a coffee table, Hanks' character says something about the Post no longer being a small market local paper and then the camera pans up at them so the angle makes them look like giants. That's such a cheap camera trick to make a point. 

5/10. Between the writing and directing, an opportunity was missed. I think the reason for making the film distracted everyone from focusing on making a quality film.

Well, about the actors and roles: 

* Meryl Streep was quite underwhelming. 

* Tom Hanks played a roarier and bossier version of Chesley Sullenberger. 

* The converastions in general felt like they were specifically orchestrated to feel hectic or something, when they talked over one another.

dslyxdt,"This is one of Meryl Streep's best performances in a while, but on the whole, The Post is just alright. Meryl Streep has a great performance and her arc, going from a well-connected socialite who stumbled into owning the paper and lacks confidence in the face of a male-dominated social order to someone willing to put everything on the line for the sake of the integrity of the Post and the press in general, is strong. Heck, I also really liked most of the rest of the cast, especially Bob Odenkirk. The problem is the script in most other respects is pretty weak: the first hour absolutely crawls, the dialogue is mediocre and outside of Streep's Kay Graham, none of the characters are particularly interesting. Hank's is probably the most disappointing performance, as he basically just scrunches his face and has a gravely voice as ""generic gruff newspaperman"" and doesn't have a patch on Jason Robard's performance of Ben Bradlee in All the President's Men. Finally, for all the star power not in front of the camera, this is the least inspired work from Janusz Kaminski or John Williams that I can remember. 

Meryl Streep's performance and character are enough to make up for a lot of the shortcomings, but The Post can't get past an extremely clunky start and a flawed script. In ranking Spielberg's informal series of ""American ideals tested"" movies, it's definitely behind Lincoln and about the same level as Bridge of Spies and Amistad.",7q2oxj

- Hanks was also good. I realized how much I missed watching him after seeing this

- Spielberg's directing was great. I see a lot of comments about how it had no visual appeal. Are people crazy? I mean firstly, its a movie about a newspaper releasing a story, your not going to get landscapes and CG and stuff that people would call beautiful.

All members of the supporting cast play their parts well and there are really no weak points or even awkward moments.

In terms of writing, the plot was engaging and easy to follow. Clearly though, it was of secondary concern to the themes of the movie.

If you felt that messages of freedom of the press and female empowerment were over the top, you are probably exactly the kind of person this movie was made for. This movie critiques the society of the time as well as our own. It provides insight into a larger world of corruption, class stratification, and government deception while shining a bright light on misogyny in the work place and attempts to silence the press by the government.

I was getting into it during the second act when the actual papers part of the story came into play and the journalists doing their job came into play, but they stretched the good parts way too thin over the entire runtime and filled it in with dramatized historical fiction tropes. 

The movie ended up becoming so cheesy in the end, where everybody not on Bradlee's side was a cookie-cutter bad guy. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge proponent of journalism (having been one myself professionally), but I hate the pat-on-the-back style movies where it's set up so smugly. Hindsight is 20/20, and the legal threats were very serious. Journalism is never cut and dry, and there's always doubts about doing the right thing, which I don't think they handled as well as movies like All the President's Men and Spotlight did. It's why the Newsroom grated on me so much.

Not to mention, they through in way too many cheesy moments, especially at the end, to the point where they were treating the viewer as dumb. ""Oh hey, just in case you can't tell you're the protagonist, we're going to have an aide for the opposite side of the court case come tell you she believes in you and you made the right decision."" ""Oh hey, in case you didn't realize the significance of a woman in power making a decision and getting a major victory against men, let's throw in a bunch of women clapping close up after the fact.""

Yeah I positively hated this movie.

I despise Streep's character with a vengeance. She's unlikable and largely comes across as incompetent, and the scenes of trying to paint her as some* sort of paragon of feminism are hysterical.

I don't give a shit about this (even at the time) 7 digit value company. Seriously, your family newspaper with hundreds of employees and that makes you the hero to root for? All done in that fake Streep humility to boot? 

Fuck. That.

I mildly enjoyed Tom Hanks, but even then he was pretty much always Tom Hanks playing the part, which is probably half Hanks and half writing. Which, in this movie, was a complete groaner. 

Everything felt so calculated in the worst way possible. Those ""sweeping"" orchestra tunes coming in, those usual shout for your Oscar speeches, that goddamn dramatic close up of the court reading at the end? Are you kidding? I'm a pretty petty person, I admit, but it's like this movie was designed to irritate me. I levied the same criticism against Darkest Hour, but it feels somewhat like a pretense of a movie for awards and milquetoast political self-satisfaction. 

For me personally, this was my least favorite movie of 2017. Giving awards to this movie is a goddamn embarrassment. It's a lazy, mediocre if not poorly made, limp slap on current political affairs for people to pat themselves on the back about. Take that, conservatives!

When everything becomes more intense so does the movie and it gets better. Again though overall this is boring. 

Positives include the acting (Of course). Meryl and Tom were once again great but i mean were we expecting anything else. I could tell that some of the scenes were improvised by them two but it wasn't obvious they just worked really well with each other.

Negatives: Lazy, slow and it feels like Steven saw Spotlight 2 years ago and went 'Hey, I think i can do better' so he rounded up his best actors and took a well known story and played it out and in theory it should have worked, In theory this film SHOULD
 be winning the oscars, not because of the oscar bait but because of the team behind the camera, but theories arent always correct and i would actually be mad if this got nominated, but it probably will so not much i can do

Most of the acting was just good, though a few characters including Bob Odenkirk's just felt a bit out of place. I appreciate the feminist and political messages that the film is trying to get across, though in some scenes especially near the end it just got so heavy handed that it was basically the actors and screen writers winking at the camera and it really took me out of it.

This is the type of Oscar Bait garbage that critics of Hollywood are talking about. Gender Studies wins again. I may be a tad harsh, but this is just garbage. Do they think we're this dumb? To be forcefed like this?  Here is my quick review. Skip it. Read on for a spoiler free review...

I forgot that Spielberg had directed! I was SHOCKED because during the movie I kept thinking how uninspired the directing choices seemed. How ""mechanical"" everything seemed staged. The lighting heavy handed. Such as the Supreme Court steps scene, or ANY of the ""protest"" scenes. The Oscar bait of the boardroom meeting, the poor choices of following the boring storyline because it involves the woman being the smartest person in the room filled with men. The female assistant being ""inspired"" despite her boss. Tom Hanks was trying hard, Streep got too much screen time and her wardrobe sabotaged her character. Was she wearing a curtain as a dress the entire 2nd half of the movie?? Her scene with Allison Brea at the end was just word salad. Meh. Sarah Paulson is wasted here. The first half is a sleeper of a history drag. The music lets us down in keeping the overwhelmingly Baby boomer audience awake. We've somehow seen all of this before, could it be Spotlight?!?!? But done so so much better. Yes, there are thinly veiled reminders of Trumps anti-media biases. That lesson is made clear, several times. But ultimately this movie fails because it chose the wrong characters to focus on. The real intrigue and action should have been with the military analysts who committed espionage with his theft of the pentagon papers, or Bob Odenkirk's character getting back into the old feeling of being part of a ""small rebellion"" again with his reporting.  But no. We are forced to learn again, that women are just as good as men even though they are forced by men to focus on dinner parties, style sections, and making sandwiches. Gender Studies Hollywood is teaching us again. Lastly, think back to that absolutely HORRIBLE opening scene in Vietnam. Is this really the same director who gave us Saving Private Ryan? That was the most cliched Vietnam footage I've ever seen. Including the musical choice of CCR.  

Bottom Line, skip this movie and watch Spotlight again. ",7q2oxj

I immensely enjoyed the movie ""Spotlight"", and I can't imagine fans of that would be disappointed in this one. The storytelling also reminds me of courtroom dramas like ""The Lincoln Lawyer"", ""A Time to Kill"" and ""The Pelican Brief"". Okay, yes, there are a number of Grisham adaptations here, but when it comes to procedurals you want to be immersed in the details. Even something like FX's fantastic ""The People vs. OJ Simpson"" doesn't feel like it earns its payoff unless you've vested yourself in all the details. And when the details have factual basis, it makes it all the more gripping.

An interesting accompanying piece to this film is HBO's documentary ""The Newspaperman: The Life and Times of Ben Bradlee"".

That being said, The Post is also a good movie. The first half of movie was slow and mostly redundant, unraveling very little of the plot, but the 2nd half really took speed and did what it set out to do.

The cinematography was overdone and overly dramatized for no reason. It was such intense build-up to see Meryl Streep say two words or Tom Hanks reveal an arm full of newspapers. The acting was fine, but it seemed like everyone was phoning this in, Spielberg especially. He apparently directed this and Ready Player One at the same time, and that doesn't surprise me. This feels very much like a piece of art that didn't have the full attention of the person making it, and I'm worried that Ready Player One will have the same feel, and that we'll get two half-assed movies instead of one full-assed one.

dsmi3jb,"Didn't like it at all. I'm as left as they come and this was Virtue Signalling: The Movie. They shot this movie a few months ago and you can really tell. I think the most egrigious example is during the first scene between Streep and Hanks's character (the breakfast one). Go watch that scene again. You'll realize most of that conversation is a 5 minute long take with the camera simply lazily swiveling from side to side. In fact, when they actually did cut to Streep I was shocked because to me, it suggested they literally did the master shot, then the A and B of Hanks and Streep, but the fact that they used the master for most of that scene (which, let's be honest, was not a meeting of the minds) suggests to me the other shots weren't good. This did not need to be a L O N G T A K E .

Some of the dialogue was atrocious, particularly Tracy Letts's ""Never in the history of the republic"" line. Like what the fuck? Who signed off on that? It was so cheesy you could have clogged your arteries with it. To add insult to injury, you made Tracy Letts, one of the greatest living American playwrights (probably the greatest IMO) say it out loud? As a bonus, Carrie Coon (his irl wife) got that stupid scene in the end when she's reading out the Supreme Court decision by the phone. Yes I know this is a movie, but literally no one would have stuck around for the justification of the decision. Just baffling choices in that department.

Hated the Vietnam prologue. That's really there to insult the viewer's intelligence because if you take it out LITERALLY NOTHING CHANGES. We should have met Ellsburg in the hotel room; there's enough background on him until that scene that would have organically replaced the VIETNAM BAD. LEAKING GOOD opening scene that dragged on forever.

I can't even make a joke about how this was a terrible Mr. Show sketch because this really wasn't a good movie at all. A lot of people are shocked it blanked at the BAFTAs? I'm not.

Hanks as Bradlee? Embarrassing compared to Jason Robards. That's the movie you should watch about journalism and abuse of power and The Post. All the President's Men more than holds up after all these years. The Post won't hold up after a day and a half.

This is another phone it in performance by Streep. Boy, she sure can cry. It'll be a shame if she takes away a Best Actress nomination from a more deserving Jessica Chastain (Molly's Game is great) or Margot Robbie (terrific in I, Tonya).

It was a very “ra ra freedom of the press” kind of movie, but I think that’s what we need as a country. I loved Hanks’ character. He was very much hardnosed and set in his journalism integrity which was pretty inspiring. Streep was okay and did her job as well as she had to do. Effortless. But I wish her character was a bit stronger. The bit at the end with the women looking up to her was a bit pandering, but my mom, who I watched it with, enjoyed that part. She said that she wished it led the audience along more because it was hard to understand who was who, which I can agree. She suggested text descriptions for characters. But I think it would treat the audience as dummies. I followed it okay not knowing the story beforehand. I liked Spielberg’s camera work. It was smooth and unobtrusive. Used some creative-ish shots.

I'm willing to bet all of the big stars and recognizable names from this production knew about the sexual exploits in Hollywood but kept their mouth shut because it would destroy their career and in turn their possible film legacy.

I really like this movie, although not as much as I was hoping I would.  Seemed like pretty standard Spielberg fair.  I was hoping for something a little better.

Also, I've got to think there is a lot of revisionist history going on here.  Certainly Katharine Graham is a great role model, and I'm sure it took quite a bit of courage to back Bradlee during the company's public offering, but to portray her as the central hero of this story fighting against the patriarchy trying to pull her strings behind the scenes seems to be a bit of stretch.

>Also I know people hate it but the ending to this is so goofy I kind of love it.

I don't know if it should have gone that far, but maybe it was thematically appropriate.

[The Nixon administration and Justice Department's argument was that they were justified in seeking to prevent the Pentagon Papers from being published not because they were ashamed or embarrassed of what was in them, but because of the supposed impact on the ability of the federal government to function.](#spoiler)

[So it sort of makes sense that the movie is then book-ended by Watergate, it's the Nixon administration's stance on the Pentagon Papers issue taken to its philosophical extreme. Them thinking that because they're the lawmakers in Washington, that they make the law and are allowed to bend it to their will.](#spoiler)

They had also just floated on the stock market and their owner was a good friend of McNamara who wrote the report. There was more conflict and more jeopardy.

the visual storytelling Spielberg employs is unparalleled, it's sentimental without being too corny, and the camera movement and scene blocking (as is with any Spielberg picture), is better than anything else this year.  people who think this is badly directed or not impressively directed do not know what they're talking about

while other directors are being loud and obnoxious with their direction, the past decade (with the exception of BFG), Spielberg has been pumping out masterclass after masterclass in craft better than most things in their respective years, even if the movies themselves *cough War Horse, Bridge of Spies cough* haven't been super exciting things people can get behind.  he is somehow... the most underrated director of the 21st century",7q2oxj

Her overall performance wasn't amazing but I got something out of that scene and this movie that I probably knew before but hadn't really been made to feel. I think it eclipsed Michelle Williams's Gail Harris Getty in *All the Money in the World*.

I don't really get the idea either that because Kay Graham was rich/influential, that's she's somehow unfit to be the subject of a movie... I think if the character had been a man and the story basically the same about a man trying to save his family's newspaper business amidst the scandal and reveal of a government cover-up, no one would have questioned the appropriateness.

Broadly, Best Direction should reward the cumulative effect of the guy or gal at the top making tons of tiny decisions and helping his keys achieve a cohesive, fully realized vision that supports the film's themes and thesis.

They rushed a script that was out there. They optioned the script from a first time screenwriter (good for her) and then paired her with Oscar winning writer Josh Singer (Spotlight). They rushed into production. This had Oscar bait all over it.

So let's talk about journalistic integrity. Bradlee sending a reporter to spy on another reporter to break a story? Not sure that's in the journalist handbook. But, OK, let's say that's creative license. McNamara not being such a bad guy because I know him from a cocktail party? Yeah, let's give him, JFK and LBJ a pass because it's really Nixon that's the bad guy and we all know what bad stuff he's going to do.

The Big Sick got an SAG ensemble nomination and a nomination for Holly Hunter, beat out The Post for a WGA nomination, beat Lady Bird for Best Comedy, and got a bunch of Critics Choice Award nominations (I still think The Post is probably slightly ahead of The Big Sick though due to it missing at the BAFTAs and Golden Globes).

The Vietnam War is a top example for a concept called the sunk cost fallacy AKA the irrational escalation of commitment. I encourage you to read about it. But I’ll demonstrate it for you. First, the analogy you failed to dismantle: 

Case 1 OR 2:
1. Knowledge: You know OR don’t know the war against Southern Vietnam is unbeatable.

> In other words, the outcome is the same whether you know or you don’t know the truth: you accomplish nothing you hoped to accomplish. 

The point of my analogy is this. Rational people do not fight walls or armies they know they cannot defeat. The reason the Vietnam War is scandalous is (obviously) because the government knew the war was impossible to win while the public did not know this. That’s the scandal. The government misled the people providing the bodies. 

The NYT/WaPo led the effort to bring truth to the American public. Once the public knew that the government had exaggerated its claims of progress, withdrawal came swiftly. Indeed, Americans died for worse than nothing in Vietnam: they ended up dying because we didn’t want to be humiliated – *they ended up dying because we didn’t want to admit what we knew*! The war was impossible to win.

Yes, but they are the default directorial decisions. You could sub in any director, tell them not to get creative with their direction, and get the same result that you got here.

Literally every director has to do this. The thing is, it is much harder to decide where to position several cameras than it is to decide where to position one or 2. It is way harder to communicate a vision of complicated sets and costumes to production designers and costume designers than early 2000s clothes and generic suburban homes. It is much harder to make sure the sound mixing works the way it should on a film with a large amount of sound effects than it is in a film where for the most part the only noise is talking and a bit of background music.

""Exaggerating claims of progress"" is normal during wartime, as many battles are won in irrational situations. 

To never try is to simply allow the enemy to win. And troop demoralization via propaganda is one way of defeating the enemy. 

The Vietnam war was part of a larger offensive against Soviet satellite communists, against China, the Khmer Rouge, North Korea, Laos, etc. 

The war was totally justified by Congress - regardless of what journalists thought to write about. ",7q2oxj

dsr117h,">>Saying there wasn't much directing in Ladybird because it didn't have any obvious/flashy direction is like saying an acting performance is bad if they don't say any words.

>You seem to be saying that all direction is equal, which would make awards for the best direction meaningless.

No, even in your incorrect comprehension that doesn't make sense. Adding words to an actors performance doesn't make it better, just like taking words away from an actor's performance doesn't make it worse. Adding more stuff to a directors plate doesn't make it better, not does stripping stuff away make it worse.

But all of that is moot because I'm not trying to make any value claim to what is or isn't ""good"" direction. I am specifically arguing that there is ""less"" direction in Ladybird. You started by saying

>the direction mattered less in it because there was less stuff to direct.

But have now pivoted to arguing that the direction actually was bad when she made all of the decisions that  every other director makes on every production ever. Again I'm not arguing whether the direction is good or bad.

>Yes, but they are the default directorial decisions. You could sub in any director, tell them not to get creative with their direction, and get the same result that you got here.....it is much harder to decide where to position several cameras than it is to decide where to position one or 2. It is way harder to communicate a vision of complicated sets and costumes to production designers and costume designers than early 2000s clothes and generic suburban homes. It is much harder to make sure the sound mixing works the way it should on a film with a large amount of sound effects than it is in a film where for the most part the only noise is talking and a bit of background music.

Again I'm not arguing that Gerwigs decisions were or were not bland and uninspired.",7q2oxj

dsr1jyu,"I'm not saying that the direction needed to be inspired and I think Lady Bird is a great movie. Here is my point. The job of a director is to impose their directorial vision on a movie. Gerwig didn't impose a unique directorial vision on Lady Bird. She did a great job writing it, but other than getting good performances out of her actors (which you could say for many films that aren't being considered for Best Director at all, such as The Big Sick, The Disaster Artist, and I Tonya), what did her being the director contribute to the film that someone else couldn't have? Lady Bird was great without a unique directorial vision driving it because it didn't need one, but that doesn't mean the direction should be lauded.",7q2oxj

It's pretty evident that you know nothing about what finance is and never even took a business class, you make all sorts of assumption talking about business school.

Business school, especially finance, is just case studies and a whole lot of maths you have to go through to understand models and analysis (porter/dupont analysis, DCF, etc. which are finance 101). And yes CFA is one of the hardest designation to get. It's not the hardest degree, but for a designation it is. I'd put actuaries a bit above that but many CFAs actually are actuaries.

I don't need to be hedged against that, because you people are all spineless cowards (which is a big part of why you are where you are, and I am where I am).  Even when you had a million people sitting right outside the building, there wasn't a soul among you bold enough to make a real move.

You should really keep away from these types of power fantasies.  They fulfill a part of your brain that dreams of more, and in turn makes you ok with the mindless lethargy the consumes the rest of your life and leads to an existence that amounts to little more than treading water.",7q2oxj
