dswjxmu,"Has anyone here actually stuck their thing into a peach/apricot before? Is that actually a thing teenagers did/do and I just missed the memo at the time? I absolutely love this one, however I was deeply offended when Timothée, without a single care, allowed the juices from the peach to drip onto the bed sheets. I mean, good heavens, that was wrong.",7rfed5

dswlgy1,Armie Hammer needs to make more movies where he dances.,7rfed5
dt4brg7,"There were many scenes in this movie that stuck with me, most of which have probably been discussed to death here (the dad, the peach, the sheer pleasure of sitting around reading, swimming, and doing whatever you want unsupervised).

I think as an American, one of the things that stuck to my bones was how the parents reacted to their son's sexuality. I don't mean his homosexuality. I mean, sexuality as a whole. Despite most of the key characters being American, they all have a European sensibility that it very rare to see here in the US. One could argue that the movie itself could be making a social comment about open, honest European views of sex vs. moralizing, restrictive American views.

First, the parents see their son is attracted to a man, so they do things to help facilitate that attraction by giving them the idea to travel alone together. They also let Elio and Oliver have their space in the house - they aren't monitoring Elio or ""checking up on him,"" which I found refreshing.

Second, the parents are genuinely always there for Elio in helping him discuss sexual relationships. He is able to say to his parents out loud, ""I could never be that open,"" a vulnerable statement I have trouble imagining expressing to my parents. They simply reassure him; they don't nag or moralize him about sex. Of course, there's the scene with the father discussing his own sexual past and desires, openly and without judgment that exemplifies this behavior.

Third, the adults in the movie treat Elio respectfully with regards to his sexual encounters. For example, when Elio greets the older gay couple with Marzia and quickly gives her a kiss and loving pat, the adults simply maturely greet her and say hello. No one says ""Ohhhhhhh! You have a GIRRRLFRIENND!!!!!!!!!"" In the US, I find it typical that adults make teasing comments and condescending ""jokes"" about ""how cute it is to have a crush"" to teenagers. This moralizing can make teens internalize that they are doing something wrong, when they are actually doing something natural.

To see adults treat Elio respectfully and collegially, like a mature young adult for whom sex is one of many natural, positive experiences, filled me with hope, jealousy, and a strong feeling about the kind of parent I'd like to be if/when I have teenagers. It's not very common you walk out of a movie thinking, ""This movie has changed or informed the way I want to live my life"" but this one has for me.

Last, I think we are in a particular time where we are really looking back on the 1980s with a specific nostalgia for a time when kids could just be kids, ride their bikes everywhere, have adventures, be home for dinner, then go out again and have more unsupervised adventures. Stranger Things, It, and CMBYN all are really tapping in to that nostalgia, albeit in slightly different ways.",7rfed5
dswo3qb,That brief 4th wall break at the end of Visions of Gideon... it just hit something very emotionally raw in me.,7rfed5

dswjai4,"While I thought Elio and Oliver make the perfect couple, I did feel bad for Marzia. The moment Elio gets Oliver he completely forgets about her and when she confronts him about it, he's like ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ ",7rfed5
dswzr3l,"Fun Fact: Armie Hammer and Timothee Chalamet stayed and bonded on location a month before the actual filming. They got ample time to know each other very well and spend time with each other doing most of what happened in the movie too. 

And they admittedly said that this is the primary reason why their on-screen chemistry really worked and felt so genuine.

In my opinion, their on-screen chemistry is one of the best and most authentic I’ve ever seen. You can really feel their intimacy especially during the sensual scenes. And that’s why them parting really affected me deeply. ",7rfed5

dswk03w,"Did anyone else feel like the story kept baiting and switching typical romance/gay tropes.

I thought the notebook Elio left on the bed would get discovered, it didn’t.

I thought maybe Oliver and Elio’s papers would get mixed up in the backpack but they didn’t.

I thought they would get caught having sex but they didn’t.

Maybe this last one is a stretch but I kinda expected that call at the end to be about AIDS but it wasn’t (I’m blaming that on watching Dallas Buyers Club a couple days prior).",7rfed5

dswiitw,"My pick for best movie of 2017. 

I just loved the whole atmosphere of this film, from the music to the pacing to the naturalistic acting. I think it was refreshing to see an LGBT romance that was allowed to be just that, a romance, without focusing on any sort of overt obstacle like violent aggressors, disapproving parents, AIDS, etc. (Although I would understand if people think that makes the film disingenuous). 

Everyone always talks about Timothee's last scene, and deservedly so, but I was super impressed with his physical acting throughout the whole film, as he clearly has some strong instincts as an actor that are rare for someone his age. ",7rfed5
dswjwok,"Can we please talk about the flies? Those weren't coincidental. Anyone have any take away from them?

My biggest was the way in which they represented us the audience. I truly felt like a fly on the wall just observing someone's experience similarly to how I did when I saw Boyhood. I was almost uncomfortable during the sex scenes because it felt like something I shouldn't be seeing because it's their moment and they should be able to have it without spectators.",7rfed5
dswk6a7,"Just got out of this movie. It was...devastatingly beautiful. It’s a movie that I’ll be thinking about for a while. 

I’m a bisexual Indian-American guy who didn’t grow up in the cultured natural paradise that Elio lives in, or with parents as open-minded as his are. What’s more, I haven’t ever felt ~~true love~~ powerful, intense, passionate obsessive infatuation like Elio did. His experience should have felt totally alien to me. Yet, I felt his infatuation, frustration, passion, heartbreak as if they were my own. Chalamet did a phenomenal job. 

The cinematography was great. The languid and lingering shots, and even the abrupt jumps, made it feel like a long yet fleeting summer. 

The father’s monologue at the end nearly had me in tears, especially when he told Elio not to suppress his sadness. And that credit sequence...oh man.

There were parts that fell a bit flat for me. The pacing was a bit off at times, and the romance did seem a bit rushed initially. However, overall, I am very happy I saw this movie, and have a feeling I’ll revisit it time and again.",7rfed5
dswibjt,"I could watch Michael Stuhlbarg read an encyclopedia. 

Easily my favorite film of the year. ",7rfed5
dswpcll,"As a gay man, I had a very hard time watching this movie the first time through. The ""moment of discovery"" is so ubiquitous in gay romances like this, that I spent the whole film anxious waiting for the shoe to drop. I went back and watched it again with the knowledge that it never does and enjoyed the film even more the second time.

It truly is one of the greatest ""first love""  movies I've ever seen. The phone call at the end was the standout for me. Timothy Chalamet deserves an oscar nod for that scene alone. You can physically see all his feelings slamming into him. It's a truly outstanding showcase of subtle physicality. He's officially added to my list of must-watch actors.",7rfed5
dswlr6p,"Well, I've been sitting on this for about a month and having seen the movie twice now I can say it's one of my favorite movies of all time. I was excited for this movie for a while, but still didn't expect to be completely floored by the entire thing.

This movie is a masterpiece and the best portrayal of firsts (sex, love, heartbreak) I have ever seen. Everything in the movie felt so real, it truly brings you back to your first love. It makes you feel the wave of emotions that you felt the first time you fell in love.

Timothee Chalamet gives an absolutely mesmerizing performance in this movie. I can't begin to express how talented he is. He completely encompasses Elio. Honestly the first time around I barely even took note of the other amazing performances here because my eyes were glued to Timothee the whole time. Armie Hammer is fantastic as well, I was able to relate to him and his role in the situation. He is very conflicted, sometimes warm, sometimes cold. And Michael Stuhlbarg is great as well, he has such a presence on screen.

The music in this movie is what I can only describe as beautiful, Sufjans songs in particular stand out as incredibly moving. Visions of Gideon is an absolute soul crusher. The music added to the atmosphere of the movie, which was so warm and peaceful. It was so refreshing to see a movie about two men in a relationship that didnt end with one of them dying or angry parents, nothing of the sort. Time is the villain here, and I think that makes it all the more tragic.

I will say while I love the movie, it didn't have the profound effect it did on me until the scene with Mr. Perlman near the end. I'm not someone who is easily affected by movies and shows but that monologue destroyed me. It's a universal message to anyone feeling pain and on a more personal note something I needed to hear. I had been pushing away and trying to just forget certain things in my life but after seeing this movie I felt a whirlwind of emotions that led me to finally being able to be happy about past relationships rather than bitter. I guess you could say this movie changed my life and how I view relationships going forward.

Overall, Call Me By Your Name is a deeply moving film about love with a fantastic performances, amazing atmosphere, and a few scenes that will stick with you (the monologue, Elio by the fire). I can't recommend it enough. ",7rfed5

dswk1r5,"What do we think of the title 'Call Me By Your Name?' What's the significance? I have my thoughts, but I've been trying to find what other people think, and I haven't seen too much discussion on it. I'm wondering if I've been reading too much into it or if I'm being too obvious. What is the significance of the act of calling each other by their own name mean? I would love to hear some opinions.",7rfed5
dsx6mat,"Did anyone see that interview where Armie Hammer talks about how the director was like ""okay we're going to do this scene."" And they flipped through the script and all it said was ""Oliver and Elio roll in the grass and make out."" 

And they were like ... ok, here we go. So they start to make out and Luca is like ""no, no, get into it"". 

So they go at it again and they're rolling around and making out. And they're still making out ... and finally one of them looks up and Luca had walked away. I dont know why but I just about died laughing! They also said it was great to film bc they only film like 7, 8 hour days (not like the US where they film 12 hour days). So they got to spend a lot of time hanging out and walking through the city they were filming in. 

edit: also when the dad talks to Elio at the end, I was bawling. And I personally would say this film feels more coming-of-age than LGBTQ ... I'm not quite sure why. Probably because it doesnt match the tone of the LGBTQ movies I've seen (Boys Dont Cry, anyone?) and the focus is on Elio, with his age and the pain of losing that first love ... the bisexual part seemed to be an accessory to all those other things.

dt1r768,"I did some searching and..I can’t be the only one who noticed the continuous take statue scene..?

The take starts when Elio and Oliver pull up to the shop on their bikes. Oliver goes in and buys a pack of cigarettes and comes back out, offering one to Elio. They walk the bikes over to the statue and rest them on the gate. They talk about the statue and their feelings as they circle it. Oliver then goes into (I believe) a printing shop and comes back out saying how they misprinted his work. They get back onto their bikes and ride away and the take ends.

There are most likely cuts whenever the camera pans up to the statue and building, but still..it was beautifully done.

THIS is the scene everyone should be talking about. ",7rfed5

But!

It just wasn't interesting. I tried engaging with this movie for two hours and it never spoke to me. Which is a shame because everyone seems to have found something truly special speaking to them, and I'm left scratching my head wondering if I missed something or if I'm just broken.",7rfed5
dswkat1,"I was OBSESSED with this film for days after watching it. The last time a film triggered such a reaction in me was when I watched Blue Valentine and the Before Sunset trilogy. CMBYN tells such a straightforward but intimate coming-of-age story about many firsts - our first crush, our first kiss, our first sexual experience and our first heartbreak. Whether watching it as a gay or straight person, the film is universal in that aspect, and it is so easy to relate with Elio and his yearning for Oliver. There were many misty eyes in my theatre during Elio’s chat with his dad towards the end, including mine. The soundtrack only amplified what is already a wonderful film on its own.

For what it’s worth, the book is an equally excellent read and a personal recommendation of mine. I devoured it within a day and found it a good way to get a better understanding of Elio’s thoughts and feelings, which were often left unspoken during the film. If you’re into audiobooks, Armie Hammer also does a reading of it.",7rfed5

Something I haven't seen much comment on:  the brief breaking of the 4th wall when Elio looks right at the camera during the final scene and smiles. He does this right after his mother calls him to dinner, saying ""Elio"". I think he does this because he realizes that from now on every time someone calls him by his name he'll be reminded of Oliver.  And by breaking the 4th wall he's letting us in on that fact.  Thoughts?",7rfed5

For days after reading it I couldn't get it out of my mind. I'm gay (although I don't remotely think you need to be to enjoy and appreciate this book/movie) and both the book and movie just moved me so damn much.

Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer really done the characters justice in bringing them to life, I felt as if I knew them. Every sideways glance, slight smirk or quick look away said so much.

And Michael Stuhlbarg's speech had me in tears, not to mention the final shot.

We have the opening text about it being “Somewhere in Northern Italy” and the series of scenes discussing French fairy tales all coupled with a narrative that especially from a queer perspective feels almost fantastical with all the highs of a great first love and *gasp* incredibly accepting parents. 

There is a sense of magical realism that is undercut by the harsh realties of life in the end, but damn if I don’t want to live in the world of Elio and Oliver’s Italian summer for forever. ",7rfed5

I do feel that Armie deserves to be getting as much praise as Timothee and Michael because Oliver is not an easy role. We're not given an idea of what his side of the story is like in the book and even the film it is hard - but what we do see is what Armie brings to him. He makes him seem untouchable and confident when he first gets there, but there are little looks and actions he does that shows that it really is just a facade he has learnt to project to the world, and when he is with Elio, he can sort of shed that a bit and be himself. I especially liked that smile he gives Elio right after they sleep together for the first time, it's this kind of hopeful but sad smile because Elio is suddenly acting really strange and you can tell Oliver is thinking ""what have I done? have I ruined this?"". It is a really understated performance and I hope he gets an Oscar nod.

Obviously he isn’t straight, but the movie makes it clear that sexuality is fluid (hence the part where the father and Oliver discus the positions of the statues). Some people are more straight and some more gay (bent, not standing straight). Additionally this is conveyed through Elio having sex (and enjoying it) with Marzia. Clearly he is not fully straight, but he lies somewhere in a grey area. And as someone who is bisexual, I very much appreciate this statement. ",7rfed5

It has this transcendent empathy that you feel, no matter gay, straight, bi whatever, it takes you back to that first true heartbreak you experience in your life. That railway scene was great too. I've literally done what he did in that station. I called my parents after my first real girlfriend in high school broke up with me and I could even get the words out to ask to get picked up and I had to call my dad back after losing it. 

That being said, the movie had a huge major flaw and that is the confusing beginning part of the movie. I felt no real attraction or love between the two. They showed no signs of affection. If i didn't know the plot of the movie already I would've thought they had some sort of older brother/younger brother relationship then all of a sudden they're at the fountain and then all of a suddenly they're all over each other near the pond/river/body of water. It all felt really rushed and discombobulated. ",7rfed5
dswo44m,"I'll be among the dissent on this one - while by no means *bad* I found this one of my biggest disappointments of the year. 

The film feels like it substitutes sex for intimacy, and that's this film's biggest problem for me - I never *felt* the bond between these two people, I felt like I was just told it. Fittingly enough, my 3 favorite films of the last 3 years have all been gay or lesbian dramas (Duke of Burgendy, Carol, and Moonlight respectively) - because the bond felt real between those people. There was no *moment* in this for me. It all just sort of...happened? For example, that scene in the car in Carol where You Belong to Me plays softly in the background...I absolutely adore it. It carries more emotional weight for me than the entirety of CMBYN combined. 

I recall reading a letterboxd review about how this movie doesn't do any one particular thing great. Summer fling? Standard romance? Starcrossed lovers sort of situation? I wouldn't go so far as to say there was nothing there, but I remember wondering what the father saw in that relationship in his (dare I say, borderline pandering) monologue near the end. 

It's disappointing, because I don't quite know what didn't do it for me. I thought Chamolet did a fine job - I'm less impressed by the bulk of advocates for him earing best actor at the academy awards, but I won't deny his success here - and Hammer felt like he did his role there. This movie just felt like it missed that...something.

I loved the Sufjan Stevens songs, as well, but the disappointing thing is that they made me feel very easily more emotion than anything in the film. A few chuckles here and there and such, but things like that ending credits scene that apparently destroyed a fair number of viewers? I just didn't feel anything at it. 

I don't hate the movie or even necessarily dislike it, but this is actually the first time I've thought about the movie since I'd seen it a few weeks ago. Maybe excessive expectations were at play, to be sure, but this just isn't memorable for me. ",7rfed5
dswjqls,"This was probably in my Top 3 movies of the year. There's already enough discussion on the quality of actors, score, and that one monologue from Michael Stuhlbarg, so I'll discuss something that I haven't seen come up yet, which is cinematography and the use of sex in the film. Despite being about a gay romance, we're shown several scenes of Elio's straight ventures, while being given suggestive shots of the two men throughout the film, only for the camera to pan away at the actual shot. I believe that his wasn't some form of queerbaiting, but instead a deliberate choice to further the ideas of the statues as a reoccurring motif. Imo one of the most overlooked parts of the movie was the gorgeous cinematography, and I saw many parallels as I was watching between the poses and natural play of light and shadow on classical statues, and the way which the two lead characters were framed by the camera. So in purposefully holding the actual romantic sex from the audience, that sense of untouched beauty that Stuhlbarg's character and others discuss in the statues becomes applied to their romance as well - it feels more ephemeral and untouched when compared to the realistic but ultimately unfulfilling straight relationship which Elio pursues.",7rfed5

dswor7g,"The movie reminded me of a lot of the old Merchant Ivory romances (no surprise since James Ivory wrote the first draft of the script) like Howard's End or A Room with a View. It has that delicacy and sensuality and allows us to revel in Elio's self-discovery and his emotional development. Unlike other movies on this topic, there's no judgment here and you can feel the love (be it between Elio and Oliver or Elio and his family) in every scene. What talk there is of homophobia is minimal and quickly ignored. A lot of people have been criticizing it for existing in that bubble but I think it's what makes the movie work. It's a pure love story.",7rfed5

The movie is brilliant, it shows the meaning of falling in love, the way a musician feels and sees the world, the way parents affect a child's life. Besides all of this, it also brings the importance of culture and knowledge.

I think this became one of my fav movies of all time.",7rfed5

dvai45x,"This movie was just beautiful. It felt so naturalistic, so real, and so very european. The mix of languages actually made me believe americans and europeans are very alike and the mixing of these cultures kinda brought us together. 

The film looks so aesthetically pleasing. The 80s nostalgia is all over it. Especially Timothées wardrobe was so stylish. 

As a straight dude, I was so moved by the realness of their romance and how they were conflicted between girls and being gay. I thought Luca Guadagnino did a terrific job balancing the two. He just did a great job overall.

My only complaint has nothing to do with the film itself but with the fucking audience who got up right as the credits started rolling and didn’t give the film time to end and absorb the emotions. Lots of ignorant teens in the audience who don’t respect movies enough as an artform and are too addicted to their phones and therefore cant wait for a film to end. It completely ruined the final scene for me. I was getting really into it and then...lots of noise. The majority of people stayed quiet and watched the final scene but some people are just ignorant as fuck.

I was fine initially and towards the end but to me the middle 50% dragged *so hard* and felt *so slow* that I was really struggling to stop my thoughts wandering elsewhere (and please bear in mind I'm not some guy with poor taste and a low attention-span, I've enjoyed and paid attention to many other very long movies). I can't really find any specific faults so I know it's a well made, well shot and well acted movie, but it just didn't hook me at all and I'm a bit disappointed after hearing all the hype :/

Personally I'd give it a 7.5/10, I really wanted to like it but it felt way too long for me and I found myself bored quite often. I think I'd still support it winning certain awards like acting and soundtrack/song though, but personally I preferred a lot of the other best picture frontrunners.

The infamous peach scene was also... odd, maybe I'm more prudish than I thought, but the whole thing made me squirm uncomfortably in my seat.

It's been really hard for me to move on from this movie because it has opened my eyes to so many things it has been missing. It gave me the courage to come out to my parents, and made me long for that first love which sadly I have never experienced yet(I'm from a place where same sex relationships arent the norm and its just now that Ive fully embraced my sexuality). The movie was really liberating. I have been doing all the best I can to get over this movie because the sadness caused by it is taking a toll on my daily activities.

Maybe i just didnt get it, maybe it was just kind of irritating how a doctorate intern wasnt seen much doing work as Elio doing anything but be almost naked or always half naked in good lighting and ""look at me, im bored"" moments. For something that attempted to be relatable (not as a gay movie but as a love story), it was very hard to envision the kind of relationship forming.

I watched the rest (haven’t seen The Post yet, but doubt it would be a major contender now) and I’ve been underwhelmed by almost all movies this season. Yesterday my friends asked me what movies should they watched, thought about all the movies and told them they must see movie this season is Call Me By Your Name. The more I think of this movie, the more amazing it is, the cinematography, the acting, the direction, the oners, the music, etc. 

It shows love can be between two people irrelative of gender. Should show this movie to people who’re anti-LGBT. The two lead characters snuggly fit. You feel how they connect. The cherry on top is Shultbart, he’s been killing it in supporting character roles for the past 4/5 years. While watching this movie, I felt warmth, I felt happy, I could feel the bond between them. Some people had problems with Hammer’s casting but I loved it, I’m not gay but that dude is a fine specimen, I get why a teen would swoon over him. 

The peach scene threw me off. How did you guys interpret it? I had a weird interpretation, he’s been experimenting sexually due to boredom, he’s bored with just reading and swimming everyday, he knows he can get chicks without a problem, it’s not a matter of if but when. So I thought he’s bored in Italy, wanting a sexual challenge, he tries for Oliver, someone above his league and out of his gender. It’s just one interpretation, I’m probably not right but I was thrown off by it. ",7rfed5

The sexual tension at the beginning.. I was completely feeling it myself. Perhaps it's a testament to Timothee's acting but I could truly relate to him in so many ways. His longing. His awkwardness. Daring himself to go further. Letting go.

And then Michael Stuhlbarg's monologue at the end... I'll be thinking about that for a while. Don't rush the heartbreak. Let yourself feel the pain as much as the love. There's nothing worse than being apathetic to it all. They're truly words to live by.

This movie has beautiful moments that I think are elevated by the music, the location, and the acting. There is a whimsical nature to it all that brings you back, and makes you feel like one of those summers where you fell in love, and now it's something you look back on like a dream you don't want to wake up from.

Despite this I can't get over how predatory this film felt for me. Maybe that just comes from my own belief system, but I couldn't help but cringe at times. This is a movie I feel like NAMBLA will show at all of their orientations, and meet ups. It's about man boy love, and at times I felt it gets super uncomfortable.

Timothee Chamltee is great in this no doubt, but he plays a 17 year old who looks like he could pass for a 14 year old. And he has a sexual relationship with a man his late? 30s. (i've since read that Hammers character is suppose to be 24. He looks like he's in his mid 30s, and Timothee's character looks like he's 14 years old. At no point do they make their actual age difference clear.)

I couldn't get past this dynamic. I couldn't buy into their love, because I felt like Timothee's character was being exploited the whole time.


I think this movie has a lot to say about lost love, and about growing up, and finding yourself. I did like it a lot, but for the reasons I gave above it made it hard for me to really love it.

I think the film left a lot of space for the actors to independently shape the roles and Timothée Chalamet managed to make the most of that and create a compelling character, but absolutely no aspect of Armie Hammer’s character was believable to me.  I didn’t believe his intellect and I really did not at all believe his attraction to Elio.  It felt like instead of taking the sparseness of his character and trying to make what he could of him, he just floundered and the character wound up being totally empty because of it.  Also, he played the character way too old - he was already at a disadvantage because he clearly looks like a man in his 30s, but instead of downplaying that, he acted *even older.*

Every actor really expressed so much emotion with such understated brilliance, the performances somehow simultaneously seemed naturalistic yet consciously considered down to the smallest minutiae.

Timothee Chalamet deserves the Oscar and this is coming from a Gary Oldman fanboy. His gestures, his movement, his mannerisms. He said so much without even speaking. Armie, Mike Stuhlbarg, the whole European cast really never struck a false chord with me.

The only moment that remotely took me out of the experience was the first Sufjan Stevens song. It was good but I was so immersed in the 1983-mess of the setting that it was jarring to hear his voice. The second song, ""Visions of Gideon"" was perfect however. 

Really just let this film wash over you. Don't worry about a twisty-turny plot-filled narrative and really focus on how it makes you feel. ",7rfed5
dsx7ni9,"i'm ready for the downvotes, but it was boring.  armie hammer's character just wasn't engaging to me.  timothy delivered a fantastic performace tho. i will say that.  the story was just extremely boring to me.  ",7rfed5

dswigs6,"Really loved it. B+/A- for me, but i’d Still give it 4 out of 4 stars.

Great cinematography and I thought TC did a great job of conveying the longing and heartbreak that comes with the loss of your first love. 

That last scene and credits song was about as perfect a closing as i’ve Seen and TC acts that out very well.

My one criticism is that the relationship blossoms pretty much out of nowhere and doesn’t quite feel “earned.” There’s just not really a strong hint for either of them that they may both be having conflicted feelings towards one another. Unlike in “lady bird,” where Lucas hedges character is given subtle hints into his struggles with his sexuality, TC’s character is not.

Still, once they did get together, I thought the movie captured their desires perfectly; the father’s speech at the end also was quite touching!

I imagine in this universe, that TC’s character will one day be comforted in having such supportive parents and find consolation in the adage that “tis better to have loved and lost than never having loved at all.”",7rfed5

dsxsntn,"Beautiful movie but I was not familiar with the book and I had no idea Oliver was supposed to be 24. I figured he was like 35. It kind of ruined the movie for me because the whole time I'm like, how is nobody commenting on the fact that this 35 year old is hooking up with this 17 year old kid.

Then after the movie, my friend tells me he was supposed to be 24...which like I would have been fine with. But that was not my impression watching it. Armie Hammer was so good but I think they should have chosen a different actor.",7rfed5
dswmps6,"I personally wasn't much of a fan of it. It was alright, but the age difference felt worse than I expected it to (the problem is that Armie Hammer still looked 30 in this while Timothee Chalamet only looked 15ish), Elio seemed a bit creepy (he spied on Oliver from the window and masturbated to him, he bragged to Oliver about seeing the girl who he was dancing with naked, he wrote notes saying that he would rather die than have Oliver not talk to him, and when Oliver initially turns him down, Elio gropes him), the movie felt a bit too repetitive (Elio goes swimming at least 6 or 7 times in the movie), I didn't like how Elio and Oliver don't have any nonsexual interaction in-between the first time they have sex and when it is time for Oliver to leave, and Michael Stuhlbarg (who is by far the best part of this movie) was extremely underused. I'd give it a 7/10. I'm glad other people liked it more than I did though.",7rfed5

dt0iw9j,"I enjoyed it, but consider it very overrated.  The infatuation never felt like real love, but a brief high school fling between a horny teen and a grad student with questionable judgement. The entire affair was 6 weeks, followed by at least 12 weeks before the closing scene, and Elio still hadn't gotten over it?  

Others blame this on Hammer's acting, and perhaps that's true. But I also blame it on writing and directing.  For comparison, ""Something Like Summer"", a movie with much lower production values and a more contrived plot, with plenty of flaws, still succeeds at getting the infatuation and love across in the first act.  CMBYN was never more than horniness and naïveté until the last scene. ",7rfed5
dsy7zzf,"The Father Talk scene is one of the most heart-warming, beautiful, and inspiring scene I've ever seen on a movie. It's relatable for me in so many levels. Shed a lot of tears during that monologue. Wonderful movie.",7rfed5

Truly a superb ending and an exquisite artistic achievement ",7rfed5
dsyz449,"I found it interesting they keep focusing so much on fruit. 

When something sexual happens - cut to fruit. Then one of the characters actually has sex WITH a piece of fruit. 

There is a heavy and sort of unexplored online ""fruit"" theme to the movie. 

Fruit being the end result of sexual reproduction between plants, their way to pass on their genes to offspring and reproduce, but also the pejorative term used for gay people IE ""he's a fruit"". I think there is a LOT of potential layers to this repeated and heavy handed visual symbolism. 

For example - when the characters meet and their love is budding into existence it's summer and the fruit is in full glory on the trees around the estate, they are constantly able to just reach up and grab some, the lush availability of the fruit is just ever present throughout these scenes, like we are in the garden of eden. 

But in the end scene when Oliver calls and says he is getting married there are extended shots of it being winter, and everything outside being dormant and dead. 

Just my two cents. I loved the use of fruit and the concepts it evokes to enhance the subliminal thoughts of the viewer about characters. 

ALSO I loved the scene where they are walking around the fountain. This is where they first break the ice and actually talk to each other about  how they feel about each other. They start out together on one side of the circle, and they drift apart from each other as they walk around - the giant physical statue coming between them - but then Elio speaks his mind about how he feels - and then the characters start around the 2nd half of the circle and start coming toward each other again physically - and you might note, they never actually reach the same spot and get together COMPLETELY on the other side, they just get very close to each other. 

I think that fountain scene is a metaphor for the entire movie itself. 

",7rfed5
dt1du5t,I went into the movie not knowing what to make of it. A little slow at times but scenes didn’t last very long and got going. I fell in love with these two. I guess I was a little emotional because of personal things in my life that I connected to in the movie but it was a nice whisk into a beautiful love story. It’s a relationship people get jealous of not having. But I loved the music. It was so beautiful at times and haunting at times. It carried dread and love. I think the fathers speech at the end was poetic and beautiful. I liked that the father alluded to the sculptures as daring to desire them right as Oliver was falling for Elliot. I was just so damn sad after watching it. But I like feeling sad sometimes with movies. It was a beautiful film that’ll be with me for awhile. I think it could have used more of Elliot’s feelings towards Oliver because its hard to tell he likes him in the beginning. But it was a great film. ,7rfed5
dt1wnpx,"Shoot, kind of late to the discussion. Overall this was probably the best film I've seen in years. Really amazing acting and a genuine chemistry between the lead 2 actors. Also cried like a bitch during the dad's monologue and the last scene...

I did have a question, why was ellio acting kind of stand-offish after the first time him and oliver had sex? I mean he was starting to have oliver concerned. Not sure if I was reading correctly the way ellio was acting during the swim at the pond and how he was when came back to house, but I just thought it was a little strange that he seemed to keep his distance.",7rfed5

Armie had to create a lot of Oliver's character and he's what made this story real for me. Elio was always the brave and forward one, Oliver was very hidden and he became so vulnerable when he gave in to Elio. It was that vulnerability and passion that has stuck with me!

dsxyhkm,"I'll be honest, I'm not sure where I stand on this film but I'm leaning towards disappointment.

I've seen a number of LGBT films, it's a genre I'm trying to dive into more and more each year, and this is the first LGBT film I've seen that hasn't relied on angst and drama to push its story forward. Which is great, it's about time that gay romances are allowed to have something light and easy, but at the same time without any drama the film was just sort of there, being all light and pretty and honestly rather dull.

I had the same problem with Guadagnino's last film, A Bigger Splash, it felt like something was suppose to happen but instead he made a very pretty but very hollow experience. Call Me By Your Name isn't as hollow, thanks mainly to Chalamet who has already mastered the art of subtle emotions, but without a central drama all I got was a by-the-numbers love story.

I guess that's equality in a way, romance can be dull regardless of orientation. I still recommend it, but the Awards talks are lost on me.",7rfed5

I was so skeptical I started watching it online out of boredom, but then a fourth of the way in, I felt like I needed to watch this beautiful movie on the big screen. Luca did such a great job at capturing at Italy and how beautiful it is, as well as this relationship. I saw some folks think it was just a summer fling.. For those that have been in love, or had something close to it, this just makes you reminisce and miss that. It made me so nostalgic. Timothee was so charming and real, I loved it. I already got the vinyl and poster, and rewatched the movie so many times. It was one of the last movies I saw to dust off 2017 ... along with The Florida Project, Three Billboards in Ebbing, Missouri, Phantom Thread, Lady Bird, The Shape of Water.. all great stuff but CMBYN just lingers with me.

dszjorq,"This FINALLY opened here on Thursday and I’ve already seen it twice, likely with more to follow.

This film has devastated me in the best and worst of ways and, after my second viewing, has become my favorite film of 2017. Timothée Chalamet deserves all of the praise he’s received and though Oldman is the one to beat, I would be thrilled to see him take home Best Actor.

As much as I loved this, it was not a perfect film and having just finished the novel, there are many, many small omissions I wish hadn’t been lost in translation and that the intimate scenes between Elio and Oliver didn’t feel as sanitized as they did; I didn’t need explicit, ‘9 Songs’- or ‘Love’-style sex scenes, but they came across as much more tame than I felt the film (and audience) deserved, especially after an hour-plus of build up. Still, for the most part, I am rather pleased with the way it was adapted.

Unlikely though it may be, I would love for this to receive a 4K release. I plan to revisit this as often as my heart can bear it.",7rfed5
dt1wlli,"Best Actor is more than likely going to go to Oldman or Day Lewis, but I wouldn't consider a win for Timothee an upset by any margin.

This movie didn't awe or inspire but it smashed its depiction of love lost out of the park. ",7rfed5
dt23uim,"Goddamn, this movie is just so good. ",7rfed5
dtd7ban,"Probably an unpopular opinion, but as a gay dude watching this movie, I really feel it allowed me to empathise with the characters a lot, namely Elio. I had a similar experience, but that's neither here nor there

I had a bit of an alternate character interpretation of Oliver. I spent a lot of the beginning of the movie seeing things from Elio's perspective and being infatuated by Oliver and rooting for the romance. I found myself wishing that a good-looking friend of my father's had moved in when I was 17 and my hormones were going wild all the time, that would have been heaven. As the movie went on, however, I started to remember how immature I truly was at 17 and it changed my perspective on things. I don't see this as a tragic love story, though I do empathize with Elio and the heartbreak he feels at the end after Oliver gets done using him for his own pleasure, but to me, this is a man clearly taking advantage of an immature young adult who is still struggling to come to terms with his own sexuality. I think Oliver kind of realized that at points and so pulled away, which redeems him somewhat, but I still didn't find myself rooting for them to end up together anymore after probably the halfway point. 

Sidenote, Also felt really bad for Marzia. She got screwed over more than almost anybody. Haha. 

I also know that the age of consent is different in Italy, but going strictly off of what I know from interacting with 17 year olds and remembering what I do about myself at that age, I feel Oliver took advantage of Elio at some points. ",7rfed5
dv42ap5,"So if this was a ~30 year old Armie Hammer and a high school girl, we all still love this movie just as much right?

I'm being snarky, but honestly their age dynamic kind of weirded me out throughout the movie. I realize the character is supposed to be like 24ish and Hammer is only 29, but just the maturity, build, look, presence, etc of Hammer he might as well have been 30-35 in the movie, especially contrasting with Chalamet who was clearly like a high school age boy. And the way the parents were just kind of like ""oh look how cute they are, y'all are sweet, you're prolly gonna fuck my high school son tonight, maybe you guys should take a trip together..."" It just kind of made me uncomfortable. If it had been a more ""college looking"" kid I don't think that dynamic would have been as stark.

For example, go read the Good Time thread and plenty of people were grossed out by Pattisons character kissing a 16 year old girl in that movie. It's just interesting to me the different reaction.

All that said, Chalamet was excellent, that kid can act. Tons of subtlety and under the surface emotions you could feel. Pretty great. The setting was awesome too, makes me want to spend my summer in Italy and eat apricots and swim and read all day and ride my bike. The movie wasn't my favorite. I can't give it the same praise it gets around here although I thought it was good. Just kind of dragged in the middle for me. Beginning was interesting, ending was excellent, but when the hooking up was happening it got kind of boring for me. Like nothing really happened, just scene after scene of flirting and hooking up, I don't k is I guess I just wanted something to happen.",7rfed5

How do you guys deal with the fact that, despite everything, this movie depicts a relationship that, at least we here in many parts of the US, consider to be illegal? 

I understand that Elio is particularly precocious and mature; that he is the one who pursues Oliver; that his parents know and approve of the relationship; that he is at no point coerced into sex; that the age of consent in Italy is lower. 

But from an American legal perspective, this relationship is still illegal.

The pacing was painfully slow, and I didn't think there was anything particularly memorable about the cinematography that it was in service of. I never bought the relationship. The film never presented anything that made me believe Oliver and Elio were falling in love. That killed what I'm assuming was supposed to be a emotional 3rd act. I was really bothered by how their age gap was never mentioned, that undercut the father's speech at the end. I don't buy that any parent would be so nonchalant about their child in a relationship with an adult like that, regardless of the sexual orientation of it. Also there were tons of scenes that just felt straight up awkward. All of the dancing scenes, the weird cut to thermal cam, and the fish just to name a few. These things didn't add anything to film IMO and just had me asking WTF was that? Pulling me out of the movie.

About an hour in the only other couple in the theater walked out, I wish I would have followed their lead. I really wouldn't recommend this and think it's by far the weakest of the best picture candidates.",7rfed5
dt1tzmy,"This movie was just 'meh', I liked the atmosphere and music but there wasn't really a climax or emotional connection felt between Elio and Oliver. It's like they only physically liked each other and that's why they mostly just had sex on their free time, they never had a good conversation. They barely touched on the subject of Elio being so young as most couples would with an age gap like that, and when Oliver says the line ""call me by your name and I'll call you by mine"" It felt extremely forced, random, and cheesy.

Like everyone else I loved the dialogue at the end even though I didn't necessarily disagree with the whole message. 

In the pantheon of movies about gay men, I still think the obvious comparison to this is Moonlight, and Moonlight is a little better than Call Me By Your Name, which is no shame. Maybe I felt a little larger connection with the characters in Moonlight, they seemed more real to everyday people, while CMBYN did have an air of extremely rich people problems, or maybe I am just jealous of the amazing lifestyle the movie portrayed, having a villa in the Italian countryside is my lifelong dream.",7rfed5

In it, the Bovary character is young and full of lust, she wants to fuck this guy. She sees a flower, she grabs this flower, and she puts her finger into the flower. It’s an incredible scene about the sensuality in all things. So I thought, “Finally, we have a lead here that can make this scene doable.” Then I tried to put the deboned peach on me and it actually worked, it wasn’t just a metaphor! So I threw the peach away, composed myself, and went to Timothée and told him, “Timmy, I tried the peach myself, and it works. We can film the scene.” And he goes, “Of course it works!

I heard an Italian woman who grew up in the 80s also talking about how accurate everything was too--like the backpack Elio has is the cool brand that all the kids wanted.

>One day I tried, physically, to masturbate myself with a peach because I was asking Timothée to do it as a character, and I wanted to prove to myself that it was not doable so we would not have to do it. And actually, when I got the fruit and put my finger in the fruit and started to debone it, already that act gave me a cinephile memory, reminding me of a great moment in this version of Madame Bovary [called Abraham’s Valley] by Manoel de Oliveira, the great Portuguese filmmaker. In it, the Bovary character is young and full of lust, she wants to fuck this guy. She sees a flower, she grabs this flower, and she puts her finger into the flower. It’s an incredible scene about the sensuality in all things. So I thought, “Finally, we have a lead here that can make this scene doable.” Then I tried to put the deboned peach on me and it actually worked, it wasn’t just a metaphor! So I threw the peach away, composed myself, and went to Timothée and told him, “Timmy, I tried the peach myself, and it works. We can film the scene.” And he goes, “Of course it works! I tried it myself as well.”

But the one in the middle (pardon my ignorance on the song titles) completely took me out of the movie. He’s sitting on the steps and can’t hide how desperately he wants to see Oliver, which was beautifully portrayed.

dt2w4ls,"This is the first film I've seen in a theater centered around a gay romance. I think it was perfect.

The whole point of the LGBT movement is to be understood by other humans as a human, and this film accomplishes that by striving to tell a story instead of meeting an agenda.",7rfed5
dt02ibn,"Agreed about the lack of conventional LGBT obstacles. Maybe it's because I was born in the 90s but I was really surprised that everybody seemed so fine with them being together. Admittedly there are bits in the book where Oliver is on the lookout for passers-by so they aren't seen kissing etc 

I guess it's partly because of the artsy characters involved/potentially the location. Or maybe I had simply assumed everyone used to be homophobic across the board which evidently isn't true.

I had heard it had a sad ending so when I read the book (before seeing the film) I was dreading discovering Oliver had AIDs or something. It was a pleasant surprise that it wasn't the case.

I also really appreciate the depiction of Elio losing his... gay-virginity - ha! His nervousness, the tenderness etc. I haven't seen nearly enough LGBT films and as a bi person I'm really happy to finally see aspects that I've seen many times in depictions of straight couples.

Lastly, couldn't agree more about Timothee's physicality. He said so much with his movements and expressions. He's one of those actors you like to pay attention to even when the scene isn't focused on them.",7rfed5
dsxs0w2,[deleted],7rfed5
du44e8a,"I might be the only one but I feel as though calling this an LGBT film may kind of be missing the point. (To me) The film is about intimacy and how that itself is not binary but something that's achieved person to person. Elio and Oliver understood each other to the core and be it if one of them were a woman, it wouldn't have gone differently. The film itself is as Armie Hammer said, its about Love is Love is Love; and to reduce it down (not offensively) to an LGBT film doesn't do it justice, the film is about the art of love.",7rfed5
dtknhig,"You know, I normally don't enjoy LGBT movies because of that exact reason, and I hadn't thought about why I enjoyed the movie so much until I read your comment.

I loved his physicality in this role:  the shape of his torso when playing the piano (like he's constantly reminding himself to sit up straight), his romping like a puppy on his and Oliver's first night together, his slouching around in general, like someone who doesn't want to take up much space or be noticed too much.

I noticed that each time I heard/saw a fly, it was at some point where Elio was either touching himself, smelling underwear or he and Oliver were about to get sexual, which is overall why I thought they were meant to evoke the fly on the wall feeling. Knowing now that they were ultimately unintentional but left included is understandable, but I'll be paying more attention them next time I see it.",7rfed5
dswo1vp,"If I recall correctly the flies only appeared before and after Elio's relationship with Oliver.  So I took the flies to symbolize Elio's burden of having to hide his sexuality or something that.
",7rfed5

dsx3c31,"I've seen a number of thinkpieces about that, all really interesting. I love your take, as I've not heard anyone suggest that and it's really quite brilliant! I'd read the Slate article someone else linked that talks about them as a symbol of love and life's ephemerality, and I think that's onto something too. There was an interesting one that discussed the flies and blood (Elio's nosebleed, Oliver's wound) as somewhat menacing and dark symbols, perhaps representing the growing shadows around the film's time period for the protagonists, like the AIDS crisis. I dunno if I'm totally on board with that, but they talked about how the flies and Oliver's injury and I'm talking about it getting infected emphasize the physicality and kind of embodiedness the characters and their love have. Something to that maybe.

I think the flies are a testament to how powerful and interesting this movie is—even the smallest details can generate a huge amount of meaningful and interesting discussion. I'm so glad this thread was finally posted, I saw it three times in theaters and have been interested to see people's thoughts here. ",7rfed5

dsynqvp,"i don't think it should be perceived as a film about true love or soulmates or whatnot. it's a trope that we're so used to that we barely think about it, but i think the book - and the movie by extension - are relatable primarily because they're not, in my opinion, about things as grandiose as ""true love"" but rather about the mad intensity of The Crush, the obsession, the all-consuming passion of falling in love for the first time, when everything seems like the end of the world.

i'm not saying this to devalue the relationship between Elio and Oliver, at all - it clearly impacted both of their lives to a great extent, especially considering the book's ""20 years later"" ending that shows that both of them, despite having moved on with their lives, still haven't forgotten what happened between them. i just think that if it were about ""true love"", it would've been a different book and a different movie, and maybe it would've been less... real.",7rfed5

I can see what it feels like to be a member of a different gender, a different race, a different economic class, to live in a different time, to have a different belief.

Also, since the parents basically know about the relationship, calling each other by their names in the heat of the moment is one of the only secrets they share. The book further crushes the reader at the very end by having only Elio remember it. Oliver has no idea what Elio is talking about when he calls him “Elio”, which means that the relationship was much more significant to Elio than Oliver.",7rfed5

As someone who's gay, it's honestly one of the reasons this film after one viewing has frog leaped over so many to be one of my all-time favorites. This is the kind of LGBT film I want more of. The others are good, and it's important to tell those stories so people see and experience the realities some of us go through that's specific to being LGBT, but it feels really good to just have an amazing movie where the LGBT factor isn't THE story. Amazing stories are told when we get to focus on the universality of relationships between characters and the emotions shared. ",7rfed5

I thought the entire scene was beautiful but didn’t realize it was a single (or carefully edited) shot until my second viewing.

I mean he gets scenery chewing monologues, killer speeches, these big crippling moments of doubt, it's all really meaty material. But I don't know if I felt there was a ton in it where Oldman was particularly stretching himself, you know? Chalamet had to convey so much with glances, silences, these quiet moments in between, and he does it in this incredible and heartbreaking manner. Oldman crushes the big moments, sure, and he's solid when the film dips into an minor key too, but I dunno. I saw Call Me By Your Name the day after I saw Darkest Hour and it just felt like Chalamet had given a much stronger, more nuanced, and daring performance that even a month later I'm still thinking about a lot.

here are some of my points-

* It doesn't feel earned, as this great love story I mean. The two guys barely get to know each other. 
Oliver is just this objectified adonis, and Elio is horny teenager. Who's kind of loli. It doesn't feel like love, only lust. 

* Does the age difference matter to anybody? At 17 you're still basically a kid. Oliver at 24, you're an adult. Maybe a barely functioning adult but you're still an adult. Oliver is going to have more experience and emotional wherewithal, to separate and compartmentalize their affair, while Elio is basically a child. 
  
* Both men are selfish and careless with their dicks. (You know what I mean) Elio with Marzia and Oliver with Elio. Elio knew he loved Oliver when he fucked w/ Marzia. Oliver knew he had a probably fiancé to return to when he fucked Elio. Are we really supposed to root for them without reservation? 

* despite my complaints, I fucking love the sentiments behind these two moments:


*""Do you think I'm sick?""*
*""I wish everybody was as sick as you""*

And

""Call me by your name and I'll call you by mine""

It's funny that you mentioned Carol because when I was trying to figure out why the film didn't work for me, I couldn't help thinking about how breathless Carol had left me and how flat I felt after watching CMBYN.

In fact, I can't say any scene from CMBYN has actually stuck with me. I enjoyed the Sufjan songs and sadly, those were probably my favourite parts of the film. But yeah, unfortunately this is one of my biggest disappointments as well.",7rfed5

We live in an age now where graphic sex scenes have become the norm, and now I think it's more daring and exciting to *not* show them and to find other, more interesting ways to depict sex and intimacy.  Plus, as Luca Guadagnino has discussed, Elio and Oliver feel like real characters that you've slowly come to know, and watching their first time together would feel more voyeuristic than intimate and beautiful, and that's not the right tone for the film.  (Sex with Marzia didn't carry the same emotional weight, so being more explicit in those scenes didn't feel like an intrusion.)

I understand if someone felt uncomfortable about this cause they might find it weird or off-putting. No one can deny or disrespect  your personal feelings towards such a subject matter.

The fact that Charlament really looks like a kid but Hammer looks waaaaaay older than 24 might not help at all cause the age gap looks more than it is in the text.

But!

It's consensual and Charlament is the one doing the seduction so it's not predatory in the slightest. It's easily one of the best ways to handle such a relationship.

Lots of people will say ""But if made one of them a woman people would freak out cause double standards"".[An Education] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Education) was an Oscar nominated movie about a teen girl and a man twice her age played by Gevais.

There is a scene where Oliver first picks up on Elio's attraction to him, and it is when they are translating some lines of poetry back and forth from Italian to Greek to other languages. The book doesn't go into detail about the conversation, but it does mention how they started giggling about the nonsense lines and their love of word play, and it is during this early conversation that Elio blushes.

I thought this scene was much better at explaining their attraction. And the scenes in the film where they are in Bergamo and just laughing while running up the mountain or laughing while falling on the bed, I couldn't really feel their connection in those moments; I was just imagining the director saying, ""Okay, now laugh hysterically,"" but the book really goes into lots more detail about how Elio sees Oliver so it makes their connection feel deeper.

On a serious note, I agree with what you're saying in re to their ages. The scenes where Chalamet is shirtless and in shorts made me cringe. He just looks so fucking young.

For example, I'm not sure you really get to understand Oliver as a person, other than being an academic.  So, this creates a disconnect where, as a viewer, you don't know what they're feeling (more Oliver, in my opinion, than Elio).",7rfed5

The characters and their performances were all pretty great though, and it used subtle expressions very well. I didn't have as hard a time with the age difference as some people did.

Not a native speaker, I learned a new word while reading around this movie -- ""precocious"".  

Ms. Chalamet seems like a precocious young man in real life. 

As for Armie Hammer, I had only seen him once before, in The Men from U.N.C.L.E., in a completely brutal and masculine role. Here he displayed a wonderfully soft and open side to him. 

I'm as straight as they come, have a wife and five kids, and I've been thinking about this movie, and reading all kinds of stuff, for the last couple of days. It's very strange, maybe the times are so brutal and dark we are looking for more inclusiveness and tolerance. As Mr. Hammer put it, love is love, so you just need to embrace it, does not matter who your person of interest is. Or something like that.

It could have been a throwaway line in any other movie, but given their conversation near the end, that line really builds that honest, open relationship he has with his dad.

dt6kfuf,"I think it's slower on Oliver's side because in reality he *was* quite reluctant. He said multiple times that they shouldn't get into something Elio would regret. He didn't want to be that influence on him. He did give a signal or two, like the little massage during volleyball, but I think it makes sense that the older guy who's there ""on business"" with Elio's dad would be a little bit reluctant to show his feelings until he was 100% positive that Elio also had a thing for him. It could otherwise come across a bit predatory, or he could lose this academic opportunity in case he was misreading Elio and Elio was to freak out if he made advances.",7rfed5

dt1p0d4,"Yes, this exactly. I remember a scene in the book quite well where Elio was going on about whether he wanted Oliver, or wanted to BE Oliver. I’ll see if I can find it and post here when I do.

Edit: here’s one quote (I know there are others, too, and will keep looking):

>Perhaps the physical and the metaphorical meanings are clumsy ways of understanding what happens when two beings need, not just to be close together, but to become so totally ductile that each becomes the other. To be who I am because of you. To be who he was because of me.

And here is the section where the CMBYN quote appears:

>The dream had been right—this was like coming home, like asking, Where have I been all my life? which was another way of asking, Where were you in my childhood, Oliver? which was yet another way of asking, What is life without this? which was why, in the end, it was I, and not he, who blurted out, not once, but many, many times, You’ll kill me if you stop, you’ll kill me if you stop, because it was also my way of bringing full circle the dream and the fantasy, me and him, the longed-for words from his mouth to my mouth back into his mouth, swapping words from mouth to mouth, which was when I must have begun using obscenities that he repeated after me, softly at first, till he said, “Call me by your name and I’ll call you by mine,” which I’d never done in my life before and which, as soon as I said my own name as though it were his, took me to a realm I never shared with anyone in my life before, or since.

And yet another quote that applies:

>It would finally dawn on us both that he was more me than I had ever been myself, because when he became me and I became him in bed so many years ago, he was and would forever remain, long after every forked road in life had done its work, my brother, my friend, my father, my son, my husband, my lover, myself.

And I'm just going to continue editing this post as I find new things, because this topic has stuck in my heart for well over a month since first seeing the film. Here is a quote from a recent Q&amp;A Andre Aciman (the novel's author) did, explaining precisely where the title line came from:

>Fan Question: What did you intend with the phrase, ‘Call me by your name, I’ll call you by mine.’ Because I know it speaks about their intimacy and how they love each other so much that they not only saw each other in one another, but they saw each other as themselves. Did you intend for it to have any other meaning besides that?

>Aciman: No, that was exactly the meaning that I wanted. In other words, you are me and I am you, and at this point you can even take my name. I don’t know where I am and where we begin or end. There should not be a beginning and an end. It was the ultimate form of, what I call, identity- abductivity, by osmosis you become the other person.

Final edit (maybe?): it took two readings and five listens (I’m a sucker for Armie’s voice), but I finally found the quote that I was thinking of when I first posted this. Better late than never...

> Did I want to be like him? Did I want to be him? Or did I just want to have him? Or are “being” and “having” thoroughly inaccurate verbs in the twisted skein of desire, where having someone’s body to touch and being that someone we’re longing to touch are one and the same, just opposite banks on a river that passes from us to them, back to us and over to them again in this perpetual circuit where the chambers of the heart, like the trapdoors of desire, and the wormholes of time, and the false-bottomed drawer we call identity share a beguiling logic according to which the shortest distance between real life and the life unlived, between who we are and what we want, is a twisted staircase designed with the impish cruelty of M. C. Escher. When had they separated us, you and me, Oliver? And why did I know it, and why didn’t you? Is it your body that I want when I think of lying next to it every night or do I want to slip into it and own it as if it were my own, as I did when I put on your bathing suit and took it off again, all the while craving, as I craved nothing more in my life that afternoon, to feel you slip inside me as if my entire body were your bathing suit, your home? You in me, me in you…",7rfed5

However, you can't help but notice it when the relationship is put in movie form. Michael Stuhlbarg never even seems uncomfortable with the idea of his son and this older man have a relationship.

Well, clearly I and many others are questioning that. Chalamet was very good, but Gary Oldman's performance was essential to Darkest Hour's success.

They ride away from the camera, and the camera just stays on the same shot for a long time, so you see them disappear in the distance. It felt like a very self-conscious shot to me. I could imagine Luca being quite proud of himself b/c of how long the shot lingered and because we don't often see such long, wide shots without much action. On the other hand, there were several other scenes where I thought they cut away too quickly after the action. All of these sort of departures from more ""traditional"" filmmaking distracted me.

If it had then it could have had the potential to fuck up someone's life(*), but since that didn't happen I'd say we're projecting too much. 

However, I have seen too many relationships between people of very similar ages, that did not have the right power dynamics. Relationships where one of the partners always gets the short end of the stick, but you can't say anything since if you do they'll blame you forever for ruining their lives. So, I guess it all depends on the context.

(*): In the film. The second part of the book kinda deals with that consequences of their short relationship.",7rfed5

Dating is no better; I'd argue it's actually worse because there's less people to choose from and find a match.

But if you come from a small town that is more conservative it gets way worse even today. A lot of people stay closeted even know because of fear of being socially ostracized by friends and family. I can't imagine how bad it is in most Asian / Middle Eastern countries. Good luck running around looking for dates and hookups there!

For me - without going off the deep end with my thoughts - Elio’s father is expressing the value of what Elio and Oliver had and simultaneously validating it. True love needs validation, particularly when you’ve been supremely vulnerable and given all of yourself to someone you love... So when it ends you feel like it was the universe/nature deceiving you. You begin to believe and convince yourself that your feelings are detrimental and futile. His father is parenting him to save and harness the emotions...good and bad. 

This film really has scorned me raw. I had never read the book. I’ve always been an Oscar enthusiast and typically watch most of the nominated films before the ceremony. This film, though, has struck a cord...and rattled my mind. 

 I’m turning 28 in a few weeks and the scene with the father was like being smacked in the face; I feel awoken now to emotions I thought I had suppressed to oblivion. I had been learning the mastery of suppressed feelings. I was almost at peak numb, and now I’m second guessing it all.

The Academy unfortunately thinks LGBT+ is a genre (which is absurd), and it rarely awards two films of the same genre in a row (the only times in the last 50 years that I can think of are when Shakespeare in Love won right after Titanic and The Godfather, The Sting, and The Godfather Part II all won right after the other).",7rfed5

Most people don't stay for the credits, so leaving something to happen during the credits without telling the audience it is happening will result in that something being ignored.

Marvel keeps people in the movie for the post credits scenes because people want to be in on the game and one up whoever missed it.

Usually those scenes are spoiled beforehand and now they're very much expected, so people will stay even if there's no scene.

With CMBYN no one said ""Oh yeah, there's a brilliant scene with Timothée during the credits, you should stay seated"" so people who didn't look for that extra completely missed it. ",7rfed5

dswwpda,"Yes, but the movie intentionally portrays the mother to have a much more prominent role with Elio. In the book she plays no emotionally supportive role about his love interests, but in the movie they change it so she does. She reads him the passage about the Knight ""to speak or to die"" and such which motivates him to tell his feelings to Oliver and she talks to him about his ""friendship"" with Oliver. Then of course she picks him up from the train station in Bergamo and consoles him when he is obviously crying of a broken heart. None of that happens in the book so they definitely change her role in the movie from a passive one to an active one.
It's true that in the book that when he says ""does mom know?"" that he means does she know about Oliver and I, but I am sure that in the movie they meant it to mean ""does mom know how you really feel about her and have you admitted to her that you loved another more?"".",7rfed5

They wouldn't freak out if they just processed it as a positive. You can easily reverse that. You freak out over fucking up a piece of film enough to need a reshoot

I saw the film again yesterday and the scene I'm talking about has an effect similar to a light leak. Part of the film has a blue-gray blob all over it because light got into the film as they were putting the chemicals to it or opening it. There's literally film spokes on screen.

They'll hand them out right before you get your seat, just so there is no confusion at all.... do you see how silly that is? Not everyone reads the synopsis before seeing a film. The two actors to me, and other people, looked to have a huge age gap between them, and it made me uncomfortable. It impeded my enjoyment of the film. 

It's not the same says judging the moral compass of a movie like Goodfellas, because goodfellas isn't glorifying murder in the slightest. This depicts the love between someone who looks like a boy, and someone who looks like a full grown man. That's what I had an issue with. ",7rfed5

dtkj8s6,"So maybe we should clarify, since I responded to several people when I made this comment. IN the movie, Hammer's character, who is 24, seduces and has sex with the 17 year old.  In many places in the US that would be illegal, or rape, or at the minimum sex with a minor. A commentor said that in the setting in the movie the age of consent was 14 so no crime was committed. 

My larger point refers to the twitter fight between Hammer and James Woods. James Woods said that this movie erodes the public decency and promotes NAMBLA. Hammer responded by asking Hadn't woods dated a 19 year old?   My point was that 19 is LEGAL in all 50 states. 17 is not. big difference.   Your point seems to be that 17 is fine because it's close to 18. But I say if we erase the line at 17 because YOU think so, then why not erase it completely to 14 ? But you seem to think, for some reason, that 14 is a line but 17 isn't. I'm only asking you why.  And I'm getting to the heart of this issue. That this film as well as Louis CKs film ""I Love You Daddy"", is asking. Why do we have these arbitrary lines? ",7rfed5
dv59e8d,Manchester by the sea was emotionally draining that I honestly don't want to watch it a second time. Have fun at Shape of the Water tho! ,7rfed5
dtlbbax,"First of all, Hammer’s character doesn’t seduce Chalamet’s. Chalamet is the aggressor in the relationship and is the one who is constantly pursuing Hammer. And Hammer’s character exerts no influence in Chalamet’s life whatsoever since he is not his teacher or anything and they’re characters are both presented as mature and intellectual.

17 is legal in other countries, and surprise, not everything revolves around American laws or ideals. And actually, only 11 states in the United States have the age of consent at 18. As someone who was 17 at one point, I was no different when I was 18. 14 and 17 are totally different ages. And Hammer pointed out the hypocrisy of people like James Wood who aren’t considered when there’s large age gaps between heterosexual people. Movies like An Education, The Diary of a Teenage Girl, Dirty Dancing, Summer of 42, The Constant Nymph, The Reader, and Singing in the Rain have much larger age gaps but there’s no controversy there. I have not seen I Love You Daddy or was aware there was a relationship in there, so I can’t comment on that.",7rfed5
dtljfnw,"1. It's irrelevant which character pursue's the other. If Hammer's character CHOSE to have sex then the responsibility is on him. That's like saying that a student pursued a teacher, so the teacher isn't responsible for the inappropriate encounter. 

2. 17 and a student could be in high school. 24 and a person could be a teacher in the same High school. You'd be fine with that relationship? 

3. Under the LAW , 14 and 17 are exactly the same, both legal to have sex with a 24 year old.  So i'm not sure you're making a good point there. The Law disagree's with you.

4. I don't agree with An Education where she was 17 at the time of sex. Diary of Teenage girl she was 15. Dirty Dancing she was 17. Summer of 42 she's 15. Constant Nymph the age is ""teen"". And The Reader he is 15. Singing in the Rain there isn't sex.  But you bring up great examples of how Hollywood erodes morality by giving examples of inappropriate sexual relationships. 

I love you daddy, she is 17 and he is 70. 

Finally, here is my point.  I have no problem with accepting that adults can have sex with teenagers. If you accept it as well. You have to admit that a 24 year old or a 36 year old or a 70 year old is perfectly fine having sex with a 17 year old or a 14 year old. 

You can't denounce an arbitrary line like 17/18 and then draw your own arbitrary line at 14. 

Hammer wasn't pointing out some hetero/homo hypocrisy. He was trying to point out a young/old thing. But it didn't work because she was 19, legal in ALL 50 states and all over the world. 17 is not the same case. 

",7rfed5
dtra21h,"1. But Hammer's character isn't his teacher, which was my point. There was no imbalance of power between them since Hammer had no control over Chalamet's character. They were presented as equals. 

2. No I wouldn't be fine with that. But that's not what happens in the movie. And context is what matters since there is no imbalance of power and Elio and Oliver are presented as equals on an intellectual and maturity level.

3. Under the law, 39 of the 50 states in the United States have its age consent lower than 18. And many countries all over the world, especially in Europe have an age of consent lower than 18.

4. I don't know the context of I Love You Daddy's relationship, but the age gap is much more problematic than the actual age of the girl. Which is what is problematic in James Woods' case as Hammer contended. Many people like Woods have claimed that the film is immoral for the age gap (hypocritical in Woods case) and/or the age of Chalamet's character, which is strange since most of them remained silent when those heterosexual Hollywood films I mentioned were released, or because the film simply revolves around a gay romance, but that'

>  You can't denounce an arbitrary line like 17/18 and then draw your own arbitrary line at 14.

Yes, you can because someone who is 14 is less mature/developed than someone who is 17/18 and is obviously much younger lol. ",7rfed5
dtryay8,"1. Hammer is 24, an ADULT. That's the balance. 

2. Not by age level. Which is the objective metric. ""intellectual"" equals is some vague judgemental notion made subjectively by each individual. 

3. US Federal law puts the age of consent at 12. I'm not sure what you're arguing here. You seem to be arguing against your previous claim that lawful age of consent is irrelevant because 14 is ""too young"". But now you're using the under 18 argument to defend sex with a minor. So again, which is? Is the age of consent the hard line in the sand? If so, then 12 or 14 or 15 is perfectly fine with you having sex with a 24 years, just as 17 is....

4. You have also drawn an arbitrary ""age gap"" in your mind with the I Love You Daddy reference as well as the James Woods gap. Woods has no problem in defense because she was 19. Legal in the entire world. Hammer has issues because 17 is not globally legal. Regardless of the hypocrisy of homo/hetero.  Which I agree with. The issue isn't homo/hetero. It's whether you are ok with grown adults which 24 is, and also 70 is, having sexual relations with non adults (under 18).  But you keep trying to draw the line between 17 and 14, or 18 and 17. Why? Those lines are SO arbitrary and individual that the law can't begin to address them.  

Are you arguing that the age of consent should be lowered in 50 states to 14? What age do YOU think is good age to lower it to? Because you just argued that 17 is too high. 

So should 16 year olds be able to have sex with 18 year olds but not 50 year old men?  Is your issue the age gap? and why can't you see that if so, it undermines your argument. ",7rfed5
