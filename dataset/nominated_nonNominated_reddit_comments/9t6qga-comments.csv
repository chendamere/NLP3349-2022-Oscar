e8yxgk7,"Jesus christ, Olga's torture scene felt like it went on for 10 minutes it WAS SO DAMN LONG. Everyone in my theater was so uncomfortable and clenching every muscle, I loved it!",9t6qga
e92y4ev,"I have a theory. Interested in other's opinions.

\-

The witches believed that Helena Markos was Mother Suspiriorum.

Because of this, they performed a ritual with the ultimate goal being to insert the spirit of Suspiriorum in Susie's body. Obviously, they expected it would be Markos' spirit entering Susie's body, but they were wrong.

Instead, the ritual succeeded, but rather than it being an instantaneous transfer, the spirit of Suspiriorum was retroactively inserted into Susie's body at birth, lying dormant.

As Susie grew up, she had an unexplainable pull towards Berlin, towards dance (specifically Volk), towards the School. Even her birth mother sensed that something was not right with her daughter. She sensed that there was something lurking inside her - something not Christian, something sinful.

Susie continued to age, obsessing over Berlin and the dance academy until finally, she decided to go.

While at the School, Susie began to sense something - someone - inside of her. The magic and ritual taking place around her (and to her) started to awaken Mother Suspiriorum's spirit. Several times, Susie mentioned that she felt someone was with her, or inside of her.

After some wild, vivid nightmares, Susie awakened in the dead of night screaming 'I know who I am!""

From this moment onwards, she became sure of herself. She started speaking with Madame Blanc telepathically and was becoming more and more in tune with the occult.

Finally, at the black mass, she was given the final chance to go back and have her memory erased (Madame Blanc even said this to her), but she chose to move forward with the ritual and fully awaken Mother Suspiriorum inside of her. Until this point, the spirit (or soul) of Susie and the spirit of Mother Suspiriorum were both inhabiting her body simultaneously.

In order for the ritual to be complete, Susie had to embrace one mother and abandon the other. She chose to reject her birth mother, and in doing so she literally gave her soul to Mother Suspiriorum.

Subsequently, Mother Suspiriorum was the dominant spirit (perhaps the only spirit) inside of Susie's body. The ritual was complete.

To seal the deal, Mother Suspiriorum killed all the false mothers that remained. (""Death to all other mothers!"") This included retroactively killing Susie's birth mother, as well as killing all the witches in the coven that were idolising Markos instead of her.",9t6qga

Oh",9t6qga
e955m7x,"There is a conversation between Suzie and Blanc about the jumping, Suzie's instincts telling her to stay on the ground.  Blanc demands the jumps, accusing Suzie of ""confusing weakness for artistic preference."" Suzie makes an argument that by staying low through the performance that the sudden contrast when she jumps at the end will have much more impact. Am I crazy to think this relates very closely to filmmakers choice of an autumnal, muted color palette, ci tasting g so much from the original also famous vibrancy? The controlledd, muted and long shots five way to the bright red stuttered nightmare of the ritual and it is indeed a jarring break.",9t6qga

And in regards to the first half of my post, because of that scene and a couple of others, do the other dancers know what’s going on there?",9t6qga
e9gtngy,"Saw this the other night. I really liked the original Suspiria and I knew this was an entirely different movie so I went in with an open mind. I love the slow burn of this movie, made me want to pay attention to every detail. A lot of comments here give me the idea that the music by Yorke was polarizing and unfitting, especially in the climax. I personally find Radiohead irritating but I really liked the music here, I found it very engaging especially in the climax. 

The scene with Olga getting totally bent out of shape (understatement) was really well done and horrific, it was this scene that made me afraid that the movie was going to be 2 hours of a ridiculous male fantasy that feels girls getting tortured is somehow deep or edgy, but my fears were dispelled later on. 

The Act 6 climax is totally bonkers and unreal which is what I was hoping to see. A complaint I see is that it looked a little cheesy with the blood effects, and I agree. A little complaint I have is the blocking in this scene: Markos is there, watching over the ritual as Suzie steps in. But I felt really bothered that despite being the top matriarch in the coven, Markos was just kinda like, smooshed into the corner of the scene. I feel like, stylistically, she should have been on some kind of throne or SOMETHING to center her in the scene. This was done quite well with Suzie being revealed as Mother Suspiriorum, but when her spectre of Death comes out and kills Markos, the shots and blocking are really kind of awkward. Like, Death has this totally creepy reveal, but she struts up to Markos who is still in this dumb little corner of the room. Then Death's back is to the camera, and I don't really know how to explain but the positioning of the characters here really bothered me. Felt really awkward. 

That was long winded. I really liked the movie overall though and might see it again! Slight detail: Suzie's mother has heavy, labored breathing and I was reminded of how Markos in the original Suspiria film also had heavy breathing while she slept. Maybe that was a purposeful thing this film did to try and connect Markos to Suzie's mother? Just an interesting little detail that some might pick up. Or maybe I'm wrong, haha.",9t6qga
e9oov5u,"I don’t get the middling reception on Rotten Tomatoes. This is one of the best films of the year in my opinion, and is a perfect companion piece to the original. Where the original was primarily an experience on a sensory level, this film added much more substance, and played more viscerally with the perverted fairy tale like atmosphere of the story. I’m really excited to see the film again.",9t6qga

Using his distinct style to transport the audience to the atmosphere of his movie once again, Luca left us in a dark, cold, and brutal Germany only to add to that chilling finale act. I would say this surpasses the original in term of theme and story line. ",9t6qga

e92jxi3,"In the original, Markos is Mother Suspiriorum and is killed by Susie. In this version, Susie is Mother Suspiriorum and survives the film. The film also deliberately mentions the other two Mothers. Hopefully there's more planned for this franchise! 

The climax of *Inferno*, the 2nd in Argento's original trilogy, bears a strong similarity to the climax in this film in regard to the appearance of ""Death Personified"". Looks like Guadagnino did his homework when studying the Argento films. ",9t6qga
e8yehwc,"There's a lot here to like. Tilda is MVP as she always is, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the dance sequences are electric. Luca did an incredible job of maintaining an unsettling atmosphere the whole way through without resorting to cheap tricks. 

But it's also somewhat overlong, and maybe treads the line between ""intentionally mysterious"" and ""unintentionally incomprehensible"" a bit too closely. I'm unsure yet if the positives outweigh the negatives - I couldn't stop mulling it over on the drive home, though, which is usually a good sign. 

I liked Thom Yorke's score less than I was hoping to, and enjoyed Dakota Johnson more than I was expecting to. Usually I find her blank, but here Luca was able to make that quality read as inscrutable. She should play characters like this more often. ",9t6qga
e9ldqn5,"I love how the director kept the campy horror movie pan shots and the cheesy blood and whatnot and still managed to maintain the unsettling vibe.

I'll also go against the grain and say that I LOVE the music, and think it was done well. Thom's familiar warm voice was like something holding me down from being so on edge about the gore (I also watched this in an empty theater at midnight, so I may have been more scared than most :P). He also wrote the other music for the movie (eg. title track and volk) which are undoubtedly on-tone.",9t6qga
e9a0y0y,"Hey friends, just got back from seeing Suspiria for the third time and wanted to share some wild little details I finally picked up and haven't seen anyone else notice yet.  


1. At the very beginning, the patient Dr. Klemperer shows in to his office after Patricia leaves is named Mr. Berger. In ""A Sliced Pear,"" Suspiria tells Klemperer the man who killed his wife at the concentration camp was named Mr. Berger


2. In the final shot as it zooms in on the heart carving, a passerby calls to their friend (in German, with no subtitles) ""Come on, Lutz."" Lutz is the name of the man who plays Klemperer (whom Tilda Swinton plays)


3. At the Volk performance, it is Blanc possessing Sarah to make her dance. You can tell because, among other things, Sarah's eyes are replaced with Blanc's (I've seen this mentioned, except people mistakenly say Sarah and Susie change eye colors. No, Susie's remain the same, and you can see short shota of Blanc performing the movements on the side). Coolest thing about this insight is rewatching the scene as Blanc dancing with Susie through Sarah's body, having that intimate moment, and Susie is definitely aware of it. EDIT: I was mistaken, Susie's eyes DO change. But my point about it being Blanc dancing still stands


4. Madam Tanner has a purse around her neck in one of the rehearsals, which she strokes absentmindedly. It appears to be made of black hair if you look closely...


5. As Klemperer leaves the police office, but turns to thank the officer for his help with his search for Anke, the officer grabs/readjusts his balls.


6. Hard to state this succinctly, I have said more about it in other comments on here, but essentially the witches are communicating telepathically and seeing through walls into other rooms the entire movie, and you probably didn't realize on a first watch through because your brain explains it as film conventions. It's only once you know the witches can do this, after the Blanc and Susie telepathy scene, that you would notice it's been going on right in front of us the whole time.


7. Second time at the Paris cafe, look above and behind Blanc's head, on the wall. There's just this rubber arm on a spring bouncing up and down the whole time. It's really creepy but also hilarious? I couldn't help it, i laughed out loud when I saw it, very awkward in a theater of people who with good reason weren't checking out the wall decore in that sexy stare down scene.


8. Fun to pay more attention to on multiple watches: suicidal witch's character progression (you can start to get a pretty clear sense why she kills herself), foreshadowing of Susie being Suspiria in just some of the little things she says and even her way of saying things-- totally confident and at home, all the less prominent witches (each actually has a distinctive character built up through the course of the film, and you can see the hierarchy even if you didn't have Patricia's drawing to lay it out)


That's all I got from memory without my notes in front of me, but if anyone else is as rabidly in love with this film and wants to go over details and analysis hit me up!",9t6qga
e9jdxfl,"I saw the movie last night, and I can't really get it out of my mind. I'm torn between my love for certain sections on the film, and my severe distastes for other parts...   
 
**Things I loved:**  
 
Volk:  
 
The dance scene was by far, the most engrossing part of the movie. The choreography was fantastic, all of the movements were so raw and beautiful at the same time--contrary to Madame Blanc's insistance on dance *not* being beautiful. Moreover, the cinematography in the scene--specifically the overhead shots--were sublime. Those shots--and the alternate angles in general--added to the ritualistic/fantastique nature of the dance, I loved it. Kudos to Dakota Johnson and Mia Goth here, so captivating. And shout out to Thom Yorke--'*Volk*' was the perfect companion to the scene. The synths reminded me of Morton Subotnik's *Silver Apples Of The Moon* and I think that was a conscious choice on Thom's behalf, in that like Subotnik's work, *Volk* is alien, supernatural, and beautifully atmospheric. So great. A perfect scene. Definitely the highlight of the film for me. 

Acts II - V:  

I dunno about the whole 6 act structure + epilogue, but that's beside the point. From acts II - V I was completely glued to my seat. This is the core of the movie, and in it you'll find all of it's best parts. Aside from the Volk scene mentioned, another that sticks out as many others have liked to point out is Olga's torture. Super gruesome, and it wouldn't let you look away. Loved it. Another--when Sara explores the Witch's hideout. The lack of sound and feeling of impending doom kept me on edge. The camera movements reminded me a lot of David Lynch's *Mulholland Drive*, especially how the camera cautiously and slowly approached each corner.. Definitely made it the most frightening part of the film for me. Speaking of David Lynch, the dream sequences were phenomenal. Very reminscent of the horror films of the early 2000s--think of *The Ring*--with the quick cuts, brief moments of violence, and confusion they create.. The scene where the witches toy with the men is also a point of intrigue. True black comedy in that it is funny and terrifying at the same time. If only the rest of the film kept this balance... 
 
**This that I enjoyed:**     
 
The Acting:   
 
Stellar performances from Dakota Johnson, Mia Goth, Tilda Swinton, Angela Winkler, and most of the supporting cast. Chloe Grace Moretz on the other hand, is one of the most unforgivable aspects of the movie, and a complete miscast. There is absolutely no need to use a big name actor--let alone one who is poor at acting--for the role of Patricia. Double whamy of distraction. She's the single reason why the acting is part of the things I loved about the movie.   
  
 Cinematography:  
  
While it wasn't the most original, it was interesting enough to captivate. Subtle little things like adding a slight shake to the Kubrickian zooms were intriguing, and let the audience know that the film is aware of horror tropes, and is gonna mess around with those...     
  
**The bad:** 
 
The Score:  

The fault doesn't necessarily lie with the score--albeit it isn't *that* exciting--but rather how it was used. Anytime Thom--who leads one of the world's most popular bands for Christ's sake--sang, was sooo distracting. Using *Unmade* in the climax of the film is such a poor, poor choice. Especially in a scene that is already skewered by poor choices. I really don't understand how Guadagnino thought Thom's song and voice could be anything but a distraction.. Some have said that it made the scene tragic, and surely it might have, if the scene wasn't so stupidely over the top. If the scene had any sort of seriousness then maybe it would've worked... But it didn't. Not for me at least... And it plays right into the biggest flaw of the film: Tone.   
  
The Tone:  
 

This is my biggest gripe with the film. I think this is most evident with the climax of the film. Mother Markos, while presumably frightening to some, looked like nothing more than a slightly spookier version of Jabba the Hut. Not only did people in my theatre laugh each time she spoke, but they also chuckled during parts of the execution of the witches loyal to Markos. Truthfully, I do not blame them. How could you view that scene as anything but goofy? The CGI blood fest was far too over the top. Instead of evoking a sense of doom and disgust, I couldn't help but get angry at how silly it seemed. Perhaps the fault is in showing the gore and *not* leaving it up to the imagination? A sort of double-edged sword where I would be complaining if I didn't see enough blood? Maybe a singular, quick shot of the grotesque violence would have sufficied in making it terrifying? I dunno, it just really rubbed me the wrong way... After the scene, the first line we hear from one of the dancers is along the lines of ""Last night was crazy, I had way too much to drink"", which is comical/absurd, and could've have been sooooo God damn disturbing if the scene before it was so... But no. Similarly, the scene following the madness where Suzie/Suspirium goes to the old man's house... My goodness, where to start. Not only did his whole storyline drag the movie, but they had to finish him! Gosh, the monologue was so melodramatic, so cheesy! The deliberate juxtaposition of horror/serious drama and comedy can work--they do well in the cop scene mentioned above--but Guadagnino absolutely fails here. One moment we are greeted with a witch singing absurdly--as if she were in a JG Wentworth commerical--to prosthetic Jabba the Hut, to CGI'd head explosions, to Tilda Swinton's decapitation becoming a gag, to a soapy monologue about the death of one's lost lover... Muddled. Muddled, unsure, and deeply frustrating are the only words I have to describe this end... It's such a shame too, given how much a deeply enjoyed most of the film. In this way I think it pisses me off even more, because I know that the film COULD HAVE been a masterpiece, but it isn't, and it misses the mark completely...  
  
**Overall:**  
 
I really want to love the film. And at times I definitely did. But the errors in tone really take away from it, and the bottom line is that those errors practically zap away any chance that the film has at being a masterpiece.    
 
**75/100**  
  
Thoughts on my thoughts? ",9t6qga
e8yj0av,If Alamo Drafthouse had balls they would offer a Suspiria Pretzel for the film and then bring it out right after the Olga contortions scene.,9t6qga
e9uq8wi,"Did you notice... The importance of mirrors in Suspiria is pretty obvious, but I have a theory that mirrors are used as a metaphor for Suzy's knowledge of the coven. The first obvious use of this imagery is when Suzy first enters the lobby of the dance school. The camera whip pans and lifts to show a wide shot of the lobby opposite the high window of the office. In a later shot we see Blanc (Tilda) is observing through a two-way mirror that is directly opposite the high reception window we saw earlier, exactly where the camera moved to in the earlier shot. Showing us that Blanc was watching from the moment she entered. At this point, Suzy has no idea about the Coven. Mirrors are then used consistently as objects of misdirection and general visual confusion. UNTIL. Skip forward to the first montage scene where the girls are sleeping and we're given the eery long shots of the farm and horrific close ups of gory things. The last scene of this montage is slow motion footage of a mirror dropping on the floor and shattering, marking the point at which the veil Blanc is keeping over the coven starts to lift.

It is in the very next dancing scene that Blanc requests the mirrors in the studio are covered (no longer requiring the illusion as she wants Suzy to get closer to the coven). She also mentions that this is Suzy's 'rebirth' further marking this section of the film as the turning point in her understanding of the true plot. It is at this point Suzy begins feeling the dance more and even suggests a different way of doing things, saying she wants to be grounded. (Possibly due to Markos's presence below?)

Just a thought :)

(Bonus theory part - unsure about this though)
At the end, when Suzy/Suspiriorum visits the Doctor, we see a small oval mirror hanging on the wall to the top right of his bed. The mirror is cracked. This could represent the fact he now is also fully aware of the coven and that veil has been shattered. Yet once Suzy clears his memory, we get a low shot from the bed with both of them in frame, and just in the top of the frame is that mirror which (confirmation needed) no longer looks cracked. Thus showing us the veil is back in place, and the coven is once again secret.

This film was only released today in the UK and in limited cinemas. SO glad to have seen it, what an experience!",9t6qga

e8yd1fw,"This movie had me shook. It's so precise and the imagery, especially in the dreams, is harrowing. 

Hard to talk about the plot. There's bits of it they told us several times and bits we never get explained. I'm going to have to see it again for sure to think about the actual chain of events a bit but even on a first watch it was tense and interesting enough that I was never bored even though it is almost three hours.

The first death scene where Olga was being contorted really fucked me up. And it seemed like it went on for so long. Then finally when it was over the coven comes over and shoves hooks all over her body. Frightening stuff. 

It may not come through in this review but I really enjoyed this. Can't wait to see it again but it's a really impressive film. 8/10.",9t6qga
e8zzkak,"This was my most anticipated movie of the year but the finale left me a bit disappointed. The rest of the movie was a 10/10 but the climax feels like it didn't live up to the rest of it, namely Markos' cheesy look/dialogue, and the combination of the awful low frame rate effect and handheld camera, it made it feel super amateurish and bad compared to the rest of the film",9t6qga
e8yo870,So this movie was definitely a warning of fascism repeating itself right?,9t6qga
e9syrid,"Absolutely loved it, one of my favourites of the year. Movies like this are why I love going to see films. It's just great filmmaking all around with great performances, great music (I love Guadagnino's use of songs with lyrics here, like in CMBYN), it's beautifully shot and nearly everything works. I loved how gory and visceral it all was.

It reminded me a lot of a Kubrick film as I watched it, almost like a hybrid of the tone and slow burn of the Shining and the setting and set design of a Clockwork Orange. It also had lots of shots that reminded me of Kubrick, with slow zooms and one point perspective shots used throughout.

Yeah I loved it, highly recommend it to everyone unless you hate gore. Only had very minor quibbles that don't matter overall ",9t6qga

e8ydljo,"While it's phenomenal on a craft level with some of the best production design and cinematography of the year, along with a cold and brooding score that fits the tone well, I just can't get behind a movie where the first hour felt like such a tedious exercise. The film is thematically extremely dense-the strongest for me is how the old generation currently in power try to maintain it by abusing the young, having them cannibalize themselves for the benefit of the old until the young finally do rise up when they have nothing left to lose-but it meanders too much for me to fully get behind it. A couple of other thoughts:

-This is a film that I don't think any sane person can fully unpack in a single viewing. On one hand, this is a credit to its thematic complexity; on the other hand, I just can't see myself sitting down and watching all 152 minutes of it again to fully digest it

-It's felt like a meh last two years for Tilda Swinton...until Suspiria. She's terrific in her performance(s)

-I would put money on Suspiria getting a D Cinemascore at best and it doing poorly at the box office",9t6qga

e92n0xn,"The horror sequences in the movie were some of the most visceral and brutal I have seen in some time. Unfortunately, the movie has way too much drama and backstory which muddles the story. The languid pacing did not help either. It is hard to call this a failure since the director worked so hard not to ape Argento (which would have been a colossal mistake) but his desire to elevate this from a fantasy horror to something more profound was not a complete success. It needed to lose at least half an hour to be more concise and powerful.",9t6qga
e9gf27i,"I liked the film quite a bit, so many scenes and images are going to stick with me.  It feels like this fever dream i had and its like I can't really say what was real and what wasn't. 

I've seen some people talk about finding the Klemperer storyline redundant or slow. I really liked his scenes, and how they weaved into the narrative was interesting. I think for me it helped ground the film.  He was sort of a regular, mortal human who fell into this impossible hellscape.

After one viewing, I think one of my only complaints is that the final scene felt a little bit inelegant. The monstrous makeup, the insanely ridiculous violence, some weird camera angles and CGI. I just felt that it wasn't as effective as the first 5 chapters. 

All in all though, an intensely ambitious piece and I have never seen anything like it.

eea4gq7,"Watched last night and loved it, really don't agree with the length/pacing complaints, it's like everytime there's a film (that isn't Marvel's) that is 2h30 everyone will say it's overlong even when the length is justified. I'm not sure yet how I feel about the war/terrorism background and the themes regarding that and the CG and music during the climax wasn't great... but at the same time they kinda added even more uneasiness to that sequence, I'll be sure on rewatches.  
Everything else though? Fantastic. It actually made me think much more of Possession (1981) than the original Suspiria and just like Possession it's a rare film that actually made me feel weird and disturbed a little.  
Obvious praise to the cinematography (easily the best shot film of the year), the score and Tilda Swinton, but I also thought Dakota Johnson was fantastic, all the setpieces were great and inventive, the dancing was really good and the editing was insane.

Really took me out of it altogether. It's a shame because otherwise it was great. Great 70s-style cinematography and aesthetic, shot on 35mm and wonderful acting and choreography.

That being said as soon as they mentioned the Three Mothers I sorta pieced together that Suzy was Mother Suspirium or was going to be or always was etc. Also the silhouette of Suzy's dresses throughout the film all had a very matronly 1950s American housewife shape. Definitely as a result of her Mennonite upbringing but it made me wonder if it was done to hint at her true being.

Finally, the final act with Suzy opening her chest reminds me  of the Catholic Mother Mary specifically the depictions of  Our Lady of Guadalupe with her burning heart. 

The only thing I wished was one of the other girls (Patricia, olga, or Sarah) would have asked to live. Part of me thinks they wanted to and Suspirium was powerful enough to convince them otherwise, or maybe she is a merciful Mother.",9t6qga

e8ybzua,"What a brutal movie. It’s been a while since a horror movie actually made me wince and cringe in my seat. Olga’s death in the beginning definitely did that for me. 

In terms of remakes I could compare this to 1982’s The Thing or 1983’ Scarface as it’s less of a scene-for-scene remake of the original and more of a re-imagining or re-interpretation of its source material. If I remember correctly, the director did mention that his version is essentially like a cover of the original which makes sense. 

It seems to be the complete opposite of Dario Argento’s film in every way from having a more muted color palette, featuring more dancing and having a much more complex story as well. I did enjoy the scenes of the witches or “mothers” voting and just meeting together to talk about issues in the academy. 

I did think that Thom Yorke’s soundtrack isn’t nearly as memorable or original as the original score by Goblin but it does a good job. I’d also like to commend the cinematography from the various zooms and closeups it felt like a movie made during the 1970s. 

Overall I felt that I liked the original just a bit more for its simplicity and the gorgeous lighting and atmosphere, but I thoroughly enjoyed the remake for what it was and how it complements the original. 

One cool thing I found out was that Anke, the wife of the Doctor is played by Jessica Harper, who plays Susie Bannion. I’d assume she’d have a bigger role in the remake but I guess not. ",9t6qga

ee1mn1r,"Damn. This was a good movie bordering on greatness. Kind of blew my mind because i expected another ""product"" devoid of artistic soul put forth more as a product by the suits to cash in. It wasn't that.

Tilda Swinton should just take over the horror movie genre she's that good in horror.

Bravo to Dakota Johnson's performance.

Getting Thom Yorke on this was a stroke of genius. Thom combined with and merging into the atmosphere of this movie. Wow.

The dancing, music, atmosphere was mesmerizing.

When i was commenting in the Halloween 2018 thread about being disappointed with it's atmosphere or more  accurately lack thereof... this movie's atmosphere is what i wanted. If this movie was Halloween with Michael Myers creeping around in the back i think i'd about have a panic attack.

I liked it. Definitely a keeper worthy of a re-watch or two.

e8yexrg,"Not an easy movie to watch - however after having thought a lot about it I think it’s an objectively good film.

One thing that was refreshing is that the evil actually “made mistakes” in the movie - a lot of times horror movies will have evil be all powerful and flawless, etc. The fact that these incredibly powerful witches still had discussions about what was the correct way to do things was something new to see. 

Also the score was incredible, along with the cinematography. Especially in the dancing scenes: instead of beautiful sweeping shots of the dancing, the almost documentary esque shots made for a very unsettling effect. 

The sound design was probably the most horrifying part of the movie - every bone crack sent me cringing into my seat.

Finally, the performances were outstanding. Tilda Swinton definitely deserves a nom here.

ecqthl3,"Late to review since the few showings of the movie here in Boston were limited and sold out almost immediately. I absolutely loved the movie, the cinematography was absolutely, absolutely stunning. I adore Luca, so I had really high expectations coming into the theater, and I can honestly say he was the perfect director for this movie. I don't like to compare the original vs. the remake, so please keep that in mind as I detail out my thoughts. Dakota and Mia were pleasant surprises, I thought they were perfect in their roles... and my gosh, I already love Tilda but she was just absolutely divine in this. If you haven't caught I Am Love, We Need to Talk About Kevin, A Bigger Splash.. well basically anything where she's a main character, please check those out. The story was pretty messy, but each scene was memorable, and I felt so tense throughout the movie. The first dance scene was so engrossing that it took away from the final performance, I kind of wish they extended the latter for that reason. The choreography was simply fantastic, each movement of those dances was felt by the audience. The pacing was quite hard to keep up with, like the story, but I thought everything came full circle at the end.      
I can see why people walked out the theater, it was disturbing and tested boundaries. Like mother!, Black Swan, and other psychological thrillers, this is certainly not for everyone. But I for one loved these kinds of movies... and Suspiria is one of the best I've seen of this type.",9t6qga
eh37m42,"I wish someone could help me unpack this but everything I'm reading so far has not helped. I simultaneously loved and hated it. I almost had to walk out, it disturbed and disgusted me so much. It felt just like a night terror does, I think. At the same time, it was beautiful - the way it dealt with insanity and confused the eye and the visceral dances were unlike anything I've seen before and the acting and style was all perfect. But what a MESS. I did not understand a single thing that happened, and even expecting an abstract or symbolic story, I just could not follow what was going on. I'm so unsure how to feel. To be fair, I haven't seen the original film.  I get the basic lore behind the three mothers. That's about all I understood. What the fuck even happened in this movie? Do I love it or hate it?

Performance of the actors were amazing and Dakota, who I thought was bland, really stepped it up here. Also, I had no idea Tilda Swinton was Mother Markos and Jozef as well! She's beyond amazing.

What are your interpretations about this movie? I took it that Suzie was the reincarnation of Mother Suspiria all along. Her past was something either she fabricated or something she didn't want to reveal as I think she cursed her own mother, hence the mother saying Suzie was her biggest sin. Suzie was just biting the witches' traps and pretending she didn't know. I felt that while Blanc wanted to use Suzie, she grew close to her to not want to continue the ritual. In the end, Suzie wanted to reign over the dance company without the two other Mothers.",9t6qga

I decided to sit just to see if I can make a little more sense of it... and then I stayed longer.. and longer. I left impressed, confused, and have a general WTF did I just see. I woke up this morning totally grateful to the cast and crew of this movie for making it. I'm still confused but I cannot stop thinking about it. I might even recommend it to my friends.",9t6qga

1. At what moment do you think Susie realized she was Mother Suspiriorum?
2. Why do you think Susie's and Sara's eyes changed (or switched) colors during Volk? (this is the one that's really stumping me - it was obviously intentional, I just can't figure out why)",9t6qga
e9x8x7s,"Thought it was a bit of a mess but i was too absorbed in what was going on to think about it too critically/analytically. Its certainly a film you experience more than anything else. Highly suggest seeing it in a theater with a proper audience.  

As much of a mess as it was though, there were certainly a handful of absolutely brilliant scenes that rank up there as some of my favorite of the year:  
- Susies first Volk practice / Olgas death (wow! One of the few scenes ive had to cover my eyes during, but damn are those dance scenes brilliantly filmed!)  

- Final perfomance of Volk. (This was just so fantastic in all facets and definitely one of the most visceral scenes ive seen in a while. It has a real blood pumping pulse to it that you dont see every day. Incredible foley work as well)  

- This is a rather small and inconsequential thing but my favorite part of the film was every time the track called ""the jumps"" was playing. The film was so sure of itself in these moments and really got my hairs on end in the best possible way as I really appreciate how music like that is implemented in a given scene.  
 
I look forward to seeing it again.",9t6qga

Maid, Mother, Crone and triple goddess themes are obvious. There's always been  strong symbolic language about women being about agents of life or monsterous death. I wouldn't be surprised all three are three different goddess or there are two suspirias and one became crone/evil in age and the maid is the start of the cycle again from death to pleasure. While Blanc is the caring mother type stuck in between. 

Really enjoyed this movie. just felt super witchy and terrifying in places.

I can't say I fully understood the twist and the ending, but im very much looking forward to rewatching it when it releases on BluRay.

But! I think it was a really well done horror film. It had an unsettling undertone pretty much the whole movie, and that scene where Olga is being slammed around in the dance studio was a little hard to watch (in the good way).

Tilda Swinton and Dakota Johnson are amazing. The cinematography is disorientating in the best way possible and the nods to the original were perfect. Look forward to seeing this film again so I can make more sense of it so I really can’t give it a full verdict right now other than saying that it’s clearly not meant for most and perhaps it is too bloated but still a thoroughly interesting psychological horror that gives you something completely different from the original.

I feel like I’m having a Blade Runner 2049 experience where I find the sequel/remake to be even better than the original almost instantly. I was suprised by how wildly different this film was in terms of plot but it all worked to make an even more haunting nightmare.,9t6qga
e9o2hr7,"A few things,

I did not watch the original.

Someone here mentioned a video about the Radiohead effect and it was actually what I thought of when I first heard Thom's voice in the movie. I went in blind so I didn't know anything about the movie, not even who was in it (I try very hard to not consume any promotional media for films anymore). 

So hearing Thom Yorke was kind of a nice surprise, which did take me out of the film and make me think about a youtube video and the use of his music for a scene set in the middle east. But then Chloe brought me right back in.

Recognizing her was also a nice surprise but as her scenes went on I started feeling like her performance was kind of weak. I didn't know about Tilda playing the old man until like... 5 minutes ago and gosh was that a good performance.

Thom Yorke music was fine. It really worked for me.

The climax was definitely the weakest part but mainly due to execution and -as someone said- the blocking. The throne was prepared for the tribute? Markos was an on-looker in a really odd spot. The CGI was not the best. I loved the build-up with shots going red one after the other, the ensuing mayhem was... literally choppy and the music was... distracting?

And I think that's actually intended. My whole theory is about the silent witness and the guilt of inaction:

Someone here said the old man's subplot could have been done without entirely and I vehemently disagree. We open and close with him because he ties the whole story together. I understand this character was not in the original but that's because this movie is trying to do something else.

The setting helps ground the movie. It's always nice when you have world-building elements that add substance to the setting, but I think that it has thematic repercussions too. First, it serves the plot with the whole idea of Patricia maybe becoming a terrorist, but also the infamous episode of the plane highjacking felt oddly in tune with the rest of the movie. Terrorists killing themselves 'in solidarity' or loss of hope and stuff... idk that part still escapes me.

But his subplot's significance cannot be more on the nose than when one of the two withces dragging him downstairs talk about men not believing women and accusing them of psychosis, people letting their loved ones die to the system/fascists/the government/what have you. His whole bit was about being in denial about his guilt. 

That said I don't understand if he got a good ending. He was given a nice ending in that he was told how she died ""cold but not scared"" and he had his memory of the events wiped. But then when he asks his secretary her name, he says ""oh yes!"" Does he remember her? Does he remember everything but the events? Was Suspirium truly merciful with him? 

Speaking of which, she says it's beautiful three times during the climax referring to the dancing I assume. That goes against what madame Blanc was saying but I'm not sure if there is more to it.

And plot-wise, her ascension/rebirth felt kind of... not meaty. I loved the stylized nature of the film and I disagree with most complaints that this movie was *too* style over substance. The plot was not disserviced by the style but I have a hard time understanding the actual sequence of events in the plots that lead to that ending.

Unrelated note, I had most difficulty with the mute character that commits suicide. I understand it as regret, guilt, and fear of what is to come (Suspiria killing everyone).

Also, someone please tell me that madame Blanc survived! She was the nicest character in the movie and that scene (although funny) does give hope that she might recover.

e9gl1jg,"I know I'm a little late to this, but I enjoyed this movie quite a bit.  It's been ages since I've seen the original, so I'll try to avoid direct comparisons (with one exception), but I thought this stood well on its own.

What I liked: I've scrolled through the responses here a bit, and apparently the epilogue wasn't very popular, but I found it quite touching and liked it a lot. I know it was kind of out of sync with what came before, but after how batshit insane Act 6 was, a tonal shift didn't really surprise me much. And it's not like it had no setup, what happened to his wife was a recurring question throughout the movie. Speaking of Act 6: I like weird, and this was the perfect level of weird. And as a person who has next to no interest in dance, I thought the dance scenes were all pretty compelling, and I came out of the first half of the movie thinking I would totally watch a ripoff of *Whiplash* but about dance instead of jazz drumming.  You could even have Dakota Johnson and Tilda Swinton in the Miles Teller and JK Simmons roles. Finally I thought the scene where (I think, I'm bad with names) Olga got twisted into human pretzel bits was among the best horror scenes of the year. 

What I didn't like: I thought the ""Tilda Swinton plays an old man"" thing was distracting at its best moments and downright bad at its worst. I also can't help but compare the score to the original, and I don't think it lives up in that aspect.  It could probably be a bit tighter, but I can't think off the top of my head what to cut, and I think I'd rather watch the longer version with its faults than see a watered-down version. Oh and my only complaint about the Act 6 insanity is that the CGI blood was painfully bad, especially when Markos attacks Blanc.

Final comments: I live in Boston, and at the two main theaters I go to this is already down to a single showing per day.  I don't entirely understand why, my showing was packed and it was an afternoon showing, not in primetime. If you still want to see this, take the opportunity while you still have it. Also my showing today had Spanish subtitles, which I have never seen a movie like that before.

Overall I think this stands among my favorite remakes: it's respectful of the original while doing its own thing enough to stand on its own. I give it a 4/5.",9t6qga

It’s wonderful that a strange art horror film can share a multiplex with franchise films and blockbusters. It’s clear that this was a passion project for Guadagnino, but to be honest I only liked it, I don’t love it. I prefer Call Me By Your Name. Here are my main gripes:

1.	The length. Jesus Christ. If this film was 90 minutes of everything involving the academy and the coven I would have loved it, but everything with the doctor just *dragged*. I know there’s metaphors and meaning to his story but I was too bored to care.
2.	The artistic choices at points were bizarre. Why change the frame rate at random points, especially during the climax? Also as much as I love Tom Yorke his original songs were played at the wrong time (not his score, but the stuff with lyrics). It’s strange because Sufjan’s CMBYN songs were perfectly timed, but here it felt like a blockbuster where they play a pop song for no reason.

Anyway, I recommend this movie to anyone looking for something different at the box office or just a fan of horror in general. I wish I loved it more :(

e90f0o3,"Just saw this movie. Must say I'm disappointed. First the good:

I did not have any problems with the lenght of the film. Refreshing that it was not so rushed like many horror movies these days. The acting and cinematography was brilliant, especially Swinton as Madame Blanc. The dance scenes were captivating and the first ""murder scene"" made me more uneasy than most such scenes.

But overall, as a horror movie, it was bad. There was no mystery to uncover, unlike the original. The fact that so much of the film is showing the witches witching and hanging out, makes it less unsettling. There was no character that the audience could identify with and feel the horror of, other than the two ""victims"" in the sequences were they were attacked. The ending ritual was way over the top for it to be scary. Maybe if we only had seen glimpes of it, or had seen it for a short time, it could have been horrifying, but instead by indulging in the occult like this it almost felt as if celebrating it. It became weird and felt wrong, not scary or unsettling. Instead of seeing it through the eye of someone trying to escape, we were placed in the role as observers of some occult ritual where everything is clear and in your face, nothing implied, subtle or hiding in the shadows. Not scary. 

I guess my main problem with this is similar to that of many horror movies that leave nothing to imagination, where what is supposed to be scary is left completely clear and uncovered, and for long scenes at the time like here. Based on the original, this had great potential, but ended up just not being very scary, and too much shit happening without a compelling narrative or mystery.

The dancing was really unsettling which I thought was great, but there was so much of that by the time we got to the Ritual, where we were really supposed to be freaked out by, we'd seen it so much already that it was just more of the same.

e96vj35,"Ok, I went into this film knowing it was horror and about some dance cult and that's it lol. During the film, I was just mouthing WTF a lot but still captivated at the same time. I'd say I really enjoyed the film - I like films that make me ask loads of questions. I also really enjoyed the cinematography, there were loads of beautiful shots. I had to trawl through this thread to answer most of my questions though because I was very confused. I still am not 100% certain about who Markos, Suspiriorum and Blanc are? I can't remember exactly what was written in that diary, but I remember there were three main names? Including Suspirioum and Markos I think? But I don't recall Blanc being one of those names? So where was the third, why did Suspiria kill Markos, aren't they like a trio? Also, Dakota Johnson mentions a specific 'moment' when Susie realises she is Suspiriorum, does anyone know what that is? I think it might be when she wakes up from her nightmares. Oh and finally, how come Blanc was still alive near the end? I feel like there is some setup for a sequel, especially the very end, showing the love heart on the building. Perhaps this might bring back the memories for the old man and then the witches have a loose end?",9t6qga
e9z0126,"Loved it. Watched it yesterday and still obsessing over it. I was worried it wouldn’t live up to its hype, but it delivered, and even more than that! The tone of the whole movie, the rainy, dark setting of war torn Berlin made for some amazing shots and to me that’s one of the main things that elevate this film. The score was okay, can’t really compare with Goblin from the original, but there were a few moments where the sound design  really hit the spot. The runtime is long, but I really didnt notice it at all as I was so invested by that point, and honestly I can’t wait to watch it again. ",9t6qga

eed6oz9,"Suspiria tells a tale about evil.

Not the other end of the black-white spectrum of good and evil, no. It's about the evil of the past, and the evil of the present. It's the evil you can't recognize, the evil that stirs gently while everyone else remains oblivious to it. The evil that is caused by corruption and the corrupted who wield too much power. It's a film about remembering this evil, and choosing to do something about it, or forgetting this evil, believing that it never existed, and forgetting everything else that you associated with it.

In other words, it's nothing short of a modern horror masterpiece.

The film on its own is a horrific experience, and Luca Guadagnino's vision remains unchallenged, in my opinion far surpassing what Argento was aiming for with the original. Every single death is convincing, with the practical effects being spectacularly real and gruesome. There's a prevalent sense of tension and disgust that maintains itself constantly and never lets go. As the film progresses and both the characters and the audience become more aware of what's lying underneath, it leads straight to the final 30 minutes, which can only be described as nothing short of jaw-detaching.

The cinematography, although not as vibrantly lit as the original Suspiria (at least, for the good first portion of the film), still possesses remnants of the way things were filmed in the 70s - the zooms and camera movements pay a huge homage to the way things were crafted and filmed back then.

The acting is beyond comprehension. Dakota Johnson instills a familiar yet eerie presence that never leaves the film and is deliberate in every sense of the word. Tilda Swinton's portrayal of three characters is astounding, and she totally brings something radically different to each of them. The rest of the performances are also very good, but some do fall behind others and can be deemed as slightly mediocre.

The screenplay juggles so many ideas that it's incredibly easy to see all of them fall flat on their face, but there is a certain amount of balance to how they're handled, and even if some of these ideas are expressed disjointedly, the ones it feels like prioritizing shine so well. David Kajganich is definitely a writer to look out for, as not only did he add so much substance to the original film, he essentially defined a new meaning and a greater purpose behind what the original Suspiria could have achieved. And that is fucking commendable.

Suspiria ultimately sears its brutal, grotesque imagery into the viewer's mind, constantly driving home the layers behind what defines the truest of evils, and how neglecting and forgetting past evils leads to chaos in the present. It's a disturbing, horrific, but macabrely beautiful work of art. And although it's not a film for everyone, it will remain forever with those that it's meant for.",9t6qga

e8zvte4,"I get criticisms, my patience was tested at times. But much like mother!, I liked that this one challenged me. I like that I can go to the movies and see a super ambitious and self-indulgent art-horror movie at the theater. This thing was all over the fucking place, but given the source material, I appreciate the madcap route they took. The original was style over substance, and it looks like that may've been the approach to everything, which gives it all a cobbled together dreamlike feel, even when nothing hinky is happening. Many of Argento's trademarks are there, from the focus on architecture to the use of funky SFX that appear more theatrical than cinematic. It also weirdly reminded me of one of my all-time favorites, Fulci's The Beyond, in its warped depiction of reality. Tilda Swinton's role(s) are nth degree weirdness, and that climax was Clive-Barker meets David Lynch. I'm still digesting it but, even for the slow parts, this is what I want to see.

e8ygv6j,"Saw it last night and, despite it being too long, I still enjoyed it. When the credits rolled, I really felt like I was coming out of a long dream. Maybe that's because I was pretty buzzed while watching it but to me the whole thing felt very surrealist and nightmarish. 

Dakota Johnson really surprised me and Tilda Swinton was great as always. I loved that her performance as Madam Blanc was much more muted than other characters I've seen her as. Usually she's a pretty whacky character in a lot of films, and she is to a degree since I found out she was actually the totally disturbing Mother Markos, but yea. The relationship between Blanc and Susie was one of my favorite things about the film. 

The dance sequences were filmed amazingly. I loved the eroticism and visceral nature of them. The way they spliced Susie's first dance with the absolutely BRUTAL and torturous death of Olga made it all the more intense. I'm a horror fan and that might be one of the most jaw dropping death sequences I've ever seen - it went on for awhile and I cringed every time the poor women was bent in a different direction. 

I'm not sure what to say about the ending other than I'm glad I got a great climax to a very long film. It was totally bonkers and I would probably go see it again just for that. Maybe I'll wait for home release but good lord. Mother Markos was like a mix of the naked zombie lady from The Shining and Pizza The Hut from Spaceballs (plus all slimy and bloody). Naked people were exploding, Susie looking over it all in awe, poor Madam Blanc got nearly decapitated and I guess that was the Devil or the real Mother Suspirium fucking things up? There was so much shit happening that I couldn't keep up with it. 

Similar to the original Suspiria, I enjoyed this most on a sound and aesthetic level. The plot kind of held things together but I really had trouble following the doctor's subplot (which I think should've been cut way down) and all the post-war symbolism. The witches story and performances inside the school is what I enjoyed most. 

Most fans of horror and the original Suspiria will not enjoy the movie but I'm honestly glad it was made. Original horror that pushes the genres limits are what I'm really into these days and this one did just that. 7/10 for me. ",9t6qga

I see evidence of both since Susie seems like a naive and vulnerable girl in the beginning of the film.  But, her mother also repents on her death bed for her youngest daughter which makes it seem like there was some witchy shenanigans going on back home in Ohio.    

Also it was pretty early on that she walked into the back room and found the bewitched police inspector and she didn't seem all that bothered by it so that is probably more evidence that she was always more than what she seemed.  ",9t6qga

As a huge fan of the original, it was great to see Jessica Harper.  I love that it's not exactly like Argento's Suspiria but not so different you feel like you're watching something completely different.

Thom Yorke's soundtrack oozed off the screen and it's tendrils sunk themselves into my brain. Again, nothing like Goblin's pulsating soundtrack but just as amazing.

Not sure I can call it a horror because I was never particularly scared (though definitely felt uneasy), but it's probably my film of the year. The '70s zooms, the dancing scenes (I'm not even a big fan of dance!), the sexual tension and power games between Madame Blanc and Suzie Bannion... And then there's the out-there ending... While the film is not quite as batshit insane as ""mother!"" (which I also loved), it's still unique and worth checking out.

I watched the original Suspiria for the first time on Friday, and I was ultimately disappointed. It felt like the two same music riffs and lighting tricks were used over and over...

The shocks were good - even though I was a bit checked out Sara's leg breaking got a good reaction from me, and the Olga sequence and the hooks was early enough that I was still really involved and that was really effecting - but the ending just felt like a lot. Like, maybe I missed it but was the main girl Suspria the entire time, or did the ritual put Susperia in her body instead of Markos? And I assume the black corpse thing was Suspiria's old body? I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong. And maybe it explained all of this and I missed it.

I think it may not have been my type of movie and I wasn't in the right headspace to try something completely different like that. There were parts I liked. The old professor's story was good, even if he felt completely unnecessary. If it had caught me on a better night I may have felt differently, but as it stands I'd personally give it like a 5 or a 6.

But I do think there is a market for this film. I think there's a lot of people who would be into it. Horror fans. Dance fans. Arthouse fans.

The performances all around are great, it's very well-edited, and it also handles a delicate balance of expanding on the original without spoonfeeding us at all. It has a greater sense of place than the original, and I appreciated that it was about more than just witchcraft. The context enriched the film, if at times it became a bit overbearing.

I was REALLY not a fan of some the music with vocals. Maybe it sounds fine on it's own, but especially at the end it was incredibly out of place. She's destroying people with the power of witchcraft and blood is everywhere and we are hearing some whiny sad vocals. None of this was particularly scary or tense, but it was a bit unsettling.

- I have no idea how the therapist missing his dead wife plotline is supposed to connect to the dance academy

- The slow-mo and music during the finale sapped away all tension to the point where it almost became laughable

- Tilda Swinton playing the therapist was distracting.  It was clear based on the appearance and the voice that the therapist was being played by a woman.  Why do that?  There was no reason for it

e8yi7yr,"Saw this a couple nights ago, and posted a review on /r/horror already. Just gonna repost that here: It was exhausting, artsy, epic, disturbing, confrontational, and horrific.
  
Not that I'm saying anything new here, but - this is sure to be a divisive movie. The NYT compared it to a Che Guevara t-shirt in its depth, a parallel that I think is misinformed and basically stupid. I got very little in the way of political commentary from the movie -- instead, I found it to function as an artistic (but updated) homage to Argento-style horror.
  
If I were to break it down into a recipe, I'd say the film is 40% horror, 30% art-house, 25% thriller, and 5% pastiche. Great halloween movie if you want something smart and slow. Its like the art-ier alternative to the Halloween remake this year.
  
This movie featured some of the most intense sequences I've seen in recent years. The already notorious body-horror dance sequence comes to mind as the highlight of the film to me. It has been a while since I've seen brutality executed so masterfully on film, due in no small part to the actress' performance in the scene. There are several pieces of this film that are confrontationally violent and horrific, and they all work very well for me personally.
  
Meanwhile, there are parts that express just as much discomfort and malevolence without anything in the way of graphic violence. In particular, Guadagnino is able to illicit extremely visceral reactions from the viewer using the dance sequences. I found this especially impressive considering that I know absolutely nothing about dance or choreography.
  
This brings me to my next point of discussion: the score. Thom Yorke's score was a mostly-positive mixed bag for me, with extremely high highs and just mediocre lows. Hearing contemporary music-celebrity Yorke's voice against a 70's-inspired aesthetic felt jarring at times, but I felt the score was nothing short of incredible on the whole, especially when it leaned more instrumental. In fact, I have spent most of the day today listening to the score on Spotify -- context in the film aside, its just great work by Yorke.
  
I would highly recommend it for the technical merits alone, if nothing else (there is a 'but' here, coming soon). I'm curious if it was shot on film or digital. Aesthetically it is a beautiful homage to 70s horror films -- some of the camera work is jarringly stylish. For me, this camera work was perhaps my favorite thing about the movie, but (like so much else in this movie) it would be easy for someone else to hate outright. The color pallets used throughout are beautiful in their restraint -- everything is either very drab, or very red. Perhaps a little heavy handed on paper, but executed beautifully. The HUGE exception to the technical mastery is a lot of absolutely head-scratchingly AWFUL CGI blood splatter near the end of the film.
  
The length is my main issue with the film. I wouldn’t say that it drags but the runtime is probably the main flaw of the film. That being said, I arrived 45 minutes early to get a good seat, and then there were about 10 minutes of previews. So, I was in my seat for 3.5 hours -- I could see that having an effect on how long the movie felt. Other reviewers have said the exact opposite (that it felt much shorter than 2.5 hours), so take my word with a grain of salt here.
  
Overall, I’d put it at an 80/100. Falls short of some of the great horror movies (The VVitch, Blackcoat's Daughter...) to come out in recent years, but is a hell of an experience. I felt absolutely drained after seeing the movie, and I don't know that I plan on watching it again anytime soon. If you are looking for something a little more out-there than the Blumhouse Halloween this Halloween, look no further.

eeh0xek,"Only my interpretations based, of course, on the nature and small details of the film:

1. Blanc did not have his head mutilate and this is visible. Markos only used a ""paralysis"" spell on her. This is easily understood when we see that it is still alive, but without movement. The point there is the cinematographic thing rather than Markos just speak ""Paralyze"" lol;
2. Blanc uses that ""something's wrong"" speech at the beginning of the ritual, at last 30min of the movie, not to want to protect Susie and to love her, but rather to feel the energy of the Mater Suspiriorum stronger in Susie. Still, Susie didn't stopped Markos of paralyse Blanc, because she is Suspiriorum and wants to rule the world haha;

Please, lemme know what yall think bout that.",9t6qga

There were more people in my theater that I was expecting, so I wonder how much they’ll keep expanding it but this is NOT mainstream friendly by a long shot. That climax really will break this for some people but I think if you liked Mother! you’ll enjoy it.  Dakota Johnson (who’s been one of my favorites for years) absolutely shines here and the acting was great all around. Despite the two and a half hour running time, I was fully engaged throughout",9t6qga

e99yhbi,"All the praise Suspiria is getting really goes to show how over hyped horror movies are these days. Literally this movie is over 2 and a half hours of Tilda Swinton in distracting old man makeup (for whatever reason) coping with some lost love spliced in with some ""spooky"" nightmare images that look like they're taken right out of that Niomi Watts Ring movie. The climax that was supposedly sooo shocking was just silly. We got a Paul Verhoveon mutant looking person and a bunch of characters heads exploding that we don't even give a shit about because this bloaded ass movie didn't bother to develop any characters with the exception of old man Swinton. That epilogue was so heavy handed and unnecessary. What a mess. ",9t6qga
e8yr1wt,"This was not a horror movie really at all, felt much more a drama to me with some haunting moments(dream sequences, finale, dancer twisting scene) but even then I really really dug this, but there's so much I still haven't even unraveled about this movie even after a few days and I think I should see it again before I really say whether I straight up loved it or anything but I'm definitely on the positive side of things I was fascinated the entire time, Dakota & Tilda were absolutely fantastic, every single part of the technical elements were near perfection...the editing, the cinematography, the sound design, the music. The finale has this moment where the music swells up and we see everything thru a handheld camera and that just made the scene that much more effective. Looking into something as fucked up as that it felt so much more raw and scary than it did beforehand. The makeup looked absolutely phenomenal - loved the look of Markos, the devil, Josef, and the part where Dakota rips her chest open to reveal a vagina(?) all of the makeup/CG was so seamless.  seen a lot of people complaining or mentioning the length sticking out but I felt that it the film moved by so briskly I didn't feel that the film ever slowed down or lingered on one thing too long making the length really show. 

I remember being grossed out just reading the descriptions of the scene where the girl is twisted and contorted as her body breaks from cinema-con and in the movie I was bracing myself for it but to my surprise I was just glued to the screen. The way the music, the editing & the choreography all came together made that scene probably the highlight of the entire film.

One of the main things I'm not too sure on is why Josef's involvement/subplot was absolutely necessary? He didn't really move the plot forward, he only led to investigate and send cops but they were diverted - he only kind of wound up being the reason two girls got in trouble/smart as to what was going on but they didn't do anything that stopped the witches or anything and ultimately reached where we would've regardless of them interacting with him or figuring everything out and being scared of their teachers. 

Also do you guys have any interpretation as to what it was that Dakota opened her chest to reveal, like what was going on with that? Love to hear what some of you think because I'm completely lost there haha.

e8yn937,"So I've got a lot of mixed feelings, mostly positive. I just got back from seeing it a couple of hours away since the release is so limited. As a huge fan of the original, I can say that I enjoyed this for what it was and all the depth it added to the lore (I've never seen the other Mothers films) and characters. It was neat seeing the changes they made to what was already a very thin plot. A few things that bothered me was that Miss Griffith, the one the kills herself at the table, didn't seem to have a purpose? Unless I missed something with her. Also, while I liked seeing Jessica Harper on screen, I wasn't really sure what point her and the doctor served to the overall story, as well as the hijackings and other political things of the era it was set in. I also wanted to see more of the hooks in action. The soundtrack was hit or miss, Volk was fantastic but I felt the track that played during the finale with the vocal singing as she massacred everyone really took me out of it. The performances were pretty great overall, I liked the new Miss Tanner, Tilda was phenomenal as always, I was surprised by Dakota's performance, but Mia Goth as Sara was just so good, the stand out to me hands down. There were subtle nods to the original, like Sara counting the steps to the hidden door, Susie getting fatigued during her early dancing, and other things. Overall, it was a great reimagining of the original that I didn't feel to disappointed with. It's not one to see again in theatres but definitely will buy on Blu Ray. ",9t6qga
e8zomxx,"Overall, I liked it a lot just of how disturbing and unsetteling a lot of it was. I cant remember the the last time I felt that uncomfortable in a theater. 

I thought aside from Tilda Swinton playing the old man the acting was pretty good. It was way too long at 2.5 hours for a movie that had little plot yet a ton of stuff going on. The oldman and terrorist subplot added nothing to the film and should have been cut.

While it wasnt scary, the first five acts were very disturbing and creepy. You could hear everyone in the theater starting to get uneasy right before any of the nightmare sequences. Some of the images in this movie are going to stick with me for a long time. However, the sixth act was so over the top it just got too goofy for me to take it seriously. Still was entertaining, but with everything that came before I was expecting something terrifying and it just didnt deliver.

Its not perfect, but I enjoyed it a lot for what it was.",9t6qga
e91bnf7,"There are lots of questions on here relating to how long Susie was Mother Suspiriorum and I think the fact that it’s so unclear what her progression is demonstrates a flaw in the film. Whether that be an issue with writing or Dakota Johnson’s performance, or both, I’m not sure.

e8yd43t,"I'm glad that Windows Screensaver has branched out to new roles.

I'm still a bit confused about the ending and how Suzy was Mother Suspiria. I guess they hinted at that when her dying mother said she was her biggest sin. Did Blanc survive with half her neck missing? And why didn't Suzy kill the witch helping Markos in the last scene?

  The backstory of Suzy is also a letdown and totally unnecessary and adds length to the plot.

I also think they see the thematics as cliche, but I always appreciate more work that views being a woman as a form of horror even though this was largely spearheaded by men.

I think my biggest interest right now is the movie's interest in tying the story to the political climate of Germany at the time. A lot of critics wrote it off as a way to describe the setting but how it ended and who the characters ended up being I felt was supposed to describe a lot of the director's and writer's feelings about current politics and feminism, so I definitely want to rewatch it as well so I can try to understand it better.

Based on the opening scene and a few others where she was unsettled. However, it's still not quite clear to me if it was suicide or compelled by Suspiriorum.

Guadagnino has mentioned he originally intended for this to be called Suspiria Part One. He has an image in his mind of one of the older mothers, it may be Markos actually, standing on a hill in Spain in the 1200s or something like that. I'd be om board for that. ",9t6qga

I didn't realize she actually played him, but the whole movie I'm going ""BOY he sure does look a lot like Tilda Swinton"" and expected that to be a plot point later in the film. And the scene where he was walking down the stairs from the police station and turns to talk to the detective I noticed his voice sounded higher pitched, as though Blanc had sort of possessed him or something and Swinton did vocal overdubs for the scene. Made the movie all the more confusing trying to keep that in mind waiting for it to come back up. I gotta give this a second watch for sure!",9t6qga

e9at9rb,"I’m not 100% sure of this, but in an early scene when Susie is doing floor work, we see a creepy dark clawed hand stroke the underside. Then there’s dialogue that suggests that was Mother (Markos). But I think the hand was actually that of Death in the form we see later, and the witches were confused and mistaken about who she was communing with.

Another thing I am confused on, perhaps I missed a line explaining it...why does Josef have Anke’s papers? Was the line the witches gave her in his fantasy (“I went back to our apartment, but my papers were nowhere to be found!”) the truth even though nothing else was? Did he abandon her and take her exit papers, leaving her to die? I couldn’t tell from the ending and his guilt if that was supposed to be suggested.

Edit: Oh and about that cafe scene (the arm cracked me up), it seemed to establish that the girls and teachers are in pairs, and that they all seem to resemble their girls in appearance. I’m curious whether they’re all feeding off girls and this is just Markos’ turn for a ritual, and whether the abilities the girls are given are less given them by the coven, and more them being puppeted or channeled directly each by one handler during the dancing, like Sara was in Volk.",9t6qga

No one came for this plot point.

e9y0gt9,"TBH I didnt watch the first 30 minutes of the movie because I got to the theatre late, but I didn't hate the ending monologue. I think it existed to establish the intent of Suspirium's character without ever actually giving her a playbook 'now that im here, im going to do this.' She sat there to underscore that she didn't approve of his involvement in their ritual IMO, she saw it as excessive even though he represented inaction and doubt towards women.

I think it was done to show that despite that, he did his best, he was just always too late. But the women in his life trusted and loved him and he tried to do good by them, and similarly those women supported and were supported by other women. In a way, it establishes his character as an ally who was wrongfully tortured.  In comparison, susie seemed to have little compassion for the male police in the movie. I also think its worth noting that Suspirium absolved the male character played by a woman, that was deeply in love with his wife to the point where her safety and happiness and company is the illusion that the witches used to vex him into their trap. 

So his character I feel like existed to interrogate the meaning of being a witness and being a victim, the existence of power and being powerless. It flipped his character from being someone a woman was confiding in to a character that a woman was consoling, so it represented a change in power dynamics, especially when the character was played by Tilda Swinton who represented both matriarchial and patriarchial presence for the dancers.

Also, it describes the Mother character as someone almost singlemindedly concerned with the wellbeing of women. His wifes redeeming features in her eyes were that she was not afraid to die and that she befriended other women. Which ties in to the brutality she showed the women who defied her versus the kind, gentle release of death she gave the dancers who were mutilated in the quest to give Markos power. I'm kind of iffy on this interpretation though, but I think she more or less dismisses the matrons altogether when she told him, 'i dont agree with the actions my daughter took.' Considering they were never actually trying to ressurect her, IMO i think she just saw an opportunity in the midst of everyones suffering and took it, and was like, 'yeah i'll fix everything once i get there. Sorry.' 

I kind of enjoyed the weird tonal shifts of this movie though, it's probably my favorite part. Rather than horrific, which i think detailed all of their efforts to preserve each other and Markos, Suspiriums entry wasn't supposed to be scary for anyone but the people who defied her. The people screaming were the witches who voted against Markos but were inactive in stopping her after. Their lives were comical to her because they tried to preserve themselves over her intention. Thats why by the end of the bloodbath, even though all the dancers had blood on their faces and were convulsing when they slept, to them the lives of their overheads were meaningless. Just a crazy, wild night, and then a return to their routine with new management. 

Oh yeah, so i think while Markos was supposed to be grotesque, she wasnt particularly scary, and i think she was rendered that way to show her as a false leader to the group, as in, despite all this time the coven spent backing her, she was ultimately powerless and didnt seem to even kill Blanc by the end.

He had a really interesting line too during the climax, wasn't it like ""Are there no innocent men in Berlin?!"" Curious, maybe something about him rationalizing his perceived innocence during the rise of the Third Reich? I'm just thinking out loud.

And I definitely agree with you're point on the climax being a bit inelegant. I felt the blocking was kind of weird and it was a little too over the top with the CGI blood stuff. I will say though, one of the shots that stays with me is Suzie slowly opening her throat and having a weird black tentacle hole thing be there. Apparently that was supposed to be a vagina?

I almost feel the same about the story arc with the doctor. While I found it interesting & heartbreaking at times, his inclusion in the epilogue was... coincidental, and it didn’t gel together with the main plot of the story effectively enough, for me.

I think it's perfectly fine in circumstances like ""A Star is Born"" which is built around musical performances, or a means to drive the absurdity of a story line like the rap music in Office Space, but not in Suspiria where tension is needs to be kept at a certain level.

The director believed in Yorke in that ""he's an artist and that if they put their mind to doing something like this despite never doing a score, the results are always good.""  Or something to that effect.

Instead Mother Suspiria was dormant in Susie since birth and had slowly been directing her to Berlin. During her time at the dance academy Susies (Mother Suspiria) powers grew until the final ritual at the end where Susie Renounces her birth mother and fully accepts Suspirias spirit. Now that Suspiria is fully reencarnated she takes control and kills all who falsely claimed Mother Markos was the real Suspiria. 

As for the black thing its of mixed opinion that its either the embodiment of death itself or of Suspiria. ",9t6qga

iiub41c,"3 years late with a reply!

During the end scene, they mention Markos was 'annointed' Mother Suspiriorum, meaning it's a title/set of powers that is granted to a witch.

After the vote at the start, the implication is that if they chose to have Blanc lead, they would leave Markos to die, as her body was going to imminently give out. This suggests that they are aware the title will continue after Markos dies.

Susie seems to have been born a witch. Her mother knew her daughter was a 'stain' on the world. And Susie not only was drawn to Berlin from a young age, but studied the ritual 'Volk' dance to the point that she knew it instinctively.

I believe Markos and her coven had grown greedy and corrupt, and whatever evil/elemental force had annointed her chose to nuture a replacement in Susie, who either secretly knew her destiny from the start (none of the events phase her - she even laughs at the police posession), or slowly became aware of it while in Berlin.

The witches are evil, but not necessarilly completely so. Blanc has compassion, and seems opposed to Markos' ways. Susie also has compassion for the doctor, and the murdered dancers. It seems whatever force is behind Markos decided (like Blanc) that she had deviated from her set path or duties, so purged her and her acolytes in favour of Susie, rescinding both Markos' title and powers.

This also further implies that 'Mother Susperium' is an archetype, and there is always a Mother of Sighs. If one dies, another is simply chosen. Or in this case, they can even be fired and replaced.",9t6qga

I love studying film and have a soft spot for horror. I love complex plots that I have to unravel on subsequent viewings.

Luca's directing was very odd: zoom after snap-zoom after zoom felt very 1970's. He kept breaking the 180-degree rule too. At the time, I passed it off as ""Luca trying to disorient the audience"".

But the thing that got me the most was the cheesy, dubbed, Albert Nobbs-looking motherfucker Josef. What relation did he have to anyone? I don't care, because I'm so distracted by how incredibly stupid he sounded and looked. The Epilogue was such a slog.

Caroline (the jumping student) was obviously seen being comforted by one of the staff after her 'seizure' and would later be seen in a restaurant, sitting right next to the same staff member as each student sits alongside a teacher, with each older member almost grooming the other intimately.

Also I appreciated the use of practical effects but honestly mother Markos and Patricia looked plastic to me and it killed a lot of the disgust and realism. One of my favorite reviews of Suspiria by Mike Lasalle mentions that the movie had potential, combining the “outrageousness of Argento with the humanity and human insight of Guadagnino” could have been amazing. “Instead we get a movie that combines the body terror, gynophobia, repulsiveness and vulgarity of Argento’s work with the loosely structured, long-winded self-seriousness of Guadagnino’s.”

On a positive note, the graphic design was absolutely beautiful, whoever created that font and the posters/title cards deserves extreme recognition. Tilda Swinton is awesome and always will be.

When she embraces and mourns for the dead Markos at the end, I think it's because even if Tanner had doubts that Markos was Mother Suspirirorum, Markos has been the leader since the beginning, and the mother of the coven with a lowercase m.

e9u06ei,"It's there to tie together the metaphor of ""coven = Germany""

After WW1, Germany was in a pretty crappy situation which wasn't really its fault--everyone made them responsible for the war when things were a lot more complicated that just ""Germany is evil."" Similarly the witches also experienced a crappy situation where they felt victimized as women in Third-Reich era Berlin. But then Germany wanted its power back, so it lashed out horrifically against the weak and downtrodden. Similarly the Coven used its magic to dehumanize those they saw as an enemy. Eventually Germany was split into two factions, East and West, and the coven was internally divided over whether to follow Markos or Blanc. Markos, a bloated liar feeding on youth in the name of shared beliefs but really just trying to extend her existence as long as possible, and Blanc, more capable of dealing with the outside world, but rigid and controlling and unwilling to do things a new way. (East German leadership accused West German leadership of being antiquated Fascists). 
 
The new generation of witches (and the new generation of revolutionaries) are linked by the character of Patricia, aand also Olga and Sara. They struggle against the established power struggles, feeling deceived and angry, that their leaders are hypocrites. And like the radicals who hijacked the plane, they fail. Things are only overturned (and the coven, re-united) by Suspirium's return.

East Germany had long championed itself of the party of the people. The party of workers and laborers and common people. But this was a lie (like Markoff lying about being the embodiment of Suspirium). The REAL workers and common people rose up and remembered who they were in 1989, when the Berlin Wall came down. Germany is reborn peacefully.

(The film focuses on the hijacking rather than the peaceful revolution because most of the film is concerned with what happened to Patricia, what just happened to Olga, and what could happen to Sara. It would have been less. Onsistent to focus on another part of German history as the tension between the two stories would not have been compatible)

During all this time, the German psyche is not only divided (represented in the coven), it suffers guilt (Josef) and feels orphaned and disconnected from its history (Susie). Definitely some other stuff I missrd, but that's why I feel the hijacking was such a big plot point.",9t6qga

They're known as the Three Mothers and are basically viewed as deities by the witches. Markos and Blanc, on the other hand, were two (normal) witches who were fighting for control over the coven. However, Markos had more supporters and remained as the reigning leader of the coven. 

Patricia also wrote Markos' name in her journal, but Markos was actually never part of the Three Mothers. Markos claimed that she was an incarnation of one of the Three Mothers, specifically Mother Suspiriorum, but unknown to everyone, Susie was Mother Suspiriorum and she ended up killing Markos and all her supporters, who were basically following a false idol. I'm not too sure about the moment Susie realizes she's Suspiriorum or why Blanc was still alive, though. My theory on why Blanc was still alive is because Suspiriorum spared her for not engaging in something blasphemous to her. definitely going to rewatch it in the near future when i have the chance!",9t6qga
ef2hduy,"What exactly confused you and what was your interpretation? To me the message seemed clear, but I obviously could be wrong. It seemed to me that the movie was about the way power corrupts, and the almost inevitable way that dogma, religion, ideology, can become perverted and twisted. The witches were so corrupt and venal that they were unable to recognize their own god when she returned to them. They had all this power and they used it on petty games (stripping and mocking the security guard) and outright sadism (the pleasure they took in driving the hooks into Olga.) Their leader was the literal manifestation of this, with her deformities and decay, and yet the witches blame their inability to restore Markos' body on the girls; it was all the girls' fault for not being somehow perfect, and never their own fault for not doing it right. So Suspiria returns and gives them ample time to recognize her, but they fail. The only one who passes the test in any way is Blanc. She finally shows some small amount of love in attempting to protect Suzie from Markos. So the angel of death passes over and burns the rot from the coven.

There is even a scene after Olga where the witches say they ""took their anger out on Olga,"" and rarely does horror come from an empathetic portrayal of the villain. What happens with Madame Blanc by the end could be construed as sad, as she really differs from the portrayal of Blanc in the original. Blanc (Swinton) is a much more steadfastly ideological and committed character who realizes and changes their opinion and perspective, whereas the other witches don't universally acknowledge a need to evaluate Markos' claim.

The way I see it, Mother Susperiorum is evoked by the struggle to overthrow oppression. She empowers the powerless; her coven is built on female empowerment forged by centuries of patriarchal oppression. But her coven has lost their way: the oppressed became the oppressors. And they (the witches) are essentially using their power in blasphemous ways whenever they use it to exploit & torture helpless young girls. 

Mother Susperiorum is neither good nor evil. She is just a force of reckoning. All the evil deeds that the witches commit were made falsely in her name, as it was Markos who whom they were really serving.

I don't think the girls were conscious during the dance sequence. It seemed to me that they were in a sort of 'daze'. We already know that the witches have the power to use the students as puppets (think: Sara in the main dance sequence, as well as Olga in the torture scene.) We also know they have the ability to erase memory (the epilogue). So I think it's fair to say that the girls weren't 'present' for the ritual, therefore not counting as witnesses.

I also think it was more fitting that the witness was a man - given the role that gender played in the film.

Not totally sure, I think she missed a step or something, potentially due to the fact that her and Sara looked directly into each other's eyes, and perhaps she noticed that Sara's eyes had changed and that she was possessed, which snapped her out of whatever trance she was in.

e93s04d,">The politics in 1970s Berlin plotline was completely lost on me. I didn't understand what was going on at all. I have no idea how that is supposed to connect to the dance academy

i agree that this was the most extraneous part of the plot and probably could have been cut. i think the hostage subplot is meant to parallel the situation of the girls at the dance academy: they are essentially being held hostage by the coven, manipulated and sacrificed to serve a larger goal beyond their comprehension. these external political conflicts also mirror the internal political landscape of the dance academy, as there's a divide between two factions within the coven (those who support Markos and those who support Blanc) that eventually explodes into violence. here's a Wikipedia article on the historical context of the movie, the [German Autumn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Autumn), and the [Landshut hijacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa_Flight_181)

>I have no idea how the therapist missing his dead wife plotline is supposed to connect to the dance academy

that character, Josef, is wracked with guilt over his inability to save his wife, Anke, from the Third Reich. this figures into one of the themes of the film - eternal recurrence (or rebirth), our tendency to repeat the mistakes of the past - in that he also fails to save Patricia or Sara. two of the witches explicitly refer to this when they capture him at the academy, mocking him for his impotence and inaction in the midst of a crisis. this also ties in with another theme, that being the transition from an era of patriarchal dominance (embodied by the male psychotherapist) to uninhibited female power (embodied by the coven, and particularly Susie at the end of the movie). it's significant that Susie came from a strictly patriarchal Mennonite background, because her climactic transformation into/reveal as (depending on your interpretation) Mater Suspiriorum is a complete refutation of that religious doctrine: Christian vs. occult, Male vs. Female. 

>Was the dance performance supposed to have any kind of meaning or significance beyond being a dance where they're wearing red ribbon and granny panties?

the dances are rituals. 

>How did no one at the academy know that Markos wasn't Suspirium?

no one knew for certain, but Madame Blanc suspected as much. she says this to Miss Tanner, that they wouldn't be in the situation they're in if Helena Markos really *were* Suspirorium. that's also why she's uneasy during the climactic ritual and states that something is wrong and it needs to be stopped. i think she knows on an intuitive level that Markos is not really who she claims to be. 

>What are Blanc's thoughts on Susie?

ambivalent and complicated. she's obviously intrigued by Susie and senses great potential in her, but throughout most of the movie she treats her like a sacrificial lamb, i.e. treats her nicely but with the ultimate goal of sacrificing Susie to Markos coloring the whole relationship. but as their relationship progresses, you see that she's resistant to that idea and urges Susie to reconsider at the start of the ritual. i mean, Susie even says it: ""because you love me."" i would say she has a distorted maternal affection for Susie. ",9t6qga

e93rm5e,"> Was Susie Mother Suspirium the whole time?

I think she was. Her mother knew she will be a stain on the world. Also the reason why Susie was obsessed with Berlin as a child, that's where her daughters are. You can tell something was off when Susie was amused at the sight of the matrons playing with the policemen instead of telling Sara.

> What are Blanc's thoughts on Susie? Why does she act weird towards her at the end?

During their private meetings, Blanc shows that she loves Susie and doesn't want Markos to take her.",9t6qga
e93z573,">Why does Susie tell the therapist at the end that ""we need to feel guilt and shame""?

e96vdc0,"> Tilda Swinton playing the therapist was distracting. It was clear based on the appearance and the voice that the therapist was being played by a woman. Why do that? There was no reason for it

Looks like there was. Tilda Swinton plays three roles in the movie, Blanc, Markos, and the therapist. Blanc tries to save the girls, Markos wants to continue to exploit the girls, and the therapist sits by and does nothing to save the girls.

I really don't think I agree since me and my friend came out of the cinema completely sure that the movie implied subtly that Blanc and Susie were lovers (we were positive about it), and then we were shocked to learn apparently we're the only ones to think that in.. the world? I remember the first thing I said was ""I wish they'd carried the plot with a bit more subtlety, just like they did with the romance thing"" 😂 so yeah I think Blanc was trying to protect her. 

By the way did anyone find the moment when Miss Vendegast tries to hold Blanc's head and puts it back in place only for it to fall and dangle again unintentionally comical?

2. Miss Griffith was a Markosite and I think she was getting nervous about the impending ritual. Perhaps she had doubts about Markos or had doubts about her involvement in the ritual as a whole. The only real context the scene gives is they are discussing Markos not being able to hold on long enough for them to groom Susie.  
  
3. As far as the subplots, the themes of the film are not as much about rebirth as you might believe but moreso about the ""new guard"" taking over and resistance to that.

e99zt3g,"Omg I'm so happy you brought up the idea of lineages. I've been analysing the film through the lens of the psychoanalyst and philosopher Luce Irigaray, and one of the big connections I found was this idea of lineage. One of Irigaray's criticisms of Freud and Lacan is that the mother's lineage is snuffed out, and only the father is given credit for the child becoming a person-- the father gives language, law, and his last name to the child, while the mother is little more than an animal, just there to give birth. I see that paralleled in the film, where Susie's birth mother, as the sexist paragon of a mother, is destroyed in the renaissance of this composite of all these different and complex other ideas of mother-- witches, friends, Blanc's relationship as a kind of mother to Susie, and then how Susie is in fact the mother to Blanc and everyone else. The film shakes up our preconceived ideas of what a  ""mother"" is, granting the title incredible power , even the power to destroy prior concepts of the mother-- ""death to all other mothers."" ",9t6qga
e95ckec,"Yes, you’re right - there was a lot of imagery centred around mirrors.

I’d love to learn more about Jacques Lacan, and I certainly will look him up. For what it’s worth, the theory I posted above is only one component of the film. As you know, it also has themes of the Holocaust, the Berlin Wall and all the grief, sorrow and shame that exists within the divided country. I’d be interested to know if Lacan’s work would also fit with the other themes that are present within the film, which would give it more credence.

Anyway, I’ll look up his work before commenting any further on that.

Lastly I’ll just say - regarding your response to my theory of the transfer at birth - yes I agree that this is the one leap of faith I’ve taken in my analysis that isn’t explicitly backed up in the film.

Let me say, though, that the reason I feel it is possible - if not likely - to be true is that we already see the death spirit (which I believe to be part of Mother Suspiriorum and not a seperate entity that simply arrived at a convenient time) travel back in time to visit Susie’s birth mother on her death bed.

If you recall, we see Susie’s birth mother lying in bed when suddenly everything turns red, and her eyes widen as she sees the death monster standing over her, the shadow of its hand over her face.

At this same moment, Mother Markos tells Susie that she must kill her birth mother (or maybe it was reject - I admit my memory is fuzzy).

To me, this implies that not only is the death spirit present in the room with Susie’s birth mother as she is dying, but Susie has the power to exhibit control over whether or not her mother lives or dies - even though her mother died months earlier. Therefore it only makes sense that Susie has the ability to travel back in time (with the power of Mother Suspiriorum inside her) and retroactively change the past.

I don’t want to get bogged down in further detail if you disagree with that premise, so let me know your thoughts on whether you think this is plausible.",9t6qga
e99z7x7,"Yeah, reading up on Lacan has been helpful in how I understand the film, but an even better source than Lacan (who is mentioned mockingly in the film, I want to point out) is Luce Irigaray. I recommend everyone who's into Suspiria and really wants to analyse it to read up on Irigaray's reworking of Lacan's ideas, especially her ideas on women and the Mother, which really echoes the shifting and complex representations of, and focus on, these in the film.",9t6qga
e9gz849,"My interpretation: Markos was trying to trick the coven into believing she was Mother Suspiriorum. Markos wanted to use the ritual to get her spirit to enter Susie, so she could live longer and no longer deteriorate all while posing as their figurehead. What she (and the coven) didn't realize is that the true Suspiriorum had already been reincarnated inside Susie. I'm pretty sure Susie (Suspiriorum) killed Markos and anyone supporting her because they had been following false teachings. That's why Blanc notices there's something different and tries to stop the ritual, because she begins to see through Markos' lies and knows Susie isn't what she originally thought (Blanc is trying to figure it out in the intense stare-downs leading up to the ritual).",9t6qga
e958vtn,"I assumed it was because Markos is old and her physical body is failing. I think they might have even said as much. I don’t think they knew about Susie in advance.

e8zoysy,"Hereditary's ending I found to be pure comedy.

I honestly don't think I've laughed at a movie harder this year than this one.

",9t6qga
e8yk01w,I think Mother is more shock value than actually at all bizarre. Suspiria is bizarre.,9t6qga
e8yix6c," Just watched Susperia like 2 hours ago and couldn’t stop thinking about mother!. Even though this movie was seriously fucking crazy at the end, I feel like I was more prepared for it than mother!, which I knew nothing going to see it. I only knew that a lot of people didn’t like it (I fucking loved it).",9t6qga
e8z257x,No not even close imo. Suspiria’s ending is great but honestly not that unexpected or surprising. The pretzel scene is definitely more wtf,9t6qga
e8yin40,Yes. But they are close. This one is just way more violent.,9t6qga
e90dexc,Her screams were fucking brilliant omg. I was petrified. ,9t6qga
e9j3z1q,Yeah she got a little booty now I'd smash oh and Club penguin forever ,9t6qga
e8z53ji,To be fair a bigger splash doesn’t rly give a warm feeling,9t6qga
hhbxx7e,"It’s funny you make this comparison  bc Suspiria actually did give me a very warm feeling of almost… empowerment? Obviously not a warm cozy sweet feeling, but a powerful feeling of righteous retribution. It was so strong that at the end I was enraptured by the absolute emotional release from the ritual.",9t6qga
e90o6kz,Certainly saved herself a more gruesome death than what Suspiriorum delivered to the rest at the end.,9t6qga
e92nzm5,"Yeah I think you're right, she seemed able to sense things that the other witches couldn't. She also seemed far more empathetic - perhaps to a fault.

  
It's also worth noting that she was the only one who chose not to cast a vote for either Markos or Blanc, which contributes to your theory that she knew who Susie really was, therefore uninterested (or unable) to worship any other false idol (or false mother).",9t6qga
e94t8ff,"If this tone and quality keeps up sure, bring it. ",9t6qga
e9a76sx,It's called a trilogy.,9t6qga
e949jc6,"Right!? I can't imagine why, when he was contracted to score this film, he decided to go with ballads. And his voice seriously just gets under my skin. ",9t6qga
eevs2u8,"i thought thom's score was subpar as well, but funnily enough i think that scene was the only time where it actually made sense and was 100% perfect.

that entire scene was a triumph of love - in the most fucked up and bizzare way imaginable. so i found it very fitting to hear ""come under my wings, little bird"" - a beautiful love song being played while peoples heads explode. 


fuck that was an amazing scene. ",9t6qga
e8ynw0d,"Oh damn, she would be perfect in a Lynch film. Like Naomi Watts in Mullholland Drive or Laura Dern in Blue Velvet. She has that wide-eyed ingenue thing going on, but there’s a depth there when she’s in the right hands.",9t6qga
e8z4hiy,"Agreed. And actually, the more I mull over the movie and her performance, the more I like it. She really gave the dancing her all, which was super important to this film, and I can't think of many actresses in the same age range that I think could pull off the balance of ""believably ingenue"" and ""sinister in a vaguely otherworldly way"" as well as she did here. (Like, Alicia Vikander, maybe? But it's a short list.) Plus you have to give her credit for holding her own with a champ like Tilda. I'd love to see her try her hand at a Lynch-ian sort of script. ",9t6qga
e8zj4du,"I don’t know if I agree with that. I remember seeing 50 shades of Grey (the first one) and thinking it only had 2 saving graces: Good cinematography and a good self aware performance from Dakota Johnson. She’s good, she’s just in too much shit",9t6qga
e9be7mn,"Good point! I thought it was also a nod to the original, where there's a poster in the station of ""the Black Forest"" which is itself a nod to the origin story of the witches, who were supposedly born somewhere in the black forest. ",9t6qga
e9f91ij,"Tilda also plays Mother Markos, if you didn't know that already. It adds some fascinating layers to the film-- that all involved parties are women at their core, for one. Another is that it adds to the film's theme of struggles and suffering in deeply internal spaces, having Tilda as the antagonist against herself in these different ways. In an interview, Guadagnino has mentioned you could view her three parts as Id, Ego, and Superego (you decide which is which). I don't think the film is worried about keeping a firm boundary between itself and the world external to it. I get the sense that the film is self-aware, of those three characters sharing an identity, of its having an audience (the post-credits scene where Susie/Suspiria looks out at us).",9t6qga
eer7s2r,How so? ,9t6qga
e9awp6s,"I thought the same on the Dark Clawed hand, but i re-watched that scene at home (not a dark cinema) and the hand is most definitely not dark, just aged. It looks to just be Marks' hand.

&#x200B;",9t6qga
e9meqns,"Yes. She hesitates. They say ""Griffith?"" And she says something like ""You don't need my vote, it's already decided (as in Markos already has enough to win. But alternatively, we know there's another reason the votes don't matter). They say, no, you gotta vote, and she votes Markos before slumping against the wall in distress.",9t6qga
e9fahrc,"I just got ahold of the original script, and in it Susie and Sarah actually DO swap eye colors, and checking back over stills from the film, I see this is true and I was mistaken about Susie's eyes not changing. But the bigger point I found interesting was that it's not just that their eyes change color, but that Blanc is dancing through Sarah's body. Anyway! Yes this film is ornately decorated with little details, have fun finding them all! Definitely go see it again if you can :)",9t6qga
e9lr9wy,I said to myself during the movie “I’m probably gonna really love this movie the second time around”. there’s really so much going on. I knew there was no way for me to digest it all in one viewing. I feel like this movie is a grower. The more you see it the more you’ll appreciate it. ,9t6qga
e9f8bzs,"I think you meant Susie, not Sarah. She wasn't talking about Blanc, she was talking about what it felt like to dance Volk. I think Blanc was asking both from aroused curiosity and because for the magic to work, it seems that what the dancer feels/their intention plays a part. So she's checking to see if Susie was emotionally connected with the piece, enough that she might be a viable candidate for the spell to work. But she's also obviously personally amd erotically intrigued by Susie as well. Her little smirk, asking Susie ""were you punished?"" for sneaking out as a child made that clear enough. Beyond this scene it becomes even more clear that they love each other and possess a special intimacy and connection. I think the movie did an excellent job portraying the love between the two women, especially at the beginning of the Black Sabbath scene-- Blanc's imperiousness cracking to show distress and vulnerability when she doesn't want Susie to die for Markos was poignant. ",9t6qga
e9nk7m3,"Maybe Guadagnino is was trying to emulate the bombastic nature of the original? I dunno.. At times it was clearly intentional, but at others I don't think so..  
 
And yes--Susie was mother Suspirium since birth, which is why she said ""I am  She"" when she summoned death to kill the Markov loyal witches, and why her mother disowned her as her ""sin"" at birth. It's also why Susie was so drawn to Berlin since childhood. ",9t6qga
e93zg6q,"I actually was eating the pretzels during this scene, didnt make the connection but did have to put it down at a few points lol",9t6qga
e932vuq,Butterball cenobite is all I saw.,9t6qga
e91vh8t,Dr. Finklestein?,9t6qga
e97jf71,the whole ending scene started well but unraveled poorly.  somethings would have been better hidden or in shadows like mother markos.  also the choppy editing during the final dancers exploding scene honeslty just pissed me off.,9t6qga
e8ykv3h,Not sure. They did all bolted out really fast too as soon as he started having the seizure too so maybe they were just getting tired of all the disturbing stuff even though nothing bad happened.,9t6qga
ea11tvg,"Even though you probalby know it by now [but there was a really long disturbing (but perfect) sequenze right before the Epilogue](#spoiler) that drifted the movie in a crazy bizarre direction. If you walk out after that as a ""casual"" movie goer I can absolutely relate to that.",9t6qga
e97j79e,she never dies in the movie,9t6qga
e906u1q,"When the professor was walking through the rain and it was in slow motion I was just so confused.

 There were a couple of ""low quality"" shots like this and I'm wondering if it was just supposed to be an homage to 70s film making?

In Act 3, I believe, when the girls go out on the town and see all the teachers at the restaurant one of the last shots was this super grainy and super close up of the window looking out towards the girls and all I could think was ""Wow, they just straight up CSI New York ENHANCED the original shot to get this""",9t6qga
e90fjuk,"They used it once or twice earlier and it was fine, like with the shot of the professor walking through the snow, it actually looked pretty cool. But at the ending scene it just looked awful, especially with the handheld camera work. Didn't look good at all. Very disappointing in such an otherwise beautiful film",9t6qga
e8yq19h,Yea and then climax with what happened to all the witches who voted for the opposition. There is much more than that too. I feel like when this movie wasn't freaking me out it was bludgeoning me over the head with fascist symbolism. ,9t6qga
e901kv4,"Did the colors of the subtitles mean something? They switched between red and blue outlines, but I couldn't figure out why.",9t6qga

e8yjstj,"I mean, it being in 250 theaters in its 2nd weekend isn't anything unusual for an Amazon studio film no matter who's in it and how good it is. Their most successful film, Manchester By the Sea, didn't get to 250 theaters until week 4 despite having Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams in it. The difference is that movie eventually expanded to 1200 theaters whereas this will probably top out at 500-600 or so.",9t6qga
e8yuv7z,I’m desperate for it to come near me and it’s bloody nowhere.,9t6qga
e96gh5f,I think the creature under the studio was still Markos. She sensed that Susie would be the perfect vessel. Death only emerges when Susie's mother dies.,9t6qga
e99vwli,Pretty sure it's just Markos. They straight up said they put her in a storage closet underneath the floor. ,9t6qga
e99tsjl,"Why would Death show up as being drawn to Susie when she's first performing the ritual dance ? The black character with nails is clearly shown then reaching toward Susie.  I'm confused where everyone is convinced that is Death from. To me that was mother suspiriorum, waiting for the ritual to be complete so she can transfer In Susie. She had drawn her from birth and was coopting markos' ritual.  This also plays in with Susie saying ""it feels like I'm not even here yet"" because the ritual wasn't complete . And here saying g she was not in a position to help the dr, again because the ritual wasn't complete",9t6qga
eb99nj8,"Welll... there WAS a post credit scene...

Dakota Johnson was looking at a wall. (we can't see whats on it)

I can imagine it was the other two mothers.

e94hn01,"It felt like it also gave some context to how serious the tensions were in Berlin at the time. It felt real, and added to the world building that they were going for. ",9t6qga
e913mon,"It's not about driving the point home or making sure you get it, it's about how problems in a small community can translate to problems in a larger community and that even though they are different issues the roots are all the same.

If you think about it these issues are happening three times over in the film. The young rebels vs the old government, the young students vs the old witches, and the old witches vs the ancient mothers. In some form each is the next generation trying to overcome the last despite the obvious disadvantage. The movie is implying it's in our nature, not trying to nail one plot into your head. I really don't think a couple of voiceovers and background subplots is that bad to convey it.",9t6qga
e90uxch,It’s too on the nose. We get it stop pushing it on our face. Other than that the movie was good imo just needs some serious re-edits ,9t6qga
e967q8h,"That’s true, I guess I just thought it was pretty redundant. 

And you’re not the only about Josef plot. I didn’t mind it as much, although I thought his progression just slowed down the build up to the climax. 

I strongly believe the movie would’ve benefited with a shorter run time, so I agree his part should’ve been at least cut down a bit ",9t6qga
e9oz30c,"I think a shorter length yes, but the old man worked well I thought. Esp in the epilogue,we actually got the only bit of warmth in the film",9t6qga

e9gypmp,I respectfully disagree. The contrast between the song and the violence worked for me and most others I saw it with.,9t6qga

I felt the same way with CMBYN as I'm not a fan of music-with-lyrics playing over *any* scene (unless it's used in a diegetic sense), but after watching that film another few times I really came to appreciate and enjoy it, specifically Visions of Gideon.

e9f9hx2,"That, and I think she also already felt deep guilt for what they were doing to the girls. Most of the witches viewed the girls as tools for their spells, but a handful seem to feel genuine tenderness and distress at hurting them.

She both feared the coming of Mother Suspirirorum and regretted that they had hurt so many girls in the pursuit of a false idol",9t6qga

ef3kecs,"When everything happened in the end, I got all of that. In rethinking about the movie, I understood all of what you said. Except, in agreeing with those points, as a watcher of the film,  Suspiriorum descending on the school, rehearsing, having nightmares, gushing over Blanc, making new friends, learning the steps for the dance and other moments of confusion blows up the plot of the film to me.

eh17iau,"> art film.

Then say that. Saying a movie is going to be 'this generation's The Thing' and then backpeddling by saying 'This generation's art film Thing'.

This movie is already being forgotten. This thread hasn't even hit 1000 comments months after it's release and even professional reviews on rotten tomatoes gives it 65%. Sure, it's got some good points, but it's far too inaccessible, and dare I say it, not actually good at communicating the horror it claims to transmit

Honestly, I thought the original suspiria did a better job than this one. 

I'm also just tired of this crap where people gush over art-house films saying 'this is the best movie of the decade' every time one of them comes out. Sounds like a bunch of 'everyone deserves a medal' thinking to me.

And dare I say, stole ideas from other shows? The whole dance-as-channeling-power thing was stolen almost verbatium from The OA. Seriously, a netflix film, and they do the same highly-stylized snapping body dancing. They don't even explain how or what purpose the dancing has with channeling the power or what power it creates. It certainly isn't the ability to see a coup coming.

I don't think it captures the evil of a coven of satanists/witches very well at all though. There are too many unmotivated character decisions - like randomly sitting down and stabbing yourself at the dinning room table. I found myself scratching my head at about 3/4 of the things people did for seemingly no reason at all - unless I made one up. 

Instead of creating believable characters, we have a bunch of characters acting somewhat randomly, not seeing at all the garbage about to go down, and then the film lazily doesn't give the viewer a clue as to how or why these things are happening. I felt myself connect with NONE of the characters because they simply were too stylized to feel even real.

There's letting the viewers mind fill in the missing pieces, and then there's lazy garbage that simply doing stuff for the sake of doing it and saying 'let the audience figure it out'.",9t6qga

e99y8o3,"On my first watch, with no context, I thought all three Mothers were in the film, although it focused on Suspirirorum. When Olga walks toward her death, she and the suicidal witch are both overcome with tears, so I thought Mother Lachrymarum's influence was shown there. And later, I thought Mater Tenebrarum was the demon lady. Now, I'm not sure. But I do wonder if the sequels will reveal that the second all-powerful lady who stood equally with Suspiria in dealing judgement and who seemed made of pure darkness and caused only death and darkness was in fact the first appearance of Tenebrae. In the source material by Thomas DeQuincy ""Suspiria de Profundis,"" he claims that Suspirirorum and Lachrymarum, after they've done their work, lead souls to Tenebrae to deal with the soul's final destruction. I think Suspiria summoned her mother-sister to take the offending souls. Calling it now! We'll see when the sequels come out-- super excited for those and hope they come through.",9t6qga

**B-**

That incantation scene where everyone’s naked and it’s all shot in red as heads explode, I wanted to *love* that scene but the way it was shot made the movie feel b-rate with the kind of causal walking around in an obvious studio set having actors just dance around.  And the music that played in the beginning and end that had lyrics felt out of place; this should have been strictly instrumental.

 Unfortunately an empty theater didn’t creep me out more, but that’s probably because I’ve been so desensitized to scary stuff being a horror junkie.

https://m.sendspace.com/file/8pdi6g

What was the witches motives? 

**To find a suitable vessel for Markos to continue living.**

What was that finale at the end with the black monster?

**The black monster was Death. Summoned by Susie.**

In the finale, what was the ritual the witches we're doing?

**It was a black mass meant to facilitate Markos transfering herself to Susie.**

In the finale, why was Susie snapping her fingers to explode everyone's heads?

**At that point she is fully Suspiria. Shes basically a God so shes killing off the followers of Markos who was calling herself Mother Markos ""Death to all other mothers""**

Why did everyone tell her they wanted to die and she hugged them and then killed them with her touch?

**They were in a trance, hence why Mia Goth, Chloe Grace Moretz and the mirror room girl were standing perfectly still even though they were disemboweled.**

What the hell was that plot twist where Susie said ""I'm the mother witch"" like wtf how could she be the leader witch when she apparently didn't even know about the witches running the dance school till late in the movie anyway?

**She was Mother Suspiria or fated to be her since she was a child. Hence why she always wanted to learn about Berlin.**

Why did the witches abduct the old Jewish guy? What did they want with him, why was he naked, and what were they doing to him?

**They needed a witness for their ceremony. They discuss this in the pub when they are all having dinner.**

Why then do they release the old guy later?

**They don't need him to witness anymore, besides Susie/Suspiria apologizes to him on his bedside and says shes sorry for the way her daughters treated him and that she wasnt yet in a position to put a stop to it. Besides if the God you worship suddenly appeared in the flesh and started exploding the heads of everyone that didnt believe in it, and that God said to let the old guy go unharmed. You're going to fucking do what it says quick.**

Why does Susie visit him?

**To apologize, wipe his memory of his wife and the girls at the dance academy, the black mass, to protect her coven.**

Why does he have a seisure after she visits?

**She tells him shes going to touch him and the memories of ""the women of your undoing"" his wife, the girls at the studio will melt away in the sun and he will have no memory of it.**

Why did Susie rip her own chest open at the end and what the hell was that black demon thing inside her? Why did the woman with big glasses stab herself in the neck randomly?

**She ripped her chest open because shes a God. Its supposed to be a second mouth which looks like a vagina.**

Why did Patricia look like she had been drained of life?

**They were keeping her in that state for the black mass later on. The witches can obviously control people, once she left the doctors office at the beginning we probably don't see her fall back into the clutches of the witches.**

How was the Holocaust lovestory related to anything else at all in the movie.

3. The ritual was to transfer the spirit to the vessel, but interruppted and became a dance for Suspiria instead

4. Suzie realized and became Suspiria when her earthly mother died, as the movie sorta forshadowed she would be.

5. They all 3 had horrible trauma and wanted to end it.

6. She didn't know she was the boss lady until her birth mother died, reincarnation of her self into a new form

7. They wanted a witness to their witch activities, and chose him.  They didn't do anything too him except get him naked, and everyone else was naked for the most part. His part was just to watch.

8.  His part was just to watch.

9.  She doesn't approve of them using him to watch and clears his memory.

10. He's forgetting the witches and girls.

11. That was some shit.  She was suspiria and thats just how she rolls when in full mother mode. Probably the movie letting us know she's not human anymore.

12. My guess is the woman stabbed herself because she didnt' want to follow Markos and wanted out.  Its not as easy as leaving.

13. She had been drained, they wanted to use her first as a vessel for Markos but failed.

14. It wasn't, but they wanted to make the old guy more sad and add more bleakness to the 1970s berlin.  It was an odd choice and not part of the original.

15. There's still a lot I'm probably not getting either but the movie was at least fun for me.](#spoiler)",9t6qga
e90mt75,"The witches coven’s doesn’t have much of a goal. Even in the first Suspiria they just exist. They were working towards doing something for Markos (the hag) which I believe is a body transfer. 

The black thing is summoned by Susie/ Suspiria is death. 

They were doing the ritual for Markos. 

Susie was enacting revenge for Blanc. She was targeted everyone that didn’t vote for blanc to be the head of the coven. 

It’s implied and said that their magic is based on suffering, shame and guilt. The people asking for death are mercy killings. They could continue to live but would be suffering. 

She has always been mother Suspiria. Her own mother said so. She wasn’t ready to be awakened. She actually awakes from one of her nightmares saying she knows who she is. 

He was needed as a witness for the ritual. 

Because he isn’t needed and Susie doesn’t want him for anything. 

She wants to apologize for the witches kidnapping him. She directly says this. 

He has the seizure because she was wiping his memory of the girls he hurt because he didn’t believe them and they suffered for it. 

The black chest thing is implied as her not being human and part of her power. The girl with the glasses I think saw who Susie was earlier and that’s why she was nervous. Maybe she voted for Markos. 

Patricia was being drained to fuel the coven’s magic. 

The holocaust story I think was to ground us by giving us a human element but it was mostly unnecessary. 
",9t6qga
e936d18,"Last question about the Holocaust: The Holocaust is a reflection about the innocent people lost and trapped because of false leaders like the cold war background and Markos pretending to be what she's not. Under the instruction of false leaders, the citizens or dancers are trapped and tortured and treated badly. Under the outsider, Susie, the true leader or like the USA intervenes to come and take back the citizens for a good balanced force. This movie's weakness is that it focuses too much on two themes rather than one, Motherhood and false leaders. They should have cut this whole part out cause it's too extra, along with the flashbacks to her childhood. We can understand the concept of false leaders fine with just it being in Berlin. Wiping away the memory of the old man is a way of saying that sometimes we forget the choices of evil made in the past and continue to select false idols who bring evil and hatred to our innocent populations. AKA Donald trump. The dream imagery in this film was also very pretentious and could have been more creatively dealt with or completely removed.",9t6qga

Their relationship isn't really discussed in this one. Then there's the false ""Mother"" Markos, who claims to be Mater Suspirirorum and wants to be called Mother, and she kind of has been the mother of the coven for a while, but she turns out to not really be one of the Three. What do you think  about if Susie was Suspirirorum the whole time? What sense of purpose did you get from the ritual?

In the same, you don’t have to personally categorize it as such, but you can’t stop others from doing so. People look for different things in films.

and then for seemingly NO reason other than Suspiria was actually a pretty stand up gal, she comes and presents facts that warm the professors heart for NO reason. Why? She had NO motive at all, other than actual genuine empathy and care. Like, immediatly when Suspiria took over, the other witches became not good, but like, way better than under Markov's rule. 

And on top of that, the actual scene where Suspiria/Susie was talking to the old man was arrestingly well performed. I was mega impressed and felt such elation and joy.

It's just theatrics because the movie needs it, to get to the plot twist moment.

&#x200B;

I also honestly don't understand why Susie would let Blanc get decapitated (I seem to understand she's not dead in the end but the movie doesn't really spell out the situation as well as it should, imho). It honestly seemed ""for the hell of it"" too, to me.

This Suspiria is a horror movie but the stuff that's sticking with me more and more as I think about it is not specifically the disturbing or horrific elements of the film but the wildly different approach Luca took to this story, his vision for it and all the elements of that story which is what I'm getting at when I say how fascinated I was by it & that I would just personally refer to it as a horror-drama while I'm leaning more so on the drama side.

Turns out the red one was death, I was reading. I thought the ritual was to put Markos into the body of a young woman. I guess it turned out to be something else. I thought the three mothers were vying for control over the coven. The names of the mothers you mentioned are they from the remake? What are your thoughts on the red demon, was that a mother? 

Susie I think was always mother Suspirorum, but didn't know it. Remember she challenges Swinton's character at one point and she seems to want to do the ritual far before the ritual happens so she knows something. In the beginning she rubs her chest that she opens up later on. Towards the end before the ritual she is speaking to swinton without opening her mouth.

If you get a chance to watch again, you'll notice all the telepathy-- witches staring into other scenes, through walls and floors of the building, and telepathically communicating constantly. On the first watch, you assume a lot of the voiceover of witches talking to each other while something else happens is your typical narration. It blew my mind to realize, oh shit, that's not voice over narration, that's then communicating right now in front of us! Like when you hear them voting, but you're watching them prepare dinner, you think you're hearing how they just voted or are going to vote at dinner. But no, they're voting in their minds together as they set the table! Rewatch again, and you'll see how the characters are reacting as they vote. Suicidal witch slumps against the wall after she's forced to choose Markos (since she's already realizing, I think, that the real Suspiria is on her way to take vengeance and they all f'd up in killing an innocent girl to keep Markos alive). And in one of the film's many tiny smudges of humor in unexpected places, Blanc casts her solemn decision to abstain while she's grabbing a box of cereal from the cabinet. But back to the main question, if you go back and notice what's happening around the witch smiling at Olga, it's that the message is going around telepathically to the witches that Olga's about to go down, and the witch receives this message right as she asks Olga if she's okay, which mean witch finds hilarious, knowing Olga doesn't know she's about to die.

ea5qoiv,It’s not though. That’s actually a very old ritual that has absolutely nothing to do with vampirism. Much closer to witchcraft and if anything vampires are almost inspired from it. ,9t6qga

The actress of the black demon(ess), is the same of Susie's mother. In her home in Ohio there was the tapestry saying that a mother ""cannot be replaced"", but she renounced her birth mother for Mother Suspiriorum (or supposedly Markos, which turns out to be an impostor). Which is ironic to use the same actress to interpret the dark female creature, as if she still is her mother. Whith this, I believe that the character ""Death"" is actually  *Mater Suspiriorum* (in her ""true form"" if we can say it that way). The mother of sighs is related to the last sigh of a human, therefore Death. That's why after ""Death"" disappears from the altar, Susie reveals her inside to be as dark as ""Death"". I assume that Susie only fully became the Mother of Sighs from that moment, killing her past as a mortal human.

>Guadagnino explains that the end of the Black Sabbath sequence is a melancholic mourning of Susie's mortal past:  Halfway through editing the sequence I said to Thom Yorke and Walter Fasano, my editor, that we had to instill a moment of deep melancholy, because when you become, you are evolving into a new person, and you’re mourning the end,” Guadagnino explains. “It’s the death of the previous version of yourself, which is what happens in the movie. We wanted to create a bridge between this fierce horror and this very melancholic sadness.

This connection between characters through the actors isn't the only one in the movie. Tilda Swinton portraying three characters also makes a symbolic connection as Guadagnino explains:

>I wanted Tilda to be the three characters in the movie that in a way represent the universal idea of psyche from Freud: the id, the ego, and the superego.

And as [/u/pm\_me\_your\_molars](https://www.reddit.com/user/pm_me_your_molars) explains in this thread:

>Markos is Id (concerned only with survival) Jpsef \[sic\] is Superego (attempting to make sense of the senseless) and Blanc is the Ego (rational and self-possessed)

To sum up, the moral of the story can be resumed as: don't lie or you'll get caught and punished. As Markos faked her identity as the Mother of Sighs and in the end she was caught and punished the mother herself. 

P.S.: Not sure now if Susie showed her inside after ""Death"" disappears or during her presence. Although it still makes sense to her transformation to Suspiriorum.",9t6qga
