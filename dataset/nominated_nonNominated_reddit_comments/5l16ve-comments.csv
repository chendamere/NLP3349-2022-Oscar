dbs96gc,"Man, the kid who played Young Saroo was phenomenal. Just a fantastic performance.

I really enjoyed the movie, except I felt like they rushed through Saroo's adopted childhood, and I would've liked to see more of that, to understand the dynamics between him and Mantosh.",5l16ve

dbsbjwo,"The type of rich, diverse stories that producers in the US should be buying/funding.  Great acting from both Saroos, great score (second only to Jackie, maybe?).  Two things that keep it from being overall great:  I think we needed more time with young Saroo in Australia and more time with adult Saroo before he becomes so obsessed.  As it is, it goes quickly from ""kid gets new home!"" to ""young adult still feels lost and kinda crazy"", and I could have used a little more of a bridge.  Awful, while the writing overall is pretty good, Nicole Kidman's speech about her vision of a brown boy in the field...brutal.  Overall, really good flick.",5l16ve
dbshpxr,"How was Patel's Australian accent? Because from the snippets I heard from the trailer I thought it had the potential to be one of the best, if not the best, Australian accents of all time.",5l16ve
dd3hdxq,"I feel sorry for the real life Mantosh, whose portrayal in this film was pretty harsh. I don't recall the book suggesting he had drug problems. He interacts with the family and works for his dad's company. 

Judging by a comment on his Facebook page, he found the interpretation of his character offensive and hurtful.

Saroo handled it fairly sensitively in the book, not giving too much away, but they seem to have used stretched the limits of poetic license in the film.",5l16ve
dc6ralq,"I'm really happy to see this thread. I was looking at an old one from before the movie came out and I found a lot of nasty comments about how Saroo was stupid because he didn't know his way home. We are all commenting on computers and technology that comes so easily to us that some people don't even realize their privilege. He knew how to get to his home by himself from places near by, but he ended up extremely far away. He mispronounced the name of a small village that might not have been on any map. The movie ended saying that 80,000 children are lost in a year, there aren't the resources to try everything to reunite each child. They put his picture in the news paper, but his family couldn't afford a news paper and a news paper may not have even reach their village. He was also uneducated and when moved in with his adoptive family, it was the first time he ever saw a map. Also, unlike in the countries most of us are from, I read that he feared going to the police, because they didn't help beggars and would just bring him to an orphanage. A lot of people on the street were unwilling to help and they ignored him. I was also heartbroken to see people call her a bad mother. Yes, in our privilege countries, parents would get in trouble for letting their child do all the things that he did and she would be considered a bad mother, but we don't understand that poverty: to not be able to feed your family, to work for hours and get maybe a rupee, to beg for scraps just to get by while still being hungry. Being a single parent is hard even in privileged countries (#spoiler)",5l16ve
dckjyt6,"This movie fucked me up. Our problems are so trivial comparatively.

Beautiful film. Sunny Pawar should win best supporting actor, if not best actor, at the Oscars for real.",5l16ve
dbua9vl,"So was the brother hit by the train that night? My friends and I thought the writing at the end was a tad confusing. It would have made sense if so because that's why he didn't come back for Saroo. Either way, so sad once we read that news :(

Really enjoyed the movie, I hadn't seen Dev Patel in anything since Slumbdog Millionaire, he's just FANTASTIC. He also got extremely handsome.",5l16ve
dcxm759,"Great movie. Definitely lopsided though, just because the first half was so much more engaging with young Saroo being so phenomenal and the stakes so much higher. Dev Patel was great but 10 minutes or so could've easily been shaved from the back half, or maybe shown more time in India.

I agree that Mara's character wasn't great... but the lowest point for me was the monologue by Kidman. I mean, most of it was powerful when she was talking about loving both kids and choosing not to adopt, but it really suffered from that bit about ""having visions at age 12 about adopting a little brown boy."" And she keeps referring to the kid as ""it."" And does this mean she refused to adopt asian or black kids because her vision specified the kid had to be brown? It was very silly and contrived. I wonder if it's because the real-life mother had a bit a religious streak that they felt obligated to touch upon.

All in all, definitely deserves the oscar nom although some flaws from the back half make it hard to say it deserves to win.

But seriously, Young Saroo running was the cutest fucking thing. ",5l16ve
dbsbsdm,"It was a good film, though there are some flaws. Rooney Mara's character felt like a tacked on love interest that barely affected the plot. It felt a little too serious or over-dramatized at times, I know the guy was troubled over his past but at times there could have been a few more moments of joy.

Still, it has a great musical score. The movie also managed to keep a great flow of the events, keeping it from losing suspense.",5l16ve
dbspojp,"Young Saroo was amazing. Really great perfomrance. Very believable. 

Those ""trafficking"" scenes really hurt and I still think about.  Held back a lot of tears at the end, especially the scene where [Kidman talks about how she can have children.  What a powerful scene.](#spoiler) ",5l16ve
ddofr4n,I am grown ass man and I found myself crying like a little bitch while watching this movie. I felt the worst for his bro Guddu. In some way he was spared the pain of not seeing his brother for the 25 years and probably feeling guilty for having taken him with him. This was just a purely emotional and beautiful movie. ,5l16ve
dc09dmo,I completely lost it with the bike riding flashback at the end on the train tracks... Haven't cried for a film that hard in a while.,5l16ve
dd9lu3o,"The first half in India is amazing. The last 20 minutes starting when Saroo stumbles upon his home town is amazing. That middle half hour was not very good and holds it back from being truly great.

The first 2/3 of the movie I kept thinking to myself ""Lion.....why is this movie called Lion? I'm sure there's some symbolism that'll show up later to clarify."" As the last act unfolded, I forgot all about it. Then those text overlays popped up at the end....added a great deal of frission to the emotions I was already feeling.

God damn those last twenty minutes are so powerful. Holy damn.

I agree with the criticism that Rooney Mara's character is wasted. His adoptive brother, though, I feel is a bit crucial to this movie. That relationship needed more attention. A big theme of this movie is the relationship between brothers. It starts and ends with Saroo and Guddu. Guddu is constantly appearing in his thoughts and dreams (more than his mom I felt like). There is definitely a thread here that the director tried to explore but it isn't very well realized.  ",5l16ve

dbsa795,"Yes, so happy to see this discussion thread after posting [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5kv4xg/lion_and_its_unique_niche_in_the_oscarssowhite/) just a few days ago. I saw the movie and was so eager to discuss with others!

Overall, the movie was really moving and, in my mind, avoided a lot of the cliches that I  thought might be coming.  Sunny and Dev ably carry the entire movie and I thought they both did an outstanding job. 

Reading a little about the actual story, I would have liked to see more of the real details included in the movie (apparently he rode multiple local trains around Kolkata for a few days before leaving the train station) but understand why they weren't included. I would have also liked a little more backstory on the brother and delving more into Saroo's relationship with him vs that of his with Guddu. 

Did anyone else think it was odd that Saroo never mentioned his sister? I think it was because he was closer to his brother but it was odd that he only mentioned that his mother and brother were looking for him, but never mentioned Sheikla, his sister. 

I loved the cinematography - the overhead shots to mirror the shots from Google Earth were great. 

Not a dry eye in our theater at the end - I really loved it. ",5l16ve

de1vh2q,"I loved this movie portrayed being adopted and not really connecting with the culture of the country you were born in. When he had trouble eating with his hands, people asking where he is from, etc...

Being adopted myself I get this all the time. People asking if I celebrate Chinese new year, if I speak Chinese, if I loooooove rice, etc etc...

I think the movie handled it well and hopefully now more people understand. I was adopted as a baby, I don't remember anything and my parents are Canadians. I'm more Canadian than I will ever be Chinese.",5l16ve
de3jk01,"I loved this movie. As a whole I understand why some people thought it was slow in the middle, but I thought there were so many great scenes (the scene where the kids are learning the names of the utensils??? So great.) I cried hysterically about 100 times, but 3 scenes stick out to me:

-The scene where Saroo meets with the lady at the orphanage, and before he leaves he stops and asks, ""Did you really look for my Mum?"" Sunny Pawar absolutely slayed that scene and the actress playing the woman was great, too.

-The scene where Saroo meets his adoptive family. Nicole Kidman's face was so full of wonder.

-When old Saroo sees Ganesh Teile on Google Earth and says, ""Ami."" *cue me having a full on loud sob*",5l16ve

ddh832w,"It wasn't a perfect movie; but I think it's an important story that deserved to be told. Haven't had to fight back tears in a theater like that in a long time.

With all the shit going on today (I know you could say that about any time period but still) it's important that people see something like this. The world is so much bigger than what we perceive in our own lives. I have nothing but respect for Sheru's parents, it takes a lot to bring in a child like that and fully embrace who they are. No one is perfect but I think they are great people for doing that. Not my favorite film of 2016, but probably the most emotional one. I'm a bit sad it's not getting more attention.

edit: also the child actor for Saroo looked just like his actual childhood pictures; I was amazed by that. Would be dope if that kid won something",5l16ve

dcxeefs,"I fucking cried in the cinema for the first time in my life.

Lion isn't a perfect film - the second ""act"" of this film in Australia is nowhere near as good or powerful as any of the stuff in India, and suffers mainly from some pacing problems... but I can forgive all that as there is a wonderful story being told here, and the acting from old and young Saroo is just wonderful... oh, and it made me bloody cry.",5l16ve
dbsznk7,"i highly suggest everybody who loved the score for this movie to check out the works of Dustin O'Halloran, especially his group A Winged Victory for the Sullen. their newest album had many tracks featured in Lion. i've adored him and his group for years, as he's director Drake Doremus's right-hand collaborator, so that was my main selling point to see Lion.

dcg5qdq,"Just watched the movie today- wow, there really was not a dry eye in the cinema. I held it together until the very last scene with the two Mums hugging. As an adoptive Mum myself, it was particularly poignant. 

The scenes with young Saroo in India were so well done, it almost made the rest of it a let down. ",5l16ve
dcwzhnv,"Young Saroo and Guddu and their mom's performances were so beautiful, subtle, believable and endearing. 
Their bond is beautiful and I wanted to cry before anything even happened.

Rooney Mara's character was totally not needed in this movie, and if anything completely slowed it down. That whole part lost my interest from what was an incredible start. I was only happy when she got out of the picture, and we focused again on Saroo's return to India. I was aggravated whenever she would reappear in the picture. What she said was inconsistent, and I did not care whatsoever about her. But I guess every movie has to have the whole ""love"" thing. In this one, if they made it a less central part, the movie would've been phenomenal. I don't get how she got a spot in the front cover..

Does anyone have theories on what Noor and Rama(?) were up to? I still can't fully tell whether their intentions were harmless or not.

I had minor story quibbles - mainly with Saroo's adopted brother - I understand why it needed to be dramatized but I thought the source material was so strong.  And I understand having the American girlfriend so that there is a love interest.  But these were little things that are easily overlooked by the strong first and third act.  Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman are both excellent.",5l16ve
dbu4pcr,"This movie was so powerful! The critics weren't kidding when they said it was a tearjerker. Lovely score, cinematography, acting.

ddyzx0d,"Seen the movie about 2 weeks ago. I think it's absolutely magnificent. I had some issues with characters Lucy, Mantosh and also Nicole Kidman's 'vision'. Though the part she said she could have had a child but chose to adopt instead, was powerful. Anyways, my biggest issue was the score! Which is the most favoured part of the movie as I've seen so far. The theme song was beautifully construct and so moving, but I just get disturbed when the same song is played multiple times throughout the movie, I can't help it. And Sia's song at the end?? WHAT THE F WAS THAT? I was furious when I heard it because the whole movie was such a great experience, and that ending, just when the emotionality peaked and we're truly content with it, so many people were crying, so many feelings, a lot to think about, and then, BOOM goes that upbeat, irritating pop song.

dbz83d4,"So I definitely can't fully relate to Saroo. I grew up very privileged (generally speaking) in the US. But as someone whose Indian father left their life for a while, I really connected with the ""I'm not really Indian"" line. Definitely a key part of who I am now, but I've been there too. 

That aside, I thought it was a good film. Still have it well behind La La Land and Moonlight, and maybe my personal bias came into play, but I enjoyed the acting (more so at the start), the score, and the ending was as powerful as it needed to be, given the buildup. ",5l16ve
dg7bl62,"Sorry to get off on a tangent but the attempted (and successful) kidnap scenes in the movie compelled me to google India's missing children.  To wit:  150-180 children a day kidnapped off India's streets.  Horrible situation.  

As much I enjoyed The Lion, that thought is lingering with me much longer than the movie's shining plot.  I regularly meet folks from India, smart, engaging people.  And everyone is supposed to give India and its peoples a pass on their child kidnap situation that they elect to ignore?  Criminal.",5l16ve
des3soi,"Little late here, but I just saw it and I wondered if anyone had discussed what I'm about to write below.

So, assuming the events in the movie are somewhat accurate, this really bugged me. When the kid is at the police station, they ask him where he lives. He says ""Ginestlay."" Obviously, that's not correct and none of them have heard of it.

But even in the 80s is there no fucking, like, book somewhere of ""Towns in India"" or anything? Like a City official or something?

I mean, I can excuse that, okay, since it's the 80s and they probably didn't really give a shit about trying to help some kid.

But then we go fast-forward to 2008 when Saruu is using Google. They didn't even show him trying to google ""Ginestlay"", but I mean, wouldn't it have been hilarious if Google had said, ""Did you mean Ganesh Talai?"" Or even go find a registry of towns in India, search by the Gs. Eventually he would have seen that name (pretty early on since it was G-a), and would have remembered how similar it sounded.

It just seems crazy that he found the town ""By accident"" instead of Googling when he had a pretty good idea of what the name phonetically sounded like.",5l16ve
ddydz2o,"Beautiful film but I have a question. Is the film supposed to have this really low contrast look with super milky blacks? I'm asking because the trailers (even though they rarely have final color timing) looked normal, but when I saw it, it's exactly like I described it. Messing with the contrast, it does look infinitely better, I kept being pissed at the color timer because it just dragged the visuals down.

Then again, Greig Fraser's work (the DP) on Rogue One, and other films bears that low contrast, slightly milky look.

An ""Asian or black kid"" could easily fall into the very general category of a ""brown boy."" I think she just meant that she always had a strong sense that she wanted to adopt a child from another country.

Kidman's character arc did bother me. They made her far too emotionally fragile. She didn't have a breakdown in the book, she didn't fall to pieces over Manosh, Saroo didn't stop speaking to her while looking for his real mum, and there was none of that ""I need you, Saroo"" stuff. She comes across as a loving but very capable, down-to-earth Australian mum. 

I think they just felt the need to make hundreds of hours of searching Google Earth more emotionally fraught than it really was, hence the whole Rooney Mara thing.

FYI, if you read the book (I just started it after seeing the movie) you learn very quickly that Saroo actually had two brothers, Guddu and another older one named Kallu that isn't even mentioned in the movie.

Chances are, they would cast an Asian actor with non-stereotypical features, such as large eyes and a thin nose in order to make the lead character more palatable to Western audiences.

I initially thought it was so sad that Guddu died never knowing that Saroo had been found, but then I realized he might have died before he ever even knew Saroo went missing. I hope he didn't realize Saroo was missing and then panic so much that he was struck by a train. 

My belief now is that Guddu left Saroo, got hit hit by a train, didn't return to Saroo, and then Saroo got lost. In that scenario, I'm glad Saroo didn't stumble across Guddu's body cut in half.

The self-injurious behavior represented onscreen (head banging, slapping head) as both a child and an adult suggest autism, and he was also depicted as a drug problem as an adult.

Regardless, all of this is unfortunate if untrue, and perhaps just as painful if true - Hobart is a small place, and it must be hard to outrun problems that have been made public.

The [script](http://la-screenwriter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/LION_Script_wCover_R31.pdf) adds that (fictional Mantosh) was a meth user:

>He holds his hand out, horizontal.
MANTOSH: ""I’m off the speed, mate.""
Perhaps his hand trembles, just a little; Saroo notices. 

I don't think they ultimately included that line in the movie, though.

Just in case you think I'm imagining things, here are some reviews of the movie that allude to the presence of fictional-Mantosh's drug problem in the movie:

From the New York Times [""He has a brother, Mantosh (Divian Ladwa), who was also adopted from India and has mental health and substance-abuse problems.""](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/24/movies/lion-review-dev-patel.html)

From Consequence of Sound: [""This often takes the form of their other adoptive Indian child, Mantosh (Divian Ladwa), a frustrated young man struggling with autistic fits and drug addiction.""](http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/12/film-review-lion/)

From the Sydney Morning Herald [""Mantosh (Divian Ladwa​) struggles with drink and drugs.""](http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/nicole-kidmans-vision-that-foreshadowed-her-role-in-lion-20161221-gtfxye.html)

From Critics at Large: [""Mantosh (Divian Ladwa) lives an itinerant, sometimes drug-addled life, his periodic disappearances plunging Sue into depression.""](http://www.criticsatlarge.ca/2017/02/finding-home-lion.html)

Additionally, Mantosh mentioned on his (public) Facebook page that he objected to being portrayed as a ""druggie,"" but I won't link to that here.",5l16ve

The main character, Saroo, is split up from his family at a very young age. As the film ends, they do the whole thing with text coming up in screen. ""Saroo was taken from his family for this long."" ""His mother did this while he was away"" ""His brother did this while he was away."" Ya know what it's like. Pretty standard stuff for this kind of movie.

Then it had a few paragraphs about this problem that is troubling India. ""Millions of children every year are accidentally taken from their families."" ""Though modern efforts have reduced his number, it's still an issue affecting thousands of families."" ""To learn more about this problem and how you can help, go to our website.""

While all this is going on, the screen is showing (behind the text) shots of the real life Saroo in his estranged village, and actors interacting with their real life counterparts. After the suggestion to check the website comes up the screen finally fades to black. The music is teaching an ending point. I figured the movie is done. Then a little bit more text pops up.

""After 25 years, Saroo learned that he had been mispronouncing his own name.""

""His name is actually Sheru. It is a Hindu word which means....""

Big bold letters center screen as the final note of the music chimes

""LION""

""If you found it strange that Saroo (Dev Patel) and Lucy (Rooney Mara) don't ever kiss in the movie but share plenty of embraces and time in bed together, this is because showing kissing in Indian movies is largely considered taboo and was almost never seen before the 1990s. Until recent years, the dictates of the censor board usually forbid it. This is why most Bollywood movies often cut away before the kiss or show people flirtatiously chasing each other around trees, etc. instead of kissing. The actors and filmmakers chose to show respect for Indian culture and help guarantee that Indian audiences accept the film.""

It doesn't even comparably sound like Indian music plus the lyrics felt way over the top and on the nose, like ""enough of those heavy thoughts and feelings you got there mate, here are some happy pictures, smile, lets dance"" what in the world.

dgbja9v,This is cute but family guys version was funnier. https://youtu.be/xBlwchTCHV0,5l16ve
de1wsa4,THANK YOU OMG,5l16ve

dew4nvu,TIL Thanks fam.,5l16ve
ddfsmm3,More like between St Kilda and Windsor. Could've sworn it was shot some point along Dandenong road. ,5l16ve
dchkp6v,"Aw snap I'll definitely check it out!

As someone with no expectations going into the movie, it was really good- you should check IT out!",5l16ve
ddikimv,"That's really good of you, I hope one day I have enough money to help.",5l16ve
ddw79ne,Thanks for what you do. All of us get caught up in our own lives and we forget about everyone else. People like you constantly try to make a better world for the less privileged ,5l16ve
di5gmw0,">  Maybe he felt so much shame and fear over losing his brother that he laid in front of a train.

That would make sense had he found Saroo dead, but I don't see why he would come to the point of killing himself without even knowing what happen to Saroo.  Something (or someone) is only lost once you've stopped looking for it.",5l16ve
devsbas,My guess was undocumented medical testing,5l16ve
de95nv2,"I seem to be one of the only ones who liked the romance. It was a plot device yes, but the relationship itself was not plastered over the story, rather going along in the background, we don't see there first kiss and the leading up to it for example, giving Lion another perspective apart from the family one.",5l16ve
ddojrxp,"It's really not though. In an ideal world, yes, you're right, but don't pretend that men aren't conditioned from birth to show less emotion than women.",5l16ve
di5gc3a,"What's really surprising is that there's no repository of those neighbourhoods anywhere. Even if there were 10,000 names to go through in the Gs, it would still not take too long before finding it going through a thousand names a day. If Google had the information, then certainly it must come from somewhere...",5l16ve
diefjot,"I'll check it out, Thanks!",5l16ve
dc7rq5c,"It was just weird. Not because she brought the child's race in, but that adds to it. Just the fact that she had a vision was weird. Even if she just said ""I saw a child standing at the edge of a field,"" it would've been off-putting still.",5l16ve

deckaqa,Link is dead.. You sure about that? ,5l16ve
dbxijul,"Absolutely agree, found it awkward in the book and found it awkward in the movie.",5l16ve
ddcfhi6,"Ah, I assumed Guddu died *before* Saroo got on the train, based on this...

>Guddu hadn't come home either after that night I was lost. My mother found out a few weeks later that he had died in a train accident. She had lost two sons on the same night.

...but you're right, we can't know for sure. The book later says:

>He might have assumed I went home, but he never went back to check, so it was hard not to think that if I hadn't boarded the train  that night, Guddu might have returned as planned and he'd still be alive now...I understood that I would have to accept I could never know the truth of what happened to my brother.",5l16ve
ddwy2i3,"Thank you.  Indeed that was one possibility I was thinking, that it was a memory/dream thing.",5l16ve
di5pagr,"Yeah I was leaning more towards an accident, hence why he never came back to get Saroo.  But the suicide thing did cross my mind.",5l16ve
de99t7p,I think it just added something that wasn't really needed. They could have featured more of his brother or more of his childhood.,5l16ve
dcpwisn,"I thought that was Saroo who went to Melbourne for Hotel Management?

Mantosh was just cutting about in his trailer.",5l16ve
dck5a1c,"Oh yes I forgot which character they were talking about since that was 3 weeks ago.

Don't take MIA literal. You know what I meant. She gave him shit for going in hiding when he was consumed with his search. ",5l16ve
det94ri,"That wasn't even a proper link wtf:

Is this guy a troll?",5l16ve
dej1muw,"I don't know about you. To me it was so revealing. Up until that point, I had no clue why she adopted those kids. My immediate assumption was, ok, she can't bear a child, then my second question was even if she can't bear a child, why adopt from India, why not from Australia. Her explanation of vision connected the dots and I felt complete and satisfying. God bless those couple for doing such a noble thing.",5l16ve

dfpqz5s,"The part where he is scolded is a memory that happened before the train station, when he is hit by the motorbike.",5l16ve
deehli0,I think it was mostly to show that he had a lot of good things going for him in aus. Therefore making everything that much harder for him. And making him feel that much more conflicted about his identity. ,5l16ve
dcpx6ii,Correct but op was referring to saroo I think ,5l16ve
dck7qzh,gotcha gotcha understood,5l16ve
df3jcfn,"Yeah, I had it chalked up to infertility, but that vision gave a solid backstory.",5l16ve
dj5ws2h,"Yeah, that's definitely possible. I assumed that because Saroo woke up in the dark and Guddu wasn't there, it must have been some time later than it *should* have been, indicating that Guddu's death was what prevented him from coming sooner. But even that is just Saroo's hazy memory. He also thought the train journey was much, much shorter than it was, so he couldn't really know how long Guddu had been gone.

So sad that poor children can be so anonymous in places like that.",5l16ve
